Applying Graph Theory in Ecological Research
Graph theory can be applied to ecological questions in many ways, and more insights
can be gained by expanding the range of graph theoretical concepts applied to a speciﬁc
system. But how do you know which methods might be used? And what do you do with
the graph once it has been obtained?
This book provides a broad introduction to the application of graph theory in different
ecological systems, providing practical guidance for researchers in ecology and related
ﬁelds. Readers are guided through the creation of an appropriate graph for the system
being studied, including the application of spatial, spatio-temporal, and more abstract
structural process graphs. Simple ﬁgures accompany the explanations to add clarity, and
a broad range of ecological phenomena from many ecological systems are covered. This
is the ideal book for graduate students and researchers looking to apply graph theoretical
methods in their work.

Preface
Applications of graph theory have been proliferating throughout ecology over the past
several decades, whether explicitly realized or implicit in the approaches used, and not
only in the cases which fall clearly into the popular category of networks. The reasons
for this increased interest are as diverse as the areas of research. A basic impetus is
that graphs and graph theory are about structure and provide the methods to analyze
structure as abstracted from almost any ecological (or other) system. The second rea-
son is the great popularity of network studies and network theory, originally applied to
social relationships, communications (including the Internet as a prime example), trans-
portation and the spread of disease. It is an obvious step to take network concepts and
models from these sources and see how well they apply to ecological systems. Such
network studies are obvious sources of inspiration for investigations of ecological inter-
actions of all kinds (such as predation, competition, mutualism and facilitation) using
the methods developed for those other systems. A third reinforcement for graph theory
applications arises from the growing sophistication of ecologists in analyzing spatial
data or time-ordered data or the complexities of spatio-temporal data; and, once again,
methods based on graph theory provide the right mix of simplicity of concept but ﬂex-
ibility in application to provide valuable insights that would otherwise be impossible.
Putting together interaction networks and spatio-temporal data brings a researcher to
the challenges and rewards of studying the interplay of form and function (or “pattern
and process” or “structure and dynamics”) in ecological systems in which both form
and function change through time by reciprocal inﬂuences and effects.
The book is organized in an order that reﬂects this range of sources. First is an intro-
duction to thinking with graphs based on the theme of graphs and structure (Chapters
1 and 2). There are then several chapters on ecological interaction networks, ﬁrst in
general (Chapter 3), followed by more speciﬁc topics: predation (Chapter 4), social
structure (Chapter 5), competition (Chapter 6) and mutualism (Chapter 7). The next
three chapters are about locational graphs, in which the nodes have positions in one or
more dimensions: time only (Chapter 8), space only (Chapter 9) and spatio-temporal
(Chapter 10). Chapter 11 describes approaches to studying the dynamics of networks
in the context of the reciprocal effects of form and function, focussing on the fascinat-
ing and promising methods based on graphlets. The last chapter (Chapter 12) attempts
to draw together a number of the themes that emerged throughout the book and pro-
vide a synthesis of the common threads; it also takes on the risky task of making some
predictions about future directions and developments to be expected in this ﬁeld.

Preface
xi
The working title started out as “Smart Things Ecologists Can Do with Graph The-
ory”; and that is a good description of the intention. The book is not primarily an intro-
duction to graph theory developed for ecologists; it is intended to make researchers
aware of the wide range of possibilities for their own research projects, even when (or
especially when) they have yet to be fully tried out in ecological systems. A prime
example is the many forms of analysis based on graphlets that are recently developed
and applied in other biological systems (e.g. protein-protein interactions) but not yet in
ecology. The goal is to provide enough background that the researcher knows how and
where to start and where to ﬁnd some examples that will provide inspiration and support.
The treatments of the various topics are very heterogeneous; some have a good range of
examples to be cited (e.g. food webs or trophic networks; mutualism), but others have
virtually none.
My own interest in graph theory as a useful approach to answering ecological ques-
tions related to structure started with my MSc research many years ago, and I owe a large
debt to my then-supervisor, Tony Yarranton, who suggested the area and encouraged my
exploration of the ﬁeld. I owe thanks to John Moon, who helped me understand some
of the more formal aspects of graph theory and its application (look at his Topics on
Tournaments, if you have not already: a great example). In acknowledging people who
have helped with this book, I thank the following for reading chapters, sometimes as
they developed: Alex Aravind, Tan Bao, Conan Vietch, JC Cahill and Brendan Wilson.
I thank Marie-Josée Fortin, especially; she read all the chapters, and some more than
once! For data used in examples, there are many to be acknowledged, including Tan Bao
and JC Cahill for the Arabadopsis competition tournament material and Gord Thomas
for the rich data set on Saskatchewan weed communities. I thank NSERC Canada and
UNBC for their support over many years.
I greatly enjoyed writing this book, and discovering all the exciting material I had
not known was very rewarding. It is my hope that the readers will ﬁnd the work equally
rewarding and that it will help create pathways to more that is useful, more that is new
and more that is surprising.

Graphs as Structure in the
Ecological Context
Introduction
Ecology is the study of organisms in the context of their environment, including both
abiotic effects and interactions among organisms. Ecologists, like other scientists, are
looking for patterns in these phenomena that can be used reliably to make predictions,
and those predictions can extend the ﬁndings to other organisms, to ecological systems
not yet studied or merely to similar groups of organisms in different places or at different
times. Those predictions may also refer to how a system’s form or structure determines
its function and dynamics and how function and dynamics constrain or modify structure
and form.
A long but not exhaustive list of the kinds of problems ecologists study might include
the following:
r the fate of individuals as determined by neighbours and environmental conditions
r the interactions of individuals in a social structure and their effects on population
dynamics
r the movement of individuals through their environment and their reactions to it
r the dynamics of populations and communities in fragmented habitats
r the ﬂow of energy and the population and community effects of predation in trophic
networks
r the effects of competition, both intra- and inter-speciﬁc, on survival, growth and
reproduction
r the dynamics of species interactions, such as mutualism, commensalism and para-
sitism
r the determinants of species composition of multi-species communities in island sys-
tems
Almost all of these can be approached in a theoretical or abstracted way, or quite explic-
itly with locations in time or space, and almost all of these are studied in the context
of a system of some sort and usually in the context of that system’s structure. In fact,
explicit references to “structure” arise in almost every study of ecological systems, from
behaviour to trophic networks and from individuals to community interactions. The term
“structure” usually refers to how systems are put together or to the relationships among
units that determine how they work together. Structure, like pattern, suggests some

predictability in the way a phenomenon is organized, even if the process that gives rise
to it has a random origin or stochastic component, such as the fates of individual organ-
isms. Even structures generated by fully random processes may have predictable char-
acteristics, as we will see in Chapter 3. Graph theory is the mathematics of the basics
of structure (objects and their connections), providing a rich technical vocabulary and
a formal treatment of the concepts and outcomes. Because of the importance of under-
standing and quantifying structure in all ecological systems, graph theory has important
contributions to make to a broad range of ecological studies, including trophic networks
(Kondoh et al. 2010), mutualisms (Bascompte & Jordano 2014), epidemiology (Meyers
2007) and conservation ecology (Keitt et al. 1997), where the graphs depict functional
connections among organisms or physical connections among spatially structured pop-
ulations (Grant et al. 2007).
The graphs that are the focus of graph theory are deceptively simple mathematical
objects, each consisting of a set of points with a set of lines joining them in pairs. The
points are called nodes, represented by dots in a diagram (Figure 1.1), and the lines are
edges, represented by straight or curving lines in a diagram, although a range of terms
can be found in the literature (see Harary 1969; West 2001).
Graphs are about connections and the pattern of connections. In a diagram of the
most basic graph, the positions of the nodes on the page and the lengths and shapes of
the edges joining them have no meaning; they are placed for convenience and clarity. It
is the set of connections made by the edges that determines the graph’s topology. The
nodes usually represent components or units of organization, and the essence of the
graph lies in what is connected to what: really very simple! In this way, the graph is an
abstract description of structure or topology because the edges show the relationships
among organizational components that the nodes represent.
Graphs and graph theory lend themselves extremely well to applications in many
areas of science because there is a wealth of mathematical knowledge that has been
developed over the years from studying these simple components. Graph theory inves-
tigates all aspects of combinations of nodes with edges joining them; and “all” is no
exaggeration. What is continually impressive about graph theory is the way that it can go
from what seems simple and intuitive to very sophisticated (and, yes, difﬁcult) results;
advances in recent decades have really changed the ﬁeld, and it has important links (pun
intended) to many other branches of mathematics, such as algebra, number theory and

topology. An obvious example is the application of graph theory to understanding the
properties and vulnerabilities of information networks like the Internet.
A second reason for the great value of graph theory for ecologists is the ﬂexibility
of the approach for meaningful applications to a range of ecological phenomena. This
is accomplished by including different characteristics in the graphs beyond the simple
nodes and edges. These include the following:
r node labels that identify the node as an individual and identiﬁable component of the
system, such as a species name; labels make a difference when counting the number
of different structures
r node weights that record qualitative or quantitative characteristics of the components,
such as relative abundance
r node locations: the nodes may have spatial or temporal locations, such as the time and
place of a single predation event; temporal location allows the possibility of nodes that
come into existence or cease to exist
and
r directions for the edges so that A to B is distinct from B to A
r signs for the edges, indicating positive or negative interactions between the nodes
r weights for the edges, or equations describing ﬂow or function
r locations for the edges, spatial or temporal, dependent on the locations of their end-
nodes; temporal location allows edges to come into existence or cease to exist
For example, nodes could represent identiﬁable landscape patches of known locations
in a particular year, with their areas as weights; the edges could be movement corridors
with weights related to how frequently or how easily the routes can be used for dispersal.
This introductory chapter describes the concepts and terminology that form the foun-
dations of a tour through graph theory and the smart ways to use it for understanding
ecological phenomena. This tour illustrates the assertion that these graphs are about
structure and the pattern of relationships that are the essence of structure. A subtle dis-
tinction here is that despite the fact that “graph” and “network” have come to be almost
synonymous, “graph theory” is still more about structure and “network theory” is more
about function and ﬂow.
1.1
Graphs as Structure
The branch of mathematics that we know as graph theory has arisen from a number of
different sources, developed to solve problems in diverse ﬁelds. The most famous of
these is Euler’s solution in 1736 to the “Königsberg bridge problem,” which concerned
walking routes around two islands in a river with seven bridges over it. By converting the
question into a general problem about graphs, it could be shown that a closed route that
crossed each bridge exactly once was impossible (Euler, as cited in Biggs et al. 1976).
This solution is usually cited as the beginning of graph theory, although Tutte (1998)
has suggested that the discipline might date back to ancient times and the study of

Platonic solids (tetrahedron, octahedron, etc.), which are essentially symmetric graphs
on the sphere. Another origin is Kirchhoff’s studies of 1847 (Biggs et al. 1976) on the
ﬂow of electricity through a network of circuits with different characteristics. A third
beginning is Cayley’s work on the combinatorics of the chemical structures of organic
compounds (e.g. butane and its isomer, isobutene) and the structurally different forms
any one chemical might take (Cayley 1857). Other possible sources of the discipline
include studies of map colouring problems (any map can be coloured with only four
colours), interactions between molecules in statistical mechanics and Markov chains
in probability theory (see Harary 1969, Chapter 1). I would, however, add a different,
fourth area to the list of inspirations, and that is the study of networks of positive and
negative interactions between individuals in a social setting, with developments due to
Harary and co-workers from the 1950s.
All these problems are clearly about structure, the structure associated with
1 spatial constraints on physical routes
2 energy ﬂow in a system with alternate pathways and different resistance characteris-
tics
3 physical forms from combinations of component units (atoms)
4 relationships in interaction networks
All these sources of graph theory as a branch of mathematics have close parallels in
ecological research, and all require, and take advantage of, different characteristics and
results developed in that discipline.
In mathematical terms, a graph is an object made up of two sets: nodes (also points or
vertices) and edges (the lines, also called arcs or links) that join pairs of nodes (Harary
1969; West 2001; see Box 1.1). Therefore, graph G can be seen as an ordered pair of
sets V and E:
G = (V, E) with E being pairs of the elements of V.
Less formally,
graph = {nodes} and {edge joining pairs of nodes}; say n nodes and m edges.
The density of edges is measured by the connectance, which is the proportion of
possible edge positions actually occupied; here 2m/n (n −1). (This is not the same
as a graph being connected, with a path between any two nodes, nor is it the same
as connectivity, which measures how difﬁcult it is to separate a connected graph into
pieces.)
In contemporary usage, the terms “graph” and “network” are used interchangeably
as equivalents (Estrada 2012), although previous practice was to reserve “network” for
graphs or digraphs which had a real number (weight) assigned to each edge (Harary
1969), such as those in trophic networks or transportation systems. Digraph networks,
with directed edges, are frequently used to study the ﬂow of material or information,
one of the most important applications of graph theory, and for such applications, each
edge can have several weights, including capacity, ﬂow and cost (Bang-Jensen & Gutin
2009).

Graph theory is usually introduced by formal development, and we cannot avoid that
altogether; but we will introduce much of the basic terminology through an example,
not trying to cover everything, with more to be introduced in later sections as required.
The introductory narrative will be complemented by a checklist table of terms (Box
1.2) as well as the ﬁgures that go with them. This book also has a Glossary that collects
almost all of the terms introduced throughout the chapters in one place.
To start with an instructive and almost-ecological example, consider children on a
playground. Each child is represented by a node of a graph, G, and a simple edge is used
to indicate which children are playing together during an observation period (Figure
1.2). There may be large and small groups, or individuals may play mostly alone. We
can use graph-theoretical properties to evaluate this social structure for average number
of playmates, maximum number of shared-play relationships between any two children
and so on, and to determine the most coherent clusters. Each child has a name, and so
each node has a natural label. The degree of a node is the number of edges attached to
it, the number of nodes that are its neighbours. In the playground example, the degree
is the number of shared-play interactions, ranging from 1 (nodes G or J) to 5 (node E),
averaging around 2.5.
In Figure 1.2, all the children are joined together by at least one sequence of edges
through the graph, so that a rumour that is passed only between these pairs of playmates
will reach all children. That is, the graph is connected, because there is a path along
nodes and edges between any pair of nodes. It will become disconnected, however, if
child K leaves (that node is a cut-point) or if B and K become estranged and no longer
play together (edge BK is a cut-edge) (see Figure 1.2, bottom). There are two obvious
clusters or modules, AIH and BCDE, which are subgraphs of the whole structure. A

subgraph of G is itself a graph of which the nodes are a subset of the nodes of G and
the edges are a subset of the edges of G.
Each node can also be categorized by age and gender, and so it can be determined
in which categories the graph is assortative (most edges between nodes in the same
category) or disassortative (most edges between nodes in different categories). In our
playground example, the graph tends to be associative for age, mainly because of the
clique (a complete subgraph, i.e. with all nodes joined to all nodes) of four older children
(B, C, D and E), as shown in Figure 1.3 (top).
Further properties include a weight for each node, such as the total time on the play-
ground, and weights for each edge, such as the total time or proportion of time the two
children play together (Figure 1.3, bottom). The simple graph of nodes and edges in the
ﬁgure is aspatial; space is not explicitly included, but the data on which it is based are
probably truly spatial, if they were to be thus recorded. For example, some groupings
may tend to spend their time by the slides and others by the swings. For some purposes,
this spatial information could be included in the graph. Similarly, the graph shown is
atemporal, but an explicitly temporal graph could be created by recording the different
combinations of children at different times of day or by recording the changing links as
friendships form and dissolve, evidenced by shared time on the playground. The latter
approach gives a dynamic graph or network.
Of course, there are many different ways to deﬁne the edges of a graph for the same
children in the playground. For example, with children, unlike some of the animals we
study, we can complement the observational data by asking them their opinions of the

AIH with three edges form a cycle. Nodes BCDE with their six edges form a subgraph, a
complete graph and a module. The (undirected) graph (top) becomes a digraph (directed graph)
(bottom) based on “Who is your best friend?”
others: Who do they like? Who is their best friend? and so on. This gives edges that have
direction, because B may consider C to be their best friend, but the “best friend” rela-
tionship is not always reciprocated (Figure 1.4). Directional edges allow the inclusion of
asymmetric relationships. They also mean that the degree of each node can be divided
according to “arrow toward” edges, in-degree, and “arrow away” edges, out-degree. (In
the digraph of Figure 1.4, node E has an in-degree of 2 and an out-degree of 1.)
So far only edges of shared play or liking, which are positive edges, have been
included in the graph, but it might also include negative edges indicated pairs that never
play together or that actively avoid each other; this gives signs to the edges creating a
signed graph (Figure 1.5). By allowing asymmetric “like” and “dislike” for any pair of
nodes, the graph then has edges that are signed and directed, allowing A to B to dif-
fer from B to A (see nodes K and E in Figure 1.5b). To reﬁne further to include the
intensity of “like” and “dislike,” the edges may also have quantitative weights. In a real
study of social structure, it would be interesting to compare the graph based on observed
behaviour and the graph based on stated opinion . . .
A child shows up with a bad cold one day, and the cold spreads among the children
from playmate to playmate following the edges of the shared-play graph. How far and
fast the cold spreads will depend in part on the position of the initial carrier in the social
network, how well connected and how central within the whole population (compare
nodes B and J). The spread of the disease will follow a path in that graph consisting of
a series of nodes and the edges joining them. In a path, the elements are not re-used,
and in this case, the disease does not return to a child who has already had it, and so no
cycles are formed. (A cycle is a path that ends where it began, such as A – H – I – A

in Figure 1.2.) A connected graph without cycles is called a tree. The trace of the disease
through the shared-play graph is a subgraph that is a tree (Figure 1.6); the nodes are the
same as in the original graph, but the edges representing the relationships are different.
The edges could be labelled with directions if the actual process of disease spread was
known, and they could also be labelled with dates or the order of infection if those
data were available. The nodes of a tree are called “leaf” nodes if they have degree 1;
“branch” nodes have degree 2 or higher; and the “root” node is a specially designated
node that is functionally unique, such as the common ancestor in a phylogeny or the
river mouth in a drainage basin, with its meaning depending on the application.

help coach them in their math skills. This creates a new set of edges that can replace
the friendship edges of shared play; with the nodes representing the same individuals
and the edges now representing that coaching relationship (Figure 1.7). Here the edges
all join older to younger children, with no edges within either age cohort, giving what
is called a bipartite graph for obvious reasons. In our example, the graph is discon-
nected (some nodes not joined by a path) and consists of four components (connected
subgraphs).
This narrative has introduced some of the most ecologically important aspects of
graphs. These are the basics only and more terms and concepts are introduced through-
out the chapters that follow. All are provided in the Glossary at the end of the book.
1.2
Graphs and Ecological Relationships
The objects in ecological studies, which are to be the nodes of a graph, are often individ-
ual organisms, populations, communities, or deﬁned spatial areas like habitat patches;
and the objects are linked by physiological, behavioural, physical and dispersal pro-
cesses. The edges between objects vary in weight and in vulnerability versus persis-
tence, according to the nature and intensity of the ecological processes. Research in the
related ﬁelds of evolutionary biology, population genetics and epidemiology, have as
the usual objects individual organisms or other units such as taxa, traits, genes, molec-
ular markers and so on. The edges between these nodes are the relationships of evo-
lutionary history, functional pathways, measured similarity or ecological interactions.
Graphs of these systems have the objects as nodes and their relationships as the edges
(Harary 1969; West 2001; Bang-Jensen & Gutin 2009; Lesne 2006; Kolaczyk 2009).
These graphs of relationships can be thought of as “abstracted” structures, because they

have been derived from but taken out of the spatial and temporal contexts in which the
information originated. In these studies, organisms and interactions have been modelled
and analyzed for several decades using graphs and networks that are therefore aspatial
and atemporal (Dale 1977a, 1977b; Proulx et al. 2005; Lesne 2006; Mason & Verwoerd
2007; Dale & Fortin 2010).
Graph theory has seen further signiﬁcant applications in trophic network studies (Pas-
cual & Dunne 2006; Kondoh et al. 2010), conservation ecology (Keitt et al. 1997; James
et al. 2005), epidemiology (Shirley & Rushton 2005; Meyers 2007), and mutualisms
(Bascompte & Jordano 2014). Graphs are used now in ecology for many applications
depicting physical or functional connectivity among organisms (predation, pollination,
competition and other forms of interactions; Bascompte 2009) or among spatially struc-
tured groupings of local populations (metapopulations [Fagan 2002; Grant et al. 2007],
although the actual locations are not retained for analysis), and they can obviously
be used for more. Where the locations in time or space are not explicitly maintained
for analysis, many of these resulting interaction graphs or networks might be called
abstracted interaction graphs.
1.3
Graphs and Locations: Spatial and Temporal
Much of the ecological data we collect originate each from a particular place at a par-
ticular time, and ecological systems usually have some spatial and temporal structure.
It therefore makes sense to maintain the locations of observations for analysis, although
summarizing over time and space may provide its own insights. This gives rise to graphs
of the ecological systems in which the nodes (and possibly the edges) have locations in
space or in time, or in both. Although many of the phenomena that inspired the devel-
opment of graph theory were actually spatial (walking routes, electric circuits, maps,
etc.), the graphs originally were not, but simpliﬁed the problems by removing the spa-
tial context to become simpliﬁed combinatorial entities. In many of these applications,
the locations of events in time or space are maintained explicitly for analysis, giving
what might be called “locational graphs.”
1.3.1
Spatial Graphs
In spatial graphs, the nodes have locations that provide an explicit spatial context and
spatial meaning. The end-points of the edges obviously have locations, too, but any
edge may not reﬂect the trajectory of any thing moving through space but may be an
abstract indication of a relationship between the nodes. For example, an edge might be
the pseudo-trajectory of a seed from its parent tree to where the seedling is eventually
found; that trajectory is usually unknown. In Figure 1.8, the nodes are sites in a land-
scape, the edges represent the shortest set of connections between sites according to the
rule of a Minimum Spanning Tree; the details of the landscape will determine whether
they represent practical routes of dispersal. On the other hand, the edges between nodes
may have physical locations, as well as other characteristics such as length and width,

as in the case of hedgerows being dispersal connections for small mammals across an
agrarian landscape. In this case, the level of abstraction is low and our spatial graph has
become very much like a map of the system it portrays. If the corridors are actually
more important than the patches, the original graph can be reformatted as its line graph;
the original edges are now the nodes and the new edges indicate which pairs of the orig-
inal edges shared nodes (Figure 1.9). In this conversion, the degree of any node created
in the line graph is 2 less than the sum of the degrees of the original end-nodes; for
example, the degree of node BE in the line graph in Figure 1.9 is d(B) + d(E) – 2 = 5.
A great example of where this kind of duality might be of interest comes from studies
of mycorrhizal networks: Southworth et al. (2005) found different network topologies

when the Quercus garryana trees were the nodes and the fungi were the links com-
pared to the fungi being the nodes and the trees the links. In the ﬁrst case, the network
appeared random with a short tail to the distribution of edges per node; in the second,
the results were consistent with a “scale-free” model (more on this later) suggesting that
some of the fungal species act as hubs in the network.
A key characteristic of edges in a spatial graph is the meaning of “distance.” A path
is an alternating sequence of nodes and edges joining them from u to v that uses no ele-
ment more than once. The basic measure of distance between two nodes is the smallest
number of edges in a path between them, called the geodesic distance. These distances
are not always symmetric; in a digraph, for example, δ(u,v) and δ(v,u) may be differ-
ent. If the edges have weights, the graph theory distance between two nodes δ(u,v) is
the smallest total of weights in any path from node u and to node v. (A walk is also an
alternating series of nodes and their edges that lead from node u to v; but its compo-
nents may be used more than once, whereas a path may use an element only once [see
Glossary].)
In a spatial graph, the edge euv has a weight that is the spatial distance between the
nodes, call it duv or ds(u,v) for clarity. This means that there are two distances between
nodes: the simple spatial distance duv between the locations of the two nodes (which is
the same as ds(u,v) if there is an edge between them), and the spatial distance along the
shortest path, which is the sum of the spatial lengths of the edges in that path; call it
dp(u,v) with “p” for “path.” Figure 1.10 illustrates these meanings of distance. Again,
digraphs are different because of possible asymmetries; in fact in sparse digraphs, dis-
tance may be “inﬁnite” because there is no path between some pairs of nodes. In the

The distance from B to A is 38, but B cannot be reached from A.
1.3.2
Temporal and Time-Only Graphs
There are many terms for graphs with nodes that have locations in time but not in space;
“temporal graphs” is obviously one, and “time-varying” and “time-ordered” are other
possibilities, as is “time-only graph” where it is the correct description. The nodes are
located in time, and they may come into being or cease to be at particular points or
in particular periods in time. Graphs in which the nodes come and go may be “time-
ordered,” but the same description can apply where the nodes persist but the edges
appear and disappear. Figure 1.11 shows the example of a time-ordered graph of ﬁve
persistent nodes observed over more than 20 time periods; the edges represent short-
lived contacts between pairs of nodes, at most one per time period. Obviously the ﬂow
of information or material through the system depends on the order in which the nodes
or edges form and disappear. In a system of three nodes and two time-ordered edges,
A–B–C, information or disease cannot ﬂow from A to C if the B–C edge ceases to exist
before the A–B edge is formed. It is not common for a graph of an ecological study
to include only temporal locations without space, but these do occur, and they have a
chapter of their own (Chapter 8).
Some graphs change their structure through time, or they may document a struc-
ture that controls or inﬂuences how a system behaves through time. These are called
“dynamic graphs” (Harary & Gupta 1997) or more commonly “dynamic networks”
(Casteigts et al. 2011), described in Section 1.4 which follows.
1.3.3
Spatial-Temporal Graphs
In spatio-temporal graphs, the nodes have locations both in time and in space, as the
term suggests. The comments about the locations of edges apply in this spatio-temporal

context, too, just as in the purely spatial case. They exist in a spatial and temporal con-
text and their end-points have locations, but they themselves may not portray actual tra-
jectories (Figure 1.12), standing as “pseudo-trajectories” perhaps. Both time and space
may each be either continuous or discrete, although most applications in ecology and
related ﬁelds divide time into discrete units like days or years.
1.3.4
Aspatial and Atemporal Graphs
In aspatial graphs, space has no explicit role in the structure and presentation, so that
the positions of the nodes and edges convey no meaning. The subtlety is that “aspatial”
is not identical to “non-spatial”; it is a more neutral term rather than negative. The infor-
mation in an aspatial graph may be derived from truly spatial data; for example, a graph
of pairwise species-to-species neighbour associations is derived from the frequencies of
neighbour occurrences in the spatial context of a plant community, but spatial relations
are summarized, not retained, in the resulting graph. A non-spatial graph has no spatial
component, neither explicitly nor implicitly. To parallel “aspatial,” “atemporal graphs”
are those in which the data may have a temporal component, but it is not explicit in the
graphs.
1.3.5
Spatial Statistics and Local Statistics on Graphs
In the preceding sections, graphs have been discussed relative to locations in space and
in time, with those dimensions being prior and external to the graph. A graph can also
be seen as creating its own “space,” with its own measure(s) of location, which can be
very useful in studies of ecological networks that are abstracted from physical dimen-
sions. This is not the same as embedding a graph in Euclidean n-space (see Erdös et al.
1965), but rather using the simple measure of geodesic distance (Figure 1.10) to provide
the “space.” Within this deﬁned space, many methods based on standard spatial analysis
or spatial statistics can be applied, even if the locations are not spatial in the traditional
sense and the familiar rules of Euclidean space may be violated. This is different from
the approach described by Okabe and co-authors, who apply familiar spatial analysis

(such as Ripley’s K function for point pattern analysis) to events that are constrained
to occur on networks of linear structures that are embedded in “real space” (see Okabe
& Sugihara 2012). The transfer of techniques from Euclidean space to “graph space”
requires caution because of potential violations of the usual assumptions; however, with
the correct adaptation and interpretation, almost any analysis that might be performed
on grid or lattice data can be used for the irregular structure created by a non-lattice
graph. For example, the observed node weights in a graph can be analyzed for autocor-
relation using any appropriate statistic (e.g. Moran’s I) with the distance classes deﬁned
by geodesic distance. Figure 1.13 provides the simple example of a ring graph with node
weights of 1 to 4; Pearson’s correlation is positive for distances of 1 and 5, and nega-
tive for distances of 2, 3 and 4. This allows an ecologist access to a rich set of familiar
analytical tools to explore the structural characteristics of abstracted networks as if they
were spatial data.
For spatial statistics and indices of spatial structure, measures of characteristics in
“graph space” can be created both in the global form, summarizing for the entire graph,
and in the local form, focussed on one particular part of the graph rather than the whole.
For example, from network analysis comes the concept of assortativity: the graph is
assortative if nodes with similar characteristics tend to be neighbours, joined by edges
or short paths. This is positive “spatial” autocorrelation. The opposite is a graph that is
disassortative (having negative autocorrelation): neighbours tend to be less similar. This
property can be assigned to the whole graph as a global measure, or it may be regional
within the graph, with some regions highly assortative, and others disassortative (see
Piraveenan et al. 2008; Thedchanamoorthy et al. 2014). As an example, Figure 1.14
shows a graph in which the left half is assortative for the category of the nodes (many
edges join nodes of the same colour), but the right half is disassortative (many edges join

nodes of different colours). The concept of local versus global evaluation can prove very
useful in assessing the information in a graph or network that is itself heterogeneous
(e.g. species interaction networks that are divided into compartments), or subject to
non-stationarity (e.g. time-only graphs of interactions over a long time scale). Again,
what can be done for information in graph-deﬁned space mirrors closely the analysis
options available for standard spatial data, which may prove especially useful as a route
to understanding the structure of long-term or “big” data such as relating community
composition and phylogeny, or modularity in microbial consortia responding to changes
in hosts and environmental conditions.
1.4
Networks and Dynamics
With the growing popularity of networks for many and varied ecological applications,
the term “network” has entered our ecological vocabulary from a variety of sources,
so much so that it has become informally equivalent to “graph” as a general term for
these abstracted structural models. Sometimes “network” is still used in a more narrow
sense, referring to a graph with directed and weighted edges, used to depict or to ana-
lyze system function. These networks are often dynamic, changing in structure or with
quantitative characteristics that change through time. These two cases are not identical,
but obviously related. In some applications, the network is an atemporal (and frequently
aspatial) summary of system function; think of a trophic network with average annual
energy ﬂows associated with each edge linking an organism of one trophic level to a
consumer in the level one above it. In general, these are abstracted graphs, removed
from the spatial and temporal context in which the data originally resided.

1 Graphs as Structure in the Ecological Context
Of particular interest to ecologists are those graphs or networks in which the structure
affects the dynamic function of the system it describes, as you would expect, but the
processes that occur on the structure are able to change the structure itself. This is a
variant on the familiar “pattern and process” or “structure and function” interaction
seen in many areas of ecological study. Because these structures permit considerable
complexities, they deserve a chapter all their own, and that is Chapter 11, far ahead,
although the theme will recur in the intervening material.
1.5
Graphs and Data
Typically, ecological studies gather data, synthesize information from the data, analyze
that information and interpret the results. To take advantage of graph theory, the data
have to be converted to a graph (of course). How this is done depends on the nature of
the data and the analysis method; the latter may determine the format of the graph. A
graph portrayed as a diagram is good for intuitive understanding (hence so many ﬁgures
in this book), and in fact one primary function of data as a graph is to facilitate the
visualization and exploration of the data, including scanning for mistakes and anoma-
lies (see Raymond & Hosie 2009). Beyond visual presentation and interpretation, most
analyzes require computation and that requires a digital format for the information, and
hence a good reason for the representation of graphs by matrices. Matrices for graphs
can be generated in many ways, each emphasizing different features of the graph, or
facilitating particular calculations.
Creating and handling these matrices becomes especially important for very large, or
“massive,” data sets (e.g. the Internet; see Newman 2010, Plate 1), which are just too
large to be appreciated intuitively (see Hampton et al. 2013). Just displaying such large
data sets as graphs requires specialized software (see Kolaczyk & Csárdi 2014). Some
ecological applications may include huge numbers of nodes, especially where there are
long time series and large spatio-temporal data sets (e.g. the exploratory analysis of
sea surface temperature records, illustrated in Cressie & Wikle 2011, Chapter 5). Very
large graphs provide great opportunities, rich with information and outcomes, but they
present challenges for data conversion and processing, and visualization may require
extra effort to detect the important patterns in the structure.
The descriptions of converting ecological data into graphs and of representing graphs
as matrices can be presented in either order, but the data-to-graph procedure may depend
on the graph format required, and so it makes sense to begin with the graph-as-matrix
material. Of course, knowing the format required for the analysis should inform the
development of the sampling or experimental procedure before it is carried out (the
usual advice, ignored at our peril!).

This is the technical part of the discussion, but it is necessary to understand the basics
of how the graphs are represented and analyzed. A matrix is an array of numbers,

position in the array. It conveys numerical information in a compact format that facil-
itates manipulation and analysis, and matrices are fundamental to computer programs
and software packages.
Most ecologists are familiar with matrices as commonly used in multivariate analysis
such as principle components analysis or multivariate regression analysis. The matrices
for graphs should seem less daunting because the entries in the matrices are often easy
integers, and frequently just 0s and 1s (and −1s).
Given that a basic graph can be deﬁned as the ordered pair of sets of nodes and edges,
themselves ordered pairs of the nodes
graph = ({nodes} , {edges joining pairs of nodes}) = ({vi}, {(vi, vj)}),
a simple data structure is a list of the pairs of nodes joined by the edges. If the n nodes
are identiﬁed by integer labels, 1 to 6 in Figure 1.15, a list of the m edges can be created
and the list is essentially a 2 × m matrix: [(1,2), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,5)]. An
alternative is an adjacency matrix, A, which is a square n × n matrix with elements
aij = 1 when nodes i and j are joined by an edge, and 0 otherwise. For the graph in 1.15,
the adjacency matrix A1 is

1 Graphs as Structure in the Ecological Context
For a basic simple graph, a node cannot be adjacent to itself and so the entries on
the main diagonal are not just zeros but structural zeros, which means that by deﬁnition
they cannot be anything else but 0, and they are indicated by bold font.
One interpretation of the matrix A is that it shows the number of walks of length
1 between nodes i and j. What is helpful about this interpretation is that A2 gives the
number of walks of length 2 between nodes i and j, A3 the walks of length 3 and so
on. These counts include walks that begin and end at the same node and may re-use
other elements; so these are not true “paths” in graph theory terminology. The result is
that the major diagonal is no longer structural zeros, but the number of closed walks of
the designated length that begin and end at node i. In A2 these are “cycles” of length 2,
which begin and end at the same node by going out and back on the same edge, therefore
also giving the node’s degree, which is just the number of such edges.

The same basic information from the adjacency matrix, A, can be contained in the
n × m incidence matrix, B, in which the rows are the nodes and the columns are the
edges, with elements bik = 1 when node i is an end-point of edge k, and 0 otherwise. By
convention, the edges are labelled in the lexicographical order of their nodes pairs (i.e.
in order ﬁrst by the lower label, and by the higher label if the lower labels are tied). For
a digraph (a graph with directed edges), the incidence matrix has values 1, 0 and −1 as
follows: bik = 1 when node i is the source of edge k, bik = −1 when node i is the sink
of edge k, and 0 otherwise.

This matrix is important in graph theory because it can be used to determine certain
characteristics, such as the number of spanning trees (subgraphs with no cycles that join
all nodes) or the number of connected components (see Newman 2010, Chapter 6). It
is also an important approach to understanding the properties of random walks on the
original graph; these are walks that develop by iteratively choosing the next node to be
included at random from those available by edges from its current node (Figure 1.22; see
also Section 1.7.5). The various matrices related to the adjacency matrix provide clear
algorithmic alternatives for exploring a graph and determining its properties (e.g. cycles,
blocks, random walk . . . ), often based on the eigenvalues of a matrix. These properties
will be discussed at greater length as they come up in the chapters that follow.

1.5 Graphs and Data

1.5.2
From Data to Graphs
The advice always given is to determine the analysis to be performed on the data to be
collected before sampling or running experiments to obtain the data. Good advice is not
always taken, but the form of the data limits the form of the graph that can be derived;
for example, sampling that is itself symmetric cannot give asymmetric data or directed
graphs (e.g. “A then B” is asymmetric information, but “A and B” is symmetric) whereas
sampling that is asymmetric produces asymmetric data, which can be aggregated to
symmetric outcomes, thus allowing either directed or non-directed graphs. The match
or mismatch of spatial and temporal scales of the phenomenon being investigated and
the sampling and analysis being carried out also has to be considered as an important
part of the relationship between phenomenon and data, and between data and analysis
(see Dale & Fortin 2014, Figure 1.8).
A few examples can illustrate the relationship between design and outcome: the data,
the analyses and the graphs.
1. The ﬁrst is from plant ecology, where a common approach is to investigate the com-
munity structure of positive and negative associations between pairs of species using
density or presence-absence data. Plants of two species may tend to occur close together
because they have similar ecological properties or because of some positive inﬂuence
of one on the other. Plants of different species may tend to occur farther apart because
they have divergent ecological properties or because there is some negative inﬂuence
of one species on the other. Some of these causes are most likely symmetric (shared or
divergent ecological properties) and others are more likely to be asymmetric (positive
or negative inﬂuence), and the sampling scheme may be designed to account for that
fact.
A standard approach is to record the presence and absence of all species in each of
many small quadrats, randomly or systematically arranged. The data are used to create
graphs of the inter-speciﬁc associations of pairs of species (also known as constella-
tion diagrams or phytosociological structure). For each pair of species, A and B, any
quadrat belongs to one of four categories: both present; A present, B absent; A absent,
B present; both absent. The counts of quadrats in the four categories form a 2 × 2 contin-
gency table and each pair of species can be assessed using a goodness-of-ﬁt test with the
X2 or G statistic compared with the χ2 distribution. There are many problems in treat-
ing this as a reliable statistical test, because of various sources of non-independence. It
does, however, provide a standard by which edges between species (the nodes) can be
determined for a graph of “signiﬁcant” inter-speciﬁc associations; this graph has nodes
representing species and signed edges joining some pairs, and so the result resembles
Figure 1.5a. The edges are sometimes shown as lines of different thicknesses indicat-
ing the strength of the associations. The symmetric sampling design will not permit
distinguishing between possible effects of A on B from possible effects of B on A.
To determine asymmetric associations for graphs with directed edges, the sampling
must have asymmetry in its design. One such is “point-contact” sampling. Dimension-
less points are set out in random or regular arrangements and at each such location
the ﬁrst species contacted by the point sample is recorded, together with the species

closest to the initial contact that is different from the initial species. The resulting data
set consists of ordered pairs of species frequencies: (initial contact, nearest neighbour to
contact point). These data can be evaluated using a goodness-of-ﬁt test, although there
are technical details to consider (Dale et al. 1991). These data provide the basis for an
asymmetric graph of pairwise associations for further analysis; the nodes are species
with signed directed edges joining some pairs, thus resembling Figure 1.5b.
The third method for deriving association graphs requires identiﬁable individuals that
can be mapped, like tree stems in a forest. Given the location and species of each stem,
the counts of the species of neighbours, variously deﬁned, can be determined for each
species and analysis will detect unusually rare or common neighbours for each. Neigh-
bours can be deﬁned in a number of different ways, whether based on a quantitative dis-
tance threshold (e.g. 1.5 m), or using “topological” deﬁnitions of neighbours in spatial
graphs (Figure 1.16 provides an example), such as the Minimum Spanning Tree (Figure
1.8), or other such rules for spatial graphs described below. Whatever the deﬁnition of
neighbours, to produce a spatial graph of the site, an abstracted association graph for
the community is based on signiﬁcant deviation of neighbour frequencies from those
expected based on complete spatial randomness.
2. The second example is of the interactions between two identiﬁable groupings of
species, such as plants and their pollinators or herbivores and their predators, so that
the resulting graph is bipartite, with two non-overlapping subsets of nodes, and with
the graph’s edges running between the subsets, not within (Figure 1.17). One intriguing
question about these interactions is whether specialist species on one side tend to pair
up with specialists on the other side of the interaction or whether there is a tendency for
specialists to pair only with generalists (a “nested” arrangement, see Figure 1.17). The
strength of any of these interactions is usually determined from some “surrogate” that is
easier to observe (see Bascompte & Jordan 2014, Figure 3.7; Vázquez et al. 2005a). The
data from which these graphs are produced are usually (1) counts of interaction events,

such as the number of visits of pollinators of species X to ﬂowers of species Y or (2)
quantitative measures, such as the amount of biomass of herbivore Y removed or con-
sumed by predator Z. Most such data are derived from in situ ﬁeld work of observation
or sampling.
The count data can be converted into complete bipartite graphs, with all possible
edges included, each weighted by the count of the pairwise-speciﬁc events. An alterna-
tive is to convert the count frequency data, call it fXY, into proportions p•Y or pX• by
dividing by the plant total or by the pollinator total. These values, associated with all
possible edges, can then be used to determine which edges to include in the graph using
a threshold value (Figure 1.17).
3. The third example concerns food webs, which are trophic interaction networks.
These are generally intended to be quantitative and attempt to be complete, both in the
interactions that are quantiﬁed and in the species that are included. Taxonomically dif-
ﬁcult groups are often aggregated, giving large groupings of taxa such as “grasses” or
“centric diatoms” or “parids”; an alternative to taxonomic groupings is to aggregate by
function, such as “grazers” versus “browsers.” The data that contribute to the construc-
tion of a trophic network graph include biomass estimates from destructive sampling,
observations of encounter rates, trapping, feeding preferences, stomach content analy-
sis, caloriﬁc measurements and so on. While demanding, the data collected produce a
network graph of great richness and clear value for further study. Figure 1.18 shows a
simpliﬁed trophic network for the Kluane boreal ecosystem based on a truly enormous
amount of effort over decades of study and a very wide range of estimates, measures
and observations (see Krebs 2010 and references therein).
To conclude this section, Table 1.1 lists some of the features of the three examples
just discussed as a summary and with added notes or comments for consideration. A
speciﬁc comment at the end of the table offers consoling advice on how to deal with the
common problem of incomplete data, always a concern for ﬁeld-based studies.

1.6 Ecological Hypotheses and Graph Theory
27
ecological research, we have only partial and incomplete information on which to base
our conclusions. Some of these are data zeros, not structural zeros; that is, there is
no observation although one is possible (structural zeros occur where no observa-
tion is possible). One approach to evaluating the importance of this incompleteness
is sub-sampling known-to-be incomplete data, and by calculating the measures of inter-
est for each sub-sample to determine the ﬁndings’ robustness to missing information
(Naujokaitis-Lewis et al. 2013). This is much like bootstrapping, but not intended to
determine statistical signiﬁcance (for more on this technique in other applications, see
Efron & Tibshirani 1993; Manly 2006). This approach is not the same as sampling a
graph or network, to be followed by making inferences about the whole from the sam-
ple (see Kolaczyk 2009), nor is it the same as techniques to identify missing or spurious
edges and thus to reconstruct its graph and reﬁne the determination of properties (see
Giumerà & Sales-Pardo 2009).
The three chosen examples are all of abstracted graphs, rather than locational graphs
for which the locations of nodes in time or space are retained explicitly. The relationship
between data and graph is conceptually simple for locational cases. The nodes represent
objects or events that have coordinates in time or space, and you just have to record
them (sounds easy!). Of course, the practicalities of actually doing this may be daunting,
expensive or overwhelmingly detailed. The maps of tree stems are locational graphs, as
would be the space-time coordinates of bees’ visits to orchid ﬂowers, or of goshawk-hare
encounters (labelled as to outcome). Much locational data is now collected by automatic
tracking systems, such as radio-collared elk or “tagged” sharks, but the older methods
of mark-recapture or trapping also provide data for location-speciﬁc graphs for further
analysis. Locational data are essential for studies related to diversity and conservation,
examining features such as community composition, genetic structure and patterns of
dispersal through fragmented landscapes, all of which can be helped by the use of graph
theory as will be detailed in Chapter 9 (see, among many others, Urban & Keitt 2001;
Saura et al. 2014; Watts et al. 2015; Rayﬁeld et al. 2011; Fall et al. 2007; James et al.
2005).
1.6
Ecological Hypotheses and Graph Theory
The relationship between hypotheses and analysis is often iterative in ecological
research. The hypothesis determines the data required and the analysis that is carried
out; but usually the results of the analysis generate new hypotheses which lead to further
and reﬁned studies. Graph theory lends itself well to this iterative process, particularly
because it provides a natural approach to hierarchical analysis.
Hierarchical frameworks for hypothesis testing work best when each level of evalua-
tion is independent of the previous levels, but this is not always possible and our hierar-
chical layers of tests may not be mutually independent. The most challenging task can
be the translation of the ecological hypothesis into a well-formulated and testable for-
mal hypothesis in the language of statistics or graph theory. The ecological hypothesis
determines the formal hypothesis and the data and other information that are required to

test it. These then determine the analytical approach, and the results inform the decision
to reject the formal hypothesis or not. This decision is then used to evaluate the original
ecological hypothesis.
In the many publications on applications of graph theory in non-mathematics (e.g.
biology, technology or sociology), it is interesting how rarely the testing of hypotheses
or evaluations of statistical signiﬁcance are included explicitly. The many discussions of
measures of graph or network properties, and many comparisons with various random
“null models,” are rarely formulated in these terms.
As an introductory example, consider the hierarchy of spatial neighbour networks
described in Dale and Fortin (2014) and shown in Figures 1.19a, 1.19b and 1.19c. These
spatial graphs form a series from mutually nearest neighbours with few edges per node
(averaging 0.62), through the Minimum Spanning Tree (about 2.0) to the Delaunay tri-
angulation with many (about 6.0); each graph in the series is a subgraph of the graph that
follows (see Chapter 9). A spatio-temporal hierarchy can be more complicated, includ-
ing only temporal neighbours (history explains it all), only spatial neighbours (location
is everything), or some of both (Figure 1.20), with the critical question being the spa-
tial and temporal distances at which neighbours have an inﬂuence. Similar hierarchies
of inclusive subgraphs can be created in aspatial and atemporal applications, such as
trophic networks, by using different threshold values for including the directed edges
based on their transfer rates or feeding preferences: each change in threshold having the
potential to produce a different graph that includes all the edges of the previous version.
In all cases, the hierarchy allows a hierarchical series of hypothesis tests, admittedly not
independent, that will permit an evaluation of ecologically interesting hypotheses.
One major goal of this book is to help ecologists understand the wide array of “smart
things” that can be done with graph theory, providing some guidance on the range of

approaches to evaluating hypotheses that graph theory affords. That range is broad and
deep.
1.7
Statistical Tests and Hypothesis Evaluation
When ecological hypotheses are translated into statistical hypotheses, we need the
appropriate statistics and test procedures to assess signiﬁcance. The general approach
is to compare a statistic calculated from the data to the appropriate reference distribu-
tion. When the reference distribution is known and tabulated, parametric tests may be
used, but these signiﬁcance procedures require independence of the data. When the ref-
erence distribution is not known, but the characteristics of interest can be studied by
the enumeration of graph structures, enumeration can be used to provide the frequency
distributions upon which tests can be based. If parametric methods are not available,
and enumeration is not an option, then randomization procedures are a good alternative
to generate a reference distribution from the data (Edgington 1995; Manly 2006). When
inference to the population level is required, bootstrap procedures and Monte Carlo sim-
ulations can be used (Efron & Tibshirani 1993; Manly 2006). Randomization tests are
an attractive approach because signiﬁcance is evaluated by comparison with empirical
distributions generated from the data, which is especially appealing for small data sets
that do not meet the assumptions of parametric tests.
1.7.1
Parametric Tests
Parametric tests may be available only rarely for the applications described here, partic-
ularly as any source of lack of independence, and there may be several, invalidate the
05:35:16

1 Graphs as Structure in the Ecological Context
application of these familiar test procedures, but a common comparison for observed
properties is the same characteristic in random graphs (Erdös & Rényi 1960). Their
simple model for random graphs is to start with n nodes and to include any one of all
possible edges independently and with constant probability p. Under those conditions, a
number of characteristics follow binomial, Poisson or (approximately or asymptotically)
Normal distributions. For example, the degree of any vertex follows a binomial distribu-
tion, and the distribution of the number of vertices of a given degree, d, is asymptotically
Normal (see Barbour et al. 1989). For large graphs, this property enables parametric test-
ing as a good approximation where appropriate. The big question, of course, is when a
random graph of this type is actually a good null hypothesis for comparison.
These Erdös-Rényi random graphs have been well studied since they were introduced,
and much is known about them. For example, threshold values for p and thus for the den-
sity of edges have been determined related to the appearance of certain substructures in
the random graph, such as trees of a given size, cycles of a given size or complete
subgraphs of a given size (Newman 2010). This knowledge can also be useful for eval-
uating the subgraph characteristics of an observed graph. It is because the edges in
these random graphs are placed independently and with constant probability that many
distributions derived from them can be assumed to converge to known parametric dis-
tributions.
1.7.2
Enumeration and Probability Calculations
Enumeration is a straightforward way to determine whether the observed structural char-
acteristics that are related to a hypothesis of ecological interest are surprising, in the
sense of being signiﬁcantly different from what would be expected for “randomly cho-
sen” graphs of the same kind. Rather than really using randomly chosen or randomly
constructed graphs, it may be possible to compare an observed structure with all possi-
ble graphs in the domain of interest. For example, we might want to know how unusual
it would be or it would be for a bifurcating tree, like a cladogram, to have exactly one
branch node of each possible order from 1 to n −1. We could generate all possible trees
of that kind and determine directly how many have that property. While this approach
may sound “labour-intensive,” computing power now makes it easy. An alternative in
some circumstances is to calculate the probability of a given characteristic, such as the
cladogram example just given, from something like ﬁrst principles, hoping that we have
got those ﬁrst principles right (!). The advantage of the “brute force” enumeration of
all possible structures is that limits can be placed on the structures considered. We can
therefore enumerate within subsets deﬁned by particular characteristics, allowing us to
circumvent, or at least understand, the effects of the lack of independence in how the
structures are put together.
For example, consider studying competition in a community of n species by a large
complete experiment that tests the competitive outcome of every pairwise combination.
For each pair of species, one is determined to be the “winner,” based on some crite-
rion evaluating performance. The structure that results from all pairwise tests is called a
tournament for obvious reasons, and can be represented by a directed graph of n nodes

and n −1 directed edges pointing from “winner” to “loser.” One way to examine the
consistency of competitive outcomes is to evaluate the transitivity of the digraph. A
relationship like competitive dominance is said to be transitive whenever, given edges
A–B and B–C, we also ﬁnd A–C. To evaluate the competition results, we determine the
frequency of transitive triangles in the graph, compared with the frequency of “paradox-
ical” triangles that show cycles of competitive outcome or a kind of competitive reversal
where we ﬁnd A–B and B–C, but also C–A. If the tournament is almost completely tran-
sitive, we can work through enumeration and some probability calculations to determine
how expected or unexpected that outcome might be, given all possible tournaments and
an assumption of equal probabilities for all.
There are n(n −1)/2 positions for edges among the n nodes, and each takes one of two
possible directions, A–B or B–A, independently (that’s important!) of the others, and so
there are 2n(n −1)/2 tournaments. If the competitive outcomes are consistently transitive
throughout the tournament, then there is a strict order of all n species from the strongest
competitor to the weakest. There are exactly n! of these orderings, since all orders of
the n species are possible, and may be considered equally probable. The best competitor
outcompetes all others, and so it has an out-degree (or “score”) of n −1, the next best a
score of n −2, and so on, down to 0 for the weakest competitor (Figure 1.21).
For example, the tournament in Figure 1.21, n = 5, and the scores are 4, 2, 2, 2, 0.
While not completely transitive, the competitive relationships among the species are
quite consistent in their transitivity. This example will be discussed further in Chapter
6, but it shows something of the procedure to evaluate the graph-based results.
1.7.3
Other Random Graph Constructions
The Erdös-Rényi model for random graph construction is, of course, not the only model.
The literature describes many others, of which the Watts-Strogatz “small world” is one
of the most often cited, as is the “scale-free” network model (Newman 2010). One char-
acteristic frequently used to differentiate among these models is the distribution of the

nodes’ degrees; for the small world model, this follows a delta distribution, which is
bell shaped but sharply peaked; for the scale-free models, it is a power function (Albert
& Barabási 2002, among many others). Several other measures are used to character-
ize graphs to determine the most likely descriptive model; these include average path
length, clustering coefﬁcient, and correlation of node degrees (Albert & Barabási 2002,
among many). The clustering coefﬁcient is essentially the probability that two neigh-
bours of a given node (say j and k which have edges to node i) are themselves neighbours
(joined by ejk). One measure associated with the correlation among node degrees is the
joint degree distribution; this edge-based statistic tabulates the bivariate distribution of
the degrees of nodes joined by an edge; it can be calculated directly from the adjacency
matrix (Newman 2010). It tells more about connectivity than the degree distribution
because it shows whether the degrees of neighbouring nodes are positively or negatively
autocorrelated. The frequency is often converted into a Pearson correlation measure that
runs between −1 and +1, designated r, called the assortativity coefﬁcient because it dis-
tinguishes between assortative networks with r > 0 in which high degree nodes tend to
be ﬁrst-order neighbours (path length 1) of other high degree nodes (giving positive
autocorrelation) and disassortative networks with r < 0 in which high degree nodes
tend to be ﬁrst-order neighbours of low degree nodes (giving negative autocorrelation).
Of course, characteristics other than node degree can be used as the basis for assortative
versus disassortative designations for network graphs (Newman 2010, Section 7.13).
The many random models for graphs and networks may be tailored to the circum-
stances. As with randomization of existing structures, creating random models for com-
parison with the observed data allow us to include constraints on the random version
that reﬂect constraints in the system being studied. For example, in a study of poten-
tial migrations between landscape patches, we might be interested in the diameter of
the Minimum Spanning Tree as a measure of the shortest distances and fewest “steps”
between patches. In that case, it would be reasonable to create a large number of realiza-
tions of randomly placed nodes of a spatial graph within an equivalent area, determine
the Minimum Spanning Tree for each, and thus determine a frequency distribution for
the diameter. This frequency distribution can then be used to evaluate the observed
value.

Randomization and Restricted Randomization
Randomization tests are based on the hypothesis that all re-arrangements by re-ordering
or pairwise exchanges (“shufﬂing”) of the data are equally likely. Therefore, although
randomization tests may have fewer assumptions than other forms of testing, there are
still some to consider. In addition, large numbers of randomizations (e.g. 10,000) may
be necessary to achieve the desired level of signiﬁcance for a particular test. Random-
ization tests do not offer fully the familiar security of parametric statistics, but their
ﬂexibility provides the means to analyze complex ecological data using experimen-
tal or sampling designs for which classical tests have not been developed. Ecologists
can also develop their own statistics, opening up the possibility of testing in novel
situations.

1.7 Statistical Tests and Hypothesis Evaluation
33
Any lack of independence in data (due to time, space, behaviour, relatedness, phy-
logeny, . . . ) can impair the application of either parametric or randomization tests. Para-
metric tests require that the errors are independent, so that each observation or data point
brings a full degree of freedom. If the lack of independence is due to spatial relation-
ships, the resulting positive spatial dependence usually makes nearby sampling units
more alike and so a spatially autocorrelated sample does not bring a full degree of free-
dom, but rather a fraction of it, inversely proportional to the autocorrelation in the data
(Legendre 1993; Dale & Fortin 2009). Several techniques in sampling design and in sta-
tistical analysis (Legendre & Legendre 2012; Dale & Fortin 2009) can correct or control
for dependence in the data, so that familiar parametric tests can be used with minor mod-
iﬁcation. This issue of non-independent errors is at the core of the analysis of ecological
data but it applies to the development of randomization procedures for dependent data,
complete randomness is not really an appropriate comparator and so forms of random-
ness which incorporate some degree of structure (often spatial or temporal) should be
used (Cressie 1993). These are restricted randomization procedures that include some
of the structure of dependency already in the data (Fortin & Payette 2002; Manly 2006),
or at least most of it (see Dale & Fortin 2014, Figures 8.12 and 8.13). There are sev-
eral different ways to restrict the randomization on a graph depending on the system.
A simple example would be a map of diseased and healthy plants, with a network of
neighbours imposed upon it. A simple question is whether the diseased plants are clus-
tered or overdispersed, and it is one that is easily answered, but a more useful question
might be whether the diseased plants are clustered or overdispersed given the overall
arrangement of the plants of either kind.
1.7.5
Random Walks on Graphs
A specialized form of randomization for investigating graph properties is the application
of random walks on graphs, closely related to the study of Markov models. What is
random here is not the graph itself or its formation, but a walk, a sequence of alternating
nodes and edges, on the existing graph. The basic random walk begins with a single
randomly chosen node (step 0), and then moves with equal probability to any of the
adjacent nodes by the edge that joins them (step 1). The number of possible next steps
is the degree of the current node, di, and the probability for any one of them being
next is di−1. The process is then iterated many times, as illustrated in Figure 1.22, and
in general, the relative frequencies of the nodes in a long random walk approaches a
stable distribution determined by the graph’s structure. Many properties of these walks
have been investigated and they provide important insights into how graphs work. More
speciﬁcs on random walks on graphs will be discussed in Chapter 9, related to spatial
graphs and the implications for conservation ecology in fragmented landscapes.
1.7.6
Models
An obvious extension for understanding ecological systems using graphs is the devel-
opment and evaluation of models. It is an easy step to go from restricted randomizations

for generating the distributions of variables, to Monte Carlo models where new “data
sets” are generated with known characteristics and built-in forms of dependence. This is
closely related to the approach that provided an understanding of random graphs versus
small world graphs versus scale-free graphs; but there, the graphs themselves were gen-
erated by random processes, rather than the “data” on which graphs are subsequently
based. The latter version can be useful for much more highly speciﬁed circumstances.
For example, in models of spatio-temporal bipartite graphs studying plant-pollinator
relationships, the creation of “random” edges needs to be limited by the phenologies of
both plant ﬂowering and pollinator activity; and to avoid adding in “forbidden links”
(Olesen et al. 2008; Jordano 1987), pollination interactions that cannot occur, such as
the combination of a long-tubed ﬂower and a pollinator with short mouthparts. Mod-
els can also help in dealing with the complexity of large-scale many-factor systems by
integrating pattern and process (e.g. Peterson et al. 2013) or by modelling spatial deci-
sions for resource exploitation by simulation and evaluation (Walker et al. 2013). More
examples of the use of a range of model types will arise in the following chapters, but
this is another area of applying graph theory in ecological studies that deserves more
emphasis and exploration.
1.7.7
Sampling and Inference
Many of the ecological systems of great interest involve very large numbers of individ-
uals or of taxa or of observations, producing graphs of networks that have many nodes
and many edges. Very large graphs present serious challenges for data collection, data

analysis, and inference (see e.g. Ahmed et al. 2014). One obvious solution is to choose
a sample of the entire graph or network and use the information from the sample to
make inferences about the whole, whether the questions of interest are about the sys-
tem’s topology and structure or about its function and dynamics (Leskovec & Faloutsos
2006; Maiya 2011). There are many different ways of selecting the sample, but a sim-
ple approach is to take a random subset of the nodes of the graph and to include all
edges between pairs of those nodes, giving an “induced subgraph sample” (Kolaczyk
2009). Samples can be based on nodes, as in this case, or on randomly chosen edges,
or on a node’s edges or its neighbour clusters (“star” and “snowball” sampling) with
many variations (Lee et al. 2006). Such a sample can be the basis for estimates of sev-
eral characteristics of the whole graph: average node degree, betweenness centrality, the
clustering coefﬁcient or graph transitivity, and so on (for details, see Lee et al. 2006;
Kolaczyk 2009, Chapter 5; Ahmed et al. 2014). Most ecologists are familiar with the
effect of spatial autocorrelation on the analysis of locational data (see Legendre 1993;
Dale & Fortin 2009); similar effects are to be expected within the “graph space” of
network graphs, due to the positive autocorrelation called “homophily” or “assortative-
ness” or the negative form called “heterophily” or “disassortativeness,” but much of
the emphasis in network graph sampling is on estimation rather than on signiﬁcance
levels.
1.8
Concluding Comments
The purpose of this chapter was to introduce the most important concepts of graph
theory as they can be applied in ecological studies, without duplicating the formality of
standard graph theory texts. A second criterion was not to include everything that would
be needed throughout the book. That would seem overwhelming. More objects and
properties will be introduced throughout the chapters that follow as they are required.
Some themes and concepts are included more than once throughout the book; the rep-
etition is intentional because the reader is not expected to work through the material
cover to cover and in the order imposed by the chapters.
The basic message for the reader from the material of Chapter 1 on applying graph
theory to their own ecological research is “You can do this . . . ” The chapters that follow
provide the next important level, showing some of the details of “ . . . and here’s how.”
Many of the investigations that we may wish to pursue can be improved or facilitated by
the application of graph theory, and there are many which would be impossible without
graph theory to develop and test the hypotheses of interest.
I do not apologize for the lack of “real” examples for some of the suggested applica-
tions. The whole point is that these are things that can be done, but many have not. We
should not wait for others to complete their studies and present us with their mature and
considered results before following up on these promising approaches. In some cases,
there have been applications in other ﬁelds of endeavour that are sufﬁciently similar
to act as models for ecological applications to follow. There is a long and varied (and
enticing) list of ideas for us to explore!

1 Graphs as Structure in the Ecological Context
That’s it for the introduction! There is lots to learn, but worth the effort. The long list
of the subjects of ecological studies is matched by a long list of the ways in which graph
theory can be employed to support and facilitate, or even to direct those studies, and that
is the focus of the rest of this volume. The next chapter is designed to complement this
chapter’s introductory material by reviewing the range that graph theory covers from a
different angle: the shapes of graphs, from trees to triangles.

Shapes of Graphs: Trees to Triangles
Introduction
This chapter is designed to help “unpack” many of the concepts introduced in Chapter 1,
with a more in-depth treatment and some pre-ﬁguring of material that will be covered in
more detail by later chapters. Complementary presentations should ease the intense list
of concepts and details, and help with getting into the mode of “thinking with graphs.”
The main topic is a quick tour through a range of different shapes or topologies for
graphs and some of the variations on these basic forms that are helpful in ecological
applications.
One theme is how seemingly small changes in the rules that control how graphs are
created have large effects on the graph that results. For example, what happens if graphs
are not allowed to have cycles in their structure? What is the effect of having directions
to the edges? If the edges occur at random positions, how many triangles should the
graph have? There are good reasons for starting with the ﬁrst question and considering
the consequences of “acyclic” graphs.
2.1
Acyclic Graphs
A graph with undirected edges and no cycles (i.e. no paths that form closed loops) is
a “tree” when it is connected, and (of course) “a forest” when it is not (Figure 2.1).
Trees are common structural forms in almost all branches of science (pun intended),
from hydrocarbon molecules and river basin drainage networks to evolutionary diver-
siﬁcation, to data storage and retrieval and to modelling clonal growth (see Box 2.1).
Compared with graphs of interaction networks, these are simple structures with simple
rules for associated functions, but they are both useful and powerful for applications in
the ecological context.
Considering trees as spatial structures, one feature is that while there is always a
path through the tree between any two nodes, there is only one path, with no detours or
alternative routes between nodes. This fact has implications for tree-shaped structures
in a natural setting based on their vulnerability to disconnection or disruption.
In ecology, as in other ﬁelds, classiﬁcation is one way of organizing multivariate data
sets; for example, using species abundance data to group quadrats into a hierarchy of
clusters based on similarity. When the objects or clusters are joined two at a time, the

clustering process can be depicted as a dendrogram, which is a binary tree (Figure 2.2).
It is often of interest to ecologists (1) to evaluate the shape of the dendrograms and (2) to
determine the similarity of two dendrograms. Graph theory can be helpful in providing
guidance to both these evaluations.
Dendrograms are rooted trees (see Box 2.2), with the “root” node representing the
grouping of all objects (a node of degree one), “leaf” nodes that represent the original n
objects (nodes of degree one), and n −1 “branch” nodes of degree three, that represent
where the groups are joined (Figure 2.3).
2.1.1
Shape
The “shape” of a dendrogram can be deﬁned in different ways, but one difﬁculty is the
fact that, for a single data set, the dendrograms that result from clustering can be very
Box 2.1 Trees
A tree is a connected undirected graph with no cycles. Trees can be used in ecol-
ogy to provide a spatial framework for locations (e.g. Minimum Spanning Tree or
radial spanning tree), to model the growth of branching organisms (e.g. trees [of
course!], corals or clonal herbs and grasses) and to describe the evolutionary history
of related organisms (a phylogenetic tree). Trees are also fundamental as data and
computational structures, important to ecologists as well through the analyses they
do! In some cases, one node is designated as the “root” of the tree; this gives an
implicit directionality to the structure.

different, depending on the similarity measure and clustering algorithm on which the
dendrogram is based. This fact needs to be considered in interpreting the results. One
description of shape is the frequency distribution of the sizes of the subtrees (the number
of leaf nodes) at each branch node: mk is the number of branch nodes with k + 1 leaf
nodes (Dale & Moon 1988). In the example in Figure 2.3, there are three groups of two
objects, one of three and one of four. The subtree shape is M = (m1, m2, . . . , mn −1); in
Figure 2.3, M = (3, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1).
Another shape characteristic is the number of “terminal singles,” single objects that
are joined to the all-inclusive group only at the very end of the clustering process (Dale
& Moon 1988). In Figure 2.3, the dendrogram has no terminal singles; in Figure 2.4,
there are four in the ﬁrst example, and two in the second. Terminal singles are interesting
Box 2.2 Dendrograms
Dendrograms are trees. They are binary rooted trees, used to depict and analyze
the results of classiﬁcation procedures or cluster analysis; n objects classiﬁed pro-
duce a dendrogram of n leaf nodes and n −1 branch nodes. The branch nodes may
be located in the diagram at the similarity level of the join represented, or may be
ordered by the size of the subtree. The shape of dendrograms can be characterized
by the frequency distribution of the numbers of subtrees of a given size (mk subtrees
with k leaf nodes) and by the number of “terminal singles” which are leaf nodes
that are joined as singletons at the end of the process. Of course, by some mea-
sures, all dendrograms are the same “shape” for any given n, with the same number
of leaf nodes, branch nodes and edges. Dendrograms’ shapes can be compared to
determine similarity based on probability calculations or on more recently devel-
oped approaches that use graph kernels.

because they represent species or sites that are not closely related to any group and
should be more common in data that are not strongly structured into sub-groupings of
the objects. Calculating the frequency distribution of the number of terminal singles, S,
provides the expected values, and S is signiﬁcantly larger than expected if S > 1 for n
> 10, and (surprisingly) if S > 0 once n is greater than 40. That means that, for larger
values of n, terminal singles should be very rare.

2.1.2
Comparison
To compare two dendrograms of the same objects based on similar or different data,
there are several methods, but the general approach was developed in the early 1960s
(Sokal & Rohlf 1962), which uses the correlation of the values of the joins of the same
pair of objects in the two classiﬁcations. One variant of this method is to use the correla-
tion of the subtree sizes in which the pair of objects ﬁrst occur together. The signiﬁcance
of the outcome can be determined by a simple randomization procedure that maintains
the overall structures but re-labels the leaf nodes at random.
A more recent approach is to compare two dendrograms by a technique based on “ker-
nels” or kernel functions, which was developed for trees in general. Kernels are math-
ematical functions used extensively in pattern analysis and machine learning (Shawe-
Taylor & Cristianini 2004). A kernel is a function of two mathematical objects (like two
graphs) that measures their similarity, based on an inner product or on a direct product
of the two objects to map them into a more usable space (Shervashidze et al. 2011).
Chapter 9 of this book describes one such kernel method for determining similarity that
is based on random walks on the graphs. Imagine comparing a set of random walks (as
described in Chapter 1) on dendrogram 1 with a set of random walks on dendrogram 2,
more similar graphs will have more similar sets of walks. Interestingly, Oh et al. (2006)
used the kernel approach in determining phylogenetic trees based on metabolic networks
to quantify similarity from the original data and based their classiﬁcation on those val-
ues. This approach has also been used in the analysis of natural languages (Moschitti
2006; Sun et al. 2011) and to compare characteristics of phylogenies of RNA viruses
(Poon et al. 2013). In those phylogenetic trees, the patterns discerned in the analysis
seemed to reﬂect modes of transmission and pathogenesis, and the authors concluded
that the kernel approach represents an important new tool for characterizing evolution
and epidemiology of viruses (Poon et al. 2013). That paper provides the information
needed to apply this technique to comparing trees from ecological data, for example in
studies related to functional diversity (see Petchey & Gaston 2002; Poos et al. 2009) and
it seems like a smart thing to try!
2.2
Digraphs and Directed Acyclic Graphs
The next change in the rules of graph construction to be considered is allowing the
edges to have directions, giving digraphs (Box 2.3) and other directed structures.
With digraphs, some of the familiar concepts needed adjusting. For example, a non-
directed graph is connected when there is a path between any two nodes. In a digraph,
if there is a (directed) path between any two nodes, it is strongly connected; if there
are only semi-paths between some nodes with paths between all others, it is weakly
connected. (The tree in Figure 2.5 is weakly connected because there are only semi-
paths to the root node.) The other adjustment is in the possible existence of an edge in
each direction between a pair of nodes, which is easy to see for symmetric interactions
like associations, but it can apply to asymmetric interactions too. There can be edges
.003
15:25:04

2 Shapes of Graphs: Trees to Triangles
Box 2.3 Digraphs
Digraphs have edges that have direction, and any pair of nodes can have two edges
between them: A to B as well as B to A. Properly, a cycle in a digraph is a directed
cycle: that is a directed path from a node back to itself following the directions of
the arrows on the edges. Not following the edge directions yields a semi-path and
thus a semi-cycle. Digraphs have obvious applications for asymmetric relationships,
such as the inﬂuence of one organism on another (whether positive or negative),
but they can also be used to signal reciprocal relationships explicitly in contrast
to unidirectional affects. Predation, competition, facilitation and other asymmetric
interactions are portrayed by digraphs, but so are systems with physical routes for
movement, ﬂow or transportation; in those digraphs the edges often have weights to
indicate capacity, rates or distances.
representing predation between the nodes representing species; consider the situation in
which large ﬁsh of species A eat small ﬁsh of species B and large ﬁsh of species B eat
small ﬁsh of species A. Schematically:
A ↔B because A ←B and A →B.
A system that has directionality and directed edges and no cycles combines some of
the features of trees with those of digraphs. A directed acyclic graph (DAG, see Box
2.4) is a digraph that contains no directed cycles but may have semi-cycles (Harary
1969) (i.e. which would be cycles if the direction did not count); this is, its underlying
graph may not be a tree and may have non-directed cycles (cf. Newman 2010, Section
6.4.2). Figure 2.5 shows a directed rooted tree, sometimes called an arborescence, and
a directional acyclic graph. In the directed tree, there is exactly one directed path from
the root to any other node, and at most one directed path between any two nodes; in the
acyclic digraph, there can be several. Every arborescence is a directed acyclic graph but
root

underlying graph (undirected version) has no cycles. (right) A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is
similar, but its underlying graph has cycles. Both are partial orders.

15:25:04

2.2 Digraphs and Directed Acyclic Graphs
43
Box 2.4 Directed Acyclic Graphs
These DAGs are digraphs that have no directed cycles, and so are acyclic like trees.
Unlike trees, however, they can have more than one path between any two nodes, but
not all pairs of nodes will have a path between them. Their chief applications are
in causal and data structures, but their ecological application can include the spatial
context for physical paths like braided streams, anastomosing hyphal systems, or the
trails or movements of animals (like transportation systems).
not every acyclic graph is an arborescence. Any directed acyclic graph has at least one
source node of in-degree 0, and at least one sink node of out-degree 0.
Obvious examples of directed acyclic graphs are deltas and braided streams in hydro-
logical systems, or the anastomosing networks of fungal colonies. These may have mul-
tiple paths between nodes, not just one as in a tree, but they can also have more than one
source and more than one sink. Figure 2.6 shows a system of braided trails that form a
graph with cycles (top), but the migration of a herd along those trails form an acyclic
digraph (Figure 2.6a, bottom). The acyclic digraph does not need to be a connected
graph (Figure 2.6b). Directed trees and acyclic digraphs arise naturally in many applica-
tions, including causal structures in epidemiology (Greenland et al. 1999); genealogical,
phylogenetic, and recombinant networks (e.g. Strimmer & Moulton 2000); and search
and topological ordering algorithms in computer science (Cormen et al. 2009). They
are also key structures in the study of correlation, causality and the development of
structural models (Mitchell 1992; Shipley 2000, 2009; Pearl 2009). In a rooted tree, the
structure creates a “partial ordering” (see Box 2.5) of the nodes determined by (path)
distance from the root (see Figure 2.7); similarly, DAGs give partial order to the nodes
(Figure 2.6b).
As remarked, trees are also a standard format for data storage and retrieval, with a
number of different techniques for organizing and ﬁnding information. A distinguish-
ing feature for examining any of these trees is whether the nodes represent the same
or different things. In a Minimum Spanning Tree, which provides a skeleton that joins
spatially located nodes, the nodes are all the same (e.g. locations of individual organ-
isms); but in a dendrogram, the leaf nodes and the branch nodes represent different
things (e.g. individual units vs joins forming groupings of such units), and thus have
different roles. The difference between the roles is reﬂected in their graph theory prop-
erties; for example, leaf nodes have degree 1 and branch nodes have degree 3 (or more).
In digraphs, generally, and in DAGs, each node has both an in-degree (upstream neigh-
bours) and out-degree (downstream neighbours). Some nodes will have only outgoing
edges (sources) and some will have only incoming edges (sinks). In the functioning of
the ecological system depicted by a digraph, sources and sinks obviously have different
roles, and for intermediate nodes, the ratio or difference between in-degree and out-
degree is expected to indicate role differentiation. Further on in the discussion of graph
properties and system function, the topic of what can be understood about function

Box 2.5 Partial order
A partial ordered set is one in which there is a pairwise relationship of some kind,
say precedence, where the relationship is indicated for some pairs of elements in
the set but not all. A familiar example would be the subsets of a given set with
the relationship of inclusion: {a,b,c} includes both {a,b} and {b,c}, but there is no
inclusion relationship between {a,b} and {b,c} because {a,b} does not contain {b,c}
and {b,c} does not contain and {a,b}. Hence the relationship gives only a partial
order. For a DAG, the relationship indicated by the directed edge gives a partial order,
which is the relationship of a node to its downstream neighbours. A directed cycle for
that upstream-to-downstream relationship would seem paradoxical; it would indicate
A →B and B →C, but C →A, which seems to reverse the direction of the ﬁrst

in greater generality and in more detail.

Weighted Directed Trees
Graphs can have weights associated either with the nodes or with the edges (or both).
The analysis of data from streams and rivers, referred to as “dendritic” spatial networks,
gives good examples of weighted directed trees and their usefulness in ecological studies

In a comparison of the determinants of juvenile Coho salmon densities, Flitcroft et al.
(2012) used individual pools in a stream network as the nodes, with weights being the
counts of the ﬁsh in them. Position in the network was determined by variables such as
stream “order” (ﬁrst-order streams have no tributaries, second order have only ﬁrst-order
tributaries and so on). The pools were characterized both by habitat variables, such as
depth and boulders, and by “connectivity” measures of proximity to spawning habitat,
winter rearing habitat and summer habitat. Their ﬁnding was that the network variables
were better predictors of juvenile Coho numbers than the traditional habitat measures.
In a more methodological work, Ganio et al. (2005) used counts of cutthroat trout as the
nodes of trees representing stream networks to illustrate calculating variograms (Dale
& Fortin 2014) in dendritic systems, as an approach to spatial pattern analysis.
The directionality in drainage networks is not only in the physical ﬂow of the water,
but also in the fact that downstream water bodies tend to have greater volume, poten-
tially confounding position in the network with habitat “patch size” as factors deter-
mining species diversity. Carrara et al. (2014) used an experimental system of aquatic
microcosms linked in different landscape structures (“riverine,” “random” and “homo-
geneous”) populated by protist species to separate these two effects on diversity. The
tree nodes were the microcosms and their weights were their volume and their diversity.
Graph characteristics of the nodes were their degree and their distance from the outlet
(much like stream order or distance from the root). Patch size, node degree and distance
to outlet were all found to affect α-diversity, but there was considerable dependence
on the spatial covariance of the three in the riverine structures that most closely mimic
natural stream networks.
The last example is also from a dendritic system, with data from the Maryland Bio-
logical Stream Survey (Ver Hoef et al. 2006) and with the nodes being stream junc-
tions or delimiters of stream segments and the edges are the segments themselves. Here
the weights, which are sulphate concentration, are known only for some of the edges,
and the challenge was to model the variable for the entire system. This was achieved
using spatial covariance models incorporating both ﬂow and stream distance, leading
to an ability to adapt many of the usual models for Euclidean distance for the tree
structures.

Lattice Graphs
Some graphs can be drawn as regular geometric structures in two dimensions and are
referred to as lattice graphs (Box 2.6). As one example, given a spatial grid of com-
munity composition data, cluster analysis can be used to create groupings of similar
locations, which can then be mapped onto the grid. Often, constrained clustering will
be used, so that only adjacent sites or groups of sites are joined at each stage of the pro-
cess. Because this creates a lattice graph embedded in space, it is the same as spatially
constrained cluster analysis.
As a speciﬁc application, consider a square lattice of nodes in a plane with edges join-
ing only adjacent row and column neighbours (the “rook’s move” deﬁnition). The edges

Box 2.6 Lattice Graphs
These are graphs that can be drawn as a lattice in two dimensions: usually square,
but possibly triangular or hexagonal. The edges then form a tiling of the plane, with
all the tiles being the same shape, and all the nodes (except those on the boundary)
having the same degree. Another view is that a lattice graph is made up of regular
repetitions of the same small cycle. The lattice is most often regular but variations
of irregular “lattices” are certainly possible, for example when based on geographic
regions or political boundaries (see Box 2.7). In ecology, the main application of
lattice graphs is for raster or grid data, such as surveys on square grid; each node
that is not on a boundary of the lattice has degree 4, being contiguous with four other
grid cells as neighbours. In a regular triangular lattice, each node has six neighbours.
(In a hexagonal lattice, each has degree 3.)
are of two kinds: open edges allow transmission between the nodes, and closed edges
do not. The question of interest is that of “percolation”: if any given edge is open with
probability q (and closed with probability 1 −q), what values of q guarantee that there is
(or is not) an open path from one side of the lattice to the other (Figure 2.9). The analogy
in ecological applications would be the spread of disease through a population, such as
a large plantation of trees (the nodes), based on the probability or rate of transmission
between immediate neighbours. The phenomenon of percolation and its mathematics
have been well studied and there are many known results available to ecologists who
might apply this model to the spread of ﬁre through a forested landscape or disease
through a plantation. For example, the behaviour of transmission changes rapidly from
very restricted to very prevalent near a critical threshold probability, qc. For a square
lattice, that value is 0.50. For natural populations, the square lattice may not be a good

model, and the value may be lower, such as 0.37 for a triangular lattice, which might be
a better approximation for deﬁning spatial neighbours (Figure 1.20c). Just as a review
of percolation can be based on the ability of edges to allow passage, called bond per-
colation, it can also be approached with nodes that are either open or closed, called
“site percolation” (Figure 2.10). Despite all that has been discovered about percolation
on regular lattices, simulations with random graphs based on different neighbour rules
may provide the best comparisons for percolation results in ecological applications, for
which the underlying structure is often irregular.
In three dimensions, a rectangular lattice graph is essentially cubic, and each node
has six neighbours. Such a lattice graph ﬁts with the use of voxels (3D volume cells,
cf. “pixel”) for the analysis of remote sensing data (e.g. Wang et al. 2008; Bienert et al.
2010), and there are useful examples for comparison from medical ﬁelds from which we
ecologists might learn, for example brain structure and connectivity (see Loewe et al.
2014 for an application in neuroscience that combines voxels with a graph-theoretical
analysis of connectivity).
Box 2.7 Triangulation
A triangulation is a planar graph in which the edges create a tiling of the plane
made up of contiguous triangles. This creates a graph very similar to a lattice graph,
but not a regular lattice, that is useful for spatial analysis (e.g. epidemiological data
are often tabulated by township or county, producing irregular structures). A graph
such as that in Figure 1.20c is essentially an irregular version of a triangular lattice
graph and one way in which it is irregular is that not all the nodes have the same
degree.

are allowed.
2.5
Triangles
Triangles are critical components of graphs, and have many uses and interpretations,
mainly as subgraphs (it’s all about subgraphs!). For example, they are the smallest cyclic
structures in most graphs (although some digraphs may allow reciprocal edges on two
nodes), they are used in measures of local edge density, and they are the basic unit of
space-ﬁlling spatial “tilings,” which are mosaics of contiguous polygons that cover the
whole plane.
As with the regular lattice graph, triangulations can be used as the basis for a spatially
constrained cluster analysis of compositional or other spatially referenced data. Some
authors include them in discussions of lattice processes, even when they are irregular
(Cressie & Wikle 2011, Figure 4.9). As mentioned above, they also provide the under-
lying structure on which to study percolation phenomena in natural systems.
One way to study the properties of graphs is to consider a null model of how a graph
might form if the edges are placed between randomly chosen pairs of nodes (the Erdös-
Rényi null model). For triangles, consider the question of how many there may be in one
of these random graphs, which have undirected edges that occur independently between
any pair of nodes with a constant probability, p. Connectance refers to the proportion
of possible edge positions that are actually ﬁlled, and that should be close to the value
of p in the Erdös-Rényi model. Triangles are fundamental to the measure called the
clustering coefﬁcient; it is the rate of “triad completion,” the proportion of triplets of
node with two edges that have the third edge as well. In a random graph based on the
E-R model, what is the probability that three nodes have all three edges? It’s p3. What
is the probability that three nodes have only two edges? It’s 3p2(1 −p).
For digraphs, triplets of nodes with three directed edges can have cyclic or noncyclic
(transitive) structure as already mentioned. In some cases, it is possible for two of the
three edges to join the same pair of nodes with reciprocal directions (Figure 2.11).

2 are balanced
2 are not balanced
Figure 2.12 Triangles with signed edges: two are balanced (even number of negative edges, here 0
and 2) and two are not (odd number of negative edges, here 1 and 3).
For graphs with signed edges (+ and –), a triangle can be “balanced” with none or
two negative edges, or unbalanced, with one or three negative edges (Figure 2.12).
Lastly on triangles: looking at the interactions of three things in a graph (e.g. three
species) as three nodes is the ﬁrst step toward understanding the interactions of more
than three. The third actor added to an interacting pair makes things complicated. Think
of the “three-body problem” from physics (!), in which the addition of a third object
renders the system more sensitive to small differences and less easy to make long-term
predictions of the dynamics (Gleick 1987). In ecology, three-species interactions often
result in unexpected or indirect effects such as apparent competition between prey con-
nected by a shared predator (more on this in Chapter 4).
2.6
Smaller Than Triangles: Singletons, Isolated Pairs and Whiskers
In the discussion of triangles, it was mentioned that in a graph with edges occurring at
random with probability p, the probability that three nodes have all three edges that form
a triangle is p3 in the random edge placement model. The probability that three nodes
have only two edges is 3p2(1 −p), and 3p(1 −p)2 for exactly one edge; for no edges
at all it is (1−p)3. Moving down from triplets of nodes to singles and pairs, consider
the probability of an isolated node, a singleton, which has no edges at all; from standard
probability calculations, that must be (1 −p)(n−1), so the expected number of singletons
is n(1 −p)(n−1).
The probability of two chosen nodes forming an isolated pair (an unattached “tooth-
pick”), following the same reasoning is p[(1 −p)(n–2)]2; the expected number is then
that probability times the number of such pairs, n(n −1)/2. Based on the interest in the
numbers of terminal singles in dendrograms, calculate the probability that any node in
a random graph has degree 1 (a leaf node or a whisker); that is (n −1)p(1 −p)(n−2)

for an arbitrary random graph and so the expected number is n(n −1)p(1 −p)(n−2).
Results are also available for a tree or for a connected graph (Palka 1981). For a random
tree, the expected number of these “pendant vertices” (leaf nodes) is n(1 −1/n)(n−2).
Remember that a tree of n nodes always has n −1 edges, and so p is no longer a factor
in the calculations and a randomly chosen tree is just one of the n(n−2) that are possible
(Palka 1981).
These probabilities can be used for comparison in examining the graphs that result
from ecological studies, although the random edge model is not often expected to be the
most realistic comparator for ecological interpretations. There will be more to say about
small subgraphs in the following chapters, the usefulness of which may not require the
appropriateness of an underlying model.
2.7
How It Looks
The appeal and usefulness of graphs for ecological data are enhanced by the fact that
graphs can be presented visually, which can greatly facilitate our understanding of the
structure and our determination of how to proceed with analysis. What a graph looks
like, however, depends in part on how it is drawn as well as on its actual underlying
structure. The drawing of any graph should show its structure as clearly as possible.
Graphs are typically displayed on a two-dimensional surface, a screen or a piece of
paper, even when they are created as multi-dimensional or projected to give the impres-
sion of a 3D structure. A planar graph is a graph that can be drawn in the plane without
any edges crossing (remember, the edges do not have to be straight; Figure 2.13). With
the exception of some spatial graphs, most graphs in ecological applications are not pla-
nar, but the visual confusion can be reduced by keeping the number of edge crossings

2 Shapes of Graphs: Trees to Triangles
to a minimum. There are no set rules for drawing graphs, but the main goal is clar-
ity and effective use of the elements drawn, focussing on the “data-ink” that conveys
the information. The criteria and principles for graphical excellence in graphs are the
same as those for any other format for conveying quantitative information, and these
have been clearly presented in The Visual Display of Quantitative Information (Tufte
1983). Elegance and effectiveness should be high priorities in how graphs are drawn.
The ratio of data-ink to non-data-ink should be maximized “within reason,” partly by
the erasure of non-data-ink, again within reason (i.e. without sacriﬁcing clarity) (see
Tufte 1983, Chapter 4). Respecting that principle should include positioning the nodes
so that more of the edges can be shorter, especially where the relationship between the
nodes is strongest.
While there are no rules for drawing graphs, there are a number of metrics that can
formalize the criteria introduced above (see Purchase 2002, and references therein).
These are included to various degrees by the many algorithms available to draw graphs
from their matrices (see Di Battista et al. 1994). In addition, there is a range of software
packages that implement those algorithms for graph analysis and display (names that
might be familiar include PAJEK, FoodWeb3D, igraph and Graphviz; see Juenger &
Mutzel 2003; Newton 2010, Table 9.1). A search of the Web will provide up-to-date
choices.
The drawing of a graph should portray its structure as clearly as possible because a
drawing is the only way to present that information; other information can be provided
by other means. For some interaction networks, for example each node and each edge
may have a large amount of quantitative data associated with it. The temptation is to
include much of it in the diagram, to provide as much information as possible all in
one place. That may be a bad idea; too much data, coded or not, can make the drawing
cluttered and detract from the primary purpose of depicting the structure that the graph
represents. Aim for clarity.
2.8
Concluding Comments
To ease into thinking with graphs, it makes sense to start with the simpler forms, from
trees and related structures that have no cycles, to triangles that are the smallest cycles
and lattice graphs that consist of many copies of the same small cycle. These can be
considered in the context of the shapes that graphs can take, but also in the context of
the implications of simple rules governing the nodes and edges. Not only do the simpler
graph forms introduce much of how graphs can be used, but they are also fundamental
structures in the development of graph theory and in its application in the ecological
context. The discussion has also allowed the introduction of some of the themes to be
developed for more complex graphs, such as the importance of directionality and ﬂow,
the information contained in subgraphs, and comparisons of structural details with the
null models of random graphs with simple rules.
Moving onward from the relatively simple topologies of trees and triangles, the next
chapter introduces the potentially very complex graphs of species interaction networks.

2.8 Concluding Comments
53
The simple forms and concepts re-appear in the networks of greater complexity, as do
digraphs and the results of independent edge placement in random graphs. The species
interaction networks are complex in structure and complex in their function and dynam-
ics, but graph theory provides the appropriate (and the only) approach to understanding
both.

Species Interaction Networks
Introduction
Individual organisms interact with many other organisms, both of their own species
and of others, and those interactions are of many different kinds. Textbooks often clas-
sify interactions based on their effects on individual ﬁtness or on population numeri-
cal responses: competition is a (−, −) relationship, predation is (+, −), mutualism is
(+, +) and so on. This classiﬁcation suggests that the interactions are pairwise (although
they are probably more complex) and so graph theory, which is based on pairwise rela-
tionships, is an obvious approach to study these interactions. As ecologists, we can begin
by studying one kind of relationship at a time: the trophic networks that result from pre-
dation, the positive and negative afﬁnity associations among species within a commu-
nity or individuals in a population, competition between functionally similar organisms,
or the nested hierarchies of mutualisms like pollination or of antagonistic relationships
like endoparasitism. It is possible to integrate different interactions “all at once,” but the
increasing complexities suggest that treating the categories separately, at least at ﬁrst,
makes sense. The “sum-of-all-interactions” concept will be discussed in more detail in
Chapter 11, examining the interplay of network topology (the graph properties) and net-
work dynamics (function and change). Whatever individual interaction is investigated,
there are some features that are common to those interaction networks that graphs can
portray, but we can also ask questions about their differences, such as whether there
are network characteristics that are sufﬁciently distinct among interaction networks that
they can be used to tell one kind of network from another.
The ﬁrst and most fundamental assumption is that the structure of the pairwise con-
nections portrayed by a graph can be analyzed and interpreted, with the ﬁndings apply-
ing back to the system itself in a number of ways, including through the dynamics of
interacting populations (May 2006), as studied in network theory. Originally, networks
were considered to be a subset of graphs distinguished by real weights or functions
associated with the edges (see Chapter 1), but currently, the terms are used as equiva-
lents; although graph theory might still be considered to be more general than network
analysis and perhaps more formal. Network analysis is based on graph theory, but also
includes elements of applied probability, statistics and modelling; network theory can
be considered as a specialized branch of more general graph theory.
The second assumption is that the network’s pattern of connections, the topology,
affects the network’s functions (“If you want to understand function, study structure”;

F. H. C. Crick, quoted in Estrada 2012), and how they may change through time (New-
man 2010). Obviously, the network’s structure and function can inﬂuence the evolution
(and coevolution) of the organisms in it (Pascual & Dunne 2006; Bascompte & Jordano
2014), but the structure and function of the network itself can be said to “co-evolve”
(although the use of the same term can be confusing) by reciprocally affected changes.
At any level, whether molecular, cellular or organismal, a system’s form (or structure
or topology) will be affected by the system’s function, just as function is constrained
by form (see Guimerà & Sales-Pardo 2006), as will be discussed further in Chapter 11.
It is the reciprocal interplay of structure and function that makes the understanding of
the structure so important for ecological applications. The third assumption is that some
basic graph-theoretical characteristics (probably few in number) will identify key fea-
tures of these interaction networks. There is virtue in summarizing these networks by
a graph for clarity and visualization, but the important step is to use graph theory for
better understanding. The fourth and last assumption in this list is that structural anal-
ysis and key network features can lead researchers to consider appropriate conceptual
models and algorithms of graph formation (or “evolution”), and “signatures” that can
be seen in those key features. Comparison of graphs observed from inter-speciﬁc inter-
actions with those models will allow researchers to create and test hypotheses about
features of these interactions.
The “interaction network” displays the outcome for a group of species, often with
measures determined by the kind of interaction and the data used to evaluate it (Figure
3.1). In many ecological contexts, motivation includes the decades-long debate on the
relationship between complexity and stability (see Thébault & Fontaine 2010); com-
paring Figure 3.1b with Figure 3.1a, a question is whether more edges or “stronger”
edges somehow increase the stability of the system. The motivation for ecologists also
includes our intense interest in biological diversity and the effects of evolution and

coevolution on that diversity, especially when driven by predation and parasitism, or
pollination and dispersal mutualisms.
For both antagonistic and mutualistic interactions, an important feature is the preva-
lence of reciprocal specialization: for example, how rare is it for a pollinator to special-
ize on a single plant species, which has only the one pollinator. There are well-known
instances, such as Darwin’s prediction of a moth-orchid pairing (Darwin 1862), but is
this a common phenomenon? Joppa et al. (2009) suggested that reciprocal specializa-
tions are not more common than expected from reasonable null models, but actually
rare in a large sample of both antagonistic and mutualistic interaction networks. We can
speculate about the implications of this ﬁnding both for the stability in these networks
and for the coevolution of such species pairs. One graph theory approach to this ques-
tion is to determine the correlation of the degrees of nodes joined by an edge; reciprocal
specialization should give a positive correlation of degrees, produced by low values for
the specialists on either side of the interaction and larger values for the remaining gen-
eralists (Figure 3.2). Nestedness produces the opposite condition with low degree nodes
joined only to high degree nodes, causing low or negative correlation.
Not all the smart things ecologists can do with the data gathered over the years are
based on graph theory, but it has an important contribution to make. The resurgence
in studying ecological networks through graph theory, and the rich data now available
permit a synthesis to be developed based on shared approaches to analysis. There is
growing evidence that it is the distribution of interaction strengths and the conﬁgu-
ration of complexity (that’s the graph theory part) that determine network stability or
resilience, rather than just the number or strength of the interactions (Ings et al. 2008).
The interactions affect evolution and coevolution, and the whole network moderates or
informs those effects (think of the community effects of the “arms race” between key-
stone predators and prey). Of course, many of the interactions are not truly pairwise and

so studies of “two at a time” can be limited in insight. It may be necessary to study
separately the whole expanded network that includes several kinds of relationships,
identiﬁable node-neighbourhoods smaller than the whole graph, or well-deﬁned clus-
ters in the network, always considering that there may be reciprocal changes between
the structure of the interaction network and the organisms in it, or between the network’s
structure and the dynamics it includes. Similar studies and advances in the application
of graph theory are proceeding in other ﬁelds, parallel to those in ecology, including
social networks, information networks, and brain networks (Estrada 2012).
3.1
Objects
Given a set of nodes that represent the species, there are many ways of determining
which pairs are to be joined by edges depicting the interactions. As discussed in Chapter
1, many species interaction studies are based on counts, whether counts of organisms in
sample units, counts of behavioural elements such as ﬂower visitations, or counts of prey
items consumed. This is not universally true, however, and competition outcomes may
be evaluated by measures of such characteristics as individual height, weight, growth
rates, reproductive output and so on. All possible edges could be included together with
a weight for each one reﬂecting the measure of interest, or only a subset of edges,
selected for inclusion based on a quantitative threshold.
3.1.1
Graphs
The basic structure of graphs is determined by the relationships being studied. Some
interactions produce strictly bipartite graphs: pollination and seed dispersal mutualisms,
for example provide a clear division into the plants, which produce the pollen or seeds,
and the animal agents, including insects, bats, birds and so on. This requires nodes to
be in two parts of the graph and the edges run only between and not within (Figure 3.2).
Often, the organisms fall similarly into three clear-cut categories, giving a tri-partite
graph, such as plant–herbivore–carnivore in a simple trophic network, although the
trophic levels in real trophic networks tend to blur somewhat, with omnivores feeding at
more than one level or intra-guild predation occurring within a single level (cf. McCann
2009; Holt 2009). An obvious advantage of graph theory is its ability to deal clearly
with levels thus blurred. The basic structure of single-level communities have differ-
ent complications: there inter-speciﬁc interactions may range from clearly negative like
competition (−, −); to clearly positive, mutualism (+, +); with many variants between:
commensalism (+, 0), amensalism (−, 0), facilitation (+, 0?), inhibition (−, 0?) and
so on. There are also different forms of intra-speciﬁc interactions, such as inter-cohort
competition or juvenile cannibalism. In addition, some critical inter-speciﬁc interactions
are indirect, involving a third species beyond the focal pair and possibly from a different
trophic level; for example, a plant may defend against herbivory by attracting and sup-
porting its herbivores’ predators. Even if the ﬁnal resulting graph ends up as unipartite,
different kinds of edges may be needed to portray accurately the range of interactions.

3 Species Interaction Networks
A bipartite graph has implicit directionality in the edges and the two-part structure
means that some of the usual measures for ordinary graphs, such as average path length
or a measure of node centrality, have less meaning or interest for researchers. Other
characteristics such as compartments and nestedness are important in these bipartite
graphs, but possibly less interesting or not applicable to the situations of many social
networks. A third set of characteristics, such as the distribution of degree nodes or the
bivariate distribution of neighbouring node degrees, are important in most interaction
network graphs whether they are one, two or many layers. The graph characteristics
most of interest will be determined by the ecological questions that motivate the study.
One key characteristic is simply “connectance,” the proportion of possible edge posi-
tions that are occupied, and so an important step in creating the graph of an ecological
system is determining what counts as an interaction in the system, and thus how many
edges there are (see Poisot & Gravel 2014). That determination will, in turn, constrain
the nature of the graph itself, and of the substructures within it.
3.1.2
Subgraphs
One could say “It’s all about subgraphs,” but that would be an exaggeration. Let’s say
“A lot of it is about subgraphs.” The search for clusters in graphs is essentially deﬁning
the best subgraphs according to speciﬁc criteria. Many of the graphs used in ecologi-
cal applications are connected, almost by deﬁnition because all organisms have some
interaction with many other organisms, but not all interactions may appear in a graph of
the system being studied. A graph that is not connected consists of two or more com-
ponents, which are deﬁned as maximally connected subgraphs. The identiﬁcation and
characterization of giant or small components in random graphs identiﬁes subgraphs
(similarly for blocks, cut-points and units of compartmentalization). Figure 3.2a shows
only plant-pollinator interactions, and consists of ﬁve connected subgraphs, which are
not connected to each other. If the plants’ herbivores are included, or the pollinators’
predators, the graph would be connected (Figure 3.2b). Modules and motifs are specially
deﬁned subgraphs, as will be shown, as are the triplets used in determining transitivity
or balance. These are all subgraphs deﬁned by the structure itself.
Other kinds of subgraphs are deﬁned in studying localized properties associated with
neighbourhoods of individual nodes; each node and its ﬁrst-order neighbours deﬁne
the subgraph of interest. Some of the analyses that use graph theory are much like
some forms of spatial analysis, but with space deﬁned in more abstract manner, and
studying the properties of neighbourhoods of individual nodes is exactly parallel to the
use of local, as opposed to global, measures in spatial statistics (Dale & Fortin 2014,
Chapter 6).

Modules, Clusters, Motifs, Triplets, Hubs . . .
For current purposes, “modules” and “clusters” are very similar in concept, being more
or less well deﬁned subgraphs, often with more edges within than between. Sociolo-
gists also use the term “community” for this kind of internal structure, which can be

very confusing for ecologists who use the same term in a different way. These modules
may be of a range of sizes, but their existence gives rise to the concept of “modular-
ity”: a measure of how well the whole graph can be divided into identiﬁable modules
and of how distinct those subgraphs actually are. This is an important feature of food
webs: whether the whole trophic network is one web or whether it can be divided into
functional sub-groupings of more tightly interacting species.
“Motifs” are even more speciﬁcally deﬁned than modules, because a motif is a dis-
tinct arrangement of edges on a small subset of nodes. The usual approach is to use
“triplets” of nodes and to enumerate the observed frequencies of all possible distinct
combinations of directed edges on three nodes. There are 13 such triplets that are con-
nected and those are the ones used, omitting the 3 that are not connected (Milo et al.
2002; Sporns & Kötter 2004; see Figure 3.3a). Examining a graph’s structure by con-
centrating on the relationships among all triplets is another version of the “local statis-
tics” approach. By evaluating and tabulating the structure of these triplet motifs, some
of the larger-scale characteristics of the graph can be formulated, and different graphs
can be structurally compared (e.g. Sporns & Kötter 2004). For example, Paulau et al.
(2015) compared the observed and expected frequency of three-node motifs in node-
ordered digraphs for food webs (the nodes have a strict ordering based on body size),
and showed that including body size to distinguish among non-ordered motif frequen-
cies provides better understanding of the food web structure and function. The appeal
of studying motifs in networks of interactions is that the frequency and nature of these
small subgraphs can provide insights into the dynamics of the functioning network (see
Deshpande et al. 2005; Gollo & Breakspear 2014).
Another network structural feature often cited are “hubs.” A hub is one of very few
nodes with very high degree; such nodes are highly improbable in a purely random
graph, but are to be expected in other models of network formation with preferential
attachment of new edges to high degree nodes. These high degree nodes are common
in some well-studied networks such as the Internet or airline routes (think of a highly
.004

connected airport). Hubs are often also cut-points, nodes whose removal disconnects
big portions of the whole structure, as we well know from experience when an airport
hub is closed by weather. There is clearly a close connection between the positions of
hubs in the structure (and their degree) and the dynamics of the network in which they
function (see Sporns et al. 2007 on hubs in brain networks). For example, Rozenfeld et
al. (2008) used network analysis to identify hubs in the metapopulation structure of a
seagrass, Posidonia oceanica, because these hubs are important features for gene ﬂow
and for sustaining the dynamics of the system.
3.1.4
Graphlets
The idea of using the occurrence and frequencies of small subgraphs throughout the
structure of larger graphs began with motifs of 3 or 4 nodes (see Figure 3.3a for motifs
of three nodes and two edges in directed graphs). Important structural properties of a
graph or network can be determined by the frequencies of distinctive motifs in a range
of applications from engineering and biochemistry to ecology (Milo et al. 2002). The
concept has been extended to include graphlets of up to ﬁve nodes (Pržulj 2005, and
thereafter) as an approach to comparing biological networks. It is not the frequency of
the graphlets themselves that is important; it is the frequency of the occurrence of nodes
in particular locations on the graphlets, called “orbits” that counts (Figure 3.3b). These
have yet to be applied much in ecology (at time of writing), but more will be said on the
topic in Chapter 11.
3.2
Properties
Graph theory, and the network analysis that is based on it, has deﬁned and developed a
broad range of properties and measures to help understand and quantify the structural
features of the systems represented. Frequently, these have been produced speciﬁcally
to investigate or reﬂect properties that are closely related to the function or dynamics
of the systems being studied. This section will review many (but certainly not all) of
these that seem to be most important in the ecological context, but the list is notably
similar to those for other applications such as connectivity in the brain (see Rubinov &
Sporns 2010), or for temporal networks in which the nodes have locations only in time
(see Nicosia et al. 2013).
3.2.1
Asymmetry
This term appears often, in part because it is a fundamental property, but also because
it is applied in many different contexts. Here are ﬁve to start (more will be discussed in
Chapter 7):
1 Asymmetric relationships that are different in sign in their effect, such as parasitism
being positive for one organism, but negative for the other, are suitably portrayed in a
digraph, with edges of different signs running in different directions.

lattice by some re-wiring.
2 Even if the signs are the same, as in the (+, +) of mutualism, the effects on the
two participants may be of different strength, giving another kind of asymmetry. Bas-
compte and Jordano (2014) suggested a measure for this property in plant-animal
interactions, based on the difference between the proportions of interaction events
accounted for (“mutual dependence asymmetry,” their Appendix A).
3 In a bipartite graph of a particular interaction, asymmetry may just refer to the dif-
ference in the numbers of participants in the two strata: n1 (the plants) and n2 (the
animals). A simple measure is then W = (n1 −n2) / (n1 + n2). If the two strata have
equal numbers, the asymmetry is zero. Bascompte and Jordano (2014) called this
one “web asymmetry” (their Appendix A). In Figure 3.2a, this value is W = 2/18 =
+0.11, which is very low asymmetry for such systems that typically are less balanced.
For example, Bascompte and Jordano (2007) cited Eberling and Olesen’s arctic tun-
dra data with 30 plants and 76 pollinator species: W = −46/106 = −0.43. On the
other hand, they (Bascompte & Jordano 2014) also cited an example of frugivorous
birds and the fruit they eat in a Brazilian Atlantic rainforest with about 90 birds and
140 plants: W = +0.27.
4 In a bipartite graph of species interactions, only high degree nodes in one part (a
host with many parasites, or a plant with many pollinators) may be adjacent to a low
degree node in the other stratum (a highly specialized parasite or pollinator). Each
such pair of nodes contributes to the negative correlation of adjacent nodes’ degrees.
This version of asymmetry is closely related to the familiar concept of nestedness and
some authors refer to it as “dependence asymmetry” (see Dormann et al. 2009).
5 The “re-wiring” of a lattice graph, which starts with a regular structure of “short”
edges by adding occasional “long” edges creates an asymmetry among the nodes,
most of which have edges only to near neighbours, but others have long-distance
shortcut edges to otherwise more distant nodes. See Figure 3.4. This could be called
“node shortcut asymmetry,” and it is one feature of the Watts-Strogatz “small world”
model described in Section 3.3.3.
This does not exhaust the list of the types of asymmetry in graphs and networks as
applied in ecological contexts, but it gives a start (more in subsequent chapters!).
A shared characteristic of most inter-speciﬁc interactions is that they are indeed asym-
metric, even where the short-form summary has the signs the same, such as (−, −) or
(+, +), quantitatively if not qualitatively. There may be legitimate concern, however,

that perceived asymmetry can result from few observations of rare species versus many
observations of common ones, creating an inbuilt bias in the data (Blüthgen et al. 2008).
The two directions are often unequal in effect for the species involved, or of different
importance for their success, such as obligate for one participant versus facultative for
the other. This asymmetry is not usually so great that the interaction is reduced to a one-
way outcome for the graph and a single directed edge between nodes, although that may
be how it is portrayed for predation and in some cases for competition (a tournament
with a single designated “winner” from each pair; Chapter 6). In looking at asymmetry
of species specialization, the amount of specialization for each species is often eval-
uated simply by the number of edges for each node in an interaction graph, but this
simple measure may be affected by interaction frequencies or network size (numbers of
species; see Blüthgen et al. 2006).
3.2.2
Transitivity
The property of “transitivity” is based on triplets of nodes, and its meaning depends on
context, depending on whether the edges are directed, and whether the relationships are
symmetric.
Symmetric and Undirected Edges
For undirected edges depicting symmetric relationships, transitivity occurs whenever
edges A – B and B – C also have the edge A – C (Figure 3.5). Used in this sense, it
is closely related to the concept of a clustering coefﬁcient, which is the proportion of
two-edge triangles of nodes that are completed by the third edge.
.004
15:24:59

3.2 Properties
63
Asymmetric and Directed Edges
For directed edges, “transitivity” refers to the property that when edges A →B and B
→C occur, so does the edge A →C (Figure 3.5). The edge C →A is not the same and
does not imply transitivity. This property is further discussed in the context of competi-
tive outcomes: are there hierarchies of predictable competition results, with identiﬁable
superior competitors that always out-compete the weaker one? Or, is competition not
transitive so that A beats B, B beats C, but C beats A, as in the game “rock-paper-
scissors”? Is it possible for a species that on average does poorly in competition to
out-compete one that on average does well (a competitive reversal)? As an example,
in a study of competition among four grassland species, Silvertown and Wilson (2000)
found that competition among the four grasses was transitive with a pecking order of
invasion rates, but that the actual order depended on the grazing regime. More will
be said about competitive hierarchies and competitive reversals (see Grace et al. 1993;
Shipley & Keddy 1994) in Chapter 6.
3.2.3
Nestedness
One type of asymmetry is the association of high degree nodes in one stratum of a
bipartite graph with low degree nodes in the other stratum; for example, very special-
ized parasites are found on hosts of high parasite richness but only generalist parasites
on hosts with low parasite richness (Vázquez et al. 2005a). This is the concept of nest-
edness familiar from studies of island communities: rare species tend to be found only
at speciose sites and only common species occur at species-poor sites. A parallel ﬁnd-
ing from the studies of Vázquez et al. (2005b) is that abundant host species tend to have
richer parasite fauna and have a higher representation of rare specialist parasites. Nest-
edness is a well-deﬁned form of degree asymmetry, and it will be discussed in greater
detail in Chapter 7.
3.2.4
Degree Distribution
The degree of a node is the number of edges that join it to others. For digraphs, in-degree
and out-degree are distinguished. For signed graphs or signed digraphs, the degree can
also be divided between positive and negative. The degree of a node tells something
about its role in the structure, and the frequency distribution of the degrees for all nodes
summarizes something about the graph itself; for example, a narrow range of node
degrees, indicating a somewhat homogeneous structure, versus many singletons and
very few nodes of very high degree (the hubs). The distribution of degrees can give
clues as to the processes that gave rise to the network in the ﬁrst place, but also provide
information on how the network may be expected to perform. As a next step, it is often
useful to examine the relationship between the degrees of nodes that are neighbours,
looking at the correlation, positive or negative, among node degrees (see Figure 3.6).
This property is often included within the context of the assortative or disassortative
distribution of quantitative properties among neighbour nodes (Newman 2010), but one
might also consider the bivariate distribution of the degrees of nodes that are separated

by paths of length greater than 1: 2, 3, 4 and so on. This approach is seldom pursued in
ecological applications, but perhaps it should be.
3.2.5
Assortative Coefﬁcient
Where nodes of similar degrees tend to be adjacent, low degree to low degree and high
degree to high degree, the graph is said to be “assortative” for degree (Figure 3.6, bot-
tom). The opposite, with a strong tendency of adjacency between nodes of low degree
and nodes of high degree, is called disassortative (Figure 3.6, top right). This property
for node degree, or for any other characteristic of the nodes, is measured by an assor-
tative coefﬁcient. This is obviously analogous to a measure of spatial autocorrelation
in the space deﬁned by the graph’s own adjacency structure. It is also a measure of the
relationship between the degrees of only ﬁrst-order neighbour nodes (joined by an edge,
which is a path of length 1), but it may be useful to look at the correlation of neighbours
of second order, third order and so on.
3.2.6
Path Length
A path is an alternating sequence of nodes and the edges between them, with no repeti-
tion. A special case is a cycle, a path that begins and ends at the same node. For a simple

graph, path length is just the number of edges in the path. The graph distance between
any two nodes is the length of the shortest path between them, and the diameter of the
graph is the greatest graph distance between any two nodes within it. The concepts of
length and diameter, and so on, become more complicated when the edges have asso-
ciated weights that are actual physical (or other) distances. Then there is a distinction
to be made between graph distance and physical or weight distance (as discussed in
Chapter 1).
3.2.7
Reciprocity
In some digraphs, mutual outcomes are possible, allowing both A →B and B →A. In
that circumstance, “reciprocity” is a measure of how frequently the relationship actually
is bidirectional, usually as the proportion of edges that occur in a pair of edges between
the same two nodes (Figure 3.7). This property does not arise in all applications, but
when does arise in trophic networks, for example where it means A consumes B and
B consumes A (perhaps at different life stages), there are interesting implications for
feedback loops, the ﬂow of energy and the cycling of elements. In competition, the
expectation is that the relationship is mutually negative in its effect.
3.2.8
Centrality
“Centrality” is one measure of the “importance” of a node in the graph, related to how
well connected the node is, or how well positioned it is in many of the shortest paths
between other nodes. There are many “ﬂavours” of this concept and many measures of it,
as described in Table 3.1. Kolaczyk (2009) suggested some useful diagrams to illustrate
.004
15:24:59

3 Species Interaction Networks
Table 3.1 Centrality Measures for Graphs (Figure 3.8)
Degree Centrality: In some treatments, a node’s degree is used as a measure of its importance in the structure
and is called “degree centrality.” The basic concept of a node’s degree is the number of edges attached to
the node. This is the corresponding entry in the major diagonal of the degree matrix, D(v, v). In digraphs,
the edges have direction, and so there is a distinction between in-degree and out-degree (the number of
edges where v is the receiver or sink; the number of edges where v is the broadcast node or source).
Betweenness Centrality: The betweenness centrality of node v is the proportion of the shortest paths
(measured by path length) between any pair of nodes in G that pass through node v. For applications related
to information ﬂow, the shortness of the path may be combined with the shortest of retention times at the
node before the information is relayed to the next node in the path. In general, betweenness centrality is
based on a comparison of the number of shortest paths between nodes u and w that include node v, call it
σ(u,w|v), and the total number of such paths σ(u,w). It is usually scaled to run between 0 and 1:
Cb(v) =
N

u̸=v
N

w̸=u̸=v
2σ (u, w|v)
(N −1)(N −2)σ (u, w).
See Figure 3.8b.
Closeness Centrality: The basic closeness centrality measures the average path length distance, δ(u,v) from
node v to all other nodes, u. Nodes with shorter distance to other nodes on average have a greater centrality.
In general, for N nodes, closeness centrality, scaled to run from 0 to 1, is:
Cc(v) =
N −1
N−1
	
u̸=v
δ(u, v)
.
See Figure 3.8c.
Eigenvector (Spectral) Centrality: Includes all possible paths in its measure, not just the shortest paths,
accounting for the greater importance of shorter paths by weighting each path by a factor based on its
length, λ, αλ for some constant α. The actual calculation by which this concept is realized can be based on
the adjacency matrix A and its eigenvalues and eigenvectors: α−1 is the largest eigenvalue and ce is the
corresponding eigenvector. There are several versions of the measure possible, but the usual form is due to
Katz (1953) and Bonacich (1972). This measure is:
Ce(v) = α
D(v,v)

(u,v)∈E
ce(u).
See Figure 3.8d.
Spatial Centrality: For a spatial graph, the betweenness and closeness centralities can be modiﬁed to use
actual physical or geographic distance in place of the path length or geodesic distance of the original
formulation: d(u,v) instead of δ(u,v). A simple weighting of a node’s geographic centrality in a spatial graph
is its distance from location of the centre of gravity of all N nodes, γ , giving an index constrained to run
between 0 and 1:
cg(v) =
d(v, γ )
maxu[d(u, γ )].
This weighting can then be used to modify existing measures of centrality into a spatially responsive form. It
can also be the basis for weighting measures of edge centrality, as opposed to the measures of node
centrality discussed so far. This is illustrated in Figure 3.8e.

evaluation of the importance of individual landscape patches to overall connectivity

and the local migration and dispersal of organisms in the landscape (see Estrada &
Bodin 2008). They have also been used in evaluating how social or trophic network
structure affects individual parasite loads or diversity (Chen et al. 2008; Anderson &
Sukhdeo 2011; Duboscq et al. 2015) and the transmission of disease through time (Kim
& Anderson 2012).
3.3
Generative Models
One approach to understanding graphs and the properties they display is to create mod-
els of how graphs are formed, and with different assumptions, algorithms or parameter
values, to determine the factors that could or might lead to the properties we observe.
We can compare the observed with the results of the models based on different char-
acteristics, although a few such as node degree distribution, path length and clustering
coefﬁcients are the most popular. Just as there are many characteristics to consider,
there are also many different models that can generate graphs with different combina-
tions of properties. The ones presented here are probably the three most commonly used
for comparison and understanding. Part of the inspiration for investigating these mod-
els was to mimic or explain characteristics of large real networks, such as the Internet.
These tend to exhibit (a) degree distributions with a small modal value, but a very long
tail, related to very few nodes with very many connections (hubs); (b) “small world”
characteristic of surprisingly short average path lengths between nodes; (c) clustering
coefﬁcient (proportion of completed triangles of edges) that is high for the edge density;
and (d) assortativeness coefﬁcient that is positive if not large, indicating some autocor-
relation of characteristics among near neighbours.
The small world characteristic gets its name from the concept that the global social
network ensures that no one in the world is more than six “degrees of separation” or six
phone links away from anyone, Prime Ministers and Presidents included. This idea has
a long history, but it is often credited to Karinthy (1929 as cited in Watts 2003) although
best explicated in its modern form by Watts (2003). The culture of graph theory itself
has its own version of this; each author has an “Erdös number,” which is the number
of co-author links that must be traversed to get back to Erdös himself as a co-author.
My own is low (2), because I published with John Moon (see Chapter 2 of this book;
and then Erdös & Moon 1964). (Remember that there may be 5000 researchers around
the world with an Erdös number of 2.) A good topic for discussion with our ecology
graduate students (over beer, perhaps) would be to determine the ecologist who would
be the best choice as the “Erdös” of publications in ecology. (What’s your MacArthur
number?) Watts (1999) pointed out that the secret of small world social networks is that
almost anyone can be considered central to the structure, with almost everyone just a
few steps away. While the “six degrees of separation” idea is almost an urban myth, short
inter-node path length is an important feature to characterize graphs of model networks.
The small world characteristic also takes the form of mutual adjacency, in which
“my friends are your friends,” giving a high clustering coefﬁcient, and many triangular
motifs in the network graph. In a slightly more diffuse form (“my friends are friends
.004
15:24:59

3.3 Generative Models
69
of your friends”), the graph is highly modularized, even if triangles are not surprisingly
common, with a high degree of modularity (highly connected subgraphs) evident.
I cite Newman’s (2010) book frequently in what follows, not that it is the only source,
but it provides an authoritative and comprehensive review of this material, conveniently
in a single work that is up-to-date and easily available. Kolaczyk (2009) has provided a
very useful account of statistics for these structures and properties, which we ecologists
may tend to neglect as being too technical; but certainly worth the effort.
3.3.1
Random Graphs (Erdös-Rényi or Poisson Random Graph)
The inquiry into the development and characterization of random graphs as null models
for comparisons was begun by Erdös and Rényi in the late 1950s and early 1960s (start-
ing with Erdös & Rényi 1960), building graphs in an unconstrained manner by sequen-
tially adding edges to a set of nodes into random positions not already occupied. Edges
can be added with a given and constant probability, or they can be added up to a pre-
deﬁned density, K edges for N nodes. The properties of such graphs are well known and
understood; for example, the node degrees follow a Poisson distribution. Their proper-
ties, however, are not usually a good match for the graphs encountered in real networks,
whether from sociology, molecular biology or ecology, or from transportation or com-
munication network studies. Because they are purely random in their construction, they
tend not to have much internal structure: no clustering, for example, and no correlation
between the degrees of neighbouring nodes (see Newman 2010, Chapter 12). This is
not surprising. In addition, if the edge density is low, the path length between randomly
chosen pairs of nodes tends to be large or effectively inﬁnite in that the graph may have
disconnected components. Typically, there is one large connected component, the “giant
component,” and a few or many small ones. With increasing edge density, the average
path length declines markedly, so that even very large random graphs can have short
path lengths, as in the small world phenomenon. Even so, the clustering coefﬁcient (the
frequency of completed triangles of edges) remains low. All these characteristics, and
many more besides, have well-studied properties and distributions in random graphs
(see Newman 2010), which can then provide useful comparisons.
3.3.2
Scale Free (Barabási-Albert)
Unlike the random graph model, which adds edges but not nodes as the graph devel-
ops, the Barabási-Albert approach pictures a growing network to which nodes are added
sequentially. Edges are added, too, as the network grows, but not in an unconstrained
random way. Each new node has a set number of edges to add, c, but they connect pref-
erentially, with the probability that a potential recipient node receives the new edge is
proportional to the number of edges it already has. It’s a case of “The rich get richer.” to
quote Watts (1999). Because each node has at least c edges, c of its own to start plus any
number it acquires from subsequent node additions, the node degree distribution has a
well-deﬁned minimum at c (Newman 2010, Chapter 14). As a result of the preferential
attachment algorithm, the degree distribution follows a power law: most nodes have a

small degree, with a small-valued mode, but there is a very long tail, with very few
nodes have very large degrees (hubs), just as observed in well-studied networks like the
Internet or airline routes (see Newman 2010, Chapter 8). The term “scale free” comes
from the lack of deﬁnite end to or marked drop-off in the tail of the distribution (because
it is governed by a power law); if present, that drop-off would indicate the inherent
scale of the ﬁrst-order neighbourhoods (Watts 1999; Newman 2010). The straight-line
decay of the degree distribution, without a clear point of sharper decline, gives no indi-
cation of a limit to the maximum degree.

between nodes that are initially distant from each other. The starting structure is typ-
ically a homogeneous “ring graph” of N nodes, each initially joined to its 2m nearest
neighbours (most easily visualized as a spatial graph in the plane Figure 3.9a), giving
K = mN edges. The randomness and “long-distance connections” are added by moving
one edge from each node to a randomly (and uniformly) chosen node with probability
p, leaving the edge in its original position with probability (1 −p) (Figure 3.9b). A vari-
ant is to leave the original ring graph intact and merely add random edges as shortcuts
between distant nodes (Figure 3.9c; Newman 2010, Chapter 15). The result in either
case is a graph with the small world property that the greatest distance between any two
nodes is typically very short (remember “six degrees of separation”) even for nodes that
were very far apart in the original. This model resembles many real network graphs in
its clustering and short path lengths, but the distribution of node degrees is tight and
unimodal with a non-zero lower bound and a short but heavy upper tail, quite unlike the
very long-tailed distributions often observed.

3.3 Generative Models

Table 3.2 Summary of Three Generative Models
Context: Large-scale real networks tend to exhibit (a) degree distributions with a small modal value, but a
very long tail; (b) small world characteristics of short inter-nodal paths; (c) a clustering coefﬁcient that is
high for edge density; and (d) an assortative coefﬁcient that is positive if not large.
Erdös-Rényi (E-R) (Random)
Process:
start with N nodes; sequential addition of edges 1 to K in random positions
Characteristics:
degree distribution is binomial to Poisson (bell shaped)
path lengths surprisingly short for higher densities of edges (paths long for very low
density)
clustering coefﬁcient low
no clusters, no autocorrelation (node characteristics not assortative)
Note:
Some results apply to bipartite graphs, as well as to unipartite, but not all. The clustering
coefﬁcient in the unipartite projection of a bipartite graph can remain high as N
becomes large.
Barabási-Albert (Scale free)
Process:
sequential node addition, each with c edges, but positively preferential edge insertion
Characteristics:
degree distribution: low mode, long tail governed by power law
path lengths increase logarithmically with N, but are shorter than E-R
clustering coefﬁcient low, but higher than E-R
no clusters, but assortative by node degree
Watts-Strogatz (Small world)
Process:
start with homogeneous regular graph, random re-wiring or edge addition
Characteristics:
degree distribution is compact, unimodal, with no long tail but not symmetric (more
weight in the tail above the mode)
path lengths short
clustering coefﬁcient high
clusters of nodes, no autocorrelation (not assortative by node degree)
These are only three of many possible approaches to modelling the development of
graphs. The fully random model sets a good benchmark for comparison, as a very simple
null model, but ecologists should remember that the other two were developed speciﬁ-
cally to mimic small world and scale-free properties observed in some social and anthro-
pogenic networks (see Table 3.2). These are null models developed for a speciﬁc set of
characteristics. They may not be the best descriptions or even good comparators for net-
work graphs arising from natural species interactions, especially in the bipartite format
appropriate for mutualisms and antagonistic relationships among species.
Some guidance for applying ﬁndings from unipartite networks to bipartite cases is
provided by Newman et al. (2002) (see also Watts 2003; Newman 2010). The bipar-
tite structure they considered began with (1) groups of people, and (2) the individuals
that belong to the groups; edges run only between the two groups not within. These
particular bipartite graphs represent what are called “afﬁliation networks” for obvious
reasons; the individuals are related through their common membership in groups and
groups are related through having individual members in common. Associated with the
bipartite structure are two unipartite graphs: (a) a cluster diagram (undirected graph) of
the groups with edges between the groups that are similar based on the individuals that
.004

are their members, and (b) a cluster diagram (undirected graph) of the individuals with
edges between those that are similar based on the groups of which they are members
(Watts 2003, Figure 4.6). The comforting result is that most of the properties discovered
for random unipartite graphs (E-R model) extend naturally to random bipartite graphs
or to their unipartite projections. What emerges, however, is that there are some impor-
tant differences. In a random unipartite graph, the clustering coefﬁcient declines as the
number of nodes increases, but a fully random bipartite network will continue to exhibit
a high degree of clustering as N increases, despite the fact that there is no extra structure
built into it, just because of the way the graph is constructed (Newman et al. 2002). This
insight is very helpful in interpreting structural features of the bipartite graphs we use
in studying mutualistic or antagonistic species interactions. These ecological bipartite
graphs do not arise in exactly the same way as the original afﬁliation graphs, but the
properties should be the same. For example, a pollination network is the equivalent of
an afﬁliation network because plant A belongs to groups deﬁned by its pollinators, one
group per pollinator, and the pollinators can be grouped according the plants they pol-
linate, A, B, C, D and so on, thus creating an afﬁliation network in either direction, as
in the social grouping case that gave rise to the concept. This comment applies equally
well to other ecological interactions that give rise to bipartite graphs.

Comparisons
3.4.1
Comparing Observed Network Graphs with Models
For comparing observed graphs to models, Table 3.2 gives an obvious place to start: a
beginning can be made by comparing the shape of the degree distribution, the character-
istic path length or average inter-node distance, the clustering coefﬁcient and clustering
and assortativity measures with those typical of the various models available with the
same number of nodes and same density of edges. Watts (1999) provided a good exam-
ple of this comparative approach. He tabulated the number of nodes, average degree
(equivalent to edge density), characteristic path length, clustering coefﬁcient, a model-
independent shortcut index, ϕ, and a contraction index, ψ, for a number of real network
graphs to illustrate the characterization of network graphs by their properties.
The last two measures may be unfamiliar. The ﬁrst is related to the concept of a
“shortcut,” deﬁned as an edge between nodes i and j which if removed results in
the shortest path remaining between edges being of length greater than 2 (consider
Figure 3.9b). That means that there is no triangle of edges on edge i to j; neither is
it a bridge whose removal disconnects the graph. The index, ϕ, is the proportion of
edges that are shortcuts thus deﬁned. The second index, ψ, is the fraction of all the
pairs of nodes that have no edge between them and that share one and only one neigh-
bour. Obviously both these indices are based on the existence (or not, in this case) of
triangles of edges in the network graph.
In the comparison that Watts (1999) compiled, three network graphs were used for
illustration. The ﬁrst is the “Kevin Bacon Graph,” documenting the association structure
.004

73
of actors in ﬁlms based on joint appearance with and separation from joint appearance
with Kevin Bacon. This is the ﬁlm equivalent of the graph theorists’ Erdös number, well
almost . . . The second example is the Western States Power Graph which details the
structure of the electricity transmission grid in the western USA. The third example is
the neural network of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, one of the most completely
“decoded” organisms in the scientiﬁc world.
To compare these real graphs with models, the main focus of Watts’s (1999) inves-
tigation was on the characteristic path length (one aspect of the small world property,
the title of the work after all!) and the clustering coefﬁcient (a small world property
related to the presence of internal structure). Where a model is well deﬁned and its
properties are known, as for the Erdös-Rényi model, the observed value of a measure
can be compared with its expected value, given N nodes and K edges. In comparison
with the fully random (E-R) graph, all three real graphs had high values of the clustering
coefﬁcient, indicating signiﬁcant amounts of small world internal structure; the social
network and neural network had small values for the characteristic path length, com-
parable to the random graph, but the transmission network had longer paths between
nodes than expected. The conclusion from these comparisons was that all three net-
works had graph-theoretical properties associated with the small world phenomenon
(Watts 1999). The use of path length and the clustering coefﬁcient continues to be an
appealing approach to the evaluation and comparison of networks for different sizes and
edge densities in a number of applications (see e.g. van Wijk et al. 2010).
3.4.2
Monte Carlo Graph Generation
In theory, the advantage of comparing real network graphs to theory-based graph mod-
els is that the models can be engineered to resemble the characteristics of the networks
being studied. For example, it is often desirable to make comparisons with random
structures that have been created with the same distribution of node degrees as the orig-
inal network of interest (Newman 2010, Chapter 10). Clearly this is a kind of restricted
randomization and its possibilities are limited only by programming and the potential
lack of independence among the network properties constrained to give the best com-
parability with the observed structure. There are also practical limitations depending on
the size of the network to be imitated (very large networks can present computational
challenges even today), but in theory, again, large numbers of random-but-constrained
networks can be generated in a “Monte Carlo” approach, thus producing distributions
of the measures of interest.
The other form of constrained randomization that can work well in this context is
the repeated permutation of observed structures to generate distributions for evaluating
observed parameter values. Straying a bit from ecological applications, in a study of the
modular dynamics of human brains, Bassett et al. (2011) randomized the edges from
an observed network structure to show that its modularity was very signiﬁcantly high.
This approach is certainly within the range of methods ecologists can and should take
advantage of in their own research.

3.4.3
Comparing Two or More Observed Network Graphs
Comparing two observed network graphs is not necessarily the same as determining
how similar they are, as discussed in Chapter 1. Consider two graphs on the same set of
labelled nodes and with the same number of edges. A high proportion of the edges may
occupy the same positions in the two graphs, giving a high similarity between them,
but with important differences in such characteristics as degree distributions or assor-
tativity. For example, comparing the graphs in Figures 3.9a and 3.9b, the graphs share
21 of 24 edges, but have different degree distributions and different graph diameters.
On the other hand, it is possible under the same conditions to have two graphs that are
very similar in their properties, but differ markedly in the positions occupied by the
edges (just consider relabelling the nodes!), as shown in Figure 3.10. As one of many
examples, in a study of plant-pollinator networks in the sub-alpine over several years,
Burkle and Irwin (2009) found that although joint ﬂower-insect interaction frequencies
changed from year to year, properties like connectance and nestedness did not; nor were
these properties affected by nitrogen addition.
The Monte Carlo approach described in Section 4.3.2 has potential, but each observed
network is like a single realization of some underlying model (unknown) with many pos-
sible (unknown) parameters, and we researchers do not have the opportunity to observe
many realizations to evaluate the range of variability, nor do we have the opportunity
to “tune” the results by examining a range of values for the parameters. (We don’t even
know what the parameters ought to be!) The outcome is that while we can compare
many runs of two models, one for each network to be compared, and we can then exam-
ine similarities and differences between the distributions, we will not know how well
the models actually represent the structure and processes that underlie the two networks
of interest.
That may leave only comparing individual values of measures thought to be important
indicators of relevant characteristics for the two network graphs. The comfort is that
interpreting these results can be informed by “playing with” “reasonable” models of the
two networks so that we understand better the performance of the measures we have
chosen and their response to changes in the parameters that govern the structure. Again,

75
there are theoretical and practical limits on what can be accomplished, but it should be
an improvement over simple naïve comparisons of a large number of characteristics.
3.4.4
Randomization by Edge Permutation
Most of these comments apply not only to network graphs in general, but also to
bipartite graphs, with modiﬁcations to distributions generated for null hypotheses. For
example, in a fully random graph for a bipartite structure, there are limitations on the
positions for edges, allowing only n1 × n2 possible positions. This is fewer than the
½(n1 + n2)(n1 + n2 −1) available in a unipartite graph with the same number of nodes;
for example, for a total of ten nodes with ﬁve in each part, the number of edge positions
is only 25 in the bipartite version, not 45. With these or similar modiﬁcations to account
for the structure, most of the results from the general case can apply.
3.4.5
Graph Kernels
Recent and current developments for the comparison of graphs and for measuring their
similarity have been based on “graph kernels” (Gärtner 2003, 2008; Vishwanathan et al.
2010; Shervashidze et al. 2011), related to the general use of kernel functions for pat-
tern analysis and machine learning (Shawe-Taylor & Cristianini 2004; Gärtner 2008;
Hofmann et al. 2008). A kernel is a function of two mathematical objects (such as two
graphs) that measures their similarity, and it is commonly used in applications such as
pattern analysis to compare structures in mathematical space (e.g. two sets of multi-
variate data in s – dimensions; think of principle components analysis data). The kernel
function is often based on inner products in the mathematical space in which the objects
(e.g. the graphs) exist, or on a direct product of the two objects (Shervashidze et al.
2011). This approach is popular in machine learning where the graph kernels can be
based on (random) walks, shortest paths, small subgraphs of limited size (like motifs or
graphlets), or subtree patterns (Gärtner 2003; Bunescu & Mooney 2005; Shervashidze
et al. 2011). Figure 3.11 gives two graphs to be compared; short independent random
walks beginning at nodes 4 and 4ʹ (or nodes 1 and 1ʹ) will often be the same similarities
based on the structures of the graphs; the graph kernel captures those similarities in a
computationally efﬁcient way.
The basic advantage of the kernel approach comes from the concept of mapping a
mathematical object, x, from its own data space into a “feature space” in which analysis
is simpliﬁed, by some mapping function ϕ(x). In order to compare two objects of inter-
est, x and xʹ, mapping them both explicitly with function ϕ may pose computational
complexity for more detailed objects; but the explicit mapping may not be necessary
because a kernel function, k (x, xʹ), can be based on their cross product from which k
(x, xʹ) = < ϕ(x), ϕ(xʹ)>. The stratagem that avoids the explicit mapping is sometimes
called the “kernel trick” (Hofmann et al. 2008), but the usefulness is that the kernel
function itself measures the similarity of x and xʹ, because it takes higher values with
more features they share (Gärtner 2003, 2008).

This is an interesting and directly useful approach to comparing graphs, but as far as I
know, it has yet to be used in ecological applications, although closely related techniques
based on motifs to compare internal substructures of graphs have been used to good
effect (e.g. Stouffer et al. 2007). One aspect of this technique that is not clear is whether
it can be reﬁned to identify parts of the graphs that are most or least similar, to determine
what characteristics are most or least similar, or how similarity changes with scale, such
as the size of the subgraphs used in the kernel. More details about this approach and its
properties will be provided in Chapter 12.
As described in Chapter 2, tree-based kernels are an obvious approach to comparing
the dendrograms or classiﬁcation structures and have been used in the analysis of natural
languages (Moschitti 2006; Sun et al. 2011) and in phylogeny (Poon et al. 2013). I have
not seen this approach used in ecological studies, but the models are there to follow and
Poon et al. (2013) have provided a good example of its use in a biological application.
3.4.6
Special Case of Graph Comparison: Distances
If the two graphs to be compared are on the same nodes and the nodes can be located
within some kind of space, most easily a spatial context but not necessarily, and if the
two graphs are based on independent sets of data, their similarity can be tested using
an eigenfunction decomposition. For graphs with undirected edges (symmetric rela-
tionships) Moran’s eigenvector maps (“MEM” eigenfunctions; Dray et al. 2006) can
be used, and for digraphs, the parallel method is the use of asymmetric eigenvector
maps (“AEM” eigenfunctions; Blanchet et al. 2008). The method begins with the graphs
represented as standard adjacency matrices in binary form, or with non-zero weights
for adjacent nodes, which is then converted to a distance matrix. Without giving the
details here (see Borcard et al. 2004; Dray et al. 2006, 2012; Blanchet et al. 2008,
2011), the graphs are converted to eigenvectors and then a generalized Pearson cor-
relation coefﬁcient, called RV (for vector correlation; Escouﬁer 1973; Abdi 2007), is
calculated to evaluate their similarity. (This measure is available in R, as coeffRV in
FACTOMINER.)

3.5
Concluding Comments
Obviously there are many approaches to understanding and evaluating the graphs of
species interactions as portrayed by networks based on observations. Equally obvious is
the fact that these interactions are very basic and important components of how ecolog-
ical systems work, with strong effects on population and community dynamics and on
the evolution of the organisms involved. While “interaction” here refers most directly to
the relationships among the species or taxa in the communities, the topology of the same
networks also interacts with the functioning of the ecological system: network structure

inﬂuences system dynamics and the dynamics of the system, in turn, can cause changes
in that structure. There will be more detail and more discussion of this higher level inter-
action later in the book (Chapter 11). That discussion is often framed in the terms of
complexity and stability, but equally important are the sizes and directions of changes
to network structure (and thus in function) that a relaxation of stability or resilience can
allow.
Admitting that the interactions between species are many, varied, multiple, often
ambiguous or indirect, even malleable, and always complex, the material that develops
the concept is nevertheless divided into four chapters that follow, based on an over-
simpliﬁed taxonomy: food webs, species associations, competition and a catch-all for
mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. More direct advice on smart things to do with
graph theory and networks for ecological applications will be provided in those more
focussed chapters. Simpliﬁed or not, the network approach and an increased sophisti-
cation in our ability to take advantage of the graph theory that applies is convincing as
the best way forward for understanding these challenging ecological systems. Studying
structure to understand function is often the best way to attack daunting complexity, but
the thoughtful converse of studying function to understand structure will also provide
rewards to ecologists working in these difﬁcult systems.

Trophic Networks: Structure,
Partitioning and Dynamics
Introduction
Predation is an obviously important interaction between species, affecting the fate of
individuals, population densities and evolution; but it also affects the ﬂow of energy
and the cycling of elements in an ecosystem through the complex network of such
interactions, known collectively as a food web or trophic network. For inter-speciﬁc
interactions of predation or consumption, the interacting species fall naturally into two
classes, predator and prey, but most studies acknowledge that, in these relationships, any
two species are strongly affected by other species in their trophic layers. Those include
other prey of the same predator or other predators of the same prey, as well as those in
adjacent layers. Thus, although the focus of research may be the interaction between the
snowshoe hare and the lynx, as the classic example of prey and predator in the boreal
forest (Figure 4.1), there needs to be consideration of the hare’s interactions with its
own “prey” (food plants), with other herbivores, and with predators other than the lynx,
as well as the lynx’s interaction with those other predators (Krebs 2010; Krebs et al.
2001). The Kluane boreal forest ecosystem study provides a good example of what we
know and what we do not know about trophic networks and their implications for the
communities of organisms and for ecosystem function. It really started with the ques-
tion of what causes the observed cycles in the lynx and snowshoe hare populations, but
became a big study in every way, with many layers and species, large spatial and tem-
poral extents, and a number of experimental manipulations such as exclusion fences,
food and fertilizer. The details of the study and its results appear in many publications,
but are summarized in Krebs et al. (2001). The focus of this discussion, however, is the
trophic network digraph of Figure 4.1, which omits much of the detail but provides a
good example of what might appear to be a textbook food web with a trophic hierarchy
of plants, herbivores and carnivores, but with enough variants to make it interesting.
Based on a digraph of a trophic network, how can graph theory provide insights of
ecological value?
To start, the layers in any trophic hierarchy may not be well deﬁned, with the poten-
tial of interactions apparently within the same layer (e.g. cannibalism or intra-guild
predation; see the “self” loop edges and “predator-predator” edges in trophic network
digraph) or including more than one trophic level such as omnivory by squirrels or
bears (not included because of their rarity). The Kluane study observed mortality in
young snowshoe hares attributable to predation by two “herbivores,” ground squirrels

and red squirrels (Figure 4.1). In a different way, the distinctness of the layers may also
be blurred by leeches or mosquitoes, which “prey upon” herbivore and carnivore alike.
A realistic approach to such interactions then requires the inclusion of many organisms,
as well as all their interactions. Studies of these systems are portrayed by multi-level
directed graphs, but edges may occur between nodes in the same subsets or between lev-
els at more than one remove. The edges depict only predation or consumption and often
have quantitative labels or weights that estimate the relative importance of each trophic
link. In studying data to create a trophic network digraph for further analysis, there is a
choice between including all observed interactions as equivalent edges no matter how
common or how rare, selecting only the strongest, or including a quantitative measure
for each. Any of them will provide important insights, although there is some evidence
that the quantitative approach, which essentially removes rare interactions from con-
sideration, actually makes the networks simpler, rather than more complex (Banašek-
Richter et al. 2009). Trophic network complexity (vs simplicity) is a property of obvious
interest to ecologists, and it is often measured by graph connectance, the proportion of
possible edges that occur (m/n2) in a digraph, or m/2n(n −1) if reciprocal interactions
are disallowed; but it is not the only measure and edges per node, m/n, which equals
connectance × size is an alternative (Dunne et al. 2002b).
In a multi-layered digraph of trophic structure, the directionality of the edges between
the layers may seem pro forma, and would make sense in either direction as long as they
are consistent, but the directions within layers require special consideration. In almost
every case, there should be only one directed edge between any pair of nodes; real reci-
procity is rare and apparent reciprocal interactions may result from over-generalization
in the categories used to deﬁne nodes, and further reﬁnement may resolve it.

15:25:06

Introduction
81
The basic structure of the digraph means that some of the measures used to character-
ize graphs, such as average path length or node centrality, will have a different interpre-
tation than in spatial or spatially based networks. For trophic networks, one motivating
concern is the relationship between complexity and stability, and graph theory makes its
crucial contribution to the study by quantifying a number of different aspects of “com-
plexity.” The lengths of component chains in the trophic networks are also important
characteristics because of the close relationship with the energy ﬂow in the ecosystem;
longer chains have more transfers with energy lost at each transfer. Other characteris-
tics such as compartments and nestedness are important in these digraphs, particularly
in their effects on system dynamics such as cascades of changes, resilience and robust-
ness to disturbance or chaos, cycles and synchrony. A third set of characteristics, the
distribution of degree nodes and of neighbouring node degrees, are important for the
same kinds of reasons.
The relationships in trophic networks are fundamentally asymmetric, and this asym-
metry requires directed edges in the graphs. The real meaning of trophic networks often
lies in their dynamics, and the dynamics are usually dependent on quantitative fac-
tors; therefore, edges are more informative if they are more than just binary, often with
weights showing rates of energy or biomass transfer. Similarly, the nodes are more use-
ful if they have weights representing the number of individuals of a species, the energy
they represent, or some measure of the biomass “standing crop.” In a more sophisticated
representation of a trophic network, the edges and nodes may have equations associated
with them that describe the dynamics of the interactions among species, and provide the
implications of any changes as they propagate through the network.
In the resulting trophic network graph, therefore:
r Nodes have labels indicating their species or guild or functional group (e.g. “grasses”
or “zooplankton”), often with a quantitative measure of amounts available or even
equations governing the interactive dynamics of those amounts.
r Edges have directions (A to B is distinct from B to A) and usually quantitative
weights, representing amounts or rates of transfer. In almost every case, there can be
or will be only one edge between any pair of nodes. Reciprocity is very rare, although
it may occur as life-stage (juvenile vs adult) dependent, and may look more like inter-
ference competition. For example, in the Kluane study, it was found that raptor-raptor
predation was surprisingly common, especially during the period of low snowshoe
hare densities (Doyle & Smith 2001).
r Edges and nodes may have equations associated with them, instead of static weights,
to give the dynamics of the network as the interactions between species occur and
affect the entire system.
This chapter will consider smart things that graph theory can contribute to studies of
trophic networks, with their implications for energy ﬂow and the function of ecosys-
tems and their inclusion of the complexities of multi-species (not just many pairwise)
interactions.

4 Trophic Networks: Structure, Partitioning and Dynamics
The (Smart) Things to Do
r Find distinguishing characteristics of the network structure. For example: Are
there clearly separable compartments? Are specialist predators paired with spe-
cialist prey? Does the structural signature change through time? With season?
With years? With ecological succession?
r Determine common repeated structural elements of the digraph and interpret.
Interpretation may well depend on whether the motifs are higher up or lower down
in the trophic network graph (compare with similar evaluation of a competition
hierarchy discussed in Chapter 6).
r Find key species in the structure:
r They may be distinguished by high in-degree or high out-degree.
r Network neighbour characteristics may also indicate key species: consider neigh-
bour in-degree versus out-degree, and above versus below in food chains.
r Identify and characterize individual nodes with unusual properties (“keystone
species”; Paine 1969) that have crucial or disproportional effects on the network’s
function.
r Compare structural characteristics with those of with general trophic network
models. For example, how well deﬁned or well observed is the hierarchy of trophic
levels?

Trophic Networks and Derived Graphs
The basic graph used to depict a trophic network is a digraph with nodes representing
species or “trophic species,” which are groups of taxonomic species that have the same
predators and the same prey (loosely speaking) (see Sugihara 1982). The edges are
directed from prey to predator wherever there is a trophic relationship between the two
species, and may be simple or weighted by rates or amounts of predation. Generally,
edges representing cannibalism or self-predation are omitted, but two such edges are
included, in grey, in Figure 4.1.
4.1.1
Derived Graphs
A number of graphs can be derived from this basic structure; begin with two. (1) The
ﬁrst is the “trophic-niche overlap graph” (among other names, e.g. the “shared prey
graph” or just “overlap graph”), with non-directed edges connecting nodes of species
that share at least one common prey. Figure 4.2a provides an example. (2) The second is
the “shared predator graph” (the “common enemy graph”; Lundgren & Maybee 1984),
as in Figure 4.2b. It is conceivable that the components of a trophic network and its
connections are mainly determined by a single organism characteristic such as body

size, with size determining the range of prey species each predator species can eat as
well as the kinds of predators that can eat it (see Woodward et al. 2005). This is analo-
gous to a plant community dominated by a single environmental factor, such as time of
emergence on a sea shore, that gives rise to a zoned community with overlapping and
non-overlapping species ranges on the shore.
With a single dominant factor, the shared prey graph can be very similar to a math-
ematically determined graph called an interval graph, and this similarity can provide

insights into the relationships within the trophic network (Cohen & Palka 1990). An
interval graph is derived from a ﬁnite number of intervals on the real line, or something
equivalent such as a sheaf of parallel line segments in ﬁxed positions (like those sea-
weed ranges up and down a shore). Each interval is represented by a node of the interval
graph and two such nodes have an edge between them when their corresponding inter-
vals have non-zero overlap. The edge between nodes A and B in Figure 4.3, reﬂects the
overlap of intervals A and B (the overlap is two units); there is no edge between A and
E because their intervals do not overlap on the real line. (An interesting variant, which
can be left for now, is to have a directed edge from node X to node Y whenever interval
X completely overlaps [or includes] interval Y, and an undirected or bidirectional edge
when the overlap is partial; see Pielou 1977; Dale 1999, Chapter 8, for more on patterns
of spatial range overlap.)
The concept of an organism’s niche is often expressed in terms of a multi-dimensional
hyper-volume, describing the ranges of conditions under which the organism can thrive.
It is easy to see how the overwhelming dominance of a single niche axis could give
rise to the mathematical conditions like those that produce an interval graph. Figure
4.3 gives an artiﬁcial example, where the prey are neatly organized by size, and the
predators, also organized by size, respond predictably with the range of prey sizes they
use. Just how easily the trophic network data can be re-arranged to resemble an interval
graph tells how dominant any single axis may be. Figure 4.4 for the Kluane data makes
it easier by choosing a convenient order for the plants and by including the fungi that are

important food sources for some of the herbivores. Another wrinkle in this approach is
the inclusion of a species as a single “prey” where in fact leaves, bark and seeds should
be treated as separate resources. The degree to which this is possible is the graph’s
“intervality.” Intervality is essentially an evaluation of how well the trophic network’s
structure can be explained by a single niche axis, and its measure can be simply binary,
yes or no; interval or non-interval; or it can be a continuous measure (Stouffer et al.
2006; Capitán et al. 2013). The overall ﬁnding of the extensive study by Cohen and
Palka (1990) was that the more species that were included, the less likely it was that the
network would be consistent with an interval graph; that is, less likely to be explained by
a single niche axis. The result is not surprising, but there is more that the graph theory
approach might be able to provide, for example an assessment of the properties of the
node degrees of ﬁrst- and second-order neighbours in the interval graph.
4.1.2
Subgraphs
Based on the full community or ecosystem trophic network, there are two subgraphs
that are often extracted for further analysis. A “source” trophic network is the subgraph
of all nodes and links that form a directed connected graph from a single basal species,
for example “birch” in Figure 4.1. The corresponding “sink” trophic network is the sub-
graph that is associated with a top predator, such the lynx in Figure 4.1, again forming
a directed and connected network of its own.

4.1.3
Data
As discussed in Chapter 1, the data on which these trophic network graphs are based
include counts of predation events, studies of diets and energetics, estimates of con-
sumption rates, as well as demographic studies of component populations. Different
parts of the trophic network, both the species as nodes and the interactions as edges,
may require different approaches and different measures to provide effective evalua-
tions; one of the most complete studies of a very complicated system is the Kluane
ecosystem project, already referred to and summarized by Krebs et al. (2001). Simpler
ecosystems, artiﬁcial “microcosms” or larger “mesocosms” (often aquatic), with fewer
species and fewer complications may be easier to quantify with a “common currency”
such as energy content; allowing more straightforward quantitative analysis, whatever
other difﬁculties such systems may present. Much progress has been made by studies
of natural microcosms provided by the systems in pitcher plants and similar “container
habitats” (phytotelmata), which contain relatively limited ﬂora and fauna (see Kitching
2000). The quantitative assessment is especially important in the study of trophic net-
works because much of the understanding of the features of their structure (e.g. degree
of connectivity or generality of herbivore consumption) is based on mathematical mod-
els, for which quantities are crucial. In turn, these structural features and the numbers
associated with them determine the stability of the trophic network and the ecosys-
tem within which it is embedded, and their vulnerability to disturbance or change. This
fact can create serious problems for trophic network studies in which the information
is compiled from more than one study, possibly using different measures for different
subsets of organisms, and concerns about the commensurability of quantities within the
one network, particularly when it comes to the assessment of interaction strength (see
McCann 2012).
4.2
Trophic Network Characteristics
4.2.1
Basic Graph Statistics
The graphs used to depict and analyze trophic networks are almost always digraphs,
with a direction associated with each edge, but many of the standard statistics such as
node degree, inter-node distances, connectance, and clustering coefﬁcient remain useful
measures for comparing the topology of these special networks (Cartozo et al. 2006).
A node’s degree is just its number of edges, here representing trophic links, and there-
fore distinguishing between in-degree and out-degree (number of prey species vs num-
ber of predator interactions). The ratio of the two obviously changes from the base of
the trophic network (no prey) to the apex (no predators). The distribution of degrees,
determined by ﬁtting curves to the data (e.g. power law vs exponential decay) can
be an important characteristic (again combining in- and out-degree, or keeping them
separate), but trophic network data often have too few nodes to make distribution ﬁt-
ting reliable or convincing (see Cartozo et al. 2006). The average degree is related to
.005
15:25:06

4.2 Trophic Network Characteristics

connectance, the proportion of all possible interactions (in theory n2) that are realized in
the network, call the proportion c = m / n2. Early studies suggested that there might be
good support for the “constant connectance hypothesis” that c would reliably take val-
ues around 0.1 (Martinez 1991); but more recent studies have shown that connectance
tends to decrease with n for both quantitative and qualitative data (Banašek-Richter
et al. 2009).
Another basic graph statistic often cited is the clustering coefﬁcient; this is the pro-
portion of pairs of neighbours of a given node that are themselves joined by an edge,
averaged over all nodes (see Chapter 1). “Small world” characteristics include cluster-
ing coefﬁcients that are higher and average distances between nodes that are smaller
than in random graphs. Although clustering coefﬁcients in real trophic networks do not
seem to be consistently higher than expected, they do seem to have unexpectedly few
trophic levels and small average distances (Cartozo et al. 2006). In fact, Williams et al.
(2002) suggested that in large complex trophic networks, the average distance between
nodes is only two, with 95 percent of all species pairs being within three steps of each
other.
To do: calculate average distances, clustering coefﬁcient and maximum trophic level.
Are these unexpectedly small? Unexpectedly large?
4.2.2
Taxonomic Aggregation
The interpretation of the basic statistics of trophic network graphs may be inﬂuenced
by the ﬁneness of the resolution of taxonomic categories that the nodes in the network
represent. In Figure 4.1, some of the nodes are well-deﬁned species (e.g. goshawk),
whereas others are groupings of species that may aggregate broad taxonomic collec-
tions of different species and different genera (e.g. grasses or forbs), possibly including
both native and introduced taxa. Obviously this taxonomic aggregation affects the num-
bers of nodes and edges in the digraph (see Figure 4.5), which will affect the properties
we want to analyze. Bascompte and Jordano (2014) reported, in an unpublished study,
that in a model trophic network, originally with a well-deﬁned “scale-free” distribution,
progressive aggregation of species produced a power law distribution, a truncated power
law and then an exponential distribution. This demonstrates that the effects of aggrega-
tion cannot be ignored in any interpretation of graph-theoretical properties of trophic
networks.
In addition to the effect on the properties and distribution of node degrees, both ﬁrst
and second order, aggregation will hamper any evaluation of nestedness (what’s actu-
ally rare? which species are preferred food?) and also homophily or assortativeness
measures. For more than a single herbivore the taxonomic aggregation of food plants
may distort any evaluation of resource overlap (shared prey). As a simplistic and artiﬁ-
cial example, Figure 4.6 shows the apparent sharing of food plants by ground squirrels
and hares (forbs and grasses) that may result from aggregating the food plants that
are in fact separate lists for the two herbivores. When trophic network dynamics are
being investigated by quantitative methods and modelling, aggregation can be “a highly

questionable operation,” depending on the kinds of models being applied (Arditi &
Michalski 1996). Not surprisingly, although different versions of aggregation have dif-
ferent effects, in general it reduces the information available from the data (see Abarca-
Arenas & Ulanowicz 2002 for a well-worked example of the Chesapeake Bay trophic
network). The difﬁculties arising from changing levels of aggregation are a surprise to
no one, and certainly no surprise to those familiar with spatial analysis, where the effect

of changing spatial aggregation on the results of analysis is called the “modiﬁable area
unit problem” (Openshaw 1984; see Dale & Fortin 2014, Section 6.3).
An additional complication is that, if the relationship between predators and prey
depends on their phylogenetic histories (see Ives & Godfray 2006), the aggregation
of taxa may blur what might otherwise be clear results. Lastly, when considering the
dynamics of and changes to trophic networks, aggregation of possibly sporadic species
may give an exaggerated impression of persistence and stability where it is actually
absent (cf. Olesen et al. 2011a; Petanidou et al. 2008).
This all sounds bad, doesn’t it? But . . . aggregation may be unavoidable, and it does
have some beneﬁts. While taxonomic aggregation can have a big effect on perceived
structure, it is often not the result of error or lack of effort; it may be unavoidable based
on the limitations of the study, its methodology or its data requirements. Sometimes we
cannot know the taxonomic details. Aggregation may be preferable if it allows a quan-
titative evaluation of the aggregated taxon where that would be impossible with non-
aggregated information. In his discussion of ecological food webs as networks, New-
man (2010) suggested that this aggregation of many similar taxa into “trophic species”
has the beneﬁt of simpliﬁcation, which may be worth the small loss of information. In
addition, in some cases, separate species of forbs, as food plants, may be more similar
for the herbivore in all the functionally important ways than different chemical races of
the same species, especially those based on anti-feedant chemicals (e.g. cyanogenic vs
acyanogenic genotypes; see Jones 1966). An additional factor in the Kluane example,
as in many others, is that anti-feedant chemicals in plants can change through time and
may be induced by herbivory, although their role in driving herbivore (snowshoe hare)
demography in the Kluane system seems to be minor (Hodges et al. as cited in Krebs et
al. 2001).
4.2.3
Trophic Hierarchy
One clear theme in the use of graph-theoretic measures is the evaluation of a general
property of “orderliness” in ecological systems. In the case of trophic networks, one
particular form of orderliness is the degree to which the network has consistent and
clearly deﬁned trophic levels, with each species being unambiguously in one of the well-
deﬁned levels. In the ideal, primary producers (usually plants) occupy trophic level 0,
herbivores (grazers) feed on the plants and thus occupy level 1, those that feed on the
herbivores occupy level 2, and so on (Figure 4.7a), giving exclusive membership in
each level. In real trophic networks, omnivory and other variants of mixed diets that
upset the simple scheme are common (see Figure 4.1), and a number of proposals have
been provided for the calculation of (non-integer) trophic levels for species under such
circumstances (see, among many others, Williams & Martinez 2004; Thompson et al.
2007), whether based on proportion of prey items or on biomass consumption ratios.
Even the bottom level of the hierarchy can add confusion with many bacteria and algae
being mixotrophic, with the ability to use different sources for energy, such as either
light or chemical, photosynthesis or phagotrophy (see Hammer & Pitchford 2005; Eiler
2006). Even among terrestrial plants, there is the ambiguity caused by plants that are

both autotrophic and parasitic: “hemi-parasites” (Smith 2000). Having determined a
hierarchy of trophic levels, even if neither strict nor with consistent integer values, it
may be useful to determine how some of the basic graph statistics vary with level, for
example average degree (in- vs out-degree) or the distribution of node degrees by level.
In a study of the trophic networks of ﬁsh in tropical streams and swamps, Winemiller
(1990) found that the distribution of trophic levels calculated in a trophic continuum
were very similar among systems despite large variation in species compositions; ﬁsh
that fed at more than one trophic interval were “extremely common” in all the networks.
In addition to the question of how to assign appropriate trophic level values in non-
strict trophic networks, another challenge is to provide an appropriate graph-theoretic
measure of how close or how far any trophic network is from the ideal strict hierarchy
(Figure 4.7). That is a question about the orderliness of trophic networks, and there are
more: what are the correlates of greater or less order? Is there predictable variation with
system or geography?
Any questions about the trophic hierarchy of a food web are going to be related to
the food chains in the network, which are the paths of directed edges from the bottom
of the network to the top, and lengths of those chains (and the variance of chain length).
Digraphs of ecological trophic networks are “acyclic,” with no cycles of the directed
edges (see Newman 2010), and some characterization of the nature of the structure
would be useful. In addition to obvious statistics for comparing trophic networks such
as number of species, number of edges and number or proportion of predators, measures
of average chain length, trophic levels and connectance are commonly used (see e.g.
Kitching 2000); but measures of hierarchical orderliness seem to be lacking.
A simple measure is the number of edges that have to be deleted or moved to make
the observed network strictly hierarchical. A second measure would be to use every food

chain lengths would be a suitable statistic. Chain length however, is not the best indica-
tor; Figure 4.9 gives examples of chains in which rank order and trophic levels do not
match, but the chain length is unchanged. Therefore, the suggestion is to use the chain
order rank for each node over all possible food chains to give a variance/mean score,
which can then be averaged over all nodes (Figure 4.10). Obviously, a strict hierarchy
will produce an average of 0, because all nodes in all chains will have a rank equal
to their average trophic level, thus having individual scores of 0. This seems to be an
important measure for trophic network studies because both chain length and omnivory

(or other departures from the textbook model of strict hierarchies) are expected to affect
population and community dynamics (see, among many others, Morin & Lawler 1996),
with omnivory now recognized as common, and weak omnivory recognized as a stabi-
lizing inﬂuence (see Thompson et al. 2007; McCann 2012).
4.2.4
Compartments and Sub-webs
The term “compartments” refers to the separation of a food web into “sub-webs,” within
which many strong interactions take place and between which there are few (Krause et
al. 2003). Compartments in food webs or trophic networks are the equivalent of “mod-
ules” or “clusters” in other applications of graph theory. It is easy to imagine a food
web consisting of two recognizable sub-webs or compartments united by the top level,
or two, of a textbook trophic structure hierarchy. Perhaps the sub-webs are determined
by the phases of a landscape mosaic of forest and grassland, with different plants and
herbivores in the two parts; or perhaps benthic versus planktonic parts of a shallow
marine system (Krause et al. 2003), or lentic versus lotic components of a watershed.
Whatever the basis for the sub-web separation, here the trophic network can be divided
fairly cleanly into two compartments (Figure 4.11, left), unlike those where there is no
clear compartmentalization (Figure 4.11, right). Real trophic networks are not likely to
be cleanly or clearly separable in this way, but this gives rise to the questions of how sep-
arable or how close to being separable into compartments any particular trophic network
actually is (Krause et al. 2003) and how best to measure that property (see Table 4.1 for
one approach). Again, this is the trophic network equivalent of asking how modular or
clustered a given graph of social interactions is. For the function of ecological systems,
however, the most important point is that compartmentalization seems to enhance the
stability and persistence of trophic networks (Teng & McCann 2004; Stouffer & Bas-
compte 2011; see also Thébault & Fontaine 2010; Rozdilsky et al. 2004).

The procedure is to assign the taxa to non-overlapping compartments, but the prior
speciﬁcation of the number of compartments is not required. The odds ratio is AD /
BC and increases in this ratio signal more effective compartments; signiﬁcance is deter-
mined by a Monte Carlo procedure. They used weights for the predation interactions:
interaction frequency, measures of carbon ﬂow (gC m−2 y−1), or interaction strength
(see Neutel et al. 2002), and the software “KliqueFinder” (Frank 1995) to ﬁnd compart-
ments in several versions of each of ﬁve well-documented food webs (Ythan Estuary,
Little Rock Lake, Saint Martin Island, Chesapeake Bay and a cypress wetland; see their
Appendix A for details). The method identiﬁed signiﬁcant compartments in three of the
ﬁve food webs, and the ability to detect compartments was inﬂuenced by food web reso-
lution, such as using interactions with weights, and by taxonomic aggregation. By com-
bining methods from physics for network analysis with phylogenetic statistics, Rezende
et al. (2009) showed that compartments identiﬁed in large marine trophic networks were
associated with body size, phylogenetic relationship and spatial structure.
A closely related concept and approach to characterizing the structure of trophic
networks, and the ﬂow of energy through and within them, is the search for strongly
connected components (Allesina et al. 2005); these are the largest sets of nodes that
are mutually reachable by directed paths in the digraph (Figure 4.12). This is called
Figure 4.12 Strongly connected components: three multi-node components are identiﬁed by
shading. Edges of solid lines are within components; dashed lines are between. Most
components consist of only one node.
.005
15:25:06

4.2 Trophic Network Characteristics

strongly connected because the directions of the edges are taken into account in iden-
tifying a path from node i to node j. This deﬁnition ensures that these components are
node-disjoint, and thus each one is a compartment as well. These components must have
cycles to permit mutual reachability, and so the network is bound to look very different
from the textbook hierarchy like the one in Figure 4.1, in which most strongly connected
components will be individual nodes because cycles of edges are unexpected. Strongly
connected components are an extreme version of the basic concept of the “separabil-
ity” of a food web into compartments. Just as food chains and food chain lengths are
important manifestations of the ﬂow of energy through a food web, strongly connected
components are important structural features related to cycling dynamics in these sys-
tems (Allesina et al. 2005).
An obvious simpliﬁcation of the original network is to replace each strongly con-
nected component by a node in a derived graph with edges showing the ﬂow of energy
between these component nodes. The derived graph is a digraph, but because the com-
ponents are mutually reachable subsets, there can be no directed cycles (making it a
directed acyclic graph). This second level is a graph-of-graphs because its every node
has associated with it a set of nodes and edges from the original. Allesina et al. (2005)
investigated 17 ecosystem food webs and found that each consisted of at least four
strongly connected components. In the four aquatic food webs they investigated in
detail, there was a division between benthic and pelagic sub-communities (see their
Table 1), consistent with the ﬁndings of Krause et al. (2003) for the same or similar
ecosystems.
What has not been addressed is a quantitative measure of the separability of a given
trophic network: the extent to which the food chains can be placed into separate com-
partments or the extent of changes that would make the structure truly separable,
whether by edge deletions or re-assignments, and the number of such changes that are
required.
An approach to this question has, however, been taken using the concept of the k-sub-
web, introduced by Melián and Bascompte (2004). A k-sub-web is a subset of species
each of which is connected to at least k species in the subset, whether predators or
prey (Figure 4.13). That is, extracting the subgraph of those species only, each node
has a total degree (in-degree + out-degree of k or greater, no matter the number of
nodes in the subgraph. The subgraphs are not required to be strongly connected, nor do
all its nodes have to have the same degree total. The authors compiled the frequency
distributions for the k-sub-webs for 12 trophic networks and found that these tend to
be highly skewed, with frequency decaying with k following a power law. They also
focussed on the most dense sub-web in ﬁve of these data sets, and compared its structure
with a number of null models. The structures showed a cohesive organization, with
many small sub-webs highly connected with each other, but through the most dense
sub-web. That study provides a model of the approach that other researchers can follow
in their own investigations.
Not only do trophic networks commonly consist of compartments, it seems that they
also can be built up of highly nested sub-webs rather like those in mutualistic networks.

sub-webs. This suggests that generalist predators’ prey species include some with very
few predators and that specialist predators’ prey species tend to be those with many
different predators, running counter to the maintenance of compartments by creating
overlap of prey species’ predator lists or of predator species’ prey lists. The relationship
between these two tendencies needs to be worked out. (You can do this!)
4.2.5
Keystone Species
A keystone species is one that has a disproportionately large effect on the trophic net-
work or ecosystem in which it occurs, given the species’ density or biomass. Frequently
quoted examples include predators (e.g. sea otters or wolves); herbivores (snowshoe
hare, beaver, elephants); and some plants (ﬁg trees, nitrogen ﬁxing cyanobacteria). From
the graph theory point of view, the important question is whether keystone species can
be detected from their topological position in the trophic network and other graph-
theoretical characteristics. The quick-and-dirty answer is that topology is important, but
other factors must be included to determine the “keystoneness” (Libralato et al. 2006) of
any species. A number of studies have focussed on centrality measures as useful indices
of topological importance of any node in a trophic network (Jordán 2009; Estrada 2007;
Jiang & Zhang 2015), although Libralato et al. (2006) used interaction strength and
biomass in a “sum-of-all-paths” approach (“mixed trophic impact”) to evaluate key-
stoneness in models by including both direct and indirect interactions throughout the
trophic network. This is similar to the centrality measures based on current ﬂow inves-
tigated by Freeman et al. (1991), Borgatti (2005) and Brandes and Fleischer (2005).
Fedor and Vasas (2009) investigated the robustness of 13 different keystone indices
to the addition or deletion of edges in a trophic network. They found that the most

robust were betweenness centrality, already described (Table 3.1); an index of topolog-
ical importance, which looks at indirect effects a number of steps away (Jordán et al.
2006); a keystoneness index that emphasizes vertical, rather than horizontal, interac-
tions; and “mixed trophic impact,” which distinguishes the negative effects of predators
from the positive effects of prey (Jordán et al. 2006).
Although not exactly a graph-theoretic concept, the measurement of mixed trophic
impact seems to be a good complement to measures of topological position (such as
centrality) for identifying keystone species in trophic networks, and it seems to have
achieved some currency in the literature (e.g. Angelini et al. 2010; Gasalla et al. 2010;
Pinkerton & Bradford-Grieve 2014), particularly for marine systems. For such systems,
and particularly for planktonic trophic networks, structure is determined by particle size,
and the individuals of species A can be the prey of species B when they are small and
then a key predator of the same species when they are larger. This greatly increases
the likelihood of cyclic and strongly connected components in the graphs (already dis-
cussed) and it greatly increases the number and complexity of indirect effects for eval-
uating mixed trophic impact in determining keystone species.
This approach begins with estimates of the positive and negative effects between
species or trophic species i and j: gij is the proportion of the diet of j contributed by i
and fij is the proportion of the net production by i that is consumed by j. The net impact
of i on j is then the difference
qij = gij −fij.
(4.1)
These differences are the elements of a n × n matrix Q of the single-step trophic
impacts. Then, the mixed trophic impact matrix M estimates the effects of a small
increase in any node of the trophic network on all the other nodes through all path-
ways, both direct and indirect. For example, an increase in the ﬁrst level of carnivores
can have an indirect positive effect on plant biomass by causing a slight decrease in her-
bivore density; this is the phenomenon known as a “trophic cascade” (cf. Paine 1980),
closely related to the concept of a keystone species, which may be the initiator of the
trophic cascade. The matrix M is derived from the matrix Q as
MT =

I −QT−1 −I.
(4.2)
(I is the identity matrix and T is the matrix transpose.) Positive values of its elements,
mij, indicate an increase of biomass of j in response to small increase in biomass of i;
and negative values indicate a decrease. These n × n values can be used to give a good
visual summary of the net pairwise effects within the trophic network, either with a
grid of single entry bar-charts of positive and negative values (e.g. Angelini et al. 2010)
or a bubble plot with magnitude indicated by circle size and sign indicated by ﬁlled
(black = negative) or empty (white = positive) circles (e.g. Pinkerton & Bradford-
Grieve 2014). A small artiﬁcial example of the latter format is given in Figure 4.14.
The overall importance of any species can be calculated from the elements of M, for

(4.3)
Valls et al. (2015) suggested combining this kind of measure with simple rank by
biomass to emphasize those species with the biggest impact but the smallest biomass.
This is easy to do and their recommended best index is a multiplicative combination of
Libralato’s impact measure with biomass descending rank order.
Figure 4.15 shows the bubble plot of mixed trophic impact for a subset of the func-
tional groups for Prince William Sound (redrawn from Valls et al. 2015). The full 53 ×
53 matrix includes the expected organisms like Orcas and squid, but also less usual func-
tional groups like commercial and recreational ﬁshing ﬂeets. (As an aside, the matrix
seems to have no evidence of a trophic cascade providing positive effects on phyto-
plankton by consumers of herbivorous zooplankton.) When trophic impact was com-
bined with low biomass to give a keystoneness measure, the top two keystone species
were “transient Orcas” and “avian predators” (bald eagle); porpoise and seabirds were
both close to these two in the same quadrant of high trophic impact and lower biomass.
4.2.6
Further Complications: More on Indirect Effects
Predation is obviously the fundamental interaction that determines the structure of
trophic networks, but it also is a key component of a number of interesting and impor-
tant multi-species interactions referred to as “indirect effects,” described in a systematic
format for rocky intertidal communities by Menge (1995). One of these is, of course,
“keystone predation” in which a predator has a positive effect on the competitors of its
preferred prey by reducing the density of that prey species (Figure 4.16a). To describe
these indirect or induced interactions by simple one-way edges depicting ﬂow from prey

to predator is not enough; the two effects, negative on the prey and positive on the preda-
tor need to be made explicit where appropriate (Figure 4.16). A variant of the keystone
predation effect is the “trophic cascade” of a predator allowing higher plant densities
by controlling a herbivore by predation (Figure 4.16b). Two predators that use the same
prey create an induced negative effect on each other by the consumption of that prey;
this is called “exploitation competition” (Figure 4.16c). “Apparent competition” (Figure
4.16d) occurs when one prey species declines in response to increases in another prey
species due to its ability to enhance predators and predation on the ﬁrst species. “Habitat
facilitation” is the positive effect of one predator on another through the reduction of a
prey species which thus inhibits feeding by the second predator (Figure 4.16e); “indirect
inhibition” (or “second level inhibition” or “reversed trophic cascade”) is also based on
feeding inhibition by a plant, which reduces herbivore density thus having a negative
effect on the predator by reducing its prey base (Figure 4.16f); this is a reversed version
of the trophic cascade. Another variation, “apparent predation,” is the indirect defence
that occurs when the plant attracts or supports a predator by chemicals or resources, thus
reducing the effectiveness of herbivores and herbivory on the plant itself (Figure 4.16g).
Two more indirect interactions are illustrated in Figure 4.16h and 4.16i: “indirect mutu-
alism” and “indirect commensalism.” The mutualistic version occurs when two preda-
tors’ densities are positively correlated because they each reduce their own prey species,

releasing the other predator’s prey from competition (Figure 4.16h). Indirect commen-
salism is just an asymmetric version of this same phenomenon (Figure 4.16i), although
the biology of hemiparasitic terrestrial plants allows a range of indirect positive inter-
actions between these plants and their hosts (Smith 2000). The last example does not
involve predation, and that is “indirect facilitation” among three competitors in a single
trophic level: this is the indirect positive effect of a species on another when the sup-
pression of a shared competitor outweighs the direct competitive effect (Levine 1999).
For example, species C would normally out-compete B, driving it to local extinction,
but strong competition from A reduces C, allowing B to persist (Figure 4.16j).
Given the possible importance of these indirect interactions, there are questions aris-
ing. What do you see in your study? Are indirect effects discernible? Most of the meth-
ods for deriving the graph for trophic networks or other interaction networks are based
on observations such as counts, as already described, and so the indirect effects are not
observed. Trophic network positive edges from prey to predator can be seen as repre-
senting food, matter and energy ﬂow; but negative edges from predator to prey represent
population effects: limitation, suppression or control of densities. In general, these can-
not be observed or measured without experimental manipulation of populations (Menge
1995), or the occurrence of “natural experiments” of large ﬂuctuations or removals by
catastrophe or disease, which have problems of interpretation all their own, and ﬁeld
experiments often are focussed on the effects on a single species. Sotomayor and Lortie
(2015) have recently identiﬁed a number of gaps in the research on indirect interactions
in terrestrial plant communities, including studies on interactions that do not involve
feeding and the use of more realistic and complex designs involving several trophic lev-
els. It may seem that graph theory itself may not help so much because the edges may
persist with different weights, and the weights of the nodes (species densities) are key
features and will ﬂuctuate through time. What is important is the dynamics of the sys-
tems portrayed. Treating the subgraphs of Figure 4.16 as motifs to be detected and cat-
alogued may not help because they will be intertwined with other subgraphs, with their
own dynamics. Network theory and the study of dynamic networks and of the dynamics
on networks may help, but this is a complex area of ecological structural studies. This
topic will return in Chapter 11.
Another aspect of trying to include these indirect interactions is that their motifs
rely on the quantitative balance of the weights of the individual edges to determine the
outcome, and the diameters of the motifs considered will also have a profound inﬂuence.
As a simple example, start with the familiar three species, three level trophic cascade
as in Figure 4.16b. Now add a second herbivore . . . what is the effect? It may change
nothing, but it could also cause the indirect positive effect to disappear: with two prey
species, the predator can control neither sufﬁciently, and the plants suffer. From the same
three-species structure, add another plant species; the outcome may depend on herbivore
preferences. If a second predator is included, it may merely reinforce the trophic cascade
effect, or it may dilute it. Adding species to simple diagrams immediately complicates
the dynamics on the subgraphs, and predicting outcomes is very difﬁcult. In addition,
these effects may depend at least in part on the phylogenies of the organisms involved
(see Ives & Godfray 2006).

4 Trophic Networks: Structure, Partitioning and Dynamics
Where’s the graph theory? The graph theory contribution to understanding the impor-
tance of these indirect interactions comes into play with the sum-of-all-paths concept as
well as in the basic understanding of dynamics in trophic network structures. All possi-
ble “ﬂows” of effects through the edges identiﬁed in the system must be considered. It
is difﬁcult to call on graph theory for assistance if the edges of interest are not detected
because the detection methods are based on direct effects. Knowing the structure of
indirect interaction motifs, with and without the edges of the indirect effects, can point
to sections of the system being studied where indirect interactions are likely and should
be looked for.
Graph theory does have a lot to tell us about the complications of indirect effects
when the system is moderately well resolved and with quantitative estimates. Abrams
et al. (1996) describe an example from the Benguela marine ecosystem (South Africa)
focussed on the predatory fur seal and a commercially important ﬁsh, the hake. What
would happen to the hake population density if the fur seals were greatly reduced by
a culling program? It’s not obvious. The seals eat hake and some of their prey, but the
seals also eat some of their competitors and predators. Yodzis used an energy-based
dynamic model of this system (unpublished, cited by Abrams et al. 1996) and enumer-
ated all trophic network paths of lengths up to seven (equivalent to ﬁnding the inverse of
the Jacobian matrix of the network) for 20 versions of models of this system (20 sets of
parameter values), ten with a positive hake response to seal culling and ten with a neg-
ative response. There were many paths to be considered, over a million of length seven,
and the results showed that the effect of seal on hake can be very diffuse. The main mes-
sage from this approach is that we cannot expect to understand the net effect by using a
small subset of the paths, especially only short ones, but that the network model provides
some guidance as to what can be expected based on a fairly well resolved system. The
graph theory approach of examining all paths will include the indirect interactions, even
if it is not done explicitly. The real conclusion for understanding indirect interactions in
trophic networks and in natural communities is that it requires much more information
than we currently have for most trophic networks. This is true even for those that are
well studied, and particularly true for the functional relationships within them (Abrams
et al. 1996). Only with better information will the more powerful applications of graph
theory be able to help fully in evaluating the nature and importance of the role of indirect
interactions in these systems.

Concluding Comments
Trophic networks are hierarchical, but realistically include non-integer trophic levels to
account for omnivory, cannibalism and mixotrophy (and how to ﬁt in resource theft by
hemi-parasites?), and so measures of rank and of rank variance in the food chains are
appropriate for evaluating one kind of layer consistency. These partially ordered net-
works are the graph theory approach to studying the ﬂow of energy through the nodes
of a directed graph and are obviously related to the pyramids of numbers and biomass
of the food web diagrams familiar from text books. Remember “Big Fierce Animals are

Rare”! (Colinvaux 1979; i.e. large carnivores require extensive areas to support them
because of the inefﬁciency of energy transfer through several trophic levels). One obvi-
ous advantage of the use of graphs and graph theory in the analysis of trophic networks
is in the ability to quantify and analyze the hierarchical characteristics of the network.
Characteristics like compartments in the network or separability, if they are found,
allow the examination of some of the detail of the whole network and its composi-
tion from smaller sub-webs, each with a certain amount of autonomy within the hierar-
chical context. On the other hand, strongly connected components indicate something
about cycling within the network of consumers. Keystone species have a disproportion-
ate effect on function, and may be determined from a combination of their topological
position within the network and other features such as ﬂow centrality and measures of
mixed trophic impacts.
Trophic networks, like other systems of ecological interest, occur in space and time,
and their structure and dynamics are affected by both. Trophic network studies or
their summaries often recognize the importance of changes in time (e.g. Schoenly &
Cohen 1991), but less frequently acknowledge place-to-place differences (although see
Careddu et al. 2015) and the critical role played by the spatial structure of the environ-
ment or of the populations involved (Holyoak 2000; Holt 2002; Pillai et al. 2009). In
particular, the interactions in trophic networks are constrained by local extinctions and
recolonization events, and obviously have their own effects on those processes (Huf-
faker 1958). Trophic network dynamics cannot be fully separated from trophic network
structure, nor from the spatial structuring of their environment, and so an understanding
of those processes requires an integration of metacommunity research and trophic net-
work knowledge at both the detailed and theoretical levels (see Holt & Hoopes 2005).
Graphs and graph theory provide the means by which to analyze and quantify these
details, whether by measures like modularity and centrality, through modelling dynamic
digraphs with elements of self-organization, or in the use of graphs-of-graphs and the
comparison of their subgraphs. There are many possibilities to be explored.
The “to do” list for applying graph theory to trophic network ecology therefore
involves determining such features of the trophic network structure: How compartmen-
talized? How truly hierarchical? How critical are keystone species? What characteristics
enhance or diminish stability? What kind of node or edge centrality is most predictive?
What structural features determine the dynamics on the trophic network? How does
the spatial structure of the environment and of the community affect trophic network
dynamics? What characteristics most affect the dynamics of the trophic network, as it
changes with season, succession or external forces?
Looking at examples, and comparing terrestrial and marine ecosystems, it seems that
planktonic and open water trophic networks may differ from others, and mostly in the
fact that their structure is determined by particle and body size, rather than by anything
else. As the individuals of one species, call it A, grow in size, they can switch from
being the prey of another species, call it B, to functioning as an important predator.
For example, copepods may be the key prey of larger ﬁsh, but predators of the larvae
of the same species. In addition, mixotrophy may be much more common as a mode
of nutrition in aquatic systems, with many organisms that are facultatively autotrophic

and heterotrophic (see e.g. Eiler 2006). This fact has two important implications for the
trophic networks as studied with graph theory. The ﬁrst is that this greatly increases the
likelihood of cyclic and strongly connected components in the graphs. The second is
that it greatly increases the number and complexity of indirect effects for mixed trophic
impacts and thus the importance of indirect effects in determining the keystoneness of
species.
Studies of trophic networks, perhaps more than any other ecological endeavours,
illustrate the inter-gradation of observational and experimental studies and modelling.
This is especially true of attempts to understand the relationship between graph-
theoretical characteristics, such as the general topology of connections, and the dynamic
responses of the networks, such as robustness or stability. For example, McCann (2012)
described a model trophic network that consists of two compartments of ﬁve nodes each,
and what happened when the maximal set of 25 edges between the compartments were
varied from strong to weak, or were removed one by one. The two manipulations did
not produce the same result: starting with all edges, removal led to a decline in stability
with an eventual return to the initial value when no edges were left, but the progressive
decline in interaction strength produced a series of peaks and valleys in stability that
had no immediate intuitive interpretation (see his Figures 10.4 and 10.5). The complex
but fascinating topic of the relationship between network topology and network dynam-
ics will be taken up again in greater detail in Chapter 11, but in trophic networks it
has critical implications for our understanding of stability and resilience. It is not to be
expected that the same structural characteristics of networks that provide or enhance
stability for one interaction (e.g. mutualistic networks) will do the same in others (e.g.
trophic networks), as shown by Thébault and Fontaine (2010), and it is not clear what
the implications would be for networks that include more than one kind of interaction.
A further critical advantage, however, of using graph theory in trophic network stud-
ies is related to the need to go beyond looking at trophic networks in isolation from
other inter-speciﬁc interactions, if only to understand the trophic networks! This point
needs repeated emphasis, I think, but it is clearly expressed in several reviews (Abrams
et al. 1996; Bukovinszky et al. 2008; Ings et al. 2008; Ohgushi 2008; Sotomayor &
Lortie 2015; Kéﬁet al. 2015). The shared prey and shared predator graphs (Figure 4.2)
derived from the original trophic network indicate good places to start to identify the
existence and strengths of indirect interactions; but the other “direct” ecological inter-
actions, of competition, facilitation, mutualism and parasitism may need to be included
also to varying degrees depending on the system. From the graph theory point of view,
the inclusion of a range of different ecological interactions will necessitate a revised sys-
tem for identifying which edges depict which kinds; in turn, different classes of edges
will require some modiﬁcations of the usual measures and tests of graph structure. This
complex and engaging topic deserves further attention, with graph theory as an essential
analytical approach.

Species Associations, Communities
and Graphs of Social Structure
Introduction
When you look up “social networks” on the Web, you ﬁnd many references to human
social networks that use basic graphs to depict the structure of relationships, with nodes
being individuals and undirected unweighted edges between them representing contact
or positive afﬁliation, such as trust or friendship (Figure 5.1). In fact, however, social
relationships between individuals are usually asymmetric in two important ways, as
illustrated in Chapter 1 with comments about children in a playground. First, while the
quality of the relationship may be similar for both, they may be unequal: individuals A
and B like each other, but B considers A to be their very best friend, and A feels less
strongly and does not consider B to be theirs (Figure 5.2a). Second, the interactions can
be positive or negative, as when A likes and trusts B, but dislikes and distrusts C (Figure
5.2b). I have used the relationship of “trust” here in a naïve way, but the concept has
taken on a technical meaning and a more technical treatment in the network literature
related to security of communications particularly for e-commerce (see Beth et al. 1994;
Guha et al. 2004, and references therein; Leskovec et al. 2010; Agresti et al. 2015).
Having signs allows the relationship between individuals of a pair to be contradictory
or conﬂicted with opposite signs for two relationships, and social instability often arises
in that situation (Figure 5.2c). The graphs for these social relationships, therefore, need
to incorporate asymmetries both of sign and of quantity, and so it is not surprising that
graphs for relationships among species in a community have the same requirement, as
do any of the other “social” relationships that occur in ecological studies.
From simple undirected unweighted graphs, including these asymmetries lead us to
modify the graphs for depicting and studying social structure to signed digraphs with
the following characteristics:
Starting with
r nodes have labels indicating the individual identity or category; their positions in a
drawing of the graph have no meaning but are chosen for convenience and clarity;
r simple edges that join nodes in pairs without direction, sign or weight, but they allow
the detection of clusters of highly connected nodes;
Then
r edges have directions distinguish A to B from B to A, allowing the properties of
reciprocity and transitivity;

This chapter describes some of the smart things that graph theory can help with in
ecological studies of “social interactions” such as the phytosociological structure of
plant communities or the social dynamics of animal groups. These are often based
on concepts from human sociology and, more recently, from technologically enhanced
social networks (“social media”), Internet commerce and other networks of information
technology.

Graphs of Social Structure
5.1.1
Communities
One source of confusion for this chapter is the inconsistent use of the term “commu-
nity.” Ecologists use the term to refer to all individuals and all species (of interest) found
at a particular location at a particular time. Therefore the digraph of a plant community
includes all the plant species and all interactions detected. Unfortunately, in the language
of general network analysis, a “community” is a subgraph of the graph of the whole sys-
tem, in which the nodes are more highly connected or more positively connected than the
graph as a whole, or in which the nodes are perceived to interact as functional subunits.
A serious confusion indeed! Since this is a book for ecologists, it is probably best to
stick with the ecological usage for “community,” and to ﬁnd another term for the highly
interacting subgraphs. They can be called “clusters” although the term is not perfect,
but it does ﬁt also with usage in some network literature. For example, Newman (2010)

of this choice is that “cluster analysis” is an analytical procedure by which dendrograms
(“cluster diagrams”) are derived from multivariate data. However, the concepts are
similar, and so the parallel may be acceptable, if “cluster detection” is carefully speci-
ﬁed. The matching dual of cluster detection in graphs is partitioning, which has parallels
with cluster analysis because partitioning usually has the goal of dividing a graph into
groups of nodes with the fewest (positive) connections between groups and the most
within. For example, the graph in Figure 5.1 (with only positive edges) can be divided
into two clusters with many connections within and only one between: {A, B, H, G}
and {C, D, E, F}. This criterion is very similar to that used for the detection of clus-
ters in multivariate data by divisive techniques, that start with the whole collection of
objects and divide it recursively with “minimum similarity between; maximum similar-
ity within.” When the edges have signs associated with them, the deﬁnitions need to be
modiﬁed for clarity: the partitioning of the graph into clusters is to maximize the posi-
tive edges within clusters and maximize the negative edges between them or minimize
the positive edges between. A graph that is perfectly balanced can always be partitioned
into such clusters (Harary 1953; see Newman 2010, Section 7.11).
(As an aside, when dealing with spatial graphs, the clusters detected by “within
versus between” algorithms lead to the identiﬁcation of a nested hierarchy of spatial
clusters. These can be used, in turn, as spatial patches, the spatial extents of which
can then be used as the basis for determining spatial scale of the spatial structure [the
patches and the inter-patch gaps]. This approach is very similar to a number of methods
for the detection of spatial scale in patterns of point events [see Dale & Fortin 2014,
Chapter 3].)
The conclusion is that the term “community” will follow the ecological deﬁnition,
and the structure of graphs of these systems will be investigated by detecting “clus-
ters” as subgraphs but also by studying other characteristics of the graphs based on the
signs and quantities associated with the edges. Properties of these structures that will
be of interest include the transitivity of the relationships portrayed by the edges and the
sociological balance of the smaller subgraphs (the consistency of relationships among
positive and negative associations).
5.1.2
Plants and Animals
It would be easy to start with the generalization that, in graphs of the social networks
of plants, the nodes are usually species, whereas in graphs of the social networks of
animals, the nodes are usually individuals. There are obvious exceptions, for example,
the spatial graphs of tree stems study plants at the level of the individual, and studies
of coral reef dynamics may focus on the turnover of species through time, not individ-
uals, but for the purposes of this chapter let us at least start with this generalization.
In defence of this starting point, plants are usually ﬁxed and so interactions between
them depend on their relative locations and may be mediated by their effects on light,
moisture, nutrients, chemicals and so on. The positive interactions between plants may
always need to be balanced by their shared need for the same resources, so that there
is a tension between any “facilitation” (mutual or one-way beneﬁts through effects on
.006
15:26:21

5.1 Graphs of Social Structure

moisture, nutrient release, protection from herbivory) and the background of compe-
tition for shared resources. That facilitation and its balance with competition may be
both ﬂuid, in that it changes through time or with circumstances such as moisture or
nutrient regime, and diffuse, in that it may affect a number of species with various
degrees of effectiveness and not obviously a one-on-one focussed pairwise interaction.
The changing nature of an inter-speciﬁc relationship in plant communities can pro-
vide different interpretations of common motifs in such networks. For example, the
apparently contradictory structure of “A likes B; B dislikes A” in the social context
(Figure 5.2c), may be an indication that species A is a positive inﬂuence on species
B because it acts as a “nurse plant” when the plants of B are small, but when they
grow up, they then tend to shade out the species A plants, creating the negative edge
in Figure 5.2c. In addition, while many discussions of indirect interactions between
species focus on those related to trophic networks, there are some that affect the rela-
tionships between plants (see Figure 4.16d apparent competition and 4.16j indirect
facilitation).
Because most animals can move, while the same kinds of facilitative and more diffuse
interactions may occur (shared vigilance against predators, physical sheltering, environ-
mental engineering by beavers or elephants), the more obvious interactions are more
direct. These may involve movement and contact (habitual physical proximity, joint
foraging, grooming, aggression, mating, disease transmission and so on), or commu-
nication by visual or audible signals. Social network analysis for animals is therefore
most usually individual-based, and often focussed on social behaviour (Krause et al.
2007; Wey et al. 2008; Farine & Whitehead 2015). As another version of the same over-
generalization, one could suggest that terrestrial plants explore and sample their envi-
ronment by having many individuals (think of all those seedlings and Harper’s “envi-
ronmental sieve”; Harper 1977) whereas animals like birds and mammals explore and
sample their environment with fewer individuals that move. This difference is a partial
explanation of the greater emphasis on species-level interactions in plant ecology and
individual-level studies for animals, but of course there are exceptions. Plant popula-
tion ecology is well known for its emphasis on studying the fates of individuals (Harper
1977) and trophic network studies (Chapter 4) look more at species and guilds, although
species-level inclusive studies of non-trophic interactions are becoming more prevalent
(see Kéﬁet al. 2015).
In Newman’s (2010) book on networks, social networks are introduced with an exam-
ple from the 1930s depicting friendships in a class of schoolchildren originally drawn
by Jacob Moreno. It is clearly a graph, then called a “sociogram,” with triangles as
nodes for boys and circles as nodes for girls, with edges indicating friendships, almost
all between two boys or two girls. In fact, many of the edges have direction indicated,
because the question on which the graph was based was one of preferences of asso-
ciation, friendships that were not necessarily fully reciprocal or even partially so. The
structure reveals a social hierarchy, with some individuals preferred by many, and others
sought by none. The structure is based on positive preferences, but ecological studies
often need to include the “negative preferences” as well, the equivalent of the factor of
social avoidance.

As discussed in Chapter 1, the data on which these ecological community graphs are
usually based on counts of some kind: counts of plant individuals in quadrats, counts
of contact neighbours, counts of pollinator visits or counts of communication events.
Because basic graphs depict pairwise relationships between nodes, it makes sense to
start with examining pairwise associations of species for whatever interactions are of
interest. In plant community ecology, we often look at the spatial association of pairs of
species based on co-occurrence in sample units (quadrats) or based on physical contact.
With simple count data of s species in n quadrats, for any pair of species, A and B, the
numbers of quadrats which contain each of the four possible combinations of presence
and absence are enumerated in a 2 × 2 contingency table (Table 5.1).
The data are evaluated with the X 2 or G statistic and the χ2 distribution comparing
observed and expected frequencies. A signiﬁcant result is interpreted as positive asso-
ciation between the species if ad > bc and a negative association if ad < bc. Usually all
s(s −1)/2 pairs of species are tested, although there are problems with lack of indepen-
dence among the tests (Dale et al. 1991). Admitting the lack of independence, the useful
product of the analysis is a graph of s nodes with solid line edges joining pairs that are
signiﬁcantly positively associated and broken or dotted line edges joining pairs that are
signiﬁcantly negatively associated (such as Figure 5.3b). These edges are symmetric
for simple quadrat count data, but different sampling schemes such as “point-contact”
sampling, or sampling between deﬁned vegetation layers, can produce asymmetric data,
and thus edges with directions as well as signs. Different sampling designs may require
a different approach to the analysis; for example “point-contact sampling” (see de Jong
et al. 1983), and the basic approach of the many 2 × 2 tables has been extended to an
evaluation of k × k frequency tables of the k most frequent species (or broader cate-
gories) or even multi-way 2k tables. For analysis using graph-theoretical properties, the
aim is usually to evaluate the relationship between each pair of species, often requir-
ing the use of the Freeman-Tukey standardized residual to identify the most aberrant
cells of a contingency table, and to indicate the outcome in an association graph (or
“constellation diagram”) of s (or k) nodes, with edges indicating the most “signiﬁcant”
positive and negative pairwise associations (Figure 5.3b). The positions of the nodes
in the diagram have no meaning, but are chosen for clarity and convenience. In some
applications, the nodes’ positions can be determined by the species coordinates result-
ing from a complementary ordination, but personal experience suggests that this does

not guarantee either clarity or convenience. For example, if the identiﬁcation of clusters
of species is an important feature, it is best to arrange the nodes so that the clusters
are obvious (Figure 5.3b shows three almost exclusive clusters although there are two
positive edges between the clusters, as indicated). The obvious next step is to look at
the characteristics of this species association graph, however derived and whether with
symmetric or directed edges. The following list suggests of some of the smart things we
can do with such graphs.
The (Smart) Things to Do
r Find clusters:
b Using the positive edges, this is the “standard” approach, with many methods.
b Using both positive and negative edges, some adaptation of techniques is
required.
r Find key nodes (often functionally key species or socially key individuals) in struc-
ture:
b With basic edges, indicated by high positive degree.
b With signed directed edges, indicated by high positive and high negative out-
degree.
r Identify and characterize individual nodes with unusual properties, such as char-
acteristics of the sizes of reachable sets as a function of path length.
r Measure reciprocity in a digraph or a signed digraph, where it is appropriate: given
a signiﬁcant association of A with B, is the association of B with A the same sign
and same strength?
r Measure triad completion in a digraph or a signed digraph (and in subgraphs):
given signiﬁcant associations of A with B and B with C, is A also associated with
C or C with A? The proportion of completed triads is also termed the “cluster
coefﬁcient,” easily confused with other terms containing “cluster,” alas.
r Measure transitivity in a digraph or a signed digraph (and in subgraphs): given
signiﬁcant associations of A with B and B with C, is A also associated with C?
This is different from the association of C with A, which creates an intransitive tri-
angle. Lack of transitivity may be related to the difference often observed between
pattern and process.
r Measure balance in a signed graph (and in its subgraphs): the proportion of cycles
with an even number of negative edges, reﬂecting the extent to which “friends’
enemies are enemies” and “friends’ friends are friends” . . . This will have dif-
ferent interpretations in different kinds of graphs, and depending on whether the
nodes represent species or individuals.
r Determine the effects of environmental conditions on these interaction graphs.
For example, how does the structure of an association network change along an
environmental gradient or when moisture or fertilizer is added?
.006
15:26:21

112
5 Species Associations, Communities and Graphs of Social Structure
r How extensive are the changes to the network when a species is lost or a new
species is introduced? Determine which characteristics change and how “far” or
how extensively in the network changes are felt.
One motivation for some of the “to do” list is the attempt to distinguish causes of
inter-speciﬁc association as determined from the relative positions of plants of dif-
ferent species. There is a distinction between (a) “ecological coincidence” (positive
or negative) where the plants of different species are found together or apart because
of shared or divergent ecological requirements and capabilities, and (b) “ecological
inﬂuence” (positive or negative) where the plants of one species have a sufﬁciently
strong effect on local environmental conditions that they change the probability that
plants of the other species will be found in proximity (Dale 1977a). Within the limi-
tations of detection, coincidence should result in graph structures that are reciprocal
(symmetric) and weakly transitive (decaying with the path length) where edges are
of the same sign. On the other hand, inﬂuence is asymmetric and not reciprocal,
and unlikely to be transitive except in special circumstances. Dale (1977a) provided
guidance to interpreting association graphs from plant communities based on such
principles, illustrated in Dale (1977b), but I will not repeat that material here. In
some sampling schemes, associations at very short distances where the plants are
touching may be interpreted as confounding inﬂuence and coincidence, with slightly
greater spatial lags and no touching being mainly coincidence (see Dale 1982). That,
however, is not a general solution to distinguishing the two and depends on spe-
cial circumstances in the physical structure of the plants as well as the sampling
regime.
This list is phrased in terms suitable for plant communities, but it can also be
interpreted more generally for other examples of “social” association structure. The
items in this “to do” list are not all independent. In fact, Newman and Park (2003)
suggest that some of the common features of social networks, positive node degree
correlation (often negative in other network graphs), and a greater than expected
cluster coefﬁcient (triad completion) can be attributed to the prevalence of internal
group structure (clusters). That makes the detection of these internal groupings a
high priority, and, having detected groupings with a range of sizes and exclusiv-
ity, to determine which of them have characteristics that seem “signiﬁcant” or most
extreme in the distribution of the values expected. Remember that there is a long his-
tory of work on evaluating the signiﬁcance of species clusters in association analysis,
which have implications for our understanding clusters in graphs (e.g. Strauss 1982).
To determine “greater than expected” for most of these characteristics of social net-
work graphs, hypothesis testing or evaluation is best carried out by randomization
procedures, whether node label permutation, edge position rearrangement, or (where
applicable) shufﬂing group membership designations (see Chapter 1; cf. Croft et al.
2011).

5.2
Cluster Detection in Graphs and Networks
5.2.1
Why?
Cluster detection has the obvious goal of identifying meaningful subgraphs within a
graph of social structure, and often the delineation of hierarchical structure within the
larger graph. In a useful general review of cluster detection (“community detection”),
Fortunato (2010) has provided some examples of the importance of this kind of analy-
sis. For example, in appropriate business network applications, clusters of Web clients or
of commercial customers may reﬂect similar interests, which can than allow improved
or more focussed service to those customers. In the phytosociological graphs of plant
communities, clusters may reﬂect ecological groupings such as shade-tolerant versus
shade-intolerant forbs in a savanna, or zonal associations of species on an environmen-
tal gradient, such as the marine algae on rocky intertidal shores (see Dale 1984, 1986).
The zonation example provides a clear illustration of the trade-off between facilitation
(mutual beneﬁt of reduced desiccation of species growing close together) and competi-
tion (access to light reduced by neighbours’ shade). In general, the structural relation-
ships among clusters detected within the network graph provides information on the
functional relationships among the species represented by the nodes, and the positions
of nodes within or between clusters and the topological relationships can indicate the
key species in the community dynamics (keystone species; Paine 1969). Knowing that
plant communities change through time means that it may be worthwhile to look in the
social interaction graph for indications of what changes are most likely to occur (as will
be discussed below.)
In animal social networks, deﬁning social groups is often a key step in studying
sociality, identifying important individuals and their structural roles, determining the
characteristics of stable groups, quantifying some anthropogenic effects on animals,
and understanding disease transmission in natural populations (Wey et al. 2008). As
one example, a clear relationship between social network structure and parasite load
and associated diseases has been found for a territorial reptile by Godfrey et al. (2010)
and I’m sure that this kind of relationship between social network position and aspects
of ﬁtness are very common. In fact, the identiﬁcation of clusters of nodes in a network
also allows the classiﬁcation of those nodes according to their positions in the clusters,
which may determine or reﬂect their functional role in the cluster and the effect on
control and stability; an important part of network analysis is the relationship between a
nodes’ functional role and its position in structural subgraphs, which will be investigated
more in Chapter 11. It is usual to think that most disease transmission is a consequence
of social interactions, but there are also the positive effects of information transmission
on potential ﬁtness, such as the culturally derived beneﬁts of learned tool use in chim-
panzees (Hobaiter et al. 2014). Whether positive or negative, the social structure and its
clusters are key to understanding the functional role for these effects.
In rare cases, animal social structure turns out to be hierarchical and well deﬁned
as multi-level. One example is the population of sperm whales in the Eastern Paciﬁc,
which is organized into a higher level of clans uniﬁed by similar patterns of clicks used

for communication (the “coda”); each clan consists of a number of social units to which
individual animals belong (see Cantor et al. 2015) (Figure 5.4). In such a case, the
original network can be reworked as a graph-of-graphs with each cluster reduced to a
single node; the edges between these cluster nodes can be based on rules of combining
the information used for the original edges, and then used to study the relationships
among the structures. In some cases, as in the sperm whale example from Cantor et al.
(2015) sketched in Figure 5.4, the edges between the cluster nodes are actually based
on different information, but that opportunity will be rare. In addition, a hierarchical
approach to cluster identiﬁcation allows us to study the hierarchical structure of the
original graph, examining the contributions of smaller clusters to larger clusters, as they
are formed. In particular, harking back to a discussion in Chapter 2, it can be determined
whether larger groups are formed by the aggregation of subgroups of similar sizes, or
whether larger groups are formed by the accretion of very small subgroups or of single
nodes one by one.
5.2.2
How?
To detect and then to evaluate clusters in graphs, there are many, many methods avail-
able. It is not appropriate to describe them all nor to dwell on the algorithmic details, but
a short summary of a few may be helpful. More specialized references (e.g. Newman
2010, Chapter 11; Fortunato 2010; see also Malliaros & Vazirgiannis 2013) give more
detailed advice and include more methods.

5.2.3
Basic Graphs: Edges without Sign or Direction
Cluster Detection
Most ecologists are familiar with a range of methods generally called “cluster analy-
sis” or “numerical classiﬁcation” that are part of the toolbox of multivariate analysis,
particularly as applied to ecological communities. All are based on a measure of sim-
ilarity or dissimilarity between the objects or groupings of the objects under study. In
most applications to graph-theoretical analysis, the nodes are the primary objects that
are the subject of any clustering approach. The methods themselves, and their algo-
rithms, can be classiﬁed by several criteria, such as sequential versus simultaneous,
agglomerative versus divisive, monothetic versus polythetic, and so on (see Legendre
& Legendre 2012, Chapter 8; Kent & Coker 1992, Chapter 8). Sequential approaches
apply a repeated series of operations to the data, and may be agglomerative, starting
with the objects being treated as separate entities which are then combined into larger
and larger groupings, or divisive, starting with all objects in one big group which then
gets divided into smaller and smaller sub-groupings. Hierarchical methods are those
that provide sequences of smaller-within-larger groupings, which are often depicted by
dendrograms (see Chapter 2); these usually produce non-overlapping groupings at each
level of the hierarchy. Non-hierarchical methods produce a single partition of the whole
set of objects into groupings, again usually non-overlapping, but possibly with overlap,
allowing a single object to belong to more than one cluster. I suggest that the cluster
analysis methods with which most ecologists are most familiar are ones that are sequen-
tial, agglomerative and hierarchical, such as unweighted arithmetic average clustering,
also known as UPGMA for “unweighted paired group method with arithmetic averag-
ing” (again see Legendre & Legendre 2012, Chapter 8).
Minimum Cut Size
This method begins by dividing the whole network into the desired number of sub-
groupings, say two, of the required sizes, say approximately equal. The cut size is the
number of edges between the clusters. Pairs of nodes in different clusters are chosen and
exchanged between clusters if the exchange reduces the cut size. This process is iterated
according to one of a number of different speciﬁc rules until a ﬁnal conﬁguration is
reached. The basic version of this approach is the Kernighan-Lin algorithm (Kernighan
& Lin 1970). As an example, the graph in Figure 5.1 can be divided into two “good”
clusters by cutting edge AC.
Betweenness Centrality
This method resembles minimum cut size in some ways. Rather than cut size as the
criterion, it uses the measure of betweenness, which is a value associated with each
edge based on the number or proportion of geodesic paths that go through it (paths
with the fewest edges), as described in Chapter 3. The method proceeds by removing
the edges with the highest betweenness values one at a time, with recalculations after
each removal, until the graph is divided into two groups, then into three and so on. One
.006
15:26:21

116
5 Species Associations, Communities and Graphs of Social Structure
particular version of this approach is the Girvan-Newman algorithm (Girvan & Newman
2002), which is not as fast as some other algorithms, but which gives a full hierarchical
decomposition of the network, as in a dendrogram (Newman 2010, Section 11.11.1).
Modularity
As with minimum cut size and betweenness centrality, this one uses a single metric
which is then maximized in the ﬁnal cluster conﬁguration. Modularity is essentially the
proportion of edges that are within identiﬁed clusters, rather than between. With Figure
5.1 as the example, 10 of the 11 edges occur within clusters, and only 1 between. Again,
this kind of measure will be familiar to ecologists from the context of multivariate clus-
ter analysis. The strength of the clustering is determined by comparing the proportion of
edges within identiﬁed clusters with the proportion expected in randomly constructed
graphs with the same numbers of nodes and edges (Newman & Girvan 2004).
Spectral Methods
Different authorities use different classiﬁcations for the methods for cluster detection,
and the list so far is certainly not exhaustive. There is a set of methods referred to as
“spectral” (e.g. spectral clustering or spectral optimization), which use the Laplacian
matrix of the graph (the degree matrix minus the adjacency matrix). Chapter 1 brieﬂy
introduced the concept of spectral graph theory, which is based on the eigenvectors and
the related “spectrum” of eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix, the Laplacian or another
matrix to represent a graph. In particular, the adjacency matrix A for a simple graph
has one wherever there is an edge between nodes i and j and 0s elsewhere. The degree
matrix, D, has 0s everywhere but on the main diagonal, which contains the degree of
node i as element dii. The Laplacian, L, is then D – A. Some derivations are based on
the normalized Laplacian L = D−1/2 A D−1/2 but the general approach of using the
eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix of either form, is the
same.
Spectral partitioning is a process to divide a graph into two subsets of n1 and n2
nodes, with the cut size being the number of edges between the two partitioned subsets
of nodes. Newman (2010) describes the process of spectral partitioning as follows:
1 Based on the spectrum of eigenvalues of L, calculate the eigenvector corresponding
to the second smallest eigenvalue (called the “algebraic connectivity”).
2 Order the elements of that eigenvector from largest to smallest.
3 The nodes of the graph corresponding to the n1 largest elements are put in partition
group 1, and the rest in group 2; calculate the cut size.
4 Then, the nodes corresponding to the n1 smallest elements are put in group 1, and the
rest in group 2; recalculate the cut size.
5 Of steps (3) and (4), choose the partition that gives the smaller cut size.
Although this algorithm does not guarantee the best partition (however deﬁned), it has
the advantages of being fast and practicable for very large graphs of hundreds of thou-
sands of nodes (Newman 2010). For our purposes, the important feature may be that
.006
15:26:21

5.2 Cluster Detection in Graphs and Networks
117
an analogous method detects clusters in graphs, using modularity as the criterion rather
than cut size.
Other Methods
There are also methods based on possibly overlapping “cliques” of nodes (subgraphs
of all mutually adjacent nodes), which may have less application in ecology than in
computer science or information network analysis. For the ecologist, while theoretical
or technical advantages and disadvantages will always be important considerations in
choosing an approach, the availability of software that is not too difﬁcult to implement
will also be a consideration. This is an area of active investigation in studies of networks
and algorithms for analysis, but this short outline should help point researchers in the
right direction for their purposes, however much “the devil is in the details.”
5.2.4
Signed Graphs
In a signed graph, an edge is not just an edge. (!) A cut-set or the set of edges between
two identiﬁed clusters means something very different depending on whether the edge
is positive or negative. It may be very satisfactory to have two clusters in a graph with
only positive edges within clusters and only negative edges between them. In graphs of
real networks, that ideal is unlikely, but an achievable goal is to consider algorithms that
minimize positive edges between and negative edges within the clusters created. It is
easy to imagine changes to methods developed for positive edges that take advantage
having both negative and positive edges. The graph in Figure 5.3b has only two edges
(marked by ∗) between what would otherwise be perfect clusters with only positive
edges within and only negative edges between. Only two edges therefore, or only one
node, need to be cut to achieve a complete partition. At a more technical level, Kunegis
et al. (2010) provided details on how a somewhat modiﬁed version of graph spectral
analysis can be used for clustering procedures in signed graphs; see also Kunegis (2014)
on applications of structural balance algorithms for social networks: triangles versus
global measures (more will be said about balance in Section 5.4).
5.2.5
Digraphs
In a digraph, an edge has direction, and so, as for signed graphs, edges are not all the
same, and a cluster detection algorithm would do well to include that information in
its process, as appropriate. To treat these edges as if they were symmetric and to pro-
ceed with the basic methods would throw away potentially important information and
the simplistic approach and the results could be misleading or unsatisfactory; for exam-
ple, spectral clustering methods based on the Laplacian matrix (see Chapter 1) cannot
be easily applied to the directed case because the matrices are asymmetric (Malliaros
& Vazirgiannis 2013). Malliaros and Vazirgiannis (2013) provide a very useful classi-
ﬁcation scheme of cluster detection methods for digraphs, and again, there are more
.006
15:26:21

118
5 Species Associations, Communities and Graphs of Social Structure
than need to be described here. The principal approaches are the following (see their
Figure 4):
1 Naïve graph transformation (i.e. ignore directions).
2 Transformations maintaining directionality (to unipartite weighted graph or to bipar-
tite graph).
3 Extending objective functions and methods to digraphs (includes modularity and cut-
based measures).
4 Alternative approaches (includes information theory and probabilistic models).
Of these, purely for comparison with undirected graphs, consider the changes required
for the spectral approach based on the second eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix. For
directed graphs, the Laplacian matrix that is suitable for this purpose must be modiﬁed
from that for undirected graphs to be called Ld (for details, see also Malliaros & Vazir-
giannis 2013). As for non-directed graphs, it is the second smallest non-zero eigenvalue
that is used, and its eigenvector is used to create a good (but not necessarily the best)
partition of the graph into two parts. Several variants of this algorithm are available,
with different modiﬁcations of the matrices and their spectra used, but the technical
details of the differences are not appropriate here. Cluster detection is complicated from
a computational point of view, but it is clearly and obviously a smart thing for ecolo-
gists to do with digraphs of social structure of almost any kind, and worth pursuing for
this kind of data, even when very large. Our example, in Figure 5.3a, which mimics the
naïve graph of Figure 5.1, is overly simple, requiring the removal of only one weakly
positive directed edge (C to A) to produce two separate clusters.
5.2.6
Clusters of Edges not Nodes
The preceding discussion has dealt with the detection of clusters of nodes under a vari-
ety of circumstances, especially under the conditions of different kinds of edges (signed
or not, directed or not, weighted or not). It is also possible, and sometimes advisable,
to study the graphs or networks by looking for clusters based on the edges, rather than
on the nodes (Ahn et al. 2010), producing what they refer to as “link communities.”
The reason offered is that nodes usually represent entities such as individuals or clas-
siﬁcation units (like species) and therefore tend to form different kinds of relationships
with other entities, based on what they have in common (or not). For example, the same
plant species will have different relationships with the other species of its regional ﬂora
depending on the criteria or sampling method used, and will therefore be a member of
a number of overlapping clusters of species, possibly based on phylogeny, functional
group, habitat preference, growth form, herbivore resistance and so on. The approach is
based on the creation of a line graph of the original network of interest, and that concept
has been described elsewhere (Chapter 1).
The method begins with a measure of similarity between any pair of edges that share
a node, call them eik and ejk, based on the set of ﬁrst-order neighbour nodes of node i,
designated n+(i) and the equivalent set for node j, n+(j) (both sets include the shared

the number in their union:

(see Figure 5.5a). This similarity measure can be used as weights for the edges of what
is called the “line graph” of the original network, in which the edges become the new

nodes, and the new edges reﬂect shared nodes in the original (see Chapter 1). An exam-
ple is given in Figure 5.5b, being the line graph of Figure 5.5a. Based on this similarity
measure, single-linkage hierarchical cluster analysis creates a dendrogram of the edges
(Figure 5.5c) and a threshold value delimits the edge clusters. In this simple example,
the identiﬁed clusters of edges (Figure 5.5d) mirror the obvious node clusters, and the
structure is so clear that the results are robust for a range of threshold values. In the
context of metabolic reaction networks, the technique of transforming the original net-
work to its line graph has been used to investigate the scaling laws of these hierarchical
networks (Nacher et al. 2004); a similar approach may prove useful in the more complex
ecological networks.
Using the edges as the unit for cluster deﬁnition allows the identiﬁcation of more
appropriate clusters accounting for this kind of overlap and without “penalizing” nodes
for belonging to more than one cluster (Ahn et al. 2010). The suggestion is that the link
community approach can incorporate overlaps while revealing hierarchical organization
in a way that is superior to node-focussed methods. It will take more research and more
examples to reveal to what extent this claim is true, but it is certainly a good idea to try
this approach and to compare the results with the more usual cluster detection methods.
5.2.7
Clustering More Generally Considered: Assortative and Disassortative Structuring
Ecologists who are familiar with multivariate analysis are used to cluster analysis tech-
niques of various kinds: hierarchical groupings of the primary objects are produced
based on one or more characteristics on which some measure of similarity or dissimi-
larity can be based. The objects are joined into ever-larger groupings based on greatest
and then decreasing similarity, with the most similar being joined ﬁrst. A parallel con-
cept comes from the study of social networks: homophily is the tendency of edges to
be found between nodes that are similar in qualitative or quantitative characteristics.
For example, people might tend to associate with others of similar educational back-
ground, or similar economic status, and this will be evident in a graph of inter-individual
associations based on surveyed opinion or observations of behaviour. This concept can
be generalized by determining whether any given graph is assortative for a particular
character, meaning that there tend to be edges between nodes that are similar in that
regard. The alternative is for a graph or network to be disassortative, meaning that the
edges tend to be found between dissimilar nodes. For a quantitative characteristic, this is
the equivalent of positive autocorrelation between ﬁrst-order or near neighbours in the
graph. Chapter 1 of this book referred to an assortativity index for graphs as might be
applied to the degree of nodes, to characterize the neighbour structure of node degrees.
A similar index could be produced for other properties of interest. As a simple exam-
ple, Figure 5.6 shows two colourings of a graph with 10 nodes and 16 edges. In the
assortative version, there are seven black-to-black edges and seven light-to-light; in the
disassortative version, there are 11 of the 16 edges that join black-to-light, both far from
the approximately 50:50 ratio that might be expected. Clearly, this is the same approach
as the join-count statistics familiar to most ecologists (see Dale & Fortin 2014, Section
6.1). As with many spatial statistics and related measures, while a global statistic can

summarize the assortativity of the whole graph, a local statistic can also be calculated
for regions of the graph, in case there is heterogeneity across the graph. An alterna-
tive is to focus on individual nodes and their immediate neighbourhood to determine
exceptional nodes in the overall network structure (see Piraveenan et al. 2008, 2012).
5.2.8
The Smallest of Clusters: Clustering Coefﬁcient
The term “clustering coefﬁcient” can be a bit confusing, because it may sound like
a measure of the proportion of nodes in a network that are members of well-deﬁned
clusters. In fact, as introduced in Chapter 1 (and see Glossary), it is the proportion of
completed edge triangles: given edges A ─B and A ─C, the frequency with which
B ─C is also an edge . . . This property is sometimes referred to as “triadic closure”: a
question of whether a triad of nodes has edges on two sides of the triangle, “open,” or all
three sides, “closed” (Newman 2010, Section 8.6). It is, however, clearly related to the
concept of clusters, as well as to the overall consistency of the relationship portrayed by
the graph and the “local” concentration of edges, depending on the overall ratio of edges
to nodes or of actual edges to potential positions for edges to occur (“connectance”). The
clustering coefﬁcient is a useful measure to characterize and compare various kinds of
graph-theoretical structure; for example, Fuller et al. (2008) studied the spatial struc-
ture of a tropical dry forest and found that this measure indicated non-random species
associations for one size class of trees (stem diameter 30–35 cm).
5.3
Transitivity and Reciprocity
As for balance, transitivity is a characteristic related to the imprecise concept of the
consistency of the relationships among nodes depicted in a graph. For transitivity, the
.006

All cycles even:

“My friends’ enemies are my enemies; my friends’ friends are my friends.”
focus is on directed graphs, initially without signs, where the edge from node A to
node B signiﬁes an asymmetric relationship. In ecological applications, the relationship
of “A outcompetes B” can be used as a working example, which will appear again in
Chapter 6, although transitivity is relevant to a number of less obvious relationships,
too. A relationship like inter-speciﬁc competitive success is transitive whenever edges
A →B and B →C guarantee A →C. To evaluate the overall transitivity of a graph’s
structure, determine the frequency of transitive triangles in the graph, compared with
the frequency of intransitive triangles which have the equivalent of A →B, B →C, and
then C →A.
For some digraphs, depending on the application (and competitive outcome is not
one), it is possible to have both A →B and B →A. Think of social interactions:
if A likes B, it may or may not be the case that B also likes A (see Figure 5.2a and
5.2c). Where mutual positive outcomes are possible, reciprocity is a measure of how
frequently the relationship is bidirectional.
5.4
Balance
The concept of balance for signed graphs, whether directed or undirected, comes orig-
inally from studies of human sociology or social psychology (Harary 1953; Cartwright
& Harary 1956). In those terms, the basic questions are related to the consistency of
the relationships among interpersonal relationships: Are my friends’ friends also my
friends? Are my enemies’ friends my enemies? Are my enemies’ enemies therefore
my friends (Figure 5.7)? In graph-theoretic terms, for undirected signed graphs, the
.006
15:26:21

5.4 Balance
123
question for triplets of nodes is whether there are an odd or an even number of pairwise
negative relationships; none or two create a balanced pattern. For more than three nodes,
balance is achieved if all edges are positive, or when the nodes can be partitioned into
clusters (two or more) with only positive edges within clusters and only negative edges
between them. Usually, the pattern of associations is not so clear-cut, and the interest of
the researcher is in a measure of the graph’s balance. A cycle is said to be positive when
it has an even number of negative edges, and a graph is fully in balance if all its cycles
are positive. Otherwise, a general measure of balance for a signed graph is the propor-
tion of all cycles that are positive, having an even number of negative edges (Harary
1959). A graph that is balanced can be divided into two clusters of nodes with only
positive edges within clusters and negative edges between them (Harary 1953; Davis
1967). Other potential measures of balance are the number or proportion of edges that
must (a) be removed or (b) have their sign changed in order to achieve perfect balance
(see Wasserman & Faust 1994).
For ecologists, the important question about the networks we study is not just whether
the graph as determined is balanced, but whether there are social, ecological or evo-
lutionary forces that will cause the network to become more balanced through time,
whether balance is evaluated at the local level of triads or motifs or at the global
network-wide level. The answer seems to be often “yes”; Ilany et al. (2013), for example,
provide a good illustration of the tendency to greater balance in the social organization
of wild rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) populations. More generally, very large human
social networks tend to be extremely well balanced, in part because the distributions of
the edge signs are highly skewed to more positive than negative, and because negative
edges cluster at a small number of nodes, rather than being broadly distributed (Fac-
chetti et al. 2011). These nodes are “unpopular individuals” which tend not to have a
large effect on the whole network broadly considered. With further studies of ecological
associations, it will be interesting to see how commonly this kind of structural feature
appears in non-human networks.
Integrative Example: Mixed Forest
As an example that integrates some of the concepts already discussed, consider the
graph theory-based study of the phytosociological structure of a mixed forest in south-
ern Ontario, Canada. The sampling was carried out using three sizes of cylindrical sam-
ple volumes, one for each of three forest layers (tree canopy, shrub and ground) of
different sizes appropriate to the plants in the layer. This design enabled the production
of a digraph with directed edges, both positive and negative, within layers and between
layers from upper to lower (Dale 1977a).
Various graph-theoretical properties were investigated to evaluate the hypothesis that
the community consists of a group of species that co-occur by ecological coincidence,
together with a group of “hangers-on” with presence determined by the positive inﬂu-
ence of species in the ﬁrst group (Goodall 1966). The ﬁrst group of nodes should have
high out-degree, high positive in-degree and large reachable sets, with few negative
edges and much reciprocity within the set. (The reachable set of node u is all the nodes,
.006
15:26:21

124
5 Species Associations, Communities and Graphs of Social Structure
v, for which there is a path from u to v; in a digraph, the strong form of reachability
requires that the directions of the edges in that path are consistent in leading from u to
v.) The second group of nodes should have low out-degrees, more negative edges within
the group and small reachable sets. The whole digraph should consist of a single cluster,
with small diameter and no cut-points.
The results included some unexpected details, such as a certain polarity in the tree
layer with the two oak species forming a small subgroup of their own, and the large
negative in-degree of sugar maple in the shrub and ground layer, because it is extremely
common. In this example, sugar maple seedlings and sapling were so prevalent that
positive associations could not be detected by the sample size available; whereas, for
very rare species, only positive associations could be found to be signiﬁcant. The basic
graph theory properties, however, were consistent with the structure described. One
detail that was expected was a signiﬁcant tendency to disassociative node degrees,
whether using positive or negative edges, and in- or out-degrees (the “adjacent sums”
test; Dale 1977a). As determined by the goodness of ﬁt and variance/mean tests, the
out-degrees’ distribution was not signiﬁcantly different from random expectation, but
the in-degrees were, both overall and for the three layers considered separately. Despite
the unexpected details, the plants of all layers form a single natural grouping of small
diameter (3 for all reachable nodes) but with differences among species as predicted for
the Goodall hypothesis.
The details of the example aside, the most important point is the following:
r Only with graph theory can this hypothesis be expressed in a testable form and only
with graph theory can it be tested!
The second lesson from this example is that (obviously) the edges found for a graph
depend not only on the biology and ecological circumstances (think of “forbidden”
edges in mutualisms), but also on the practicalities and mathematics of the sampling
design and the analysis it supports. For very common species, only their negative asso-
ciations can be detected without very large sample sizes; and for very rare species, only
positive associations are likely to be found to be signiﬁcant.
5.5
Change
Sometimes, or perhaps only rarely, our studies of social networks allow us to evalu-
ate or even to predict change. Change may be the result of conditions external to the
network itself, for example in response to gradual continuous temporal (or even spa-
tial) differences in environmental conditions or in response to sudden changes, perhaps
experimentally applied, as when moisture or fertilizer is added. Equally important are
questions about how a network may change when a node is removed or a new node is
introduced. In those circumstances, it will be useful to determine which characteristics
change and how “far” in the network the changes are felt.
The second kind of change through time that can be observed in social networks are
changes that result from the interactions within the network itself. For example, social

networks with unbalanced subgraphs may tend to change through time to resolve that
tension or instability within the structure, and thus the local elements that contribute to
balance and imbalance (triads or motifs) are important as the basis on which to predict
changes to the network (Ilany et al. 2013). Here, the structure of the graph is affected by
the dynamics within in, just as the dynamics within any network graph is determined or
strongly inﬂuence by its structure. The complex and reciprocal relationship between the
structure and dynamics of network graphs will be discussed at greater length in Chapter
11 of this book.
One of the examples of “social” networks already mentioned is the concept of the
“phytosociological structure” of a plant community, that being the network of positive
and negative associations between the plant species as determined from their positive or
negative tendency to be found in each other’s spatial neighbourhoods. Those neighbour-
hoods may be tricky to deﬁne, particularly in dealing with vegetation in which the plants
exhibit a broad range of sizes, either height or volume (biomass). In some vegetation,
especially forests, it is possible to consider the asymmetric association of smaller plants
with different tree species in the canopy (cf. Dale 1977b), whether the plants in the lower
layer are bryophytes, grasses, forbs or the seedlings of the trees themselves. Where they
are tree or shrub species growing beneath the canopy, an obvious suggestion is that
these will replace the canopy species above them at that location when the canopy tree
dies. If there is a tendency for plants of tree species A to be found under canopy trees of
species B, the replacement of A by B can be predicted (Figure 5.8). There are similarities
between this approach and other examples of species replacement in plant ecology, for
example, the pairwise mutual invasion rates by tillers of four grasses (Lolium perenne,
Festuca arundinaceae, Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) under different grazing regimes
(Silvertown & Wilson 2000); tiller invasion rates allow predictions of species replace-
ment. This is also directly comparable to Horn’s Markov models of succession which

include probabilities of stand type replacement (Horn 1975). This concept has been
revived in the interaction network context, as replacement networks that predict change
based on the dynamics of the system based on data more localized than stand-level, and
using individual species (Alcántara et al. 2015).
With different motivation, Fuller et al. (2008) also looked at the relative locations of
understory trees with canopy trees, but in a tropical dry forest and to evaluate how well
network analysis could detect spatial patterns of association. For each of 106 species,
they identiﬁed each large tree (diameter at least 40 cm) and created a link from it to
any species with trees with crown overlap of 50 percent or greater (Figure 5.9). They
examined the inﬂuence of sub-canopy tree size (seven stem diameter classes) on that
association, based on the network characteristics of node degree distribution, character-
istic path length and clustering coefﬁcient. Assessing the results using randomized data,
they found no signiﬁcant departures in the degree distributions, three of seven diame-
ters were apparently signiﬁcant for path length, and only one of seven for the clustering
coefﬁcient. The path lengths were shorter for the three signiﬁcant size classes, despite
an overall increase when all seven were combined, showing less mixing of species as
neighbours than in the randomized versions. What is not clear from their analysis is
what predictions can be made from the understanding thus generated, although they
conclude by recommending the network approach to other researchers.
5.6
Key Nodes; Key Edges
In any graph of social structure, an obvious place to begin identifying those nodes that
play important roles in the structure is with those that have an inﬂuence on a large

number of nodes, as indicated by the node degree. That’s a place to start, but there
are a number of caveats. In a situation where the relationship being studied may be
asymmetric but the portrayal is symmetric or ambiguous, it will not be known whether
a high degree is the result of being an inﬂuence on many or of being inﬂuenced by many
(it could be both . . . ). In a digraph, the answer may be to look ﬁrst to nodes that have
high out-degrees, and high out-degrees whether positive or negative, although the edge
directions may not always be fully reliable indicators of the true directions of effects,
depending on how they are derived.
Another important way in which a node may be singled out as important to the overall
structure or function can be measured by local assortativity, that is, the node may be a
hot spot (or cold spot) of positive autocorrelation (or negative autocorrelation) of qual-
itative or quantitative characteristics of nodes, especially of interest when the charac-
teristic is the node degree, which again can be divided for many biological applications
into in-degrees and out-degrees in a directed graph (Piraveenan et al. 2012).
5.7
Concluding Comments
The “social structure” of ecological systems and the methods of analysis to be applied
to them clearly have much in common with studies of other societies, whether human,
animal or electronic. The “to do” list for these ecological applications are therefore also
similar, and suggestions of what should be included are given earlier in the chapter:
identify clusters and key nodes; measure reciprocity, triad completion, transitivity and
balance; determine the effects of the environment on social structure and the causes
and impacts of change. That all sounds easy, but as usual, getting the right graph for
the intended purposes can be an imposing difﬁculty, and interpreting the results of the
graph theory analysis can also be challenging. The real challenge for ecologists is to
integrate the elements of social structure and the graphs and graph properties that go
with it into a larger understanding of the structure of ecological interactions and their
dynamics in a changing environment.

Competition: Hierarchies and
Reversals
Introduction
In the preceding chapter, competition was cited as a key interaction contributing to
social structure for almost any organism; in addition, competition between individuals
and between species is one of the strongest and most important interactions for both
the ecological function of natural systems and the evolution of organisms (Chave 2009).
Graphs in several formats can be helpful in studies of competition, depending on the
system and the data. For example, in a graph of plant community social structure as
described in Chapter 5, a negative directed edge from species A to species B may result
from competitive exclusion or suppression of B by A, whether through interference
caused by allelopathic chemicals or through light preemption by overgrowth. In this
case, the edges detected in a social structure graph can be combined with graph theory
to help develop and evaluate ecological hypotheses (see Dale 1977a).
Graphs can also be used to summarize and to analyze the encounters of competitors,
whether only in time, as with records of periods of close proximity allowing opportuni-
ties for competitive interaction between animals; only in space, such as the regions of
contact between the margins of colonies of crustose lichens; or in space and time, such
as data from GPS collars on mobile animals.
A third application of graphs in competition studies is the depiction of hierarchies of
competitive success. In animal behaviour, this is often considered as a dominance rela-
tionship, individual A dominates individual B, and B dominates C, producing a hierar-
chy or “pecking order” (see Schjelderup-Ebbe 1975). This kind of hierarchy can be a
complete ordering with a clear dominance relationship between any pair, or there can be
ties or ambiguities between some pairs with others well deﬁned, thus giving a “partial
order” (Brüggemann & Carlsen 2006). Hierarchies can also be found among species,
for example among plants where competitive success can be correlated with growth
rates and leaf area (see Grime 1979),producing a partial order of competitors; but also
among boreal ants (Savolainen & Vepsäläinen 1988) and frugivorous birds in tropical
forests (Thornton et al. 2015), where the ordering is complete. It is this third application
that will be the focus of this chapter, describing these hierarchies and exceptions within
them. For ecologists, graph theory can help in generating explicit hypotheses about the
structural characteristics of ecological systems, often using hierarchical series for sets
of similar relationships among individuals or among classes of organisms. This chapter
focusses on applying graph theory to the quantiﬁable outcome of competition among

several competitors and its translation into hierarchies of competitive success, whether
among ecotypes, genotypes, species or genera. As a general term, competition among
several taxa (“competitors”) can be referred to as “multi-species” competition and here
are a few concepts and assumptions to be considered:
r Competition is an interaction between organisms with the potential to share resources;
for each individual, it leads to a reduction in resources captured, growth, reproduc-
tive output, overall ﬁtness and so on. It is often measured by the reduction in output
attributable to the interaction; for example, plants producing fewer seeds when in
competition compared to having no competitors at all or competitors only of its own
species (Figure 6.1). This can apply to individuals or to species.
r Competition is usually asymmetrical; the effects of the interaction are greater, or pro-
portionally greater, for one of the competitors, even in a simple pairwise situation.
Again, this is true whether it is individuals or species competing.
r Competition occurs between individuals of the same species (i.e. “intra-speciﬁc”),
as well as between individuals from different taxa of whatever level of classiﬁcation
(“inter-speciﬁc”). The effects of intra-speciﬁc competition can be evaluated by com-
parison with performance in the absence of competition; the effects of inter-speciﬁc
competition are usually evaluated by comparison with intra-speciﬁc performance.
r Plant competition studies are often based on trials of pairs of competitors and extrap-
olation to larger sets may be difﬁcult, even from two at a time to three at a time.
For three competitors, it is conceivable that the combined competition of competitor
A and competitor C on competitor B may be stronger than the simple addition of
their separate effects (“competitive ampliﬁcation”; Weigelt et al. 2007); the stronger
combined effect could drive B to local extinction, where competition from A alone
(suppose that effect is chieﬂy above-ground) and from C alone (suppose that is chieﬂy
below-ground) is less severe and allows coexistence (Figure 6.2, top). On the other
hand, it is also possible that where strong competitive effects from competitor C might

drive B to local extinction, competition from A reduces the effect from C (“compet-
itive release”; Weigelt et al. 2007); allowing B to persist despite competition from
both. This was referred to as “indirect facilitation” in Chapter 4 (Figure 4.16j; see
Figure 6.2, bottom).
Although competition is a key interaction that structures the spatial arrangement of
plants and their mutual dynamics in natural communities, it is difﬁcult to assess in the
multi-species context. As suggested above, a common approach is to break down the
competitive interactions among n competitors into pairwise trials and the challenge is
then to evaluate those results to make sense of the whole multi-species set. Fortunately,
graph theory provides the right “machinery” for approaching and solving this difﬁculty.
An initial step is to abstract the essentials of the study in a graph, with nodes represent-
ing the competitors and their interactions portrayed by edges. The edges will usually
have directions, and signs (+ or –) or quantitative labels. The use of graphs to depict
multi-species competition is especially appropriate when the tests have been pairwise
because the edges are also pairwise.

ble edges need to be included and these will depend on the format of the experimental
results and on criteria for inclusion. One choice is to retain all edges (two per pair,
one in each direction) with a quantitative weight related to competitive performance
for each edge; this is a “weighted complete digraph” (Figure 6.3, top). This produces
many edges, which may be reduced by retaining some and discarding others based on a
threshold value for the weights. An alternative starting point is a digraph with one edge
for every pair of nodes, directed from the better competitor to the less successful, usu-
ally without a weight. This digraph is called a “tournament” for obvious reasons (Figure
6.3, bottom; see Moon 1968). Even starting with the lower connectance (half that of the
complete graph), it may still be useful to reduce the number of edges by retaining only
those that exceed some threshold that distinguishes strong or clear competitive domi-
nance from less convincing outcomes. Whichever the starting point for developing the
digraph of competitive outcomes, one important purpose is to examine the full set of
outcomes for the consistency of competitive performance in a range of combinations or
conditions. Key concepts for that investigation are the “transitivity” of the competitive
relationship and the strictness of the resulting competitive hierarchy.
The concept of transitivity is ﬁrst a qualitative property of the interactions among
three competitors: if A →B and B →C, then A →C, so that the competitive dominance
represented by the arrow is a transitive relationship. The triangle of edges in a transitive
structure is directional overall (for example, A to C); the alternative is a triangle of
edges that give a functional cycle (functionally cyclic), as in A →B, B →C and C →
A (Figure 6.4). The relationship in such a cyclic triangle is not transitive. Transitivity

is the key characteristic of multi-participant competitive structures, such as hierarchies,
because it is the basis for measures and understanding of consistency among competitive
outcomes or the extent of and reasons for departures from that consistency. Given a
transitive triangle of nodes and one-way competitive outcomes, a quantitative version
of transitivity can be investigated: given quantitative assessments of the effects of each
of the competitive interactions on the participants, how well can the value of the third
edge, say A →C, be predicted from the values of A →B and B →C? Determining
an appropriate measure in order to calculate an expected value with the observed is a
complicated issue (Figure 6.4) and will be treated in more detail below.
The concept of a “competitive hierarchy” for a set of competitors is that the outcomes
of competition, even if not perfectly consistent and as represented by the directional
arrows of the edges, form a complete or partial ordering. Even in a partial order that
allows ties, the result is a hierarchical structure from strongest to weakest competitors.
If, on the other hand, the competitive relationship is completely transitive through-
out the entire set of competitor interactions, the results should give a complete and
unambiguous hierarchy in which all the competitors can be assigned a rank from best
(outcompetes all others) to worst (outcompeted by all others). Unambiguous hierarchies
can be the result of experiments even when not every pairing gives a clear winner, as
long as the order based on “wins” and “losses” has no ties (see Roxburgh & Wilson
2000). Such strict hierarchies are likely to be rare, even without an appeal to allow
some apparent inconsistency based on merely probable outcomes or habitat dependence
(see Petraitis 1979). If the competitive relationship is not completely transitive, a simple
measure of how intransitive it is can be constructed from the number of edges which
would have to be reversed to make the structure completely transitive (Petraitis 1979).
This measure can be adapted to deal with other cases, such as where the edges have
weights quantifying relative performance (Petraitis 1979).
In plant ecology, we speak of a “competitive reversal,” referring to a competitive
outcome of a pairwise test that is in contradiction to the overall ranking of a hierarchy

(the sense to be used here) or that is unexpected based on past outcomes under other
growing conditions (not to be the sense here). The competitive structure may not be a
true hierarchy nor a partial ordering, because it contains triangles of edges that are not
transitive (functionally cyclic) or because it includes some sort of structural competitive
reversal. These can be viewed in two ways. First they may be seen as edges that are
somehow wrong and these are the ones to be ﬂipped to revert to a perfect outcome, as
just described. The second interpretation is that these are edges that can tell us much
more about the process of competition and the natures of the competitors because they
produce outcomes at odds with the expected. These reversals encourage us to examine
more closely the pattern and process of competition, and will be discussed further in
reference to a speciﬁc example below.
6.1.1
More on Transitivity in Tournaments
In a full tournament, all pairs of nodes are joined by exactly one edge that goes in one
direction or another, and so for any three labelled nodes and those three edges, there are
23 possible graphs, and thus 23 triplet subgraphs (or sub-tournaments). Of those eight
triangles, six are transitive in which there is one overall winner and one overall loser,
and the in-degrees for the sequence 0, 1, 2, and the out-degrees form the sequence 2,
1, 0. The other two triangle digraphs (n = 3 tournaments) are “functional cycles” or
cyclic, with all out-degrees and all in-degrees being 1 (Figure 6.5). In simple terms,
this means that A outcompetes B, B outcompetes C, but C outcompetes A. This is the
children’s game of “paper-rock-scissors” in which each element in the cycle defeats
one and loses to one (see Maynard-Smith 1982). While the transitive triangles have the
potential to ﬁt in theories of competitive hierarchies, the cyclic triangles are essentially

anti-hierarchical. In most ecological theories, competitive cycles should not exist, based
on the concept of consistent unidirectional competitive superiority. On the other hand,
the long-term outcome of competitive hierarchies should be the exclusion or extinction
of the weakest competitors, and intransitivity can be appealed to as a mechanism for
enhanced coexistence and species richness (Ulrich et al. 2014; Soliveres et al. 2015;
Permogorskiy 2015).
In graph theory, any tournament that is not strictly transitive (all triplets have the tran-
sitivity property), is referred to as “paradoxical”; in fact a tournament is k-paradoxical
if for every subset with k nodes there is a node external to the subset that dominates all
its members (Erdös 1963). The non-transitive triangles are 1-paradoxical because every
node has an “external” node that defeats it.
Of the triplet competition digraphs (the n = 3 tournaments), two are cyclic, six transi-
tive. What happens when a fourth competitor is added? The addition of a fourth labelled
node to a digraph of three labelled nodes creates eight new graphs (or subgraphs of a
larger tournament). There are now six positions for edges, and so 26 = 64 digraphs in
total (see Figure 6.6). If the initial graph is already cyclic, of the eight new graphs, two
have an extra 3-cycle created by the addition of the new node, and four have both an
extra 3-cycle and a 4-cycle created; only two have no new cycles additional to the origi-
nal. If the initial triplet graph is transitive, not cyclic, of the eight new graphs, two have
a 3-cycle created, and two have both a 3-cycle and a 4-cycle created by the additional
node. Starting with a transitive digraph of the three nodes, given random directions of
the new edges, half the resulting digraphs now contain at least one cycle, and there-
fore are not completely transitive. For three nodes, 2 of 8 graphs are cyclic; for four
nodes, it is 36 out of 64, if the edge directions are randomly assigned. With a leap of
logic, rather than analysis, one might guess that, with randomly directed edges, large
single-edge digraphs very probably have some subgraphs that are cyclic not transitive,
representing competitive reversals. This conjecture was proved by Erdös (1963): for any
ﬁxed value of k, large numbers of nodes (something like k22k nodes) almost guarantee
that the tournament is k-paradoxical. This suggests that transitivity is not expected if
the edges are random in a tournament structure; but in an ecological setting, truly inde-
pendent randomness of direction is not expected. It is important, however, to be able
to compare the results with those that are expected from randomness! One might pro-
pose that non-transitive subgraphs will be much more rare in real data than in random
tournaments, because the directions are neither random nor independent. However, this

6.2 Measuring Competitive Outcomes

aspect of potential competitive hierarchies is deﬁnitely worth pursuing, along with the
transitivity of relationships in directional triplets, and the relationship of transitivity to
position in a competitive hierarchy.
This discussion only begins to describe the wide range of possible analytic opportu-
nities there are to enhance our understanding of competitive networks among species,
genotypes or ecotypes using weighted directed graphs that depict the outcomes of pair-
wise competition tests. There is much yet to be discovered!
6.1.2
Quantitative Transitivity
For a complete digraph of competitive structure, because it has all possible directed
edges, qualitative transitivity is everywhere because for any three nodes, the directed
triangle of edges is always present: A →B, B →C and A →C. Only when the out-
come weights are taken into account is there much to learn from or about transitivity:
it must be a quantitative concept and have a quantitative measure. Even in a tourna-
ment structure, there is more to be learned about these interactions from a quantitative
approach than from simple qualitative transitivity.
The qualitative deﬁnition of transitivity is simply that if A →B and B →C, then
A →C (Figure 6.4), without any implications about the strength of the unidirectional
relationship depicted by the arrow. A complete digraph, which has all edges and a weight
on each edge, should allow a test of the transitivity of quantitative competition relation-
ships. For any triplet of competitors, A, B and C, the observed value of some measure
of the competitive effect of C on A, call it the weight w(AC), should be able to be com-
pared with its expected value E(w(AC)), based on w(AB) and w(BC) if the quantitative
relationship of competitive effect is perfectly transitive. This requires the right mea-
sure of competitive effect. Dormann (2006) and Freckleton and Watkinson (2001) have
provided what seems to be an appropriate measure that will allow this quantitative com-
parison. Dormann (2006) explained it this way: if εAB is to represent the competitive
effect of B on A, for example measured by reduced biomass, but somehow expressed in
equivalents of A, then what is needed is a measure properly designed so that if one unit
of competitor A reduces the growth of A by 0.5 g and one unit of competitor B reduces
it by 2 g, εAB = 2/0.5 = 4. Then, given this approach, and with εBC representing the
competitive effect of C on B expressed in equivalents of B, and so on, perfect quantita-
tive transitivity leads to εAC = εAB × ε BC. For this to work with the kind of data most
likely to be available, the suggested measure is wAB = ([A]0 – [A]B) ÷ ([A]0 – [A]A)
where [A]0 is the output of A when grown without competitors; [A]A is the output of
A in competition with A, and [A]B is the same but in competition with B. With transi-
tivity, E(w(AB)) = w(AC) × w(CB), E(w(BA)) = w(BC) × w(CA), and so on, for the
general comparison of observed and expected values.
6.2
Measuring Competitive Outcomes
The “strength” of the inter-speciﬁc competition is often assessed by comparison with
the results of competition within the same type (“intra-speciﬁc”). Because competition
.007
15:26:23

136
6 Competition: Hierarchies and Reversals
is often, or almost always, asymmetric, we tend to speak loosely about one type out-
competing another, at least under the conditions currently tested: “A outcompetes B” or
summarized as “A →B.” The strength of this effect can be quantiﬁed in many ways, but
start with [X]Y, meaning “the output of type X in competition with type Y,” whether the
output is biomass, seed heads or a count of seeds produced. In many cases, the informa-
tion available will be output observations of the form [A]B and [A]A. On that basis, the
inter-speciﬁc to intra-speciﬁc ratios R(A|B) = [A]B / [A]A and R(B|A) = [B]A / [B]B,
can be proposed as measures of inter-speciﬁc competitive success; suppose the values
are 0.9 and 0.7 (see Figure 6.1, top). Even if [B]A > [A]B, one might conclude that
the competition between A and B has a more negative effect on B than on A, based on
the values of R(A|B) and R(B|A). In creating a digraph for the results of a competition
study, edges can be placed between the nodes for A and B in both directions, each with
a weight based on the competitive success index, R(A|B) – 1. For example, the weight
is −0.3 for “A →B” and −0.1 for “B →A” in Figure 6.1 (middle). An alternative is to
use a threshold to eliminate some edges, allowing only the “stronger” results as edges
(Figure 6.1, bottom). For example, inclusion could be determined by the ratio of the
weights:
[A]B/[A]A ÷ [B]A/[B]B = R (A|B) ÷ R (B|A) = 1.29 (vs 0.7 ÷ 0.9 = 0.78).
(6.1)
The difference between these weights can also be considered as a reasonable measure
for determining edge inclusion:
[A]B/[A]A −[B]A/[B]B; 0.9 −0.7 = 0.2.
(6.2)
In cases where the output values for the “no competitor” situation are available, the
index already introduced is a good choice:
wAB = ([A]0 −[A]B) ÷ ([A]0 −[A]A).
(6.3)
Consider the directed pair transitivity measure, TAB = wAB ÷ [wAC × wCB]. For any
triplet of nodes with all six directed edges, there are six measures of transitivity (see
Figure 6.5, top two rows). Another complication is the fact that for n competitors, any
one of the n(n −1) directional edges of a complete weighted digraph is one side of
(n −2) triangles, and therefore has the same number of possible evaluations of its
contribution to the overall transitivity of the whole structure. For example, in Figure
6.7, n is 5; node triplet ABC has the six measures of transitivity illustrated at the top
of Figure 6.5, but the directed edge A →B itself has three measures of transitivity, one
for each triangle created by nodes C, D or E. It may be easier to aggregate the results
for each edge rather than for each triplet. One appealing way of using these edges is
to designate some as “hot,” for large values of TAC, and others as “cold,” for small
values; these could be colour coded for clarity in the competitive outcomes graph (not
illustrated, but worth trying).
The discussion of which measures have the best and most preferred properties may
suggest that the measures should be the focus; but, in fact, the focus should be how the
results are used. The outcome of pairwise competition changes with growing conditions,

such as high versus low nutrient or high versus low light. Therefore all discussions about
outcomes are in the context of those particular conditions.
6.3
Choosing Edges and Finding Hierarchies
Given a set of nodes that represent the competitors, whether they are species, genotypes
or ecotypes, there are many ways of determining the pairs to be joined by edges to create
a graph of the competitive outcomes. The number and density of edges is maximal
at two edges per pair of nodes, giving n(n −1) edges, which is useful only if they
have weights (as in Figure 6.3, top). Low connectance, such as a spanning tree, may be
too sparse to be useful. Intermediate connectance may work best, say 2 or 3 edges per
node. If priority is given to the edges with the largest weights, this may create a graph
that is not fully connected, but the number of edges could be adjusted to ensure full
connectivity. Two approaches worth discussing are the use of threshold values applied
to all possible edges and the identiﬁcation of the stronger competitor of each pair in the
tournament.
6.3.1
All Edges with Weights and Asymmetry Thresholds
Assuming there is a measure of competitive success for both A →B and B →A, there
are n(n −1) positions for possible edges. Any reasonable single threshold value for
that index can be chosen, say 0.8 indicating that all edges show combinations where the
target competitor was able to achieve 80 percent of its intra-typic output. Any threshold
produces a digraph, but some pairs of nodes may have edges in both directions and some
pairs may have no edges between them; in fact, some nodes may have no edges. Rather
than choosing a single threshold value, edges can be added one at a time, starting with
the largest weights, and decreasing the threshold value until a desired density of edges,

the number of edges that are included.
or a desired level of connectedness, is achieved. For example, using the edge density
of the Gabriel graph as a somewhat arbitrary comparator but intermediate in the range
of connectance, the threshold could be adjusted to give 2n edges. The sliding threshold
provides the opportunity to monitor the “evolution” of the graph: how its characteristics
(such as number of connected components, number of singletons, average non-zero
degrees, etc.) change with the density of edges.
6.3.2
Tournament Edge Selection by Dominance
The second general approach begins with a tournament, a digraph that designates a
“winner” of competition from each pair of competitors, which can to enhance our under-
standing of competitive hierarchies. This is a complete simple digraph, in which every
node has (n −1) edges, one to or from each other node, representing the asymmetric
competitive relationship. In the vocabulary of tournament graph theory, if A →B, A
“dominates” B, which is similar to the ecological description of the relationship between
A and B. With an index of competitive success for each directional pair, A →B and
B →A, a variation is to include only the edge of any pair that has the larger competitive
index and exceeds the lesser weight by some “reasonable” difference (e.g. 20 percent)
or ratio (see Figure 6.8). Again, the difference or ratio could be adjusted to produce a
chosen density of edges (e.g. 2 per node), or a sliding cut-off could be used in order to
follow the evolution of the digraph and its characteristics.
In summary, four choices available for digraphs of competitive structures are as fol-
lows:
r Full complete graph: Edges for all n(n −1) directional relationships, each edge
weighted by quantitative outcome(s), for which there are several choices.
.007
15:26:23

6.3 Choosing Edges and Finding Hierarchies
139
1 Ratio of ﬁnal outputs: RAB = R(A|B) = [A]B ÷ [A]A = (e.g. biomass of A at three
weeks when grown in competition with B)/(biomass of A at three weeks when
grown in competition with itself).
2 Ratio of output reductions: wAB = ([A]0 – [A]B) ÷ ([A]0 – [A]A) where [A]0 is the
output of competitor A when grown without any competition; subscripts A and B
representing intra-typic and inter-typic competition.
The complete digraph preserves almost all the information, or can, but it may be insuf-
ﬁciently abstracted to be very useful.
r Reduced complete graph with inclusion based on weights: Select relationships
depending on the largest outcome weights using a threshold value; for example,
include all edges A →B for which A|B > 0.8. Obviously, the choice of threshold
value is going to have a big effect on the graph produced from a given data set.
r Full tournament (“Dominance”): One directional relationship per pair, being the one
with the larger weight, that is A →B if A|B > B|A or B →A if A|B < B|A, giving
n(n −1)/2 directional edges. This approach captures the notion of “winner” versus
“loser” in competition, and may omit weight values by using only the sign of the
difference.
r Reduced tournament (“Greatest Dominance”): At most one directional relationship
per pair, being the one with the larger weight, and
1 (“Value Limit”) only if that weight exceeds a certain threshold OR,
2 (“Difference limit”) only if the difference or ratio between higher and lower index
exceeds a certain threshold.
Obviously there are other choices possible, but these four provide a good range of pos-
sibilities, especially with the ﬂexibility afforded by adjusting the threshold value used
to select or remove edges. This description of methodological choices is more detailed
than in some other discussions, but this is an area that has been well worked out with
speciﬁc examples as illustration.
6.3.3
Creating a Competitive Hierarchy from the Results
Including only selected edges to study the structure of competitive relationships enables
the creation of a partially ordered set to approximate a competitive hierarchy through
ranking competitors by the out-degrees and in-degrees of their nodes in the digraph
based on the measure of the asymmetry of the outcome of pairwise competition inter-
action. The simplest approach is to assign each node a score corresponding to its level
in the hierarchy calculated as the out-degree minus the in-degree (Figure 6.9). This
approach allows taking a digraph of the outcomes (Figure 6.10), and converting it to a
hierarchical structure (Figure 6.11), although more than one node can occur in a particu-
lar level, because of potential ties (nodes A, E and K all have a score of +1). Those with
high out-degrees and low in-degrees will tend to be at the top of the competitive hierar-
chy, even if it is not perfectly ordered; those with low out-degrees and high in-degrees
will be near the bottom. Of course, the literature shows that competitive reversals do

occur, in which a competitor with low out-degree may nevertheless “out-compete” one
with high out-degree in a pairwise test. What is potentially of interest is to colour the
edges here by the “hot” versus “cold” scheme described above to determine whether the
observed/expected ratios tend to be surprisingly large or surprisingly small higher or
lower in the hierarchy or evenly mixed throughout.
6.4
Example: Arabidopsis thaliana Ecotypes
An example is always helpful in explaining concepts and principles, and this one exam-
ines competition among ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana, a small winter annual known
as Rock Cress that is famous as the subject of genetic studies. The same concepts and
principles, here within a species, apply equally to competition among less closely related
plants (such as the many species in a natural plant community) as well as to relation-
ships other than plant competition which may be conceptually less straightforward. The
experiment started with 13 ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana and an out-group for com-
parison, which was left out of this analysis, grown in both high and low nutrient con-
ditions. The data for the ecotype called 7 are incomplete, and so it also was omitted,
leaving 12 ecotypes for analysis. We looked at both the “value limit” and the “differ-
ence limit” rules for creating edges among the 12 nodes representing the ecotypes. For
both rules, we adjusted a threshold value to produce about 2n = 24 edges, which is a
moderate level of connectance (comparable to the Gabriel graph, which is intermediate
in the well-known hierarchy of “topological” rules for neighbour networks; see Dale &
Fortin 2014, Section 3.1.1). For the “value limit” rule, the low nutrient data gave 24
edges with a threshold of 0.68 (Figure 6.12) and the high nutrient data gave 28 edges

nutrient with a threshold of 0.3, and 30 edges for high nutrient with a threshold of 0.2
(not shown). For each of the four digraphs, a partial hierarchy was derived based on the
difference between the nodes’ out- and in-degrees. Larger out-degree and smaller in-
degree place the node further up in the hierarchy. Nodes that are tied for the difference
between out-degree and in-degree are at the same level in the hierarchy. A “reversal” is
counted whenever there is a dominance edge from a node lower in the hierarchy to one
that is higher. The positions of the reversals in the hierarchies were tabulated, to deter-
mine whether they were highly localized among the weakest competitors, or among
the strongest, or whether they appeared throughout the hierarchy. This also allowed an
examination of whether the reversals tended to be short, between closely ranked com-
petitors, or long, between more distant ranks.

competition digraphs. The very weakest competitor was never in a reversal, but in three
of the four examples, the best competitor in the hierarchy was outcompeted by one other
less successful ecotype.
Different measures and different thresholds or rules for edge inclusion will give hier-
archy graphs that differ in their details, but given the overall characteristics of the inter-
action among the competitors, the general features of the hierarchies and reversals are
expected to be similar but not the same.
The (Smart) Things to Do
For the results of a complete tournament of pairwise competition tests:
1 Create a digraph of the outcomes with an intermediate edge density (e.g. 2n
edges).
2 Determine a partial order of the competitors based on the nodes’ in-degrees and
out-degrees.
3 Measure the overall degree of transitivity in this structure and determine local hot-
or cold spots of high or low transitivity.

4 Find any edges of competitive reversal and characterize their positions in the
digraph:
a Are they random in placement or are they throughout the hierarchy?
b Are they concentrated near the top of the hierarchy indicating that the better
competitors are less predictable?
c Are they concentrated near the bottom of the hierarchy, indicating that the
weaker competitors are less predictable?
d Are the reversal edges comparatively short or tall, indicating competitors of
similar overall ability or ones that differ greatly?

Experiments with Phytometers
The reversals and other complexities revealed by the tournament approach to evalu-
ating competition highlight some of the difﬁculties inherent in other approaches. The
phytometer method for evaluating comparative competitive ability among a group of
several plants uses performance with a single reference competitor to evaluate the suc-
cess of many without the large number of pairwise tests. Usually only one competitor,
the phytometer, is chosen and all other competitors are tested against it to assess relative
competitive abilities. Suppose that by some unlucky chance, ecotype 5 in the Arabidop-
sis trials had been chosen as the phytometer. Based on the hierarchy graph of Figure
6.12, one might conclude that 10 was the strongest competitor with 4, 9 (the weakest
in our hierarchy), 11 (the strongest), and 12 being similar in competitive ability, and all
inferior to 5.
This approach also leads to more questions, such as:
Do the competitive reversals enhance coexistence in the absence of spatial effects?
How does spatial structure alter the effects of competitive reversals on coexistence?
Many questions such as these have been investigated using a variety of modelling
approaches (e.g. Laird & Schamp 2006, 2008), and spatial heterogeneity clearly plays a
role in allowing or promoting coexistence (Schreiber & Killingback 2013), as do inter-
actions with organisms such as the soil biota (Lankau et al. 2010).
6.5.2
Animals and Competitive Hierarchies
The same basic structure of competitive hierarchy or competitive ranking, as described
in detail for plants and in the Arabidopsis example, is commonly observed in animals,
too, usually at the level of inter-individual interactions in a “social” context, often easily
observed based on behaviour and often described in terms of “dominance” relation-
ships. The familiar term “pecking order,” was originally used to describe a behavioural
dominance ranking in domestic fowl (Schjelderup-Ebbe 1975). In many animals, the

dominance hierarchies are based on and reinforced by a broad range of behaviours,
including pecking (among birds), mock or real ﬁghts, physical displays of aggression,
dominant versus submissive postures and so on. There are cases of animal communities
being structured by competition resulting in hierarchies, with good examples among ant
communities, for instance (Savolainen & Vepsäläinen 1988), and possibly other social
insects. There is a large body of literature on dominance hierarchies, how to measure
them, and their effects on social structure and evolution (Landau 1951; de Vries et al.
2006; Vehrencamp 1983). It is not clear whether these hierarchies often allow the sorts
of reversals that seem to be prevalent in the plant competition examples, but there are
similar inconsistencies in competition among corals (Buss & Jackson 1979), and there is
a well-documented example of a reversal among boreal ants, with a submissive species
excluding a dominant (Vepsäläinen & Czechowski 2014).
6.5.3
Network Context
Competition is not the only interaction for which transitivity is an interesting and poten-
tially highly important property. For example, the transitivity of “trust” in social net-
works can have both social and economic implications (see Richters & Peixoto 2011).
Transitivity, as well as triad closure, turns out to be an important property of protein-
protein interaction (PPI) networks, whether the network edges have weights (e.g. afﬁni-
ties; Yugandhar & Gromiha 2016), signs (e.g. activated or repressed; Vinayagam et al.
2014), or implicit directions (e.g. preference relations or signal ﬂow; Liu et al. 2009).
There are many interesting parallels between ecological interaction networks and those
at the cellular and molecular level as exempliﬁed by these protein-protein interaction
networks (Ding et al. 2006; Itzhaki et al. 2010; Peterson et al 2012; see also the reviews
by Pržulj 2010 and Raman 2010). For example, one motivation is the belief that by
combining knowledge of the shape of an individual protein with knowledge its posi-
tion in the interaction network and the topology of that network itself, will allow good
predictions of the protein’s function and its role in the network (see Pržulj et al. 2004;
Borgwardt et al. 2005; Pržulj 2010; Winterbach et al. 2013; Peterson et al. 2012). This
motivation is similar to the search in ecological studies to understand the relationship
between the pair of concepts variously labelled as form and function, structure and
dynamics or pattern and process, as will be pursued in Chapter 11.
Competition in natural communities is very different from the relatively clear results
of pairwise competition tournaments. Not only will there be the complicating effects of
multi-species competition from individuals with a range of physical sizes and at a range
of physical distances from the focal plant, there is also a range of possible mechanisms
of competition (Weigelt et al. 2007). There are also indirect effects such as apparent
competition (see Figure 4.16d) or apparent facilitation (Figure 6.2, bottom) that come
into play where the interactions with herbivores, pathogens and mutualists have their
own impact on what is observed (or not!) (see Clay 1990). In addition, it is well known
that the outcome of competition depends upon environmental conditions in a very sen-
sitive way (e.g. Lankau et al. 2010) and natural environments tend to be heterogeneous

both spatially and temporally, all contributing to the natural disorderliness of plant com-
munities (see Fowler 1990). Just determining the basic graph of competitive outcomes
in a natural community is an enormous challenge. Even if the discussion of hierarchies
and reversals in pairwise competition trials seems removed from what happens in multi-
species communities and multi-level ecosystems, the results and understanding derived
from them have important implications, both for ecological theory and for practical
application. The contribution of intransitivity in competition to species coexistence is a
critical component for community ecology, despite the multiplicity of underlying causes
and any lack of clarity of under what circumstances it most strongly applies. Graph the-
ory and its application to these ecological systems are essential for understanding how
competition in these systems really works.

Mutualism, Parasitism and Bipartite
Graphs
Introduction
In some kinds of inter-speciﬁc interactions, the interacting species belong to two distinct
functional classes; for example, in mutualisms these classes may be ﬂowering plants and
their pollinators, plants and mycorrhizal fungi, etc. and in antagonistic interactions these
classes may be mammals and their ectoparasites, insects and endo-parasites, etc. Such
two-class inter-speciﬁc interactions can be positive, negative or neutral, and they are
key factors in the functioning of communities and ecosystems, as well as strong driv-
ing forces, through the coevolution of the interacting species, in evolutionary change,
speciation and community diversity.
Studies of these interactions are portrayed by bipartite graphs, which have two sub-
sets of nodes representing the species in the two functional classes, and edges that run
between nodes in different subsets but not within subsets. Although there are interac-
tions between species within a subset, especially direct or indirect competition, they
are not usually included in this interaction graph, because the focus of analysis is the
interaction between the two functional classes.
The basic structure of the bipartite graph means that some of the measures used
to characterize other types of graphs (e.g. average path length or node centrality) are
less appropriate for the purpose, while other characteristics (e.g. modularity [compart-
ments], nestedness and symmetry vs asymmetry) are more informative. A third set of
characteristics, such as the distribution of the nodes’ degrees and the distribution of
neighbouring node degrees, are of special importance here.
This chapter describes how mutualistic interactions between plants and animals,
including pollination, seed dispersal, and herbivory, and antagonistic interactions, in the
various forms of parasitism, can be studied using bipartite and other kinds of graphs,
and how graph-theoretical characteristics provide insights into these ecological systems.

compartments. For plants and pollinators, nestedness means that highly specialized pol-
linators are associated only with plants that have many pollinators and that plants with
very few pollinators are served by generalists (Figure 7.1). This structure increases neg-
ative autocorrelation among the degrees of adjacent nodes. A modular bipartite rela-
tionship has subsets of the plants that are pollinated by well-deﬁned subsets of the pol-
linators, with reciprocal specialization for both classes (giving small subsets) as well
as reciprocal generalists in both parts of the graph (Figure 7.2). This produces strong
positive autocorrelation of the degrees of nodes linked by interaction edges (low with
low for specialists and high with high for generalists); or fairly uniform subsets of both
partners forming modules, which need not be fully isolated from each other. The same
data, in the form of a plant × pollinator combination table, can be arranged to empha-
size its nestedness or re-arranged to emphasize compartments, and while neither will be
a perfect ﬁt, one will be better than the other (for an example, see Bascompte & Jordano
2014, Figure 3.6). Fortunately, these possibilities can be evaluated easily by comparison
with null models (see Dormann et al. 2009; Dorman 2011) or by means of restricted
randomizations. (The R package “bipartite” does the former.) Most of the general
principles for network evaluation apply to distributions generated for null hypotheses

in bipartite graphs, with the obvious limitations on the possible positions for edges, of
which there are only n1 × n2.
While most of the properties of interest in these graphs are accessible when the data
are in the “binary” form (interaction: yes or no), some studies have or require quanti-
tative data on the strength or intensity of the interaction. For example, researchers may
want to assess how important a particular interaction is to each of the partners, because
that may be quite asymmetric: critical to one and negligible to the other. Importance
may be harder to measure, but frequencies of interactions may be good indicators to be
used as weights in these interaction networks (Thompson 2006).
For host-parasite systems, nestedness may take the form of ﬁnding only very spe-
cialized parasites on hosts of high parasite richness, and only generalist parasites on
hosts with low parasite richness (Vázquez et al. 2005b). A parallel ﬁnding, based on
host abundance rather than on parasite richness, is that the more abundant host species
tend to have richer parasite fauna and to have a higher representation of rare specialist
parasites (Vázquez et al. 2005b). The same kind of structuring with a mismatch of gen-
eralists versus specialists is found in plant-pollinator systems and other similar species
interactions (Dormann et al. 2009).
In both mutualistic networks and antagonistic networks reciprocal specialization
involving single species or small groups of species is unexpectedly rare (Joppa et al.
2009). Bascompte and Jordano (2014) make the point that the observed infrequency of
specialist-specialist interactions in pollination networks is both unexpected from ran-
domness alone and contrary to earlier assumptions about the prevalence of specialist-
specialist mutualisms based on natural history observations without statistical conﬁr-
mation. It is not clear what mechanisms give rise to the commonly observed nested-
ness in mutualistic networks, but it may be related to selection pressures that tend to
increase species abundances with which nestedness in the interaction matrix is corre-
lated (Suweis et al. 2013). Using spectral graph theory (Chung 1997), it can be shown
that highly nested graphs are those with the largest dominant eigenvalues, for both
binary interaction graphs (just 1s and 0s) and for graphs with quantitative measures
of interaction strength for each edge (Staniczenko et al. 2012). Those researchers found
that while most binary mutualism graphs were signiﬁcantly nested, the quantitative ver-
sions were not, suggesting reduced consumer overlap that would reduce competition
(Staniczenko et al. 2012). Medan et al. (2007) showed a close relationship between nest-
edness and the truncated power law for node degree distributions, and that nestedness
arises spontaneously in a self-organizing network model with the equivalent of prefer-
ential attachment. It is not clear, however, how well these factors apply in the relatively
small sizes of the mutualistic networks observed in nature. Relative species abundance
seems to be an important factor, based on studies of neutral mutualist communities
which develop neither random nor compartmentalized structures (Krishna et al. 2008).
The presence of forbidden or impossible linkages, as described in 7.1.4, can also be an
important factor in these structures. The interest in nestedness in mutualistic systems is
based at least in part on the possible relationship between structural properties of eco-
logical systems and their functional dynamics. In particular, an important question is
whether nestedness contributes to stability and the sustainability of diversity (Pascual
& Dunne 2006, among many others). Although there is some evidence that nestedness

contributes to the stability of mutualistic systems (Bastolla et al. 2009; Bascompte et
al. 2003), it seems that the real effect is not from nestedness itself, but from an increase
in the mean number of mutualistic associations per species, thus making each species
less vulnerable (James et al. 2012). Staniczenko et al. (2012) reach the same conclusion
that connectance, not nestedness itself, is important for persistence (their supplement,
p. 25). This is essentially the “spreading of risk” as a stabilizing mechanism, like the
greater food security of polyphagy versus monophagy, avoiding dependence on very
few species in any mutualism (den Boer 1968). (Remember the story about a tree that
required the Dodo as a seed disperser and risked its own extinction following the loss
of the Dodo; whether the story is true or not.) If the populations of the generalists on
either side of the relationship are stabilized in this way, the antisymmetry of specialists
interacting mainly with generalist counterparts may help stabilize those populations too,
if only indirectly (Bascompte & Jordano 2014, Chapter 3).
Even if the spreading of risk is part of the explanation for nestedness in mutualist
interactions, the same logic would not apply to antagonistic relationships such as para-
sitism, where an excess of such interactions could lead to extinction, rather than to sta-
bility. This thinking might lead to a prediction that negative interactions are less likely to
exhibit nestedness, and there seems to be some evidence that this is true, although many
host-parasite networks show nested structure and uneven edge distributions (Graham
et al. 2009; Poulin 2010). It seems, however, that host-parasite networks more frequently
exhibit “anti-nested” patterns than mutualistic networks (e.g. McQuaid & Britton 2013;
see Poulin & Guégan 2000), although the concept of anti-nestedness can itself be con-
troversial or unclear (Almeida-Neto et al. 2007). In general, however, “anti-nestedness”
refers to a structure which is less nested than a random set of associations, often due to
compartmentalization in the data or matching modularity (see Figure 7.2).
Several different measures of nestedness have been proposed and periodically evalu-
ated. Bascompte and Jordano (2014) have provided a useful and brief summary of the
choices available (their Appendix C; see also Ulrich et al. 2009). One of the most pop-
ular is the nestedness temperature calculator (Atmar & Patterson 1993), which draws
on an analogy between the disorder of an observed binary interaction matrix, compared
to an isocline in its reordered form, and the temperature related to physical disorder.
(Figures 7.3 to 7.5 give the binary interaction matrix in pictorial form, with ﬁlled circles
representing observed interactions and empty circles representing those absent from the
data.) This temperature measure has been criticized for its dependence on the black box

of its software (Almeida-Neto et al. 2007), although it has been improved by compar-
ison to reference values from a population of randomizations (Bascompte et al. 2003).
An attractive alternative is the node overlap, decrease ﬁlling (NODF; Almeida-Neto
et al. 2008), which is more directly deﬁned as

where Mij = 0 if di = dj, and Mij = cij / min(di, dj) otherwise, with the d’s being the
nodes’ degrees and cij is the number of interactions shared by the two nodes. This NODF
measure is essentially the all-pairs average of the pairwise relative nestedness described
in Box 10.2 of Dale and Fortin (2014). Rigidly nested data produce NODF = 1.0. A
moderately nested structure will give values in the middle of the range from 0 to 1 (e.g.
0.65 in Figure 7.3), and complete exclusively modularity gives the value 0 (Figure 7.4).
It is possible to have nested interaction structures within separate modules, which will

give low but non-zero values (see Figure 7.5; two modules of Figure 7.3, NODF =
0.325).
Other measures are available, but the main advice is to be consistent in application
and to understand the features to which the index may respond as well as the well-
discussed strengths and weaknesses.
7.1.2
Modularity and Compartments
Modularity is often used as a measure of the extent to which the nodes of the graph
can be divided into subsets such that the proportion of edges within subsets, compared
to edges between subsets can be maximized (see Chapter 1); the identiﬁed subsets or
modules do not need to be totally separate. In general, it is the sum over modules of
the difference between the observed fraction of edges within modules and the expected
value of that fraction. Because we are dealing with bipartite structures, the expected
value requires evaluating the two parts (call them A and P, for animal vs plant) sepa-
rately, using their within-module degree totals, DA,m and DP,m:
M =
m−max

m
em
E −DA,m
E
DP,m
E

.
(7.2)
The sum is over all modules, indexed by m, with em edges out of the total E in the whole
graph.
In addition to the index of modularity as a general measure, there are many techniques
available to detect and characterize the modules or compartments themselves that can
be found in networks, including the bipartite networks of interest here. For example, in a
study of the fruit ﬂies associated with the ﬂowerheads of one tribe of the Asteraceae (the
Vernonieae, the Ironweed tribe) in mountains of Brazil, Prado and Lewinsohn (2004)
used Correspondence Analysis (CA) to detect compartments and a multi-response per-
mutation procedure to conﬁrm their distinctness. In the data of 35 insect and 81 plant
species, they found six well-delimited compartments that were shown to be related to
single sub-tribes or genera of the plants. They did not proceed to determine the degree of
nestedness of the data, either for the full network or within the network compartments,
but the results presented in their Table 1 suggest signiﬁcant nestedness at least within
compartments. For example, there are several insects that are themselves generalists but
that are found on plants that only host a single insect species. An obvious suggestion
when modularity is encountered in either mutualistic or antagonistic interactions is to
determine whether the modularity can be related to the phylogeny of one or both of the
interacting groups (see Bellay et al. 2011).
Nestedness may be seen as an alternative to modularity or compartmentalization,
where there are identiﬁable subsets of species in both strata of the bipartite graph, with
edges occurring mainly between matching subsets. The two are not completely exclu-
sive because either they coexist, provided one or other characteristic is not extremely
strong; or nestedness can exist within the compartments of a modular structure (see
Figure 7.5).

7.1 Internal Structure of Bipartite Graphs

7.1.3
Asymmetry
This term has many different meanings in the application of graph theory to bipartite
graphs, but it is an important feature of mutualistic and antagonistic interaction net-
works in its variety of forms (Thompson 2006):
1 Interaction strength asymmetry. The effects on the two participants may be very
different in strength, resulting in a kind of asymmetry, even if qualitatively the effects
are of the same sign, such as the (+, +) of mutualism. Bascompte and Jordano (2014)
suggested a measure for this property in plant-animal interactions, based on the dif-
ference between the proportions of interaction events accounted for (their Appendix
A). Where bij = aij/Ai and bji = aij/Aj are the proportions of interactions for species i
and for species j accounted for by the aij interactions between the two, this asymmetry
is Sij = |(bij – bji)|/max (bij, bji). Some authors refer to this as dependence asymmetry.
The overall asymmetry measure for all species is then the mean of all these pairwise
values (see Dormann et al. 2009).
2 Web asymmetry. In a bipartite interaction graph, asymmetry may be in the difference
in the numbers of participants in the two parts of the graph, call them n1 and n2.
A simple measure of that asymmetry is (n1 −n2)/(n1 + n2). If the two sides are
equal, the asymmetry is zero. Bascompte and Jordano (2014) have called this one
web asymmetry (their Appendix A).
3 Degree symmetry and asymmetry. In a bipartite graph of a relationship like para-
sitism, there may be a range of node degree values in both parts of the graph, and one
arrangement of links is to have generalist parasites associated with many-parasite
hosts and greater degrees of specialization creating links between nodes each with
small degree values (Figure 7.6a). This is a kind of degree-based symmetry where
the degrees match. A second possibility is that only high degree nodes in one part (a
host with many parasites) may be adjacent to a low degree node in the other part (a
highly specialized parasite); this is a kind of negative symmetry of node degrees, or
anti-matching (Figure 7.6b). Bascompte and Jordano (2014) referred to the absence
of interactions between specialists in the two parts of the structure as a kind of “asym-
metry”; it is better described as an antisymmetry being more extreme than just the lack
of symmetry (e.g. specialist with specialist, generalist with generalist). A third pos-
sibility is that the distributions of node degrees are qualitatively different in the two
parts of the graph, so that neither matching nor anti-matching are possible (Figure
7.6c). When all the nodes in each part of the graph have the same degree (uniform
distribution) and thus no true specialists or generalists (the interactions are “average-
with-average”), there is a certain symmetry to the structure, but it is not clear that
the term can be meaningfully applied in that circumstance, because the alternative
of asymmetry is not really possible (Figure 7.6d). This version of symmetry and
asymmetry is closely related to nestedness and to the assortative or disassortative
relationship of neighbouring nodes’ degrees (see Johnson et al. 2013). There are many
different measures related to nestedness, but this particular kind of asymmetry may
be quantiﬁed as ½(1 −cor (dj, di) | aij > 0).

7.1.4
Forbidden Links
Another factor to be considered in the interpretation of these bipartite networks is the
phenomenon of forbidden links. The term refers to the fact that many of the interactions
that are not observed are essentially structural zeros (i.e. some combination that cannot
occur), rather than data zeros (i.e. could occur but did not), because the interaction is
ruled out by physical or ecological effects (Olesen et al. 2011b). In pollination biology,
large differences in size or large phenological separation may cause such zeros to occur
(Jordano et al. 2003, 2006; see Bascompte & Jordano 2014). In fact, the phenologi-
cal cycles of the plants and the animals play a key role in the structure and function
of these mutualism networks and it is conceivable that the amount of nestedness or
assortativity can change over time of year within a single network (see Bascompte &
Jordano 2014, Figures 5.3 and 5.5). Under those circumstances, a particular link may
be possible in some weeks of the year when the plant and the animal overlap in suit-
able phase, but may be of the “forbidden” variety at other times (Figure 7.7). Forbidden
links are not unique to these bipartite graphs but can be a factor in almost any ecological
application.
7.1.5
Partner Overlap and Derived Graphs
In trophic networks, we can evaluate the relationship between organisms in the same
trophic layer by looking at the number or proportion of predator species that they share
or at the number and proportion of shared prey species (Chapter 4). In a similar approach
to mutualistic networks, we can evaluate the overlap of the pollinators of any pair of

plants or the overlap of the lists of plants pollinated by any pair of pollinators. To for-
malize this concept, any bipartite graph can be converted to two single-stratum graphs,
one for each part, containing the same nodes, but with no edges between strata; instead,
the edges join nodes in the same stratum where they are adjacent to at least one node in
the original graph (which must be in the other stratum). An example is given in Figure
7.8 (see also Bascompte & Jordano 2014, Figure 3.4). Not only can the edges of the
single-stratum graphs be determined by sharing at least one partner species, the edges
can be given a weight equal to the number that are shared, as shown in Figure 7.8. These
weights, the numbers of shared partner species, can be provide a comparison ratio with
the number of possible partners, to create a measure of the mutualist overlap. For exam-
ple, in the upper stratum of Figure 7.8, A and C share two of the four species (U and

measure of 0.5. In the lower stratum, species U and X share one species (D) of their
combined list of four (A, B, D, E), giving 0.25.
By transforming the bipartite network of plants and pollinators into two correspond-
ing single-stratum graphs (two nodes in the same stratum joined by an edge where they
share a plant or pollinator in the other stratum; see Chapter 3 of this volume), the bipar-
tite graphs can be shown to have a small world property of short average path lengths
(less than 2; see Bascompte & Jordano 2014), suggesting that perturbations of individ-
ual nodes can spread quickly and easily throughout the entire system.

Degree Distributions (First and Second Order) and Assortative Coefﬁcients
The degree of a node is the number of edges that join it to others. The degree of a
node may indicate its importance in the overall structure, and the frequency distribution
of the degrees for the whole set of nodes summarizes a property of the graph itself; for
example, a narrow range of node degrees, indicating a homogeneous structure, contrasts
with having many singletons and very few very highly connected nodes as high degree
hubs. The distribution of degrees can give clues as to the processes that gave rise to the
network, but can also provide information on how the network may perform. It may also
be useful to examine the relationships among the degrees of nodes that are neighbours.
If nodes of similar degrees tend to be adjacent, low with low and high with high, the
graph is assortative for degree. The opposite situation, with a tendency to have low
adjacent to high and vice versa, is disassortative. This property for node degree, or any
other characteristic, is measured by an assortative coefﬁcient.
There are two kinds of analysis that make sense as a consequence of this discus-
sion. The ﬁrst is to plot and then analyze the distribution of node degrees to determine
whether any model provides a good ﬁt. As with other networks, this distribution can
be compared with the reference models of Poisson, exponential, power law, or truncated
power law distributions (others are possible). Bascompte and Jordano (2014) have given
detailed guidance to this process (their Appendix B). For bipartite graphs, it is probably
a good idea to treat the degrees of the two strata separately before combining them.
The second simple analysis is to plot the bivariate distribution of the degrees of adja-
cent nodes. Figure 7.9 shows the bivariate degree distribution plots for the artiﬁcial
examples of structures given in preceding ﬁgures (e.g. Figures 7.1, 7.2, and 7.6). If there
are matching specialists and matching generalists, the degrees of partners will be highly
and positively correlated (ﬁrst panel). If the graph consists of modules or compartments

of approximately equal sizes, the node degrees will both be limited to a small range of
moderate values. Nestedness or antisymmetry for a broad range of degree values gives
a bivariate distribution with no small-valued pairs (third panel). The “asymmetric” case
with uniform distribution paired with a gradation of values produces a rectangular dis-
tribution parallel to one of the axes (fourth panel). Figure 7.9 gives two other cases:
modules of unequal sizes and anti-matching degrees. Obviously, there is more to be
gained from this analysis than just an assessment of positive or negative correlation
between the degrees of adjacent nodes. Newman (2010) discussed these neighbouring
node relationships under the heading of “assortative mixing by degree” (his Section

7.13.3) because the degree of a node can be treated as any other quantitative label. For
large networks and network degree distributions with “heavy tails” (many large values),
the statistical association of neighbour node degrees is better evaluated using Kendall’s
τ rather than the more usual Pearson correlation coefﬁcient (Raschke et al. 2010). There
seems to be the opportunity for more research on this aspect of the structures of these
bipartite graphs.
7.1.7
Motifs
In bipartite graphs of interactions, recall that motifs are not based on triplets of nodes
as they are in standard graphs, but on double pairs of nodes, two nodes from each part.
There are six such motifs possible, as enumerated by Jordano (2010, Figure 3.5). As for
a standard unipartite graph, the ﬁne-scale structure of the bipartite graphs can be charac-
terized by the frequency distribution of these double-pair motifs. Figure 7.10 illustrates
the possibilities. The enumeration of motif frequencies as they occur in a mutualistic or
antagonistic network obviously is one way of quantifying some of the structural proper-
ties of the network, but their occurrence may also have dynamic network implications
(Stouffer & Bascompte 2010), as there should be consistent relationships between net-
work topology and network functioning, at least among networks of the same interac-
tions (see Gómez et al. 2011). This provides another example of the important interplay
of structure and dynamics in ecological networks (topology affects function and func-
tion affects topology) that will be developed further in Chapter 11.

Applications of Bipartite Graphs
7.2.1
Interpretation of Graph Properties with Examples
Just like the desire among ecologists to deduce ecological processes from observed spa-
tial patterns, there is the hope that some aspects of these bipartite graphs are sufﬁciently
distinctive that we can use them to distinguish positive from negative interactions or

7.2 Applications of Bipartite Graphs

facultative from obligate relationships. For example, Poisot et al. (2013) showed that,
in systems of mammalian hosts with gamasid mite ectoparasites, obligate relationships
tended to produce networks that were modular, whereas facultative relationships were
more nested.
Many of the graph-theoretical properties that are of interest for these bipartite graphs
may be informative only for comparisons, not as absolute measures of particular char-
acteristics in a single example.
An interesting hypothesis is that nestedness should have specialist pollinators being
associated only with common species (it’s too risky to specialize on rare plants) but
generalist pollinators can include rare plants. There are two versions to be considered:
(1) rare partners are found mainly associated with speciose hosts (those with many such
partner species) and (2) rare partners can be supported best by abundant hosts (those
with the highest densities). In the literature on mutualism, the former is usually assumed:
specialists interact with species that are subsets of the interaction set of generalists; but
it may be that generalist species are themselves more abundant and more stable because
they can rely on many interactions (Bascompte & Jordano 2014, Chapter 3).
Bascompte et al. (2003) studied 25 plant-pollinator and 27 plant-frugivore mutual-
ism networks and found that they were highly nested, as measured by the nestedness
temperature calculator (Atmar & Patterson 1993), adjusted by expected values from
randomizations. The signiﬁcant nestedness means that both the set of animals and the
set of plants each have a core of generalists. Specialists of either layer do not interact
with corresponding specialists in the other layer, but rather with generalists of that other
group. This means that the network is non-assortative for nodes of low degree (spe-
cialists) because their interactions are with generalists, but assortative for high degree
nodes (generalists) because most of their interactions are with other generalists.
Dormann et al. (2009) studied 19 plant-pollinator networks and came up with similar
ﬁndings:
r The degrees tended to follow a truncated power law.
r There was dependence asymmetry (generalists with specialists and vice versa) and
nestedness.
r Pollinators tended to be complementary.
r The networks studied seemed to be more robust to extinctions than random graphs
would predict.
Vázquez et al. (2009) provided a review of plant-animal mutualisms more generally
(pollination, seed dispersal, plant-ant protection mutualisms) hoping to elucidate the
relationships between pattern and process in these networks. Their observational ﬁnd-
ings can be summarized as:
r The animal species tended to outnumber the plants.
r The degrees tended to follow a truncated power law.
r The connectance was generally low.
r There was dependence asymmetry (generalists with specialists and vice versa) and
nestedness.
.008
15:26:43

160
7 Mutualism, Parasitism and Bipartite Graphs
r As well as nestedness, there was also evidence of modularity.
r The networks exhibited both degree asymmetry and interaction strength asymmetry.
Turning from general reviews to a speciﬁc example, Petanidou et al. (2008) examined
the year-to-year ﬂuctuations of a plant-pollinator network in Mediterranean scrub veg-
etation near Athens. Most striking in the four years’ data is the high turnover in the
interactions observed, both due to species turnover (70 percent) and interactions with
new partners (30 percent), with only 53 percent of plant species common to all four
years, 21 percent of the pollinators and 5 percent of the interactions. But the struc-
tural characteristics of the network itself were remarkably consistent despite the large
changes in the list of actors.
r The insect species outnumbered the plants (about 200 vs about 90).
r The degree centralization, which is the variance of the nodes’ degree centrality scores,
ranged from 0.10 to 0.15.
r The connectance was generally low (around 3 percent).
r There was dependence asymmetry (generalists with specialists and vice versa) and
high nestedness values of 0.97 to 0.98 (based on a “temperature” calculation). The
identity of individual species as generalist or specialist (only one partner) changed
from year to year.
r As well as nestedness, there was also some modularity, with two to six components
in four of the ﬁve years.
r The network diameter remained constant near 8, ranging from 7 to 9, and the average
distance between nodes was constant near 4 (3.49 to 4.04).
With less emphasis on network structural measures, Olesen et al. (2011a) came to sim-
ilar general conclusions from a 12-year study of nectar-feeding butterﬂies and their
nectar-providing plants. Broad characteristics such as species numbers and connectance
stayed fairly constant despite rapid turnover both of linkages among generalist species
and of species themselves. The difference is that there seemed to be a clear difference
between stable generalist species and sporadic specialists (Olesen et al. 2011a).
Fodor (2013) provided some interesting comparisons from the networks of woody
plants with ectomycorrhizal fungi in temperate forests. This was a single site, but the
characteristics observed were:
r The symbiont species outnumbered the host plants (87 vs 7).
r Connectance was high (246 out of 609 = 0.41).
r There was nestedness in both groups with “super-generalists” as hubs in both parts;
overall nestedness was signiﬁcantly high based on “temperature” calculation, at N =
0.83).
r Modularity was weak compared to other bipartite networks, but a useful indicator of
species roles.
In contrast, Toju et al. (2015) found that networks of below-ground plant-fungus asso-
ciations differed from the generally nested topology of above-ground plant-animal net-
works, being anti-nested due to weak modularity. This study included DNA sequence
data on the fungi at three sites along a latitudinal gradient in Japan, with more than
.008

7.2 Applications of Bipartite Graphs
161
30 plant species at each site and hundreds of phylogenetically diverse mycorrhizal and
endophytic fungi.
A last example, again for comparison, is the host-endoparasite networks of Neotrop-
ical marine ﬁsh described by Bellay et al. (2011). They found the following character-
istics:
r The parasite taxa outnumbered the host species (170 vs 39).
r Connectance was low (0.048).
r Nestedness was signiﬁcantly high, with NODF = 5.5.
r Modularity was clearly deﬁned, M = 0.68, with 12 modules identiﬁed, containing
between 5 and 31 species. Here is an example with both signiﬁcant nestedness and
well-deﬁned modules.
The search for generalities for all interaction networks, or even for interaction networks
of the same category, is not always rewarded. It is worth the effort, however, and the
richness is in the comparisons made, even if no unambiguous generality results. For
our own studies, we can calculate “the usual suspects” and interpret the values of the
indices with those in the review summaries (see above), or with those in particular exam-
ples which have biological or environmental similarities to the context of our own. A
main worry for such comparisons is the comparability of the data, not just the taxo-
nomic level and reliability of identiﬁcations, but also the ratio of detection to presence,
the effects of sampling intensity, as well as the inherent variability in the study sys-
tem; there is reason to expect that ecological variability will usually be accompanied
by network structure continuity as it was for Petanidou et al. (2008). Carstensen et al.
(2014) examined the beta diversity of plants, pollinators and their interactions and found
that while the pairwise interactions were highly variable across space, some pairs had
interactions that were “locally frequent and spatially consistent,” possibly representing
“cornerstone” interactions that deserve intense investigation.
7.2.2
Incomplete Data
No study is likely to be sufﬁciently intensive and extensive to detect all the species that
would be of interest, nor all the possible interactions of the species that are encountered.
This means that for these studies, as in much of ecological research, we have only par-
tial and incomplete information on which to base our conclusions. Some of the absent
data points are just missing although possible (data zeros), not forbidden links that are
impossible (structural zeros) (see Olesen et al. 2011b), but often it will not be known
which are which. In Chapter 1, the concept of sub-sampling the known-to-be incomplete
data was introduced, as a way to determine the ﬁndings’ robustness to missing informa-
tion; that suggestion is repeated here, although it cannot distinguish the impossible from
the just missing.
7.2.3
Beyond Mutualism: Parasitism and Other Potentially Antagonistic Relationships
There are obvious similarities between the speciﬁcity or generality of species inter-
actions between hosts and parasites and the characteristics of the various mutualisms
.008
15:26:43

7 Mutualism, Parasitism and Bipartite Graphs
discussed here. We must be cautious, however, about the apparent parallels of pollina-
tion and other mutualistic systems with parasitism and other exploitative relationships.
The advantages of being generalist and speciose as a pollinator host may not obtain with
parasites; more parasites or more types of parasites may create non-linearly disadvanta-
geous effects.
In teaching Introductory Ecology, we try to emphasize that inter-speciﬁc interactions
represent a continuum from almost completely positive effects to almost completely
negative. For example, when one plant species grows on another, the relationship may be
almost fully mutualistic (+, +), as with a cynobacterium or other nitrogen ﬁxer growing
on the bark of a tree; one of commensalism (+, 0) for small epiphytes (if they do not
create too much load stress on the branches); to parasitic (+, –) for lianas, mistletoe and
strangler ﬁgs. Blick and Burns (2009) produced an interesting study that investigated the
network properties for a range of arboreal plants in New Zealand: epiphytes, mistletoes
and lianas. They are different. Mistletoe and liana networks have fewer edges, indicating
stronger host preferences; and they have less nestedness with mutually exclusive host
preferences (negative association between the two). Epiphytes show stronger nestedness
and positive co-occurrence. (Very cool!)
Studies of parasitism networks and the bipartite graphs they produce use many of
the graph-theoretic measures we have discussed for other such networks, including con-
nectance, nestedness, and modularity (e.g. Bellay et al. 2011). In addition, they often
include generality, which is the mean number of interactions per parasite species (mean
degree of nodes in the parasite stratum), and vulnerability, which is the mean number
of interactions per host species (mean degree of nodes in the host stratum), as well as
different measures of interaction strength, such as counts of parasites per host individual
(see Poisot et al. 2013; Canard et al. 2014). As a comment on preference: it seems to be
somewhat misleading to give a graph-theoretical property (mean degree in the host stra-
tum) a name that is really a biological interpretation (“vulnerability”); the identiﬁcation
of the two as if they were actually the same may not always be appropriate.
As well as parasites and parasitoids, antagonistic interactions can be interpreted as
including the relationships between plants and their herbivores. As with studies of hosts
and parasites, this kind of interaction is a bridge from bipartite graphs to graphs of full
trophic networks, raising the problems and promises of how these two kinds of study ﬁt
together (see Poulin 2010).
The (Smart) Things to Do
r Find distinguishing characteristics of the network structure (e.g. nestedness or
compartments).
b Measures of different kinds of symmetry and asymmetry.
b How do these characteristics vary in time and space?
r Determine the ﬁrst-order distribution of the nodes’ degrees.
r Determine common repeated structural elements of the graph, such as motifs’
frequencies.
b Interpret these distributions.
.008
15:26:43

7.3 Concluding Comments
163
r Find key species or species groups in the structure; this can be indicated by high
node degree.
r Quantify patterns of neighbouring node degrees (positive and negative autocorre-
lation).
r Determine the effects of conditions on these bipartite graphs. For example, how
does the structure of a plant-insect pollinator network change along an environ-
mental gradient or when moisture or fertilizer is added?
r Compare structural characteristics with those of other interaction systems.
b Can they be used to distinguish mutualisms from antagonisms?
b Can they be used to distinguish facultative from obligate relationships?
r How extensive are the changes to the network when a species is lost or a new
species is introduced? Determine which characteristics change and how “far” in
the network the changes are felt.
7.3
Concluding Comments
This is all “good stuff” and clearly well deﬁned as helpful applications of graph-
theoretical principles to ecological studies. The main weakness, if it is really a weakness,
is that by concentrating on the interactions between the strata of a bipartite graph, we
are omitting all the other interactions: competition between the pollinators, competition
between the plants, the predators and parasites of both, and so on. Some studies that
have begun with mycorrhizal associations have been heading in the direction of consid-
ering the broader context within which mutualistic interactions occur (see Southworth
et al. 2005; Gehring et al. 2014), even to the extent of including external environmen-
tal factors (drought). Including more categories of interaction in a single analysis is a
tall order but in this era of big data, it is something that needs to be considered as a
way to understanding the functions and dynamics of complete ecological communities
(see van Veen et al. 2006 on the range of interactions in insect communities). Already
cited is the work of Kéﬁet al. (2015) in describing the known trophic network and
non-trophic interaction network of more than 100 species in a rocky intertidal commu-
nity; the non-trophic interactions were highly non-random both when considered alone
and when combined with the trophic network edges, suggesting a promising approach to
developing a comprehensive network approach in ecology. Chapter 11 will discuss com-
bining the concepts from the several species interaction chapters (Chapters 3–7) and the
“location” chapters (Chapters 8–10), by examining the relationship between structure
and dynamics in these systems and their extended networks.

Temporal and Time-Only Graphs
Introduction
Ecological phenomena and processes occur in both space and time, whether or not the
spatial or temporal locations are acknowledged explicitly in the methods used to study
them. Where the previous ﬁve chapters (Chapters 3–7) were concerned with the aspatial
and atemporal graphs of species interaction networks, this is the ﬁrst of three chapters
about locational graphs, graphs in which the nodes at least have locations in time or in
space, or both.
Some ecological phenomena are essentially or exclusively temporal, without explicit
spatial locations, and are best portrayed by temporal graphs. Such time-only graphs and
temporal (aspatial) networks emphasize the order and timing (relative or absolute) of the
functioning of graph or network components, and thus are the right format for formal-
izing schemes of possibility, causation and combinations of events that are impossible
due to temporal order. Important to applications of these graphs is the orderliness of the
ecological phenomenon through time and thus the choice of graph-theoretical measures
that best reﬂect this property. More complex phenomena require that both space and
time be included, giving the spatio-temporal graphs to be covered in Chapter 10.
For many ecological systems, it is necessary to include the dimension of time in
their graphs to help understand the relationships among objects and processes (think of
causal relationships), and also because ecological systems are dynamic with processes
that can change through time. This dimension is usually included by giving the nodes
locations in time, creating temporal graphs, and there are several approaches to working
with the temporal dimension. For example, the set of nodes or the set of edges may
change through time, with the loss or gain of either kind of element, although there are
limitations because the deletion of a node necessarily removes all the edges attached
to it.
Temporal graphs have been introduced in the literature as dynamic graphs (see Harary
& Gupta 1997). The graphs of standard graph theory are static, because they do not
portray changes with time, or because they aggregate events of that occur for short
durations in a summary graph that includes the entire time span (Kostakos 2009; Tang
et al. 2009). These aggregated graphs are really atemporal, because time is not explicit
in their development or interpretation, although they include temporal events. Dynamic
graphs, on the other hand, change in at least some of their characteristics with time.
Dynamic graphs are typically aspatial, but they have a temporal setting for both nodes

and edges. In addition to the usual two sets, V (the nodes) and E (the edges), there can
be functions that assign weights to nodes and edges, call them f and g, increasing the
ﬂexibility of applications for these graphs. A classiﬁcation of dynamic graphs can be
based on the nature of changes in nodes or edges (cf. Harary & Gupta 1997):
r Node dynamic: the set V changes with time, with nodes being gained or lost.
r Node-weight dynamic: node weights change with time as their weight function f
varies.
r Edge dynamic: the set E changes, in that edges can be gained or lost.
r Edge-weight dynamic: edge weights change with time as their weight function g
varies.
r Fully weight dynamic graph: both f and g weight functions can vary with time.
Much of the recent development in temporal graphs, however, has been for sets of nodes
that can be treated as constant, with the edges being pairwise contacts such as phone
calls or e-mails between individuals, recorded for discrete time periods (summarized
in Holme & Saramäki 2013). Rather than treating the nodes as persistent, the same
structure can be described as persistent objects with associated nodes that have temporal
locations; the nodes then appear and disappear during the recorded activity, such as the
phone calls mentioned above. Figure 8.1 illustrates this description with ﬁve persistent

8 Temporal and Time-Only Graphs
objects, connected from time to time by time-located interactions, each with two nodes
and a single edge. Here, either there is no directional implication (Figure 8.1a) or a
direction can be made explicit (A to B distinct from B to A; Figure 8.1b). This chapter
will focus on these edge-dynamic graphs, with time treated mainly as discrete intervals.
Further augmentations of the basic concept of temporal and dynamic graphs have
been proposed, such as dynamic digraphs (the edges have directions) and dynamic
signed graphs (the edges are positive or negative) in the same basic classes listed, and
thus providing many structural types in this scheme. In fact, the most familiar ecologi-
cal example of a dynamic graph is probably the trophic network (see Chapter 4), which
is a dynamic aspatial network with varying weights on the nodes representing species
biomass and varying weights on the edges representing rates of consumption which
ﬂuctuate with prey availability and predator switching behaviour. In this example, how-
ever, the temporal locations of the nodes may be aggregated or inexplicit, and these are
the edge-dynamic graphs of the previous classiﬁcation (Harary & Gupta 1997). The ter-
minology for these graphs is diverse. Kostakos (2009) referred to temporal graphs and
Casteigts et al. (2011) preferred time-varying graphs, but also used the term of dynamic
networks (Casteigts et al. 2011) where Kempe et al. (2002) preferred temporal networks.
They can also be called time-only graphs to emphasize the lack of a spatial dimension
or time-ordered networks (Blonder & Dornhaus 2011) emphasizing the fact that the
order of the contacts, which the edges represent, has important effects on the outcomes
(Nicosia et al. 2013). Because of the emphasis on the order of edges, these may be
called time-ordered graphs. Whatever the terminology, these graphs enable researchers
to study changes and continuity through time, and in an ecological context, they can
provide the means to examine the dynamics, persistence or recovery of ecological
features.
Order and Orderliness
One of the potentially key features of temporal or time-ordered graphs is the property
of orderliness. As the word itself suggests, orderliness is related to order in the sense of
sequence, the ordering of nodes and of edges, and also to the consistency of sequences
and thus to the predictability of those orders. The absence of orderliness can take dif-
ferent forms, as we can illustrate.
Phone calls, as contacts between individuals and as the mode for information ﬂow,
provide a good starting example: the order of the contacts is known (e.g. A to B, then
B to C, then C to D, then D to E), but not what items of information were transferred
or in which direction. Given the A to E order of contacts just listed, the most orderly
structure would seem to be the transfer of the one item of information, x1, from A to
B to C to D to E (Figure 8.2a). Alternatives to this orderly chain would be changes in
the item transferred somewhere in the chain, for example, x2 instead of x1, delivered
from C to D, and then on to E (Figure 8.2b); or a change in the direction of information
ﬂow, for example, x3 from C to B, when the second contact occurs, thus breaking the
chain of information ﬂow (Figure 8.2c). Disorder in the sequence of contacts disrupts
the potential ﬂow of information; the orderliness here is the sequence of contacts in a
time-dependent path.

Ecological Examples
In this chapter, I describe some smart things that can be done with graph theory, playing
in only the temporal dimension, before proceeding to space and then to both space and
time in the following chapters. There are some notable examples of ecological systems
and phenomena in which the temporal graph approach is most useful.
The ﬁrst is well documented in the literature: the spread of disease through the
same structure of contacts depicted in the basic temporal graph, as originating from
the study of social networks (Klovdahl 1985; Keeling 2005; Krause et al. 2007; New-
man 2010, Chapter 17). In these graphs, contacts occur between pairs of individuals in
discrete time, with any contact having the potential to change the state of the individu-
als involved, for example, from susceptible to infected. These studies have been greatly
facilitated by developing technologies such as proximity loggers that can quantify the
interactions between individual animals and the inferred contacts (Drewe et al. 2012;
Ryder et al. 2012). Temporal networks provide exactly the right approach to conceptual-
ize and understand these proximity and contact time data. The second fascinating appli-
cation of this approach is to the study of the behaviour of social insects, both individual
and collective (Blonder & Dornhaus 2011; Charbonneau et al. 2013). The applications
from social network studies can be adapted for repeated asymmetric animal behavioural
interactions such as grooming, which can be counted as a third application (Wey et al.
2008; Krause et al. 2007).
The fourth is time-ordered graphs of bipartite systems, such as plants and pollinators
(Figure 8.3, shown in a different form in Figure 8.4), with changes in network structure
throughout the ﬂowering season, or from year to year (Olesen et al. 2008; Petanidou
et al. 2008). For example, it is easy to imagine the plants and the pollinators each form-
ing a temporal series from early season to late, with the edges between them (pollination
events) also forming a consistent early to late sequence as in Figure 8.3. This is “orderly”
in every way. This also illustrates a kind of homophily or positive assortativeness (like

acteristics (e.g. early vs late). Real examples may not be so neat, but the matching of
orders in both sets of nodes and in the edges of the graph can be evaluated for any such
example. For plants and pollinators, the standard “phone call” model needs to be modi-
ﬁed to take account of the restrictions on where (or when) the contact edges can appear
in the temporal structure. These changes will also affect the randomization procedures
that can be meaningfully applied.
The ﬁfth application is also from behavioural ecology, and looks at the “broadcast
contact” structures, such as alarm calls among animals within groups (and perhaps
chemical alarms as plant communication). In the electronic communication literature,
this is parallel to multi-recipient e-mails. Again the basic model needs to be somewhat

modiﬁed to allow a single source of information (the source node) to have simultaneous
contacts with several other (receiver) nodes, as in Figure 8.5, providing two different
kinds of nodes for any broadcast contact event. The phenomenon of alarm signals,
including various kinds of audible calls, is common in birds and mammals, and the
response of the receivers, upon hearing an alarm call, varies with the “reputation” or
status of the sender of the alarm, the signal in the alarm and the kind of danger it indi-
cates, and the maturity or sophistication of the receiver (Hollén & Radford 2009). A
further slight modiﬁcation of the broadcast communication structure can be one that
distinguishes between instances of “call and answer” versus “call with no reply,” as in
Figure 8.6 (think of ﬂocks of geese: “Here am I; where are you?”; see Lorenz 1991). In
addition to two kinds of nodes (source and receiver), there are now two kinds of edges
(answered and not answered). An interesting question to pursue in such a system is the

The (Smart) Things to Do
r Find distinguishing characteristics of the network and its temporal structure (par-
tial list below).
r Determine key features of the graph for the dynamics of interest.
r Determine the “busiest” nodes, or the nodes that are in the positions of most con-
trol.
r Identify and characterize individual nodes or common forms of interlinked sets of
nodes (temporal motifs) with unusual properties or mere prevalence.
r Use randomizations (more than one) to determine the “signiﬁcance” of the
observed properties.
r Compare temporal characteristics of one system with those of other ecological
systems. Can we use the comparisons to determine causality?
8.1
Properties of Temporal Graphs
A list of the characteristics of these temporal graphs that will be of interest for ecological
applications will look very familiar. Many are properties or measures already encoun-
tered in earlier chapters in an atemporal form. For example, the list of graph metrics for
temporal networks provided by Nicosia et al. (2013) includes temporal path length, tem-
poral distance, temporal connectedness, graph components, motifs, temporal clustering,
centrality measures, betweenness and so on. There is, however, a smaller subset of these
that exist only for the temporal context, such as burstiness, persistence, and topological
overlap and related measures of temporal autocorrelation of the network edges (Nicosia
et al. 2013). As with the names of the kinds of graphs under discussion, there is much
variability in the terms that are used, probably because the area is developing so rapidly;
but here we will follow what seems to be currently most orthodox.
As with any graph, there are nodes, N of them, and edges between pairs of nodes,
potentially N(N −1)/2 of them. The full length of time under consideration starts at
0 and ends at T, and for current purposes, time is in discrete intervals. Each pair of
objects represented by nodes may interact (appropriately deﬁned for the study under
way) in any time interval, called a contact, and each time interval has its own graph, or
time slice of the whole, with edges corresponding to contacts within it. Of course the
“contact” of record may be more than just touching, for example, the transfer of certain
information or material; or it may be less, for example, mere proximity (see the San
Francisco taxi example in Tang et al. 2013). A static aggregated graph can be derived to
summarize the entire time, in which the edge for each pair of nodes has a list of contact
times associated with it, as in Figure 8.7 which summarizes the contacts in Figure 8.1;

the list can also be converted to a simple weight of the total length of contact time. An
edge with no contacts throughout the whole time period is essentially a null edge in the
aggregated graph. Time-aggregated graphs summarize the overall structure, but only
somewhat; these summary graphs can provide misleading results for predicted system
dynamics because the real dynamics on temporal graphs depends on the topology of the
individual time slices (see Holme & Saramäki 2011).
Because time is often measured in discrete intervals, a different set of edges may
be used to join instances of the same object at different times or in different time
“slices” (see dotted lines in Figure 8.3). These are “edges of identity,” called “identity
arcs” by Moody (2008) and “interslice connections” by Mucha et al. (2010), but they
are not usually necessary in time-only graphs and are seldom made explicit. They are
much more important in spatio-temporal graphs in which identiﬁable individuals move
through space as well as forward in time, and identity edges help keep track (literally)
of where individuals are or of “which are which.”
The most important concept for these time-ordered graphs is that of the temporal
path, which must take into account the order in which links or contacts between nodes
appear, these are also called time-respecting paths. These paths are a sequence of nodes
and the pairwise contacts between nodes (along edges) such that the times of the con-
tacts (in their path order) are non-decreasing. Obviously, if the contacts are not all con-
temporaneous in the path, it becomes asymmetric and the reachability of node A from
node B does not imply the reachability of node B from node A. Similarly, transitivity is
not guaranteed: temporal paths from A to node B and from B to C do not imply a path
from A to C if the A to B path occurs after B to C. Figure 8.8 illustrates this property for
simple temporal paths.
The sensitivity of paths to temporal order requires a modiﬁcation of measures of
centrality, too. Based on Kim and Anderson (2012) and Tang et al. (2009), and the
usual model for temporal graphs of persistent nodes and contact edges in discrete time,
different measures of centrality can be deﬁned.

8.1.1
Centrality Measures for Temporal Graphs
These are the same as described in Chapter 3, Table 3.1, but distance is now interpreted
as temporal distance:
Betweenness Centrality: The temporal betweenness centrality of node v is the pro-
portion of the shortest temporal paths between any pair of nodes in G that pass
through node v.
For applications related to information ﬂow, the shortness of the path should be com-
bined with the shortest of retention times at the node before the information is
relayed to the next node in the path.
Closeness Centrality: The temporal closeness centrality measures the average tempo-
ral distance from node v to all other nodes. Nodes with shorter temporal distance
on average have a greater centrality in the temporal graph.
Eigenvector (Spectral) Centrality: Includes all possible paths in its measure, not
just the shortest paths, accounting for the greater importance of shorter paths by
(down-) weighting each path by a factor based on its length, λ: αλ for some con-
stant α.
Broadcast (Source) Centrality and Receive (Sink) Communicability
Broadcast Centrality is a measure of how well node i can communicate to all oth-
ers, based on communicability. The count of all temporal paths of any length is
expressed by the communicability matrix, Q (Grindrod et al. 2011; Nicosia et al.
2013):
Q ≡[I −αA (t0)]−1[I −αA (t1)]−1 . . . [I −αA (tm)]−1.

(Grindrod et al. 2011; Nicosia et al. 2013). As for paths in a digraph consisting of
directed edges, in a temporal graph, there are several kinds of connected components
for any node I: the out-component of I is the set of all nodes, J, for which there is a tem-
poral path from I to J; the in-component of I is the set of all nodes, J, for which there
is a temporal path from J to I (Nicosia et al. 2012). A strongly connected component
has temporal paths in both directions between any pair of nodes within it. These com-
ponents represent the most highly connected subgraphs, and are related to the internal
“community structure” of temporal graphs representing social interactions (Nicosia et
al. 2012), and those authors describe a method to ﬁnd these components in temporal
graphs and provide some examples of the application and outcomes.
Another consequence is that any path has two kinds of length: (1) topological length,
which is the number of edges traversed, and (2) temporal length, which is the time taken
to traverse it. For example, in Figure 8.9, the path A – B – E has topological length 2, but
temporal length 5. As a result, there are two measures of distance between two nodes:
the topological distance is the length of the topologically shortest path between them,
and the temporal distance is the length of their temporally shortest path. For example,
in Figure 8.9, the topological distance between A and E is 1 (by the path A – E, with
temporal length 7) and the temporal distance between A and E is 4 (by path A – B – C –
D – E, with topological length 4). Different deﬁnitions of short temporal paths are pos-
sible and some refer to the fastest path (Wu et al. 2014). Figure 8.9, with accompanying
tables, illustrates some of these concepts. The term latency refers to the shortest time
required to go from A to B by a time-respecting path. There may be challenges in com-
puting shortest temporal paths, but comparing them with the distances in the associated
static summary can be very revealing (Wu et al. 2014), with the characteristics of the
aggregated graph being possibly very different from the characteristics of the temporal
graphs it summarizes. This result echoes the important understanding that the dynamics
on temporal graphs depend on the topology in the time slices, so that time-aggregated
graphs can provide misleading results (Holme & Saramäki 2011). In ordinary static
graphs, a useful measure of graph “size” is the characteristic path length, which is just
the average distance between all possible pairs of nodes. In temporal graphs, many pairs
may have no temporal path between them, giving a distance of  (for example nodes
C and G in Figure 8.9 are mutually unreachable), and so the average may not be help-
ful, although we might use the average of those that are ﬁnite. Nicosia et al. (2013),

suggested using the average of the distances’ inverses, dij−1, then called the temporal
efﬁciency. Pairs of nodes with no path between them now contribute zero to the average.
8.1.2
Burstiness and Persistence
Measures related to temporal distances between pairs of nodes are important evaluations
of the structure of the graph, but there are also properties based on the distribution of the
actual contacts between pairs of nodes. The ﬁrst is the comment that contacts in many
time-ordered systems tend to be “bursty”: the distribution tends to have a “heavy tail”
with more contact events far apart in time (Nicosia et al. 2013). (I think the implication
is also that there are temporal clusters of contacts that are closer together than expected
from randomness; think of the “broken stick” statistics for one dimension; Dale & Fortin
2014, Section 4.4.1.) A measure of this characteristic can be based on the distribution
of the waiting time between consecutive contact events of any pairs, τ, call it P(τ). For
a Poisson process, the waiting time follows an exponential distribution, and of course,
for a Poisson distribution the variance and the mean are the same. The logical approach
is to then base a burstiness measure on the coefﬁcient of variation of the waiting times
(Min & Goh 2013), which is the ratio of the standard deviation, sτ, and the mean mτ,
giving
B = (sτ/mτ −1) ÷ (sτ/mτ + 1) .

Figure 8.10 Time-ordered graphs: bursts of contacts and persistence through discrete time. The
contacts occur in bursts, and some contacts (e.g. B −C) are persistent, appearing in adjacent
time units.
This parameter runs from −1 when the events are perfectly regular, through 0 when they
are independent, to +1 for maximum burstiness (Min & Goh 2013).
The second property is the feature that contacts tend to be “persistent,” with higher
frequencies of contacts between I and J at time t + τ when there is already contact
between them at time t. Figure 8.10 gives an example in which the inter-pair contacts
occur in bursts and in which some contacts are more persistent than others (e.g. B to
C and D to E). This characteristic of persistence is essentially temporal autocorrela-
tion among the times of contact for the same pair of nodes, and Nicosia et al. (2013)
introduced a temporal autocorrelation measure, Ci(tm,tm + ࢞t), which they refer to as
“topological overlap” for node I at time t. This measure becomes a “temporal [auto-]
correlation coefﬁcient” when averaged over all times at node I to give Ci for node I, and
then averaged over all nodes, to give C as a measure for the whole graph. The concept
of homophily or positive assortativeness of neighbour nodes for temporal graphs can
include the proximity in time of the nodes’ edges, as well as other characteristics such
as aggregate degree.
In addition to the autocorrelation of the contacts themselves, Min and Goh (2013)
suggested examining the autocorrelation of the waiting times, τ, as a complement to
the measure of burstiness. The measure they propose is just the correlation coefﬁcient
of successive waiting times, τ k and τ k+1, and they refer to it as a memory coefﬁcient,
M, which can be positive or negative, reﬂecting the short-term autocorrelation. They
suggested comparing temporal sequences in a bivariate plot of burstiness, B, and mem-
ory, M, since the two are more or less independent. They provide examples of different
phenomena plotted in a “burstiness map space” (M vs B) in two dimensions, which does
prove informative and seems worth pursuing for ecological data.
Temporal autocorrelation is a key feature of these time-ordered networks, noting that
it can be positive, indicating persistence, or negative, indicating rapid change. For exam-
ple, a temporal graph of a community trophic network with several panels representing
different time periods makes it possible to evaluate, for each “location” in the network,
.009
15:26:46

176
8 Temporal and Time-Only Graphs
the degree and speciﬁcity of the greatest change in and the greatest persistence of char-
acteristics. The continuity represented by persistence can be thought of as the system’s
“memory” more generally than just waiting times: the extent to which past behaviour
of the system affects current and future processes, thus persisting through a number of
realizations or observations of the processes.
If temporal autocorrelation is very strong, the result may be contact edges that persist
more or less continuously through a number of time slices. Just as the phenology of
individual plant or insect species of a pollination network can be portrayed as parallel
line segments running through time (Figure 8.11a) (see also Olesen et al. 2008, Figures
3b and 3c), the observed pairwise pollination interactions can be portrayed in the same
way. In the case of discontinuities in actual observations, it may be reasonable to assume
continuity that is just not observed. The result for either the species or their pairwise
interactions is a sheaf of parallel line segments depicting the phenomenon’s duration,
as well as start and stop time. In some applications, the temporal overlap of strings of
contact edges can be an important characteristic of the overall structure. Then, there may
be good reason to extend the concept of “overlap” as it applies in these graphs, beyond
its introduction by Nicosia et al. (2013) in the context of autocorrelation. Earlier in this
book (somewhere!), the concept of an “interval graph” was described. This graph is
based on a set of N intervals on the real line, like a set of ﬁnite line segments. The
nodes of the interval graph are these intervals or line segments and an edge joins any
pair of nodes for which the line segments overlap (see Figure 8.11b). This approach
does not usually distinguish between cases of partial overlap, like segments A and B,
and cases of complete overlap, like segment E which is completely within the range of
segment D; but it easily could by using different edge designations. There are a number
of statistics already available to summarize the characteristics of possibly overlapping
line segments (see Dale & Fortin 2014, Section 9.2.3.2), and the analogy with possibly
overlapping time periods (of contact) in a temporal graph is obvious, but the relationship
will need further clariﬁcation if only because the time segments in a temporal graph can
be intermittent.
8.1.3
Motifs
Previously, the concept of a “motif” in a graph was described as a subgraph of consis-
tent structure that was repeated as many instances in a single graph or in a family of
graphs based on similar applications. In time-ordered graphs, a “temporal motif” is a
class of isomorphic subgraphs that are topologically similar and have the same order of
corresponding contacts (Nicosia et al. 2013; Kovanen et al. 2011). For ecological appli-
cations, such as studies of the spread of disease, temporal networks with “coloured”
(labelled) nodes are of particular interest (see Kovanen et al. 2013a), such as individu-
als with the three labels of disease progression: S = susceptible, I = infected, or R =
removed (recovered or deceased). In such a case, there can be different motifs with the
same topological and temporal structure distinguished by the labels on the nodes (e.g.
Figure 8.12). Then, we can ﬁnd the answers to interesting questions such as whether
the presence of the disease affects behaviour or system dynamics as shown by changing
frequencies of the temporal motif frequencies.

Obviously, the motifs that are of interest will be different for different applications. For
example, the temporal motifs for broadcast alarm signals will have many more edges
than the common motifs in bipartite graph applications. The simplest motifs for two
time units are shown in Figure 8.13; if the node labels are ignored, there are six with the
six descriptions given there. If node labels are considered, or if the nodes have distinct
“colours,” there are more than six. In studying human social networks as revealed by
mobile phone contacts, Kovanen et al. (2013b) found that temporal motif frequencies
revealed both homophily (greater than expected similarity of node characteristics when
joined by a contact event), and gender-speciﬁc patterns. For example, an analysis of the
two-edge motifs (those in Figure 8.13) with 24 node types (classiﬁed by gender, age
group and payment type) found an over-representation of both chain and star formats

(bottom four in Figure 8.13) for all nodes being female. Although this is obviously not
an ecological example, the approach and application can obviously be transferred to
many ecological phenomena with behavioural or social structural components.
With labels included, so that repeated contact is distinguishable (if necessary) from
contact returned, the repeated contact motif in the basic time-ordered graph is a build-
ing block of what was termed “persistence,” which is temporal autocorrelation of edges
across time slices. In the bipartite temporal graph of predation, parasitism or mutu-
alism such as pollination, the directionality of any edge is implicit, and the repeated
directional contact remains the structural basis of longer-term persistence. Figure 8.14
introduces an example (which will return later) of plant-pollinator interactions in arctic
tundra (from Olesen et al. 2008) observed over several dates through the short summer.

Persistence between time units is an obvious feature of the data, but limited by the strong
effect of the seasonal progression.
8.2
Techniques for Temporal Graphs: Testing Signiﬁcance
The simplest version of testing signiﬁcance in temporal graphs is the use of restricted
randomizations for the characteristics of interest. These may be characteristics of the
whole graph such as path length, the burstiness of events, or the frequencies of classes
of motifs; or characteristics associated with individual nodes, or edges or time slices.
These include centrality measures for nodes or edges, local indices of persistence and
autocorrelation (local by node, edge or time slice), and topological properties such as
connectivity or connectedness within a time slice. The combination of frequency enu-
meration and the comparison of observed and expected values can also be used, but the
restricted randomization approach is more general and has much to recommend it.
8.2.1
Random Assignment and Restricted Randomizations
As already hinted, one of the key methods for the analysis of these graphs, and one of
the strengths of this general approach, is the application of more than one randomization
procedure (Holme & Saramäki 2011). Having a choice of procedures allows a choice of
which characteristics are to be preserved by the algorithm used, and makes a hierarchical
analysis possible. It is worth describing several of these algorithms in detail and for
comparison. The following material is based on Holme and Saramäki (2011) with some
modiﬁcation for conventions, and some additional comments.
“Randomized Edges” (RE) is the ﬁrst method in their list, and it is based on swapping
the end-nodes of pairs of contact edges. It can be thought of as a “re-wiring” approach,
since the contact edges are the focus, not the nodes themselves. Proceeding sequentially
through all possible contact edges (I, J), for each, a second edge (K, L) is chosen at
random. The edges (I, J) at time T and (K, L) at time Y are then replaced with probability
0.5 by (I, L) and (K, J) or by (I, K) and (J, L) at the original times, T and Y. If a self-edge
or multiple edge results from this replacement, a new (K, L) is chosen and the process
repeated. Figure 8.15a provides an illustration of this randomization.
For contact edges that are not directed, this algorithm preserves the degree of each
node as well as the number of contact edges in each time unit, but not the number
of times each pair of nodes are in contact. For directed edges, depicting the follow of
information, for example, the node degrees are not necessarily conserved. For example,
if edges (I, J) and (K, L) are replaced by (I, K) and (J, L), node K becomes a sink node
where it was a source, so its in-degree decreases by one and its out-degree increases by
one. Node J becomes a source node where it was a sink, so its in-degree increases by
one and its out-degree decreases by one. A solution is to offer two choices, each with
probability 0.5: (I, L) and (K, J), as above, or (I, J) and (K, L), the original conﬁguration.
Figure 8.15b illustrates the basic algorithm, and also an alternative to consider. The
alternative is to preserve the in-degrees and out-degrees by offering three choices for

the two contact edges: swap the sinks of the two directed edges; swap their sources;
swap both sources and sinks. The last choice is the same as switching the two edges
from times T and Y to times Y and T.
Karsai et al. (2011) described a similar method, which they refer to as “link-sequence
shufﬂed” or “DCB”: entire contact time sequences are exchanged between randomly
chosen pairs of edges. For example, if A and B were originally joined at times 1, 3 and
7, and C and D were joined at times 2, 4 and 8; the randomized version might have A
and B joined at 2, 4 and 8, and C and D at 1, 3 and 7. No novel contact time sequences
are produced, and the ﬁgure for RE in Holme and Saramäki (2011) showed a similar
preservation of the edge contact time sequences (my interpretation of their algorithm
seems to make that possible). On the other hand, the contact sequences associated with
particular nodes can be reorganized in either process; for example, in Figure 8.15c,
any randomization of the node labels in the original conﬁguration would preserve the
common node for edges with link sequences (4, 14, 15), (2, 10,13, 18) and (3, 8, 10).
“Randomly Permuted Times” (RP) is the second method in the Holme and Saramäki
list of randomizations. Here, the times of the observed contact edges are randomly shuf-
ﬂed, preserving the distribution of edge numbers in each time unit, the degrees of each
node, and the number of contacts between each pair of nodes, but breaking up the details
of which pairs of nodes are in contact at which times. It also preserves the burstiness
of the distribution of the contacts through time. This technique is referred to as “time-
shufﬂed” or “DCW” by Karsai et al. (2011). Figure 8.15d illustrates this randomization
and shows how the distribution of positions of contact events remains unchanged along
the time axis.
A third choice of randomization is to combine the ﬁrst two: RE + RP, with contact
edge randomization preceding the permutation of the contact times (not illustrated). I
think this is the same as the “conﬁguration model” of randomization, also called “D” by
Karsai et al. (2011).
The “Random Times” (RT) technique uses the observed set of contact edges but
repositions them at randomly chosen positions on the time line, thus disrupting any
autocorrelation and any clustering or burstiness of these events through time. Figure
8.15e gives an example of the outcome of this technique and makes it obvious that the
distribution of event timing is not preserved.
The “Random Contacts” (RC) approach is really a modelling technique, rather than
a randomization method, since it essentially creates a new “data set” for comparison,
rather than rearranging observed data. Here, the equivalent number of edges are created
between randomly chosen pairs at randomly chosen times. Restricted versions of this
algorithm are also possible, for example, by having the numbers of random edges per
given time period constrained to be the same as in the observed data (Figure 8.15f).
The list provided by Holme and Saramäki (2011) includes three more randomizations.
Two require very large data sets and may be less of interest for ecological analysis (see
comments in 8.3), but the third is intriguing. Again, it is not really a randomization;
it is “Time Reversal” (TR), running the observed sequence backward (Figure 8.15g).
This can provide the opportunity to determine causal sequences. As a simple example,
if contact (A, B) is frequently followed by contact (B, C) in the observed sequence, but
.009
15:26:46

8.3 Applications of Techniques

never in the reverse, this may provide evidence of a causal connection rather than mere
association of the two edge types. This approach looks beyond temporal autocorrelation
to examine the temporal asymmetry of the sequences. It essentially looks at pairs of
temporal motifs that can indicate causal relationships, as in the chains shown in Figure
8.13. It may be especially useful in cases where the edges have direction, with (A, B)
distinct from (B, A), but that is not essential.
Clearly these various randomization procedures can be applied to data that take the
form of time-ordered bipartite graphs, such as plant-pollinator networks (Figure 8.14),
with some modiﬁcation of their restrictions. In adapting these randomization tests for
bipartite graphs, little change of procedure may be required, but an understanding of
the ecology should be included in making any modiﬁcations. Taking the arctic plant-
pollinator data as an example, while a full randomization for the random times (RT)
approach could be used (Figure 8.15e), it would be more appropriate to constrain the
time of edges by the phenology of the plant and of the insect, so that edges only appear
when the plant is ﬂowering and the insect is active. Similarly, the creation of random
edges in any model needs to be limited by avoiding “forbidden links” (Olesen et al.
2008; Jordano 1987), here including pollination interactions that just cannot happen,
such as a long-tubed ﬂower and a pollinator with short mouth-parts.
It is an easy step, in concept, to go from restricted randomization to a modelling
procedure that includes the same restrictions in the generation of artiﬁcial “data” for
comparison with the observed results.
8.3
Applications of Techniques
Applications of these techniques to ecological data provide some challenges and advan-
tages that may not arise in other data sets. Studies of social networks such as those
reviewed by Holme and Saramäki (2011) or Kovanen et al. (2013b) frequently involve
huge data sets, with possibly billions of contacts (the edges) between millions of phone
users (the nodes). This scale has the disadvantages associated with analyzing huge data
sets, although many of the problems have been solved, but the scale also makes it pos-
sible that very small effects are highly signiﬁcant if they are consistent. Data sets such
as the network of phone calls of millions of users have the additional advantage that
with many nodes, the study duration can be short and still provide large numbers. This
reduces the potential for temporal non-stationarity. Ecological data sets, on the other
hand, will tend to have relatively small numbers of observations, both nodes and edges,
and larger numbers may require longer duration, increasing the risk of non-stationarity.
Our data will also lack the temporal ﬁne-scale precision and accuracy of the electronic
examples, with even hourly observations being rare. As elsewhere in data analysis, tem-
poral networks can have an important but difﬁcult relationship between the scale of the
process being studied, the scale of the data recorded, and the scale at which the analysis
is performed (Caceres & Berger-Wolf 2013; see also Dale & Fortin 2014, Figure 1.8).
Figure 8.14 gives a sample of the results of a study by Olesen et al. (2008) of how an
arctic plant-pollinator network changes through the growing season. The study site was
.009

8 Temporal and Time-Only Graphs
of mixed vegetation in northeastern Greenland and the observation period was deter-
mined by the end of snow-melt and the ﬁrst snowfall. There were 31 species of ﬂowering
plants and 76 pollinating insect species, and a daily census was taken of insect pollinator
visits to all plants in ﬂower. The networks of such contacts in six time slices are pro-
vided in Figure 8.14 for a subset of 10 plants and 20 insects. Sophisticated randomiza-
tion tests are not required to detect the basic characteristics of short-term persistence and
longer-term turnover, with a slow build-up of edges being added to the network followed
by a rapid decline. The authors studied the same system in two consecutive summers
and found remarkable structural similarities between the two instances, despite strong
year-to-year differences in the identities of the pollinators and in the plant-pollinator
links. The degree distributions were best ﬁt by a power law or a truncated power law
model, consistent with the attachment of new pollinators to old plants being interme-
diate between fully preferential and fully independent of node degree. The message to
other ecologists is that this is an approach you might try; you can do this too.
In a different vein, Nicosia et al. (2012) discussed the concepts, methods and some
applications of ﬁnding the various kinds of connected components in time-varying
graphs. Of greatest ecological relevance is their study of components of graphs of the
co-location of individuals through time, humans in this case, but the extension to other
organized and mobile social populations is obvious. The study was of about 100 individ-
uals at MIT during 6 months, with their locations sampled every 5 minutes. Of particular
interest were the sizes of the in- and out-components in the social structure, and how
they change from the work-week (Monday to Thursday) to the weekend (Friday to Sun-
day). In the work-week, almost all the nodes have in- and out-components of size about
72, but around the weekend, the components vary greatly among the different nodes
(Nicosia et al. 2012, Figure 4), and are usually smaller than 72 (approximately 30 to 50
for in-components; 40–60 for out-components). In contrast, the static time-aggregated
graphs usually have a single large component of 70+ in the work-week and around 65
on the weekend. Once again, the static time-aggregated summary can be misleading
when compared to the true dynamics of the system.
Networks, social and otherwise, are important as models for studying and predicting
the behaviour of epidemics in populations, and as frameworks for analyzing observed
patterns of disease spread. Despite the fact that many of the underlying networks of
inter-individual contacts, which are the mechanism of contagion, are actually dynamic
and ephemeral, aggregated static summary graphs of these interactions have been shown
to be very useful in this context (e.g. Craft & Caillaud 2011; Newman 2010, Chapter
17). Disease dynamics, however, may be uneven in both space and time. These net-
works can include the spatial components of structure (see the following Chapters 9
and 10), but the unevenness in time suggests a need to separate the time slices of the
phenomenon. A number of authors have argued that summary networks are a poor sub-
stitute for the changing temporal graphs that provide much better insight into the tempo-
ral structure of inter-individual contacts, and thus into the transmission of disease (e.g.
Karsai et al. 2011; Horváth & Kertész 2014). For example, it has been demonstrated
that “burstiness,” the clustering of events in time, has an effect on the dynamics of dis-
ease spread, in part through the “small world” characteristics, such as short paths, that
.009

can result. The temporal structure of contact events can slow or speed up the spread of
disease (Horváth & Kertész 2014). Depending on the topology, the burstiness tends to
slow the spread of disease and can lead to longer-term persistence (Karsai et al. 2011;
Vázquez 2013); and dynamic centrality measures are good predictors of the ability of
infected nodes to spread the disease through the network, whether based on the pro-
portion of the network infected in a ﬁxed period or the time to infect half the network
(Mantzaris & Higham 2013).
In applied ecology, the studies of proximity and contact networks as temporal struc-
tures have been especially useful in understanding the dynamics of the spread of dis-
eases of economic or conservation importance, and temporal network analysis is ideal
for this purpose, particularly when it can go beyond the time-aggregated summary
graph. The data can be derived from mark-recapture methods, radio-collar tracking
(Perkins et al. 2009), or (more recently and potentially much better) proximity data
loggers. Network analysis has been used to understand the inﬂuence of proximity or
contact on the spread of facial tumour disease in wild Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus
harrisii) (Hamede et al. 2009), bovine TB in brushtail possum (Mycobacterium bovis in
Trichosurus vulpecula) (Porphyre et al. 2008), and the potential effects of social associ-
ation strengths in populations wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) (Marsh et al. 2011).
Similar approaches have been used for the study of parasites and the factors affecting
their transmission through natural populations, reviewed by Godfrey (2013). In many
such applications, whether for disease or macroparasites, the aggregated network is
used, although the importance of non-stationarity, especially in the form of seasonality,
is well understood (Perkins et al. 2009; Hamede et al. 2009). Technological advances
like the automated proximity logger provide data that can be more easily resolved in
to true temporal networks, such as those described here, and will provide an improved
understanding of these highly dynamic systems (see Danon et al. 2011). The required
analysis methods already exist and have been used to analyze human social network
data of various kinds, including physical proximity, for which the data sets can be very
large (see Panisson et al. 2012). Applying these methods to ecological studies should
prove highly informative.

Conclusions and Advice
When the outline of this book was originally sketched, this chapter did not exist. How-
ever, in beginning to put together and to revise the material for the chapter on spatio-
temporal graphs, and in the context of the work on spatial graphs, it became clear that
a chapter on time-only graphs was needed. As often in book writing, research revealed
a very rich, if yet very incomplete, body of work on this topic, which now seems an
essential aspect of applying graph theory in ecological research.
There are other kinds of graphs for ecological applications that include the dimension
of time but not space, including models or ﬁeld-based examples of state transitions.
Here, the nodes of the graph represent some kind of object or unit, which is identiﬁed
as being in one of several possible states. Directional edges indicate the possible or

observed transitions between states for a single object. For example, the top face of a
die can be in one of six possible states; starting with state A (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6), when
the die is rolled, the transitions to all six states (including A itself) should be equally
probable. The transition graph is then a complete digraph with edges in both directions
between every pair of states (30 edges). On the other hand, if the object of interest is a
forest tree which can be in one of three states (healthy, diseased and dead), the transition
graph is not a complete digraph because the third (and ﬁnal) state must have out-degree
zero.
In applied ecology, such as rangeland management, the vegetation of sites is placed
in one of several categories (e.g. shortgrass prairie, tallgrass savanna, oak woodland,
etc.), with the challenge being the quantiﬁcation and prediction of transitions in time
between the identiﬁed states (Phillips 2011). With the states as nodes, and possible tran-
sitions being the edges between nodes, each set of transitions forms a network, and the
structural characteristics of that network can be subjected to analysis using graph the-
ory measures, such as spectral radius and algebraic connectivity (Phillips 2011). Figure
8.16 shows some basic possibilities: (1) a strict sequence where state a can transition
only to b, b to c and so on, with a return to the starting condition possibly requiring
external intervention; (2) a similar sequence, but with shortcuts (e.g. state b to state e)
possible; and (3) a less orderly system in which the original strict sequence is easily
lost. Of course, this model of vegetation dynamics is much less “crisp” than the origi-
nal time-only phone call model; the state transitions may be very indistinct, as may the
point in time at which the transition in fact occurs.
One elaboration of the state transition model is to have the probabilities of different
possible transitions depend on the history of the object represented: the sequence of
states in which it existed previously and the times of the transitions between states. This
is very similar to the familiar higher order Markov model of temporal sequences.

Figure 8.17 Six objects, A to F, each with a transition sequence among ﬁve states, a to e. Edges
are interactions between objects. There are two versions: thick edges and thick + thin. Edge
thickness indicates proportion of time of occurrence.
A second elaboration is to consider more than one object, each with its own sequence
of transitions between states, but those transitions are affected by the interactions
between the objects. Figure 8.17 illustrates the idea with a graph in continuous time
six objects, each with ﬁve possible states and sequences of transitions among them.
Suppose a transition at one object tends to trigger transitions in its network neighbours
or that it tends to “pull” neighbours toward the same state or “push” them toward some-
thing quite different. Then the dynamics of transitions will differ between the sparse
graph with few edges (only the thicker lines) and the more highly connected graph (all
lines). Under these circumstances, the network topology (the positions of edges) will
affect the state transitions at individual nodes and thus the dynamics of the whole net-
work. If the edges are transient in time, and appear and disappear, we can imagine a
situation in which the states of the nodes can affect the topology. For example, if edges
are more likely to form between nodes in similar states, the nodes’ dynamic sequences
will affect topology, with topology having its own effect on the dynamics. The recip-
rocal effects of structure and function can be thought of as their “coevolution” in these
dynamic networks, sometimes called “adaptive networks.” The concept of adaptive net-
works is important in ecology and will be returned to in a later chapter (Chapter 11).
To complement Figure 8.17, Figure 8.18 gives a discrete time example of six objects
with four states. The time unit edges join objects that interact in the time period indi-
cated. The “arm-chair” version of what the ﬁgure represents is a small herd of graz-
ing animals that are monitored both for individual behaviour (the node states) and pair
proximities (the time-located edges), like the proximity logger data described for white-
tailed deer by Tosa et al. (2013). The nodes are the individuals that alternate through
a range of behaviour “states,” such as grazing, moving between habitat patches and
sleeping or resting at one location. The edges indicate time units in which the pair of

individuals registers as being close to each other in the proximity data. There is one
node state (yellow in the colour version of the ﬁgure) that is obvious for having few
proximity records or few changes in proximity, the resting or sleeping state with limited
movement.
To pursue the concept of the coevolution of network topology and network function in
a system of species interactions with state-and-transition node properties, consider six
species of zooplankton that can all prey upon each other depending on their relative sizes
at the time of encounter, which in turn depends on age, life-history stage, and nutritional
history (see Chapter 4). The “states” used could be these features of individuals or
summaries of the whole population for example “all mature adults” or “mostly small
juveniles” or “bimodal in size and age.” The categories of states need not be identical
for all six species. The states could also include division by vertical position in the water
column or geographical location. (Yes, the edges could have directions for greater clarity
of the nature of the interaction.) One obvious way in which function can affect topology
would be for predation rates to switch among potential prey in response to state (e.g.
copepods can adjust the prey size selected in response to abundance; Levinton 1982).
This suggested example may seem a bit fanciful, but the complexity of some ecological
systems is such that this approach might be highly useful, even if abstracted.
As a simpliﬁed artiﬁcial example, Figure 8.19a illustrates the state and function
changes in three species of zooplankton. Species A and B are found in three size classes
and prey on the smaller sizes of the other species, with the smallest being preferred.
Species C is an alternate prey, but less preferred. All seven nodes occur in three states:
absent, rare and abundant. The states of the nodes affect the predation that occurs,
the positions of edges, and the function (predation) affects the states of the nodes as
increases or decreases in abundance. At time 1, the small and large classes of both A
and B are abundant and the large individuals prey preferentially on the small. At time
2, the smallest class is absent, either eaten or grown into the next age class, and the

large individuals, now somewhat reduced in number, prey on the less preferred medium
sizes, now common. The same sort of pattern occurs in time 3, with the medium classes
reduced by growth or predation. The largest classes have been replenished by growth,
but they now rely on the alternate prey, species C. The smallest class begins to re-appear
as reproduction occurs. At time 4, the middle size classes are absent due to mortality
by predation or growth into the large size class, which continues to depend on alternate
prey. Time 5 is the same as time 1, with the small classes restored to abundance, and
now forming the major prey base of the large sizes.
In the whole cycle, each node has its own sequence of state transitions and their
causes, and these are not all the same (Figure 8.19b). While artiﬁcial, this example
mimics real ecological systems in a simpliﬁed form, but it is genuinely time-only, with
the nodes and their states located in time, here imitating a seasonal cycle. The function
of the network, the transitions of the states of the nodes, and the topology of the network
all interact and co-evolve through time. This coevolution of network form and function
(or structure and dynamics) will be discussed further in a later chapter (Chapter 11).
While the state transition models are initially non-spatial, another obvious modiﬁca-
tion is to create a map of the parts of the landscape that are occupied by patches of each
identiﬁed vegetation category. The purpose of a study of the whole landscape might
then be to determine whether there are any spatial neighbour effects on the transitions
as well as effects of the spatial location’s history of states. This then leads to the use of
spatio-temporal graphs to study the history and future of such patches, which will be
addressed in a later chapter.
While there are not yet many ecological examples of temporal graphs, there are
several models of the analysis of other kinds of data available for us to learn from.
Obviously not all temporal graphs are derived from the same form of data, and so the
techniques may not translate directly, but the lessons from the literature can be help-
ful, especially in the suggested use of a hierarchy of restricted randomizations to test
hypotheses and suggest answers to questions. There are obviously many phenomena in
ecology generally, and in behavioural ecology more speciﬁcally where the use of these
time-only networks or temporal dynamic graphs, and the theory that goes with them,
promises to provide important and valuable insights. We can look forward to seeing
more of such studies in the next few years.

Spatial Graphs
Introduction
Ecological phenomena and processes occur in a spatial context, whether or not the spa-
tial location is explicit in the data or the analysis. The spatial structure of ecological
systems is a critical factor in determining the relationships among objects or species
and processes, and important also because there are reciprocal effects of spatial struc-
ture on system dynamics, and of processes in time on spatial structure. This reciprocal
dependence can be most obvious in graphs which include both space and time (see
Chapter 10), but there are many examples where the spatial context is the ﬁrst prior-
ity (think of the phrase that events “take place”). This is especially true for ecological
processes related to habitat fragmentation, environmental degradation, land use, climate
change and the threat of extinction. In such situations, spatial graphs and the theory that
goes with them provide the tools to present, characterize, analyze, test and model spatial
systems of ecological interest. This is true, also, of the ecological interactions of pre-
dation, facilitation, competition, mutualism, parasitism and so on, that occur in space
as well as in time. There are, therefore, many possible applications of spatial graphs in
ecological studies (Fall et al. 2007; Dale & Fortin 2010), but the emphasis will be on
their use to portray habitat patches in a landscape (nodes) with connections or disper-
sal between them (edges), with implications for metapopulation and metacommunity
structure related to diversity and conservation (Urban & Keitt 2001; Urban et al. 2009).
Spatial graphs are deﬁned by having nodes with spatial locations, usually given by
coordinates in one, two or three dimensions. This small modiﬁcation to aspatial graphs
has profound effects on how these graphs are used and interpreted. There may be greater
intuitive appeal because the graph is now like a familiar map of point events determined
by spatial processes or of objects in a landscape, rather than structure in the abstract,
but now there are the complications of the constraints of space.
The ﬁrst set of questions for any spatial graph is about the locations of the nodes:
where are they, what are their relative positions, and what processes determine them?
This leads into the realm of spatial analysis and spatial point processes, with the nodes
being identiﬁed with the dimensionless events of a spatial point pattern (Figure 9.1;
see Dale & Fortin 2014; Illian et al. 2008, among many others). Questions about loca-
tions do not usually apply to the edges; any edge has its end-point positions ﬁxed by
the nodes it joins, but the line depicting an edge may not reﬂect a real trajectory or

physical structure. With some exceptions, such as a corridor or bridge that has physi-
cal extent, the length of any edge is deﬁned by the distance between the two nodes it
joins.
The second set of questions is about edges, concerning which pairs of nodes are
joined by edges and the process or rule that determines them. This may be about deﬁn-
ing “neighbours” in a spatial context, about which much is already known (Dale &
Fortin 2014, Chapter 3) and which will be summarized below. The questions become
more complicated when the edges are determined by something other than just proxim-
ity: processes such as transport, or spatial objects such as rivers and streams or corridors
of hedgerows and cut-lines. It may also be complicated when the edges have clear direc-
tionality.
There are many smart things to be done with spatial graphs and the related theory, but
the focus will be examples related to diversity and conservation such as how spatially
determined processes can affect population and community properties. Much research
in landscape ecology begins with patches of habitat and the connections between them,
and their effects on organisms; this seems like an ideal system to explore the use of
spatial graphs.
Studies that take advantage of spatial graphs will include some of the following:
r Find distinguishing characteristics of the system and its spatial structure.
r Determine key features of the graph for the characteristic of interest, especially those
related to connectivity, however deﬁned.
r Use a hierarchy of edge rules and compare the changes in graph characteristics
through the hierarchy as edge density and edge length varies, OR compare the results
of such topologically deﬁned edges with functionally determined edges when this is
possible.

9.1
Properties of Spatial Graphs
9.1.1
Connectivity
In ecological studies, several key properties of spatial graphs for analysis and modelling
are related to connectivity. The ﬁrst property is whether the graph is connected, which
means there is a path from any node to any other (Figure 9.2a). Then, measures of
connectivity evaluate the strength or robustness of the connectedness. If the only path
between two nodes contains a cut-node or a cut-edge, the path is vulnerable to discon-
nection, and the connectedness is not very strong (Rayﬁeld et al. 2011). The connectivity
of a pair of nodes can be measured by the number of independent paths between them
(i.e. sharing no nodes and no edges; Newman 2010) (see Figure 9.2a). The concept can
be reﬁned by distinguishing between the number of paths sharing no nodes, giving node
connectivity, and the number of paths sharing no edges, giving edge-connectivity. It can
also be modiﬁed to assess the graph’s vulnerability to the removal of two or more nodes
that will disconnect the graph, a node cut-set of size 2, 3, 4, . . . ; or to the removal of two
or more edges, an edge cut-set of size 2, 3, 4, . . . , as shown in Figure 9.2b. Connectivity
increases with the size of the minimum cut sets, those that will disconnect the graph
with the loss of the fewest nodes or edges. Connectivity, as a reﬁnement of “connected
or not,” can be extended and adapted to situations where the edges have weights indicat-
ing capacity, and while the term is often used informally or imprecisely, it has intuitive
appeal (see McRae et al 2008; Minor & Urban 2008; Saura et al. 2014).
9.1.2
Locations, Distances, Proximity
The characteristics of spatial graphs for ecological applications include properties
described for aspatial graphs, such as paths and path length, connectedness and compo-
nents, centrality measures, motifs and so on, but the deﬁning characteristics of spatial
graphs are node locations and edge inclusion rules.
There are n nodes and thus potentially n(n −1)/2 edges between them (if all are
occupied, it is a complete graph). The nodes have spatial positions, and so there are
measured distances between nodes based on those positions in the reference space, usu-
ally Euclidean space. Those distances, and circles of sizes determined by inter-node
distances, have an important role in deﬁning which pairs of nodes are joined according
to a hierarchy of “topological” neighbour rules. Table 9.1 summarizes that hierarchy
of neighbour-rule graphs; in which the edges in each one are a subset of those in the
succeeding, more highly connected, networks. For any of these “topological” rules for
graph construction, the result is a network of the nodes that are (somehow) neighbours,

and may be referred to as “proximity graphs” (see Cardinal et al. 2009). Sparse graphs
are formed when each node is joined to the node nearest to it (nearest neighbour rule)
or the join is made only if the relationship is reciprocal (mutually nearest neighbours).
The Minimum Spanning Tree is a tree that connects all nodes using the smallest possi-
ble total length of edges. More edges result if nodes A and B are joined if and only if
the intersection of circles centred on A and B with radius AB contains no other nodes
(relative neighbourhood graph rule; Toussaint 1980). If the rule is that nodes A and B
are joined if and only if the circle on diameter AB is empty yields the Gabriel graph
with average degree about 4.0. The last one, the Delaunay triangulation, is found in
many applications. It can be created by the rule that the three edges of any triangle of
nodes are all included if and only if the circumcircle of the triangle contains no other
nodes. The resulting structure is directly related to a partitioning of the plane into poly-
gons, one for each node, being the portion of the plane closer to its own node than to
any other. There are many applications of these polygons (called Dirichlet domains or
Voronoi or Theissen polygons) in spatial analysis in two or more dimensions (see Okabe
et al. 2000).
Several of these neighbour networks in Table 9.1 are members of other well-deﬁned
hierarchies of networks. An obvious example is the graph with edges joining each node
to its closest neighbour (entry 2 in Table 9.1 nearest neighbours); this is easily extended
to more highly connected graphs with edges joining each node to its ﬁrst nearest neigh-
bour and to its second nearest neighbour; then ﬁrst, second and third nearest neighbours;
and so on. This sequence also has the property of edges as subsets of those in any of
the more highly connected graphs. Less obviously, the Gabriel graph is a member of
another sequence of edge rules; in it, nodes A and B are joined if and only if the cir-
cle on diameter AB contains no other nodes. The larger series of rules is called the
β-skeleton series, based on the criterion of no other nodes within an area deﬁned by
not just one, but two circles passing through the two focal nodes (for details, see Kirk-
patrick & Radke 1985). The Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) occurs in another series
that includes the minimum planar graph, which has also been used in ecological studies
(James et al. 2005; Fall et al. 2007); it converts each landscape patch into several nodes,
not just one, to accommodate perimeter-to-perimeter links rather than centre-to-centre
and minimizes the total length of edges used in this way. Most of these rules for the
inclusion of neighbour edges can be typiﬁed as “empty region graphs” and Cardinal
et al. (2009) have provided an appealing summary of this broad family of neighbour
networks, illustrating the intellectual and aesthetic appeal of graph theory.
In addition to the “topological” rules for edges, another easy choice is using distance
thresholds that reﬂect species’ potential dispersal ability; all pairs of nodes closer than
threshold distance T are joined by an edge. Several values of T produce a hierarchy
of graphs with nested edge sets moving up or down the hierarchy. A variation is to
have an upper and lower threshold so that the edge lengths fall only within a speciﬁed
range. The upper distance threshold approach has simplicity to recommend it; but one
drawback is that a small threshold value can produce nodes with no neighbours, and
thus difﬁcult to include in any analysis, as well as nodes with many neighbours (consider
the lower left vs the upper right in Figure 9.1). With more edges at a single node, each
additional edge may contribute little or less new information to the analysis. Topological

rules have the advantage of a more equitable inclusion of nodes, near or far. The other
feature of distance threshold rules is that small changes in the threshold can create large
changes in the graphs’ characteristics, particularly connectedness features such as cut-
points and cut-edges (see Figure 9.3). Dale and Fortin (2014) have provided a detailed
example using the locations of lakes in a peatland on the Alberta-Saskatchewan border
(their Figure 3.22). In that example, a small change in the distance threshold, from 5
km to 4 km, makes dramatic changes to the connectedness and other characteristics
of the graph, such as three components becoming nine components. Often, the choice
of threshold distance will have sound ecological reasons. For example, in a study of
landscape connectivity for conservation purposes, Minor and Urban (2008) joined pairs
of landscape patch nodes where they were separated by 1500 m or less, based on the
typical dispersal distance for a small songbird.
It is really (really!) important to understand that the edges in these spatial structure
graphs based on the positions of nodes are not data. They are imposed by the positions
of the nodes and the rule chosen, whether as a somewhat arbitrary decision or by design
to test speciﬁc hypotheses. This means that for the most basic graphs, there is nothing
to be learned from randomizations or some of the other techniques we often used to
evaluate structure, unless it is the positions of the nodes that are randomized. As soon as
there are labels on the nodes or edges, or weights on either, of course, these approaches
make sense again.
A smart thing to do with these graphs is to compare the topological rule edges with
edges based on function or underlying processes. It may not be easy to determine func-
tional edges for a spatial graph, but it can be worth the effort. For example, different
models of the cost or resistance to movement in a network, and known genetic structure
or community similarities can be used to evaluate adjacency (neighbour) networks (see
e.g. McRae et al. 2008; Gilarranz et al. 2015). While the explanatory power for ecolog-
ical characteristics, such as species composition, from the nearest neighbour structure
of an archipelago may be weak because there are so many factors other than proximity

(wind, currents, shoreline, elevation, habitat, . . . ), that of the spatial graph of a river sys-
tem may be stronger. Stream order and proximity along a watercourse should provide
good predictions of similarity of species composition from site to site in an appropri-
ately constructed spatial graph (see Fagan 2002; Grant et al. 2007; Schick & Lindley
2007; Labonne et al. 2008; Peterson et al. 2013; Erös et al. 2012).
There is a gradation of the apparent reliability of the functional edges of a spatial
graph and any claims we might want to make of them. The gradation goes from direct
observations to convincing deductions, and then to more speculative explanations (e.g.
radio-collared animals with positions recorded frequently compared to storm tracks and
prevailing winds). The more “iffy” and less convincing the evidence for edges of func-
tion, the better it is to rely more on topological or distance rules for the edges of the
graph, and the less justiﬁable the claims for a single “best” path from one habitat patch
to another. I think this fact provides a strong argument for considering an approach that
uses all possible paths, however weighted, to produce a summary of all routes that might
occur; this is the “sum-of-all-paths” method.
9.1.3
Point Pattern Analysis: Clusters, Holes, Modularity, Scale
Given the locations of the nodes, an obvious step is to evaluate any non-randomness,
such as clusters of nodes. The simple version is to test whether the positions are con-
sistent with clustering, randomness or overdispersion. That trichotomy is too simplis-
tic because the same pattern can be both clustered and overdispersed, but at different
scales (see Dale & Fortin 2014, Figure 4.1). In addition to looking for clusters of nodes,
it may be of ecological interest to examine the data for signiﬁcant holes (see Figure
9.4). In graph theory, the term “modularity” refers to the divisibility of the graph into
.010
15:27:40

198
9 Spatial Graphs
subgraphs that are internally highly connected, but with few edges between them. A
ﬁrst step, then, is to assess the spatial pattern of the nodes (clusters, holes; apparently
random; overdispersion), and the spatial scales of any non-randomness.
The extensive literature of point pattern analysis provides many choices for the detec-
tion and characterization of clusters. In general, the analysis of point patterns is based
on distances: distances to the ﬁrst (closest) neighbours; distances from any point (node)
to its kth nearest neighbour (k = 1, 2, 3, . . . ); the numbers of other nodes within distance
t of any node (Ripley’s K function); the numbers of other nodes between distance t and t
+ δt of any node (Condit’s  function); and so on (see Dale & Fortin, 2014, Chapter 4;
Illian et al. 2008, among many others). The graph theory equivalent is the detection of
“modularity,” which is the divisibility of a graph into highly connected subgraphs with
few edges between them. This may reﬂect the community substructure of any spatial
graph, and Newman (2006) provided an algorithm for dividing a univariate graph into
such subgraphs based on the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the graph.
The complementary task is the detection of “holes” in the point pattern of nodes
(Figure 9.4). There are several approaches possible including scan statistics, where a
moving template (such as a circle taking a range of diameters) scans over the entire ﬁeld
of the pattern and registers the sizes and locations of areas with strikingly low density
(cold spots) or strikingly high density (hot spots) (see Glaz et al. 2001). An alternative to
the sliding circle template is to use only circles that are determined pass through triplets
of the nodes themselves, the “circumcircles” of the triangles of nodes. Comparison of
the observed counts of nodes in any circle with the expected number identiﬁes hot spots
and cold spots in the spatial pattern (see Dale & Fortin 2014, Chapter 4). Criteria to
narrow the list of cold spots can lead to the identiﬁcation of holes in the spatial scatter
of nodes.
The nodes of a spatial graph can be identiﬁed with the point events of spatial pattern
analysis, and analyzed by those methods. The relationship between methods of spatial
analysis and edge creation rules for spatial graphs is very close, and any one of the
standard methods for point pattern analysis can be directly related to one of the spatial
graph edge rules, with the graph nodes being the point events that are the subject of the
analysis (see Dale & Fortin 2014, Tables 4.2 and 5.1).
Where the edges in a spatial graph have meaning beyond neighbour structure, we
may also seek methods that will detect clusters (or “holes”) in the pattern of edges
(see Figure 9.5). The method chosen will depend on whether the edges represent spa-
tial relationships, functional interactions or physical trajectories or structures. Methods
include determining the node degree spatial distribution; conversion to a line graph
(edges become nodes; see Chapter 1); analyzing the edges themselves as patterns of lin-
ear objects, “ﬁbres” (ﬁbre pattern analysis, see Stoyan et al. 1995; Dale & Fortin 2014,
Chapter 3.2); and more to be discovered or developed.
9.1.4
Distance, Path Length, Centrality
Important concepts for these spatial graphs are those of paths, path lengths and dis-
tances. As usual, the paths are sequences of nodes and the edges with no elements

repeated, and it is possible for a path of fewer links to be longer in its spatial span from
ﬁrst node to last than a path of more links. The features of distances in spatial graphs
were described in Chapter 1, and can be summarized as:
r The graph theory distance between nodes, δ(u,v), is the minimum sum of weights on
edges for any path from u and to v.
r In aspatial graphs, that is the minimum number of edges in such a path (geodesic
distance) because all the weights are 1. This leads to the following:
b The diameter of the graph is the greatest (geodesic) distance between two nodes,
which is also the maximum shortest paths between pairs.
b The characteristic path length is the average of the geodesic distances between all
pairs of nodes, which is also the average of the shortest paths between pairs.
b The eccentricity of a node is its greatest distance to any other. The graph diameter
is therefore the maximum eccentricity of any node.
b The radius is the minimum eccentricity of any node.
r In a spatial graph, edge euv has its own spatial length, d(u,v) or ds(u,v) = l(euv), and
so δ(u,v) is the sum of such lengths for the shortest path between u and v.
r There are two kinds of distance between nodes: the simple spatial distance duv
between their locations, and δ(u,v) = the sum of the spatial lengths of the edges in
the shortest path, dp(u,v). (Figure 1.10 illustrates these differences.)
A related concept is graph size, usually the characteristic path length, which is the aver-
age distance of all node pairs. Because the distance between nodes with no paths is

Table 9.2 Centrality Measures for Nodes in Spatial Graphs
Betweenness centrality
The betweenness centrality of node v is the proportion of the shortest
paths between any pair of nodes in G that pass through node v.
Closeness centrality
Closeness centrality in spatial graphs measures the average physical
distance from node v to all other nodes; nodes with shorter
distances have greater centrality.
Eigenvector (spectral)
centrality
Includes all possible paths in its measure, not just the shortest paths,
but weighting each path by a factor based on its length, λ.
Geographic centrality
For a spatial graph, the betweenness and closeness centralities can be
based on geographic distance instead of geodesic distance: d(u,v)
instead of δ(u,v). A simple weighting of a node’s geographic
centrality in a spatial graph is its distance from the centre of
gravity of all N nodes, γ , giving an index between 0 and 1:
cg(v) =
d(v, γ )
maxu[d(u, γ )].
(9.1)
This measure can also be used as a weighting to modify existing
measures of centrality into a more spatially responsive form. It can
also be the basis for weighting measures of edge centrality, rather
than the node centrality presented in this table.
Note: See Table 3.1 and Figures 3.8a–3.8e.
inﬁnite, it may be preferable to use the average of the distances’ inverses, dij−1 so that
pairs of nodes with no path contribute zero to the average. Node centrality measures a
node’s importance as a component of the graph’s shortest paths; there are many versions,
as illustrated in Table 9.2.
Centrality measures can be based on any quantitative characteristic of paths, not only
those included here. For example, Hock and Mumby (2015) described a measure of
the reliability of dispersal paths in connectivity networks, based on the probability that
a patch has a “direct effect” on a given neighbour. It is then reasonable to create an
index of a node’s reliability path centrality: the proportion of all highest reliability paths
between any pair of nodes in the network that pass through the focal node. No doubt,
other centrality measures can be developed for particular purposes as the need arises.
9.1.5
Connected Components; Cut-Nodes and Cut-Edges
A connected component is a subgraph with at least one path between any pair of nodes.
In a spatial digraph (with directed edges), there are several kinds of connected compo-
nents for any node v: the out-component of v is the set of all nodes, u, for which there is a
directed path from v to u; the in-component of v is the set of all nodes, u, for which there
is a directed path from u to v (Nicosia et al. 2012). A strongly connected component has
directed paths in both directions between any pair of nodes within it, although the paths
do not need to be through the same nodes. The connected components of a spatial graph
deﬁne the subsets of nodes among which movement is possible; and that should be the
justiﬁcation for how the edges are determined. Ecologically, not mathematically, it may
be possible to have dispersal between parts of a graph that do not seem connected, even
.010
15:27:40

9.2 Techniques for Spatial Graphs: Testing Signiﬁcance and Other Assessments
201
if the probability is low (think of “tunnelling”). On the other hand, dispersal within a
connected component of a spatial graph may be rare or vulnerable if it requires paths
through cut-nodes or cut-edges, which may represent bottlenecks for movement. Real
systems described by spatial graphs tend to have temporal characteristics as well, and so
the capacity of nodes or edges may vary through time, or they may actually be intermit-
tent in function. All these variations have implications when the spatial graph refers to a
landscape of habitat patches with local extinction by patch and recolonization between
patches based on dispersal.
9.1.6
Autocorrelation
Spatial autocorrelation is a key feature of many graphs or networks; it can be posi-
tive or negative and often changes sign as well as magnitude with distance. Abundant
short-range dispersal can result in positive autocorrelation of population or community
properties at short distances, where different environmental conditions produce nega-
tive autocorrelation at greater distances. A similar property is homophily or the positive
assortativeness of neighbour nodes; for spatial graphs this can include the proximity in
space of the nodes’ edges, as well as similarity in other characteristics such as aggre-
gate degree. The opposite is heterophily, indicating dissimilarity of nodes’ character-
istics, usually when they are close together. For many ecological applications, the way
that similarity and dissimilarity change both with physical distance and with the var-
ious kinds of connections between sites (nodes) is a key feature to understanding the
phenomenon and the processes associated with it.
9.1.7
Planarity
A property of interest for spatial graphs is planarity, which simply means that it can be
drawn in the plane without any edges intersecting (Harary 1969). Remember that the
edges don’t have to be straight! For a graph that is not planar, there are several measures
of how close to or far from planar it is. The thickness of graph G is the minimum number
of planar subgraphs the union of which form G. If the graph is planar, thickness = 1.
The crossing number is the minimum number of pairwise intersections of edges when
the graph is drawn in the plane. A planar graph has crossing number = 0. Planarity is
a quite intuitive concept of non-crossing edges when drawn in the plane, but is clearly
of interest when the edges represent dispersal routes between habitat patches or similar
spatial structures in a landscape.
9.2
Techniques for Spatial Graphs: Testing Signiﬁcance
and Other Assessments
9.2.1
Random Assignment and Restricted Randomizations
The simplest signiﬁcance test for many graph properties is by restricted randomiza-
tion for the characteristic of interest, based either on the whole graph or on sub-areas
.010
15:27:40

202
9 Spatial Graphs
or on individual nodes. The characteristics include centrality measures for nodes or
for edges, local indices of persistence or autocorrelation (local by node, edge or sub-
area), or topological properties such as connectivity or connectedness. The combination
of frequency enumeration with the comparison of observed and expected values can
also be used, but the restricted randomization approach has much to recommend it.
One key technique for this analysis, and one of the strengths of this approach, is to
employ more than one randomization procedure (e.g. random edges, randomized edges
restricted by number, randomizing edge weights among edges retained in position, . . . ).
It is an easy step to go from restricted randomization to modelling that includes the
same restrictions in the generation of artiﬁcial “data” for comparison with the observed
results.
9.2.2
Comparison with Models
Although not testing statistical signiﬁcance, the comparison of graph-theoretical prop-
erties with characteristics from other modelling exercises is often used to assess the
chosen approach. Spatially explicit population models are often cited as the best way
to understand species’ distributions in patchy landscapes, but they can be demand-
ing to implement computationally and in the ecological detail required. Minor and
Urban (2007) compared spatially explicit modelling for the wood thrush (Hylocichla
mustelina) in patchy habitat with graph-theoretical analysis that included node degree,
betweenness centrality, inﬂux and outﬂux measures and a quality-weighted area mea-
sure for the nodes. They found that the graph theory approach was good at identifying
“stepping-stones” in the spatial structure, and its predictions were similar to those of the
explicit modelling procedure (Minor & Urban 2007; see also Saura et al. 2014; Rubio
et al. 2015).

Diversity and Nestedness
The introductory comments for this chapter promised to describe how spatial graphs
can be applied to understanding how biological diversity is organized in space, particu-
larly for real or virtual archipelagos of habitat. The ﬁrst implication of such a physical
structure is that there is a natural hierarchy to the organization of diversity in space,
for example: diversity among samples within a site on an island; diversity among sites
within an island; diversity among islands within the archipelago. Other levels of the
same hierarchy are possible, for example if there are island chains or sub-groupings
within the archipelago. Of course, the diversity of islands can be partitioned and ana-
lyzed differently: by island size, island topographical relief, island distance (to neigh-
bours, to a mainland, . . . ), or island age and history if known. The spatial context for
island comes into play when their species compositions and diversities are to be corre-
lated with spatial proximity and network connectivity.

One characteristic frequently cited in studies of insular communities is nestedness,

asymmetry in the assortativeness of nodes’ degrees. In nested data, rare species occur
only at the richest sites and species-poor sites have only the most common species
(Figure 9.6). Nestedness can also be found in a functional version for two sets of mutu-
alists such as ﬂowering plants and their pollinator insects (see Bascompte & Jordano
2014, Chapter 3) (see also Chapter 7 of this volume). Nestedness in a bipartite graph
has nodes of low degree adjacent only to high degree nodes, but high degree nodes
joined to nodes with degrees from low to high (Figures 9.6). The degree distribution
associated with nestedness is not distinctive, but may be confounded with characteris-
tics associated with different models of network development (e.g. random vs scale free;
see Chapter 1).
Nestedness is not itself spatial, but it can be mapped onto the spatial arrangement of
the sites, and each site has a nestedness score based on its compositional concordance
with all taxa and all sites (see Dale & Fortin 2014, Box 10.1). Those scores then have
a spatial structure, which can be visualized as a spatial graph. In addition, each pair of
sites has a relative nestedness score, measuring the nesting of their compositions (see
Dale & Fortin 2014, Box 10.2), and again these values can be mapped to the pairs of
sites, or to the edges that join them. Because the original nestedness graph is bipar-
tite, one set of nodes (the sites) can be constrained to be spatial, and the other nodes
(the species) remain non-spatial (Figure 9.7). Spatial neighbours can be determined by
any rule (e.g. Delaunay triangulation, Figure 9.7). The original bipartite graph can have
edges among the species added to depict any one of many aspatial associations: phytoso-
ciological structure, taxonomic relatedness or shared membership in functional groups.

can be added to or labelled in the spatial part of the graph, based on one of many criteria
and a threshold value for inclusion:
1 Compositional similarity of the communities, measured by any similarity index
(many choices, see Legendre & Legendre 2012) or the number of species shared
or the level of dendrogram join in a cluster analysis.
2 Similarity of an index of species diversity or of species richness at the sites.
3 Similarity of the site nestedness scores, indicating comparable positions in the nest-
edness structure.
4 A measure of mutual relative nestedness of the two species complements at the two
sites, or a directed edge from the richer site to the poorer indicating the relationship
of complete nesting.
5 Physical proximity or ease of dispersal between sites.
6 Similarities in other important site characteristics: island area, range of habitats, geo-
logical history, topographic proﬁle and so on.
These characteristics are mainly independent, although not fully so, and combinations
can be considered, such as physical proximity weighted by habitat matching, or compo-
sitional similarity combined with a high degree of mutual nestedness (this may deter-
mine the choice of index).
In addition, two different criteria for edges in a spatial graph can be created and then
compared, such as (a) the most favourable dispersal routes between sites and (b) the sim-
ilarities of species complements of pairs of sites. Clearly, there are insights to be gained
from such comparisons. Applying different criteria for placing edges in nestedness
graphs allows the evaluation of several hypotheses on species’ spatial distributions, such
as differential extinction versus differential colonization as explanatory mechanisms

(Darlington 1957; Lomolino 2006). Again, the graph itself is just a skeleton on which
the analysis is based; the edges are created by topological or distance rules, and there-
fore do not really represent data to be studied further.
Two studies of species composition using spatial graphs were discussed in Dale and
Fortin (2014, Section 10.3.3.2, Figures 10.15 and 10.16). The ﬁrst concerns forest bird
species on recently isolated islands in Lago Guri in Venezuela (Feeley et al. 2007),
and the second is the biogeography of Tenebrionid beetles on long-existing islands in
the Aegean Sea (Fattorini & Fowles 2005; Fattorini 2007). Spatial analysis looked at
the autocorrelation of species richness and site nestedness scores based on neighbours
deﬁned by the Minimum Spanning Tree rules for edge deﬁnition in a spatial graph. The
Aegean Sea example can be used as a basis for illustrating some of the features of the
further graph theory approach to analysis.
The Tenebrionid beetles data included 165 species on 32 islands, but Crete and
Euboea were omitted due to their large size, leaving 160 species and 30 islands. Figure
9.8a shows the spatial graph of the sites with edges determined as a Minimum Spanning
Tree. The nodes are coded by their global nestedness score, and the edges were evalu-
ated for the relative nestedness of the pairs they join. The basic spatial and correlational
analysis used island location, size and species list to give richness, diversity, and nest-
edness scores for sites, and relative nestedness scores for pairs of sites. The kinds of
questions to be asked included:
Is richness correlated with island size?
What is the autocorrelation of island size among adjacent sites in the graph?
What is the autocorrelation of richness for adjacent (MST) sites?
Are the site nestedness scores spatially clustered or intermingled?
What is the autocorrelation of nestedness scores for adjacent sites?
What is the spatial pattern of the relative nestedness scores of the edges?
. . . and so on.
For the beetles in the Aegean, nestedness was found to be high and clustered in the
smaller islands in the south-central area with a trend to lower nestedness on the periph-
ery; the relative nestedness of MST neighbours was generally low, negative in fact,
except for the three indicated.
To go beyond this spatial analysis, graph theory concepts can now be included; and
it is useful to compare results from the MST neighbour graph with the results from a
skeleton with more edges and here the Gabriel graph was chosen (Figure 9.8b).
A revised set of questions could be considered, based on the same data, for example:
Is richness correlated with island centrality?
Which measure of node connectivity best predicts species richness?
Which measure of node connectivity best predicts site nestedness?
What neighbour deﬁnition gives the highest autocorrelation of neighbouring island
sizes?
Are clusters of most similar nodes distance or topologically deﬁned?
. . . and so on.

To illustrate, island composition similarity levels (1 to 12), based on the dendrogram of
the Dollo parsimony consensus tree given by Fattorini and Fowles (2005), are mapped
onto both examples of spatial graphs, MST and Gabriel graph, shown in Figure 9.9a and
9.9b). (The dendrogram itself could be imposed on the spatial graph as in Figure 9.7,
but it becomes too complicated to be helpful.) Not only does the proportion of edges
increase, but it can cause radical shifts in the apparent roles of particular nodes. For
example node 17 in the Aegean (the island of Mikonos) is of relatively low centrality
in the MST spatial graph, but it becomes highly central in more than one measure in
the Gabriel graph (centrality measures not shown in these ﬁgures). In fact, moving up
the series of topological graphs with connectivity increasing produces two results: (1)
many measures of centrality will converge as nodes that are physically or geographically
central achieve higher values of betweenness or closeness centrality; and (2) degree cen-
trality becomes uninformative as nodes’ degrees become more uniform, moving toward
the average value of 6, as expected in the Delaunay triangulation.
Mapping the compositional similarity results onto the spatial graph also allows the
difference between the two neighbour graphs to be clariﬁed. Despite some obvious
groupings of neighbouring islands, many adjacent pairs end up with negative relative
nestedness scores just because their species compositions are so different, being joined
in the Dollo parsimony consensus tree (dendrogram) only at the eighth or ninth (or
eleventh) level of joins. Other clustering procedures give different results, of course, but
those dissimilarities must be strong to be so obvious in this algorithm.
The difference between analysis from graph theory and other forms of spatial anal-
ysis is an interesting one, but the role of structural characteristics of graphs for spatial
analysis are illustrated by comparing the MST analysis with Gabriel graph versions for
the same data (Figures 9.8 and 9.9). Not all the questions in the list are answered in this
discussion, but it should provide some guidance on how to proceed in analyzing spatial
data using spatial graphs.
9.3.2
Landscape Patches, Connectivity, Random Walks and Conservation Biology
Along with diversity and nestedness, spatial graphs can be applied to other aspects of
conservation ecology in fragmented landscapes, using the analogy of patches as islands.
In a network of landscape patches, the patches are the nodes and the edges represent dis-
persal routes, whether physical like ditches or functional like ﬂyways or merely notional
as assumed links. Spatial graphs can quantify the effects eliminating particular elements
by modelling the loss of habitat patches or of dispersal corridors (Urban & Keitt 2001).
Connectivity is the key feature, and much research has examined measures of landscape
connectivity and their ability to predict observed outcomes related to dispersal and con-
servation (see Pascual-Hortal & Saura 2006; Baranyi et al. 2011). Laita et al. (2011)
expressed concern that many connectivity measures may react to landscape characteris-
tics (e.g. patch size vs patch location) in ways that are undesirable for evaluating reserve
networks; suggesting there is more work to be done to ensure the correct inferences are
derived from graph theory for conservation applications.

Keitt et al. (1997) showed how graph theory can characterize connectivity using land-
scape metrics, such as patch importance, which are computed for different distance
thresholds derived from the species’ dispersal abilities. Many researchers have used this
approach (e.g. Ricotta et al. 2000; O’Brien et al. 2006; Urban et al. 2009) with different
edge rules, whether the Minimum Spanning Tree (Urban & Keitt 2001) or the Delau-
nay triangulation (Fall et al. 2007; Andersson & Bodin 2009). For the landscape and
the organisms of interest, the important graph theory features are related to ecological
connectivity, with implications for spatial integration from the ease and frequency of
dispersal, as well as vulnerability versus resilience. The graph theory properties include
connectivity (as a formal graph-theoretical measure), connected components, modu-
larity, cut-points and cut-edges, centrality, path lengths, and so on (Fall et al. 2007;
Ferrari et al. 2007). The use of two senses of “connectivity” may be confusing; but it
reﬂects actual use in the landscape and conservation literature (see Laita et al. 2011),
in which a number of graph-theoretic indices have been proposed and applied for that
purpose. This approach has been criticized because of the reliance on habitat quality
deﬁnitions and thresholds, because it reﬂects only the emigration-immigration aspects
of dynamics, and because it does not work well for large-scale, high-resolution grid data
on species distributions in heterogeneous habitats (Moilanen 2011). Despite these stated
limitations, the measures can quantify some aspects of landscape spatial structure with
a range of indices.
9.3.3
A Long Detour: Random Walks on Graphs
I think that the background of using graphs for patchy landscapes includes not just
intuitive ideas about movement and dispersal between patches as a stochastic process
(Hock & Mumby 2015), but also ideas captured by the more formal concept of random
walks from mathematics (e.g. Economo & Keitt 2008). A random walk is a series of
random steps, whether in a spatial context or more abstract, but the idea and its formal
treatment have applications in physics, economics, chemistry, ﬁnance, computer science
and so on. Ecologists are most familiar with the random walk model of movement and
diffusion in space (Codling et al. 2008) and the correlated random walk which provides
more realistic trajectories for animal movement (see Fagan & Calabrese 2014), but a
random walk on a graph is different because the walk is constrained to the nodes and
edges of its graph. If the landscape is pictured as a spatially organized set of nodes,
with the only routes for movement between them being the edges of the graph, it is easy
to imagine dispersal processes as the unintentional movement of individual organisms
between nodes along any of the edges available. This picture is very similar to a random
walk on that landscape graph.
A random walk is created by starting at a chosen node and moving to a randomly
chosen neighbour with a given probability, and then this process is repeated (simple!),
as illustrated in Figure 9.10. In a walk on a graph, elements can be re-used. Obviously,
if a graph is not connected, no single random walk can reach all parts of the graph,
and so random walks provide information about graph connectivity and other structural
properties. This is an area of graph theory that has been very well researched, from the

beginning, and there is much information available; Lovász (1993) has provided a good
summary.
There are important differences between walks on directed and on non-directed
graphs, but here we will focus the latter. The basic properties of random walks are
determined by the spectrum of the graph (giving us spectral graph theory; see Chung
1997), which is the set of eigenvalues of the graph’s adjacency or Laplacian matrix (see
Chapter 1). Characteristics of the spectrum can be used to evaluate connectivity; for
example, the difference between the ﬁrst and second eigenvalues is called the spectral
gap, and it can be a measure of the graphs vulnerability to disconnection, with higher
values indicating less vulnerability (Figure 9.11; see Donetti et al. 2006). The walk’s
properties can also be seen through the electrical resistance of the electrical network
associated with the graph, for example, where each edge represents a unit of resistance
and current enters the graph at one node and leaves at another (Lovász 1993); hence the
relationship between spatial graphs in ecology and circuit theory (see McRae & Beier
2007).
The simplest random walk begins at an arbitrarily chosen node, v0, and at each iter-
ation, or time unit, the walk moves from vt to any of the node’s neighbours, vt+1, with
equal probability, so the probability for any neighbour is 1/d(vt). As iteration continues,
the frequency of being at any particular node converges to a stationary value; for node
i, the long-term frequency (or probability) is proportional to its degree: pi = di/ Ʃdi.
This means that the higher a node’s degree, the more probable it is to be “occupied” by
a random walk, such as a randomly dispersing animal. The result is higher densities are
to be predicted at nodes with higher degrees. This provides a simple explanation of why
degree can be a measure of connectivity for conservation in a fragmented landscape.

Based on Donetti et al. (2006). Spectral gap increases from 0.38 to 5.05.
Each iteration can be treated as a time unit with one “step” in each, but for ecological
applications, random walks are not expected to occur that way in real time units; they are
more notional or conceptual. However, the expected number of steps or notional time
units of iteration to reach a circle of radius r from the starting node is r2, so that distance
can be equated with the square root of time; expressed for a physical system, Brownian
motion takes time t to get to distance t (Lovász 1993). Other properties of interest
may be the access time, the number steps required to reach node j, starting at node i; the
cover time, the number of iterations required to reach all nodes; and the mixing rate, a
measure of how quickly the walk converges to the limiting distribution (Lovász 1993).
Among the results that are directly applicable to landscape and conservation ecology
include the facts that:
1 The access time from i to j may be different from the access time for j to i (even in a
regular graph, where each node has the same degree, not shown). In Figure 9.12, the
access time from A to B is much shorter than from B to A, because a random walk
starting at A must move initially in the direction of B; from B a random walk can
proceed in any of six directions with equal probability, thus starting toward A with
probability 1/6.
2 Contrary to intuition, access time does not always increase with the distance between
the nodes (Figure 9.12). The access time from A to X, three steps removed, is much
less than the access time from X to Y (or Y to X), a shorter distance of two steps. The
random walk between X and Y passes through B and therefore has a high probability
of diverting to another branch of the graph.
3 Surprisingly (perhaps), adding an edge to a given graph does not necessarily decrease
properties related to recolonization such as access time or cover time, but may actually
increase them! (Lovász 1993) (Figure 9.13). In Figure 9.13, the addition of edges DG

and EH to the original graph greatly decreases the probability that a random walk will
reach node F, thereby greatly increasing the time expected for the walk to reach all
nodes at least once (cover time).
Such counter-intuitive results emphasize the importance of understanding the implica-
tions of this approach. The results also tell us that:
4 In landscape and conservation applications, the determination of which edges are
included in a real or conceptual spatial graph of the system is critical to the predic-
tions we can make about its dynamics. (Yes, we knew this already, really, but the
implications of points 2 and 3 above are especially important in this context.)
For ecological applications, there is one more crucial ﬁnding (Alon et al. 2011):

Running several independent random walks, perhaps even starting from the same node
and not from random nodes, can speed up the cover time in number of steps (the
expected time for all nodes to be included at least once) for many “interesting” graphs
(Alon et al. 2011). In Figure 9.12, a single random walk can get trapped in one of the
arms; more starting nodes increase the probability that each arm is covered relatively
quickly, without having to pass twice through the bottleneck at node B. Even a random
walk starting at B will have difﬁculty covering the entire graph, and it is easy to see that
having many walks will cover the whole graph faster. The implications are that more
dispersers from a single source or dispersal from several source patches can decrease
the total time to covering sites of recent local extinction, particularly in a complex spa-
tial structure. This is one example where adding edges could greatly reduce (rather than
increase) cover time, if the edges were bridges between the arms.
The simplest random walk model provides some helpful insights, but clearly it may
not be the best model in every situation. Where wind or water currents produce a direc-
tional bias, random walks on digraphs will be a better approximation, but these are not
as well behaved as the non-directional versions. For example, there is the difﬁcult ques-
tion of how to deal with nodes that have 0 in-degree, or nodes with 0 out-degree; one
solution is to use randomly chosen nodes to restart the random walk at a randomly cho-
sen node at designated intervals. (This may seem biologically unreasonable, but think of
the upstream re-establishment of water plants by transport by waterfowl.) Furthermore,
the adjacency matrix of a digraph is usually asymmetric and so is its Laplacian, which
means that the spectrum loses many of its “nice” properties and is less easy to inter-
pret as properties of the graph itself; for example, random walks on digraphs may be
very slow to converge to the stable distribution. Even with all these concerns, it is clear
that this is an approach worth pursuing to understand spatial digraphs of directional
structures.
As an aside, random walks on digraphs are often studied for non-spatial situations,
such as search and linkages for Web pages based on the inﬂuence of other pages. This
process can involve ranking by importance as measured by weighted degree, for exam-
ple by the “PageRank” algorithm, named for Larry Page of Google (see Brin & Page
1998) which is closely related to degree centrality (cf. Newman 2010). This is also
related to the competition digraphs of Chapter 6, with the consistency of hierarchies of
competitive rankings and with the potential for reversals.
Another modiﬁcation of the basic random walk is to allow the walk to remain at
its currently occupied node with a given probability (say 0.5) at each iteration. This is
referred to as a “lazy random walk” and it has useful properties of its own. Other vari-
ations are random walks on evolving graphs or dynamic graphs (Avin et al. 2008) and
random walks “with choice” where the choice of the next node to be visited is inﬂu-
enced by the history of visits to the current node and (with weighting) to its neighbours
(Avin & Krishnamachari 2008; Alexandris & Karagiorgos 2014). Both these changes to
the basic model mimic aspects of realistic ecological circumstances, such as variation in
the suitability of links between habitat patches and the effects of past patch occupation
on current choices for dispersal.
Studying random walks on graphs provides insight into graph theory’s application to
landscape ecology. It can inform intuitive appreciation of how structure affects dispersal

patterns and potential recolonization, when the movement of organisms is considered
to be unintentional (possible?) and unbiased (unlikely?). The implications should affect
our interpretation of how landscape structure affects patterns of dispersal and coloniza-
tion and thus the design of multi-patch reserves. Again, it is to be emphasized that the
determination of which pairs of patches are truly joined by the equivalent of the graph’s
edge will have a large effect on the outcomes described here.
9.3.4
End of Detour: Back to Connectivity
The study of random walks on graphs provides background and advice for choosing a
measure of connectivity and to understand its properties. How does it respond to the
structural details that affect random walks? It may help to run random walks on the spa-
tial structure of the system being studied. While this is just one approach to evaluating
connectivity measures, it is an important one since it permits an assessment in complex
spatial structures. Because there are many measures to choose from, prior evaluation is
obviously a good idea.
To Do: Choose a measure of the chosen version of connectivity that is well behaved
in random walks and understand its properties, even to the extent of running random
walks on the spatial structure of your system.
To help inform choice among the spatial indices as indicators of ecological connectiv-
ity, a summary is provided in table form (Table 9.3). This attempts a synopsis of many
sources including Pascual-Hortal and Saura (2006), Galpern et al. (2011), Baranyi et al.
(2011), Rayﬁeld et al. (2011) and Yu et al. (2013). The summary is much more speciﬁc
than the general discussion of graph-theoretical connectivity for spatial graphs; its focus
is on measures for ecological connectivity and it does not include all measures from the
publications cited.
In this table, the nodes represent habitat patches and their locations (the patch cen-
troid), usually as (xi, yi), with patch area as a possible weight, ai; and the edges
join the patches, usually centroid-to-centroid, with the associated physical distance,
dAB (labelled nodes) or dij (indexed). The edges represent potential dispersal between
patches. The edges are symmetric, so not directed, and a node’s degree, di, is just the
number of edges attached to it. Path length between nodes can be measured by the num-
ber of edges, the shortest being the geodesic distance δij or δ(A,B), or by the sum of the
physical lengths of the edges in the path, dp (A,B).
Clearly, the measures are not all independent, and not all the overlaps of the measures
have been commented on explicitly in Table 9.3. We will want to be able to compare
graphs or components of different sizes, and so the most useful indices are those that can
be ﬁrst made relative to the number of nodes, n, and then for the number of edges, m. The
most interesting and useful indices may be those that evaluate aspects of the structure
of the spatial graphs beyond the density of edges m/n; for example, the properties of the
spectral gap, which respond to structural robustness even in sparse graphs, merits further
investigation. Donetti et al. (2006) have suggested an iterative “re-wiring” approach to

Connectedness:
connected versus
not connected
All node pairs have a path between them
versus some pairs have none. Digraphs
can also be “strongly,” “unilaterally,” or
“weakly” connected.
Connectedness allows inter-patch
dispersal and recolonization after
extinction; disconnected does not.
Connectivity
# independent paths between A and B or κ:
κn = minimum # nodes or
κe = minimum # edges removed to
disconnect
Related to robustness of network to
loss of patch or inter-patch link.
Cut-nodes and
cut-edges
# cut-nodes
# cut-edges
Larger numbers indicate greater
vulnerability to disconnection and
reduced dispersal.
Connectance
Proportion of edge positions actually with
an edge:
c(G) = m/
 n
2

Relative density of edges can be
related to ease and probability of
movement between patches.
Node degree
di: a local measure for node i
This is the number of neighbours at
δ(u,v) = 1
Higher node degree gives more links
for possible dispersal; random walk
suggests more organisms.
Average node degree
d.(G) = m/2: a global measure
Higher value suggests more dispersal
possible.
Variance of node
degrees
s2(di): inequitable versus uniform degree
distribution
High variance indicates “hub and
spoke” conﬁguration: rapid
dispersal; low value indicates low
differentiation: slower dispersal,
higher stability (?)
Buffered neighbour
counts
The proportion of nodes as neighbours at
δ(u,v) = 1, 2, 3, . . . Local or global
measures.
Both mean and variance can be used (see
Labonne et al. 2008).
Higher means at shorter distances
reﬂect more close source nodes;
Variance reﬂects spatial heterogeneity
Components
K components: X1, . . . , XK K = 1 is a
connected graph; K > 1 is disconnected.
Closely related to algebraic connectivity; K
is also the number of 0 eigenvalues of
the Laplacian matrix.
More components mean more and
smaller isolated subgroups of
patches.
Component “size”
# nodes (“order”): Xk has nk nodes
# edges: Xk has mk nodes
Total of patch area: Ak = 	
i∈Xk
αi
Related to pool of organisms for
inter-patch dispersal and to ease of
dispersal.
Related to number of organisms
available for dispersal.
Graph diameter
Max(δij): geodesic path length
Max(dp(vi,vj)); sum of physical edge
lengths
Smaller diameter may allow faster
dispersal throughout landscape.
Component
diameter, XK
Max(δij | both nodes in XK): geodesic path
length
Max(dp(vi,vj | both nodes in XK): sum of
physical edge lengths
Smaller diameter may allow faster
dispersal throughout component.
Algebraic
connectivity
This is the second smallest eigenvalue of
the Laplacian matrix (the number of 0
eigenvalues is the number of
components).
Larger values indicate greater
robustness and fault tolerance; also
the ease of synchronization in a
dynamic network (Chung 1997).

Spectral gap
Like algebraic the gap between the ﬁrst
and second eigenvalues of the adjacency
matrix, , indicates when nodes have
robust connections to other nodes, even
with few edges.
Larger values suggest robust structure
even for sparse graphs
(Yazdani & Jeffrey 2010); in random
walks, it gives faster convergence to
limiting distribution.

Its variance is another global measure, as

ﬁnding optimal network topologies (see Figure 9.11), such as avoiding the vulnerability
of network structures based on highly connected central hubs; this too merits further
investigation for ecological applications.
Table 9.3 is based only on topology or distances in symmetric graphs. Once the edges
have other weights attached to them such as cost or resistance or directional bias, a
second set of measures related to connectivity come into play. These include measures
related to ﬂow capacity and the probability of movement, least cost paths, and circuit
theory’s “sum of all paths” alluded to in the discussion of random walks. The descrip-
tion of random walks explained why a node’s degree could be a reasonable measure
of connectivity; the same reasoning works for the “buffered node neighbour counts”
(Labonne et al. 2008), the numbers of nodes that have path lengths of δ(u,v) = 1, 2,
3, . . . ; more neighbours can act as more proximate sources for random walks or dis-
persal to the focus node, provided they themselves do not have too many neighbours.
(Both the mean and the variance of these counts have properties related to connectivity,
as indicated in Table 9.3.) The same reasoning about node degrees applies with mod-
iﬁcations when the edges have weights associated with them, provided the variance of
those weights is not extreme.
Much of the work on landscape “archipelagos” has focussed on the metapopula-
tion concept of individual species of interest and the effects of landscape structure,
as reﬂected in its spatial graph, on local extinction and recolonization probabilities and
rates (Hanski 2009; Fall et al. 2007). Other studies have looked more broadly at the
effects of landscape characteristics on the interacting species in the metacommunity,
such as plants and their pollinators and their community diversity (Spiesman & Inouye
2013).
The graph-theoretical toolbox typically looks at the vulnerability of dispersal to
landscape fragmentation or to path depletion through cut-points and cut-edges, or the
requirement for longer (or thus more costly) paths to maintain connectivity. In all of
these, the graph nodes are abstracts of the real patches in the landscape, which have
shape, area, topography, composition and so on, and the graph edges from which dis-
persal paths are composed are not necessarily real dispersal routes that might be fol-
lowed (Figure 9.14). Connections through paths that are shorter or safer, or less costly
in energy or other “currency” are often the focus of studies; and those edges are the
ones preferred for graph construction, on the criterion of a smaller “effective distance”
between habitat patches (see Chardon et al. 2003; Urban et al. 2009; Rayﬁeld et al.
2011). This may include a determination of the single “best” path between nodes, based
on least cost, least risk or highest rate of success. The lack of barriers and the central-
ity of nodes are other factors to be compared with the observed movement or inferred
dispersal of the organisms of interest (Garroway et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2008). For
example, in a study of the landscape genetics of ﬁsher (Martes pennanti) populations
in Ontario, node centrality was correlated with the proportion of immigrants, suggest-
ing that the central nodes were high-quality habitat sources of emigrants to other lower
quality sites (Garroway et al. 2008). Hock and Mumby (2015) suggested the use of
reliability weights for the stochastic links between patches, based on the probability that
one patch has a “direct effect” on the other; the most reliable path between non-adjacent

patches can then be determined using Dijkstra’s algorithm on the log-transformed relia-
bility weights (Hock & Mumby 2015).
Extending the concepts of connectivity and dispersal beyond the “best” path, McRae
et al. (2008) used circuit theory, which integrates the effectiveness of many paths for dis-
persal, to evaluate and predict genetic dispersal in several species. This method looks at
the sum of all possible paths, rather than trying to determine which one is best. In two
different organisms, mahogany trees and wolverines, the “resistance distance,” which
incorporates multiple paths, gave much better predictions of observed gene ﬂow than
geographic distances or least cost (McRae & Beier 2007). This is a promising develop-
ment in the application of graph theory in ecology, and of course, the study of electrical
circuits is frequently cited as an early inspiration and application of network theory
(Kirchhoff 1847; West 2001).
9.3.5
Dendritic Connectivity and Diversity
As familiar as the archipelago context or metaphor may be, and despite the usefulness
of spatial graph theory for metacommunities in these insular systems (with parallels for
landscape patches), spatial graphs can also be very informative about dendritic systems
such as drainage basins or the rivers within them. The dendritic systems we study in
ecology can be characterized as follows:
r Usually aquatic, but not always
r Almost always connected, but not always
r Almost all directional
r As abstracted graphs, almost all the same form: rooted trees
r As spatial graphs, almost all two-dimensional, planar, and the same shape (sort of)

Digraph
Figure 9.15 Map of river system and one version of its digraph: ﬁlled nodes are junctions; hollow
nodes are reaches.
These systems represent a special case of the archipelago model for conservation ecol-
ogy, and are special in two ways. First, movement within the network is highly direc-
tional for most organisms; that is, downstream. Second, the structure is highly con-
strained, and there are choices as to how the physical system is translated into a graph
(see Grant et al. 2007). An obvious version is to identify the nodes as the junctions of
streams with the edges being identiﬁed with the stream reaches that link them. Here,
both nodes and edges represent habitat, possibly of different characteristics, so that the
edges are now “real” objects, not just abstracted or potential connections. This conven-
tion produces nodes that have an in-degree of 2 and an out-degree of 1 (Figure 9.15,
solid nodes). Another choice is to include the stream reaches as a separate set of nodes
having in-degree 1 and out-degree 1 (Figure 9.15, open nodes), with the advantage of
showing explicitly that the river reaches are to be considered as habitat locations with
the same status as conﬂuences (cf. Grant et al. 2007). Other possibilities include sample
locations as nodes (Figure 9.16), possibly many per stream unit, each with their own
constraints on the graph’s characteristics. Of course, these constraints are determined
by the physical structure of the systems as well as choices for the graph elements, but
the constraints can make interpretation more straightforward.
The directional nature of these systems and the bias it introduces to movement is
expected to affect metapopulation dynamics and community similarity. To complement
that intuition, the digraphs that represent these systems produce asymmetric matri-
ces and the random walk results for understanding connectivity become less easy to
derive. However, random walks on these directed graphs still provide understanding of
some of their properties. The directionality has strong effects on the overall connec-
tivity and dynamics on the system network, with particular problems related to nodes

that have zero in-degree or zero out-degree. Multiple random walks can speed up the
total cover time in most graphs, as described in Section 9.3.3, but that is essential for
many digraphs. All this suggests that, as suspected, the asymmetry of these digraphs
has important implications for ecological applications.
In fact, modelling exercises demonstrate that asymmetric connectivity can have a
detrimental effect on metapopulation persistence (Bode et al. 2008). In most dendritic
aquatic networks, the directionality is strong and directed graphs can depict and quantify
the connections and distances between node pairs (Fagan 2002; Grant et al. 2007; Schick
& Lindley 2007, Figure 2c). In these dendritic digraphs, Cote et al. (2009) proposed a
new dendritic connectivity index, based on the number of barriers and the probability
that each one can be passed upstream or downstream; this provides a measure of stream
connectivity as appropriate for the directional structure. A more familiar concept is
the “buffered node neighbour counts” suggested by Labonne et al. (2008) for dendritic
structure graphs; these are the numbers of nodes that have path lengths of δ(u,v) = 1,
2, 3, . . . Both the mean and the variance can be useful measures of properties related
to connectivity (listed in Table 9.3), and Labonne et al. (2008) using distances up to
5, found similar behaviour for all ten metrics (mean and variance each at of ﬁve dis-
tances) for metapopulation persistence in individual-based models of demography in
dendritic networks. However connectivity is measured or evaluated using node removal
analysis (looking for “stepping-stone sites” or cut-nodes), the dendritic structure and
directional asymmetry affect rates of extinction and genetic isolation, metapopulation
size and persistence, and local variation in species diversity (Treml et al. 2008; Schick
& Lindley 2007; Labonne et al. 2008; Bode et al. 2008; Carrara et al. 2012), with at

least some of these being affected by the interaction between connectivity and sizes of
the patches thus connected (Carrara et al. 2014). Sophisticated randomization tests may
not be needed to detect the basic characteristics of some of these data sets, but more
research on this application of graph theory to ecological systems can form the founda-
tion of more general conclusions; that seems like a very worthwhile ﬁeld of endeavour.
For applications of these techniques in ecological studies, as in many other areas of
data analysis, in spatial networks there is an important and sometimes difﬁcult relation-
ship between the scale of the process being studied, the scale of the data recorded, and
the scale at which the analysis is performed (Caceres & Berger-Wolf 2013; see also Dale
& Fortin 2014, Figure 1.8). There is clearly much more to be done in the use of spa-
tial graphs and the theory that goes with them to help understand the effects of spatial
structure on ecological function, especially when the structure is asymmetrical. Look-
ing at random walks on graphs can help to formalize or to correct our intuitions about
the consequences of connectivity and its different forms. More formal investigations
of connectivity, both in graph theory and in ecology, are called for to provide a better
understanding.
You can do this too.
9.4
Concluding Comments
When the outline of this book was originally developed, spatial and spatio-temporal
graphs dominated, and in the context of the work on spatial graphs, so did applications
related to diversity and conservation. The ﬁnal allocation is more even among the kinds
of graphs and the applications described, but the area of spatial and spatio-temporal
graphs in conservation ecology remains one of the most active areas for graph theory
in ecology. The reconciliation of ecological connectivity and graph theory measures is
unresolved, but certainly worth more investigation and discussion. An important dis-
tinction is the difference between analysis based on a graph like the Minimum Span-
ning Tree imposed on the data and used only as a skeleton to investigate properties like
autocorrelation, and analysis of the same spatial data using a graph based on other infor-
mation and more thoroughly based on graph-theoretical concepts. One example of the
latter would be evidence for functional connectivity, which is a key factor in conserva-
tion ecology.
Spatial graphs, as abstract maps, have intuitive appeal for ecologists, but many appli-
cations of interest involve temporal processes on the graphs (such as extinction or dis-
persal) or dynamics of the graphs themselves (such as loss of a node or the formation of
a new edge). These considerations lead naturally to investigations of a spatial-temporal
context for graphs and graph theory. That’s what’s next.

Spatio-temporal Graphs
Introduction
Ecological processes occur both in space and in time. Although in some circumstances
it is useful to generalize by abstracting structure and function from these dimensions,
in other cases, it is important to retain the information of spatial and temporal location.
Having described spatial graphs, in which the nodes have spatial locations, and tem-
poral networks, in which persistent nodes have locations in time, an obvious approach
that retains information on both spatial and temporal locations is to use spatio-temporal
graphs. Spatio-temporal data are simply data that have labels telling when and where
they were collected, which is a requirement of good science (Cressie & Wikle 2011,
Chapter 1). Such data can be used to form a graph by adding edges between data loca-
tions, with the edges determined by any one of a large set of criteria. Following Cressie
and Wikle (2011), the treatment of space and time is expected to remain in the scales
where Newtonian physical laws can be assumed, which gives the option of treating
both space and time as continuous variables to which continuous models, both formal
and informal, can be applied. For either space or time, discrete-space and discrete-time
models are also options, either arising from continuous versions then discretized, or
from the data as originally collected, such as observations on a spatial grid or at regular
time intervals (see Cressie & Wikle 2011, Chapter 6).
Lightning strikes are discrete events, but they can provide data located in continuous
time and continuous space. Those locations in continuous dimensions can be converted
into discrete format. For example, the US National Lightning Detection Network distin-
guishes and records cloud-to-ground lightning events and their polarity with excellent
location accuracy (200 m) and time precision (0.5 microsecond RMS), so that the data
are in continuous time and continuous spatial dimensions (see www.vaisala.com/en/
products/thunderstormandlightningdetectionsystems/Pages/NLDN.aspx).
Lightning strikes are usually treated as if they have no duration and a single location
in space. These data can then be “binned” into discrete time and space, for example by 1
minute or 24 hour periods and by square kilometre or US county. Similarly, Blitzortung
is a citizens’ lightning detection network, which allows you to hear and to see, on a map,
lightning strikes in real time as they occur and you can track them as the storm that gen-
erates them moves across the country. (Very cool! Check out http://en.blitzortung.org/
live_lightning_maps.php?map=30.) Another example that also gives data in continu-
ous time is the old-fashioned hygrothermograph, which produces continuous records

of temperature and humidity drawn on a paper-covered cylinder revolving at a constant
speed. Modern digital versions produce discrete-time data by recording at regular inter-
vals. Obviously, either version gives data from one location, and so an array of a number
of such machines produces data that are in a single spatial arrangement.
In a spatio-temporal graph, the nodes have locations in time and in space; Figure
10.1 shows the locations of cloud-to-ground lightning strikes with the spatial location
being the centre of the oval in the x-y plane, and the temporal location being the dis-
tance above that plane. The edges have end-points with locations (the nodes) but they
may not be truly or fully located in those dimensions along their length, representing
abstracted connections between nodes. The edges can represent trajectories, however,
where appropriate (Figure 10.2). The simplest would be the almost straight paths such
as those of “trapline” foraging bees (think of the term “a bee line”!), which have been
the subject of much research (see e.g. Osborne et al. 1999; Lihoreau et al. 2013), but
curvilinear is also a possibility where the data allow or physical structures constrain
(ﬁsh migrating up a mountain stream). There is no need for the dimensions of time and
space to be fully Euclidean and literal; three spatial dimensions can be reduced to two
or even one, as in the Feynman diagram of particle physics (see also Figures 7.3–7.6
in Cressie & Wikle 2011). Compared to strictly spatial graphs, or to time-only graphs,
having both space and time greatly increases the range of ecological phenomena that
can be covered, but also the number of ways that the data can be treated, analyzed and
interpreted. Whatever dimensions and data are used, spatio-temporal graphs provide a
ﬂexible treatment to depict, analyze and model complicated ecological phenomena with
spatially and temporally explicit structure and dynamics.
Spatio-temporal graphs can be constructed or portrayed in many ways, based on
whether time or space are continuous or discrete, and on the characteristics of the nodes
and edges (e.g. transient, persistent, labelled or not and so on). For example, continu-
ous time is often split up for practical reasons into time slices, with potential changes
in edges between them, and the option of identity edges if required (Figure 10.3). This

approach allows the possibility of a simple all-times summary of the edges by labelling
with the time slices in which they were present (Figure 10.4); it also permits keeping
track of individuals (nodes) that move (Figure 10.5).
All the possibilities cannot be covered here, nor can all the variations that can be use-
fully applied to ecological studies. Events in time make it possible to determine rates. If
data on the locations of occurrences are available, the data will provide information on
distances (sometimes functional distances as well as geographic or physical distances).
Compared to temporal graphs or to spatial graphs, the spatio-temporal ones have emer-
gent properties; in this case, speed or velocity, which requires both intervals in time and
distances in space. Because distance can be measured in more than one way (geographic
or physical, path length or cost and so on), there is more than one kind of speed that can
be derived for any pair of nodes and time span.
The second emergent property of ecological systems available in spatio-temporal
graphs, but not in time-only or space-only structures, is dynamic spatial (neighbour)
interactions. This broad category includes phenomena like the spread of disease and
ecological memory in community succession, which there is persistence of characteris-
tics or lasting effects of the neighbourhood’s past conditions on successional changes.
These effects are closely tied to both temporal and spatial autocorrelation in the
phenomenon studied, and either can be positive or negative, depending on the phe-
nomenon and spatial and temporal scales. By combining rates with locations, spatio-
temporal graphs also enable us to investigate location-speciﬁc or habitat-speciﬁc rates,
for example, in studying the seasonal sequence of ﬂower anthesis and of pollinator
activity.

Temporal graphs, as described in Chapter 8, permit a very useful hierarchy of
restricted randomizations for hypothesis testing, and adding spatial information to
the graphs extends this facility and permits a sophisticated approach to the study of
how space and time affect the ecological systems we study. Furthermore with spatio-
temporal networks, theoretical models can be simulated to determine potential processes
that could have produced the observed network.

10.1
Characteristics
Because there are so many different applications of spatio-temporal graphs in ecology,
these can be placed in broad categories based on what kind of data the nodes and edges
represent and whether time and space are continuous or discrete. Very broadly: are the
nodes persistent at locations or do they represent objects that are short-lived or objects
that move? Do the edges contain information beyond the structure of connections they
represent? Consider a list of ecological examples (very incomplete!) and the nature of
their data:
Lightning strikes that reach the ground.
Nodes are the spatio-temporal locations of the strikes. Processes are storm evolution
and movement and the production of cloud-to-ground lightning.
Forest stand permanent plots: effects of neighbours and history on tree stems.
Nodes are the stems with their spatial locations, and conditions observed at different
time periods. Processes are dispersal, germination, response to abiotic conditions,
competition, growth, senescence and death.
Successional sequences of patches in a landscape (ecological memory).
Nodes are the patches with spatial locations and their states observed at time inter-
vals. Processes are dispersal, response to abiotic conditions, facilitation, compe-
tition, predation and local extinction.
.011
15:27:45

10.1 Characteristics
227
Animal movement through landscapes (foraging). Nodes are the animals with spa-
tial locations for each, recorded at time intervals, possibly in the context of the
landscape patches where they occur. Processes include local movements within a
patch, dispersal between patches and migration.
Plant clonal growth by rhizomes or stolons.
Nodes are the plant stems with spatial locations, and recorded times of process
responses: shoot appearance, growth, ﬂowering and senescence.
Disease spread through populations (mobile or sessile): orderly or unpredictable.
Nodes are individuals located in space with their states (susceptible, diseased,
removed) recorded at time intervals. Processes include transmission, infection,
recovery and death.
Metacommunities: Community diversity in real and virtual archipelagos.
Nodes are the “islands” which have locations in space and compositional data
recorded at time intervals. Processes include dispersal, establishment, migration
and local extinction.
The range of data types is clearly large: from sporadic lightning strikes which are dis-
crete events of little duration but with locations in continuous time and space, to the
slow continuous processes of growth, ageing and replacement observed in permanent
forest plots at intervals of years, with associated measures of tree stem species, size and
status. One way to appreciate this diversity is to classify the spatio-temporal data and
their treatments by creating a table of the combinations of characteristics. The details
of the original objects or events of interest will not always match those of the data that
records them and that then form the basis for the graph. Table 10.1 is one version of
such a table (modiﬁed from Dale & Fortin 2014, Table 11.2).
Clearly, there are too many possibilities and combinations for all to be described in
detail, far less worked through, but the list does provide an impression of the ﬂexibil-
ity available. The “taxonomy” of these graphs is important because the same graph-
theoretical property (e.g. connectivity) can mean different things depending on context
(one time observation vs a series of many times). They also can have different implica-
tions if the graph is constructed as a scaffolding or framework on which to base analysis
or if it is a real product of the system and its dynamics. That fact leads to some important
questions:
Where are the data to be analyzed?
Is the information in the locations of the nodes?
The labels of the nodes? The locations of the edges? The sequence of the edges?
Their labels? How is graph theory to be applied to be most helpful?
The answers to all these questions depend on the systems and processes being studied
and the nature of the data that have been collected. Because of the broad range of pos-
sibilities, it is impossible or unhelpful to generalize or to attempt general principles, but
examining several examples with such questions in mind will help. Before those exam-
ples, however, there are two properties of spatio-temporal graphs or networks that are
general features to note.

10 Spatio-temporal Graphs
Table 10.1 Characteristics of Spatio-temporal Graphs
Time
The original events or objects may be long-lasting or of very short duration; their records may
be in continuous form, or in discrete intervals (e.g. equal steps or order of occurrence; time
“slices”)
Continuous-time data can be converted to the discrete form by “binning”
Explicit time course records can be converted to an integrative summary of the whole time
course
Explicit time values or temporal labels (e.g. time period)
Space
The original events or objects may be point events or they may have length, area or volume;
their records may be as continuous data (e.g. real number x,y coordinates) or in discrete
format, such as raster, mosaic/polygon or object-referenced data
Continuous data can be converted to the discrete form by “binning”
Number of spatial dimensions: 1D, 2D, 3D, as dictated by the system
Nodes
Time: instantaneous (duration close to 0), ephemeral (short duration), transient or intermittent,
persistent/permanent
If persistent: constant or variable in characteristic of interest (e.g. size, state, quality)
Temporal characteristics: one time snapshot (of contemporaneous nodes) versus integrative
summary of many time periods versus sequential time course (nodes as “ancestors” and
“descendants”)
Space: ﬁxed or stationary versus moving
Representing: locations, objects, events
Properties: categorical, qualitative or quantitative labels; associated functions
Edges
Time: instantaneous (duration close to 0), ephemeral (short duration), transient or intermittent,
persistent/permanent
If persistent: constant or variable in characteristic of interest (e.g. ﬂow rate)
Temporal characteristics: a single time period versus summary graphs of many time periods
indicating contemporaneity versus sequential time course (e.g. edges linking “ancestors and
descendants” or “identity” edges linking instances of the same node)
Space: symmetric versus asymmetric or directional
Representing: connections, processes, relationships, objects
Properties: categorical, qualitative or quantitative labels (including signs); associated
functions; implicit directionality from any temporal extension
Comment
Kisilevich et al. (2010) have provided a different framework for their taxonomy based on
spatial extension (points, lines or areas), spatial location (ﬁxed or dynamic) and temporal
extension (single snapshot, updated snapshot or time series).
10.2
Two Spatio-temporal Properties
To start, the focus is on the application of spatio-temporal graphs for investigating issues
most directly related to conservation ecology, including landscape dynamics, diversity,
succession and ecological memory, but also topics related to the movement of organ-
isms, including animal movement, clonal growth and the spread of disease.
10.2.1
Spatio-temporal Distance and Path Length
In adapting many familiar graph measures for spatio-temporal graphs, the tricky part
is deﬁning distance or path length within the graph that combines spatial and temporal

distances in a sensible and useful manner. Then, the rest should easy! The problem is
that time and space are not usually commensurable, so there is no easy equivalence to
allow a combined measure of multidimensional distance, and thus no obvious way to
ﬁnd the shortest paths between any two nodes, or the nodes that are closest together in
space and time (Jacquez 1996). The problem of lack of commensurability in searching
for spatio-temporal clusters is easily resolved by using “cylinders” as templates for scan
statistics that are equal in their spatial dimensions, but of set length in time (Iyengar
2005; see also Takahashi et al. 2008). This is the equivalent of setting two independent
threshold values, one for space and one for time. Two easy ﬁxes are as follows:
1 For cases with ﬁxed permanent nodes, spatially deﬁned distance may be all that is
needed for useful measures such as centrality; in a reduced-to-space-only graph, the
distance between nodes is what is important.
2 If time occurs as discrete steps, there are many pairs of nodes throughout the time lay-
ers that are the same temporal distance apart, and so ﬁnding the least spatial distance
among those pairs with equal temporal distances may be the solution.
Under special situations, there may be a natural choice for time and distance com-
mensurability, based on the concepts described for random walks on undirected graphs
(Chapter 9). If the system is a landscape of habitat patches and dispersal between them
is linked to a seasonal or annual cycle, it may be reasonable to consider a rule of “one
step per cycle,” adjusting the deﬁnition of neighbouring patches to capture the usual
physical distance of dispersal. This then allows the use of random walks as conceptual
or simulation models for the processes of dispersal in this system.
10.2.2
Hierarchical Tests with Spatio-temporal Neighbours
In spatial graphs (space only), for any set of nodes, there are many different rules for
determining edges, permitting a range of connectivity from dense and highly connected
(e.g. the complete graph with edges for all possible pairs), to very sparse (e.g. single
nearest neighbours) (see Figure 10.6). This range of rules allows precise hierarchical
hypothesis evaluation: combining contrasting edge rules with conventional statistics to
measure dependence, predictions about the characteristics of individual nodes can be
.011
15:27:45

10 Spatio-temporal Graphs
made and compared. The complete graph is the equivalent of the null hypothesis that all
other nodes are equally good predictors of a node’s condition, whereas a more restricted
set of neighbours examines the possibility that only (for example) the nearest nodes have
related values. This approach compares the results for a null hypothesis condition (with
some limitations for nodes and edges) with those of the alternate-hypothesis condition
with more restrictions. For example, to test the effects of various kinds of neighbours,
the null hypothesis is provided by the complete graph, equivalent to having all the other
nodes exerting equal inﬂuence on the characteristics of the focal node. The alternative
hypothesis is determined by the graph of ﬁrst-order neighbours in a Delaunay triangula-
tion, equivalent to the claim that those neighbours provide the best explanatory factors,
or by only the ﬁrst nearest neighbour for each node (Figure 10.6).
This concept can be summarized as:
{H0 = complete graph} ≡“All nodes inﬂuence the focal node equally.”
{H1 = Delaunay graph} ≡“Only those ﬁrst-order neighbours inﬂuence the focal
node.”
{H2 = nearest neighbour graph} ≡“Only the single closest node affects the focal
node.”
Spatio-temporal graphs allow the same hierarchical testing with yet more ﬂexibility.
Consider a widespread population of plants for which the phenological sequences of
the appearance of leaves and ﬂowers have been recorded for many years. The timing of
events for any plant can then be evaluated based on a hierarchy of neighbours in space
and time:
H0 No structure: Use all possible edges in time and space (the complete spatio-
temporal graph). This is the hypothesis that similarity is independent of time lags
and geographic distances.
H1 “Regional” structure: All edges between ﬁrst-order neighbours in space and
time using one of several edge rules that can give different edge densities (MST,
Gabriel, Delaunay, . . . ): the hypothesis is that similarity is broadly dependent on
time lag and geographic distance (Figure 10.7, top).
H2 “Local” structure: Only edges between closest neighbours in space and time
(Figure 10.7, bottom).
This is equivalent to the hypothesis that similarity depends only on the shortest time
differences and shortest spatial distances.
This is in a spatio-temporal context and so there are other alternatives to be tested.
H0 No structure: independence, as above.
HS Only space matters: Edges occur between spatial neighbours, but not between
instances of the same individual at different times. If the control of variation in
phenology is based on location, regional or neighbourhood effect, there are no
individual effects, and no history (Figure 10.8, top).
HT Individual control: Only temporal edges between instances of the same plant at
different times are used, possibly with several time lags (t −1, t −2, . . . ). The

representation of the hierarchy and the relationships within it. Admittedly, however, the
graphs used to depict the relationships are created by the hierarchical structure for test-
ing, and so there is very little that real graph theory can tell us about our data. However,
if there are quantitative measures associated with the edges, or even with the nodes, then
there is much more that we can do in comparing measures of centrality or the resistance
of causal paths, and so on.
10.3
Examples of Ecological Applications
The range of applications for spatio-temporal graphs in ecological studies is so diverse
that it is difﬁcult to provide general advice or to abstract from that range a list of com-
mon measures that may be useful. Instead, it is probably most useful to go through a
list of examples that cover much of that range, and learning case-by-case, measures and
techniques to use.
10.3.1
Lightning Strikes
Here a database may consist of the spatial coordinates of cloud-to-ground lightning
strikes for a particular geographic area (continuous space) and the times at which
they occur (continuous time), see Figure 10.1a. The permanent records of those strikes
are the nodes. For most purposes, a summary graph that covers an extended block of
time would probably be sufﬁcient, given adequate labels, rather than requiring separate
graphs for individual days. Obvious choices for the edges of a graph (of course, it could
be empty), are edges joining nodes into (a) spatial clusters, (b) temporal clusters and
(c) spatio-temporal clusters as in Figure 10.9 (Tango 2010; see Kisilevich et al. 2010).
The three clustering results can then be compared to look for trends and orderliness
in time and in space. The nodes can be classiﬁed according to the characteristics of the
lightning strike itself, such as multiplicity and polarity, and edges assigned then between
nodes based on those categories. The goal is, of course, prediction, and so cluster detec-
tion is not sufﬁcient by itself, but the sequencing of locations is important. This is one
example in which the time-only version of the graph that gives temporal clustering and
spacing and the spatial network that can be derived both have useful information for the
researcher.
Alternatives include drawing edges between nodes that are strikes of the same polar-
ity, energy level, or strike multiplicity, in an effort to detect lightning signatures of other
phenomena. There appears to be a spatial correlation of total rainfall with total electrical
activity and with positive cloud-to-ground strikes (Soula & Chauzy 2001). More specif-
ically, a study in Texas showed that tornado touchdown was preceded by an increased
rate of lightning strikes, an increased proportion of positive polarity strikes, and a spatial
concentration of strikes along the tornado path (Snow et al. 2007).

10.3.2
Permanent Forest Sample Plots
Permanent plots are established in forest stands with all large individual tree stems
mapped and measured, along with recorded comments on condition, such as disease
or mortality (see Figure 10.3). The plots are then monitored at intervals to determine
the effects of neighbouring stems and past conditions on the fates of individual stems,
giving one graph per observation time period. The spatial locations of the stems and
the dates of the observation are important facts giving the context for any analysis. The
graphs to be used are the neighbour networks described in Chapter 1 of this book, within
any time period, with edges deﬁning spatio-temporal neighbours in addition to identity
edges between time intervals (Figure 10.4).
The goal is to predict the fate of individual stems based on the data from preceding
observation periods, and so the recommended approach is to use an iterative process of
evaluating the ability of the data from spatial and temporal “neighbours” including the
focal tree itself to predict changes in its status (vigorous, living, suppressed, diseased,
moribund, dead . . . ). The hierarchy of neighbours from all stems at all times through
reductions in the numbers of spatial neighbours and in the length of history considered

to perhaps only the three nearest neighbours and only time t −1, allows an evaluation
of what is truly important in determining the stem’s fate.
The analysis is closely related to spatial point pattern analyses, especially mark cor-
relation analysis, which looks at the spatial scales of positive and negative correlation of
quantitative characteristics (see Dale & Fortin 2014, Chapter 4.2). The nodes can appear

or disappear between observation times. The edges of the graph form a scaffolding for
the analysis; but they are determined by the researcher, and so are not themselves data
for analysis. The graph structure is the context, and the information for analysis is in
the time-indexed measures and conditions (“marks”) associated with each stem (Figure
10.10a). The result here is one graph per time period, and these can certainly be com-
bined into a single graph consisting of many layers or tiers, one for each time slice. It
is not clear that there are any real advantages to doing this if the only edges running
between time slices are “identity edges” joining instances of the same individual.
Another way to look at such data is to see them as a set of temporal series, each with a
spatial location. The question is then that of the relationship among the temporal series,
based on their spatial locations, such as the effects of ﬁrst-order, second-order and third-
order neighbours; the characteristics that are most important in those relationships; the
quantiﬁcation of those effects; and so on. Directional edges in space and time could
illustrate speculation about sources of competition and suppression among trees (Figure
10.10b).
Summary

tory and neighbour histories; effect of neighbour graph deﬁnitions, path lengths and
inter-neighbour distances, both by geodesic distance (spatial order) and time lag
r Comparisons: geodesic distances versus physical distances; possible effects of site
differences (e.g. slope) and weather (drought)
r Closely related to marked point pattern analysis
10.3.3
Ecological Memory in Landscape Patch Dynamics
Very simply, “ecological memory” is the set of processes that determine the degree to
which an ecological system is affected by its past, together with some evaluation of
that effect (Peterson 2002). Ecological memory is partly derived from the interaction
of plants and propagules, mobile links such as seed dispersers, and biological legacies,
such as remnant trees and vegetation patches in a disturbed landscape (see Garcia et al.
2011). In one example, seed dispersal resilience emerged from the ecological memory
conferred by the inter-annual variability in fruit production and the ability of thrushes
to track fruit resources across the fragmented landscape (Garcia et al. 2011). Ecological
memory also results from the network of species in a system, their interactions with
each other and with the environment, and the set of structures that allow recovery after
disturbance, thus being directly related to ecological resilience, which is the capacity of
the system to survive disturbance (Bengtsson et al. 2003).

Figure 10.11 Ecological memory: patch status depends on its history and on its neighbours’
characteristics (and probably more than just ﬁrst-order neighbours). Those neighbour
characteristics depend on their own histories.
A very simple model of landscape patch dynamics is based on classifying the patches
into a small number of categories or states, with transitions between any two states
either determined by history and environmental factors with thresholds and feedback
loops (“state and transition” models; Phillips 2011) or by simple probability as with
Markov models. Depending on the transition probabilities, this can lead to an orderly
temporal structure consisting of a cycle of states for each patch, particularly when the
transitions are governed by a ﬁrst-order Markov model with the probability depend-
ing only on the current state of the patch, not on its history and not on the states of
its neighbours. A more realistic model that includes both some of the patch’s own his-
tory (states in previous time periods) and characteristics of (at least) ﬁrst-order neigh-
bouring patches, leads to a much less orderly dynamic structure, which may be more
realistic.
As with the analysis of tree stems in permanent plots, the use of a range of graphs with
many-to-few neighbours considered for each patch, both in space and in time, combined
with similarity measures allow a determination of the spatial and temporal effects on the
directions of change in the landscape patches. Tanner et al. (1996) modelled the effects
of history (1 to 27 years) on the species composition of intertidal coral reefs and found
that although history was important in determining state transition probabilities, it really
had only little effect on the dynamics and structure of the system.
Here the data are descriptions of the “state” of each of a number of contiguous forest
stands or landscape patches as observed through a number of time periods. Most often,
the states are points or steps along a continuum, with demarcated transitions between
states. Each patch is represented by a node which has the spatial location of the patch
centroid, but the result is a rigid lattice of such nodes (discrete space). Time is also
discrete, with the system being observed, and the states recorded, periodically. There are
.011
15:27:45

10.3 Examples of Ecological Applications
237
three kinds of edges that can describe which versions of which patches are neighbours.
Temporal edges join each patch to one or more previous versions of itself. Spatial edges
join patches to current neighbours within the same time period, potentially deﬁned in
a number of different ways (topological or distance threshold rules, ﬁrst-, second-, and
third-order neighbours and so on). Spatio-temporal edges join a patch to a selection of
historical versions of its current spatial neighbours. This is usually set up as a multi-
layered or tiered graph, with one layer representing the spatial layout of each of several
time periods, with time-dependent edges running between layers (Figure 10.11). This is
one example where the multi-time graph is necessary because more than just identity
edges run between time slices.
Summary
r Observations at discrete time intervals, discrete space of landscape polygons
r One layer per time period in a many-layered graph
r Nodes permanent, recording stand or patch locations, but with state that may change
from time to time
r Edges based on temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal “neighbours” include past self
r Measures: rates and conditions for each state-to-state transition; effect of graph deﬁ-
nition of neighbours
r Comparisons: similar to Markov model analysis of transitions; non-stationarity is a
serious concern, especially under climate change
10.3.4
Animal Movement
Ecological studies of animal movement may be aimed at evaluating territoriality and
home range, for which the expectation is no net displacement over time; or at assess-
ing wide-ranging foraging without returning to a home base, dispersal or migration,
for which net displacement is expected. Part of either assessment may be to relate the
patterns of movement to characteristics of the landscape, such as vegetation type or
resource availability, or to time itself in the form of annual, seasonal or daily cycles. It
is usually assumed that the actual trajectory between observations is close enough to
the straight-line edge used as an approximation, but the danger of that assumption will
change with the tine elapsed between observations; one observation per 24 hours will
miss any diurnal cycles, apart from any other inaccuracies; but one observation every 3
minutes may not be an efﬁcient expenditure of effort.
It is more obvious for the context of no “home base,” perhaps, but one general char-
acteristic of graphs depicting animal movement is how direct or convoluted the paths
are, and there are a number of measures of path compactness or tortuosity available
(see summary of Dale & Fortin 2014, Chapter 11.6). From a graph theory approach,
a measure of interest would be the number of crossings of edges that occur, perhaps
expressed as a proportion of edges that cross others. For example, in Figure 10.12a,
steps 1 to 9 have fairly constant net movement in the same direction and have no edge
crossings. Steps 10 to 20, on the other hand, cover a more compact space, have little
net movement overall, and have a high proportion of crossings per edge, although the

crossings are between edges that are nearby in time. Figure 10.12b also has many edge
crossings, but they tend to involve edges that are farther apart in time. Indices of those
characteristics will clearly differentiate between the two parts of the graph, which are
intuitively distinct.
Typically, the data are a simple sequence of observed timed locations with movement
between them reasonably understood, perhaps with associated information on behaviour
or environment. Usually the time intervals are equally spaced, but even if not, the times
of observations are known, and a single graph is used for a number of observation
times. If the edges are not actual trajectories (or even if they are?), the sequence of
spatio-temporal locations of the graph nodes are the data, and distances and rates and
other measures, such as path tortuosity, can be calculated from them (Figure 10.12).

The moving animal creates sequentially appearing permanent nodes of location, with a
sequence of edges joining them, providing a pseudo-trajectory that provides an approx-
imation of the actual path followed.

of change (see Dale & Fortin 2014, Chapter 11.6)
10.3.5
Clonal Plants
Many of the characteristics of clonal plant growth are similar to those of interest for
animal foraging paths, but of course, as the plants “forage” they also reproduce, result-
ing in a branching path rather than a single exploration route (Figure 10.13, a sketch
based on Medeola virginiana; see Bell 1974; Cook 1988). For spatio-temporal graphs
of some kinds of clonal growth, more than one kind of node may be required, for
example branching points in the clonal structure may or may not also be aerial shoots
(Figure 10.13). Similarly, aerial shoots may have different behaviours depending on
whether they are ﬂowering shoots or vegetative. The number of node categories required
will depend on the biology of the plant and the mechanism of its spread, but it can
always be asked how efﬁciently do the various plant structures use the available space.

Figure 10.14 Clonal plant network of three clones with root grafts (circled), loosely based on
Populus tremuloides. This graph uses three kinds of nodes: branch points and stems, coded by
different shading for different clones, and root grafts (circled).
Del Mondo et al. (2010) used spatial, spatio-temporal and temporal graphs and neigh-
bour, descendant and ancestor relationships to model spatio-temporal evolution of a
clonal network, which they illustrated with the propagation of bramble plants by basal
shoots, layering, grafts and from seed.
Initial growth in this example combines features of animal movement and of the
spread of disease. The plant stems or their equivalents, the ramets, are the graph’s
nodes, each with a persistent spatial location, even if the ramets are themselves tran-
sient through time. Each node has at least one point in time associated with it: the time
or time period that it appeared. The times of other events associated with each ramet
may also be included (e.g. ﬂowering, fruiting, senescence, death), similar to records of
states and transitions in permanent sample plots. In addition to edges depicting neigh-
bour network structure, clonal proliferation has real trajectories, the rhizomes or other
structures by which clonal spread occurs. These structures link “ancestors” to “descen-
dants” and there should be graph edges that approximate them as closely as possible.
This is easy with above-ground runners (like strawberry) but less so with roots or rhi-
zomes underground. As with most our examples, there are other sets of edges possible,
and comparisons among the sets should prove fruitful: edges of the usual neighbour
networks, edges of contemporaneity, and edges of phenological (or other) similarity.
When clonal systems are well established, they frequently form a multi-individual
and multi-genet network by root grafts (Figure 10.14), so that they no longer resemble
simple animal foraging paths, but more closely resemble transportation networks like
rail systems or highways, transporting material of different kinds in different direc-
tions. This is true of clonal trees like aspen, single stem trees like pines that form
similar networks by root grafts, and also of fungi with rhizomorphs like Armillaria
(see Lamour et al. 2007) but also of multi-genera networks of vascular plants and
mycorrhizae (see Simard et al. 2012). The spatio-temporal graph that represents these

spatio-temporal networks then has characteristics of interest like those of transportation
networks, including reachability, centrality, and vulnerability or robustness to the loss
of network elements (cf. Williams & Musolesi 2016).

Disease Spread: Stationary Organisms
This application for spatio-temporal graphs was introduced by the model of a stand
of plants, which is monitored at intervals for the locations of a particular disease (or
equivalently an insect pest). The data are the locations of newly diseased plants and of
all others (Figure 10.15). More detailed labelling of the nodes can include (previously
diseased) recovered and (previously diseased) dead plants at each time of observation.
Even better would be information on resistant versus susceptible plants, but that may not
be known. The actual paths of infection may not be known, also, although there are some
rare cases in which this can be determined (Armillaria fungus with its rhizomorphs?)
(see Mihail & Bruhn 2005). The choice of nodes and their labels is straightforward,
but there are many different possibilities of the edges that we might use, either within
individual time “slices,” between or among time periods, or in a time-aggregated sum-
mary graph (see Chapter 8). It would be most useful to have edges between all possible
pairs, or between all neighbour pairs however deﬁned, that could be labelled “trans-
mission possible,” “transmission occurred,” and “transmission impossible,” but usually
that information is not available. Of the many choices for edge deﬁnitions, here are
four choices, all of which use planar graphs from the topological hierarchy that includes
the Minimum Spanning Tree, Gabriel graph, and Delaunay triangulation (see Chapters
1 and 9): (1) edges indicating contemporaneity of infection, one graph for each time
period (or a time-aggregated version with appropriate labelling); (2) most likely routes
from nearest infected neighbours (Figure 10.16), one per time slice or aggregated and
labelled; (3) Minimum Spanning Tree in a time-aggregated graph that is constrained to
using edges joining nodes that were infected one time unit apart (Figure 10.17, left);
or (4) a topological time-aggregated graph connecting all nodes ever infected (Figure
10.18, right; this same list is given in Dale & Fortin 2014, Section 11.8.3, Figure 11.24).

One way of looking at the time-aggregated graphs is that these are just spatial graphs
with temporal labels (i.e. not truly spatio-temporal), and of course that is true; but they
can be easily deconstructed, if necessary, into a more authentic spatio-temporal format.
For the study of how disease spreads, Figure 10.19 illustrates the reasoning behind
the choice of edges determined by contemporaneity. If the spread of disease is orderly
and progressive, there will be few edge crossings and any edge crossings will involve
edges that are close in time. Less orderly transmission will result in more crossings
and crossings between edges widely separated in time. Subsequent ﬁgures illustrate

Fraser ﬁr (Figure 10.21) (Benson et al. 2006). Whichever deﬁnition for edges we use,
the two examples look very different (Figures 10.19 and 10.20 compared with Figures
10.21 and 10.22). In the Hevea contemporaneous appearance graph, there is nothing
that looks like orderly spatial spread; there are many crossings and many crossings
between edges of more distant times. In the Fraser ﬁr example, while it does not look
like the orderly “textbook” diagram, there are fewer edge crossings and more of them

disease at time 1, to more cases east and north of the centre as time proceeds. Comparing
the two, it is no surprise that while the Fraser ﬁr mortality is caused by a pathogen that
is infective, Phytophthora, the Hevea necrosis does not seem to be an infectious disease
(Peyrard et al. 2006).

Spatio-temporal graphs of diseased and uninfected individuals can also be used to
detect spatio-temporal clusters in the data, as described in many works, but the issues
related to the non-commensurability of space and time remain, and it is not clear how
graph theory itself can contribute to this endeavour. The deﬁnition of the edges would
have to be carefully chosen to be helpful (see Figure 10.6).
This research topic has been presented as for a stand or plantation of mapped trees
monitored for disease, but a common alternative is records of disease appearance for
spatial cells at larger scales (e.g. ﬁelds or counties or states). The analysis of such data
using spatio-temporal graphs is similar to that for individual stems, with some modiﬁ-
cations necessary to account for the contiguity of adjacent spatial cells in a regular grid
or irregular mosaic.

10.3.7
Disease Spread: Mobile Organisms
This gets complicated, and a simple summary spatio-temporal graph may not be ade-
quate. If the organisms are territorial animals, the territories may be treated as the sta-
tionary objects like sessile organisms and the usual analysis proceeds with only minor
adjustments; Craft et al. (2010) have described the case of Serengeti lions, showing how
the spatial network of territories can provide a simulated contact network, and then a
simulated disease transmission network. The more general answer is that what started
as a spatial graph as the basis for the analysis, must then become a contact history graph.
One application of the time-only graphs described in Chapter 8 was the recording and
analysis of inter-individual contacts, and proximity detectors can be used to track these
through time. In their work on modelling disease spread in cattle, Duncan et al. (2012)
compared empirical (observed) contact networks with simulations based on mass-action
mixing. The recorded networks had more repeated contacts, lower closeness and clus-
tering scores, and greater average path lengths; these graph-theoretical characteristics
predict fewer infected animals and lower risk of disease spread.
The topology of (contact) networks affects disease spread, as would be predicted, and
Shirley and Rushton (2005) found in a modelling exercise that disease spread was fastest
in scale-free graphs and slowest in regular lattices, with random (Erdös-Rényi) graphs
and rewired lattices giving intermediate rates. In general, it is found that node degree and
connectance (triangle completion) have the strongest effects on disease spread (Keeling
1999; Franc 2003, among many others) but “community structure” or modularity also
is important (Salathé & Jones 2010).
Some of the work on disease networks has been focussed on aspatial (or abstracted)
time-only contact networks (see Newman 2010, Chapter 17), but sometimes the spatial
context of those contact networks is of great importance to the dynamics that result
(see Figure 10.23), and including that important spatial context then requires the spatio-
temporal graphs. One challenge is to derive static graphs for the epidemiology network

from the dynamic time-only networks of contacts (Holme 2013). In transferring the
results from aspatial models to spatial ones, an important main effect is through the
degree of a particular node in the graph. One of the best examples of a study of disease
transmission in networks is of lions in the Serengeti, which are territorial and therefore
possibly buffered from disease spread. Craft et al. (2010) compared the territory network
(a spatial graph) with the contact network (behavioural graph) and then a transmission
network (outcome graph), by several measures to determine how “small world” the
networks are. One of the key measures was “efﬁciency,” which is the average of the
reciprocals of all node-to-node distances. It was suspected that nomadic individuals that
move through more than one territory might be important disease vectors. The main
ﬁnding was that the networks were sufﬁciently small world, with short paths and high
efﬁciencies for potential disease transmission, that territoriality did not protect against
disease, and that the epidemiological impact of nomads was slight.
Contacts between mobile individuals are usually key for disease transmission, and
these can be recorded in a temporal aspatial graph. A truly spatio-temporal approach
may seem confusing, but it offers the opportunity to look for spatio-temporal trends or
hot spots of contacts (Figure 10.23) that may result in the spread of the disease. This is
an obvious application for spatio-temporal scan statistics as well as the characteristics
of the associated spatio-temporal graphs.

10.3.8
Metacommunity Dynamics in Real and Virtual Archipelagos
This application may be the most familiar to community ecologists, since it is a tempo-
ral or dynamic extension of many discussions based on well-founded theories of island
biogeography, the concept of metapopulations in fragmented landscapes, and practical
considerations for species and community conservation (Mouquet & Loreau 2002; Lei-
bold 2009; Cerdeira et al. 2010; Ai et al. 2013, among many others).
A simple model begins with the kind of island system described in Chapter 9, with
a spatial graph related to the ease or probability of dispersal between the nodes that
represent the islands. The islands are habitat patches, too, and the edges between nodes
represent potential dispersal of organisms from one patch to another. As with many
such examples, there is a range of spatial graphs that can be used to give the spatial
structure, with a range of spatial neighbour edge densities, and thus average physical
distances and node degrees. The spatial edges may be determined by one of the topo-
logical rules (Chapter 1), by physical structures (such as streams and rivers between
lakes as islands), by functional factors (storm tracks, vector migration routes), or by
similarity measures (e.g. compositional or physiographic similarity). For community
considerations, the effectiveness of any edge between nodes will vary with the species
as well as with time and environmental conditions. The temporal data are catalogues
of species densities associated with each node and their changes through time, based
for example, on periodic censuses. Time is therefore discrete. One goal for creating a
spatio-temporal graph is to evaluate how well species densities can be predicted from
the species on spatial and temporal “neighbours” as well as island size, age and isola-
tion. As with the landscape patch transition example, the density of species s on island
i at time t can be modelled by dependence on the current density of s on neighbouring
islands (usually ﬁrst-order neighbours in the spatial graph, but possibly second or third
order too); on the density of s on i at times t −1, t −2, . . . ; and on past densities on
the same neighbouring nodes. Temporal edges join each island to one or more previous
instances of itself and to preceding instances of some of its spatial neighbours (as in
Figure 10.11). The main exercise is to determine which spatial and temporal neighbours
give the best predictions of species composition and turnover, and species densities
and their changes through time. Spatio-temporal graphs seem to be an ideal method
for this investigation of metacommunities and how spatial structure contributes to their
dynamics because they allow a partitioning of the effects of neighbour nodes and their
.011

characteristics by time and by space. This approach will complement the time-only
studies of trends using long-term data sets such as bird community composition (e.g.
Kampichler et al. 2014), single comparisons based on two observation times (Azeria
2004), stand age-for-time substitution (e.g. Zhao et al. 2013b), or spatial studies based
on patch size and neighbours (e.g. Husté & Boulinier 2011; and references in Chapter
9). One concern is that important effects may result from factors that act over greater dis-
tance or over longer time periods (further back history) than those available or included
in the analysis (see Layeghifard et al. 2015).
Summary
r Observations at discrete time intervals, discrete space created by the islands as habitat
polygons in a background matrix, or continuous space with mapped coordinates
r One layer per time period in a many-layered graph
r Nodes permanent: island or patch locations, but with time-varying species densities
r Edges based on temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal “neighbours” include past self;
edges may also be physical or functional, or determined by similarity
r Measures: rates and conditions for each density transition; effect of graph deﬁnition
of spatio-temporal neighbours, topological or functional
r Comparisons: Similar to spatial and temporal regression analysis of densities; ﬁnding
the best spatio-temporal network for species density predictions; comparing edges
based on function with edges based on similarity. Non-stationarity is a serious con-
cern, especially under climate change
10.3.9
Other Applications
Without as much detail, it is worth describing a few other applications where spatio-
temporal graphs and networks can be helpful in ecology. One such application of spatio-
temporal graphs would be a variant of the last example, the analysis of communities that
are periodically extinguished and then re-establish from nothing. Examples for such
studies of spatio-temporal patterns of metacommunity structure are the pitcher plant
inquiline community (see Kneitel & Miller 2003; Harvey & Miller 1996, among many
others), annually temporary ponds (Wilbur 1997), and the annual intertidal communities
where ice-scour cleans the surface every winter (Keats et al. 1985; Scrosati & Heaven
2007). The appropriate analysis would provide insights on spatial aspects of community
structure and assembly, as immigration and establishment change the graphs of commu-
nity structure. This is very much a case of the evolution of the graph as the community
develops through time. Spatio-temporal graphs are a good approach to understanding
metacommunities in general, and how spatial structure affects their dynamics; the dif-
ference here is that these are communities that start from “zero,” with no opportunity
for ecological memory, so that only the most immediate history can have an effect.
In discussing time-only graphs (Chapter 8) and in the treatment of proximity and
contact as it affects the spread of disease (this chapter), the use of time-only graphs to
track inter-individual proximity or inter-individual contact was described and illustrated.
One form of a spatio-temporal graph is to combine the temporal graph of theses contacts
.011
15:27:45

250
10 Spatio-temporal Graphs
with a spatial map of where the contacts took place, to produce a spatio-temporal graph
that best suits the needs of the application.
Another application of spatio-temporal graphs is in studies of variation in phenolog-
ical sequences: the seasonal timing of events such as the ﬁrst leaf or the ﬁrst ﬂower
on a particular species at a particular location. The topic is of great interest in the cur-
rent context of global climate change and its effects on seasonal events of importance
to conservation efforts. The data consist of several recognizable events that are located
accurately in time, and for individual plants or populations located in space. The events
may or may not have a prescribed order; for example, a second leaf emergence always
occurs after a ﬁrst leaf emergence, but the ﬁrst ﬂower anthesis may occur either before
or after the emergence of the seventh leaf. The questions of interest concern the rela-
tionships among the records at different locations, and trends within and among records.
The sites are permanent or persistent nodes with locations. Spatial edges can be based
on any rule for a neighbour network, but other inter-site edges are possible. For example,
similar dates for equivalent events (ﬁrst leaf, ﬁrst ﬂower, second ﬂower and so on) may
determine an edge between two sites or common features of the records at two sites.
This application to phenology is similar to spatio-temporal graph analysis of time-point
events over an array of sites, such as ﬁre scars on trees, or of continuous records over a
spatial array of sites, for example meteorological records, pollen sequences, or meteo-
rological records reconstructed (postdicted) from pollen sequences.
There are more ecological examples of studies of the development or evolution of
structural spatial graphs such as the developing structure of foraging trails created by
ants (see Buhl et al. 2009). Kost et al. (2005) have reported on the foraging trails of
leaf cutter ants (Atta sp.) in the New World (Brazil, French Guiana and Panama); these
trail systems evolve through time in the short term, with ephemeral foraging trails being
established and abandoned as branches of longer-lasting trunk trails, but with the char-
acteristics of the systems changing as colonies mature with larger and more complex
trail systems that exploit a broader range of leaf sources. The authors used a combina-
tion of fractal analysis and circular and conventional statistics, but the trails are rooted
trees (the ant nest is the root from which the sub-trees emerge), and graph-theoretic
measures such as graph diameter and branch order would help evaluate the dynamics of
these trail networks.
Also in the domain of physical structures is a recent example that uses spatio-
temporal graphs to model marine dunes under the English Channel (Thibaud et al.
2013). The representation of the physical structure and its movement with time illus-
trates an approach to spatio-temporal analysis that should have many applications in the
general ﬁeld of environmental science.
The last example is not from the mainstream of ecological literature, but it serves as a
good model of studies that could be carried out on populations in the ecological context.
This is a study of spatio-temporal patterns of human migration worldwide (Davis et al.
2013) based on ﬁve observation periods (by decade 1960 to 2000). The network nodes
are countries and the edges are directed and weighted, being the number of migrants
from country i living in country j (there is no edge if the number is 0). They examined
a number of network measures: node degree, nearest neighbour degree, connectance,
.011

transitivity (clustering coefﬁcient), and average path length (geodesic). Connectance
and transitivity increased linearly with year as average path length declined, and the
degree distribution shifted upward. All these are consistent with the “small world” char-
acteristic for this migration network. The authors go on to discuss some of the details
of the patterns in the network, such as groups of countries that preferentially interact,
forming migration communities (modularity considered informally) related to histori-
cal, cultural, and economic factors (Davis et al. 2013).
10.4
Concluding Comments
Compared to the time-only graphs of Chapter 8 and the spatial graphs of Chapter 9,
networks with both time and space have greatly increased range for the ecological phe-
nomena that can be included for the range of treatments that can be accommodated.
Ecologists are very familiar with spatio-temporal data sets and have large numbers
of them at their disposal for summary, analysis and interpretation. Depending on the
purpose or need, one or other of the dimensions may be dropped from subsequent treat-
ment, and often both are ignored. This is despite the fact that determining causation is
seen as the “holy grail” of science and that goal requires keeping track of “when,” and
keeping track of “where” for that context (“no History without Geography”; Cressie &
Wikle 2011, Chapter 1). The use of spatio-temporal graphs in ecological applications
has, so far, been relatively rare. One reason is that, while we like graphs for depicting
and analyzing data in part because they are easy to comprehend, once they include the
dimensions of space and time they can quickly become complicated, and more so as
the size of the data set increases. The difﬁculty lies not in handling, drawing or ana-
lyzing the data, it seems to be at the interpretation stage (i.e. the human, not hardware
or software) when it comes to large data sets (Compieta et al. 2007). One could argue
that adding lines (the graph’s edges) to a visualization of the data, when correctly cho-
sen, can clarify the structure by “telling a story” about its contents. On the other hand,
some examples that might be treated as spatio-temporal graphs may be more easily sum-
marized as change in spatial characteristics, particularly if there are only two or three
observation times (e.g. before and after some event). The other reason that these data
sets may not be portrayed and analyzed explicitly as spatio-temporal graphs or networks
is that some of the big environmental data sets are derived from observations on a spatial
grid taken at regular time intervals, so that the spatio-temporal lattice can be understood
rather than being made explicit; the edges are not really necessary to understand the
relationships among the observations (see e.g. Figure 5.1, 5.23, 7.3, or 9.23 in Cressie
& Wikle 2011). Last, however, is the fact that these techniques are relatively new and
relatively unfamiliar, and it may take some time, as well as a growing body of good
examples, for these methods to become comfortable or obvious choices for ecological
research.

Graph Structure and System
Function: Graphlet Methods
Introduction
Ecological networks are dynamic. Not only do the nodes change their characteristics
and existing edges change in strength or capacity, but elements can appear or disappear.
In predation, if one prey species becomes rare, the predator may respond by switch-
ing to another prey species, removing one edge from the food web graph and adding
one. There is interplay between the states of nodes and edges and the topology of the
network; networks with such reciprocal interactions are called adaptive networks (Do
& Gross 2012). For dynamic interactions among structural units, the behaviour of the
whole system will depend both on its global structure and on very local topology of
functional connections (edges) between structural units (nodes). In adaptive networks,
synchronization of cycles is an emergent property of interest (think of population out-
breaks in insects or small mammals; e.g. Bjørnstadt et al. 1999, among many others),
and it is affected by both global topological measures and aspects of very local con-
ﬁguration (Do & Gross 2012). Graph theory measures that are importance to synchro-
nization include clustering coefﬁcients, graph diameters, the distributions of the node
degrees, and edge weights or capacities. The structural characteristics reﬂect how the
whole might have been generated, and they determine how the entire system functions.
There is a difference between changes to the topology, through the loss or gain of nodes
and edges, and dynamic changes to the characteristics and weights of the nodes and
edges while they persist. One critical effect is how these characteristics affect the sys-
tem’s resilience or robustness (Estrada 2006; Alenazi & Sterbenz 2015; see Newman
2010, Chapter 18).
Ecological interactions between species vary in space and time (Poisot et al. 2015).
There is temporal turnover even when the species are continuously present, for example
in pollination interactions (Petanidou et al. 2008), and the interaction strength varies
with season and time of day, as measured by the proportion of events (Bascompte &
Jordano 2014). Similar variations are found in trophic, competition and other interac-
tion networks. In food webs, the same set of species can have variable network struc-
ture with different factors across space and time (McCann 2012). The regional list of
species together with all possible interactions can be thought of as a meta-web (parallel
to terms such as metapopulation and metacommunity; see Dunne 2006), as if all taxa co-
occurred at one site. Then, any observed food web can be considered as one realization
of the possibilities in the meta-web. If there are several sites with different realizations,

Figure 11.1 Graph-of-bipartite-graphs: pollination mutualisms in patches. The graph with patches
as nodes is a spatial graph. The oval’s size represents patch area; the thickness of the spatial
edges indicates species movement rates. The graphs of plants and pollinators are ecological
graphs with edges representing species’ mutualistic interactions. Based on Hagen et al. (2012,
Figure 20).
the networks at the sites and the spatial graph of the sites’ locations form a graph-of-
graphs (see Hagen et al. 2012, Figures 16–18). In many applications of the meta-web
concept, the interactions that are counted as “possible” for its construction may be lim-
ited by mismatches in habitat, water depth, season and so on, which create “forbidden
links” (cf. Bascompte & Jordano 2014). For any kind of interaction network, therefore,
speciﬁc local instances are realizations of a meta-network which includes all possibil-
ities, removing forbidden links, even as they change through time and space. Changes
can take the form of the gain or loss of species (the nodes) due to local extinctions and
recolonization from linked patches (see Hagen et al. 2012, Figure 20; a graph-of-graphs
simpliﬁed in Figure 11.1), or the gain or loss of edges that represent their interactions.
Both need to be included in evaluating changes or the similarities between realizations
(Poisot et al. 2012; Carstensen et al. 2014). Changes in network structure or function
can be caused by forces internal to the system as its elements interact or by external fac-
tors. For example, in networks of species replacements in successional vegetation, we
can ask how much of the change can be attributed to the species associations within the
vegetation, and how much to external forces (cf. Alacántra & Rey 2014). In their useful
commentary on meta-networks and the interplay of spatial graphs (physical structure)
and ecological graphs (species interactions as function), Hagen et al. (2012) focus on
fragmentation (mainly anthropogenic), but their comments can apply to any system of

It is a truism that “Form follows function,” but also that “Function follows form”; in
ecological networks, the question is how both aspects affect each other and what can be
learned about each from knowledge of the other. The purpose in using graph theory to

study dynamic ecological networks is to determine the relationship between form and
function, pattern and process or structure and dynamics. The focus is not the technical
ﬁeld of dynamic network analysis, which is a whole book on its own (see Carley 2003;
Kocarev & Vattay 2010), but it is more closely related to adaptive network models (see
Do & Gross 2012). As suggested, the interplay between the two aspects of the network,
topology and states, can be driven by the system itself, which is then essentially self-
organization (Figure 11.2), or it is affected by external factors and their trends, such as
climate change (Figure 11.3; see Woodward et al. 2010), or by other interaction net-
works (Figure 11.4). The challenge for ecologists is to determine how much and under
what circumstances an understanding of function (network dynamics) can be derived
from observed form (network topology). The question is “How can methods based on
graph theory help ecologists understand the dynamic functioning of ecological systems
from knowledge of their structure?”
As an example, the elements of a mycorrhizal network develop in response to its
functional needs and the environment it encounters, but the functions can be modiﬁed
or rebalanced according to the circumstances (Simard et al. 2012). One can distinguish
between the dynamics of networks, which are the changes in network topology and

any rules that govern those changes, and the dynamics on networks, which are the
changes in the properties of the network nodes within constant network topology (see
Ganguly et al. 2009). The study of adaptive networks looks at both aspects together
and their mutual feedback (Gross & Blasius 2008, their Figure 1 redrawn as Figure

even as the nodes or the edges between nodes turn over or change (see state transi-

co-evolving networks (states and topology) and described how they can achieve consis-
tent structure of modules as a dynamic equilibrium in which the identity and composi-
tion of the modules change.
To introduce a dangerous analogy, consider a railway. (The similarity between the
adaptive networks of biological systems and those of railways or roads has been noted
elsewhere; see Gross & Blasius 2008; Tero et al. 2010.) A railway is a network that
can be represented by a graph with the tracks being the edges, and nodes representing
junctions, switches, stations, waypoints or any other stationary ﬁxed features. The ﬁrst
function of the network is to support the movement of machines and cargo along the
tracks, and those dynamics can be quantiﬁed by the rates and amounts of materials
moved by the trains over each section of track and in each direction (that’s the dynamics
on the network). The state of the network is deﬁned by the states of the nodes and
edges: most simply “what is where” on the tracks. The second function of machines
on the railway is the upkeep or modiﬁcation of the rail system itself. The locations
of tracks at any point in time have been determined by the history of opportunity and
need, and by the energetics and cost of the system. However, the functions of the train
system itself (“what needs to be where”) will lead to changes in the tracks, and the
railway’s machines can modify, rebuild, reroute, or otherwise change the network (new
lines, new switches, new grades, . . . ). Therefore, while the tracks (structure) determine
or constrain the function of the machines that use them (the dynamics on the network);
the functioning machines can also change the structure, and accumulated changes over
time are the dynamics of (not on) the network. External forces and the changes they
cause may also lead to the need for changes in the system. A more ecological analogy
would be a meandering river, in which stream ﬂow modiﬁes the spatial characteristics
of the river, in turn affecting stream ﬂow.
One last thought from this railway example, and here the analogy becomes dangerous
(but why I chose it), is that sometimes the function of network components can be
inferred from their structure. You don’t need to see the round-house turntable in action to
know what it does, based on its structure. Similarly, the difference between asymmetric
switches with tapered moving rails and rectilinear rail crossing points, and between
how those track elements affect train movement, are also obvious from their shape and
structure . . . but, you do need to know something about trains before this understanding
of function from form will work. We might make the same argument for ecological
phenomena, particularly for spatial graphs, where the functional difference for dispersal
between a string of “stepping-stone” patches and compact and isolated clusters may
be obvious (see Saura et al. 2014). McIntire and Fajardo (2009), for example, have
argued that in some cases process can be deduced given a deﬁned a priori hypothesis,
ecological knowledge, and precise spatial (or possibly temporal) analysis. One of the
six examples they cite concerns the invasion of exotic trees (Acer platanoides) based
on the work by Fang (2005) in which a comparison of the tree-size versus distance
from invasion origin graphs for exotic versus native permits a distinction between active
invasion and native suppression. This is similar to a comparison of the spatial patterns
of invasion from an advancing edge for “frontal advance” versus “saltation” (cf. Little
& Dale 1999). Ecologists are usually more comfortable in drawing conclusions about
.012

network topology from observed functional dynamics, most often in a spatial context
(see Gilarranz et al. 2015), although not always (see Albert et al. 2013). The analogy
is that there is something to be learned about the constraints on functional dynamics
from the topology of the network at a local scale. Again, understanding function from
observing form requires additional knowledge.
Inferring process from pattern is difﬁcult, but as one success in a very different
endeavour, consider the work of Mnih et al. (2013, 2015) on “deep reinforcement learn-
ing,” which looks at the ability of machine learning to “reverse engineer” a computer
game and determine its underlying rules from observing it being played. This work pro-
duced the ﬁrst model to learn “control policies” from “high-dimensional sensory input”;
in essence, this was a test of artiﬁcial intelligence learning the rules of old Atari games
based only on the pixels of the screen and the score generated by the game. The “agent”
was able to achieve the same level of performance as professional human games testers
across a range of 49 different games. Whether or not this achievement is true artiﬁcial
intelligence, it demonstrates the algorithmic ability to extract the rules of process from
observed patterns, which is clearly important to this discussion.
Ecologists are wary of deducing function from form, and the worry applies also to
interaction networks where the correlations between network metrics and ecological
system processes may be sampling effects (Ulrich 2009). There is, however, much to be
learned by looking at network structure carefully and in detail to help understand net-
work dynamics. A realistic parallel to predicting dynamics from topology and structure
in ecology is the current research on protein interaction networks. In that work, com-
bining knowledge of the topology and physical shape of a protein with knowledge of
its place and neighbours in the interaction network, together with the topology of that
network itself, seems to allow good predictions of the protein’s function and its role in
the network (see Pržulj et al. 2004; Winterbach et al. 2013; Peterson et al. 2012; Pržulj
2010). The search for understanding ecological function based on combined knowledge
of the system structure and of the organisms themselves does not seem so far-fetched,
given the successes in the parallel molecular biology endeavour. Those studies provide
suggestions on how ecologists can proceed, and they use methods based on small sub-
graphs called graphlets, which are the subject of this chapter.
11.1
Graphs for Structure and Dynamics in Ecological Systems
The “structure” here is the graph and its topology, the nodes and node pairs joined by
edges, that determine the dynamics of the interaction network in its current conﬁgu-
ration. Network functions include the ﬂow of energy, the cycling of elements, effects
on population densities (whether they grow or decline, and thus affecting selection and
evolution), and effects on community composition. In animal populations, these effects
may also be found through the functioning of social networks of afﬁnities (Chapter 5)
in unexpected ways (Kurvers et al. 2014). In plant populations, it has been shown that
the production of offspring in the short-lived monocarpic herb Erysimum mediohispan-
icum (Brassicaceae) could be related to characteristics of the mutualistic pollination

network: nestedness, connectivity and clustering (Gómez et al. 2011). The network
changes to be considered include local extinction (of a node); the loss of an interac-
tion (an edge), perhaps due to behavioural switching, seasonal cycles and phenology; or
life-history stage differences. For example, in a host-parasite network of small mammals
and their ectoparasites, large temporal variation in persistent host species can change
their functional roles, and the function of parasites with strong negative effects on hosts
can facilitate the general spread of parasites (Pilosof et al. 2013). In any system, some
of these changes are brought about or inhibited or enhanced by interactions with other
elements in a broader network, including competitors, predators, parasites and so forth.
Real understanding of all-species interaction networks should include the full range of
inter-speciﬁc links (Montoya et al. 2006). If the sum-of-all-paths approach to complex
networks is required when we are not so inclusive, we need to know the “cost” of what
is left out when only one kind of interaction is considered. If the goal is to integrate
structure and dynamics through their reciprocal effects, we should endeavour to include
parts of the structure of which the importance is not yet known, until we know what
parts can be safely left out.
Studying the network topology, just nodes and edges, at one moment in time is “easy”
in comparison with quantifying all the pairwise interactions to be included in a large (n
select 2) array of differential equations to describe the dynamics of each pair. Species
interaction networks are expected to be dynamic themselves, changing through time in
response to the forces of their own internal functional dynamics or in response to forces
that are truly external, such as climate change. What is needed is a “common language”
of analysis that will work for a range of interactions considered together and in systems
that are inﬂuenced by environmental cycles and long-term trends.
Whichever set of these complications we include or exclude, the central puzzle is the
relationship between graph structure (topology) and network dynamics (function and
change through time). The challenge is to use the accessible knowledge of local struc-
ture (think of the distribution of nodes’ degrees) to make inferences about the global
characteristics of the network (think of small world vs scale free) and thus about its
function and its evolution through time, past and future. Studies of adaptive networks
suggest that they are capable of robust self-organization of their topology based on local
rules and feedback to local dynamics of the topology (Gross and Blasius 2008). If this
can be pursued for important ecological networks, this is obviously something ecolo-
gists should DO in applying graph theory approaches to ecological questions. The rest
of this chapter provides an introduction to a method that does exactly that, and then a
discussion of the implications for research on ecological systems.
Studies of synchronization of cyclic phenomena (technically “phase oscillators”),
which occur in many natural phenomena including population cycles of small mam-
mals, insects and birds (Bjørnstadt et al. 1999; Liebhold et al. 2004; Mortelliti et al.
2015, among many others), provide insights into the relationship between structure and
function in dynamic networks. In particular, work by Do and colleagues (see Do &
Gross 2012) demonstrated that the propensity to synchronization in such networks is
related to the topology of small multi-node subgraphs within them. They used a new
graph-based notation by which the algebraic stability conditions can be mapped onto
.012
15:27:46

11.2 Graph Characteristics and Methods Based on Graphlets

topological stability criteria. As in most ecological examples, the focus of the discus-
sion of synchronization is on stability, whereby small perturbations are not magniﬁed
and trajectories that are close to the system’s steady state remain close. Their work
points to an approach based on graphlets, which are small but multi-node subgraphs, to
be described next.
11.2
Graph Characteristics and Methods Based on Graphlets
In ecological studies using graphs or networks, the most familiar measures of structure
are related either to the whole graph (e.g. connectance or diameter) or to individual
nodes (e.g. degree or centrality), but characteristics based on small subgraphs should
also be considered, particularly if these can indicate the relationship between structure
and function and the likely local roles of individual nodes. Graphlets are small con-
nected subgraphs, of two, three, four or ﬁve nodes, which can be enumerated as local
structures of a larger interaction graph. These are good candidates as the basis for study-
ing the relationship between network topology and dynamics, aided by a focus on the
frequency of different graphlets and on the frequency of nodes at particular locations in
the graphlets.
Remember that the degree of a network node is an indicator of the network’s robust-
ness to its loss or removal, based in part on the discussion of inference based on random
walks on the graph (the argument for degree centrality, see Chapter 9). The loss of ran-
dom nodes usually has little impact, but the loss of the most highly connected nodes
leads to instability (Montoya et al. 2006; Solé & Montoya 2001). These observations
lead to questions such as: Do the degrees of ﬁrst neighbours affect robustness and vul-
nerability? How does nestedness or other forms of asymmetry affect robustness? Are
these responses the same for different interactions or opposite for mutualisms versus
antagonisms?
The key to investigating such questions lies in methods based on graphlets, which
both generalize the concept of a node’s degree and extend the identiﬁcation of com-
mon motifs in networks. Motifs are identiﬁable small subgraphs of networks, and net-
works from different systems have different characteristically common motifs (Milo
et al. 2002). For example, networks of genetic transcription have large numbers of
the motifs called “feed-forward loop” and “bi-fan,” whereas ecological trophic net-
works commonly have those called “3-chain” and “bi-parallel” (Figure 11.6), with the
feed-forward loop being unexpectedly rare. Graphlets can go beyond identifying sub-
graph shapes by looking also at the positions of nodes within the subgraphs, as will be
described, but with the understanding that the node’s position in the system network can
indicate something about its functional role in the system.
The material that follows is based on the work of Pržulj and co-workers described in a
series of papers (Pržulj 2007; Milenkovic & Pržulj 2008; Yaveroglu et al. 2014), and it is
the last paper of that series that promises most for ecological networks and the dynamic
interplay between structure and function. This is somewhat complicated, however, and
it will take some background to build up to the most interesting result.

A graphlet is an induced connected subgraph of an undirected graph with three, four
or ﬁve nodes. Induced just means that all edges of the nodes’ subset that are in the
original graph must be included in the graphlet; a motif, on the other hand, can be a
partial subgraph. Graphlets can be used as indicators of local structure and by counting
the different graphlets to determine their frequencies. These frequencies often provide
signiﬁcant information about local network structure (Ahmed et al. 2015) and the ﬁne
structure of two networks can be compared using their graphlet relative frequencies.
Ahmed et al. used this approach to evaluate the Facebook social network of California
universities, and found that Caltech was considerably different from all the others (their
Figure 6) probably because of their unique housing arrangements for undergraduate
students (Ahmed et al. 2015). This analysis treats graphlets as motifs, but there is more
that can be done with them.
Another method is to classify every node according to the graphlets in which it occurs
(often many) and its positions in those graphlets where distinguishable, because posi-
tion may suggest functional role. Nodes that are distinguishable by position within a
single graphlet belong to different automorphism “orbits”; nodes that are topologically
indistinguishable within a single graphlet belong to the same orbit. Starting with two
nodes and a single edge joining them as a “level 0” graphlet, the nodes are equivalent
and both are labelled as “orbit 0,” as in Figure 11.7a. For any node in any graph, the
number of such graphlets in which the node occurs is its degree. For n = 3, there are two
graphlets; the ﬁrst is graphlet 1, a two-edge chain with two indistinguishable end-nodes
(orbit 1) and a central node between them (orbit 2). The second three-node graphlet is
a triangle with all nodes equivalent (orbit 3, see Figure 11.7a). For n = 4, there are six
graphlets, giving orbits 4 to 14 (Figure 11.7b); n = 5 provides another 21 graphlets with
orbits 15 to 72 (see Pržulj 2007). This gives, in total, for n = 2, 3, 4, and 5, graphlets
0 to 29 and distinguishable orbits 0, 1, 2, . . . , 72. Any graph can then be characterized
by counts of the graphlets and by counts of the nodes’ orbits that it contains as induced
subgraphs, as illustrated in Figure 11.7c.
The local topology of any node can be summarized by the graphlets in which it occurs
and its positions within them, as indicated by its orbits. For example, the end node in
graphlet 9, which deﬁnes orbit 15, is also in orbits 0, 1 and 4 because of its end position

in graphlets 0, 1 and 3 (see Figure 11.8). Any node can therefore be characterized by
a list of its orbits, or by a 73-place vector of 1s and 0s indicating its orbits, known as
the node’s “signature.” This is the graphlet degree signature (GDS) or graphlet degree
vector. The signatures of any two nodes can be compared and clusters of nodes cre-
ated based on node similarities (Milenkovic & Pržulj 2008). It is also possible to look
at the combined signatures of all nodes belonging to the same orbit: the number of
nodes of each orbit attached to nodes of any given orbit, giving 73 separate 73-place
signatures.

Figure 11.8 Non-independence among graphlets. Graphlet 9 and its node in orbit 15 counts also
as touching orbits 0, 1 and 4.
To characterize the structure of an entire graph, the graphlet signatures of all its nodes
can be combined in a plot of the orbits’ relative frequencies. Figure 11.9 illustrates this
approach plotting the frequencies of the orbits for the smaller graphlets (up to n = 4,
so orbits 0 to 14) for two very similar networks (based loosely on Milenkovic & Prž-
ulj 2008, Figure 2, the yeast proteins SMD1 and SMD2). The orbits, especially when
the larger graphlets (n = 5) are included, are not independent, as Figure 11.8 illustrates,
showing that a node of orbit 15 necessarily includes orbits 0, 1 and 4 as well. This redun-
dancy in the information provided by the orbit frequencies is something to be accounted
for. The original suggestion by Milenkovic and Pržulj (2008) was to assign each orbit
a score that is the number of orbits it includes and then to derive a weight from these
scores to be used to account for the lack of independence in the relative frequencies of
node orbits in an entire graph. This weighting allows a direct orbit-by-orbit comparison
of the graphlet signatures of two graphs, or an overall measure of difference or simi-
larity, as illustrated in the work cited. These degree vectors and signature similarities
can be used to tie topological or structural similarity to predictions about function in
systems such as protein-protein interactions (Milenkovic & Pržulj 2008). A straightfor-
ward variant of this approach is to use the distributions of the graphlet degrees (GDD)
to measure the similarity or agreement of two networks (Pržulj 2007).
More recent work (Yaveroglu et al. 2014) provides an appealing reﬁnement. Given the
lack of independence among the graphlet orbits, linear equations were used to reduce
the 73 orbits of the 2-to-5-node graphlets to 56 that were non-redundant, and to reduce
the 15 orbits of the 2-to-4 node graphlets to 11. Any correlations that remain among the
reduced list of orbits reﬂect the structure of the network itself. It turns out that the 11
based on the smaller graphlets provide real advantages, and these are used for any graph
to derive an 11 × 11 graphlet correlation matrix (GCM) from the correlations between
the elements of the graphlet degree vector. These correlations can be interpreted to

reveal the structural characteristics of any network graph of any size. For any two graphs,
the Euclidean distance between the corresponding entries of the two matrices gives the
graphlet correlation distance (GCD-11). This GCD-11 was found to be a very good
measure for comparing the structure of graphs, based on extensive testing by Yaveroglu
et al. (2014); it is fast to compute, responsive the graphs’ characteristics, and robust to
noise in the data or random losses.
Why am I telling you all this? . . . and in such detail? The reason lies in one example
used in the Yaveroglu paper, which describes the changing structure of the world trad-
ing network from 1962 to 2010. The nodes of the network are countries, and the edges
represent the volume of trade between pairs of countries in any given year. Clearly,
this is an adaptive network, and somewhat self-organizing, in which topology and ﬂow
interact and “co-evolve” with time. The authors describe some of the richness of detail
that can be determined by the graphlet-based method about the structure and function
of this network, and how those have changed through the 48 years. Furthermore, the
relationship between a nodes orbit signature and its other characteristics (here for exam-
ple, population, GDP, and employment level) can be determined from the correlations
in a Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), allowing interpretation of the node’s
structural role with those measured characteristics. The overall process of analysis is a
complex series of steps, and the determination of those correlations is a crucial step. For
example, the product of population and GDP is positively associated with the hubs of
cross- shaped graphlets, whereas measures related to transactions in goods, services and

income are negatively correlated with orbits that are leaf nodes in graphlets (“BCA” in
Figure 4b of Yaveroglu et al. 2014). Such correlations allow generalizations about the
roles of nodes in the network: which are in tight trading clusters, which act as bro-
kers between less connected pairs, and which are peripheral in the network. Similar
categories, of clusters, connecting nodes and peripheral elements, are to be expected
in applications of this analysis to other systems such as trophic networks. Repeated
observation allows an assessment of how the different roles change through time and,
perhaps, what drives those changes.
One feature of the world trade network example is that the orbits fall into two groups:
4, 6 and 9, reﬂecting peripheral structures and the rest (0, 2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11) representing
nodes in mediator or “broker” positions. Therefore, the authors used the bigger set of
orbits to calculate “peripheral” versus “broker” scores for individual nodes, here rep-
resenting trading countries, which can be followed through time as their roles in world
trade changed through time, with higher broker scores being indicative of increasing
economic success and inﬂuence. For example, there is a marked increase in China’s
“broker” score starting about the year 2000, and a steady decline in Britain’s through-
out the time period; another detail is the obvious increases in the peripheral scores of
countries that joined the EU around the time of its formation. In addition, the authors
show the correlation between landmark changes in crude oil prices and changes in the
structure of the trade network, and correlations between countries’ economic attributes
and the graphlet degrees derived by this approach. This is rich stuff indeed!
Reading the material, I kept thinking how revealing this method could be for inves-
tigating the changing structure and function of complex ecological systems, and the
relationship between the two aspects of these systems. Noting changes to the network
graph is not enough; we could get lost in the detail of one node replacing another that is
essentially equivalent, or an edge forming or disappearing or substituting for a similar
edge, without affecting the important features of the graph structure or the fundamental
characteristics of the network function. We need to be able to distinguish between trivial
modiﬁcations and those that are more substantial. That’s what the graphlet counts do;
they show which changes in the structure are the major ones, those that will be corre-
lated with the evolution of the network’s dynamics. This feature can be especially useful
where we want to include many kinds of ecological interactions, as perhaps we must,
to get as full an understanding as possible of the interplay of topology and function.
Often, we will need to also include network responses (form and function) to external
forces such as climate change (see Woodward et al. 2010). After all, the world trade
network, the subject of that rich example, includes and aggregates interactions that are
the same as competition, predation, and various forms of mutualism, and it responds to
long-term trends as well as cycles. Here the graph theory approach to network analysis
of ecological systems will really pay off . . . and, yes, this method is implemented in R
(Yaveroglu et al. 2015).
Further advances in graphlets for dynamic networks are based on directed graphlets
for digraphs (Sarajli´c et al. 2016; Trpevski et al. 2016). Where only one edge is allowed
per pair of nodes (i.e. no reciprocal pairs of edges), n = 2, 3 and 4, provide 39 directed
graphlets and 128 directed orbits (Figure 11.10). This seems to be especially important

gent processes (e.g. graphlets d11 and d12 compared to d10 and d13 in Figure 11.11).
Trpevski et al. (2016) used a modiﬁed approach for brain effective connectivity net-
works in which edges could be either unidirectional or reciprocal, and directional edges
have a sign indicating inhibitory or excitatory. (In the Sarajli´c approach reciprocal edges
are treated by counting two graphlets, one for each direction, as in their Figure 1c.) They
also focussed on the graphlets with n = 3: with two edges forming a “wedge” or with
three edges forming a triangle. They found that the signature vectors were dominant the
excitatory effective brain networks, and that the excitatory networks shoed strong causal
patterns than the inhibitory ones.
For either set of digraph graphlets, the most proﬁtable applications seem to be cor-
relational: the graphlet correlation matrix (Trpevski et al. 2016), and the correlation of
graphlet degrees with other node attributes determined by Canonical Correspondence
Analysis (CCA; Yaveroglu et al. 2014; Sarajli´c et al. 2016). Applications to ecologi-
cal networks seem promising; Sarajli´c et al. (2016) have suggested that these methods
allow sophisticated analysis and interpretation of topology for directed networks from
any area of science. The potential for analyzing ecological networks using correlation
measures for directed graphlets seems to be both obvious and enormous.

This is certainly one smart thing ecologists can do in applying graph theory to the
systems we study. Because there is such a range of ways to use graphlets, and more
certain to follow, Table 11.1 provides a summary of current graphlets-based methods.
The graphlet approaches look very promising for understanding ecological networks,
given the clear parallel with the protein interaction networks that are intensively studied.
Those networks seem to have been the inspiration for the graphlet research, because the
doctoral theses of both Dr Pržulj and Dr Milenkovic were based on them (Pržulj 2005;
Milenkovic 2008), and if the parallel between the two kinds of networks is substantial,
the method should transfer to good effect. The exploration of graphlet methodology
and application is, however, far from over. There are already speciﬁc applications for
temporal networks (Hulovatyy et al. 2015), and the promise for spatial networks seems
great; think of working out structure and function relationships in mycorrhizal systems
(see Simard et al. 2012; Southworth et al. 2005).
Other characteristics of these networks may be informative on the relationship
between structure and function. The existence of modular structure seems to affect
function and stability (see Melián et al. 2009). Does the size of the modules or their
position in the network affect their effectiveness as stabilizers or destabilizers? What
is the interaction between modular structure and other characteristics? Does modu-
larity “fall out” from a graphlet analysis? Probably yes, based on GDS node cluster-
ing in Milenkovic and Pržulj (2008) and the world trade example in Yaveroglu et al.
(2014).
Strongly connected components seem to be important structural elements for the
functioning of marine trophic networks. Do they have a general and predictable effect on
persistence and robustness? What is the effect of compartments on stability or robust-
ness in these networks? In particular, do strongly connected components work in the
graphlet context to tell us something important about stability of the system? In gen-
eral, how can we use the graphlets, which indicate function based on topology to provide
deﬁnitive evaluation of overall stability?

C, D, but the total ﬂow includes all possible paths, e.g. A, E, F, C, J, D . . . and perhaps even all

This endeavour is the equivalent of the complete trophic impact approach to food
webs, or of the sum-of-all-paths view of spatial graphs describing genetic or informa-
tion ﬂow. Figure 11.12 gives an artiﬁcial example, but illustrates that the total ﬂow
between two nodes in a graph of function is due not just to the path of least resistance
(A, B, C, D), but to all possible paths, including those that are less direct. Similarly, the
interactions of a plant and its pollinator are not an isolated relationship; they take place
in the context of the competitors of both plant and pollinator, the pollinator’s parasitoids
and predators, the plant’s herbivores and their predators, omnivores, and so on (Figure

those two for some deﬁned set of species and their interactions (e.g. nectar-producing
plants and their pollinators), there is also a need to integrate the various kinds of inter-
actions that can be found within the broader ecological network. This is an ambitious
assignment, and one that may end up with many questions and few ﬁrm answers, and a
greater reliance on answers based on models rather than experimental data, but that’s a
start.
The dynamics of these networks are two-fold: ﬁrst, the function of the network as it
exists; second, the changes in the network itself as it develops or evolves. The graph-
theoretical properties of the network, its topology, determine the former and affect the
latter; but equally, function and ongoing development affect changes in structural char-
acteristics (Figure 11.3). For ecologists, the primary concern in studying these networks
is to predict their stability or persistence in the context of change, whether the change
is essentially internal to the network perhaps driven by (co-)evolution, or whether it is
driven by external forces such as anthropogenic fragmentation or climate change (Figure
11.4; see cite Woodward et al. 2010). The most direct topological change to consider is
the loss or addition of a node in the network (usually a species) or the loss or addition of
a single edge (one pairwise interaction). Less obvious changes, such as variation in rates
of predation, pollen transfer or frugivory, may be equally important for network modiﬁ-
cation (particularly for “keystone species” or “keystone links,” as discussed in Chapter
4), although perhaps more difﬁcult to assess. This basic argument for this chapter how-
ever, is that any attempt to understand the interplay between network structure and its
functional dynamics (and how those change each other through time) cannot be limited
only to a single kind of inter-speciﬁc interaction.
There is good reason to be optimistic that graphlet approaches can help with under-
standing function based on topology, and the world trade example provides a good
almost-ecological example of how that can work. The difﬁculty is that in an inclu-
sive ecological system, the edges represent interactions that are fundamentally differ-
ent from each other (Figure 11.13), whereas the world trade network has edges that are
essentially the same. The same graphlet spectrum summarizing the intimate topology
of the system for our interpretation will have different functional implications depend-
ing on the interactions encoded by the edges. This will be true whether the edges all
represent the same relationship (Figure 11.14, ﬁrst three panels), or several different
relationships, as in our “all interactions” version (Figure 11.13) or the last panel of
Figure 11.14. The complexity is similar to the challenges experienced at the molecular
level with genes, proteins, metabolites and pharmaceuticals all interacting in differ-
ent ways both within and between categories. To return to our dangerous analogy of a
railway, true ecological systems move and transform information and energy, and are
like having nodes of stations, yards and waypoints interlinked not just by a single rail
carrier, but by competing railway companies, by canals and by trucks on roads; com-
plemented by telephone, radio and Internet; and complicated by weather, disasters and
saboteurs. There is no doubt that all interactions are important, but being all-inclusive
will make the interpretation of ecological structure and function more difﬁcult to work
out.

Figure 11.14 Graphlet 6 and its three-node orbits (9, 10, 11) contribute to the structural spectrum
of a larger network. The same spectrum of structures will have different functional implications
depending on the interactions coded by the edges.
On the other hand, I may be exaggerating the complexity of ecological systems com-
pared to the world trade network model, and one could suggest that in that example,
interactions among subunits that are similar to competition, predation, sabotage and
collaboration are all actually present in the data, but summarized by the aggregated
measures that are used. Similarly, because local topology and the positions of nodes
in commonly occurring small subgraphs, have already provided insight into how struc-
ture affects functional dynamics, including more kinds of interactions in the networks
analyzed should give more insight into this interaction. This area of research is obvi-
ously very complex, with hard problems to be solved, but recent progress provides an
indication of how this may proceed.
11.3
Concluding Comments
The networks studied in ecology change in time and in space, with changes in both the
nodes (often their states) and the edges (where they occur and their functional weights).
The changes may be caused by external forces, interactions with other kinds of ecolog-
ical networks, or by the reciprocal changes internal to the network under scrutiny; that
is the relationship between graph structure and system dynamics.
The main theme is the “co-evolutionary” relationship between form and function,
topology and dynamics or pattern and process, using graph theory to characterize the
form of the ecological network and determining how that topology affects the dynamics
and how the functioning of the network in turn affects its structure. The analogies of a
railway, road, meandering river, or molecular interaction networks (like protein-protein)
indicate what we already know: that system topology alone is probably not enough to
teach us about the relationship with dynamics, but it is required, and can be combined
with other information (about railways, rivers, or biological molecules) to provide that
insight. With sufﬁcient understanding of the system, the positions of network nodes in

the whole graph or in its characteristic graphlets can indicate their roles in system func-
tion, which is the goal of this form of analysis. Graphlet-based methods are a promising
approach to this, based on graphs and graph theory. There is much here left to explore
and learn from (e.g. PPI network studies as models for ecological ones). It is a difﬁcult
endeavour, but there are examples of how it can be done, and there will be more in the
near future, including examples of graph structure and system dynamics in ecological
applications.

Synthesis and Future Directions
Introduction
To complete the presentation of relevant material, it remains to provide a synthesis of the
themes and their associated techniques developed in previous chapters, augmented by
some guidance on understanding the relationship between ecological characteristics and
properties or procedures in graph theory. This includes reviewing the applicability of
some major results from graph theory in an ecological context and indicating extensions
of methods to other areas for application. As usual for a book’s ﬁnal chapter, it can also
offer some indications or predictions on developments yet to be made and directions for
researchers to pursue.
There is too much detail to review it all, but the original interest in graph theory
as applied to ecological studies came from its usefulness in quantifying and testing
hypotheses about ecological structure. In addition, it is known that network character-
istics, even as vague as small world versus scale free, can provide some information
on the processes that generated the structure and on its current dynamics. The inten-
tion to demonstrate the relationship between structure and dynamics has been pursued
throughout, but especially in Chapter 11 on graphlets and their interpretation.
12.1
Comparisons and Matching
First is a review some of the critical steps in the application of graph theory to ecolog-
ical studies. The most important step is probably the evaluation of what is observed.
That evaluation can take the form of traditional or numerical assessment of statistical
signiﬁcance, the improbability of the observed outcome, or it can take the form of mea-
surements of inconsistencies or change. Table 12.1 summarizes, in very short form, the
range of approaches to evaluation covered in this book, with the matching examples and
home chapter(s).
Overall, the material covered shows clearly some unifying themes that emerge again
and again from the details and the discussion: orderliness, predictability, stability, hierar-
chies and sub-groupings and asymmetry of several kinds. Of that list, which is certainly
incomplete, “orderliness” is an umbrella term for a large subset of the list, which pairs
in interesting ways with “stability” or “resilience,” and “asymmetry” applies both to the
ecological phenomenon and to the graph theory properties that may go with it. These

are not really the same as the concepts of focus in the standard network analysis, but
they are closely related. The current version of network analysis that is well covered
elsewhere has not been ignored, but we need to look beyond that paradigm to take full
advantage of what graph theory has to offer ecologists. Some of the material in this
volume leads in that direction, but there is a long way yet to go. A start has been made.
Many of the characteristics of ecological systems that can be treated by graph theory
are related somehow to the orderliness of the system, its consistency or predictability or
non-randomness. For simplicity, we can contrast orderliness with randomness and inde-
pendence, because it is only some sort of lack of independence that makes prediction
possible (see Dale & Fortin 2014: “The irony is that the lack of independence is what
makes prediction and hypothesis generation possible, but its very existence causes prob-
lems for the testing of hypotheses . . . ”). Therefore, groupings of species, for example,
would be interpreted as being somehow more orderly than a system in which the species
seemed to respond individually and independently. (Interesting discussions can develop
in a graduate seminar by exploring the evidence for comments like this.) For many of
the structures examined in applications of graph theory to ecological phenomena, there
are one or two such characteristics that are key to evaluating and understanding the
phenomenon, and mostly, these match very well to equivalent graph theory properties.
For example, one critical characteristic of multi-species competition is the consistency
of the outcomes that indicates a hierarchy of competitive ability. This ecological prop-
erty matches well with the graph-theoretical property of transitivity, both qualitative and
quantitative, in the digraph representing competition. The matches between ecological
orderliness and graph theory properties are not perfect, but Table 12.2 provides an indi-
cation of the matches that are most convincing. It is not always entirely obvious what
the directions of the match may be even if it is clear that we have the right match of
characteristics.
It should be evident in the material and the examples presented that the graph theory
methods and understanding do not need to be super-sophisticated to be useful, or even
powerful; some of the simplest concepts are the most helpful. On the other hand, it is fair
to say that much of the sophisticated work in graph theory has not found its application
in ecology (yet) and promises insights that would be impossible otherwise.
The important ecological characteristics can also be discussed in the context of how
they can be related to the stability, persistence or resilience of their system. The list for
stability is shorter because it includes only those with an explicit temporal component,
and again, the matches between ecology and graph theory may be imperfect, and may at
times seem contradictory when compared with the “orderliness” discussion above. For
example, one critical characteristic of multi-species competition is the consistency that
allows a hierarchy of competitive ability. This ecological property matches transitivity
in the digraph representing competition, but inconsistency may be what allows the per-
sistence of “weak” competitors, and thus sustained coexistence (see Ulrich et al. 2014;
Soliveres et al. 2015; Permogorskiy 2015).
In general, stochastic effects will reduce predictability, although if the “degrees of
freedom” are limited, for example in the possible stages of ecological succession for
which only some transitions are possible, the predictability may still be high (consider

a Markov models for these, Figure 12.1). Allowing more transitions may make the
sequence of system states seem less orderly (Figure 12.1), but stochastic transitions may
maintain diversity by preventing a single state from becoming ﬁxed (Figure 12.2). The
example shown is based on a graph of state transitions, but the same sort of argument
applies to trophic networks in which predators have a choice of resources and their use
of these can vary through time, to probabilistic colonization events of habitat islands,
or to the outcomes of competitive interactions whenever there is a stochastic element to
the outcomes.

Note: Ecological characteristics that enhance stability or coexistence or resilience can be matched
to some graph theory characteristics. In some cases, greater orderliness (Table 12.2) can increase
stability (e.g. modularity in trophic networks), in other cases the opposite may be true (e.g. strict
competition hierarchies may enhance extinctions rather than coexistence). In other examples, the
relationship between stability and orderliness may be both positive and negative, depending on
context and focus. For example, highly connected and highly important nodes (hubs) can provide
a stabilizing inﬂuence under normal conditions, but also represent vulnerability for the network
under rare circumstances (Solé & Montoya 2001).
These relationships are certainly fascinating, and potentially controversial. Without
straying too far into the realm of theoretical and mathematical ecology, developing Table
12.3 brings into focus questions such as: Does greater modularity in a trophic network or
in a mutualistic system increase stability or persistence? Does reachability in time-only
or spatio-temporal graphs, related to disease spread, increase or decrease stability. How
does nestedness of species compositions in a real or virtual archipelago affect extinction
and colonization dynamics? Nested mutualistic interactions reduce effective competi-
tion and increase coexistence and biodiversity (Bascompte & Jordano 2014) but trophic
networks are more likely to be more stable if they have compartmentalized and weakly
connected structures (Thébault & Fontaine 2010). As in the discussion on orderliness

related to Table 12.1, we may agree which graph-theoretical characteristics are most
closely related to the ecological stability, and thus which are the ones to evaluate, but it
may not be clear whether the effect is to increase or to decrease the stability.
12.2
What Next?
Some insights into the current state of applications of graph theory in ecology have been
provided here, trying (without too much formal theory) to convey some of the excite-
ment of what has already been accomplished, and to portray accurately how ecologists
can use this knowledge in their own work. Although much has been done already, it
should be clear that there is much more that we can do with existing known techniques
as well as with new and exciting methods yet to be developed. As always, for ecologists,
the main goal is to elucidate and understand the relationship between two complemen-
tary aspects of ecological systems, which can be expressed as “pattern and process” or
“form and function” or “structure and dynamics,” whatever tools are available to help
with this project. I can enumerate just some of the possibilities ahead, but what seems
in order is more of the same, more that is different, more that is new, and more that we
cannot yet imagine.
12.2.1
More of the Same: More Data
There is much to be gained by using existing methods that have already been applied in
ecology to more and perhaps more broadly based data. In many cases, our understanding
of the ecological systems of interest is based on few studies, for example fewer than ten
trophic networks (e.g. Figure 12.3, and see Melián & Bascompte 2004, who used ﬁve).
Given the difﬁculty of collecting high-quality data, that poverty may continue. More
data and data from novel systems will enable us to generalize the understanding gained
with greater conﬁdence. There is also much to be learned from the more familiar meth-
ods when they can be applied to “big data,” data from large spans of space or time or data
that is ﬁnely detailed. A single critical example is the study of climate and weather and
the effects of climate change on biological systems, which generates huge amounts of
data, both meteorological and biological (see Woodward et al. 2010). Fortunately, tech-
niques and software have already been produced for the analysis of big graphs and big
networks for many applications including those of interest in ecology (see Sakr 2013;
Kepner et al. 2013). In fact, graph theory seems to be the essential key to the analysis
of big data (Marsten 2014; Eifrem 2014) because of its use in evaluating how the data
are structured. Some of the value in the network format for ecological data is in the
power to visualize and explore that structure and the relationships within it (Raymond
& Hosie 2009), after all, we often tell students that the ﬁrst step in analysis is to plot
the data; but it can also be useful in suggesting or evaluating plausible causal structures
(Pearl 1988). In some cases of big data, networks are both the data and the mechanism
of analysis (see Cui et al. 2016); just as in computing graphs, trees may be both the
objects of interest and the data structure in which they are stored (Newman 2010, 291).

In addition, graphs are an essential part of many of the recent developments in modern
statistics more generally, including structures like trees, random forests, neural networks
and undirected graphical models for continuous and discrete variables, with known or
unknown structure (see Hastie et al. 2009), although those applications are well outside
the focus of this book.
In some cases, combining methods or approaches that have already been used sepa-
rately will be very helpful, gaining insights from combined analysis. For example, look-
ing at the network of interactions among plants, pollinators, and mycorrhizae (Cahill
et al. 2008) can tell us much more than just the bipartite approaches of plant and pol-
linator or plant and fungus. In the spatial context (Chapter 9), the phrase “sum of all
paths” referred to all possible routes between locations (and paths between nodes); the
multipartite approach could be termed “the sum of all sorts” to include all the kinds
of interactions, whether direct or indirect. Another promising combination is to look
at network function in the context of spatial structure; Baskerville et al. (2011) used a
Bayesian group model on Serengeti trophic network data to identify modular structure
that combines trophic guild structure with spatial pattern. This latter example reﬂects
the organization of this book: ﬁrst by ecological function (predation, social interac-
tions, mutualism and so on) and then by location or dimension (time only, space only,
space and time); that paper presents a good application of what is essentially a function
× location analysis. Similar combined analyses for other systems should prove to be
worthwhile.

12 Synthesis and Future Directions
12.2.2
More That Is Different: Applying Existing Techniques That Have Not Been Used
Second, there are many existing techniques that have not been applied to ecological sys-
tems, but clearly should be. One obvious example is the graphlets spectrum approach
described in Chapter 11. Such approaches may assist with what I see as an important
development from the ecological view, the integration of different categories of interac-
tions into a synthesis of ecological network studies. This includes the fascinating inter-
play of system structure and system dynamics discussed in Chapter 11. There is also a
role for developments in general systems theory beyond but including ecology, such as
the integration or reconciliation of network and hierarchy structures, one having units
treated as equals and one with units ranked in a partially ordered set. Perhaps these could
be treated as “heterarchical” structures that combine features of both, allowing the struc-
tural elements to be unranked or ranked in several different ways (see Cumming 2016).
Many ecological networks that have already been described do have at least one partial
order inherent in their structure (e.g. food web trophic structure) and sometimes more
than one (e.g. trophic structure and body size). A general understanding of the relation-
ships among partial orders in such systems could help in understanding the properties
of the graphs that depict them for analysis.
In Chapter 3, the ongoing work on kernel approaches to structural comparisons was
mentioned, and the topic deserves further discussion with a view to future use and
further development. The general approach of kernel functions is popular in machine
learning and the graph kernels in that application can be based on (random) walks,
paths, small subgraphs of limited size (like motifs or the graphlet subgraphs), or sub-
tree patterns (Shervashidze et al. 2011). Two graphs can be compared by measuring
their similarity using “graph kernels” (Vishwanathan et al. 2010; Shervashidze et al.
2011). Kernel-based approaches are available for pattern analysis particularly as related
to machine learning (Shawe-Taylor & Cristianini 2004) and their use for the compari-
son of “large” graphs has become important in applications in molecular biology and
chemo-informatics, as well as telecommunications and social networks (Borgwardt et al.
2007; Vishwanathan et al. 2010; see also Schölkopf et al. 2004 and Gärtner 2008).
In addition, to follow up on the discussion of using graphlet methods to infer func-
tion from structure, Borgwardt et al. (2005) described the use of graph kernels to pre-
dict protein function based on similarity in sequence, structure, amino acid motifs and
so on.
The basic advantage of the kernel approach is based on the concept of mapping an
object of interest, x, from its own data space into a “feature space” in which analysis
is simpliﬁed by some mapping function, ϕ(x). In order to compare two such objects of
interest, x and xʹ, it may not be ʹ ecessary to convert each one explicitly using function ϕ
(which may be computationally demanding), but rather we can deﬁne a kernel function
based on the cross product or equivalent for which k (x, x′) = < ϕ(x), ϕ(x′)>. This
more direct step for comparison is called the “kernel trick” and the kernel function is
some measure of the similarity of x and x′, because it takes higher values with the more
features shared.

Figure 12.4 Comparing nodes in a graph using graph kernels based on random walks. (a) In G1,
random walks from nodes 2 or node 7 will be very similar. They also belong to the same
graphlet orbits. In G2, random walks from nodes 1 or node 2 will be very similar and they
belong to the same orbits . . . but random walks can become trapped in long cycles in the large
multi-ring subgraph. (b) Within G, random walks from nodes 8 and 9 will be similar although
their graphlet orbits are different. Independent random walks on G and Gʹ from nodes 4 and 4ʹ
will have certain similarities based on structure (based on Vishwanathan et al. 2010).
The kernel approach can be used to evaluate the similarity of two nodes in the same
graph. (These comments are based loosely on Kondor & Lafferty [2002] and presenta-
tions by Vishwanathen that are available on the Web, e.g. www.stat.purdue.edu/∼vishy/
talks/Graphs.pdf and https://archive.org/details/Microsoft_Research_Video_103902.)
Random walks on graphs are useful in evaluating important characteristics of graph
structure (Chapter 9), and for example, in Figure 12.4a, nodes 2 and 7 “look the same”
(and have the same graphlet orbits) and the random walks that start from either node
will be very similar (identical, really). A simple suggestion for the basis of comparison
would be counts of the number and lengths of random walks between the two nodes i
and j. This suggestion does not work as hoped because the random walk can get “lost” in
repeated cycles, as mentioned in Chapter 9, and illustrated in Figure 12.4a. A quick ﬁx
.013
15:27:34

12 Synthesis and Future Directions
is to down-weight long walks (in case they represent these cycles) and a simple weight-
ing for walks of length k is λk/k!, where λ is an appropriately chosen weight parameter
between 0 and 1. Where A is the adjacency matrix of the graph (with 1s in positions
corresponding to edges and 0s elsewhere), Ak enumerates the walks of length k between
nodes i and j. Therefore the kernel that measures the similarity of the two nodes is
K(i, j) =

k=1
λk
k! Ak

ij
= [eλA]ij.
(12.1)
The Laplacian matrix can be substituted for the adjacency matrix, and similar results
are available based on “lazy” random walks in which each iteration may stay on the
current node with a constant probability, rather than always moving to an adjacent node.
In addition, the same analysis applies well, with appropriate changes, when the edges of
the graph have weights associated with them. Overall, this seems like an elegant solution
for nodes within a graph, but will the same approach work for comparing whole graphs?
For comparing whole graphs, the kernel is a function of the two graphs, G and G′,
that measures their similarity and so comparing graphs requires the construction of a
kernel between the graphs that “captures the semantics inherent in the graph structure”
(Vishwanathan et al. 2010). This is not a guidebook of graph theory algorithms, but
there is one that deserves inclusion because it ties together some themes very well (and
it is so cool!): random walk graph kernels (following Vishwanathan et al. 2010).
Random walks are a good basis for evaluating structural characteristics of graphs and
these kernels are based on the idea of having random walks on the two graphs to be
compared and determining the number of walks that match. Vishwanathan et al. (2010)
explained the concept and its application using direct product graphs. G× is the direct
product graph of G and G′; it has nodes corresponding to all pairs of nodes, one from
each of G and G′, and edges in G× joining nodes if and only if both pairs are joined in
G and G′. Figure 12.5a gives an example (it’s almost like a graph-of-graphs). If A and
A′ are the adjacency matrices of the original graphs, then the adjacency matrix of the
direct product graph is the Kronecker product of the two; each “1” in A is replaced by a
full copy of A′, producing what is essentially a “matrix-of-matrices” (see Figure 12.6a
and 12.6b). The adjacency matrix is A×= A ⊗A′. The same holds for the normalized
adjacency matrices: A× = A ⊗A′.
The direct product used here is also called the tensor product; it is not the Cartesian
product that may be more intuitive, and illustrated for contrast in the last panels of
Figure 12.5b, with the matrix version in Figure 12.6c.
Running a random walk on G× is equivalent to running independent random walks
on the original graphs (Gärtner et al. 2003). To create the kernel, a weight matrix, W×is
associated with G×, and with appropriate deﬁnitions, W×= A×, or with normalization,
W× = A×. The kth power of the adjacency matrix gives walks of length k. The kernel
is then based on the probability of simultaneous random walks on G and G′, both of
length k. It is essentially a sum over all walk lengths (the “sum of all walks”) but with
a length-dependent coefﬁcient, μ(k), to eliminate repeated cycles by down-weighting
very long walks (Vishwanathan et al. 2010).

This deﬁnition compares the two graphs but allows much ﬂexibility in the actual
measure, particularly in using different versions of μ(k) to emphasize or down-weight
walks of different lengths. The full details can be found in Vishwanathan et al. (2010),
but it looks like a promising method for applications in ecological studies. The joking
comment above was that this method is the “sum of all walks,” to parallel the phrase

about the “sum of all paths” used elsewhere (e.g. Chapter 9); there is actually a “sum-
of-all-paths” version of this approach, using paths instead of walks, or a “sum of all
shortest paths” (see Borgwardt & Kriegel 2005).
As suggested in Chapter 3, combining this method with tree-based kernels is an obvi-
ous approach to comparing the dendrograms or classiﬁcation structures, such as those
discussed in Chapter 2. Comparing trees requires a determination of all possible sub-
trees (tree motifs of all sizes) and a count of these for each tree: hi(T) occurrences of the
ith subtree in tree T. For trees T and T′, the basic kernel is then
K(T, T ′) =

i=1
hi(T )hi(T ′).
(12.2)
(Gärtner 2008). Tree-based kernels have been used in the analysis of natural languages
(see Moschitti 2006; Sun et al. 2011) and Poon et al. (2013) provide a good example of
this approach in studying the shapes of phylogenetic trees. In a complementary appli-
cation of the technique, Oh et al. (2006) used kernel-based comparisons of metabolic
networks to construct phylogenetic trees for a broad range of organisms, which con-
ﬁrmed the scheme of three domains (Archaea, Eukaryota, Eubacteria) rather than just
two.
A ﬁnal example of kernel-based analysis returns to the structure and dynamics theme
of Chapter 11. Noting that the shapes of phylogenetic trees of viruses (structure) are
determined by host adaptation and virus transmission among hosts (dynamics), phylo-
genetic inference attempts to estimate parameters of these processes from phylogeny
shape, Poon (2015) describes an inspiring study. The study uses subset tree kernel func-
tions to compare phylogenetic tree shapes generated under different phylogenetic situa-
tions; the distance measures thus derived are then combined with an ABC (approximate
Bayesian computation) framework to estimate parameters from the simulated data (the
“kernel-ABC” method). The combined approach was applied to data from an outbreak
of recombinant HIV in China, and proved to provide a versatile approach for phyloge-
netic inference.
Looking ahead to further development and reﬁnement of these kernel-based methods,
we can ask what level of detail might they be used to achieve. Given the overall measure
of similarity between two (large) graphs or trees, can the method identify parts of the
graphs that are most or least similar; characteristics of the graphs that are most or least
similar; or how similarity changes with scale, such as the number of nodes in a walk,
path or sub-tree? The localized graphlet-based kernel approach seems to be the likely
way to proceed, although this is yet to be done explicitly (see Shervashidze et al. 2009;
Lugo-Martinez & Radivojac 2014). Clearly this is a promising approach that can offer
ecologists more help in future versions.
12.2.3
More That Is New: Developing Novel Methods
Third, it is obvious that more and valuable methods based on graph theory are yet to be
developed for ecological applications, and those may await the work of theoreticians and
application ecologists alike, both for systems studies and conservation projects. Given
.013
15:27:34

284
12 Synthesis and Future Directions
recent history of this ﬁeld, there are going to be lots of exciting approaches that have not
even been thought of yet, far less developed and applied. My greatest familiarity with
graphs and graph theory may be mainly from applications for spatial or spatially derived
data, and so I am not in the best position to provide well-founded predictions for the
whole ﬁeld. There seems to be more to be discovered in all the areas described in these
chapters, but it is my guess that the areas that will beneﬁt ecologists most with surpris-
ing results from further research are time-only graphs (think of proximity or encounter
data), other uses for graph fragments, motifs or graphlets (remember “It’s all about sub-
graphs.”), and random walks on graphs (perhaps scales of similarity or dissimilarity in
comparing graphs with kernel functions). The last two are closely related, and random
walk–type kernels can be based on graphlets as well as graphs or trees (Shervashidze
et al. 2009; Lugo-Martinez & Radivojac 2014; software available!). (As an aside, in
Figure 12.4a nodes 2 and 7 give “identical” random walks and have the same graphlet
orbit vectors; in Figure 12.4b, nodes 8 and 9 have different graphlet vectors, but still
produce highly similar random walks.)
Building on what is known is an obvious way to proceed in all areas of applying
graph theory; that’s the call for “more that is new”; but unexpected and valuable ideas
will arise both from theoretical studies and from or inspired by applications well outside
ecology. That’s the call for the fourth sort of “more”: “more that we cannot yet imagine.”
12.2.4
More That We Cannot Imagine: What We Need to Learn
The last area of need is not really within the scope of this book, but it recurred through-
out its development. We need to know more (a lot more) about the basic ecology of
the systems we study. Perhaps this may seem to be a depressing thought, but however
well studied some systems are, for example the boreal ecosystem at Kluane discussed
in Chapter 4, and however much effort and expense has provided insight into some of
the components, there is still so much yet to begin. Consider all the invertebrates and all
the below-ground interactions that are certainly important (Lankau et al. 2010) in that
“relatively simple” ecosystem, and then consider the complexities that must exist in the
speciose communities of warm forests, wetlands, coral reefs or productive savannahs.
There is also the need to include both the many direct inter-speciﬁc interactions, trophic
and non-trophic (Abrams et al. 1996; Bukovinszky et al. 2008; Ings et al. 2008; Ohgushi
2008; Sotomayor & Lortie 2015; Kéﬁet al. 2015), and also the indirect interactions of
various importance and strengths, such as those described and illustrated in Chapter 4
(Figure 4.16). As stated previously, including a range of different ecological interactions
will require a revised system to code edges by category and some modiﬁcations of the
measures of graph structure.
In Chapter 11, a parallel was drawn between the study of ecological interactions
and molecular level research on proteins and protein-protein interactions. In order to
make good predictions about a protein’s function, two kinds of information are needed:
the molecule’s chemical topology and three-dimensional conﬁguration, and its place in
the protein-protein interaction network (Pržulj et al. 2004; Pržulj 2010; Peterson et al.
2012; Winterbach et al. 2013; Yugandhar & Gromiha 2016). In the ﬁeld of ecological

networks, the “program” is not as clearly laid out but it seems implicit in much of the
research described here. In order to make predictions about ecological function and
dynamics, two kinds of information are required: (1) the basic biology of the organisms
and (2) their places in the multi-process interaction networks of competition, preda-
tion, mutualism and so on. Once again, graph theory is the obvious and perhaps only
approach to this complex topic which requires and deserves greater effort.
12.3
Concluding Comments
Preparing this book has been both an exciting adventure and a humbling review of the
gaps in my knowledge, an exploration of what is to be learned and an alluring opening
to future exploration. I might wish that I had attempted the task sooner, but the accu-
mulating wealth of this ﬁeld is very current and moving forward very quickly. It has
been fascinating to watch the organization of this book itself change as it developed
(structure and dynamics, indeed!), and to accept the new perspectives as they occurred.
The case for the exceptional usefulness and general under-use of graph theory and its
concepts for ecological studies was both strong and convincing a decade ago, but the
recent advances and exemplars of applications in other ﬁelds make the case overwhelm-
ing. As stated in the opening chapter, not all the promising approaches or applications
currently have ecological examples or even real examples from other ﬁelds, but there are
many rich possibilities to be explored. In applying networks and graph theory to devel-
oping ecological hypotheses and to answering ecological questions, there are just so
many smart things that can be done! Future developments and new applications will be
exciting indeed and I am looking forward to watching and participating in that progress.
On applications of graph theory in ecology, there is much fascinating work to be done
and there will obviously be much more to be said in the future.

Glossary
Introduction
This glossary does not include every term used in the book, but it provides only the
basics of graph theory. The intention is not to be too formal in the presentation, keeping
mathematical notation and equations to a minimum.
A graph is a mathematical object made up of two sets:
1 {nodes}. These are points or dots in a diagram representing the graph; they are also
called vertices (often denoted by v), and;
2 {edges} = {pairs of nodes}. These are lines in a graph diagram, also called arcs or
links. In a diagram, they can be straight or curved without meaning, because they rep-
resent relationships. Edges may cross with no node at the intersection; the crossings
are not structural (see Figure G1).

The edge designation e(i, j) can be abbreviated to eij. The number of edges
is m.
In a basic graph, the pairs are unordered, with eij equivalent to eji, and the maximum
number of edges is n(n – 1)/2. In a directed graph, or digraph, the edges have directions;
eij is not equivalent to eji and the maximum number of edges is n(n – 1), and it is possible
to have both eij and eji (Figure G2). The nodes can have labels or weights, and the edges
can have weights (including signs, + or −) as well as directions.

A network is a graph that includes quantitative information: the nodes usually repre-
sent things (e.g. people, species, islands . . . ) with weights indicating size, abundance,
potential etc. The edges typically represent connections (e.g. interactions like coop-
eration, relationships such as similarity, physical links like contiguity or migration
routes . . . ) with weights indicating their characteristics, such as intensity, rates and
capacity (Figure G3).
However, the term “network” and the term “graph” are now often treated as synony-
mous, but despite this apparent synonymy, graph theory still seems to be more about
structure and network theory seems to be more about ﬂow or transmission. In addition,
“network” may be the structure depicted and “graph” its depiction, as in “the graph of
the transportation network.”
Terms in Alphabetical Order
Adjacency matrix, A: a square matrix with elements aij= 1 when nodes i and j are
joined by an edge, and 0 otherwise.
Algebraic connectivity: the second eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix; it has
predictive properties for graph connectivity and robustness to deletions.

Arborescence: a directed rooted tree; it is a digraph with no semicycles. There is
exactly one directed path from the root to any other node, and at most one between
any two nodes (Figure G6). There is at most one directed path between any two
nodes.
Aspatial graph: the positions of the elements, in particular the nodes, are not
interpreted as spatial locations, even if the structure originally had a spatial context
or source; space is ignored in the graph itself. The network in Figure G3 is aspatial;
the positions of the nodes are related to the locations of the authors.
Assortative versus disassortative: general terms describing higher versus lower
frequencies of like-to-like edges applying to any characteristics associated with
nodes, not just node degree. In social networks, the term homophily is also used for
having stronger and more frequent associations between nodes of greater similarity;
its opposite is heterophily.
Assortativity coefﬁcient: a correlation measure, r, with values between −1 and +1,
based on the bivariate frequencies of the degrees of neighbour nodes, that
distinguishes between assortative networks with r > 0 indicating positive
autocorrelation and disassortative networks with r < 0 indicating negative
autocorrelation of neighbouring node degrees. This concept is very similarity to
modularity, which measures the relative frequency of “like-to-like” joins, as in a
join-count statistic.
Balance (in signed graphs or signed digraphs): the proportion of cycles that are
positive, having an even number of negative edges (Figure G8).
Betweenness: measures the frequency with which a node occurs in the shortest paths
between other pairs of nodes.

Bipartite graph: the nodes fall into two subsets with edges only between the subsets,
not within (Figure G9c).
Block: a maximal connected subgraph lacking cutpoints. In Figure G5, BCDE is a
block.
Centrality: a measure of the importance of a node’s position in the shortest paths
between other pairs of nodes.
Characteristic path length: of G, the median of the means of path distances from
node i to all other nodes j in G.
Closed walk: a walk that begins and ends at the same node.
Clustering coefﬁcient: a measure of the probability that two neighbours of a given
node (say, j and k as neighbours of node i, with edges eji and eik) are themselves
neighbours (joined by ejk). The matrix version is, given the adjacency matrix entries
aij = 1 and aik = 1, the clustering coefﬁcient is the probability that ajk = 1. This is
sometimes referred to as triad completion or triadic closure.
Complement of graph G is G′: it has the same nodes as G, VG = VG′, and edges
between all and only those pairs of nodes not joined by an edge in G (see Figure
G4). The edges of graph G and G′ together account for all possible edges, the
complete graph.

Complete graph: there is an edge between every pair of nodes (also called a clique).
Component. A graph that is not connected consists of a number of maximally
connected subgraphs called components.
Connectance: while connectedness and connectivity are closely related, connectance
is different; it is the proportion of the positions for edges that actually have an edge.

Glossary
For a simple graph, it is m/[n(n – 1)/2]. Connectance tells little about graph
topology; two graphs with the same connectance can be structurally very different.
Connected graph: there is a path between any two nodes; otherwise the graph is
disconnected (Figure G5).

Nodes HBEF with edges between form a path. Nodes AIH with 3 edges form a cycle. 
Nodes BCDE with their 6 edges, form a subgraph and a complete graph and a block.
B
Connectedness: edge connectedness is the smallest number of edges that can be
removed that will disconnect the graph. Node connectedness is the smallest number
of nodes that can be removed that will disconnect the graph.
Connectivity: A graph is said to have high connectivity if either the edge
connectedness or node connectedness is large.
Crossing number: of a graph is the smallest number of pairwise intersections of edges
when the graph to be drawn in the plane.
Cut-edge (or bridge): an edge in a connected graph the removal of which disconnects
the graph (Figure G5).
Cut-point: a node in a connected graph the removal of which disconnects the graph
(Figure G5).
Cut-set: a set of edges the removal of which disconnects the graph; the cut size is the
number of edges between the two clusters of a partitioned graph whose removal will
disconnect them.
Cycle: a path that begins and ends at the same node, with no node or edge used more
than once (sometimes called a loop). A cycle is a path that is a closed walk. In a
digraph, a cycle must follow the directions of the edges; a polygon of edges in a
digraph that do not form a cycle is a semi-cycle (Figure G2).
.014

Glossary

Degree: the number of edges attached to a node. In a digraph, each node has both an
in-degree, the number of edges of which it is the sink, and an out-degree, the
number of edges of which it is the source (Figures G1 and G2).
Degree matrix, D: a square matrix that has 0s everywhere but on the main diagonal,
which lists the degrees of the nodes. (For a digraph, this can be either the in-degree
or the out-degree.)
Diameter: a graph’s diameter is the maximum distance between any two nodes, where
distance is the length of the shortest path between the two (Figure G7).
Digraph: A directed graph consists of a set of nodes with a set of edges that have
direction, so that the edge from A to B is different from the edge from B to A. In a
digraph, e(i, j) is not equivalent to e(j, i), meaning that A →B ࣔB →A (Figure
G1). It is possible that a particular pair of nodes is joined by two edges, one in each
direction, i.e. both A →B and B →A (Figure G2).
Directed acyclic graph: a graph with directed edges that contains no directed cycles
but may have semi-cycles; i.e. its underlying graph may not be a tree and may have
non-directed cycles. Figure G6 shows a directed tree and a directional acyclic
graph. In the directed tree, there is at most one directed path between any two
nodes; in the acyclic digraph, there can be several. Every aborescence is a directed
acyclic graph but not every acyclic graph is an aborescence.

Distance: (between nodes) can be measured in several ways, number of edges in the
shortest path, physical distance in a spatial graph, or costs in a transportation
network (Figure G7).
Distance graph: a kind of spatial graph, in which the nodes occur at locations in a
Euclidean metric space and the edges between them take the values of the Euclidean
distances between the points in that space (e.g. spatial graph; Figure G7).

Empty graph: has nodes but no edges. In Figure G4, upper panel, nodes 1, 2 and 4
form an empty subgraph.
Forest: acyclic graph that is not connected; it consists of components that are trees.
Geodesic path: the shortest or minimum weight path between two nodes.
Geometric graph: a spatial graph in d-dimensional space, which uses a measure of
distance within the space, possibly Euclidean. Edges are determined by an upper
threshold on internode distance.
Graph: a mathematical object made up of two sets: (1) {nodes}, the points in a graph
diagram, and (2) {edges} = {pairs of nodes}, represented by the lines joining nodes
in pairs (Figure G1).
Graphlet: a subgraph of up to ﬁve nodes. What is counted is not the graphlets
themselves but the frequency of nodes at each distinct location in all graphlets. In
general, a motif is counted even if it is not an induced subgraph of the graph being
analyzed; in graphlet analysis, only induced subgraphs are considered (see
Figure G4).
Graph-of-graphs: a structure in which each node of a graph at one level consists of, or
has associated with it, a graph of its own.
Incidence matrix, B: a rectangular matrix in which the rows are the nodes and the
columns are the edges; for an undirected graph, the elements bik= 1 when edge k is
attached to node i, and 0 otherwise. For a digraph, bik= 1 when node i is the source
of edge k, bik= −1 when it is the sink, and 0 otherwise.
Joint degree distribution: tabulates the bivariate distribution of the degrees of nodes
joined by an edge, f(di, dj), where eijࣔ0, in order to determine whether the degrees

of neighbouring nodes are positively or negatively autocorrelated. The frequency
can be converted into the assortativity coefﬁcient, which distinguishes between
positive autocorrelation and negative autocorrelation of neighbouring node degrees.
These measures can be calculated from the adjacency matrix, A.
Laplacian matrix, L: a square matrix derived by subtracting the adjacency matrix
from the degree matrix: L = D – A.
Lattice graph: can be drawn as a regular lattice in two dimensions; the edges form a
regular tiling of the plane. The lattice is usually square, as for spatial raster data, but
possibly triangular or hexagonal. All nodes except those on the boundaries have the
same degree.
Length: a path’s length is the sum of the weights of the edges in the path; in simple
cases, the number of edges. The graph theory distance between any two nodes in a
graph is just the shortest path between them (Figure G7). In some applications, the
shortest or minimum weight path is called a geodesic path. In a spatial graph or
spatial digraph, paths also have physical distance lengths or lengths determined by
transport costs (Figure G7).
Line graph: G′ derived from G; nodes in G′ are the edges of G, edges in G′ join edges
from G that share a node in G.
Module: a subgraph with a high relative frequency of joins between nodes within it
and few outside; it can also refer to a high frequency of edges between nodes with
similar characteristics (e.g. labels). Modules of nodes are also called “clusters” or
“communities.” In a graph or digraph with signed edges, well-deﬁned modules
have only positive edges within them and negative edges external to them
(Figure G8).

Glossary
Modularity: the tendency of network neighbours to have similar characteristics, or
index of the relative frequency of “like-to-like” joins in the network graph (similar
to a join-count statistic). It can also refer to how easily the graph can be partitioned
into distinct modules with high internal but low external connectivity.
Motif: a small subgraph of deﬁned structure that recurs in the graph(s) being studied.
Motifs have three or four nodes, and the frequency of each is used to make
inferences about structure.
Network: a graph that includes quantitative information, usually representing aspects
of a real system (Figure G2): the nodes represent things (e.g. species, islands) with
weights indicating size, abundance, potential etc.; the edges represent connections
(e.g. interactions like predation, relationships such as similarity, physical links like
contiguity or migration routes) with weights indicating their characteristics such as
intensity, rates, capacity etc. In many biological applications, “network” and
“graph” are treated as synonyms.
Partitioning: the process or problem of dividing a graph into smaller components
based on speciﬁc characteristics or criteria. For example, to divide a graph into
modules or node clusters maximizing edges within clusters and minimizing edges
between.
Path: an alternating sequence of nodes and edges in which each node is attached to the
next node in the sequence by an edge; and each edge in the path is joined to the
subsequent edge at a node to which they are both attached (Figure G1). No node or
edge may be used more than once in the same path.
Path graph: an unbranched tree; for n nodes, the 2 end nodes have degree 1, and all
the other n – 2 nodes have degree 2. Adding an edge between the two end nodes
converts a path graph to a ring graph, and removing any edge from a ring graph
creates a path graph.
Phylogenetic tree: this tree depicts evolutionary history with nodes of degree 1
(leaves) representing the taxa, a root of degree 1, representing the common ancestor,
and branch nodes of degree 3, indicating points of evolutionary divergence.
Planar graph: can be drawn in a two-dimensional plane with no edges crossing.
(Remember that the edges do have to be drawn as straight lines; they can curve
around the outside. G1 in Figure G1 is planar as is the full graph in Figure G5.) A
minimum planar graph is a spatial planar graph (no edges crossing) that uses the
smallest total length of edges.
Random walk: a walk from node to node in which, at each iteration, the next edge to
be included is chosen at random according to some rule, such as equal probability
for all edges attached to the current node.
Reciprocity of a digraph: the proportion of all edges that are members of reciprocal
pairs of edges between the same two nodes (in opposite directions). The digraph in
Figure G2 has two edges out of ﬁve that form a reciprocal pair; one of six node pairs
has both reciprocal edges.
Reciprocity index of a digraph: measures the frequency of bidirectional edges, the
proportion of edges that occur in pairs between the same two nodes. For an
.014

unsigned digraph and its adjacency matrix, the reciprocity index is R =[ࢣࢣaij ×
aji] ÷ࢣࢣaij. For the digraph in Figure G2, that is 0.25.
Regular graph: all nodes have the same degree. A complete graph, which has all
possible edges (each node has degree n – 1) is a regular graph; so is a ring graph
where the nodes all have degree 2 (e.g. Figure G9c).
Ring graph: each node has two adjacent neighbours (degree 2), and there is only one
cycle: the whole graph; this must be a connected graph, most clearly drawn as a
simple ring (Figure G9c).
Semi-cycle: In a digraph, walks, paths and cycles must follow the directions of the
edges they include; similar-looking subgraphs that do not follow the edge directions
are called semi-walks, semi-paths and semi-cycles; therefore a semi-cycle is a
closed polygon of nodes and edges without repetition that does not follow all the
directions of the edges it includes (see Figure G2).
Signed digraph: the edges have both signs and directions. In the adjacency matrix,
each element, aij, takes one of three values, +1, 0 or −1; for any pair of nodes, there
are nine edge combinations possible. Edge signs are indicated by solid for positive
and broken for negative (Figure G8b).
Signed graph: the edges have signs, + or – (essentially a binary weight), indicating
the nature of the relationship portrayed, such as reinforcing versus antagonistic
interactions. Edge signs are usually indicated by solid for positive and broken or
dashed for negative (Figure G8a).
Spanning tree: a connected subgraph of G that is a tree and includes all nodes of G; a
minimum spanning tree does so with the smallest total edge length. In Figure G4,
the subgraph with three edges (bottom left) is a spanning tree of the induced
subgraph with ﬁve edges.
Spatial graph and digraph: the nodes have spatial locations; this means that edges,
and thus paths, have weights that are physical distances or weights related to
transport or communication (Figure G7).
Spatio-temporal graph and digraph: the nodes of these graphs have locations in both
time and space, which means the edges, and thus paths, have physical and temporal
distances.
Spectral properties: a graph’s spectrum is the set of eigenvalues of the adjacency or
Laplacian matrix. The spectral gap is the difference between the ﬁrst and second
eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix. The algebraic connectivity is the second
eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix. Both have predictive properties for connectivity
and robustness to deletions.
Subgraph: J is a subgraph of graph G, if it includes only nodes that are a subset of the
nodes of G, and edges that are a subset of the graph’s edges that join pairs of nodes
in J. More formally, VJ is a subset of VG and EJ is a subset of EGࢵVJ ×VJ. A
subgraph is induced if it contains all the edges of G it possibly can, so that EJ =
EGࢵVJ ×VJ. The difference is illustrated in Figure G4, lower panels.
Temporal or “time-only” graph: the nodes have locations in time, which means that
there is directionality inherent in the whole structure and “distance” is measured in
time.

Glossary
Tournament: an unsigned digraph with exactly one directed edge between each pair of
nodes. A property of interest for tournaments is transitivity. The triangle is
transitive if edges A →B and B →C are accompanied by A →C; it is intransitive
if it has the form A →B, B →C and then C →A (see Figure G1, lower panel).
The transitivity of the entire tournament is measured by the proportion of triangles
that are transitive.
Transitivity of a triangle in a digraph: based on the directional interactions among
three nodes: if A →B and B →C, then A →C, the triangle of edges is transitive
(see Figure G2).
Tree: a connected graph that contains no cycles; see Figure G9a. A rooted tree has a
single node designated as the root; all other nodes can be characterised by their
distance (path length) from the root, creating an intrinsic ordering for the tree; see
Figure G9b.

and is connected.

Triangulation: a planar graph in which the edges create a plane tiling of cntiguous
triangles, not necessarily identical. Spatial graphs based on geographic regions or
political boundaries are often represented as Delaunay or other triangulations.
Walk: any alternating sequence of nodes and edges in which each node is attached to
the next node in the sequence by an edge; unlike a path, a walk can use the same
elements more than once (Figure G1).
Weighted graph: nodes can have weights, such as counts, and edges can have
numerical weights, such as relationship intensity or measures of similarity or
“distance” (Figure G3 and spatial graphs in Figure G7).
