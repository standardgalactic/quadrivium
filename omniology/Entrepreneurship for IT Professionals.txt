Preface
When prospective entrepreneurs plan to start a business they often have a good idea 
or something that inspire them to start a business. This part, the identifi cation of an 
opportunity, is usually the easy part for born entrepreneurs as they are creative and 
innovative and have the ability to identify opportunities. However, then the questions 
start as they soon realise that there are various pre-requisites and procedures involved 
in starting and establishing a business. 
 To assist you, the start-up entrepreneur, we have combined relevant work of 
entrepreneurs and specialists in the different phases as well as related fi elds of 
entrepreneurship to plan, start and grow your own business. This book provides a 
comprehensive introduction to the entrepreneur, the process of planning and starting 
your own business, introducing you to the world of business and ultimately to growing 
your own business. Successful entrepreneurs contributed by providing valuable 
information about what had been needed in the different phases of start-up and 
establishing their businesses. In addition, all the authors of this book have personal 
experience as entrepreneurs, as business advisors and as subject specialists.
In this book the procedure that the entrepreneur has to follow before establishing a 
business is described in detail, and guidelines are provided on identifying a feasible 
business idea, carrying out viability study, and, fi nally, drawing up a business plan. 
We are well aware that many successful entrepreneurs go through this procedure 
informally and never put anything down in writing. In this book we guide you through 
the procedure, as it is especially necessary for the younger, less experienced and nascent 
entrepreneur to work through it.
Some of the most important and essential functions that have to be addressed by the 
entrepreneur, such as marketing, fi nance, operations, human resources and purchasing, 
are also dealt with, as they are relevant to a start-up or new businesses.
We aim to guide you on:
• being positive about even your seemingly most insignifi cant talents, skills and 
knowledge, and using them, while acknowledging your weak points and doing 
something about them;
• being creative yet practical in your search for business ideas, and believing in 
whatever you attempt;

Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
xvi
•	 researching your business idea and ensuring that it will be profitable;
•	 planning the way you will be doing business; and
•	 establishing and managing important functions like financing, marketing, 
operations, purchasing and human resources.
Willingness to learn is the first step in understanding entrepreneurship and business. 
By learning, looking and doing, you can achieve success.
Have fun in planning and starting your own business, and good luck!

Chapter
1.1 LEARNING OUTCOMES 
After you have studied this chapter, you should be able to: 
• explain the motivation for setting up a business 
• analyse the relationship between the business and its establishment 
• distinguish between the terms ‘branch of industry’ and ‘production branch,’ using examples 
to illustrate them and their use in classifying a business 
• arrange the three sectors in which businesses are grouped and provide suitable examples 
• draw an industrial column for a product to illustrate the route it follows  – from the raw 
material stage, to delivery, to the customer 
• describe the micro environment of the business 
• explain the market environment and the variables which infl uence the business’s growth 
and existence
• identify the macro environment and all the forces and infl uences which affect the business.
1.2 
INTRODUCTION
We are going to look at two important concepts in this chapter – basic business concepts 
and principles, and the reason why the environment is so important in the business 
world. 
The fi rst part of this chapter will look at the enterprise as a need-satisfying organisation 
in the free-market system and show the relationship between the enterprise and the 
establishment. This section will clarify how entities are categorised into branches of 
industry and production. After the categorisation we will explain the different sectors 
of the economy in which these entities operate and describe how raw materials and 
products move through these sectors to reach the end-consumer. These are all ‘basic 
business concepts’.

Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
Consider whether it is possible for a business to exist in total isolation. Ask yourself if 
it is possible for a business to grow and exist if factors such as the customer and his or 
her needs, competitor activity and prevailing economic and political conditions are not 
taken into consideration. The answer to these questions should be no: of course it is not 
possible for any business, large or small, to function in isolation. 
To be successful, a business must stay in constant contact with the market environment 
so that it remains up to date with changing customer needs, changing technology and  
competitor activities. The business and the community in which it functions are 
therefore mutually dependent and influence each other. The entrepreneur takes the 
initiative, continually looking for new ideas, new products and improved methods of 
doing business. The entrepreneur’s motivation is to make a profit and also to stimulate 
the environment to innovate and change. 
A business manufactures long-playing records (LPs). Because of technological changes, 
most people today prefer compact discs (CDs and DVDs).
What do you think will happen to this business? Do you think there is still a demand for 
long-playing records? How many of you know what a long-playing record is? Or listen to 
long-playing records? The need (demand) and environment for this type of business has 
changed.
Every business functions within an environment (the business environment) where 
events and variables influence its activities. These events may pose opportunities or 
threats to the business. Technological development is a good illustration (think about 
the example above) of fluctuations in the market. On the one hand technology offers 
opportunities because new products and services are created, while on the other hand it 
can constitute a threat because it may result in products or services becoming obsolete.
As an entrepreneur, you must be aware of environmental variables and changes. With 
knowledge of these changes, you can develop a plan of action to deal with potential 
opportunities or threats. Without this knowledge, your business will not grow or may even 
cease to exist.
It is also important that you understand some basic business concepts, such as the role 
your business (or proposed business) plays in a free-market system, how different 
entities are categorised into branches of industry and production, the different sectors 
of the economy and how raw materials and products move through these sectors to 
reach the customer.

1.3	
THE BUSINESS 
A business or enterprise can be described as an independent institution, established by 
an entrepreneur to make a profit by producing goods or providing services that satisfy 
customers’ needs. Therefore, the entrepreneur identifies a customer need and creates a 
business to produce goods and/or provide services to satisfy that need. The motive for the 
entrepreneur’s action is to make a profit. In both cases the entrepreneur and the customer 
benefit from the creation of the business – the customer is able to satisfy his or her needs, 
while the entrepreneur makes a profit.  
1.3.1	 The relationship between the business and the establishment 
The establishment can be described as the place where inputs such as raw materials and 
other components are processed to produce a product or provide a service. Production 
activities take place in the establishment.  
The best way of explaining the relationship between the business and the establishment 
is to look at Figure 1.1. The figure illustrates the shoe manufacturing business started by 
Tumi Lekoto. Tumi combines the production factors of natural resources, capital, labour 
and entrepreneurship in his business. Tumi (the entrepreneur) will employ people to 
work for him (labour). He will also buy (capital) the raw materials (natural resources) 
he needs to manufacture the shoes. 
Once the production process is complete, the end product (shoes) can be sold using the 
marketing activities to generate income for Tumi’s business. He will also use the external 
relations activities to improve the image of his business. The general management and 
administrative functions will oversee all the activities. 
The establishment is one part of the business. The ‘business’ or ‘enterprise’ is the place where 
all the business functions take place (for example marketing, management, administration) 
but the establishment refers only to the place where the product is made or the service is 
provided.

The branch of industry and the production branch
Table 1.1 explains the difference between a branch of industry and the production 
branch.

Chapter 1: Basic business concepts and the business environment

Table 1.1: Branch of industry versus production branch 
Branch of industry
Production branch
A branch of industry refers to all the 
businesses that produce more or less the same 
product or provide the same service. 
The production branch refers to all the 
businesses that use more or less the same 
production processes.
For example:
For example:
The gold mines produce the same product – 
gold.
All mines, eg gold, diamond and coal, form 
part of the mining production branch because 
they all use the same production process – the 
extraction of natural resources through mining.
The different sectors in which a business can operate 
There are three sectors in which a business can operate:
•	 primary sector 
•	 secondary sector 
•	 tertiary sector. 
The activities that take place in the establishment determine the sector in which the 
business operates.
•	 The primary sector: This sector is responsible for the exploitation of natural re-
sources in their raw, unprocessed form. 
•	 The secondary sector: In the secondary sector, the exploited natural resources are 
processed and transformed into products demanded by customers. 
•	 The tertiary sector: This sector is responsible for distributing the final products from 
the manufacturer to the customer. 
The industrial column 
The industrial column is the course that a product follows from its unprocessed, natural 
resource state to the final form in which it is supplied to the customer. This includes all the 
processes and transactions that take place from the primary sector, through the secondary 
sector and along to the tertiary sector, from where it is passed on to the customer.

1.4 
THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
The business environment is the sum total of all the factors and variables that infl uence 
the creation, growth and continued existence of a business either positively or negatively, 
thereby promoting or hindering the achievement of its objectives.   
The business environment is usually divided into three components, namely the micro 
(the internal environment), the market and the macro environments (both part of the 
external environment). These three components each have a variety of variables that 
can infl uence the business either positively or negatively.
These variables are discussed in the following sections. Figure 1.3 gives an overall pic-
ture of the business environment. (The business is identifi ed as the central point in this 
fi gure.) Table 1.2 illustrates the three components and their variables.

Table 1.2: The components and variables of the business environment
The micro environment
This is the business itself. We can distinguish between the following variables:
• the mission statement and objectives of the business
• the functions of the business
• the production factors of the business.
The market environment
This setting surrounds the business and is part of the external environment. The main variables 
include:
• the market
• the competition
• the suppliers of resources and services (without which the business would not be able to 
manufacture and market its products and/or provide services).                                        ➠

Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
The macro environment
The macro environment surrounds the market environment and the business. We can distinguish 
between the following sub-environments:
•	 economic environment (economic conditions)
•	 social environment
•	 technological environment
•	 physical environment
•	 political and statutory environment
•	 international environment.
1.4.1	 The micro environment 
The micro environment is the heart of the business. It indicates to what extent the 
business is able to utilise opportunities or oppose threats in the external environment. 
The micro environment is the sum total of all the factors and variables which occur internally 
in the business and are influenced in a direct or indirect way by management decisions. 
These factors and variables have a fundamental influence on the establishment and on the 
growth and continued existence of the business.   
What follows is a brief discussion of the three variables of the micro environment. 
The mission statement and objectives of the business 
This is what the business hopes to achieve and the way in which it can be achieved. 
The mission statement and objectives must correspond with the demands of the external 
environment. 
The functions of the business 
These include the following divisions that will be discussed in more detail overleaf:
•	 general management 
•	 personnel management
•	 operations management 
•	 purchasing management 
•	 marketing management 
D

Chapter 1: Basic business concepts and the business environment

•	 public relations management 
•	 administrative management 
•	 financial management. 
General management: General management differs from the other functions because 
it cannot be placed in a department on its own. General management concerns all the 
activities that are necessary on all levels throughout the entire organisation. 
Personnel management: Personnel management includes all the activities concerned 
with the procurement, development, compensation, integration and maintenance of the 
personnel of the organisation. 
Operations management: This refers to the management process used in both 
manufacturing and service enterprises. Operations management can be described as those 
management activities that take place so that products and services can be provided to 
satisfy the needs of the consumer. 
Purchasing management: The purchasing function deals with the procurement of all the 
resources an organisation needs to achieve its objectives. This includes, among other things, 
the determination of purchasing needs, the establishment of alternative suppliers who can 
satisfy these needs and the negotiation of agreements with suppliers to the long-term 
advantage of the organisation. 
Marketing management: Marketing is the process of transferring goods and services 
to customers in order to satisfy their needs, as well as the activities that make the transfer 
possible. Marketing therefore entails more than just advertising products and services; it 
includes a variety of activities cutting across all functions of the enterprise. 
Public Relations management: Public relations is the management function that 
evaluates public attitudes, identifies the policies and procedures of an individual or 
organisation with a public interest, and plans and executes a programme of action to earn 
public acceptance and understanding. 
Administrative management: The administrative function can be defined as being 
concerned with the service of obtaining, recording and analysing information, and 
communicating the results to management who then can safeguard the assets, promote 
the activities and achieve the objectives of the organisation. 
Financial management: Financial management refers to the management of the 
business’s financial activities. The financial functions therefore include all the activities 
involved in obtaining capital and the efficient use thereof. The financial manager is 
responsible for the effective planning, organising and control of all the financial activities 
in the organisation.

The production factors of the business 
These include the resources available to a business, such as labour, raw materials (eg 
minerals, timber, water etc), capital and entrepreneurship. With these resources the 
business must utilise opportunities to ward off threats in the external environment. For 
example, if a business has sufficient capital available, new markets and new products 
can be explored. On the other hand, a lack of capital may constitute a threat to the 
business because, unlike its competitors, the business is in a weaker position in the 
market. 
The influence of management on the micro environment 
As the manager of your own business, you will exert a direct influence on the mission 
statement and objectives of the business. You will decide where the business is going 
and what it will do to get there, and establish guidelines for its day-to-day operation. 
1.4.2	 The market environment 
The market can be defined as the link between the business and the environment in 
which it functions. It surrounds the micro environment. 
The market environment is the sum total of all the factors and/or variables which exist 
externally that cannot be controlled but can sometimes be influenced so that it will have a 
positive or negative effect on the growth and existence of a business.   
The market environment is surrounded by the macro environment (see Figure 1.3 on 
page 7). The market environment therefore does not exist in isolation but is in fact 
influenced by both the micro and macro environments. We can explain this interaction 
by means of the following examples. 
A new shampoo is introduced to the market. Customers prefer the new shampoo to existing 
products (in other words, it is preferred to the competitors’ products). 
A company changes its credit and collection policy. This step has an influence on its 
customers because, for example, some people may prefer to buy items on credit, even if they 
know that the prices are inflated to make provision for credit risks (the possibility of bad 
debts). Some customers may therefore prefer to buy clothes from a store such as Edgars, 
which offers credit facilities, rather than Erica Fashions, which does not.
The market environment is also influenced by the macro environment. During a 
downward trend in the economy, for example, customers have less money to spend 
on luxury items, which will lead to a reduction in the sale of luxury products, such as 
expensive dinner services, clothing and luxury cars.

Three variables are unique to the market environment, namely:
•	 the market
•	 the competition
•	 suppliers of resources and services.
The market
Here we refer in an abstract sense to ‘the market’ which concerns the customer and his 
or her needs rather than the physical marketplace.
The business manufactures or buys products and/or provides services with the object-
ive of selling these (to either individual customers or other businesses or institutions). 
However, before a customer can become active in the market, he or she must have 
financial means (money). These financial means can be used to acquire the available 
goods and/or services. The customer has to choose between different goods and 
services because he or she has limited financial means. It can also happen, however, 
that although the customer has the necessary financial means, he or she is not prepared 
to buy the available goods and services.
From the point of view of the business, the market therefore includes all individuals, groups 
or institutions who have specific needs for goods and services and who are prepared to use 
their available financial means to acquire the goods or services.
•	 The market of a clothing shop such as Edgars includes all people with a need for 
clothing who are prepared to spend their money on the available articles. Their activities 
are therefore directed at satisfying their needs.
•	 The market of South African Airways includes all people with a need to travel domestically 
or internationally who have the financial means to pay for the air tickets. These people 
must therefore be prepared to spend money on an air ticket in order to satisfy a need 
(to travel).
•	 Some manufacturing businesses trade only with wholesalers and retailers and not with 
the general public. Their market therefore comprises other businesses. For example, you 
cannot buy a writing pad directly from Sappi; you have to obtain it from a retailer who 
sells stationery. The retailer, in turn, has bought the writing pad from a manufacturer 
such as Croxley, who bought paper from Sappi.
Different segments of the market have been identified from these examples. Here is a 
further breakdown.
NB

Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
•	 The consumer market: This market consists of the end-customers who carry out 
transactions in order to buy and consume items such as clothing, food or cars. 
•	 The industrial market: In this market, goods and services are purchased and used 
for the manufacture of products or the provision of services to end-customers. As 
mentioned before, Croxley buys paper from a paper and pulp business such as 
Sappi in order to manufacture writing pads, envelopes and cards. A business that 
manufactures kitchen cupboards also utilises the industrial market when it buys 
pressed-wood panels from Sappi Novaboard to manufacture its products. 
•	 The resale market: In this market, manufactured goods are purchased by businesses 
with the sole purpose of reselling them to individuals or other businesses at a profit. 
Pick n Pay, for example, buys canned vegetables and fruit (such as Koo and All 
Gold) to sell at a profit to its customers. 
•	 The international market: International markets exist outside the borders of a 
country where a product is produced and include all foreign customers, manu-
facturers, retailers and authorities. For example, European traders buy South 
African fruit on the international market. 
•	 The government market: In order to provide services and carry out its functions, 
government and municipal authorities purchase a range of goods and services, such 
as:
P
P
furniture and equipment for use in government schools 
P
P
system/s to pay salaries to teachers, the police, government officials 
P
P
fire-fighting equipment 
P
P
medical supplies and services. 
When discussing the market, we should not forget that the customer has certain rights. 
As an entrepreneur, you should be aware of these rights in order to keep abreast of 
customers’ needs. Institutions such as the Consumer Council focus on informing 
customers of their rights. These rights are summarised below. 
The customer has the right to: 
•	 Be informed: The customer should receive objective information about the available 
products and/or services. The business may not mislead or harm the customer by 
withholding information about a specific product. For example, the customer has 
a right to know the ingredients in a tin of canned food and whether it contains 
colourants or preservatives. 
•	 Exercise personal choice: A variety of products and services are available in the 
market and the customer has the right to decide which product or service he or 
she is going to buy. For example, the customer has the right to choose between All  
Gold and Koo products. 

Chapter 1: Basic business concepts and the business environment
13
•	 Be heard: The business must be geared towards listening to and responding to 
customer complaints and requests. For example, if a customer complains about poor 
service, the entrepreneur/manager should respond to these complaints. 
•	 Protection: The customer’s safety is important and he or she should be protected 
against unsafe products, for example by health warnings on cigarette packets. 
The competition 
An example of competition is the variety of cars available today, as well as the number 
of dealers who sell these cars. The choice between different products indicates that 
there is competition in the market. 
Competition boils down to the fact that each business tries to convince consumers that its 
products and services are the best and that consumers should therefore buy from them.
As an entrepreneur, you must be aware of competitor activity because the actions of 
competitors may constitute a threat to your business. You must be aware of new or 
improved products on the market. Therefore it is vitally important to be informed 
about the competition in the external business environment. You must know who your 
competitors are, where they are situated (the geographic distribution), the products 
they offer the market, the quality of the products, the specific markets they serve, what 
their share of the market is, their financial resources and their general image in the 
marketplace. 
Over and above the fact that businesses compete with one another’s products and 
services, we can also distinguish between different types of competition. 
The suppliers of resources and services 
You must decide which products you are going to manufacture and market, the 
quantities you can produce and the capital necessary for the project. However, you 
will be dependent on other institutions in the external environment to carry out your 
activities because you will not necessarily have the raw materials to manufacture your 
products. You will therefore have to rely on external suppliers for many products or 
services.
This example deals with a business that manufactures wooden furniture and how it interacts 
with the external environment.
•	 To manufacture its furniture, the company must buy wood, tools, glue, nails and various 
other products. All of these items must be bought from external suppliers.
➠
NB
eg

14
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
•	 The business uses water, electricity, communication channels and other services. All of 
these must be bought from the external environment, such as Eskom for electricity and 
Telkom for communication services.
•	 The business must make use of a bank or other financial institution so that it can pay 
wages and salaries and pay its suppliers. They may also need a loan at some stage, for 
instance if they want to expand the business and build new premises.
•	 The business decides to build a bigger factory. They must use the services of an external 
property broker to buy the land and external builders and contractors to build the new 
premises.
•	 The larger factory needs additional staff. An external recruitment company is used to fill 
the new vacancies.
•	 Finally, the business must sell its furniture. To do this, they use an intermediary – in this 
case a wholesaler – who markets the product and sells it to a retailer (let’s say Joshua 
Doore), who then sells the furniture to the end-customer.
1.4.3	 The macro environment
The macro environment surrounds the business and its marketing environment. It is 
made up of a wide range of variables which can affect the business and its marketing 
activities, either positively or negatively.
The macro environment consists of all the variables and factors outside the business which 
have a positive or negative influence on the growth and continued existence of the business 
and which encourage or hinder the achievement of its objectives.   
The individual business has no control over the macro environment or the variables 
which operate within it. For example, a business has no control over a rise in interest 
rates or a change in the exchange rate. However, these changes impact every business 
in some way. 
The macro environment consists of a number of sub-environments which are usually 
described as ‘variables’ or ‘forces’. Here we refer to economic, sociocultural, political, 
technological, statutory, physical and international influences and forces. 
What follows is a brief discussion of each of the sub-environments already identified. 
(a)  Economic environment (economic conditions) 
The economic environment is that part of the macro environment consisting of factors 
which influence the personal disposable income of the customer as well as his or her 
D

Chapter 1: Basic business concepts and the business environment
15
purchasing behaviour. (The term ‘customer’ is used here in its widest sense, it also 
includes other businesses.) The customer has limited financial means to satisfy all his 
or her needs and is therefore forced to make choices. 
The customer’s disposable income is influenced by many economic factors, for example, 
interest rates and exchange rates, inflation, trade cycles and the economic growth rate. 
Interest rates 
An interest rate is an indication of the price at which money can be bought, in other 
words, the price at which money is available on the money and capital markets. If the 
interest rate is 20 % per annum for a long-term loan of R100 000, this means that the 
borrower must pay an additional R20 000 per year (20/100 × R100 000) to secure the 
loan of R100 000. This is therefore the price that the borrower must pay for the money 
he or she wishes to borrow. 
A rise in interest rates usually results in a decrease in spending. If someone wants to buy 
a car, for example, he or she will have to pay more to borrow the money and ultimately, 
pay more for the car. Suppose the buyer buys a car through hire purchase financing  
and interest rates subsequently rise. This means that the buyer’s monthly instalments 
will also increase and that he or she will pay even more for the vehicle in the long run. 
The bond on a home loan works in the same way; as soon as the interest rates rise, so do 
the monthly loan instalments. The opposite scenario is also true. 
Inflation
Inflation results in a continual rise in the prices of products and services. This has 
a depressing effect on the economy because the purchasing power of the rand, and 
therefore also the purchasing power of the customer, decreases as inflation rises. The 
customer is able to buy fewer products for the same amount because the value of the 
money has decreased as a result of inflation. Since the late seventies, South Africa  
has had to deal with the negative influence of inflation, in some years this has reached 
double figures.
The influence of inflation is clear from the following examples:
•	 In 1980 we paid 30c for a loaf of white bread. In 2010 we paid R5.90 for the same loaf 
of bread and today we pay R10.50.
•	 In 1980 we paid 76c for a dozen eggs; in 1985 we paid R1.31. In 2010 we paid R5.95 
and today we pay R39.55.
Trade cycles
All economies are subject to certain cyclical changes. We can distinguish between 
different phases in the economic cycle, namely a period of prosperity, followed by a 
eg

16
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
period of recession and depression and then a period of recovery. You should be aware 
of the phase through which the economy is moving as this influences the management, 
growth and continued existence of the business.
Each phase makes its own demands on the business.
•	 During a phase of prosperity, the business (the marketing and production divisions) 
has the opportunity to manufacture and market new products. The business 
therefore has the opportunity to explore new markets and to expand its share of the 
market.
•	 In contrast, during a recession customers’ disposable incomes are lower and they 
therefore buy less. This has a direct influence on the demand for products and/or 
services and therefore also on the growth of a business.
•	 During the recovery phase, the business must prepare itself for the economic growth 
that will take place and should, for example, pay attention to personnel training 
programmes, the development of new products and ways to increase its sales and 
therefore its income.
(b)  Social environment
The social environment is governed by the demographics of the population and social  
and cultural variables. We can distinguish between the following demographic varia-
bles, all of which have an impact on the market.
Size and composition of the population
•	 Population growth: The size and composition of the market are directly influenced 
by the population growth of the country. When you consider the size of the 
population, remember that families have grown smaller over the past few years  
and consider what effect this will have on future markets. 
•	 Market composition: The market is made up of different ethnic groups. Each  
group has a distinctive culture and lifestyle. 
•	 Changing role of women: Women make up a large proportion of the labour force 
today. This has a direct impact on the market because the working woman has 
different needs from the homemaker. For instance, more working mothers mean a 
greater demand for crèches and nursery schools; families with two incomes have 
a higher disposable income; the clothing needs of the working woman differ from 
the homemaker; and finally, working women usually spend more money on time-
saving goods such as ready-made meals. 
•	 Life expectancy: Life expectancy has increased as a result of better medical services 
and healthier lifestyles. This means that there are many more customers over the age 
of 60, which presents definite marketing opportunities. For example, in the tourist 

Chapter 1: Basic business concepts and the business environment
17
industry there are many opportunities for travel agents to develop tour packages for 
this older target group. 
Geographic location 
Markets in metropolitan areas are larger and more concentrated, therefore a wider variety 
of products and services can be marketed and sold in and around cities. Urbanisation 
and the depopulation of rural areas have a direct influence on the distribution of the 
market. 
Development level of the market 
In South Africa today great emphasis is placed on training and consumer education. 
Customers are more informed, which means they know precisely what they want and 
therefore make greater demands on business. The customer is aware of, and stands up 
for, his or her rights. In order to continue to exist and grow, every business must focus 
on the needs of its customers. 
Other 
Social and cultural forces in the macro environment, which must be considered, include 
the following: 
•	 Changing awareness: The customer today is well informed about quality and avail-
able options. They are aware of environment concerns and consider such aspects as 
whether the manufacture of products contributes to pollution or uses scarce natural 
resources. 
•	 Time: In today’s busy world, the customer does not want to spend too much time 
shopping and will look for products that are convenient and save time. Some 
examples include portable laptop computers that can be used while travelling, 
or prepared foods as mentioned earlier. A further example is the appearance of 
convenience supermarkets in residential areas. People returning home from work 
want to be able to buy essentials as quickly as possible. The convenience and longer 
opening hours of smaller supermarkets in suburban areas satisfies this need. The 
same principle applies to one-stop shopping centres: everything the customer  
wants is available under one roof. 
•	 Healthier lifestyle: The current trend towards fitness and a healthier lifestyle is a 
further phenomenon that business must be aware of. There is greater demand for 
natural foods (foods without colouring agents or preservatives) and an increased 
demand for products linked to fitness, such as bicycles, running shoes and gym 
equipment. 
(c)  Technological environment 
The technological environment embraces numerous aspects that give rise to new 
products and services being made available on the market. The microwave oven, today 

18
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
a common convenience appliance in the average household, did not even exist 30 years 
ago. This product is the result of technological development and it has given many 
organisations the opportunity to add a new product to an existing product line. 
In the music industry, compact discs also constitute a new development which did not exist 
20 years ago. These days the compact discs are being replaced by the MP3 and MP4 digital 
formats that can be downloaded and distributed via digital platforms. 
New technological developments or improvements create definite opportunities for 
business, but they may also constitute certain threats. The development of compact discs  
meant that long-playing records are no longer manufactured. Factories that used to 
manufacture the latter have been forced to change their strategies because of develop-
ments on the technological front. Currently, record labels and producers are faced with 
new opportunities and threats of selling music through various digital channels. On 
one hand, there are many more opportunities to reach consumers, but on the other 
hand, there is the threat of piracy or illegal downloading. In addition, think of the 
continual changes in computer technology and the influence this has on banking, for 
example. New and technologically-improved products are constantly being introduced 
into the market.
If a business does not keep abreast of changes taking place on the technological front, 
it will soon find that the products it sells are obsolete. The consumer is not interested 
in obsolete products – organisations which do not keep abreast of technological change 
will have to relinquish their share of the market in the long term. A further influence 
of the technological environment on business is that provision should be made for 
research and development by means of funds allocated for this purpose. Technological 
changes do not always result in new products – they can also result in improvements  
to existing products. A good example of this is the cellphone industry.
(d)  Physical environment
The physical environment means the natural resources in the country and incorporates 
the total management of these resources. Natural resources include gold, coal, diamonds, 
water, natural forests, etc. The natural beauty of the country can be included as this influ-
ences the tourist market. The following variables in the physical environment should  
be taken into consideration:
Limited and expensive resources
The world’s natural resources are limited and must be managed carefully. Customers 
today demand that manufacturers recognise these limitations. This could also create 
opportunities in two ways:
•	 for the business to advertise its own environmentally friendly procedures and 
thereby attract customers
eg

Chapter 1: Basic business concepts and the business environment
19
•	 for business opportunities. 
Consider the following examples:
South Africa currently has problems with the supply of electricity. Many entrepreneurial 
opportunities arise from this – solar heating for water, power-saving light bulbs and wind 
generators etc.
South Africa has limited water supplies. Suggestions for entrepreneurial opportunities 
include sprinkler systems using recycled water and toilets with the two-flush option. 
Environmentalism and pollution
Industry is often guilty of air, water and noise pollution resulting from their manu-
facturing processes. The effects of this and the role played by industry in combating 
pollution are receiving worldwide attention.
Manufacturing businesses can play a role by considering such issues as packaging. 
Packaging in plastic or glass is very convenient, but has definite disadvantages for the 
environment.
From time to time poisonous waste products, which are extremely harmful to water 
and plant life, flow into rivers. The mining of minerals sometimes elicits strong oppo- 
sition from conservationists, for example the polemic regarding the mining of minerals 
in the St Lucia area. The construction of roads can mar the natural scenery, and 
conservationists were strongly opposed to the building of a tar road which would pass 
the Knysna lagoon in the southern Cape. 
(e)  Political and statutory environment 
The government of the day influences businesses through its fiscal and monetary 
policies. For instance, interest rates have a direct effect on net income, municipal rates 
affect property tax, and of course the annual budget influences the total economy of the 
country. The national budget is a useful document to study because it gives details of 
likely future government spending and of how income will be generated. Some of the 
government’s income is obtained from taxes paid by individuals and business. 
Variables which influence the individual business include the following: 
Statutory provisions 
There are various statutory provisions which businesses must comply with. For example:
•	 The business must have a trading license before it can do business.
•	 The business must register as a taxpayer at the local Receiver of Revenue.
•	 The Companies Act contains detailed prescriptions on how a company should be 
established and managed.
eg

20
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
•	 The business cannot conclude contracts unless it complies with the provisions of 
the closed contract. This means that the business is limited during the concluding of 
contracts by certain statutory provisions under contract law.
•	 Certain organisations, for example a restaurant, a home industry concern, or butch-
ery, must comply with certain health requirements as laid down by the relevant 
municipality. Such businesses must first obtain approval from the municipality 
before they can commence trading. Inspections are carried out on a regular basis to 
determine whether these organisations are complying with the necessary require-
ments.
There are also a variety of statutory provisions aimed at protecting the customer. 
•	 The regulations regarding advertising; advertising may not be misleading or contain 
false information. The Advertising Standards Association controls this aspect very 
strictly. 
•	 The customer must be properly informed about the product and its composition. 
This information is usually contained on the packaging. 
•	 The customer must be shown how to use the product, if applicable. For example, 
instructions for use must be included with all electrical products. 
•	 The customer must be properly informed about product safety requirements. 
•	 Product approval granted by the South African Bureau of Standards is aimed at 
protecting the consumer against inferior, poorly made and dangerous products.
Trade unions 
Every business has a responsibility towards its employees. There are various laws 
which help to maintain a smooth relationship between the employer and employee. 
Although statutory provisions and regulations protect the rights of the employee, the 
existence of trade unions is an important variable in the macro environment because 
the voice of individual employees can easily be ignored by management. 
Trade unions fight for the rights of workers who work in the same branch of industry. 
The employee acquires bargaining power through membership to the trade union which  
enables him or her to negotiate, for example, for higher salaries or better working 
conditions. In South Africa there are numerous trade unions, for example trade unions 
for mine workers, the motor industry, the steel industry and bank officials. If disputes 
are not resolved or are unfairly resolved, the Labour Relations Act of 1995 has made 
it possible to refer such cases to external mechanisms, such as the Commission for 
Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA). 

Chapter 1: Basic business concepts and the business environment
21
Associations and institutes 
In the same way as trade unions look after the interests of organised labour, many 
business associations and institutes campaign for the interests of businesses in their 
fields. Earlier on in this chapter we emphasised that a business has little, if any, influ-
ence over the macro environment. By means of associations and institutes, a business 
can promote its interests in the branch of industry in which it functions if it works with 
other businesses in the same branch of industry. 
The following institutes and associations are well known and active in the macro 
environment:
•	 Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut (AHI) 
•	 The South African Chamber of Business (Sacob) 
•	 The Chamber of Mines 
•	 The Motor Industries Federation 
•	 Black Management Forum.
(f)  International environment 
We have seen that the variables influencing individual businesses originate from the  
local sphere (the business itself) and the national sphere (the market and macro envi-
ronments). Over and above all these forces, the business must also still keep abreast 
of variables operating in the international sphere. These influences originate in the 
environment outside the country’s borders and include: 
International technology 
South Africa is technologically developed in certain areas such as in the fields of 
synthetic fuels, mining and veterinary science. However, South Africa also imports 
technology from other countries, for example computer technology from America and 
engineering technology from Germany and Japan. This phenomenon is common to all 
developing countries. 
International politics 
South Africa felt the effect of international politics with the trade sanctions imposed in 
the mid-eighties. The country did not have access to foreign loan capital, for example, 
and this had a negative effect on the economic growth rate and job creation. 
International economy 
Economic factors and variables such as interest rates, exchange rates, the gold price, the 
economic growth rate, inflation, the availability of capital and a scarcity of resources 
occur worldwide and influence the economic conditions of all countries. For example, 

22
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
think of the effect inflation has had on the economies of Zimbabwe, Russia and 
Argentina. Amongst other things, high inflation rates resulted in very high food prices 
in these countries. 
The rand–dollar and dollar–euro exchange rates have a significant influence on South 
African import and export activities. If the rand–dollar exchange rate is weak, the cost 
of importing goods becomes higher for a South African business. An example of this is 
the cost of overseas textbooks, which are currently expensive because the rand–dollar 
exchange rate is unfavourable for South African booksellers. 
1.5	
SUMMARY 
It is quite impossible for any business to function in total isolation. Without interaction 
with the business environment, your business will not continue to grow and may cease 
to exist. The management of a business should frequently analyse the environment and 
determine its general trends. This value information can be used to help the business 
achieve its objectives. Achieving the business objectives will remain a dream if this inter- 
action does not take place. 
The business must also use information to analyse trends in the market. From this 
information, you can analyse potential opportunities and threats. The business envi-
ronment offers opportunities which help you to achieve predetermined objectives. 
The opposite could also be true: if you do not heed important signals in the business 
environment, it could lead to the potential closure of your business. 
The three components of the business environment, identified as the micro, market and 
macro environments, are in constant interaction with each other and not independent 
of each other. Keep in mind that the various variables we have identified influence 
these environments and play a significant role in the growth and continued existence 
of the business. There is constant interaction between the different sub-environments.

INTRODUCTION 
Economic development can be directly attributed to the level of entrepreneurial activity 
in a country. In high-growth, globally competitive economies, the ability to nurture this 
entrepreneurial activity and grow businesses, create wealth and sustain competitive 
advantage is imperative. This is because there is a direct correlation between job creation 
and the level of entrepreneurial activity in an economy, as well as a positive, statistic-
ally signifi cant association between national economic growth and entrepreneurship. 
According to Kao (1993) entrepreneurial businesses ensure growth in the economy by 
doing something new and/or innovative to create wealth for the entrepreneur and to 
add value to society. 
The entrepreneur is ‘a person who undertakes a wealth-creating and value-adding process, 
through developing ideas, assembling resources and making things happen’ (Kao, Kao & 
Kao, 2002:42).

There are various definitions of an entrepreneur but one significant point is that entre-
preneurs are people with the ability to identify opportunities and create and grow 
a business. They are able to combine their creative ideas with the necessary skills, 
resources and people to form a successful business.
An entrepreneur can therefore be described as someone who:
•	 starts his or her own business
•	 manages his or her own business
•	 identifies new products or opportunities
•	 is creative and/or innovative
•	 organises and controls resources (such as capital, labour, materials) to ensure a profit
•	 has the ability and insight to market, produce and finance a service or product
•	 has financial means or who can obtain financing so as to realise the enterprise
•	 is willing to take calculated risks.
This summary of general capabilities clearly indicates the role of an entrepreneur in 
establishing and running a business.
It is important to keep in mind that not everyone who starts a new business is, in reality, 
an entrepreneur. Some might be enterprising but true entrepreneurs habitually create and 
innovate to build and grow something of recognised value. Not all small, medium and 
micro enterprises (SMMEs) achieve anything new or different, nor do they all grow and 
become successful. Thus, although small businesses contribute to wealth creation and 
add value to the economy, not all SMMEs are necessarily entrepreneurial.
Some researchers have estimated that, in South Africa, small and medium-sized enter-
prises make up 91% of formalised businesses, provide employment to about 60% of the 
labour force and total economic output accounts for roughly 34% of Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) (BASA, 2014).
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total production of a country. The total number of 
services and products supplied and produced within the borders of a country in one year 
are measured in financial terms by the GDP. The growth rate of GDP is an indication of how 
successful a country is in providing jobs and income to its citizens.  
In contrast, in the US, Japan and Germany, small businesses contribute more than 50% 
to the GDP in each country. In the United States (United States Census Bureau, 2012:501) 
D

Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
small and medium enterprises represented 99.7% of all employers accounting for 50% 
of employment in 2008. In the United Kingdom 99% of all businesses were small and 
medium enterprises, responsible for 60% of total employment in 2009 (Department of 
Business, Innovation and Skills, 2010).
In developing countries small and medium enterprises are also playing increasingly 
important roles in their contribution to their economies. For instance, in China SMEs  
has increased from no privately-owned SMEs in 1979 to being responsible for 80% 
of total employment by 1999 (Anderson, Li, Harrison and Robson, 2003:310). This 
statement is supported by the National Bureau of Statistics of China (2008:13-1) that 
indicates that small and medium enterprises accounted for 77% of total employment in 
China in 2007. Ninety five percent of all enterprises in India were classified as small and 
medium enterprises and accounted for 45% of total employment in 2006 (Pandey, 2007). 
In New Zealand small and medium enterprises were responsible for 59% of all new jobs 
in the economy (Ministry of Economic Development, 2010:16). 
2.3	
THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ENTREPRENEURSHIP 
	
AND SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
Most businesses begin as small or micro enterprises and are usually managed by one 
person. The aim of that person is to grow the business. This can happen continuously 
as long as the entrepreneur retains his or her entrepreneurial mind-set (i.e. continues to 
innovate and create). However, if the entrepreneur becomes comfortable and satisfied 
with the level of growth within the enterprise, he or she stops being an entrepreneur 
and becomes a small business manager, who is risk-, change- and innovation-averse. 
Schumpeter (1934) observes that most firms settle for this non-entrepreneurial stability, 
and Gray (2002) confirms this low intention to grow in most small businesses.
Examples of small business managers who are not entrepreneurs are:
•	 a person who manages an existing business or franchise without ensuring growth
•	 a person who inherits a business and runs it in the same way as his or her predecessor
•	 a person who is appointed by the owner of a small business as manager.
A longitudinal study on the SME Growth Index by the Small Business Project (SBP) 
identified three sectors that have high-growth potential namely business services firms 
showing the largest growth, followed by manufacturers and tourism operators (SBP, 
2013:9). 
Thus although some businesses do not show an intention to grow, there are many that 
do and these are the entrepreneurial firms.
eg

Chapter 2: Entrepreneurship and small, medium and micro entrerprises (SMMEs) in perspective
27
There is a certain danger at this point in the business’s development. Even though 
the entrepreneur may have good ideas and be competent, he or she may not have the 
necessary skills to manage a small business. This lack of managerial skills could cause 
the business to fail. To be successful, the small business manager must be able to:
•	 plan, organise, lead and control the various business functions
•	 organise the efficient operation of tasks
•	 ensure interpersonal and intergroup competence
•	 facilitate formal communication during scheduled meetings 
•	 compile and implement necessary policies and procedures for the business. 
2.4	
TYPES OF ENTREPRENEURIAL BUSINESSES 
Entrepreneurial businesses can be classified as either informal, micro, very small, small, 
medium or large. Each type of business has very specific characteristics with specific 
needs and features. We will discuss some of these in the following section. 
The National Small Business Amendment Act (No. 26 of 2003) has set out criteria defi-
ning business size in each sector of industry (see Table 2.1). 
2.4.1	 The formal small business 
The small and micro business sector 
In the National Small Business Amendment Act of South Africa (No. 26 of 2003) a micro 
business is defined as a business with five or fewer employees and a turnover of up to 
R100 000. A very small business employs between one and ten employees, and a small 
business between 11 and 50 employees. The upper limit for turnover in a small business 
varies between R3 million in the agricultural sector to R13 million in the manufacturing 
and catering, accommodation and other trade sectors, with a maximum of R32 million 
in the wholesale trade sector. The upper limits for employment and turnover in the 
various sectors are indicated in Table 2.1.

Successful entrepreneurs provide inspiration and act as role models. We have all heard 
of exceptional entrepreneurs such as Bill Gates and Mark Shuttleworth, but there are 
many lesser-known people with whom we can more easily associate.
Examples of successful entrepreneurs can be found in all sectors of the economy, and 
vary from micro businesses in basic products and services to sophisticated IT companies 
and highly professional practices, with all types of creative, entrepreneurial businesses 
in between. Here are some examples in the small business category.
Provençal is an entrepreneurial concern in the catering, accommodation and other trade 
sector. Two friends, Jacques le Roux and Chantelle de Villiers, established a catering business 
with R5 000 as an entrepreneurship assignment in their hospitality degree programme in 
2010. After less than two years, they had achieved a turnover of R200 000 per month. They 
now cater for functions and weddings and also offer special French cooking classes. In 2012 
they opened a restaurant specialising in French Provençal cuisine.
Ezabantu Fishing is another inspirational micro enterprise that grew to become a successful 
small business. It began because the owner, Bulelwa Qupe, couldn’t find enough fish for her
➠
eg

29
fish and chips shop. She acquired a fishing quota, began fishing, and soon had too much 
fish for her own needs. This prompted her to establish her own export company, Buntu 
Marketing and Exporting, which exports white hake to Spain and abalone to Asia.
Hazel Food Market was established by Retha van Hoven when she became a mother and 
decided that she wanted to spend more time with her children. Years in corporate life 
that included frequent international travel and visits to France exposed her to vibrant and 
beautiful food markets in France. She identified a venue and started to look around for 
vendors with specialist food products because the focus of the market is to offer something 
different. Initially the market started off with 37 vendors that grew to 70 over a four-year 
period.
Vendors have to apply formally and once approved and allocated a space are charged R280 
per stall per Saturday (as of July 2014). They have to provide their own table and gazebos 
and are responsible for their own displays. 
The business of operating the Hazel Food Market is time intensive, especially over weekends, 
as well as the administration during the week but it has enabled Retha to spend time with 
her children. In addition she has enabled many other small business owners to market their 
businesses and products.
Decorex, South Africa’s international interior decorating showcase, was started with a few 
hundred rand by Nicola Hadfield ten years ago. She first approached Decorex in London to 
start a similar show in South Africa, but they regarded South Africa as too Third World for 
a decorating show of the calibre of Decorex. She decided to proceed on her own and the 
show has become a huge success. After eight successful years in operation, Nicola sold 
the show to a Dutch company so that she can pursue new business opportunities. She is a 
typical ‘habitual’ entrepreneur. 
Andre and Gary Shearer established Cape Classics Inc. in 1992. It began as a small wine 
export company in Cape Town and has developed into two separate award-winning 
companies: Cape Classics Export based in Cape Town and Cape Classics Inc. based in New 
York. They achieved this success in only ten years. 
The Shearer brothers attribute their success to perseverence, knowledge of basic business 
principles, the quality of their products and the excellent service they provide. .
2.5	
CORPORATE ENTREPRENEURSHIP 
Corporate entrepreneurship (or intrapreneurship) is also a form of entrepreneurship. 
Intrapreneurship is when a new business is created within an existing business but with 
products or services different from the original business. The corporate entrepreneur 
identifies a specific business opportunity and establishes a new business within an 
existing business. 

30
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
Corporate entrepreneurship (intrapreneurship) is the creation of a business or businesses 
within an existing larger business, by using new ideas and opportunities. The new and 
relatively small autonomous business unit produces a product or service using the resources 
of an existing business.   
Corporate entrepreneurship makes it possible for large businesses to adapt to changes 
in the market entrepreneurially, to experiment in the market, to diversify from the 
core business, to establish new distribution channels and to make profits from new 
businesses.
An example of corporate entrepreneurship is First National Bank (FNB), which used to be a 
conventional bank only. Subsequently FNB ventured into new businesses such as Outsurance 
and Discovery Health. Outsurance is a short-term insurance company and a diversification 
of FNB’s core business. When Outsurance was established, it was different in that it offered 
direct, short-term insurance to individuals without the traditional intermediary insurance 
brokers. Outsurance has grown from a small corporate entrepreneurial business to a large 
insurance business.
2.5.1	 Franchisors and franchisees
Franchising is an arrangement whereby one person or business (the franchisor) grants 
an independent party (the franchisee) the right to sell the business’s products or services 
according to guidelines set down by the franchisor. The franchisor retains control over the 
conduct of the business and offers the franchisee a comprehensive business package. 
Examples of franchisors are Steers restaurants and Blockbusters video shops.   
The franchisor is an entrepreneur, whereas the franchisee should rather be seen as a 
corporate entrepreneur (or intrapreneur) possibly initiating innovative ideas within the 
franchise system.
Franchisees do not have the freedom to experiment, operate and market their 
business based on their own vision of how things should be done but must adhere 
to the plans of the franchisor. However, a study has proved that franchisees do show 
an entrepreneurial orientation in certain situations, such as multiple-unit franchisees 
(Maritz, 2005). Franchisors in many sectors have recognised the benefit of multiple-unit 
franchisees (Johnson, 2004) and this is seen as an entrepreneurial continuation of the 
franchise trend.
Franchisors usually fall into the medium to large business category, as the more 
successful franchisors manage a large number of franchises apart from the overall 
management of the franchise group.

Franchisees can fall anywhere between the small to medium categories.
Kobus Oosthuizen started a bakery franchise called Butterfi eld Bakery. Kobus’s franchise 
operation now has more than 120 franchisees. What is different about Butterfi eld Bakery 
outlets is that they have a defi ned market and are situated close to their target markets 
(mines and other areas inadequately serviced by traditional or in-house bakeries). The 
combined turnover of these franchises is more than R300 million per annum.
More familiar to the public is Nando’s. This franchise was started in the south of Johannesburg 
in 1987 by Robert Brozin and Fernando Duarte as a fast-food shop selling spicy, grilled 
chicken meals. In 2014 there were approximately 1 000 Nando’s worldwide, operating in 24 
different countries including Mauritius, Botswana, Namibia, Australia, New Zealand, India, 
Singapore, United Kingdom, United States and Canada. In 2012 the turnover of Nando’s 
exceeded $650 million (or R6 500 million).
2.6 
KEY SUCCESS FACTORS OF ENTREPRENEURS
Entrepreneurs possess particular characteristics that set them apart. This does not mean 
that all entrepreneurs have the same characteristics or combination of characteristics. 
Some entrepreneurs are successful because they are prepared to take chances, while 
others achieve their goals largely as a result of their innovative skills and fl air for man-
agement. Each entrepreneur has a unique combination of factors at his or her disposal 
for achieving success. In fact, research has shown that there is no typical entrepreneur 
because few, if any, entrepreneurs possess all of the characteristics or skills we will 
discuss.
The following fi gure summarises the key success factors that usually contribute to 
successful entrepreneurship.

Figure 2.1: Key success factors 
As an entrepreneur, it is important for you to analyse your personal strengths and 
weaknesses. Strengths can then be positively applied and weaknesses can be addressed 
by one or more of the following:
• personal development
eg

32
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
•	 attending courses
•	 appointing staff and/or experts to compensate where needed.
2.6.1	 The skills, expertise and aptitudes of an entrepreneur
Successful entrepreneurs have particular skills, expertise and aptitudes that can be 
applied profitably in any business. It is best to start or run a business with something 
you feel comfortable with and know a lot about (expertise) and/or in which you are 
skilled. The match between you, as the person starting the business, and the type of 
business is therefore most important.
Skills usually refer to manual work and can be learned. You can learn to become, for 
example, an electrician, a hairdresser or cabinet-maker.
Expertise is based on knowledge you acquire. Expertise and knowledge are obtained by 
studying and/or experience. There are experts in fields such as taxation, computer systems 
and study techniques for example.
Each person is also born with aptitudes and talents. Some are artistic, some have a talent 
for communicating, and others have a flair with figures.   
Usually, your skills, expertise and knowledge are a product of your natural aptitudes, 
talents and interests. Someone who has a strong verbal aptitude, for example, will 
learn languages easily and so develop a sound knowledge of languages with further 
study. People who are artistic can practice art as a career or a hobby. They could, for 
example paint or be a graphic designer. Further study would enable them to qualify as 
an architect or jewellery designer.
The following are examples of ways in which an entrepreneur can use his or 
her aptitudes, expertise and skills in specific businesses.

•	 Develops methods of stock for 
enterprises
•	 Provides central distribution suppliers 
of books to retail shops
You can see how important it is for an entrepreneur to consider his or her skills, 
expertise and aptitudes when planning to start a business.
2.6.2	 The important personal characteristics of entrepreneurs 
Before we discuss the personal characteristics, you should note that expertise, skills 
and aptitudes in isolation do not guarantee a successful enterprise. To ensure success in 
your own enterprise, business aptitude and management skills are indispensable. The 
following example highlights the range of skills necessary to manage an interior design 
business. 
A successful interior decorator must have a thorough knowledge of materials, furniture 
styles and the use of space. Knowledge of various manufacturers and their products and 
services is also essential. Such a person must also be artistic and creative, with a feel 
for colour and dimensions to be able to furnish a room tastefully. These are the person’s 
expertise and talents. The interior decorator must also maintain sound human relations, 
because she will deal with many different people (clients, employees, suppliers and the 
public) when the business is marketed. 
Involvement in the business ensures that the entrepreneur will use her expertise and talents 
to offer clients the best possible service. This in turn ensures the success of the business.
Here now are the personal characteristics that warrant attention. 
eg

34
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
(a)  Perseverence 
Entrepreneurs have confidence in themselves and their businesses and carry on in 
spite of setbacks, difficult situations and problems. They are able to take immediate 
decisions, but can also exercise patience until a task has been completed and a goal 
reached. They do not lose heart when they make mistakes or fail. 
Successful entrepreneurs have an intense determination and a need to overcome 
obstacles, solve problems and complete a task. They are not intimidated by difficult 
situations. 
(b)  Commitment to the business 
Entrepreneurs dedicate all their skills, expertise and resources to establishing and 
building the business. They prove their commitment by: 
•	 using their own money to establish the business 
•	 taking a mortgage on a house 
•	 working long hours in order to succeed 
•	 accepting a lower standard of living and possibly earning little or no income from 
the business until it is successful. 
(c)  Involvement in the business 
Entrepreneurs are personally involved in their business and are aware of everything 
that is happening on all levels and in all sections of the business. They perform tasks 
themselves and communicate well with staff and others involved with the business, 
such as suppliers and clients. The example of the interior decorator reminds us of the 
importance of personal involvement.
(d)  Willingness to take risks 
Entrepreneurs take calculated risks. This means that the risk related to a business 
opportunity must not be too great, for then the chance of success is not in the hands 
of the entrepreneur. They are not gamblers. The level of risk should not be too low 
either, as then exploiting the opportunity does not pose a challenge and is usually 
not as profitable. A risk factor that is too low implies limited profitability. A business 
opportunity with a low risk factor makes it easy to enter the market, but also raises the 
likelihood of competition. In the business world this consideration is called ‘barriers to 
entry’. 
Entrepreneurs usually try to reduce risk by finding investors to provide finance, making 
arrangements with suppliers to provide goods on consignment or persuading suppliers 
to accept special terms of payment, etc. 

Chapter 2: Entrepreneurship and small, medium and micro entrerprises (SMMEs) in perspective
35
The successful entrepreneur will carefully plan and consider each business opportunity. 
(e)  Sound human relations 
Entrepreneurs work closely with other people. They realise they cannot be successful 
in isolation and therefore motivate their employees and know how to build contacts to 
benefit their businesses. They know it is important to ensure long-term relationships 
and stay on good terms with suppliers, clients and others involved in the business. 
Successful entrepreneurs realise the importance of business relationships. They have 
good relations with clients, see human relations as an important resource of the enterprise 
and regard long-term goodwill as more important than short-term benefits. Sound 
human relations has been identified as one factor that differentiates the ‘successful’ 
entrepreneur from the ‘average’ in developing countries (McClelland, 1986). 
Successful as well as average entrepreneurs maintain good personal relations by, for 
example, using influencing strategies to develop business contacts and influential peo-
ple to achieve their goals. They are able to persuade people to buy a product or service 
or to provide financing. They also make use of their capabilities, reliability and other 
personal or business qualities (McClelland, 1986).
(f)  Creativity and innovative ability
Creativity refers to a person’s imagination and ability to think creatively. Creativity is 
the generation of new and useable ideas to solve any problem or use any opportunity. In 
the long term, an enterprise’s success is determined by the degree to which good ideas 
are generated, developed and implemented. Creativity consists of people being open 
to new ideas and new approaches to the business and focussing on what can be done 
differently to ensure success in the business. In other words, effective entrepreneurs 
take the initiative to solve problems in a unique manner.
Innovative ability refers more to the use of creative abilities to create something concrete. 
So it is logical that creative thinking, but especially innovative ability, is fundamental to 
starting a new enterprise.
Creativity distinguishes an entrepreneur from his or her competitors. Often it does not 
represent a radically new method, but it may be a method that satisfies a customer’s 
need in a better way.
(g)  Positive attitude and approach
Entrepreneurs learn from their setbacks and failures. They are realistic and accept that 
disappointments are inevitable, and are not discouraged when these occur. They are 
able to identify opportunities even in adverse and difficult situations.
All this indicates that entrepreneurs remain positive despite setbacks, failure and dis-
appointment. This does not mean they do not sometimes feel dispirited when events 

36
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
are not favourable, but on the whole they deal positively with situations. We often read 
of entrepreneurs who have lost everything, sometimes more than once, only to start 
afresh. Success is achieved by using negative experiences positively and by learning 
from past mistakes.
In this way, Henry Ford, father of the motor car assembly line and the fi rst mass-produced 
motor car (the Model-T Ford), twice started enterprises (both times building racing cars) 
that proved unsuccessful, before achieving success.
2.6.3 The important functional management skills of entrepreneurs
The management skills of an entrepreneur are an indication of how well the entrepre-
neur can perform important tasks or activities in a business. Related activities are 
grouped and are known as the eight functions of a business. They are shown in Figure 2.2.
The functions are described in more detail in Chapter 1, section 1.4.1, pages 8 and 9 
where they are applied as part of setting up a business.
In this section, which is about you, the entrepreneur, we discuss your ability to perform 
specifi c activities in the enterprise. You must be aware of your strengths and weaknesses 
in terms of management skills in the various business functions so that you can apply 
or supplement them to build a successful enterprise.

If you think back to the example of the interior decorator, it is evident that the success 
of a business demands specifi c management skills.
eg

Chapter 2: Entrepreneurship and small, medium and micro entrerprises (SMMEs) in perspective
37
The interior decorator must be market oriented. She must know which target market is to 
be served, for example:
•	 the higher income group or corporate clients
•	 people with modern, traditional or alternative tastes.
The interior decorator must also be familiar with marketing methods and know how to 
reach the target market. Managing and applying the income and funds is equally essential 
for the survival and profitability of the business. If the interior decorator cannot manage her 
finances, she will have to get expert assistance.
According to management consultants, marketing and management expertise are 
essential for the successful operation of SMMEs. To be successful, the entrepreneur 
should have a minimum or a particular combination of these management skills.
The following important aspects of management skills will be discussed below:
(a) 	planning a business before it is established
(b) 	general management skills and the use of advisers
(c) 	customer service
(d) 	knowledge of competitors
(e) 	market orientation
(f) 	 importance of quality products or services
(g) 	accounting for your own purposes
(h) 	insight into expenditure, income, profit and loss
(i)  	ability to use income wisely.
(a)  Planning a business before it is established
This activity is part of the general management function and is part of drawing up the 
business plan. A well-considered business plan ensures that the business is launched 
with confidence, because it means the necessary research and planning has been done.
Entrepreneurs often do the planning very informally because there is no time to draw 
up a formal business plan, or because they simply do not know how to do it. Despite 
their informal planning, these entrepreneurs can be successful.
eg
NB

38
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
Formal planning and drawing up a business plan are desirable activities because they 
enable the entrepreneur to: 
•	 identify problems early on so that he or she can make wise decisions and fewer mistakes 
•	 consider all the important factors concerning the intended business and in so doing 
become less dependent on purely instinctive or crisis decisions, thereby avoiding stress 
•	 take decisions for the future 
•	 use this planning stage as an ideal opportunity for testing ideas.
A full discussion of, and guidance in, developing a business plan is given in Chapter 5. 
(b)  General management skills and the use of advisers 
This activity is also part of the general management function. 
Entrepreneurs must know what is needed for success in a specific business, and must be 
intent on developing their skills in these critical areas of performance. If marketing the 
business’s products is the critical area of performance, and significantly determines the 
success of the enterprise, the entrepreneur must know how to carry out this function. If 
they do not have the necessary expertise themselves, they should appoint trained staff. 
They should also understand the environment in which they are competing and be 
well-organised. Know-how is often more important than creativity. 
As an entrepreneur, it is logical that you will start a business in which you can use your 
expertise and skills (strengths). You will also usually be aware of, or soon discover, your 
weaknesses. Once you are aware of these, you can then strengthen or supplement your 
weak areas by: 
•	 using other people, such as employees, consultants, contractors or professional 
experts 
•	 working on your self-development and making conscious efforts to make up for 
deficiencies by learning from others, attending courses, reading or studying. 
The interior decorator knows that she is a very creative, artistic and stylish person. She 
realises that her financial knowledge is insufficient for her to do her own accounting and 
so contracts this duty out to an accountant. As a good businesswoman she accepts that 
she must be able to understand financial statements and so takes a course to learn basic 
financial terms and principles to be able to take proper business decisions. She has identified 
her weaknesses, and is taking steps to avoid harming her enterprise with them.

(c)  Customer service
This activity is included in the marketing and administrative functions.
Entrepreneurs who maintain good human relations are sensitive to customers’ needs 
and so provide very good customer service. Examples are after-sales service; attention 
to details, such as serving refreshments when a client visits, personal presentability and 
attractive premises; user-friendliness, such as a neatly ordered shop and clear instruc-
tions on using products. Clients remember, support and recommend a business that 
meets their needs and gives them something extra without making them feel they are 
paying for it. Little gestures mean a lot: a balloon or sticker for the child; a cup of tea 
or glass of champagne in the jewellery store; changing an order on short notice; or just 
friendly, helpful service goes a long way.
Administrative and technical factors are also crucial to sound customer service. Keep 
accurate records and an up-to-date filing system for reference and stock control. Use a 
diary so that you can plan your time and keep appointments and job cards for client 
information. These are a few examples of methods to ensure effective customer service.
(d)  Knowledge of competitors
This activity is also part of the marketing function.
Successful entrepreneurs know:
•	 who their competitors are
•	 how many competitors they have
•	 what size their competitors’ operations are
•	 which segment of the market their competitors control
•	 what the quality of their competitors’ products or services are
•	 how to distinguish themselves from their competitors and so ensure to increase 
their share of the market
•	 how to discover their competitors’ strengths and weaknesses, and to convert a 
competitor’s weakness into an opportunity for their own business.
An entrepreneur sells Persian carpets and kilims. He knows his competitors and distinguishes 
his business by visiting clients at home or at work. He takes along a variety of suitable 
carpets and cloths to make the client’s choice easier. His professional know-how concerning 
the quality of his product and his taste and flair for colour (talent!) are presented to the 
client in a unique fashion. He is successful because his competitors sell their products from 
their shops or at auctions, with no apparent interest in the client’s home or place of work.

(e)  Market orientation
This activity is also part of the marketing function.
Successful entrepreneurs are market-oriented. They know who their target market is, 
what the demands and needs of the target market are and how to meet them profitably. 
The example of the interior decorator illustrates this functional skill. A market-conscious 
entrepreneur has developed products and services to satisfy the client’s requirements.
A market-conscious entrepreneur is positioned realistically towards competitors. This 
means that the entrepreneur’s products and/or services are distinct from those of com-
petitors to ensure profitability and a competitive edge. The customer is the focus of the 
business and products and/or services are developed and adapted to meet the client’s 
desires.
Product-oriented entrepreneurs often have problems because they are more concerned 
with the product than with the client, and consequently don’t know how to market 
their products/services successfully.
The following quotation should serve as a warning to entrepreneurs.
‘Many aspiring entrepreneurs are so in love with their product/service idea that they ignore 
the market; they assume it will sell. The market road is strewn with product/service ideas 
that were heavily – and many times cleverly – advertised and went bust’ (Burch, 1986:79).
(f)  The importance of quality products or services
This activity is part of the marketing function as well as the purchasing function.
Quality products are not necessarily expensive products. However, the client expects 
the quality of the product to be in keeping with the price charged.
Value for money is important. A successful entrepreneur aims to offer clients a quality 
product while still remaining profitable. Costs must be kept in check without affecting 
the quality of goods. Quality products and services contribute to marketing, as they 
generate new clients through personal recommendations from existing, satisfied clients. 
(g)  Accounting for your own purposes 
This activity is part of the administrative and financial function. 
Successful entrepreneurs realise that they must be able to understand their own 
accounting systems. Simplicity and usefulness are the most important features of such 
systems. 
A simple system that suits the business is essential. The entrepreneur must understand 
what has to be done and why it must be done so that the information it provides 
NB

Chapter 2: Entrepreneurship and small, medium and micro entrerprises (SMMEs) in perspective
41
can be properly utilised. If the size and complexity of an enterprise are such that the 
accounting cannot be done internally, a qualified person must be appointed to perform 
this function. The usefulness of the information provided by the accounting system is 
of cardinal importance because it allows the entrepreneur to make decisions on how to 
improve the management of the enterprise. 
(h)  Insight into expenditure, income, profit and loss 
This activity is part of the financial function. 
Successful entrepreneurs distinguish between income and profit. They realise that 
income must first be used to buy new stocks, to pay creditors, wages, salaries, tax and 
for current expenses. Only once this has been done can the entrepreneur determine 
what portion of the remaining income or profit can be ploughed back into the business 
and how much can be used for personal remuneration. The entrepreneur knows how to 
calculate profit and what it means to show a loss. He or she must know which costs are 
essential and understand the implication of increased expenses. This management skill 
is closely related to the next skill, namely the ability to use income wisely. 
(i)  The ability to use income wisely 
This activity is also part of the financial function. We discussed this management skill 
in the example of the interior decorator. 
The successful entrepreneur exercises financial discipline and understands what to 
spend money on to ensure success. An expensive motor car conveys an image of success, 
or may offer convenience to a client. If this is important to the business, the entrepreneur 
may take the risk of buying the car. On the other hand, a successful entrepreneur will 
not waste money on unnecessary personal luxuries and status symbols. 
Entrepreneurs must constantly take decisions on expenses. They must develop the 
ability to make the right decisions to ensure growth of their business. 
Examples of good decisions are:
•	 postponing the payment to a debt/creditor for as long as possible to keep cash available 
for a special offer on necessary stocks, which will enhance profitability 
•	 applying profits within the business instead of on holidays, luxuries or a more expensive 
house 
•	 using money wisely in departments or on products that will result in the greatest 
profitability for the enterprise. 
Remember that although all management skills are important few, if any, entrepreneurs 
have all the management skills necessary to run a successful business.

DEALING WITH EXTERNAL FACTORS THAT AFFECT 
	
ENTREPRENEURSHIP 
External factors and circumstances also influence the way an entrepreneur will be able 
to exploit his or her potential. How you accommodate, deal with and even exploit 
external factors to your personal advantage is a measure of your entrepreneurship. 
As an entrepreneur you must be aware of the following external factors:
Economic conditions
The entrepreneur must know how to adapt to 
fluctuating interest rates or declining levels of 
customer spending power.
Technological changes
The entrepreneur must keep up with 
technological developments and know how to 
exploit them to the benefit of his or her business.
Social and cultural forces
The entrepreneur must be able to identify 
opportunities for growth in market share 
following a rise in levels of education among 
large sections of the population.
Political and legislative 
variables
The entrepreneur must realise the opportunities 
that arise after political adjustments and events.
Physical variables
The entrepreneur must keep abreast of the 
availability and price of resources, such as 
considering the use of alternative raw materials 
following price rises.
International forces
The entrepreneur who uses technologically 
advanced communication channels can, for 
example, expand to and even establish a business 
in another country.
These external factors are discussed fully in Chapter 1. 
Skills, expertise, aptitude, personal characteristics and management skills determine 
the way a person will handle external factors. The relationship between a person’s 
inherent attributes and external factors are crucial to successful entrepreneurship.

SUMMARY 
The importance of entrepreneurial business at all levels is essential to a country’s  
economic development, wealth and employment creation. To a large extent this is

dependent on the entrepreneur, who applies certain talents, skills and expertise in the 
start-up, development and growth of businesses. Entrepreneurial development is the 
origin of successful entrepreneurial activity and, although some are born entrepreneurs, 
it is possible to develop individuals to become entrepreneurs. This is where entrepre-
neurial education and training plays an important role. 
All the success factors that have been discussed must be analysed in personal terms. 
This may discourage some potential entrepreneurs, but it is vital that the aspiring busi-
nessperson be aware of all the important aspects. Remember that a successful entrepre-
neur is critical of him- or herself, but positive about solving problems. The entrepreneur 
will therefore see which adjustments must be made or what can be done to start an 
enterprise that has been a dream. Thus the entrepreneur has a vision. He or she realises 
that it is essential to evaluate personal strengths and weaknesses realistically to achieve 
the goals. 
Self-evaluation questions 
1.	
Describe the entrepreneur and indicate how the entrepreneur differs from a 
small business manager.

Chapter
3.1 LEARNING OUTCOMES 
After you have studied this chapter, you should be able to: 
• identify the stages of setting up a business 
• defi ne creativity 
• determine your own level of creativity 
• improve the creativity of a team by using various creativity techniques 
• creatively generate business ideas using structured methods/techniques 
• distinguish between non-feasible and feasible ideas 
• develop and refi ne a business idea. 
An example of a feasible business idea 
Braaing is not just a cooking method, it’s a lifestyle and a massive part of the South African 
heritage. There is even a day dedicated to it – the public holiday known as Heritage/Braai 
Day on 24 September every year. Braaishop™ South Africa is a private company that was 
incorporated in March 2013 and is 100% wholly PDI (Previously Disadvantaged Individuals) 
owned. It is chaired, directed and steered by Robyn Boake, who is assisted by her husband, 
Barry, with Dad (Tony) as their primary shopkeeper.
Braaishop™ is not your average retailer, but rather a specialty store bringing the very best of 
all things braai directly to the consumer. They actively hunt for new and innovative products, 
while offering the widest range of proven braai’s and braai equipment and spares. Their 
motto: ‘if you can braai on, in or with it, we have it’, and ‘if we don’t already, we’ll scour the 
planet to fi nd it for you – or have it custom built to suit your requirement perfectly’.

Their pilot physical shop in Fontainebleau, Randburg, opened its doors on 1 June 2013 and 
every day they learn valuable lessons in this unique business niche. The shop not only serves 
as a test platform, but it’s also the engine that they use to continuously tweak and fine-tune 
their business model. It’s impossible for them to offer every item they offer online in the 
shop – this would negatively impact their costing and efficiency model – but it does give 
them a platform to mingle with people who love braaing as much as they do, and show off 
the coolest gadgets available. They accept orders for items not in stock off-catalogue, and 
generally have these ready for collection or dispatched by courier or Post Office within a day 
or two from the order being placed.
3.2	
INTRODUCTION 
Setting up a business can be divided into three main stages, namely:  
•	 the identification of feasible business ideas (the idea stage) 
•	 the investigation of the profitability of the feasible idea (the viability study), and the 
drawing up of a business plan (the planning stage) 
•	 the implementation of the feasible and viable business idea (the implementation 
stage). 
Figure 3.1 on the next page illustrates this three-stage process. 
These three stages form the theme of the rest of the book. In this chapter we will discuss 
the first stage, namely the identification of feasible business ideas. Chapters 4 and 5 deal 
with the planning stage and Chapter 6 looks at the implementation stage. 
The identification of business ideas is a creative process. As a potential entrepreneur, 
you must therefore be able to assume a creative attitude. All of us have the potential to 
think creatively. In this chapter you will be introduced to certain techniques which can 
be used to improve your creative mind-set. 
Although it is important to think of as many business ideas as possible, only one idea 
can eventually be converted to a business enterprise. This chapter will help you to 
identify a suitable idea (i.e. a feasible business idea).
3.3	
CULTIVATING A CREATIVE ATTITUDE 
Chapter 2 explained that the capacity to act creatively and innovatively is one of the 
personality traits of an entrepreneur (turn back to page 35). Although a new and 
innovative business idea can be very satisfying, it can be very difficult to establish 
because it is not always easy to be first with a new product or service. When you are 
first, you must convince people that there is a need for your product or service. On the

other hand, being second or third means that you can learn from the mistakes of others 
who went before you.

This does not, however, imply that you should imitate others directly and offer the 
market something identical. As an entrepreneur, you should try to provide specialised 
or exceptional products or services. You must think, therefore, of an idea(s) that will 
distinguish you from other competitive businesses. To do this, you must think and act 
creatively.

3.3.1	 What is creativity? 
Being creative is recognising the same thing as everybody else but thinking of a different 
way of dealing with it.   
In order to be creative, you need to be able to view things in new ways or from different 
perspectives. Among other things, you need to be able to generate new possibilities or 
new alternatives. Tests of creativity measure not only the number of alternatives that 
can be generated but the uniqueness of those alternatives. 
3.3.2	 Am I creative? 
How do we recognise creativity? Think of half a dozen people you believe to be creative 
– whether people you know or perhaps famous South African inventors such as Mark 
Shuttleworth, who invented an electronic security system, and Chris Barnard, who 
developed surgical procedures for organ transplants, invented new heart valves and 
performed the first human heart transplant. 
What characteristics or abilities do these people have in common that make them 
creative? Note down a dozen characteristics they all share. Obvious abilities with which 
you could start your list might include:
•	 solving problems in different ways 
•	 thinking imaginatively 
•	 seeing possibilities others have not seen 
•	 initiating change. 
The creative person usually enjoys problem-solving and tends to bring fresh perspectives 
to old problems. Here are some fun problems to stimulate creativity. 
Question: You are participating in a race. You overtake the second person. What position 
are you in?
Answer: If you answered that you are first, then you are absolutely wrong! If you overtake 
the second person and you take his place, you are second!
Question: If you overtake the last person, then you are…?
Answer: If you answered that you are second to last, then you are wrong again. Explain 
how you can overtake the last person?

Answer: There is often more than one right answer to a problem. This problem can be 
solved in, among others, the following ways: 
•	 If you take a thick pencil, you could join the dots with just three lines.
•	 If you take a very thick pencil, you can do the job with just one line!
•	 By rolling the paper into a cylinder, you could draw one long line which encircles the 
cylinder.
•	 You can fold the paper in three, so the rows of dots all line up, and fold it again and 
poke the pencil through.

Answer:

Chapter 3: The identification of feasible business ideas
51
Creative thought can be divided into divergent and convergent reasoning. 
Divergent thinking is the intellectual ability to think of many original, diverse and elaborate 
ideas. 
Convergent thinking is the intellectual ability to logically evaluate, critique and choose the 
best idea from a selection of ideas.   
Both of these abilities are necessary for creative output. Divergent thinking is essential 
to the novelty of creative products, whereas convergent thinking is fundamental to the 
appropriateness. 
Research has shown that divergent (creative) thinking is natural for right brain-
dominant people, whereas convergent (logical) thinking is natural for left brain-
dominant people. The right brain processes data in a rapid, complex, whole-pattern 
and perceptual manner, while the left brain operates in a more verbal, analytical mode. 
Brain hemispheric dominance can therefore be an indication of creative ability. Why 
don’t you test your brain dominance with one or more of the online brain dominance 
tests? Try the one at www.puzzle.dse.nl/tests/index_us.html. 
Although some people are born with the gift of creativity, it is possible for all of us to 
develop and improve our creative abilities. It is important to understand that creativity 
is just as much an attitude as a manner of thinking. It is thus possible to think of new 
ideas by attuning yourself to creativity. Use the following methods to improve your 
creativity:
(a) 	Actively seek ideas: You can learn to seek ideas actively by judging everything that 
you read or observe on the strength of the ideas that can be developed from it. If you 
think in this way regularly, it will become a habit and ideas will come to you more 
easily. 
(b) 	Write your ideas down: Make a habit of writing down an idea as soon as you have 
one, even if you feel it is not a good idea. Regularly read through your ideas. This 
will give you the opportunity to review them and perhaps combine them in a new 
concept. 
(c) 	View a topic from another person’s perspective/point of view: Put yourself in 
somebody else’s position to get a different perspective on a topic. With a better un-
derstanding of other people’s points of view, you will gain new insights and ideas. 
By asking yourself, for example, what the mother of a pre-school child thinks of the 
concept ‘to see red’, and then looking at the same idea from the perspective of a busy 
businesswoman or a widowed grandmother, you can generate totally new ideas.

(d) Break your routine: A good way of stimulating your thoughts is to break your 
routine. Here are a few suggestions:
•	 Take note of how you perform everyday actions, such as reading your emails 
and then do them differently. 
•	 Spend a whole day without something that is a part of each day’s routine, for 
example your cellphone. 
•	 Read a book on a subject that you know nothing about. 
•	 Start a conversation with a stranger (someone you would not normally speak to). 
•	 Do something you have never done before, such as going to the theatre, riding a 
horse or starting a new hobby or sport (in other words, broaden your horizons). 
(e) 	Explore the grey areas: If you tend to see only the right and wrong sides of a case, it is 
time to explore the grey areas between right and wrong. Make a habit of looking for 
different solutions and possibilities. Start by completing the following incomplete 
questions. See how many solutions you can find to each in ten minutes.
•	 What will happen if I ...? 
•	 In what different way can I ...? 
•	 Who will benefit by ...? 
Take some time to tune your mind for creativity before you start looking for business 
ideas. This mind-set will eventually help you to identify new or better business ideas. 
Team creativity 
There are at least 200 different techniques and tools to enhance the creativity of teams, 
for example:
•	 brain sketching 
•	 card story boards 
•	 Bunches of Bananas 
•	 pin cards 
•	 trigger sessions
•	 brainstorming
•	 creative problem-solving (CPS)
•	 idea advocate
•	 Super Heroes
•	 visualising a goal.
Some of these are discussed on the following pages. 
(a)  Brain sketching
With this technique you pass evolving sketches around the group. A group of 4–8 
people is best. Limited facilitation skills are required.

Chapter 3: The identification of feasible business ideas
53
•	 Sitting far enough apart to have some privacy, the group agree on the problem and 
discuss it until it is well understood by all. 
•	 Each participant privately draws one or more sketches (each on separate sheets of 
paper) of how the problem might be solved; passing each sketch on to the person 
on their right when they are finished. The sketches should not take more than five 
minutes to draw. 
•	 Participants take the sketches passed to them and either develop or annotate them, 
or use them to stimulate new sketches of their own, passing the amended original 
and/or any new sketches on to their neighbour to the right when ready. 
•	 After the process has been running for a suitable period and/or energy is running 
low, all the sketches are collected. 
•	 All sketches are displayed and discussed in turn for clarification and comment. The 
team then moves on to any appropriate categorisation, evaluation and selection 
process. 
(b)  Bunches of Bananas
The ‘Bunches of Bananas’ technique is one of lateral thinking, reducing excessive left-
brain attention (which may be fuelling a mind-set). There are people who instinctively 
liven up a sluggish meeting by being provocative, or ‘throwing in a bunch of bananas’. 
Here are some tips:
•	 Consider the mood and atmosphere: Are there signs of the group being stuck in a 
rut, sluggish or showing inertia? 
•	 What could you say or do to move the group out of this state of inertia? Create 
‘bunches of bananas’ to suit your own character and style. 
•	 Bear in mind that you are engaging in a ‘whole-brain’ activity. Just as with a 
comedian, it is as much the delivery as the idea that brings about the effect. 
•	 If the group is inexperienced, the approach may have to be appropriately signalled: ‘I 
know this is going to sound a little crazy, but bear with me a minute or so. Sometime 
you can get out of a rut in the most unexpected ways ...’. 
A group wanting to market goods from South Africa to Argentina exhausted all the obvious 
possibilities and seemed to be ‘stuck’. Then someone said:
‘We don’t seem to be getting very far. What I’d like to do would be to find a product that 
every Argentinian sheep would be clamouring to buy.’
Although this comment could have been met with disapproval or polite silence, the timing 
of his ‘Bunch of Bananas’ was just right and someone picked up the idea:
➠
eg

54
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
‘Sheep? Oh, you mean for us to find large numbers of customers who can be influenced 
easily. Perhaps we have been concentrating too hard on too few clients.’
The discussion this idea triggered eventually led to a new product being marketed to Argentina. 
Involvement in the business ensures that the entrepreneur will use her expertise and talents 
to offer clients the best possible service. This in turn ensures the success of the business.
•	 ‘Bunches of Bananas’ can come in a variety of forms – any well-placed joke or image 
that captures attention when appropriate.
(c)  Super Heroes
Super Heroes is a fantasy-based technique. Participants pretend to be a fictional (or 
real) super hero (Superman, the Incredible Hulk, Batman, Ironman, Wonder Woman, 
Sherlock Holmes, Spiderman, etc) and use their ‘super’ powers to trigger ideas.
This technique is good for creating an atmosphere of light-hearted fun in which energy 
is high and fantasy and metaphor are acceptable. All super heroes have skills and 
capacities that are outside ‘normal’ behaviour. This means that (a) people tend to think 
outside of the norm; and (b) play a role which allows them to express more unusual 
ideas than they might not normally express.
Super hero stories also have strong elements of wish-fulfilment and can therefore help 
people to express wishes. It may not be suitable for very serious or introverted groups, 
or where there is a lack of trust.
•	 Prepare some general information on each super hero in advance.
•	 This information could include their name, special powers, weaknesses, back-
ground, picture, etc. You can also provide props if you have an extrovert in the 
group.
•	 Display and discuss the problem to ensure everyone understands the issue. It can 
be useful to use brainstorming to list the more obvious ideas. (Brainstorming is a 
technique that allows people to build on each other’s ideas. Members of the group 
put forward ideas without interruption or evaluation from the others.) 
•	 Select a super hero for each participant. (Participants could also choose one for 
themselves or take one from your information pack.) Get them to think a little about 
that super hero and talk to them about what life would be like as a super hero in 
order to help them get into the role. 
•	 The super hero characters are then used as the basis of an excursion, from any 
viewpoint. The extrovert groups will get into the role (‘I will heat the chemicals 
instantly with my laser eyes whilst freezing the container with my breath’); whereas 
the more introverted groups will tend to be happier talking in the third person 
(‘Superman could heat the chemicals with his laser eyes ...’). 

Chapter 3: The identifi cation of feasible business ideas
55
• Start by getting each super hero to voice a few ideas. 
• Allow the group members to bounce off each other’s ideas. Perhaps if Superman 
and Wonder Woman worked together they could produce an improved solution? 
• When you have suffi cient ideas, evaluate them. 
(d) Trigger sessions
Trigger sessions are a good way of getting lots of ideas from untrained resources.
• The person with the problem explains and defi nes it. 
• Each member in the group writes down his or her ideas quickly (two minutes only). 
• One member reads out his or her list – others silently cross out similar ideas read 
out and write down ideas that are ‘hitch-hiked’ (ideas that are triggered by the ideas 
being read out). 
• The second member reads out his or her list (ideas not covered on anyone else’s list), 
followed in turn by other members. 
• The last member reads out his original list plus his ‘hitch-hiked’ list. The procedure 
is then repeated in the reverse order to the original order (for example, if there are 
six members, the order is: member 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, then 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, then 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ... ). 
A good group will be able to manage several passes. Everyone’s paper is then collected 
and can be typed up into a single list of ideas – all duplicates should have been crossed 
out during the session. 
3.4 
GENERATING BUSINESS IDEAS
A good business idea seldom comes out of the blue or as an inspiration. As a potential 
entrepreneur, you must deliberately look and think creatively for ideas that can be 
converted into a business.
In your search for ideas, you can make use of certain structured techniques. The tech-
niques for the generation of business ideas proposed in this book can be divided into 
fi ve broad approaches.
The generation of ideas
From skills, 
expertise and 
aptitude
From common
needs
From existing 
problems
From everyday 
activities
From other
sources
Figure 3.2: The generation of business ideas 

56
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
These approaches have been tested successfully and promise to produce positive 
results. We will discuss them in the following sections.
3.4.1	 The generation of ideas from the entrepreneur’s skills, 
	
expertise and aptitude
We all have certain skills. In Chapter 2 we saw that an entrepreneur’s skills, expertise 
and aptitudes are some of the key factors for success (turn back to page 32).
In addition, consider the following:
•	 Formal training does not necessarily guarantee success in a business enterprise. 
However, this does not mean that your qualifications are useless. Through your 
studies you can obtain certain knowledge that can lead to a business idea. An 
engineering student has, for example, gained certain technical knowledge which 
could give him or her an idea to start a specific manufacturing business.
•	 Skills can also be gained from working experience. As an employee you are 
responsible for certain activities. Your knowledge of these activities can enable you 
to start a business of your own involving these activities. For example, the fact that 
you functioned in a marketing capacity can be the reason why you want to start an 
advertising agency or act as a marketing consultant.
•	 Have you developed any skills through your hobbies or other non-career activities 
that could be used as ideas for your own business? For example, the fact that you 
collect antiques and know how to negotiate to get the best swap or price for your 
items, means you have learned certain purchasing or negotiating skills.
Draw up a profile of your own abilities.
1.	 List your skills. For example, can you weld or knit?
2.	 Identify your expertise. List your formal qualifications (for example, diplomas or 
certificates) and experience gained (for example, handling difficult customers).
3.	 Write down your natural aptitudes/talents and interests. For example, you may be able 
to communicate well (this is an aptitude). Your interests may be steelwork or building 
websites.
This list of skills, expertise and aptitudes can now be used to identify business ideas. To 
show you how this can be done, consider the following example.
Sarah Qubeka has one outstanding skill; she can cook well. With this skill she can provide 
a product or service for individuals or organisations.

You can identify many business ideas by thinking of how to provide products or 
services to individuals or organisations, and what types of products or services they 
might need.
By following the example below, you can see how many ideas Sarah, with her single 
skill, could identify.

Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
3.4.2	 The generation of ideas from common needs
We all need something. However, our needs are not all the same. With your idea, you 
should try to satisfy a need among a range of people for the same product or service. In 
other words, you must try to satisfy a common/shared need.
Individuals with common needs can usually be grouped together, for example, all 
mothers with small children, all members of a soccer team and all prospective home-
owners.
You can also identify groups of organisations that have the same need, for example, 
businesses that need catering on a regular basis, or businesses that have a need for a 
complete maintenance service.
Try this yourself and write down examples of interest groups and their needs on a sheet 
of paper. An example is given on page 59.
By concentrating on the needs of only one interest group, you will find that many 
business ideas will occur to you.
3.4.3	 The generation of ideas from existing problems
Instead of thinking of unfulfilled needs, you can think of existing, unsolved problems. 
Think of things that irritate you. Now think of ways of removing those irritations.
Small businesses can usually only buy small quantities of stock at a time and consequently 
have to pay higher prices than businesses that buy in bulk. An entrepreneur could solve 
this problem by acting as a part-time buyer for a group of small businesses. In this way, the 
entrepreneur could obtain bulk prices for them.
Knowledge of these problems enables you, as a prospective entrepreneur, to find the initial 
idea for a business that is based on the solution of a specific problem.
Page 64 illustrates a technique for generating business ideas formulated by the Scottish 
Enterprise Foundation. This example uses the general problem of traffic jams to illustrate 
the technique.

• Use print or electronic media: Think of the products that are advertised on television, 
in magazines and in newspapers. Ask yourself whether they can be improved or 
distributed or marketed in a different way.

•	 Look in other places: You can come up with business ideas by looking in unlikely 
places. Use the following questions to help:
P
P
What ideas can you get at an airport, a movie theatre or a church?
P
P
What ideas can you bring back from a sports meeting, a fun fair or a doctor’s 
consulting rooms?
P
P
Explore a part of your city or town that you have not seen before. What do you 
notice?
P
P
Take note of the novelties and different ways of doing things at places where you 
go on holiday.
•	 Talk to other people: Have conversations with your family, friends, colleagues and 
businesspeople and find out if they have come across possible business ideas. The 
problem of obtaining holiday accommodation at short notice could, for example, 
lead to an enterprise that specialises in finding and allocating unused and cancelled 
holiday accommodation.
•	 At work: Ask yourself if the products and services at your place of work could be 
improved upon.
•	 Go shopping: Examine some of the products on your next visit to the shops. 
Remember that no product or service is perfect. By asking questions about the 
products, new ideas can emerge. Here are some questions you can ask.
The many computer ‘apps’ (applications) that are mushrooming everywhere could have 
been generated in this way.
Here are some questions to ask yourself: 
•	 What problems are there with this product?
•	 How can the product be improved in any way?
•	 Is there a better way for the product to be packaged?
•	 Can any new product be added to the present range of products?
•	 Can the product be aimed at another market?
The child-proof lid, which is used on medicine bottles to prevent children opening the  
bottle, probably was developed after someone thought about the dangers of medicine 
bottles.
•	 Changes in your immediate area: By noting changes or important events that take 
place around you, you can identify new business ideas.

If a South African sports team wins a championship or Olympic medal, this creates an 
opportunity for an entrepreneur to sell T-shirts bearing a suitable message. This happened 
in 2007 when the Springboks won the Rugby World Cup – an entrepreneur started printing 
T-shirts with the message Rugby World Champions.
3.4.5 The generation of ideas from other sources 
Apart from taking note of everyday activities, you can also fi nd ideas by consulting 
other reference sources. The following are some examples:
Yellow 
Pages
Business
publications
OTHER
SOURCES
Inventors’
associations
Overseas
products
Trade
shows
Advertisements
Patents
that have
expired
Figure 3.3: Methods of generating ideas from other sources 
• The Yellow Pages: The Yellow Pages lists almost all products and/or services that 
a business can provide. (It is better to use the Yellow Pages of a large city because 
it would contain more information.) By reading the reference index at the front 
of the Yellow Pages, you can discover a variety of products and/or services in a 
short space of time. The adverts in the Yellow Pages can provide more information 
on specifi c products and/or services. The Yellow Pages is also available online at 
yellowpages.co.za.
• Consult business publications: Magazines such as Entrepreneur Magazine, Your 
Business Magazine and Succeed Magazine can be valuable sources of ideas. BusinessBrief 
magazine (bbrief.co.za) is an example of an online magazine to help decision-makers 
in business make better business decisions. 
eg

Chapter 3: The identification of feasible business ideas
63
•	 Contact an inventors’ association: This can be a rich source of ideas, for example, 
you might be able to collaborate with an inventor to produce and market his or 
her invention. Two associations that might be useful to contact are the Institute of 
Inventors and the SA Inventors & Designer Society. 
•	 Examine patents that have expired: Patents that have expired are public property. 
There can be various reasons why a patent has not been exploited, and it may now 
be ready for the market. These reasons could include:
P
P
Bigger markets for the product have arisen in the interim. 
P
P
The product can now be used with other products that were previously unavailable. 
P
P
The product can be manufactured using new technology, which now makes it 
technically feasible and commercially viable. 
P
P
New use for the product has arisen. 
P
P
An example of an expired patent is antibiotics and pills to alleviate muscular 
injuries. Lennon Medicines sell a product called Panamor that is comparable to 
the well-known product Voltaren. Panamor originated on the expiry of a patent 
on the original product.
•	 Investigate advertisements for business opportunities: Newspapers, magazines 
and the Internet often carry advertisements for business opportunities. Although 
many of these must be investigated with caution, there are real opportunities avail-
able and these can serve as sources of new business ideas. Note, for example how 
many franchising opportunities are advertised in the newspapers. 
•	 Visit trade shows: Trade shows are a good source of ideas. You also get the oppor-
tunity to see the physical product and to talk to the exhibitors about the potential 
market, product features, new technology and even the possibility of doing business 
together. 
•	 Examine overseas products: Products that are not yet available in South Africa are 
often imported, imitated or adapted for the South African market. The franchise 
Sweets from Heaven, which presents a variety of sweets in a particular way, was 
based on an idea obtained from abroad. 
3.5	
THE DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF 
	
BUSINESS IDEAS 
In the previous section you were encouraged not to limit your creativity but to think 
about all possible business ideas. Most of these ideas will not work, however. The 
initial sifting of ideas is performed by relying on your personal judgement and ‘gut 
feeling’. 
Only one of your ideas can be converted into a business on its own or in combination 
with one or more of the other ideas on your list. To choose the correct business idea, you 
must evaluate each idea on your list. 

64
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
Although there are examples of entrepreneurs who have converted an idea into a 
successful business opportunity merely on the strength of their intuition, this is not the 
best way. (Henry Ford, the creator of the Model-T Ford, is an example of someone who 
followed his intuition and made millions from it.) 
Business ideas can be evaluated chiefl y by means of two methods: namely a feasibility 
study and a viability study. 
A feasibility study is a general examination of the potential of the idea to be converted into 
a business enterprise. This study focuses largely on the ability of the entrepreneur to convert 
the idea into a business enterprise. 
A viability study is an in-depth investigation into profi tability of the idea to be converted 
into a business enterprise.   
Before you can start evaluating your idea, you must fi rst be clear about what each of 
these ideas means. In particular, two things must be clear:
• what the chief activities of the business will be 
• who the customers will be. 
The activities of the business will consist of two or more of the following:
• the manufacture of a product 
• the provision of a service 
• the sale of other people’s products and/or services. 
Your customers will consist of:
• individuals and/or
• organisations.
These concepts can be illustrated by means of the following ‘bow-tie’ diagram.

The bow-tie diagram provides six options for your business, namely:
1. the manufacture of products for individuals
2. the provision of services for individuals
3. the sale of other people’s products and/or services to individuals
4. the manufacture of products for organisations
5. the provision of services for organisations
6. the sale of other people’s products and/or services to organisations.
3.5.1 The development of your business ideas
The bow-tie diagram can also be used to develop your business idea in terms of:
• the essence of the idea
• the possible combination of ideas
• the possibility of taking a new direction with the idea.
Suppose we take the idea ‘to bake cakes’. In the following example you can see all the 
ideas that might emerge from this one idea.
ORGANISATIONS
• Fantasy business logo cakes
• Special diet cake for cafés
• Cake decorations
INDIVIDUALS
• Fantasy cakes
• Ready-to-use cake mixes
• Book on cake designs
• Cooking lessons
• Renting out baking pans
• Catering
• Diet recipes helpline
• Cake delivery service for caterers

From the previous exercise you can see that we can develop the idea ‘to bake cakes’ 
further. Here are some examples:
•	 baking fantasy cakes (the essence of the idea)
•	 making fantasy cakes and making and selling cake decorations to bakeries (the 
combination of ideas)
•	 selling cake decoration equipment and materials online (taking a new direction with 
the idea).
3.5.2	 The feasibility of your business ideas
To determine whether your business idea is feasible, you must be able to answer the 
following four questions satisfactorily:
•	 Do you want to do what the idea suggests?
•	 Is there a market for your idea?
•	 Can you meet the needs of your customers?
•	 Can you advertise the idea to your customers?
To determine the feasibility of your business idea, answer the following questions, by 
filling in a tick (✓) or a question mark (?) in the block alongside each question. 
1.	 Do you want to do what the idea suggests?
•	 Is the idea really something that you want to pursue?	
•	 Do you want to do business with the types of people who will be your  
customers?	
•	 Do you have the health, energy and personality to pursue your idea?	
•	 Can you cope with the long hours, few, if any, holidays, etc associated with  
this idea?	
•	 Will you sacrifice the things that are important to you in order to make a 
successful enterprise out of this idea?	
•	 Does your family understand the full implications of your decision to start a 
business?	
•	 Do you have the support of your family and are they willing to help?	
•	 Is this idea more important to you than any other idea that you have identified?	
Adapted from Richardson and Clarke (1990) 

Chapter 3: The identification of feasible business ideas
67
If you filled in any question marks in the blocks, you must ask yourself whether you really 
want to pursue this specific idea. In other words, have you got the motivation to achieve 
success with it? Think of ways to change the question marks to ticks and how, for example 
you can justify the ticks to your bank manager. 
2.	 Is there a market for your idea?
•	 Do you know who your customers will be? 
•	 Will they pay you for your product and/or service? 
•	 Do you think there are many customers for your idea? How many (more or less)? 
•	 Will people prefer your product and/or service to those of your competitors? 
•	 Do you think you will gain more customers in the future? 
•	 What are three advantages you have over your competitors? 
•	 Can you prevent other people from copying your idea? 
Adapted from Richardson and Clarke (1990) 
If you filled in any question marks in the blocks, you must ask yourself whether you have a 
market for this specific idea. How can you change the question marks to ticks, and how can 
you justify the ticks to someone like your bank manager? 
3.	 Can you meet the needs of your customers?
•	 Do you have, or can you develop, the skills to manufacture your product and/or to 
provide your service? 
•	 Can you provide the quantity and quality of products or give the level of service that 
your customers want? 
•	 Do you know how much money you can charge for your product or service? How 
much? 
•	 If you need someone to help you provide your product or service, do you know 
anyone who would be willing to do it? 
•	 Do you know more or less how much money you will need to start your business? 
How much? 
•	 Do you know how much money you will need in the first year to run your business? 
How much? 

•	 Do you personally have the money to start and run your business? How much do 
you still need? Where will you get the rest of the money? 
Adapted from Richardson and Clarke (1990) 
If you filled in any question marks in the list, you must ask yourself if you can pursue this 
idea. Think of ways to turn the question marks into ticks, and how you will, for example 
justify the ticks to a bank manager. 
4.	 Can you advertise the idea to your customers? 
•	 Do you know how your customer buys this product and/or service? 
•	 Is there a special magazine, newspaper or blog that your customers read? What is 
it? 
•	 Do you know of any agents or intermediaries who are currently selling to your 
customers? Who are they? 
•	 Do you know of any businesses or organisations that are currently doing business 
with your customers? Where are they? 
•	 Will these businesses or organisations be prepared to promote your idea? 
•	 Can you get the names and addresses of a large number of potential customers? 
About how many? 
•	 Do you already have various customers who have indicated that they will buy from 
you? How many? 
Adapted from Richardson and Clarke (1990)  
The question marks in the questionnaire are not very important. What is more impor-
tant is that there must be many ticks. If you do not have any ticks, or only one or two, 
you must ask yourself if you should pursue this idea. How can you turn the question 
marks into ticks, and how can you justify the ticks to your bank manager, for example? 
How do you feel about your business idea, now that you have answered all the ques-
tions? Complete the rating scale by circling the number that represents your choice.

By counting the numbers that you circled, you can make the following deductions from 
your results:

If you definitely feel that it is not for you, you must start the process of 
	
identifying ideas from the beginning.

If you are still undecided, you must go back to your list of business ideas 
	
and consider other options. 
 12 and above	
Your idea is feasible and must be explored further. 
If you have found, by means of the results above, that your business idea is in fact 
feasible, you can go on to investigate its viability. Since the viability study is very 
expensive in terms of time and money, it is important that you first do the feasibility 
study as shown previously. The next chapter explains step-by-step the process to 
investigate the viability of a business idea. 
3.6	
SUMMARY 
In this chapter we took the first step in setting up a business, namely the identification 
of a feasible business idea. 
A business idea does not always have to be innovative, but it must stand out from other 
competitive products or services in some way. This means that the entrepreneur must 
be able to act creatively. The creative abilities of prospective entrepreneurs can be im-
proved in various ways, such as thinking unconventionally or viewing a matter from 
another person’s perspective or using one of the various group creativity techniques. 
The techniques by which business ideas can be generated that are proposed in this 
book, can be divided into five broad approaches: from the skills, expertise and apti-
tudes of the entrepreneur; from common needs; from existing problems; from everyday 
activities; and from other sources. These approaches can take place separately or in 
combination. You might encounter a problem, for example in a work situation and de-
velop it further by means of the ideas-from-problems technique. 

70
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
A business idea must be able to be defined in terms of its business activity and customers 
before it is evaluated and developed. 
By matching the business ideas with questions on how the prospective entrepreneur 
feels about the specific idea, its feasibility can be determined. Business ideas must also 
be viable before they can be turned into a business.  
Self-evaluation questions 
1.	
List the three stages of setting up a business. 
2.	
Define creativity. 
3.	
Differentiate between divergent and convergent thinking. 
4.	
Perform an online brain dominance test. What is the result of the test and how 
does it relate to your inclination for creativity? 
5.	
Suppose you and two friends want to start a business together. Explain two 
creativity techniques that you can use to help generate business ideas (use one 
of the techniques explained in this chapter and one technique that you have 
researched on your own). 
6.	
Generate business ideas from your skills, expertise or aptitude by using the 
method proposed in this chapter. 
7.	
Generate business ideas from common needs that people have by using the 
method proposed in this chapter. 
8.	
Generate business ideas from existing problems by using the method proposed 
in this chapter. 
9.	
Generate business ideas from everyday activities by using the method 
proposed in this chapter. 
10.	 Generate business ideas from other sources by using the method proposed in 
this chapter. 
11.	 Take one of your business ideas generated in Questions 6 to 10 and further 
develop it by using the proposed bow-tie diagram. 
12.	 Determine the feasibility of one of your business ideas by answering the 
following four broad questions: Do you want to do what the idea suggests? Is 
there a market for your idea? Can you meet the needs of your customers? Can 
you advertise the idea to your customers? (Motivate your answers and final 
conclusion.) 

After you have studied this chapter, you should be able to perform a viability study for a proposed 
business idea by doing the following: 
• determine whether a need exists for a product or service 
• defi ne the mission and objectives for the business 
• calculate the market share of the product or service 
• calculate the income that can be derived from the product or service 
• determine the break-even point for the business 
• understand the implications of calculating the break-even point 
• determine whether a sustainable profi t can be made 
• draw up a cash budget to determine whether the business can service its fi nancial obligations 
as they occur. 
4.2 INTRODUCTION 
After investigating idea generation and studying feasible business ideas, we will now 
focus on exploring the planning phase of a business. It is unfortunate that many people 
neglect or do not spend enough time in the planning stage before starting up their 
businesses. It is important that a clear planning framework is set up by the owner to 
ensure its operations are a success.
Business planning usually has two phases. The fi rst is to establish whether a business 
idea is viable: this is known as the viability study. For an idea to be a viable business 
idea, you must be able to market it and manage your business at a sustainable profi t. 
Only if you fi nd that the idea is viable do you continue to the second phase: drawing 
up the business plan. The business plan summarises the conclusions drawn from the 
viability study. It can then be used to make the idea known to other people, and to 
obtain fi nancing to implement the business idea.

An idea is viable if you can market it and manage a business over time at a sustainable 
profi t. The viability of your idea must be tested, based on certain assumptions (see 
page 74) and on research you will have to conduct. The viability study must also make 
provision for unforeseen circumstances.
What would happen if you were unable to keep running your business due to health or 
personal problems? Or if you and your business partner are not on speaking terms any 
longer because of a fi nancial dispute? What would you do if the product or service you were 
selling was replaced by technology or machinery? 
Your idea will not be viable if it cannot be managed over a period of time at a sustainable 
profi t. Usually this period is between two and fi ve years. 
4.3 THE VIABILITY STUDY
The viability study (also known as a feasibility study) entails estimating the interest in the 
business and its product or service, the expected sales in units and at a certain price, the 
expected costs associated in generating the sales, the strengths and weaknesses of the 
business, and so forth.   
Before you can begin work on the viability study, you will have to do some market 
research and gather various facts and fi gures to estimate the size of the market. You 
should not be too optimistic during this phase; it is much better to underestimate the 
size of the market than to overestimate it.

These are some of the typical questions you should find answers to:
•	 Is there a need for my product or service? (Needs analysis)
•	 What is the customer who is going to buy my product or service like? (Customer profile/
characteristics)
•	 What are the estimated sales for the product or service, based on the available capacity 
and given the level of competition and trading area? (Market share)
•	 What price will people be prepared to pay for the product or service? (Price analysis) 
Based on the information received from the market research, you can make some 
assumptions, such as:
•	 the estimated number of units that will be sold
•	 the acceptable price that the market will be prepared to pay for the product or service
•	 the cash flow requirements for the business.
It is therefore essential that you do a proper needs analysis of the market. The section 
below explains how to do this.
4.4	 THE NEEDS ANALYSIS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF 
	
CUSTOMERS
As an entrepreneur, the very first thing you should do is find out exactly who your 
potential customers are, what their needs are and how they make their buying decisions. 
The key to success is to make sure that the product or service you offer is what the 
customer wants and not just what you want to sell.
In order to be able to make a decision on the viability of your idea or business, you 
must have information on the characteristics, needs and purchasing patterns of the 
customers. Given the intense competition in the market today, reliable information is 
the key to a successful business. 
In Chapter 1 we explained that people buy products and/or services in order to satisfy 
a need. However, this concept of buying to satisfy a need is not that clear or straightfor-
ward. On the one hand, a need can be very strongly felt but not easily defined but, on 
the other hand, there can be various options for satisfying that specific need. There is 
generally a distinct difference between the physical product that customers buy and the 
image customers have of the product. When you are about to provide a product or ser-
vice to the market, you must determine which need that product or service will satisfy.
eg

Chapter 4: The viability of a business idea
75
To do this, you need to be very specific about who your customers are and be able to de-
velop a customer profile. A customer profile is nothing more than a description of your 
potential customers. You must be able to determine their distinguishing characteristics 
and then look for information about their location and numbers.
An example of a customer profile would be:
Age: 	
Between 18 and 25
Family status: 	
Single
Income: 	
Low to moderate income range
Geographic region: 	 Western Cape 
The needs of the market (customers) must form the basis for your marketing strategy. It 
is one thing to determine what customers want, but another matter altogether to meet 
that need profitably. Therefore it is important that you establish how you can provide 
the right product or service at the right price so that you can make a profit. If you cannot 
make a profit within a certain time period, there is no sense in entering that market.
To establish if there is a need for a product or service, you must define the market in 
terms of its total size, that is, the group or groups of potential customers you will be 
marketing your business to. You should also identify the market where your product/s 
or service will be most widely accepted.
To establish if there is a need for a particular product or service, you can ask these questions 
to conduct your market research. 
(a) 	List the features of the product or service: This will help you to focus on each 
aspect of your product or service and decide whether it meets the needs of the market. 
For example, my product is colourful, enamel cast iron casseroles and cookware. The 
features of the casseroles are that it has excellent heat retention when cooking; it is a 
very durable product with a lifetime guarantee; it is aesthetically pleasing and comes in 
a range of colours; it can be used for cooking as well as serving and dishing up at dinner 
parties.
(b)  Determine who the major competitors are and who the industry leaders are, 
as well as suppliers and other major role-players in this market: This section is 
very important as it forces you to examine the industry as a whole, in order to determine 
its place in the market. You need to look at the size of your competitors and how they 
compete in the marketplace. If, for example, competition is largely on price, you may 
want to stay out of the market as customer loyalty will be low in such a market. Not only 
➠
eg
NB

76
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
	
must you look at direct competition (other cast iron cookware manufacturers) but you 
also need to look at indirect competition (customers might prefer to spend their money 
on other kitchen aids and appliances). In a similar way, you should identify and evaluate 
your suppliers. Suppliers vary, some are reliable and deliver the right product on time at 
a good price, and others do not. 
(c)  	Identify the possible customers and segment the market: To do this, you need 
to define the market in terms of its total size and target market. Each market must be  
examined carefully as to overall size, demand and potential profitability. It is not possible 
to try and satisfy all segments so it is better to focus on that part that is most likely 
to buy your product. Determining which market segments are most attractive is called 
market segmentation. Market research will be crucial to obtain this information. 
(d)  Draw up a final list. This should include:
•	 the features of your product or service 
•	 the needs of the customers that the product or service will meet 
•	 a profile of your customers 
•	 the potential number of customers. 
For example, the results of market research show that females between the ages of 30 and 
45 are most likely to buy cast iron cookware. In this case, it is obvious to focus on females 
in that age group. 
Once you have this information, you can determine what kind of business you wish to 
start. You can then also define your business and determine its objectives.
4.5	 THE MISSION STATEMENT AND OBJECTIVES OF 
	
THE BUSINESS
In Chapter 1, the mission statement and objectives of the business were broadly de-
scribed as ‘what you want to achieve ... and how you will achieve it’. In this section 
we will look at these in more detail. By this stage, you probably know what type of 
business you would like to run. It is therefore possible to move on to defining the  
mission statement and objectives. This is an important task and deserves some time 
and thought.
It is usual to define a business according to the product or service that you wish to sell, 
as well as by the customer profile. The definition must not be too narrow or too broad. 
If it is too narrow, it might exclude possible opportunities, but a definition that is too 
eg

Chapter 4: The viability of a business idea
77
general can cause a lack of focus. The following questions will help you define your 
business:
•	 Who are the customers of the business?
•	 Which customer needs will the business satisfy?
•	 How will the business satisfy these needs?
By following the steps outlined on page 75, you have already collected the information 
to answer these questions. You can now proceed to defining the mission statement.
4.5.1	 Mission statement
A business is defined by its mission statement. Only a clear definition of the mission 
and purpose of the business makes it possible for clear and realistic objectives. Most 
companies have their mission statement on their websites. For example, Estee Lauder’s 
mission statement, which is ‘bringing the best to everyone we touch’ clearly describes 
what they want to achieve. 
A mission statement defines the fundamental and unique purpose of a business and 
identifies its products or services, as well as its customers. The mission of a business is 
defined by customers’ satisfaction with its products and services.   
Questions that need to be answered when formulating the mission statement are:
•	 Who are the customers?
•	 Why do they buy?
•	 What do they buy?
•	 How do they buy?
•	 Where are they located?
•	 How can the customers be reached?
•	 What, in the opinion of the customer, is value for money?
Here is an example of a Harley-Davidson’s mission statement:
‘We fulfil dreams through the experience of motorcycling, by providing to motorcyclists and 
to the general public an expanding line of motorcycles and branded products and services 
in selected market segments.’ 
D
eg

78
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
After you have set the mission statement, you can now formulate objectives for your 
business. The objectives must be measurable, realistic, clear, attainable and within a set 
timeframe.
An objective is something the business wants to achieve over a set period of time. 
   
An example of an objective could be to show a 10% return on capital within the first three 
years of the business’s existence. 
Objectives are necessary so that you have something to measure progress against. They 
are usually adjusted over time, based on changes that take place in the industry and 
environment. 
Defining your mission statement and objectives clarifies what your business is all 
about. It will also help you calculate your market share, so that you can work out if 
your product or service can be marketed profitably. You must make realistic predic-
tions. Whatever you do, do not be too optimistic; it does not help to mislead yourself. If 
you are too optimistic, it could lead to failure. 
4.6	 CALCULATING THE EXPECTED MARKET SHARE 
The next step in the planning process is to determine the expected market share for your 
product or service. It is important to calculate this as accurately as possible, because this 
share will be used as a basis to estimate the potential income of your business. Again, 
we must stress that you should not overestimate the potential market as this will give 
you a false sense of what your income could be. 
To calculate the expected market share you need to:
•	 estimate the total potential market for your product or service 
•	 estimate what portion of the market is occupied by your competitors 
•	 estimate what portion you can expect to sell to (this is known as your target market). 
A method for calculating these figures follows to help you calculate your expected 
market share. 
4.6.1	 Calculating the potential market 
It is not easy to estimate a potential market. Most entrepreneurs work with unquantified 
information and must make many assumptions. However, when you identified the 
D
eg

Chapter 4: The viability of a business idea
79
need for your product, you collected much of the information needed to segment your 
market. 
When trying to establish the potential market, you should begin by dividing it into 
various market segments. 
A boutique dessert shop in George, Western Cape cannot cater for all the needs and tastes 
in the dessert and sweet market. The owner must therefore select a specific segment of 
the total market to service. For instance, the owner must sell either ice cream and frozen 
desserts or baked goods like confectionery, biscuits, cakes, pastries and puddings. The 
chosen segment is then called the target market and consists of customers with similar 
needs and tastes. 
Establishing your target market consists of three steps:
•	 market segmentation
•	 evaluation and the target-market decision
•	 market positioning.
(a)  Market segmentation
Market segmentation is the process whereby the total market is identified and divided 
into sub-groups or segments with similar needs. The market can be sub-divided as 
follows:
•	 Demographic segmentation: Demographic features such as age, gender and race 
are useful for describing customers with similar needs. 
My target market is elderly people, between the ages of 65 and 85 years old, in the middle 
to high income group. 
•	 Geographical segmentation: Because you cannot cater for all the elderly people in 
South Africa, you should choose one area, for instance only those in the southern 
suburbs in Cape Town.
•	 Psychographic segmentation: Customers can be grouped on the basis of their 
personality or lifestyle, for instance those who enjoy hobbies such as reading and 
knitting.
•	 Behaviouristic segmentation: Some people may be widowed and live alone, some 
prefer spending once a week with their families while others are sickly and cannot 
look after themselves. Some only go and eat out on special occasions with their 
families and other elderly couples eat out at least once a week. You should note that 
customer behaviour differs.
eg

Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
Because there are various ways to segment the market, you must select appropriate criteria 
for your product or service. Table 4.1 gives some examples.
Table 4.1:  Different ways to segment the market

holiday

racquets

entertainment

psychographic
Cinemas

Behaviouristic
 
(b)  Evaluation and the target-market decision
After you have grouped the total market into segments, you must select one segment 
as your target market and focus your marketing campaigns on that specific segment. 
The choice of your segment should be governed by things such as accessibility (for 
advertising purposes) and size (to generate enough profits).
If most single elderly customers (size) in an area prefer eating alone at home every 
night and there is no prepared meals service provider or delivery service in the area, it 
is logical to cater for prepared meals (accessibility) as this will generate more sales and 
profits.
(c)  Market positioning 
If you choose more than one segment as your target market, you must design a different 
marketing campaign for each segment. For example, one market segment prefers having 
prepared meals at home and the other segment prefers family dining; advertising for 
these segments will differ. 
It is usually impossible for any one entrepreneur to focus on the total market. It is 
usually preferable and realistic to focus on one segment only. We call this the target-
market decision. Successful entrepreneurs go for a large share in one segment, rather 
than a small share in the total market. 
4.6.2	 Calculating the size of the market 
Here is the traditional method for estimating the market size of your target market.

Maria wants to sell homemade rusks, biscuits and desserts in the university hostel where 
she lives and studies. There are 400 students living in the hostel and the average annual 
income per person is R12 000. On average the students spend 0.1% of their income on 
snacks like rusks, biscuits and desserts during the year. Maria is convinced that she will 
attract 7% market share, as students already buy rusks and biscuits from the local home 
industry and also other competitors where the students buy their groceries. What is the 
potential rand value of this market?

6.	 Realistic percentage of market share

7.	 Rand value of Maria’s market share		
R33 600 
The rand value of Maria’s sales amounts to R33 600 a year. This is not her profit, but her 
turnover. This rough estimate gives the entrepreneur an idea of the market potential. Be 
careful not to be over-optimistic of your potential market share. 
If Maria is happy with her rand value, she can continue with her business plans. If she is 
unhappy with the market share, she should research another business idea. 
To retain this market share or even increase it, the entrepreneur should market products in 
such a way as to attract customers from other competitors.

How do we determine the number of units, average income, percentage spent on items, 
etc? This information can be found in reports in newspapers, from government departments, 
municipalities and research bureaus of universities. 
4.6.3 Calculating the expected market share
There may be times when a business cannot satisfy the demand for a product or service 
because its capacity restricts the number of products that it can produce. At other times, 
the economy may be in decline and customers may not be able to satisfy their need for 
the product because they do not have the necessary money or credit to buy it. Because 
the economy and external environment changes, you should determine what your 
expected market share would be under these varying circumstances. 
The expected market share is that part of the target market that a business will be able 
to serve on the basis of its production capacity and the state of the economy.
Target market

State of economy
Figure 4.2: Expected market share
It is not easy to estimate the expected market share but it is important to do this as 
accurately as possible in order to calculate a realistic potential income. In order to be 
realistic and to reduce risk, you should calculate three scenarios: 
• a very prosperous one
• a very conservative one, and
• a most likely one.
The average of the three scenarios could be taken as the one to work from. (Remember 
that if you ‘manipulate’ or infl ate the fi gures, you will only be fooling yourself!)
You should then calculate the profi t for each scenario and judge from that whether it 
is worth going ahead with the business idea. (See page 88 for an explanation of how 
to calculate your profi t.) This kind of calculation is imperative if you intend to obtain 
fi nancing from a source such as a bank.
Table 4.2 illustrates the steps needed to test a business idea’s feasibility.

4.7	 CALCULATING THE INCOME
To calculate the potential income for your business, you have to work out the selling 
price of your product or service. To do this, you must establish exactly what costs will 
be incurred to manufacture and sell the product. You must first know what the total cost  
per unit (cost price) will be before you can calculate the selling price (see 4.7.1).
The selling price must at least cover all the costs. If the costs are not covered, the business 
will show a loss from the start and will not survive.
After the costs per unit have been established, the next step in calculating the selling price 
is to add a percentage profit (markup) to the cost price (cost price + profit = selling price).
If you add a markup of 30% and the cost price of the product is R20, the product will 
sell at 130/100 × R20 = R26.00.
To calculate the selling price by adding a markup to the cost price, you must add the 
percentage markup to 100 and then divide it by 100. You then multiply the answer by 
the cost price of the product.
If you have a 30% markup and the cost price of the product is R20, the selling price will be:
30 + 100 = 130
130
100 = 1,30
1,30 x 20 = R26.00 (selling price)
Put differently, the selling price would be R20 plus R6 = R26.00. 
If you have a 50% markup and the cost price of the product is R30, the selling price will be:
50 + 100 = 150
150
100 = 1,50
1,50 x 30 = R45.00 (selling price)
When deciding what the markup and selling price should be, you need to look at what 
the market price is (what your competitors are charging for the same product). If your 
eg

84
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
market analysis has shown that the market is price sensitive, you must charge a price 
that is competitive. If the market is not price sensitive, then you may get away with 
charging a higher price if the product can be differentiated. 
4.7.1	 Calculating the total costs per unit of the product (cost price 
	
of the product)
When calculating the cost price it is important to classify the costs as either:
•	 variable and fixed costs, or 
•	 direct and indirect costs. 
Variable costs are costs that are fixed per unit, but variable in total. This means that 
the costs rise in relation to the number of units manufactured (see graph below). For 
example, if the raw materials in a product cost R2 and 20 products are manufactured, 
the total variable cost is R40. If 30 products are manufactured, the total variable cost is 
R60, but it is still R2 for one product. 
Figure 4.3 shows variable costs on a graph.

Fixed costs are the costs that are fixed in total, but variable per unit. Look at the 
following graph. The rent on a factory is R100. This means that if you make 10 units of 
your product, each one costs R10 to make (point A). If 20 products are manufactured 
(point B), the total fixed cost is still R100, but each unit costs R5. Figure 4.4 illustrates 
fixed costs on a graph.

Direct costs are costs that can be allocated directly to the manufacture of the product. 
Examples of direct costs are the raw materials used for the manufacture of a product, 
and wages of labourers who are directly involved in manufacturing the product. 
Indirect costs (also called overheads) are costs that cannot be allocated directly to a 
product. Examples of these are rent on the factory, electricity, water, depreciation and 
indirect wages (like the salary of the owner).

Figure 4.5: Calculating total costs 
The way the cost of a product is calculated depends on the type of business. There are 
different ways of calculating costs in different types of businesses. These are discussed 
below. 
(a) Calculating the total costs per unit of a product for a manufacturing
 
business
The total costs of a product in a manufacturing business consist of manufacturing costs 
plus commercial overhead costs.
• Manufacturing costs consist of direct labour costs (the wages of the factory workers), 
direct material costs (the costs of raw materials) and manufacturing overhead costs 
(indirect costs).

overheads. The administrative overhead costs are all costs related to the admin-
istration of the business functions, such as human resources, fi nance and manage-
ment. Marketing costs are all the costs incurred in marketing the product, such as 
advertising.

• Calculate the direct labour costs needed to manufacture one unit of a product. 
• Calculate the indirect costs per unit of the product. (Add the manufacturing 
overheads, marketing overheads and administrative overheads together and divide 
this total by the number of products that was manufactured in the same period the 
costs were incurred – for example, one month.)
• Add the costs together to get the total costs per unit.

(b) Calculating the total costs per hour for a service business
In a service business, the product that is for sale is knowledge and skill. An example 
of this type of enterprise would be a business that repairs computer equipment. In this 
kind of business, an hourly rate for labour must be calculated.
Follow these steps to calculate the total costs of one unit of ‘product’.
• Calculate the number of business hours per month. (This is the number of hours the 
business operates.) For example, daily from 7:00 to 16:00, in other words: 
9 hours a day × 6 days a week = 54 hours a week × 52 weeks = 2 808 hours a year ÷ 12 months = 234 hours a month.
• Calculate the cost per hour. To do this, calculate the total expenses for a month, 
for example rent on the building, salaries, rental on offi ce equipment. Suppose it is 
R10 000 a month. Divide the total costs by the number of working hours per month: 
R10 000 ÷ 234 hours = R42,73 an hour. This means that you cannot charge less than 
R42,73 an hour for your services.

(c) Calculating the total costs per product for a commercial business
A commercial business does not manufacture products. It buys fi nished products and 
then sells them again at a higher price. The total costs for a product in a commercial 
business are made up of the purchasing costs of the product to be sold (the cost of sales) 
plus the commercial overhead costs.

4.7.2 Calculating the selling price
The price you can charge for your product or service is directly infl uenced by the price 
that your competitors charge for the same kind of product or service. If your product or 
service is much more expensive than that of your competitors, you will lose customers. 
Your product or service can only be more expensive than that of your competitors if you 
offer more benefi ts than your competitors – this means that the market must perceive 
that they are getting more value for money.
To determine what you can charge for your product, make a list of your products and 
then establish what your competitors charge for similar products. Next list the competi-
tors’ strengths and weaknesses, as well as your business’s strengths and weaknesses 
and compare them with those of the competitors. Table 4.3 provides a template for this 
activity.

You can now establish what the highest and lowest prices are and also what price range 
(the prices charged for the product or service in general) apply to the product or service. 
If a business has exceptional strengths, this can justify higher prices. The opposite is 
also true: if the business has many weaknesses it will be obliged to charge lower prices 
than its competitors. 
After you have made the comparison, you can decide what you can charge for your 
product or service. Remember that you may never charge less than the total cost of a 
product or service unless such a product is used as a loss leader to bring customers in 
the store. 
Once the selling price has been established, the potential income and net profi t from the 
sale of the product can be calculated.

4.7.3	 Calculating the expected net profit 
After establishing the costs and markup for your product, you are now ready to test 
the viability of the business. To be viable, the business idea must be profitable. To 
establish whether the business is going to be profitable, the expected unit sales must 
be multiplied by the expected selling price to arrive at the turnover. From this figure, 
deduct the expected costs. The difference will be the profit. If the income exceeds the 
expenses, you will be making a profit. If, on the other hand, your expenses exceed your 
income, you will be making a loss. 
The net profit is calculated by drawing up a pro forma income statement. 
A pro forma income statement is one that is drawn up using estimated figures. 
You can calculate the net profit using the figures you arrived at for the various scenarios 
discussed under Section 4.6.3. 
Here is an example of an income statement.

4.8	 CALCULATING THE BREAK-EVEN POINT
For any business, the gross sales volume level needed to reach the break-even point 
must be calculated. (Also see Chapter 15 for more information on the break-even point.)
Break-even is the volume where all fixed expenses are covered. 
   
To begin the break-even analysis, first estimate the business’s fixed expenses (also 
known as overheads) which mostly consist of monthly expenses but also expenses like 
insurance and taxes which are paid annually or quarterly. It is important to make the 
most accurate predictions of semi-variable expenses such as electricity and internet and 
communication costs even though their amounts will differ every month.
For the purpose of a model break-even calculation, let’s assume that the fixed expenses for 
Happy Traders are as follows: 
Administrative salaries 	
R1 500
Rent 	
R800
Utilities 	
R300
Insurance 	
R150
Taxes 	
R210
D

Supplies 	
R100
Sales and marketing 	
R300
Interest 	
R100
Miscellaneous 	
R400
Total fixed expenses	
R4 500
The business’s gross profit must be able to cover all these expenses. What must the total 
sales volume be if the gross profit margin is 30%? Answer: R15 000 total sales volume 
because 30% of that is R4 500.
If the gross profit margin of a business is 40% and your fixed expenses are R20 000, the 
break-even figure should be R50 000. Answer: R20 000 x 100 / 40 = R50 000.
Some expenses can be moved between being categorised as direct or indirect expenses 
which is why the profit and loss statements and break-even target number must be re-
evaluated at least once every six months.
Ways to lower break-even
There are three ways to lower your break-even volume; only two of them involve cost 
controls (which should always be your goal).
1.	 Lower direct costs, which will raise the gross margin: Be more diligent about 
purchasing material, controlling inventory or increasing the productivity of your 
labour by more cost-effective scheduling or adding more efficient technology. 
2.	 Exercise cost controls on your fixed expenses: Be careful when cutting expenses 
that you do so with an overall plan in mind. You can cut too deeply as well as too 
little and cause distress among workers, or you may pull back marketing efforts at 
the wrong time, which will send out the wrong signal to the market. 
3.	 Raise prices: Most entrepreneurs are reluctant to raise prices because they think that 
business will drop in sales. More often than not that does not happen unless you are 
in a very price-sensitive market, and if you are, you have probably already become 
volume driven. 
If you are in the typical niche-type small business, you can raise your prices 4–5% 
without your customers noticing. The effect can be startling. 
eg

Chapter 4: The viability of a business idea
91
For example, the first model we looked at was: 
Volume 	 	
	
	
R15 000
Direct cost 	
	
	
R10 500 		
(70%)
Gross profit 	
	
	
  R4 500
Raising the price by 5% would result in this change:
Volume 	 	
	
	
R15 750
Direct cost 	
	
	
R10 500 		
(67%)
Gross profit 	
	
	
  R5 250
You will have increased your margin by 3% and by so doing lowered the total volume you 
need to reach break-even.
The goal is profit 
You are in business to make a profit, not just to reach break-even. However, by knowing 
your break-even point, you can manage your business more effectively.
•	 Distribute your marketing efforts in order to reach your target, for instance, spend 
more resources on promotional activities if you want to increase sales.
•	 You can control costs if you predict a ‘slow’ month. This happens in most companies, 
for example the retail industry straight after Christmas. However, losses can be 
minimised if you plan accordingly. Remember that a few bad months can quickly 
wipe out accumulated profits. 
•	 You can maximise profits by knowing and understanding the elements of your 
break-even figure. 
4.9	 CASH PLANNING: THE CASH BUDGET 
	
(CASH FORECAST) 
Up to this point, we have stressed the importance of being able to sustain profits over 
time. 
Do not attempt any business venture if you cannot sustain profits over time.  
Unfortunately, making a profit is not enough. While you must be able to sustain profits 
over a period of time, it is equally important to have enough cash available to manage 
the business on a day-to-day basis. You may be making a net profit but lack sufficient 
eg
NB

92
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
ready cash (money) to meet expenses as they occur. If this happens, you cannot continue 
trading and you will go bankrupt and have to close your business.
When you do not have money to meet expenses as they occur, you are in a situation 
known as technical bankruptcy. So to continue in business, you must have an adequate 
cash flow to meet your expenses as they happen. 
To overcome this problem, it is extremely important that you pay close attention to the 
planning of actual money flowing into your business and actual money flowing out. It 
must be a first priority to know how much actual money you are going to receive and 
on what dates. You must also know when you have to pay expenses and what amounts 
are involved. A tool you can use to help with this cash planning is the cash budget.
The cash budget is a formal plan for forecasting future receipts and payments of cash. 
   
Just as you would not purchase a new car without enough cash or at least a solid plan to 
cover a personal loan from your bank, your business needs the same careful handling of its 
expenditures. All businesses, no matter what type or size, need to develop a plan for their 
expected cash intake and spending. This is the cash budget.
4.9.1	 The purpose of cash budgeting
The cash budget allows you to establish exactly how much cash is flowing into and out 
of your business. The budget can:
•	 be used to plan your short-term credit needs
•	 be presented to your bank or other financial institution to show proper financial 
planning
•	 help you predict months when there may be a cash shortfall
•	 highlight problem areas in your payment schedule – for example, payments to cred-
itors may be lumped together on one date – more careful planning could spread this 
evenly throughout the entire year.
4.9.2	 Consistent budgets
Consistency and accuracy is very important when engaging in the continuous process 
of cash budgeting. The process involves comparing budgeted amounts with amounts 
that can be expected from using typical ratios or financial statement relationships. For 
instance, your assessment will include all estimations of the payments made to your 
D
eg

Chapter 4: The viability of a business idea
93
suppliers, payments for wages and salaries as well as all the other payments that you 
must make. In order to take advantage of special reduced rates or discounts or to make 
sure that you do not miss payments, the payments can be scheduled by date. Also, 
cash collections from customers and other expected cash receipts can also be accurately 
planned and scheduled by date. Maintaining a healthy cash balance without holding 
excessive balances of non-productive cash will become easier when enough time and 
effort is put into planning. 
Example of a cash budget
The following is an example of a cash budget for the ABC Company.
Cash budget for 90 days

R450 000
Add:

Deduct:

 R200 000
Contractual payments on long-term debt	
R200 000
Quarterly dividend 	
R75 000
	
R1 475 000
Estimated ending cash balance 	
R175 000
4.9.3	 Analysis of the example cash budget
Analysis of the financial statements of the ABC Company shows the accounts receivable 
remain at about R500 000 throughout the year. This means there is no seasonal 
fluctuation in sales.
•	 The accounts receivable turns over six times a year, or once every 60 days.
•	 The inventory throughout the year remains at about R800 000 and turns over every 
90 days.
•	 The accounts payable remains at about R400 000 and turns over eight times a year; 
about once every 45 days.
•	 There is an accounts receivable collection period of 60 days and an average balance 
outstanding of R500 000. It appears that R750 000 is the amount that should be 
collected on the receivables in 90 days.
eg

94
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
•	 Cash sales should amount to about R250 000 if the inventory of R800 000 valued 
at cost turns over once in 90 days and if the average markup is about R200 000. 
Therefore, if an inventory of R1 000 000 at retail turns over once every 90 days and 
R750 000 flows through accounts receivable, then approximately R250 000 must be 
sold on a cash basis. 
•	 Cash payments for expenses are estimated to be R150 000 in the next 90 days. This 
figure can be roughly checked by referring to the expenses of the income statement. 
A rough measure of the cash expenses can usually be obtained by using the operating 
expenses less any non-cash expenses such as depreciation. For example, if there 
is no seasonal factor, the total amount divided by four should be an approximate 
check on the amount budgeted for the next 90 days. 
4.10		 SUMMARY 
In this chapter we discussed the first stage in the planning process, namely performing 
a viability study. We discussed the reason for carrying out such a study and explained 
the various steps in the process. 
When conducting the viability study, it is important to conduct market research to es-
tablish exactly who your customers will be, whether there is a real need for the product 
or service behind your idea, and who your competitors will be. It is also necessary to 
calculate what your income will be; to do this you need to be able to calculate the cost 
price of your product or service, calculate the selling price and from those figures estab-
lish what your profit will be. You must be able to draw up a cash budget and calculate 
the break-even point of the business. 
The reason behind the viability study was stressed; to be viable, your business idea 
must be profitable and sustainable over a period of time.

The business plan

Chapter
5.1 LEARNING OUTCOMES 
After you have studied this chapter, you should be able to:  
• understand the purpose of a business plan 
• identify and describe the potential users of a business plan 
• explain the character of a business plan 
• understand the preparation phase in writing a business plan 
• comprehend the different structures of a business plan 
• draft a basic business plan.  
5.2 INTRODUCTION 
In Chapter 4 we discussed the fi rst half of our business planning: namely, how to do the 
viability study. If you have decided that your business idea is indeed viable, then you 
can move on to the next step – the business plan. This plan is a critical element in every 
phase of the entrepreneurial route to success.
The business plan plays a pivotal role in the entrepreneurial process. If you, as an en-
trepreneur, apply for start-up capital, a government grant or if you tender for a govern-
ment contract, one of the fi rst questions you will be asked is if you have a business plan. 
Also private equity providers, like venture capitalists, require a comprehensive plan 
with the core purpose to indicate how their investment will return high yields. This 
suggests that a business plan is the only platform for judging your business, although 
on paper. Remember that the business opportunity is the core focus of entrepreneurial 
venturing. A business plan is a picture and blueprint of how the entrepreneur will par-
ticipate in the entrepreneurial process. 
Let us assess two entrepreneurial cases. 

98
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
Refilwe Ngobeni, a third year business management student at a local university, invented 
an app that links the Johannesburg Securities Exchange (JSE) with cellphone and tablet end-
users. This program enabled the customer to obtain information on any real time changes 
on share prices (both inclines and declines). At that time, the concept was unique and 
promised high income potential for the entrepreneur. Refilwe finished her formal studies 
and started the business formally. She spent hours refining the service but failed to develop 
a pricing strategy or even think about a marketing strategy. All her advisors said: ‘Just do 
it’; ‘The money will come by itself’; ‘These apps will go viral and make millions in a short 
timeframe’ and, ‘This is a million dollar opportunity.’
The reality was that not a single customer was interested because of the vast number of 
competitive/comparable apps that were developed within a very short time. Refilwe fell in 
love with her idea and neglected all the basic business principles. The total income of the 
business amounted to zero! The expense account exceeded the zero mark by far!
Peter opened a small outlet near his home to sell basic consumer goods like maize, milk 
and cooldrinks and even offered a public phone. As the sales increased, he realised that 
an opportunity existed for making yoghurt out of the milk that had not been sold and had 
date-expired; also a farmer close to Peter offered all his surplus milk not sold in the open 
market. He decided to expand and opened a small yoghurt factory. Peter was then also able 
to expand his sales area with the new product with specific reference to the large number of 
Spaza shops in his region. Because the business was doing well, Peter could again expand 
and build a cheese-making unit.
All these decisions were based on well-researched opportunities in the marketplace and on 
sound financial planning. Because of this planning, and given the vigorous growth of the 
business, Peter is investigating the possibility of buying the dairy farm currently supplying him.
These are typical scenarios drawn from the lives of emerging entrepreneurs. Because of a 
lack of planning, the first case ends in failure, whereas the second shows entrepreneurial 
performance and success. One of the cornerstones of success is in-depth planning; the 
business plan is an integral part of this planning process.
5.3	 THE PURPOSE AND PRINCIPLES OF THE BUSINESS PLAN
The primary objective of the business plan is to develop a blueprint to define your 
business. The plan is:
•	 a meticulous route map to entrepreneurial success 
•	 a detailed written document stipulating how you will address all the business 
activities to exploit the identified business opportunity
eg
eg

Chapter 5: The business plan
99
• a planning document that explores and indicates the route to follow into the future
• a document that you, the entrepreneur, should formulate by yourself.
Consider Figure 5.1 and the points discussed below before compiling your plan.

Figure 5.1: The business plan 
5.3.1 A blueprint for the business
The business plan serves exactly the same purpose as an architect’s plan, which includes 
a detailed building schedule with quantities and costs of all the items necessary to 
complete the work, such as bricks, mortar, wood, steel and labour. In the same way, the 
business plan lists all the facets of the proposed business.
5.3.2 A fl exible document
The business plan is not a static or fi xed document; it is a dynamic planning instrument 
that should be updated regularly to take account of changes in the business environ-
ment. For instance, customer buying patterns may shift towards healthier eating (for 
example, a trend towards low fat yoghurt); new competitors may enter the market with 
new, comparable products (for example, soya milk yoghurt). Your suppliers may also 
change their approach (for example, no more credit offerings, which could have a nega-
tive impact on cash fl ow). Timely adaptation to these changes is the only way for your 
business to survive.
5.3.3 A plan developed by the entrepreneur 
The only way to understand your business properly is to develop your own business 
plan. This is the best way to end up with a unique plan that suits you and your business 
and coupled with that offers you the opportunity to strategically and operationally 
think of all the elements of your business. Whilst it is possible to use the services of an 
external consultant, this may not be as effective and you may end up with an ‘off-the-
shelf’, generic product. 

100
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
5.4 OTHER USERS OF THE BUSINESS PLAN 
A secondary objective of the business plan is to acquire fi nance from a fi nancier (eg a 
commercial bank or fi nancial agency). It can also serve as a marketing document to 
present to potential investors or venture capitalists. The larger suppliers of raw material 
may similarly ask to see the plan to evaluate your reputation, substance and fi nancial 
position. 
Some entrepreneurs use the business plan to motivate their employees; by communi-
cating the long-term planning and goals, they hope to give their staff a greater sense of 
‘ownership’. However, there is a certain danger in making your plans known because 
the core competencies and intellectual capital may become known to your competitors 
if and when employees leave your service. A business plan is a confi dential document 
and anyone who reads it should sign a non-disclosure agreement which states that they 
will maintain confi dentiality. 
Figure 5.2 summarises the other users of a business plan.

Financing entities (eg Business Partners & SEFA)

5.5 THE BUSINESS MODEL 
A key component of any sound business plan is the design and formulation of an 
effective business model. All the elements of the business model are eventually trans-
lated into the business plan. Why then a business model? 
The model is a clear indication of how you and your business will fi rst create value for 
customers (in the modern world with its unique market dynamics, people want more 
value than ever before), and second what contributes to the effi ciency of the business 
venture to create value for customers. The following elements should be included in 
your business model (and it is advised to formulate these before you commence with 
the business plan).

Chapter 5: The business plan
101
5.5.1	 Value creation
(a)	The Value proposition: This section indicates clearly what you sell or render of value 
to the customer. The unique selling proposition (usp) is also included, meaning how 
you will differentiate your offering from your competitors’. It is also critical to ask 
and address the following three questions:
•	 What are we selling? (product description)
•	 What problem do we solve for customers by selling this product?
•	 What value do we create with the offering?
(b)	Target customers: Many entrepreneurs think that their product/s will be used by 
‘everyone’. That is one of the most popular mistakes we make. One has to focus on 
a specific group of customers with more or less the same needs to be satisfied. This 
is called the target market/s.
(c)	Channels: How do you get the product to the target customer? At first you have 
to make the selected target market/s aware of your existence. Your advertising or 
communication strategy should be formulated here. After that, the distribution 
channels should be outlined (eg in retail, the customer will walk into your store, 
thus a very short chain; but if you have a business-to-business proposition, a logis-
tical process should be designed). 
(d)	Customer service: How do you first attract new customers; second create loyalty 
and third get them to tell others (word-of-mouth). 
(e)	Income model: How will your business make money? A brief description of your 
income streams (eg by selling goods, rental or an annuity model). 
5.5.2	 Efficiency
(a)	External parties: In this section you analyse all the external entities that could poten-
tially contribute to the efficiency of your business. The first starting point is your sup-
pliers of input goods (eg raw material or packaging material); Government agencies 
(eg SEDA or SEFA); organisational bodies (eg your chamber of commerce), etc. 
(b)	Operational activities: The operational process in your business should be well 
described because it will contribute eventually to effective cost analysis and cutting. 
Here we describe all the primary activities (eg customer orders – deposit payment – 
design – manufacturing – packaging – distribution and delivery); as well as all the 
support activities (eg human resource management and/or IT support). 
(c)	Resources: Any business is driven by factors of production or input resources. It 
certainly depends on the nature of your business but the following core resources 
are normally present in a generic small business venture:

102
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
• human resources (eg sales people)
• capital (eg starting and working capital)
• raw material
• intellectual property (eg a patent)
• technology (eg tools and equipment).
(d) Costing: The costing structure of any small business is critical in many ways, it 
not only assists in determining the viability of the start-up but also supports 
you in determining the pricing of your product to be offered to customers. Two 
fundamental cost types should be described here, fi xed costs (eg staying the same 
over one year, like salaries and rental) as well as variable costs (eg it changes the 
more you produce, like raw material or labelling). 
Your business model then prepares you to complete the entire business plan as discussed 
in the class. 
The business plan, compiled after the model, is a planning instrument that shows 
the entrepreneurial process and describes how the entrepreneur will implement the 
process. However, it is not the nucleus of success. Many potential entrepreneurs 
may think that if a business plan is on paper, success will follow. Business success 
and entrepreneurial performance are dependent on much more. Initially, you would 
have identifi ed a feasible opportunity in the market environment. As discussed and 
explained in Chapter 4, you would then have undertaken a viability study. A viable 
opportunity therefore pre-empts the written business plan. The viability study creates 
a platform for writing the business plan. 
Table 5.1 distinguishes between the opportunity and the business plan.

5.6	 THE STRUCTURE OF THE BUSINESS PLAN 
The structure of a business plan is extremely important. It is advisable to structure your 
plan so that it meets the needs of your industry and the needs of the potential reader or 
user. A service-rendering business, for instance, will simply not have a production plan. 
NB

It must be re-emphasised that the structure of your business plan should adjust to the 
reader. Structure 1 is an all-inclusive plan and suitable to be used as the blueprint of 
the business. 
In the case of financing institutions, you will have to adapt to their requirements and 
proposed structure. 
5.7	 GUIDELINES FOR WRITING THE BUSINESS PLAN 
The structure and the content of your business plan will be unique to your business. 
Here are some guidelines to help with writing the actual plan.
•	 Keep the plan respectably short: Stick to a concise but clear plan (do not exceed 50 
pages).
•	 Organise and package the plan appropriately: Follow a logical structure with a 
professional presentation (for instance, a cover page with the company name, logo 
and contact details, presented in such a way that the reader is interested in what is 
to follow). 
•	 Orient the plan toward the future: You should clearly indicate what you intend to 
do in the future and also include a trend analysis and forecast. 
•	 Avoid exaggeration: Do not inflate the potential of the business (for example, be 
realistic about sales and revenue estimates). 
•	 Highlight critical risks: This part shows the reader that you are aware of potential 
problems and gives you the opportunity to explain ways to manage them. 
•	 Give evidence of an effective entrepreneurial team: The management part of the 
plan is of critical importance as it should convey the skills and contribution of each 
member of your team to the overall objectives of the business. 
•	 Do not over diversify: The plan should focus only on that segment of the market 
you identified during your market research (see page 74). 
•	 Identify the target market: Give particulars of your target market and explain how 
you carried out your market research. 

108
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
•	 Keep the plan written in the third person: rather use ‘he’, ‘they’ or ‘them’ than ‘I’, 
‘we’ or ‘us’. 
•	 Capture the reader’s interest: Financial institutions receive many requests for 
funds. Concentrate on clearly defining the uniqueness of your proposed business. 
5.8	 WRITING THE BUSINESS PLAN 
You are now ready to start writing your plan. As an example, we are going to use 
Peter’s business referred to earlier in this chapter. The full plan forms Appendix A at the 
back of this book, but a summary of the information that should appear in your plan is 
covered on the following pages. 
5.8.1	 The cover page 
The cover page should contain the proposed name of the business, its address and 
relevant contact details. It should also be dated with a date relevant to the content and 
existence of the plan. 
5.8.2	 The confidentiality agreement 
A business plan contains confidential information on the business make-up, core com-
petencies, competitive advantages and financial condition of the business venture and 
the entrepreneur. It is therefore critical to safeguard the content by asking the reader/s 
to sign a confidentiality agreement. 
5.8.3	 The table of contents 
The table of contents guides the reader to the information and should be accurately 
linked to the content of the plan (insert all the main and sub-headings accompanied by 
the relevant page number/s). 
5.8.4	 Executive summary 
This summarises the entire plan in two to three pages. It provides the reader with  
an overview of the status of the business, the basic description of the business and 
owner/s, potential and current (if relevant) customers, and a brief summary of the  
financials. It also indicates the purpose of the business plan (for example, financial  
requirements or investment potential in terms of shareholding). It is advisable to com-
plete the executive summary after the entire business plan has been finalised. 

Chapter 5: The business plan
109
5.8.5	 Business description 
This section explains in detail exactly what the business intends to do in the market 
place, in what industry it will operate, the trends and characteristics of the industry 
and what the business sells or intends to sell to its customers (the unique characteristics 
of the product/s). It furthermore points out the objectives to be achieved in the short, 
medium and long term. 
5.8.6	 Marketing plan 
The marketing plan illustrates exactly how the product/s will reach the customer. This 
section highlights the intended target market, what type of media will be used to attract 
these customers and what pricing strategy will be applied. It also explains the proposed 
distribution strategy as well as the competition in the selected market. The best way to 
compile a marketing plan is to base it on proper marketing research findings. 
5.8.7	 Location 
This section of the plan explains why specific decisions were made with regards to the 
establishment of the business. Such things as the proximity to suppliers and customers, 
the zoning of the property as well as transport factors should form part of this section. 
Another relevant aspect is the availability of skilled labour as a source to the business. 
The information contained in this section should be based on the findings of the 
feasibility study. 
5.8.8	 Management 
This section must show how management will achieve the objectives that have been  
set for the business. It should illustrate the human competence of the business and in-
clude details of the management team and organisational structure (if applicable), the 
legal structure and available professional support. 
5.8.9	 Financial plan 
The financial plan is to a certain extent the most critical component of the business 
plan. This section directly specifies what resources are required and how these will be 
financed and managed. The historical financial performance of the business should be 
included (in the case of an established entity), or the pro forma or projected financial 
forecasting in terms of the future expectations. 
The nature and purpose of the business plan will depict the timeframe of forecasting 
(for instance, three years or five years ahead). The main body of the financial plan 
should contain the projected cash flow and income statements as well as balance sheets. 

110
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
A break-even analysis must also support the plan. The example (Peter’s business) has 
a projection of one year only for the cash flow statements because of lack of space. It 
is advisable, however, to do realistic projections over a much longer timeframe (for 
example, three years). 
5.8.10		 Critical risks 
The risk assessment section must explain all the potential risks that could influence 
the normal and future operations of the business. These risk factors may be incurred 
by variables in the macro environment (such as legislation), market environment (such 
as competition) and micro environment (such as managerial issues). The reader has to 
understand how the management team will react and manage all the potential threats 
or risks upon its occurrence. It therefore explores all the ‘what if’ issues. 
5.8.11		 Appendices 
These should include all the additional detailed documentation as mentioned in the 
body of the plan, such as:
•	 market research 
•	 curricula vitae 
•	 product specifications and photos. 
5.9	 SUMMARY 
Every entrepreneur should remember the saying that ‘if one fails to plan, one plans 
to fail’. A business plan is primarily a planning instrument and blueprint of the busi-
ness venture, whether new or old. The structure of the plan should be adjusted to the 
nature of the business and its purpose (for instance, attracting finance). Always keep 
the reader in mind with specific reference to his or her level of knowledge. The length 
of the plan is less important than the quality of the content. All the components of the 
plan should communicate with each other and be strengthened by a well-structured 
executive summary. Remember, this business tool is flexible and needs continuous ad-
aptation and improvement!

Product decisions:
deciding what to
offer to customers 
6
Chapter
6.1 LEARNING OUTCOMES 
After you have studied this chapter, you should be able to:  
• defi ne a product and explain what it is 
• explain what a product mix is and decide on the product mix for your business 
• describe the different product strategies 
• select a suitable brand name for your product 
• explain the function of packaging and design a good package for your product 
• describe the implications of warranties. 
6.2 INTRODUCTION 
Deciding on the product to be offered to the customer is a process that requires much 
thinking and deliberation as it will eventually determine the success or failure of the 
business. If the market does not like what you offer or do not buy into the offering, this 
will be the end of the business. If the correct product is selected this will imply that the 
business:
• meets the needs of the target market and that these needs are satisfi ed 
• meets the businesses own objectives (eg profi tability). 
It often happens that the small businessperson does not carefully consider the product 
to offer and makes hasty decisions. This can lead to scarce funds being invested in a 
product for which there is no demand and no market. The end result is that there are no 
sales, or insuffi cient sales, to justify the money invested, thereby leading to the business 
going bankrupt. By carefully selecting the product to offer, the small business has a 
better chance of success. 

Chapter 6: Product decisions: deciding what to offer to customers 
113
6.3	 CLASSIFICATION OF PRODUCTS
Products can be classified into different categories and it is the responsibility of the 
small business owner to decide on the type of product to offer, and then to focus on 
the successful marketing of the product. Ultimately the type of product selected will 
influence the way it is marketed. 
There are three major types of products (Cant, Strydom, Jooste & Du Plessis, 2013:200).
6.3.1	 Durable products 
Durable products refer to those products that have a long life span and are not con-
sumed quickly. They are normally more complex and expensive. Typical durable prod-
ucts will be microwave ovens, steam irons, kettles, beds and refrigerators etc. The fact 
that they last for some time means that they are not replaced very often. 
6.3.2	 Non-durable products 
Non-durable products refer to those products that are consumed over a short period. 
They include products such as groceries, milk and paper. They are bought fairly fre-
quently and should be easily available to the customer. The pricing of these products is 
usually fairly competitive. 
6.3.3	 Services 
Whereas durable and non-durable products are generally tangible products, services 
are usually intangible. Services are products that offer instant benefits as opposed to 
products that involve using, buying or owning. The issue is that customers often can-
not see a service, so the challenge for the small business is to show the value of the 
service. Examples of services include beauty treatments, laundry services and tutoring. 
Table 6.1 shows some services and service providers on offer.

Another way of classifying products is by means of the target market group. These 
include:
•	 consumer products (offered to individual customers) 
•	 industrial or business products (offered to other businesses). 
6.3.4	 Consumer products
According to Jooste, Berndt, Herbst and Klopper (2005:4), a consumer product can 
best be described or defined as a product bought by an individual for his or her own 
use. Consumer products can be divided into three major types namely convenience, 
shopping and speciality products. Whether a product falls into this category is 
determined by looking at the customer’s behaviour when buying the product. Let us 
look at each of these types of classifications. 
(a)  Convenience products 
Convenience products are exactly as the name suggests – products that the customer 
wants to buy with the least effort, i.e. with convenience. These products are bought 
frequently and in small quantities. Their prices are usually low and the numbers of 
outlets offering these products are large. Think about a customer who wants to buy 
chips or butter. He or she does not want to go to too much trouble to buy the item 
but would rather buy them conveniently nearby. Think of all the ‘convenience’ stores 
at garages selling these items the customer wants. Examples of convenience products 
are flour, butter, milk, ice cream and chips. Many of these products are bought on the 
spur of the moment, for example cigarettes, magazines and chewing gum, which you 
often find at the checkout till of supermarkets or cafés. Consumers know all they need 

Chapter 6: Product decisions: deciding what to offer to customers 
115
to know about convenience products and not much effort is put into the purchases. 
Consumers will not hesitate to select a different brand if their preferred brand is not 
available at a convenient location. 
(b)  Shopping products 
A shopping product is something a customer will put some effort into before he or she 
buys it. Mainly because customers do not have sufficient information on the product, 
they compare prices where brand preference is not so strong. Customers tend to shop 
around before buying the product. They compare all the alternatives in terms of price, 
quality, design and the like. Examples of shopping products are steam irons, appliances 
and couches. The small business that offers these types of products will have to know 
what things are important to their customers and use these to differentiate their offering 
from that of competitors. The number of outlets is limited and they are normally located 
close to competitors due to the fact that customers tend to compare prices, quality and 
so on. 
(c)  Speciality products 
In the case of speciality products the customer has a fairly good knowledge of the product 
and has a strong brand preference and is prepared to go far to buy the product. He or 
she will make a special effort to obtain the product. Examples of speciality products are 
exclusive leather handbags and shoes, boutique clothing, brand name cookware and 
coffee makers. These products are usually available only at selected outlets. It might be 
that only one outlet offers the product in a specific area which will give the customer a 
sense of exclusivity. This in itself is a differentiating factor. An important aspect of this 
type of consumer product is that it requires that the customer knows what makes the 
product or the place selling the product so ‘special’. 
Consumer products are generally bought by individuals or households for their own 
personal use. 
6.3.5	 Industrial products
Industrial or business products are bought by a business for use in making other 
products or providing other services (Jooste et al, 2005:9). The following are examples 
of different types of industrial products.
(a)  Capital equipment 
Capital equipment can be defined as typically equipment/machinery used in the 
process of producing other products or services. Examples of this type of equipment 
are office equipment, sewing machines and agricultural machines. These products tend 
to be fairly expensive and last a long time. They usually require fairly high levels of 
technical knowledge and servicing/maintenance that extend past the time of purchase 
of the product. 

116
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
(b)  Materials and components 
Materials and components are products actually used to make or deliver the final 
product. They might be raw materials (for example wood for paper milling) or 
processed materials (for example, switches for use in assembling reading lamps). 
Materials – whether raw or processed – usually become part of the product (in other 
words, they change their form). Components also become part of the product but they 
do not change their form. Examples of components are spark plugs, buttons, and nuts 
and bolts. These products are usually bought on a contract basis and require some 
negotiation and assurances of stock and quality. 
(c)  Operating supplies 
Operating supplies are products that are used by a business but not in the manufactur-
ing of the products themselves. Examples of operating supplies are petrol or diesel, 
cleaning materials, pens and notepads. They are relatively inexpensive, have a fairly 
short life span, and are bought without much effort. This type of product must be read-
ily available to those who want it and it must be competitively priced. 
(d)  Industrial services 
Industrial services are those services used by a business to support the production pro-
cess but are not actually part of the production process itself. Examples are training, 
cleaning services, research and auditing, and food and catering services. The important 
thing about this type of service is that the customers need to be made aware of how the 
service you offer can help them to perform their tasks better and reach their objectives.
(e)  Industrial services
Industrial products are bought by a business for use in making other products or services.
The above discussion gives an overview of the types of products. It is the small busi-
nessperson’s responsibility to decide on the offering to the market, that is, what the 
product–service mix should be.
6.4	 THE PRODUCT–SERVICE MIX
There are no set rules as to what the product–service mix should be. This mix can be 
only one item which the entrepreneur offers or it may be a range of similar products or a 
limited range of diverse products and/or services. These products and services may all 
have some sort of common bond such as fishing and camping gear or there may be no 
or a limited bond such as offering camping gear as well as selling golf clubs. You, as an 
entrepreneur, will have to decide exactly what it is that you will offer your customers.
6.4.1	 The product mix
An organisation with a variety of product lines has a product mix. A product mix con-
sists of all the product lines and product items that you offer. Let us look in more detail 
at these terms (Cant et al, 2013:210). 

Chapter 6: Product decisions: deciding what to offer to customers 
117
Product line 
A product line is a group of products within the product mix that contains similar prod-
uct items. For example, in the case of a clothing store the product lines might include 
babygrows, sleepwear, socks and shoes, premature clothing, toys, gifts and accessories.
Product item 
A product item is a specific item within a product line. For example, in the evening 
gown line for a women’s clothing store each individual dress has a specific style and 
brand name. Each of these individual dresses is a product item. 
You should be able to see that all decisions that the small business entrepreneur makes 
about products will always relate to and affect the product items, product lines and 
product mix.
•	 The more product lines that your business has, the wider your product mix. 
•	 The more product items that you have within a product line, the deeper your 
product line. 
The product mix is the total range of various products that your business makes or sells. 
As the small business usually (or often) has limited funds, care must be taken to ‘not be 
everything to everybody’. This means that it may be wise to focus on a limited number 
of product lines and a limited number of items per product line. This will reduce your 
investment in inventory as well as other costs such as storage fees, insurance and the 
threat of obsolescence. 
6.4.2	 The service mix
Businesses can offer products and services, ranging from a basically pure tangible 
product to a pure intangible service product (Theron & Strydom, 2009:7).
It is possible to classify services in terms of the service component of the product. 
Some businesses offer only a pure service product (eg attorneys) and others sell only a 
tangible product (eg butchery). There are many small businesses, however, that offer 
a combination of products and services (eg a garden landscaping company that offers 
both the landscaping and designing service as well as the plants and accessories it uses). 
Below are four possible categories where service levels differ (Theron & Strydom, 
2009:7).
(a)  Pure tangible product 
In the case of a pure tangible product, the business has a minor or no supporting service 
component. Examples of businesses with a pure tangible product are grocery stores, 
direct mail businesses and party decoration stores. 

118
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
(b)  Tangible products with supporting services 
In the case of a product with supporting services, it is not only the product being sold 
but also the warranties, the after-sales service, installation and money-back guarantee. 
This whole package makes the product valuable to the customer. Many of these prod-
ucts are fairly complex and need the help of good salespeople to sell them. Examples 
of these products are office equipment, expensive clothing, computer equipment, ste-
reo equipment and home appliances. The supporting services often take the form of 
warranties, installation services, repair services or alterations. The combination of the 
product and the supporting services will help customers to decide whether to deal with 
the company or its competitor! 
(c)  Service with supporting products 
This type of product/service package is also known as a hybrid product. Here the 
product will not be purchased without the accompanying service, for example buying 
a new car with a service plan. The product will not be purchased without the assistance 
of the manufacturer to ensure that it is correctly used and maintained. 
(d)  Pure service 
In the case of a pure service, hardly any supporting products are needed. Examples are 
hairdressers and barbers and beauty therapists who provide only a service. 
A product–service mix is the sum of all the products and/or services offered by a 
business. Based on the needs and buying patterns of the target market it is important 
that the entrepreneur makes the correct decision regarding the product–service mix. 
6.4.3  Factors affecting the optimal product mix 
There are a number of factors that affect what the optimal product mix looks like. These 
factors include: 
(a)  The overall business objectives
More often than not the objectives set in terms of profits and market share will affect 
how broad the product mix is. If the business wants to be seen as the market and 
product leader in imported wines, for example, this will imply that they will need a 
broad and deep product mix. 
(b)  Changes in the marketplace 
The current worldwide recession has had a profound effect on the markets of most, if 
not all, products and services. This has led to widescale unemployment and had a direct 
influence on what people spend their money on. This may mean that consumers look 

Chapter 6: Product decisions: deciding what to offer to customers 
119
for cheaper, lower-quality products or even different types of products. You must be 
aware of the changing needs of your customers in order to know what changes you may 
need to make to your product mix. For example, many companies who used to sell only 
the top brands in televisions and laptops have added cheaper, lesser-known brands to 
their range in order to cater for the new tastes of their markets. Similarly retailers who 
traditionally did not carry certain products will start offering these products due to the 
changing needs and buying patterns of customers. Think of Woolworths over the past 
few years. Traditionally Woolworths carried only their own brands but due to market 
forces started adding well-known brands such as Kellogg’s and others to their range. 
(c)  Competitors’ actions 
You may decide to make your product offering different from that of your competitors. 
You may also offer products for which the competition is not so strong. 
(d)  Production considerations 
You may be able to make more efficient use of your production facilities by adjusting 
your product mix, especially if you have finances and spare production resources to 
allow you to do so. For example, a manufacturer of leather briefcases might expand 
his or her product mix by making leather belts on the machinery during the time when 
demand for briefcases is low. 
6.5	 PRODUCT DECISIONS
The small business owner needs to make serious decisions regarding its product mix.
There are numerous types of decisions to consider. Some of these are discussed next 
(Strydom, 2004:193).
6.5.1	 Product diversification
Product diversification is the process of expanding the product mix by adding new 
product items or product lines to the existing mix. These products may or may not be 
related to the existing range. For example, a textile designer who designs fabric might 
diversify into upholstery and curtain making.
6.5.2	 Product specialisation
Product specialisation is the process of eliminating some product items or product lines 
from the product mix. For example, a gift shop selling cards, wrapping paper and party 
decorations may decide to specialise by selling only party decorations. You also get 
stores who may specialise in only one item such as balloons. A wide and deep range is 
offered in such a store.

120
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
6.5.3	 Product simplification
Product simplification is the process of limiting the shape, sizes or appearance of certain 
products. For example, a manufacturer of umbrellas may decide to make only three 
sizes, five colours and four styles of umbrellas. This is usually done to reduce costs and 
to concentrate on the fast-moving items. 
6.5.4	 Product differentiation 
Product differentiation is the process of trying to make your product, which is essen-
tially the same as that of your competitor, different from the competitors’ products in 
the eyes of the customers in the target market. For example, a manufacturer of flour 
may decide to differentiate his or her product from that of competitors by using slightly 
larger packaging and indicating 20% more for free. This makes it difficult for the cus-
tomer to compare as the volume is different and the prices cannot be directly compared. 
6.5.5	 Product obsolescence 
Product obsolescence is the process of developing new products to last a specific time – 
physically or psychologically. Physical obsolescence means that the product will wear 
out, for example a briefcase designed to last for five years. Psychological obsolescence 
means that the product does not actually wear out but a new model or style makes it old 
or outdated, for example when a new version of a cellphone is released, the outdated 
technology is still useful but the cellphone becomes known as being outdated. The 
manufacturer does this in order to gain repeat sales. 
6.6	 BRANDING AND TRADEMARKS 
Branding and trademarks are used to identify products in the marketplace. According 
to Cant et al (2013:213), a brand can be defined as: ‘A name, term, design, symbol or any 
other feature that identifies your product as different from those of the competitors’.
A brand is a name, sign, symbol, design or combination of these which identifies a product 
or service.   
Why are brands so important and why do companies like to ‘build their brand’? Brands 
are used to differentiate the products or services of a business from those of its competi-
tors. When we talk about Cell C we tend to have a specific image of the company and 
what it stands for, while the image for MTN will conjure up a different impression. In 
other words, you use branding to identify your product or services for your customer. 
Second, when you build a good reputation for a brand, it makes it easier for you to  
introduce a new product or service to the market by using the same name. This is called 
brand extension. 
D

Chapter 6: Product decisions: deciding what to offer to customers 
121
Brand extension is using an existing brand name to help with the introduction of new 
products.   
A trademark is a brand or part of a brand that has been granted legal protection – it 
protects the seller’s exclusive rights to use the brand (Jooste et al, 2005:45). The business 
that registered the trademark gets exclusive use of that trademark and no competitor is 
legally allowed to use it. Examples of trademarks are McDonald’s, Nivea and Samsung. 
There are legal implications for the small business entrepreneur registering a trademark 
but if they want to build their brand and make sure no one else grabs it, it needs to be 
protected and that means that it is imperative that it be registered. 
A trademark is a brand that has been granted legal protection. 
   
6.6.1	 Types of brands 
There are many types of brands that the small business entrepreneur can decide to use 
(Cant et al, 2013:217). First, there is a choice between a manufacturer (national) brand 
and a private brand.
Manufacturer (national) brand 
A manufacturer brand is owned and used by a manufacturer of a product and is usually 
sold nationally (in other words, across South Africa, in different kinds of outlets). 
Examples of manufacturer brands are Ford, Hilton Hotel and Nescafe coffee. 
Private brand 
In the case of a private brand, products are sold under a brand name created by a re-
tailer or a wholesaler. Many South African supermarket chains offer popular products 
in their own private brands (for example: SPAR Housebrands Sugar). Private brands 
are not promoted to the extent that national brands are and are therefore not as widely 
recognisable. 
Second, there is a choice between a family, individual or company name within a brand.
Family brand
For the family brand, the seller uses the same brand on an entire line or mix of product 
items. For example, Apple sells all its products, such as iPad and iPod, under the Apple 
name.
D
D

122
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
Individual brand 
For the individual brand, the product is known by its own name instead of the name 
of the company making the product. For example, Procter and Gamble sells multiple 
brands like Dove and Pampers. 
Company name with a brand 
Some manufacturers choose to use their company name together with an individual 
product brand name. The individual name differentiates the product from others, 
whilst the company name adds a firm’s reputation to the product, for example Cadbury 
Dairy Milk and Cadbury Flake.
6.6.2	 Importance of brands 
Brands are important for both customers and manufacturers (Cant et al, 2013:215–216). 
Manufacturers’ brands provide the following advantages:
•	 Brands are the central point around which the advertising and merchandising of the 
product revolve as you can make customers aware of the brand and also get them 
to recognise it. 
•	 They create loyalty. Manufacturers should aim to build a brand to such an extent 
where brand loyalty and trust of the brand is more important than price sensitivity. 
Price premiums can be charged for a strong brand which will prevent frequent 
brand switching. 
•	 They create a differential advantage. Strong branding can help a manufacturer to 
compete across the whole market and creates a competitive advantage. 
•	 They create price premiums. An established brand is in a position to demand higher 
prices. 
•	 They protect the marketer from other sellers’ substituting similar products for their 
product. 
•	 They allow the marketer to expand or diversify the product mix. 
For customers, brands provide the following advantages:
•	 They identify and locate the product more easily at the point of sale. 
•	 They imply a reliable level of quality since all products with the same brand name 
should have the same quality level. 
•	 They offer protection to customers, because they usually identify the manufacturer 
of the brand. 

Chapter 6: Product decisions: deciding what to offer to customers 
123
•	 They can serve as a warning to customers if the product has previously not met their 
expectations! 
•	 They create interest and character for the product image. A brand personality makes 
it easier for customers to form attitudes and feelings about the product. 
6.6.3	 Guidelines for selecting a brand name
There are a few general guidelines that the small business entrepreneur should keep in 
mind when selecting a brand name.
•	 The name must be easy for the target market to pronounce and remember. 
•	 Try to select a name that is suggestive of the major benefits of the product. 
•	 It must ideally be a name which can be legally protected. 
•	 Try to select a name that can be used on several product lines. 
•	 The name should be original. 
•	 Choose a name that can be associated with quality. 
6.7	 PACKAGING
Once a brand name has been decided on, the packaging needs attention. Traditionally 
the main function of packaging was to protect the product, but this role has changed 
over the years. Packaging is now a marketing tool and in many cases customers buy the 
package and not the product. 
Packaging is extremely important, as many products rely only on their packaging (size, 
shape, colour, etc) to attract attention on the shelf. In the case of many products, you 
think of the packaging more than the product itself. Think of Rice Crispies cereal – 
chances are that you imagine the box the product comes in rather than the plastic bag 
the cereal comes in.
Packaging is the design and production of the container of the product item so that it can 
be protected, stored, handled, transported, identified and marketed successfully.   
Figure 6.1 summarises the roles of packaging.
D

124
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
Enclosure and protection
• Protects the product, facilitates storage and handling of product.
Reusability
• Packaging can be reused for other purposes.
Communication
• Communicates details about product and product images is communicated through the 
packaging’s covering.
Market segmentation
• Product packaging is designed to suit market segment, for examples baby bottles that 
do not shatter when they fail.
Distribution
• Packaging facilitates dispatching of product and storage in warehouses or storage 
areas.
Product development
• Packaging can be considered as a part of the product development.
Differentiation
• Allows the product to be different from that of the competitors.
Figure 6.1: Functions of packaging
6.7.1 Types of packaging
The small business entrepreneur must decide what type of packaging to use for his or 
her products. A number of choices are available (Cant et al, 2013:223). 

Chapter 6: Product decisions: deciding what to offer to customers 
125
(a)  Family packaging
In the case of family packaging, all the products in the product mix have more or less 
the same packaging, for example ranges of shower gel/soap and body lotion.
(b)  Special packaging
This type of packaging is used to give a product an exclusive image. Limited edition 
perfumes use unique bottles and they are especially popular as gifts. Speciality 
packaging can be successfully used to stimulate demand for a product.
(c)  Individual packaging 
In the case of individual packaging, each product gets its own special pack. This helps 
to give the product an air of exclusivity. For example, a wine maker may choose a sepa-
rate bottle and label design for each of his or her wine products. 
(d)  Reusable packaging 
In the case of reusable packaging, the packaging is deliberately designed to be used 
for another purpose once the contents have been used up. For example, ice cream 
manufacturers may package its ice cream in reusable plastic containers with lids that 
can be sealed.
(e)  Multiple packaging 
In the case of multiple packaging, several similar product items are packaged together. 
For example, a retail egg supplier may package six eggs in a carton. Multiple packaging 
can also help the small business person to introduce a new product or it can be used to 
give customers a special deal if they buy in quantity. 
(f)  Kaleidoscopic packaging 
This type of packaging is done when certain elements in the packaging are changed 
regularly (for example Rugby World Cup players on soft drink tins). The intention is to 
create a demand for the product by creating a demand for the packaging. 
6.8	 WARRANTIES
Generally speaking a warranty offers peace of mind to the customer. It is the customer’s 
promise that if he or she buys the product, it will meet the need that he or she is trying 
to satisfy. If this promise is then not met, the customer can use the ‘warranty’ to either 
replace the product or get his or her money back. A warranty can be written or verbal, 
or may be implied. 
When will you use a written warranty? Some businesspeople think a written warranty 
is not always needed and that it may confuse customers or make them suspicious that 

126
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
the product is not as good as it seems! However, warranties are important for certain 
types of products:
•	 For innovative products a warranty will reduce the risk of using a totally new prod-
uct. 
•	 For a relatively expensive product a warranty will reduce the economic risk of the 
product not performing. 
•	 For a product that is complex to repair, a warranty will serve to assure the customer 
that he or she will not be left with a product that cannot be fixed. 
•	 For a product positioned as being of high quality a warranty will serve to underline 
the impression of quality, the warranty being part of the total product that the 
customer buys. 
In deciding whether or not to have a warranty, or what the extent of the warranty 
should be, the small businessperson needs to consider the following factors:
•	 the costs of offering the warranty 
•	 the actual ability to provide the service that is guaranteed 
•	 the competitors’ warranties 
•	 the expectations of the target market. 
Care needs to be taken because when warranties are expressly stated there are legal 
implications. A warranty is a promise that a product will do certain things or meet 
certain standards. 
6.9	 CASE STUDY: CLOVER DANAO – A NEW APPROACH
Since Clover Danao’s launch in September 2004 into the diverse South African con-
sumer market, Danao has experience strong return on investment in terms of volumes, 
achieving sales of over 700 tons in the best months. 
However, after extensive research of Clover Danone, the concept had shown its limita-
tions. Therefore a new strategy and marketing mix was developed for Danao. It consists 
of the following:
•	 Product: Danao fruit juice and yoghurt blend in three flavours: orange, pineapple/
peach and apricot/tropical fruit.
•	 Packaging layout: A carton pack on which the newest Spanish layout had been 
adapted to suit the pack, featuring strong use of the ‘smiling rising sun’ to 
communicate health and happiness, and to emphasise the morning as the ideal time 
of consumption.

Chapter 6: Product decisions: deciding what to offer to customers 
127
•	 Target market: The whole family, but the core market would be women and mothers 
aged between 25–49 years, Living Standards Measure (LSM) 7–10.
Clover Danao therefore decide to follow a new approach. Various companies and brands  
have had huge success internationally with dairy fruit mix products whose position is 
based on the inherent goodness (functionality) of milk (dairy) and juice. The opportu-
nity therefore existed to relaunch a ‘new’ diary fruit mix that would utilise the above-
mentioned positioning, using the strength of the Clover mother brand which would 
lend the product credibility and a sense of natural goodness and quality. 
6.9.1	 Selecting the target market 
The Danao brand was ideal for the abovementioned segment as it was already posi-
tioned as a healthy product. This new product would appeal to a new segment of the 
market to create new usage occasions and moments of consumption. Therefore, Da-
nao’s new marketing mix and target markets consist of the following:
•	 Demographics: LSM 7–10, aged 25–34, skewed towards urban black families with 
children.
•	 Consumer profile specifics: Health-conscious adults, family orientated, mums.
•	 Unique selling point: The goodness of dairy and fruit juice in one product. 
•	 Brand name: Clover Danao Smooth: ‘Double the Happiness’.
•	 Product description: A new blend of fruit juice and dairy (with yoghurt power) 
fortified with vitamins to match the current product.
•	 Product performance: Healthy, natural flavours and colours. 
•	 Comparable products: Jog-juice, Yogi Sip and Tropika.
6.9.2	 Product development 
For the relaunch of Danao Smooth, product developers established that the key compo-
nents of any ‘healthy’ product are the vitamin and/or mineral content, reduced sugar, 
and natural ingredients. The new dairy fruit mix could be consumed at any time of 
the day to fill that hungry spot and provide an energy boost from a healthy natural  
product. Hence it was proposed to relaunch the Danao dairy fruit mix combining the 
inherent goodness of juice and milk (dairy). The reason Clover had to change the yo-
ghurt content to milk was simply because of the agreement that it had with Danone, not 
to produce fermented/yoghurt products. 

128
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
Clover Danao Smooth would therefore contain real fruit juice and dairy and would 
satisfy the following needs:
•	 nutritional 
•	 appeal to the whole family
•	 value for money
•	 ideal to be consumed with meals
•	 pleasant fruity and tart taste 
•	 smooth texture.
6.9.3	 Branding and packaging 
Management understands that the key to a successful product is developing a strong, 
visible brand name and appropriate packaging. Therefore, Clover did extensive 
research before changing the packaging and ingredients of the Danao product. In terms 
of consumer research, the new bottle design received a menu score of 9.12 out of 10. 
Consumers liked the happy smiling fruit faces that appealed to kids and adults; they 
also liked the juice and dairy-pour shot and the real fruit pictures. The new formulation 
was preferred among consumers in terms of three out of the five flavours and there was 
a no significant indication that the old formulation was preferred. 
The new Danao Smooth was launched in September 2012 and the new packaging and 
formulation, ingredients and processes (using existing machines) meant that Danao 
would be even more profitable. 
Answer the following questions:
1.	 What was the basic need that Clover Danao Smooth product met for its target customers? 
2.	 What factors affected the choice of packaging for Clover Danao Smooth? 
3.	 Suggest a possible promotional strategy that Clover Danao Smooth can employ at Pick 
n Pay retail outlets.
6.10 SUMMARY 
It is important to have a thorough understanding and be able to apply the elements that 
encompass product decisions as it will ensure that an organisation’s offerings will meet 
the needs and wants of the market. This chapter focused on defining what a product 
is, the product mix and how to select the right combination as well as the different 
product strategies. Branding, a key product decision, was then discussed followed by 
the function of product packaging and design. Finally, the importance and implications 
of warranties was explained.

Price decisions 
7
Chapter
7.1 LEARNING OUTCOMES 
After you have studied this chapter, you should be able to:  
• defi ne what is meant by price 
• identify the factors affecting price 
• explain the objectives of pricing 
• describe the three basic pricing strategies 
• discuss the various pricing adjustments.  
7.2 INTRODUCTION
What to charge for a product or service is not as easy as it seems. Many factors impact 
on the decision of to what to charge and one element can mean the difference between 
success and failure. Many factors such as consumer demand, suppliers, government 
regulations, competitor prices, and so forth will infl uence the fi nal price of a product or 
service. Pricing affects the chances of long-term success for a small business, because of 
its implications for profi t. The signifi cance of pricing lies in the fact that price is the only 
element in the marketing mix that brings in revenue, while the other three elements 
(product, promotion, distribution) are costs. 
In a simple way, price can be defi ned as that which the consumer is prepared to pay for a 
product or service. This amount is in direct relation to the perceived value that the product 
or service has for the customer.    
The price of a product plays two major roles in marketing for a small businessperson.
• It infl uences how much of a product customers purchase.
• It infl uences whether selling the product will be profi table.
D

132
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
As mentioned in the definition on the previous page, price is usually stated in monetary 
terms.
However, many small businesses often exchange goods or services with each other. 
This is called bartering. In this situation, the small business entrepreneur offers to pay 
for a product or service with some of his or her own products or services instead of 
money. For example, a small building contractor may get his or her bookkeeper to do 
his or her books in exchange for some improvements to the bookkeeper’s home.
Bartering is the exchange of goods or services for other goods or services. 
    
Table 7.1 lists the many different forms of price.

7.3	 FACTORS AFFECTING PRICE
As stated earlier it is not easy to determine the price of a product or service due to 
the number of factors influencing it. The primary task of a price is to cover costs and 
thereafter to make a contribution to profit. Let us look at the factors that influence price: 
•	 costs, which include the cost of the goods purchased as well as overheads 
D

Chapter 7: Price decisions
133
•	 prices charged by competitors 
•	 type of product or service 
•	 image that you want to attach to the product or business 
•	 supply and demand 
•	 profit expectations 
•	 environmental factors. 
7.3.1	 Costs
The cost of raw materials is often beyond your control, yet it is a factor that affects all 
businesses. If your costs are increasing you have several options:
•	 pass increases on to customers 
•	 pass some of the increases on and absorb others 
•	 stop selling the product. 
For example, when the petrol price goes up, transport costs go up which are then 
usually passed on to the consumers. 
What happens when costs decline? Here you have two choices:
•	 reduce your selling price and keep profits the same 
•	 keep your price the same and make higher profits. 
For example, when sugar prices drop, a chocolate maker can choose to increase the size 
of his or her chocolates and earn the same profit, or leave the price as is and earn more 
profit. 
7.3.2	 Competition 
In order to survive, the prices of competitors need to be taken into consideration. If 
your prices are too high, you may price yourself out of the market. If your prices are too 
low, your product may be regarded with suspicion. 
The actions of competitors also have a great influence on the price you set. You need 
to consider the reactions of competitors to your pricing decisions. This is not an easy 
exercise but you must monitor both your competitors’ price levels and their reactions to 
your pricing moves. For example, a competitor might respond to your actions by either 
cutting prices (price competition) or launching a new product (non-price competition). 

134
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
You can also use competitors’ prices as a guide to where you can set your prices. 
How can you collect information on your competitors’ prices? There are a number of 
possible methods (Cant et al, 2006:337) that can be used:
•	 the sales force can obtain the information during visits 
•	 checks in stores where your products are stocked 
•	 customer surveys 
•	 marketing research, such as focus group discussions 
•	 buying competitors’ products and estimating what their costs are 
•	 calling competitors directly and asking for prices (like any customer can do). 
However you decide to do it, competitive price checks must become a periodic aspect 
of your research activities. 
7.3.3	 The type of product or service 
Price changes affect the sales of some products more than others. For example, if you 
open a bakery and the price of butter rises, it will probably affect your cake sales. If the 
price drops, the chances are that your cake sales will increase. If you have a grocery 
store, however, and the price of milk rises or drops, it will probably not have much 
effect on the amount of milk that you sell. To try to find out whether a price rise or fall 
will affect the sales of your product or service, answer the following questions:
•	 What volumes are purchased by customers? 
•	 What are the reasons that they buy? 
•	 Is the product or service a luxury or a necessity? 
The customer profile can help you to get some of these answers. 
7.3.4	 Image 
The image you decide on for your business is, to a large extent, affected by your price 
levels. If you want to have the image of a low-cost supplier, you will price low, keep 
expenses at a minimum and have a low-cost location. On the other hand, if you want to 
project an image of quality, you will price high, have good service support and a ‘good’ 
location. 

Chapter 7: Price decisions
135
7.3.5	 Supply and demand 
Two of the most important factors affecting your price are supply and demand (Cant, 
2007:26). 
Supply is the amount of a product or service that businesses provide at a given time and a 
given price. 
Demand is the amount of a product or service customers are willing and able to buy at a 
given time at a given price.   
When the demand for a product increases, the price of that product usually goes up. 
For example, let us assume you open up an exclusive clothing boutique which stocks 
locally-produced leather handbags. When the handbags become fashionable interna-
tionally, the demand for them rises, and so your price for them will also probably rise 
because the supply is fairly limited. 
A change in supply also affects price, however when the supply of leather handbags 
from suppliers and producers increases, the price of handbags drops. 
Always consider the effects of supply and demand on new products. 
7.3.6	 Profit expectations 
The profit the small business expects to make will have an impact on the final price of a 
product. If the small businessperson wants to make at least 80% markup, this will affect 
the price as well as the demand for the product. The other factors mentioned previously 
will obviously play a role in the final price, but it may be that the small businessperson 
is the only supplier of the product, in which case he or she can charge a higher price. 
7.3.7	 Environmental factors
These factors generally refer to factors outside the control of the businessperson.
Weather conditions may lead for example to a decline in demand for swimwear, flip 
flops and light clothes if the winter is cold, resulting in prices having to be adjusted 
to generate sales. Similarly a drought may lead to a farmer increasing prices as the 
demand for his product will outstrip the supply.
Other examples are government legislation, taxes and exchange rates. A good example 
of environmental factors can be seen in the changes to VAT that have taken place over 
time. It is important for a small business entrepreneur to be aware of these factors 
and their possible effects. This awareness can be achieved through contacts with your 
bankers, by reading business magazines and newspapers and by asking your customers 
and suppliers.

7.4	 OBJECTIVES OF PRICING
The aim or ultimate objective of pricing is to ensure that the small business generates 
the sales needed to achieve its overall aims. This requires you to identify three broad 
areas related to objectives:
•	 increasing or maximising profits
•	 increasing market share
•	 increasing sales volume.
In trying to increase or maximise profits, the focus is on trying to make the most 
profit possible in the long term. This may be achieved by trying to obtain an average 
percentage of profit or trying to make the most profit you can on each sale. For example, 
a business may try to average 20% profit on every rand sold. 
Some businesses focus on maintaining or increasing their market share. This means get-
ting a bigger percentage of the business than your competitors. The idea is to strength-
en your position relative to that of the competitors (getting a bigger slice of the pie).  
For example, the objective might be to increase your share of the market from 30% to 
40%. 
Other businesses set their prices so as to maintain or increase the sales volume that they 
have achieved. The idea here is to increase the overall sales figure. 
In many instances a new start-up business will focus on survival over the initial period. 
Once the business is established the other types of objectives can become more viable. 
Survival is, in fact, the basic objective of any business. 
There are seven major types of objectives when it comes to pricing Cant (2007:25).
7.4.1	 Survival 
Some organisations focus on survival as one of their objectives simply because they  
want to stay in the game. These organisations will try to increase their sales by 
adjusting the price levels of their products in order to remain commensurate with the 
organisations’ expenses. An example would be an organisation pricing below cost just 
to cover all expenses (fixed and variable) in order to stay in the market. 

Chapter 7: Price decisions
137
7.4.2	 Profit 
In trying to increase or maximise profits the focus is on trying to make the most profit 
possible in the long term. This might be achieved by trying to obtain an average per-
centage of profit or trying to make the most profit you can on each sale. For example, a 
business may try to average 25% profit on every rand sold. Some organisations aim for 
satisfactory profits or return on investment (ROI). 
7.4.3	 Sales and market share 
Some businesses set their prices so as to maintain or increase the sales volume that  
they have achieved. The idea here is to increase the overall sales figure. An example 
of this objective would be to increase sales from R700 000 per annum to R950 000 per 
annum. Be careful, though. You can easily increase sales by decreasing your price, but 
you may not make any money doing so. Some businesses also focus on maintaining or 
increasing their market share. This means getting a bigger percentage of the business 
than your competitors. The idea is to strengthen your position relative to that of the 
competitors (getting a bigger slice of the pie). For example, the objective might be to 
increase your share of the market from 30% to 40%. 
7.4.4	 Competition 
The objective here is to meet and keep in line with competitors’ pricing. This emphasis-
es the importance of understanding your competitors, what they offering and at what 
prices. Organisations also need to focus on differentiation to attain a better competitive 
advantage and achieve success. For example, if Samsung decides on a price increase, 
an objective for LG would be to follow that increase in order to stay in line with its 
competitor (Samsung). 
7.4.5	 Product-quality leadership 
It would be a profitable objective for organisations to implement themselves as 
product-quality leaders. If customers perceive an organisation as having higher quality 
products, then this gives an organisation the advantage of charging higher prices for 
their products or services. An example would be Lexus: most people believe Mercedes 
is a high quality brand and that is why the company are able to price high. 
7.4.6	 Social responsibility 
The aim here is to price products to the advantage of the community by making 
prices more affordable to them. It includes products that are a major need to society 
for example the anti-retroviral drug to treat HIV. Many will not be able to afford this 
medication and that is why the firm who supplied this drug offered it to the South 
African government for free for a period of 5 years.

7.4.7	 Non-profit and other public organisations 
The objective of these organisations is simply not to make a profit, but rather to enhance 
and increase the value of the organisation. They rely on gifts, donations and financial 
support of others to cover their costs. 
Step 2 in setting prices: decide what you are aiming to achieve 
7.5	 DECIDING ON YOUR BASIC PRICE LEVEL
Once you have analysed the factors affecting price and established what you want to 
achieve through pricing, you need to set the basic price level for your product or service. 
In order to set a basic price, you need to consider three areas (Blythe, 2014:458):
•	 cost-oriented pricing 
•	 customer-oriented pricing 
•	 pricing relative to competition. 
7.5.1	 Cost-oriented pricing
Many small businesses determine their basic price according to their costs. The idea is 
to set your price high enough to cover your costs and still make a profit. Before we look 
at using costs as a basis for prices, we need to understand certain types of costs (Cant 
et al, 2013:340).
Table 7.2:  Fixed costs vs variable costs
Fixed costs 
Variable costs
equipment costs
cost of materials
rentals
cost of components
Fixed costs are those costs that stay the same no matter how many products are pro-
duced. Examples of these are salaries and wages, equipment costs or rental. All of these 
are incurred and stay the same whether the business is going full steam ahead or not 
making anything.
Variable costs are those costs that increase proportionately with the amount of products 
produced. Examples of these are costs of materials and components. The more products 
you make, the more raw materials are used up.

Chapter 7: Price decisions
139
Let us look at three of the cost-oriented methods for setting a basic price:
•	 cost–plus pricing
•	 rate of return pricing
•	 break-even analysis.
Cost–plus pricing
Many small businesspeople use this method. Here you determine the cost of the product 
and then add a set percentage to the cost for the profit margin. This method is popular 
and easy to use. 
Assume you are a manufacturer of garden shade nets. After some financial analysis, you 
find the following:
Variable cost 	
	
R60
Fixed cost 	
	
R15 000
Expected sales 	
	
5 000 shades
The unit cost for each shade is: unit cost = variable cost + current sales 
= R60 + 15 000
5 000   
= R63 
Assume you want a profit margin of 40% (also called the markup): 
 Cost–plus price =  
unit cost
(1 – profit margin)  
= 
63
1 – 40/100 = 
63
1 – 0.4 = 63
0.6  = 105
You will charge customers R105 for each shade and make a profit of R42 per unit 
(R105 – R63 = R42). 
Using the cost–plus method, and using the information in the example above, calculate 
what the price will have to be to make a: 
(i) 	 50% markup 
(ii)  	60% markup 
(Answers: (i) R126; (ii) R157,50) 
eg
Do

Rate of return pricing 
This method is similar to the previous one but brings another aspect into the calculation: 
namely the cost of investing your money in the business. The idea is to set a price that 
gives you a certain rate of return on your total investment. This differs from the cost–
plus method, which gives you a certain profit margin per item sold. 
To use this method you need four figures:
•	 an estimate of the units you will sell 
•	  what each unit costs: variable costs + 
fixed cost
estimated unit sales  
•	 the total amount of money invested in making and selling the product 
•	 the target rate of return you want on your money. 
Assume you invested R30 000 to produce and sell garden umbrellas. You want to make 
30% return on your money and you think you will be able to sell 5 000 garden umbrellas. 
The variable cost is R60 per unit and the fixed costs are R15 000. The price you will set to 
achieve this rate of return is: 
target return price = unit cost + (target rate of return × total money invested ÷ estimated sales) 
60 × 15 000
5 000
 + (0,30 × 30 000)
5 000
 
= 63 + (0,30 x 6) 
= 63 + 1,80 
= R64,80 
Using the information supplied in the example above, calculate what the price will have to 
be if you want a:
(i)  	35% rate of return 
(ii)  	40% rate of return 
(Answers: (i) R65,10; (ii) R65,40)  
Break-even analysis 
Break-even analysis is useful because it shows you how many units you will have to 
sell in order to cover your costs at a certain price. At the break-even point, the money 
brought in (price × unit sales) exactly equals the total costs to make that many units. 
eg
Do

Chapter 7: Price decisions
141
(Also see Chapter 15 for more information on break-even calculations.)
Anything sold over that amount at that price means that the business makes money. 
Any sales in units less than that amount at that price mean that your business is losing 
money! 
Assume you make and market garden umbrellas. You want to price your garden umbrella at 
R70. Fixed costs are R15 000. Variable costs are R60 per unit. 
Break-even point in units = 
total fixed costs
selling price – variable cost per unit  
= R15 000
R70 – R60  
= 1 500 units 
If your business sells 1 500 units at R70 each, it will cover all its costs. If it sells more than 
1 500 units at R70 each, it will make a profit of R10 a unit.
Using the information supplied in the example above, calculate the break-even point for a 
price of: 
(i) 	 R80 
(ii)  	R65 
(Answers: (i) 750 units; (ii) 3 000 units)   
All of the cost-oriented approaches to determining your product’s basic price have one 
common flaw – they do not take into account that the price can affect the number of 
products that customers want. 
7.5.2	 Customer-oriented pricing
In this approach, pricing is not simply an issue of calculating a formula, but rather set-
ting a price that is perceived by customers to be of value relative to what they get for 
the price. 
Methods for customer-oriented pricing include (Strydom, 2004:174):
•	 backward pricing 
•	 prestige pricing 
•	 odd-number pricing 
•	 price lines 
eg
Do

142
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
•	 skimming pricing
•	 penetration pricing
•	 bundle pricing. 
Backward pricing 
With this method you estimate the price that customers will be willing to pay for a 
product. You can find this out through market research, using surveys or focus groups. 
This process will also help you to determine what the cost of making the product and 
the cost of components should be, in order for you to be able to give the customers the 
product at the price they expect. Once you have this estimate, you work backwards to 
see at what price you will sell to your distributors, so that the price plus the distributors’ 
margin equals the price customers expect to pay. 
Prestige pricing 
A business that follows this method uses price to try to show the quality or prestige of 
its product or service. You set a high price, assuming that customers think a high price 
means high quality. This method is often used when your target market is the high-
income/high-status type of customer. For example, you may start a carpet cleaning 
business and price yourself high because your target market is the upper-income 
neighbourhood in your town. 
Odd-number pricing 
This refers to the method of using prices ending in odd numbers or less than a round figure 
(for example, R3,99 instead of R4,00). Why would you do this? Two possible reasons are:
•	 Customers may think that R3,99 is much lower than R4,00 because it seems closer 
to R3,00 than R4,00. 
•	 Many small retail businesses use odd-number pricing to force sales people to ring 
up the sale on the cash register and give customers change. 
Price lines 
This method involves the use of only a few prices for each of your product lines. For 
example, you may use the price to indicate the levels of quality within your product 
line (for example economy line, value line, high-quality line). One advantage of this 
approach is that your customer may have more choice. For example, you may open 
a store selling paint and stock three lines: an economy paint priced at R39,99 for six  
litres, a medium-priced line at R59,99 for six litres and a high-quality/high-priced paint 
line at R79,99 for six litres. 
Sometimes you may decide to price a line at a level that just covers costs in order to 
help the sales of other more profitable lines. Such a line is called a loss leader. The idea 
is to attract customers to the business with the loss leader, as they are likely to buy 

Chapter 7: Price decisions
143
more expensive items as well. For example, a hardware store may price its white PVA 
paint low as a loss leader, hoping at the same time to get sales of its regular-priced 
paintbrushes, enamel paints and painting accessories. 
Skimming pricing 
When introducing a new product to a market, there are two different pricing options:
•	 the skimming approach 
•	 the penetration approach. 
When you follow the skimming approach, you price your product or service fairly 
high. The aim of the skimming approach is to maximise profits. You will follow this 
approach if:
•	 you do not have too many potential competitors 
•	 customers do not know much about the product 
•	 you do not need to recover your investment quickly. 
Penetration pricing 
A penetration pricing approach means that you price your product relatively low. The 
aim of penetration pricing is to penetrate or break into new markets, in other words, to 
gain market share. You will follow this approach if:
•	 you have many potential competitors 
•	 customers do not easily accept high prices. 
Most of the time, the actual price chosen is between the two levels (the high level of 
skimming pricing and the low level of penetration pricing). Lamb, Hair, McDaniel, 
Boshoff and Terblanche (2011:403) state that bundle pricing is also an important method 
to consider. 
Bundle pricing
In this approach you combine two or more products or services in a single price. For 
example, if you own a bottle store you might sell a bottle of red wine and a bottle of 
white wine at a set price for both. You might also sell a bottle of red wine with a wine 
glass and a copy of a wine guide for a set price. The idea is to provide the customer 
with a higher-value product at a better price than if he or she were to buy each of the 
items individually. Many businesses introduce new products through bundle pricing, 
and also use bundle pricing for special occasions such as Easter. For example, you may 
be a chocolate manufacturer and offer a carton of six chocolate eggs, a large chocolate 
Easter bunny and a woven basket for a better price than if a customer were to buy each 
item individually.

7.5.3	 Pricing relative to competition 
We have looked at using costs to determine your basic price. We have also looked at 
customer-oriented pricing. 
Levels of pricing
Another approach to setting your basic price level is to establish the level compared 
with competing products and services. There are three options here: 
(i)	 Pricing above the market. Pricing above the market means pricing your product 
or service higher than similar products or services sold by competitors. You need 
to justify the higher price in the customer’s mind through better quality, up-market 
image or better location. 
(ii)	 Pricing below the market. Pricing below the market means pricing below similar 
products or services offered by competitors in order to make up for the lower profit 
through higher sales volume. The idea is to sell more than your competitors do. 
(iii)	Pricing at the market. Pricing at the market means pricing to match your 
competitors’ prices. You will take this approach if you do not have a substantial 
competitive edge enabling you to price higher than competitors. 
A further approach to setting your basic price level is to establish the level compared 
with competing products and services. There are five basic methods that can be used 
(Cant et al, 2006:349): 
(i)	 Follow the leader pricing. A company using this approach will follow any price 
changes made by the leaders within the industry. 
(ii)	 Adaptive pricing. This approach involves small companies that will react to price 
changes made by competitors who obtain a larger share of the market. 
(iii)	Opportunistic pricing. The aim of this method is to price lower than the competitors 
or to avoid following price increases made by the competitors in order to attract 
and draw in customers. 
(iv)	Predatory pricing. This approach involves setting extremely low prices in order to 
damage or hurt the organisation’s competitors. 
(v)	 Competitive bidding. This is a process whereby the buyer will ask the seller to 
indicate a price at which a certain product should be sold. 

Chapter 7: Price decisions
145
Yet another approach for setting your basic price level is to establish the level compared 
with competing products and services. There are six basic methods that can be used 
(Cant, 2013:84): 
(i)	 Going rate pricing (same level as the competitor). If companies decide to use 
going rate pricing, they price products that match the competitors’ prices. You will 
take this approach if you do not have a substantial competitive edge enabling you 
to price higher than competitors. 
(ii)	 Above-market pricing. Pricing above the market means pricing your product or 
service higher than similar products or services sold by competitors. You need to 
justify the higher price in the customer’s mind through better quality, up-market 
image or better location. 
(iii)	Below-market pricing. Pricing below the market means pricing below similar 
products or services offered by competitors in order to make up for the lower profit 
through higher sales volume. The idea is to sell more than your competitors do. 
(iv)	Customary pricing. When using customary pricing, the prices of products or 
services must be based on tradition. This will result in all competitors’ pricing 
being the same. An example would be products in a vending machine. 
(v)	 Loss-leader pricing. The aim of this method is to attract customers by pricing 
products lower than the competitor or even below cost. 
(vi)	Sealed-bid pricing. This is when companies price products based on how they 
believe their competitors will price. 
The trick with the basic price level is to price the product or service at the level at which it 
will sell, not at the level at which you want it to sell.

KFC – Finger Lickin’ Good
KFC is seen to be affordable. However in comparison to other fast food retailers of chicken 
such as Chicken Licken and Hungry Lion, KFC is often at a premium. In fact, KFC has always 
taken a hard line by never discounting or positioning on price, which is a tough stance to 
take in a category filled with price fighters.
In fact, many of KFC’s competitors are all-out fighters and seasoned discounters. Think 
of Roman Pizza’s blatant discount positioning, McDonald’s small change campaigns and 
Steers 2 for 1 Wacky Wednesday specials.
Yet, KFC consumers are not concerned about price as confirmed by a TNS price elasticity 
study. In a survey of 1698 respondents, the KFC brand has the lowest absolute price 
elasticity of any brand for which TNS Research Surveys had calculated price elasticity in 
South Africa. This demonstrates that consumers are loyal to KFC despite pricing.
Any competitor thinking of competing against KFC will have to consider the above 
achievements carefully.  
1.	 How does KFC price itself relative to the competition? 
2.	 What factors have affected the pricing followed by KFC? 
3.	 What pricing objective do you think KFC has adopted?  
7.6	 SUMMARY 
Being able to determine the value of a product or service can be considered as the fine 
line between an organisation’s success or failure and therefore, this chapter looked 
at factors that will affect the price that is charged for an organisation’s products and 
services. Grasping the elements and objectives of pricing as well as being able to apply 
the three basic price strategies is essential in determining long-term success. Finally, 
price adjustments and the process of evaluating credit concluded the chapter.

Distribution: getting the 
product to the customer 
8
Chapter
8.1 LEARNING OUTCOMES 
After you have studied this chapter, you should be able to:  
• defi ne what is meant by distribution 
• identify the choices of distribution intensity 
• distinguish between different types of middlemen 
• describe the different types of distribution channels.  
8.2 INTRODUCTION 
What product do you think has made it the easiest for its customers to get the product 
when and where they want to get it? Some of you may think of a sweet product (like a 
Kit Kat), or even a beverage product (such as a Coca-Cola). One product that you may 
not have thought of is airtime – the cellular services providers have done a fantastic job 
of making that product available almost anywhere, from almost any outlet, whether in 
the city, in a rural area, from a retailer, or even from a hawker! The decisions made to get 
the product available to the customers are called distribution decisions. 
Distribution focuses on the process to get the product to the customer. It is not only 
about the physical outlet where customers can buy the product but, also the process 
of getting it to the outlet or to the customer. Furthermore it focuses on the process to 
keep these outlets supplied with stock in order to prevent out-of-stock situations. The 
fact is that at some point the small business will need a distribution strategy to ensure 
that its products arrive safely at the right place at the right time, thus helping to ensure 
maximum customer satisfaction. 

150
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
Distribution can be defi ned as the establishment of a system that gets your product to 
where the customer wants to buy it. In order to do this, a decision has to be taken on the 
distribution channel to be used. 
The system that is used to get products and services from the producer to the fi nal consumer 
is defi ned as a distribution channel (Cant & Van Heerden, 2013:403). This system consists 
of people and organisations.   
A simple way of looking at a distribution channel is as a pipeline through which 
products fl ow from the producer to the customer. Within this pipeline are businesses 
that help in getting the product to the fi nal customer, examples of such businesses are 
wholesalers and retailers. These businesses are termed middlemen or intermediaries. 
A middleman or intermediary is a business that helps move the product or service from the 
producer to the customer through the distribution channel.   
For example, a farmer sells his maize to the cooperative, which processes it and sells it 
to wholesalers who, in turn, package it into smaller packages and sell them to retailers 
who then sell them to the end-user. Customers will be able to purchase the maize in 
small quantities at various shops. The maize wholesaler (eg Ruto Mills) and the retail-
ers (eg Pick n Pay) can then be termed middlemen or intermediaries in the distribution 
channel of the maize producer to the consumer. 
Although we tend to always think about the distribution channel going from producer 
to fi nal consumer, it can also work the other way – from fi nal consumer to producer. This 
is called a reverse distribution channel (Cant & Van Heerden, 2013:403). An example of 
this type of distribution channel is when empty Coca-Cola bottles are returned – the 
empty bottles eventually end up at the bottler for Coca-Cola for reuse or for recycling.

8.3	 CHOOSING THE INTENSITY OF DISTRIBUTION
The intensity of distribution is a very important decision for the small business and 
it revolves around the decision to decide how many outlets will carry or stock the 
product. This is called the intensity of distribution. This intensity will depend on: 
•	 where the marketer is (location) 
•	 the characteristics of the product 
•	 the behaviour of the final consumers, and what they expect.
There are three options for the intensity of distribution: 
8.3.1	 Intensive distribution 
With intensive distribution, you try to make your product available at all possible 
outlets. This means you will use all possible middlemen. Branding is important here 
because you need to ensure that the stock moves well. Examples of products that follow 
this route are milk, cigarettes and newspapers. 
8.3.2	 Selective distribution 
With selective distribution, you select fewer outlets than you would with intensive dis-
tribution but take care in choosing which to use. Shopping products, such as furniture 
and clothes, are examples of products which are suited to this type of intensity. 
8.3.3	 Exclusive distribution 
With exclusive distribution, you purposely limit the number of people who carry your 
product. Examples of this are jewellery products. Franchises also use exclusive distri-
bution. For example, a chocolate manufacturer may decide to supply only sweet shops 
in upmarket shopping centres in big cities. 
The choice of the intensity of distribution depends on the following product 
characteristics: 
Price of the product 
The more expensive the product, the more exclusive or selective (limited) the intensity. 
The lower the price, the greater the tendency for intensive distribution. Milk and 
newspapers can be bought on just about every street corner, while Rolex watches are 
found in one or two outlets in a town. 

152
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
Technical complexity 
The more complex the product, the more selective or exclusive the intensity should 
be. This is especially so if your product requires specialist training or knowledge. 
Think about aeroplanes and mining vehicles that are complex machinery and need 
demonstrations on how to operate them. 
Selling requirements 
If advice or sales assistance will be needed, you should tend towards selective or 
exclusive distribution. If the product is suitable for self-service outlets, consider 
intensive distribution. Complicated statistical packages or other software normally 
need to be demonstrated and therefore will use exclusive or selective distribution. 
Service requirements 
If there is a need for installing, maintaining or repairing the product, you should tend 
towards selective/exclusive distribution. (Source: Cant & Van Heerden, 2013:418)
Coca-Cola – Coke is an example of one of the products with very intense distribution. Think 
of the number of places in a normal day where you could purchase a Coke. You could buy 
one at the petrol station on the way to work. You could buy one at the street corner from 
a sidewalk vendor while waiting for the traffic light to change. You could buy one from 
a vending machine in the foyer of your workplace. You could buy one from a café or a 
restaurant at lunch. As you may notice, Coke is available almost anywhere.
Nike sport shoes – This is an example of a shopping product. The brand is available at most 
reputable sports shops, at most clothing stores and at many independent clothing retailers. 
It is also available at many of the markets frequented by street vendors – but you need to 
be careful that they are genuine and not counterfeit ones!
David Tlale designer dresses – David is a well-known South African fashion designer and 
his designs are available at only a few exclusive boutiques or at his own premises. This is an 
example of exclusive distribution.
Step 1 in distribution: decide on intensity 
8.4	 TYPES OF INTERMEDIARIES 
It is important that the small businessperson is aware of the different types of 
intermediaries that exist. There are three different types that can be identified:
•	 sales intermediaries 
•	 wholesalers 
•	 retailers. 
eg

Chapter 8: Distribution: getting the product to the customer 
153
What are the differences between them? Wholesalers and retailers are called resellers. 
A reseller is an intermediary who actually owns the products he or she handles. 
A sales intermediary brings producers and retailers into contact with one another, but does 
not actually own the product being handled. A sales intermediary’s job is to be the link 
between the different people in the distribution channel.   
8.4.1	 Sales intermediaries
The two most common kinds of sales intermediaries are brokers and agents. A small 
business that has no salespeople usually uses agents to sell its products to wholesalers 
or retailers. Agents help a small business gain sales and usually charge a commission 
for their services. The agent usually gets a set percentage of the sales value as a fee for 
the service. For example, a manufacturer of women’s dresses may use an agent to visit 
boutiques to sell his or her dresses to them. 
A broker usually just brings buyers and sellers together. The idea is to make negotiations 
possible between buyers and sellers. The person who asked for the service is the one 
who pays the broker. Insurance and real estate are two areas in which brokers are 
common. (Source: Kurtz 2008:470–471)
8.4.2	 Wholesalers
A business that gets most of its sales income from selling to other businesses or 
organisations is termed a wholesaler. Makro, for example, is considered a wholesaler. 
This does not mean that it does not sell to private customers but that selling to resellers 
is the primary part of its business. A business that sells catering and cooking equipment 
and supplies, like cutlery and plates, to the catering and hospitality trade is an example 
of a wholesaler.
There are a number of different kinds of wholesalers:
•	 Cash-and-carry wholesalers: The cash-and-carry wholesaler is a business where a 
shopkeeper gets what he or she wants and pays cash for it. The shopkeeper has to 
transport his or her own goods. 
•	 Rack-jobber: The rack-jobber is an intermediary who manages shelf space in retail 
stores. This kind of wholesaler usually specialises in certain areas (eg painting 
supplies) and ensures that the shelves in the shops are stocked with the product. 
The shopkeeper then gets a set margin on the products that are sold.

•	 Truck-jobbers: The truck-jobber is an intermediary who goes from shop to shop, 
delivering perishable products (products that do not last long), such as vegetables 
and fruit. 
•	 Mail order wholesalers: The mail order wholesaler uses catalogues to inform 
customers of what is available and then sends out products that are ordered, usually 
on a cash-on-delivery (COD) basis. (Source: Kurtz, 2008:469–470)
8.4.3	 Retailers
A business that sells to the general public for private or home use is termed a retailer. 
There are many kinds of retailers:
•	 General dealers: General dealers have a very wide variety of products and are often 
found in rural areas. 
•	 Department stores: Department stores are large establishments that have a fairly 
wide range of products in different departments, such as clothing, haberdashery, 
cosmetics, crockery and so on. Examples are Stuttafords and Edgars. 
•	 Speciality stores: Speciality stores have only a few product lines but a great deal of 
variety in those lines. An example of these stores is a jewellery store. 
•	 Chain stores: Chain stores are similar stores in various places that are controlled by 
one business. Examples of chain stores are Shoprite/Checkers and Pick n Pay. 
•	 Supermarkets: Supermarkets are self-service stores offering a fairly wide variety of 
grocery and household products. Spar stores are a good example of supermarkets. 
•	 Hypermarkets: Hypermarkets are large stores with a wide product range, low 
prices, sizable parking and a fairly large target market. An example is the Pick n Pay 
Hypermarkets around the country. 
•	 Spaza shops: Spaza shops are small shops in townships and informal areas that 
stock limited quantities of staples. 
•	 Internet retailers: One of the newer developments in retailing is the explosion in re-
tailers that are found on the internet. These vary from retailers specialising in certain 
products like kitchen products (eg Yuppiechef) to those that offer a very broad range 
of products (such as Kalahari.com or Amazon). (Source: Palmer, 2009:354–355)
Step 2 in distribution: decide on the types of intermediaries you will need 
Deciding on the type of middleman the small businessperson wants is one thing, but 
getting them to actually stock the product may not be possible. Take for example a 

Chapter 8: Distribution: getting the product to the customer 
155
new manufacturer of a range of kitchen utensils. The small businessperson might have 
a beautiful range, but the outlets such as @home, Game, Woolworths and so forth 
may not be interested in stocking the product for whatever reason. The outlet that the 
businessperson wants is not always willing to stock the product and thus alternative 
options must be sourced. 
1.	 What sort of intermediary (category) and specific type of intermediary would you need 
for the following situations?
a. 	 You own a real estate business and pay somebody to make negotiations 
possible between buyers and sellers.
b. 	 You own a hardware store and use the services of a paint supplier to keep your 
shelves stocked with painting supplies.
c. 	 You manufacture tracksuits and pay someone a commission to sell your range 
to wholesalers, retailers and the public.
d. 	 You are the owner of the café which also sells fruit and vegetables.
2.	 What three factors will influence your choice of the number of potential outlets that 
should distribute your product or service? 
8.5	 CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION
A distribution channel can be direct or indirect.
When one is talking about a direct channel it means that there is no middleman between 
the producer and the customer.
An indirect channel on the other hand is a distribution channel with one or more middlemen 
between the producer and the final customer.   
A leather manufacturer who sells to customers from his or her factory is using a direct 
channel of distribution. If the manufacturer sells to leather goods stores, which then 
sell to customers, he or she is using an indirect channel. Of course, nothing stops the 
leather manufacturer from using both direct and indirect channels, and this is called 
a multi-channel distribution strategy. This would also apply to a manufacturer using 
retail outlets such as a leather store but also selling though the internet.

Let us look at possible channels for consumer and industrial products. 
8.5.1	 Marketing channels for consumer products 
We have already said that consumer products are for use by individuals or families. 
Examples of this type of product are cakes and household appliances. What channels 
might be used by a small business producing consumer goods? Some of the possible 
options are shown and discussed below.

Producer to customer 
The producer to customer distribution channel is short because there is no middleman. 
The small business can use its own sales force, the internet or mail catalogues. Examples 
of businesses that use such channels are Tupperware and the book and CD clubs that 
sell through the mail. Most service businesses (for example, dry cleaners) use a direct 
channel such as this. 
Producer to retailer to customer 
There is a producer to retailer to customer distribution channel where the small business 
uses a retailer, such as a supermarket or spaza shop, to sell to customers. An example is 
where Nando’s uses retailers such as Shoprite/Checkers to sell its sauces to the public.

Chapter 8: Distribution: getting the product to the customer 
157
Producer to wholesaler to retailer to customer 
This kind of channel is used by many small businesses. For example, a manufacturer 
of paintbrushes might sell to a hardware wholesaler, who then sells to hardware stores 
all over the region. 
Producer to agent to retailer to customer
This kind of distribution channel is commonly used by many small businesses which 
cannot afford their own sales force and which rely on agents to sell for them. For 
example, a clothing manufacturer might hire an agent to sell for him or her to all the 
independent clothing stores.
Producer to agent to wholesaler to retailer to customer
This kind of channel is often used when many small businesses sell to a large number of 
wholesalers around the country. For example, a hair product producer might use agents 
to sell to wholesalers, who then sell to retailers and hair salons.
8.5.2	 Marketing channels for industrial products
Industrial products, which are used in the production of services or other products, 
generally follow four types of distribution channels.

Most industrial products are sold directly to the user. For example, a manufacturer of 
overalls might sell overalls direct to factories.
Producer to agent to industrial user
If a small business is not able to sell its own product it might use an agent to do it. 
Agents are also useful when you are introducing a new product or going into a new 
market because they can use their contacts and experience in the industry to get sales. 

158
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
Producer to industrial distributor to industrial user 
The industrial distributor acts like a wholesaler and usually handles products that are 
not highly priced, such as office equipment, office supplies and operating supplies. 
Industrial distributors usually carry sizable stock so as to be able to deliver promptly 
to customers. 
Producer to agent to industrial distributor to industrial user 
Here the small business entrepreneur who cannot afford his or her own sales force can 
use an agent to reach the important distributors of the product. 
The question of whether or not to use a direct channel requires careful consideration. 
You have to consider many factors and weigh up which channel option will be best for 
your business. A number of the factors to consider are shown below. 
Factors which may direct the business to use a direct distribution channel include: 
•	 a product that needs a demonstration such as a software package for accountants 
•	 a product that needs to be tested under supervision such as a new type of chemical 
in the medical field 
•	 the need to go into long and complicated negotiations 
•	 a product that needs specialised after-sales service 
•	 not being able to convince existing channels to carry stock 
•	 very high middlemen profit margins 
•	 very concentrated industrial markets (with few buyers). 
Factors which may justify a more indirect distribution channel:
•	 lack of financial resources to establish own channels 
•	 a need to use resources elsewhere in a business 
•	 lack of know-how in getting distribution 
•	 not enough of a product mix to operate on your own 
•	 a large number of potential buyers who are, however, widely scattered 
•	 a lack of selling skills or selling knowledge.
Step 3 in distribution: decide which channel or channels you will use for your 
marketing distribution

What type of channel will the following use?

8.6  SUMMARY 
Establishing a distribution strategy is vital for an organisation in order to be able to 
deliver products to geographically dispersed customers so that they can keep their 
outlets supplied with stock in order to prevent out-of-stock situations. This chapter 
has therefore focussed on the distribution strategy by discussing distribution intensity, 
the different types of intermediaries, as well as the channels of distribution. In essence, 
this chapter allowed the reader to understand the basic principles of making strategic 
decisions in order to make the product available to the customer.

Promotion: communicating 
with your market

Chapter
9.1 LEARNING OUTCOMES 
After you have studied this chapter, you should be able to:  
• explain the three main objectives of promotion 
• defi ne the various promotional mix elements 
• identify the factors to consider when selecting a promotional mix 
• discuss the steps in developing a promotion plan.   
9.2 INTRODUCTION 
It is no use having the best product or service and nobody is aware of it. Businesses 
need to make use of promotion to inform their market of the products and services 
they offer. In order to decide on the best combination of the promotional mix element 
it is, however, important that the small business knows who their market is and which 
media would be the best to reach them. 
Promotion for an entrepreneurial business: Robyn Roberts Studio
Robyn Roberts Studio is a business that designs and manufactures fashion outfi ts for special 
occasions and specialises in bridal wear. It operates from a house in Cape Town and this 
location is in a residential neighbourhood and not in a retail area. For this reason, visibility 
and awareness of the business is a challenge because the business relies on referrals.
The business uses its website effectively to generate enquiries. Its Facebook page provides a 
method of keeping in touch with past and future clients, and by posting pictures of brides in their 
designer dresses they can generate awareness in their market. They also generate publicity 
through coverage of some of the weddings of their celebrity clients wearing their custom-
design dresses. They are also active with the press and magazines in terms of the fashion 
editorial sections, and this has helped build awareness and created some leads to follow up. 
The Studio also participates in bridal expos and fashion shows because these activities bring 
them into contact with potential clients and provides access to them in a popular manner.

Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
Promotion can be defi ned as a collection of activities and methods used by the business 
to communicate primarily with its customers but also with all other parties of importance 
including staff (Cant & Van Heerden, 2013).   
When looking at this defi nition, current customers as well as potential future customers 
are included. These groups need to be informed of the company’s products and services, 
as well as be made aware of the brand. Furthermore, employees who are generally in 
direct contact with these customers need to be aware of the products and services, as 
well as any specials that may be on offer. 
From the discussion above we can summarise that there are three generally accepted 
communication objectives for promotion. These are: 
• to inform the target customer or specifi c audiences about your product and services 
to generate awareness
• to persuade the customers or target audiences to take some specifi c action that will 
hopefully lead to sales for you
• to remind customers or target audiences about your products and services or their 
specifi c attributes.
Remember, however, that promotion is only one element in the marketing mix and 
that it is closely integrated with the other three elements. The maximum effect of the 
marketing mix is achieved only if all mix elements work together. This is highlighted in 
Figure 9.1, which shows that the promotion mix works together with the other elements 
of the marketing mix.

The promotional mix consists of a number of methods that can be considered by the 
small business. There are eight main elements of the promotional mix which include 
advertising, sales promotion, publicity, personal selling, public relations, sponsorship, 
direct marketing and e-communication (Cant & Van Heerden, 2013). These elements 
are briefly discussed below:
1.	 Advertising: Advertising is a paid form of non-personal communication about a 
product, service or idea directed at a large target audience. Examples of advertising 
media include radio, television, newspapers, magazines and the internet. A business 
that manufactures and installs blinds could take out an advertisement in a home 
decoration magazine to advertise its services. 
2.	 Sales promotions: Sale promotions are marketing activities designed to act as in-
centives and provide extra value to the customer. Such incentives include coupons, 
free samples, prizes, contests and sweepstakes. A business that produces artisan 
cheeses could rent a stall at a market and give away small samples of its cheeses to 
taste to try to induce sales.
3.	 Publicity: Publicity refers to the public information about a firm. It’s a form of non-
personal communication and is not directly paid for. In this way, organisations can 
achieve free and positive exposure for the organisation. A veterinary hospital could 
provide free care for injured owls and rehabilitate them. At the same time it can get 
coverage by communicating to drivers to be on the look-out for owls at night and 
also get coverage for its work in the press.
4.	 Personal selling: Personal selling involves interpersonal communications between 
the buyer and seller. The aim is to persuade the buyer to make a purchase. It in-
volves direct contact with the customer either face to face or over the phone. A busi-
ness advising companies on how to save on electrical costs will have to visit those 
companies and sell their services to the relevant departments.
5.	 Public relations: Public relations help an organisation to communicate better with 
its customers, stakeholders, employees, suppliers and the community in order to 
build good relationships with them. It is important that organisations create favour-
able attitudes and a positive image of themselves. A nutritionist could for example 
offer free nutrition seminars for schools and women’s groups, and the ensuing im-
provements in relationships with his or her stakeholders can generate value for all.
6.	 Sponsorship: Sponsorship means that the organisation supports an event, 
activity or another organisation either financially or through the provision of the 
organisation’s products and services. A retail business could sponsor a fund-raising 
event to benefit the Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund, or even donate a percentage 
of its profits to the fund.

Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
7.	 Direct marketing: Direct marketing involves communicating directly with the 
customer to encourage a response (such as an order, a visit to a store or website). 
Some of the methods include direct mail, telemarketing, direct-response advertising 
and online computer shopping services. A direct mail campaign by an educational 
toy manufacturer to new mothers emphasising the importance of stimulation in the 
development of their children is an example of this method. 
8.	 E-communication: E-communication involves reaching the consumer by using new 
technology that will enable the organisation to reach the customer with greater im-
pact and increasing frequency. It includes the internet, cellular technology, inter-
active TV, multimedia and touch-screen kiosks. Many businesses utilise tools like 
blogs, Facebook and LinkedIn to supplement its web presence in promoting the 
business. Nomu, a well-known spices and condiments company based in Cape 
Town has a presence in many retail outlets but has a strong blogging and email-
based campaign where recipes using its products are sent to its website subscribers 
(visit them at www.nomu.co.za).
9.3	 FACTORS TO CONSIDER IN DECIDING ON A 
	
PROMOTION MIX 
The promotional mix to be used needs to take a number of factors into consideration. 
Some of the more important ones are listed below (Lamb et al, 2004:332–334): 
9.3.1	 Location of customers 
The location of customers is crucial in the selection of media to be used. The more di-
spersed customers are, the less effective some methods of communication become. If 
customers are widely scattered over a broad geographical area, advertising may be the 
best option. If not, then a choice such as personal selling may be more appropriate. For 
example, a small business selling cakes will have to use promotion to let all its possible 
customers know what products and services it offers. However, if its customers are 
spread out all over the region, personal selling may be too expensive and time-consum-
ing and the small business may have to rely on advertising in regional newspapers to 
communicate with customers, or use other agents such as tuisnywerheid (home industry) 
stores to sell on its behalf. 
9.3.2 Characteristics of the target market 
The most important decision that a small business marketer can make is to identify 
the target market for the business. A target market is the specific group of customers at 
whom the business aims its goods or services. The better you understand and define 

Chapter 9: Promotion: communicating with your market
165
your target customer, the better chance you will have of success. Once identified, this 
target customer (or target market) will influence all aspects of the business. This includes 
the product, the look of the business, the pricing – everything. If it does not know the 
target market, a small business may try to reach everyone and end up appealing to no-
one. Groups of people most likely to buy its products and the common characteristics 
among them should be identified. The idea is to build a customer profile of the people 
who have a common need and then try to satisfy that need. Some of the characteristics 
that are important include shopping patterns, transport used, disposable income, age, 
loyalty status, etc. 
9.3.3	 Nature of the product 
Certain products, by their nature, suggest certain methods of marketing rather than 
others. For example, a mass-produced, low-tech, low-priced product will be more suit- 
ed to advertising. A business selling low-priced radios, DVDs and consumables such 
as Johnny’s Audio store will probably advertise in a local newspaper such as The  
Pretoria News. By contrast, a product which is expensive and fairly high-tech may  
require personal selling. Kirby vacuum cleaners need to be demonstrated to customers 
and are more suited to personal selling.
9.3.4	 Available budget 
The selection of an advertising medium will in most instances be determined by 
available funds. Many small businesses look at what they can afford and then select 
some of the potential options. Although expensive promotion does not necessarily 
mean good promotion, the amount of money available for promotion will to a large 
extent determine the methods that the small business entrepreneur will use and the 
options that he or she will have. 
9.3.5	 Stage in the product life cycle 
As the product goes through its stages in the life cycle, the promotional mix changes. 
During the introduction stage, the main aim is to make the customers aware of the 
product. Extensive advertising and public relations will inform the target audience and 
heighten awareness levels. The use of sales promotion in this stage encourages early 
trial of the product. Personal selling can also be used to persuade retailers to carry the 
product. During the growth stage, heavy advertising and public relations continue in 
order to build brand loyalty. However, it is no longer necessary to use sales promotion 
as customers at this stage need fewer incentives to make a purchase. When the 
product reaches maturity, competition increases. In this case, persuasive and reminder 
advertising as well as sales promotion is extremely important in order to increase 
market share. As the product goes into decline, advertising and public relations are 
reduced but personal selling and sales promotion may still be continued. 

166
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
The businessperson needs to consider all these factors to determine the choice of pro-
motion method. 
9.4 STEPS IN DEVELOPING THE PROMOTION PLAN
The promotion plan consists of several distinct steps as shown in Figure 9.2. Each of 
these steps will be discussed briefl y.

9.4.1 Perform a situation analysis 
The fi rst step is to analyse the organisation in terms of what promotion is currently 
being done, what the competitors are doing and what the industry trends are. This 
step enables the organisation to determine its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and 
threats. 
9.4.2 The objectives of promotion 
Selecting the objectives of what you want to achieve with promotion is very important 
and means much more than only achieving an increase in sales. Although increased 
sales is the result that you hope to achieve, it is important to keep in mind that promotion 
deals with communication and you should think of setting a specifi c communication 
objective. Any promotion campaign has to start by stating clearly what you are trying 
to achieve. Generally communication objectives are to:
• Inform customers and potential customers of the product, service, location of the 
business, any specials and so forth. For example, if a new exercise studio opens, 
it wants to inform the market where it is, the times it will be open, fees charged, 
availability of parking, range of classes (Pilates, yoga, spinning, etc). 

Chapter 9: Promotion: communicating with your market
167
•	 Persuade customers to buy the product or try it. Whenever competition is high and 
loyalty is strong, it is more difficult to get customers to buy the product. The focus 
may then be on persuading customers to at least try the product and service before 
making a decision. For example, a motor repair business might say that BMW own-
ers should try it because the owners have been trained in BMW maintenance and 
have worked with BMWs for over 20 years. 
•	 Remind customers of the products and services. Coca-Cola is very strong in 
reminder advertising. Even though they are the best-known brand in the world they 
keep on reminding people of their product – to make sure people keep the product 
in mind when buying cooldrinks. It is also used to reassure customers who have 
already bought the product or to increase the loyalty of those who have bought 
before, making sure you have established the groundwork for possible future sales. 
For example, a nursery will use outdoor signs at the nursery keeping the market 
informed that for the past two years they have been rated the best nursery in the 
area. 
A small business will have a number of different promotional objectives. Some examples 
of these are: 
(a)  Inform
•	 Tell the market about a new product/service. 
•	 Suggest a new use for your product/service. 
•	 Tell customers about a price change. 
•	 Explain how the product/service works. 
•	 Describe available services. 
•	 Correct wrong impressions about your business. 
•	 Build up a good image.
(b)  Persuade
•	 Build up a preference for your brand.
•	 Try to get customers to switch to your brand.
•	 Get customers to buy now.
•	 Get customers to let you call on them to sell.
•	 Change the way customers think of your product/service.

168
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
(c)  Remind
•	 Remind customers that they may need your product/service.
•	 Remind customers where they can buy your product/service.
•	 Remind customers about your product/service during off-seasons.
•	 Keep customers aware of your product/service.
9.4.3	 Decide on the target audience 
Once you know what you want to achieve, you have to decide with which groups you 
are going to communicate. These groups are called the target audiences. The target au-
dience are those individuals or businesses or groups who display similar characteristics 
to whom you want to communicate your message. 
The target market would probably make up a target audience, but there could be other 
groups involved. For example, if you have just opened up a motor repair business and 
have chosen the drivers of vehicles in your immediate neighbourhood as your target 
market, then your target audiences might be the small business owners in the area, 
the housewives in the homes around you and the drivers of automobiles. Note that 
you should treat each target audience separately, because their needs and information 
requirements are different. For example, the small business owners will be concerned 
with having their vehicles available for business, the housewives might be concerned 
with safety and reliability, and the automobile drivers in the area might be concerned 
with convenience. 
It is important to find out what each target audience already knows about the business 
or product, so that you can work out what to do with your promotional effort. For ex-
ample, it is no use telling the target audiences in the example above that you are better 
at servicing cars than the franchised automobile dealers, if the target audiences do not 
know that your business exists! 
9.4.4	 Decide on the message you want to convey 
Once you know who the target audiences are, you will have to decide on your message, 
or what you want to tell them. This message will help you achieve your objectives. Your 
knowledge of your customer will be invaluable because it is important that you get and 
hold their attention and so influence them. Your customer profile, information obtained 
from research and continuous contact with customers, will help you to decide what 
to say to customers. It is critical to remember that you must decide on your message 
according to your target audience. 
Figure 9.3 highlights the components of messages.

Chapter 9: Promotion: communicating with your market
169
Message
Message form
Message content
Figure 9.3: Two components to a message
The message content is the basic idea and information that you want to get through to 
the target audience. It is important that your audience understands the message the 
way you want them to. 
The message form is the combination of verbal, visual and audio signals that present 
the message content to the target audience in the most suitable way. The longer the 
message and the more wording used, the lesser the chance in many instances that it will 
be read. A careful mix between words, colour, sound and visual display should be used. 
The selection of media will infl uence this as well. 
The content of the message is important because you have to show:
• why your product is different 
• the benefi ts that you offer to the customer 
• why the customer should buy your product rather than that of your competitor. 
The form of the message should attract attention and maintain interest long enough 
to get the message across. Sometimes an irritating radio advertisement will attract 
attention and get people to notice it. It has to stand out from all the other advertisements. 
You need to be especially careful to avoid being ambiguous; or confusing the target au-
dience. It is in this area of marketing that marketing consultants or advertising agencies 
are especially helpful. 
If you are unsure of the message that you want to put across, you can always do re-
search on your target audience to see if your message is clear and understandable, and 
has an impact on your audience. 
9.4.5 Select the promotion mix elements 
Once the message you want to convey to your target audience has been chosen, the 
organisation will have to decide on a promotional mix in order to deliver that message. 
As previously mentioned the promotional mix consists of eight elements which include 
advertising, sales promotion, publicity, personal selling, public relations, sponsorship, 
direct marketing and e-communication (Cant & Van Heerden, 2013:361–362). Each of 
these elements has its own strengths and weaknesses, so careful consideration must be 
taken when choosing the right method.

The AZ Trading promotion mix
AZ Trading is based in Gauteng and provides document presentation and document security 
solutions to its customers, focusing on office machines and office supplies. This is a very 
intensely competitive industry, so it has been careful in the selection of its promotional 
mix. It has managed to get listed in buying-group catalogues and on many dealer websites 
that feature the type of products it specialises in. It has also managed to get its products 
displayed in many retail outlets, and has been a participant and member of the industry 
association board. The company makes use of telesales to approach customers, both existing 
and new, in terms of selling its products and services. It also gets coverage of its products 
through print media, and has an active website to both support the effort and to provide 
information to clients on its products. It also participates in road shows and exhibitions to 
increase awareness of the company and its products and to generate leads.

9.4.6	 Determine the promotion budget 
Promotion is a very expensive task and usually amounts to a large part of the organisa-
tion’s total budget. It is important that the organisation sets the promotion budget at 
a level that maximises profitability and return on investment. The organisation should 
also ensure that the budget is allocated to the different promotional mix elements. 
There are many ways to determine the total amount allocated to the promotion mix. 
Some include:
•	 spending what you can afford 
•	 spend what competitors are spending 
•	 spend a percentage of last year’s sales 
•	 objective and task method. 
9.4.7	 Develop the promotion campaign 
Developing the promotional campaign consists of three steps. The first step is to de-
termine the specifics of the campaign including the media used, expenditure and time 
schedules. The second step is to ensure that these specifics are assigned to people for 
successful implementation. Third, checks must be done to ensure effective performance 
of the promotion activities. 
9.4.8	 Evaluate the results 
Finally, the campaign must be controlled and its performance evaluated. The aim of this 
step is to determine if the objectives have been met. Standards must be compared to the 
actual performance to determine if corrective actions are required.

9.5	 SUMMARY 
The use of marketing communication techniques by a small business requires the  
entrepreneur to think creatively and innovatively. This is because the communication 
campaign will require the use of scarce business resources. Thus the planning and con-
trolling of communication efforts will be of the utmost importance. As an entrepreneur 
you must be able to identify what is successful and what is not, and to ensure that all 
resources used help to achieve the overall goals of the business.

Advertising your
small business 
10
Chapter
10.1 LEARNING OUTCOMES 
After you have studied this chapter, you should be able to:  
• apply and explain the steps that need to be taken in developing an advertising campaign 
for a small business 
• select, identify and discuss the various advertising media that will be suitable for different 
small businesses 
• consider disruptive media solutions 
• understand the value and application and use of the internet as an advertising medium.    
10.2 WHAT IS ADVERTISING? 
Small businesses generally need advertising to work faster and more effectively for 
them over the short term as opposed to larger corporations who build brand loyalty 
over a longer period of time. Where a large company will focus mainly on a longer term 
strategy of brand building and sales, a small business will focus more on generating 
sales over the short term and brand loyalty over a longer period. 
Many small businesses overestimate the power of advertising and expect too much. It 
must be remembered that advertising is but one component in the mix available to the 
business. 
Advertising can be defi ned as: ‘non-personal, one way, planned messages paid for by 
an identifi ed sponsor and disseminated to a broader audience in order to infl uence their 
attitudes and behaviour’ (Cant et al, 2013:444).   
Advertising that is done well will generate positive infl uences and will hopefully lead 
towards sales. However, if the advertiser gets it wrong, the money spent on advertising 
will be wasted. Vitale (1995) writes, ‘Advertising is one of the most costly, necessary 
and yet unprecedented expenses of any business. Without it a business has little chance 
D

174
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
of surviving. With it – if the advertising is done poorly (and most of the time it is) – a 
business can still fail.’ 
The small business must plan very carefully on how it aims to advertise the business. 
In order to get the most value for advertising money spent, careful planning is needed. 
The factors that need attention in this regard are as follows: 
10.2.1		 Define the target audience
If you do not know who to market your product to, you cannot design an effective 
campaign. The first step therefore is to identify existing and potential customers of 
the business. The small business generally has limited funds available and needs to 
selectively target the market. It is not feasible for the small business to try and target the 
mass market as a lot of wastage will occur, which means money lost on non-customer 
prospects. While the market analysis will define the demographic characteristics, geo-
graphic concentration, product usage patterns and purchase habits of target markets, 
it is important to define the audience for the advertising message. There may be more 
than one target audience and so these too need to be defined. If done this way, the busi-
ness can focus on selected audiences more specifically. An example may be all teenage 
girls who are sporty and socially active in a specific suburb. They may be targeted for 
group sessions of Hip Hop dancing, fitness training and so forth. The information is 
also available on the population figures, age groups and so on which will assist the 
business to determine the potential size of the market. 
10.2.2		 Determine the advertising message
Knowing who the target audience is, their characteristics and so on, makes it easier to 
decide on the message to convey to the market. This will obviously also depend on the 
objectives set for the campaign. It makes it possible to formulate the advertisements 
in such a way that the target audience will understand the message communicated to 
them and regard it as relevant to their needs. Various models, such as the hierarchy 
of effects have been developed by advertising experts to describe the way advertising 
works and to set objectives of advertising. A popular model of the hierarchy of effects  
is AIDAS, which in layman’s terms mean the following (Van Dyk, 2014):
A:	 Attention: The advertisement must attract the attention of the selected target audi-
ence. This may be bright colour in the case of print, a loud noise in the case of radio 
or even an irritating voice.
I:	 Interest: Once the attention has been grabbed, interest in the product or service is 
needed. This may be the mention of weight loss, money back, etc. 
D:	 Desire: A desire to form part of the group, to own the product or to secure the 
benefits must be obtained. This can be the expected body perfection as a result of  
the use of the product. 

Chapter 10: Advertising your small business
175
A:	 Action: The person must be enticed to go over to action (the sale). By making it pos-
sible to join the studio for training with immediate effect by offering cash, debit or 
credit card payments can lead to action. 
S:	 Satisfaction: This refers to the customer being satisfied with what was sold to him or 
her. If this is not achieved, the potential of return business or loyalty is not possible. 
This suggests that the advertising strategy is designed to move the potential customer 
through the hierarchy of effects. A particular advertisement may however be designed 
to achieve only one of the effects in the hierarchy (for example, to attract attention or 
stimulate interest) while subsequent advertisements will build on the rest. 
You will need to define a message strategy, which will spell out the focus of the message. 
The message might focus on the benefits of the product/service or on developing/
reinforcing an image; it could focus on developing associations that are value-laden; it 
also decides on the promise. Just as in a war, strategy is half the battle. In other words, 
the message strategy is as important as advertising itself. 
To translate the strategy into an advertisement, the small business can commission an 
advertising agency or handle the work ‘in-house’ (within your business). The role of  
the advertising agency is covered later in the chapter. 
10.3	 WHERE SHOULD THE ADVERTISEMENTS BE PLACED?
You may have the best designed advertisement, but if placed in the wrong media, it will 
be a waste of money and effort. Placing an advertisement in the right media is based 
on the identified target audience (showing once again why the selection of the target 
audience is so crucial to the campaign). The media selected is critical to the success of 
the total advertising campaign. 
Media are the vehicles (or channels) through which advertising messages are transmitted 
to the target markets. It is important to select the right media which will reach the target 
audience, and to make sure that costs are kept as low as possible. Selecting the most 
appropriate advertising media presents a challenge, especially for small businesses 
with limited budgets. Many factors can and will influence the media to be used and it is 
the task of the small businessperson to be aware of these factors and to take them into 
consideration when deciding on the media. 
10.3.1		 Factors influencing the selection of media
The choice of media will depend on a variety of factors which include the following: 
(a)  Geographic concentration of market 
The greater the geographic spread of the target audience, the larger the range of media 
options available to the small business, and vice versa. For example, if all the customers 

176
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
of a retailer live within a half-kilometre radius of the business, it will be more effective 
to distribute pamphlets than to use newspapers or radio. If, for example, the whole of 
the Tshwane area is the target market area for a furniture business such as Lewis stores, 
radio and local newspapers may be more suitable media. 
(b)  Demographic and psychographic characteristics of the target market 
Each target market has its own unique characteristics and can be defined according to 
certain factors, such as age, gender, location and lifestyle. The selection of media should 
suit the market. Customers of an upmarket restaurant will probably appreciate publicity 
articles in newspapers and magazines, whereas patrons of a local pub and grill will be 
more effectively reached by means of outdoor signs. An important demographic factor 
to consider in South Africa is literacy. If the target audience is mostly illiterate, it stands 
to reason that printed media cannot be used, but rather radio. This also will impact on 
the type of words and phrases used. 
(c)  Costs 
One of the most restrictive factors for a small business is the amount of money avail-
able. Most small businesses have very limited funds available and cannot afford long 
drawn-out campaigns. They need media that is affordable and which will reach the 
target market at a reasonable cost. A major mistake many small businesses make is to 
select media solely on price. In many cases the cheapest may be the worst because the 
message will not reach the target audience. A small budget can, however, be utilised 
effectively with dramatic effect. This implies that the businessperson knows his or her 
market and the available media to reach the market. 
(d)  Varying advertising costs 
There are marked differences in cost between and within the types of media. For in-
stance, there are different tariffs for advertising on radio and in a newspaper. Within a 
newspaper, there are different costs depending on the colour, size and position of the 
advertisement. The potential reach of each medium must be taken into consideration 
when deciding on the media. 
(e)  Frequency of message 
To have an effect, an advertisement will have to be broadcast more than once. For ex-
ample, one slot on DSTV will not have any effect, but four slots a day for a week or two 
will. Similarly a once-off advertisement in a newspaper will be ineffective. Repetition is 
needed if any impact is to be achieved. 
The small business entrepreneur (or owner) can make use of a variety of advertising 
media, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. In the following sections, we 
will look at each medium option in terms of its potential for success for small businesses. 

Chapter 10: Advertising your small business
177
10.3.2		 Radio advertising
Radio is a medium quite extensively used by small businesses due to the relative inex-
pensiveness, reach, targeted audiences and ease of use. Radio is a source of entertain-
ment, information and companionship, and is available to advertisers on a community, 
regional and national basis. It is a very important medium in South Africa because of its 
wide penetration in the population. 
Radio is used effectively in the building of familiarity and involvement with a product 
or service. The human voice is a powerful selling aid and, when reinforced by local and 
topical content, is a very personal medium. Station personalities normally have great 
rapport with their listeners and are especially valuable for endorsing products. Think of 
DJ Fresh on 5FM with his wide appeal and popularity. Many small businesses use him 
to read their messages, as the appeal is so much higher. 
Programming is designed to target distinct audiences, and advertisements are normally 
quick and easy to produce and update. Radio airtime is usually purchased in packages, 
and is relatively inexpensive compared to television advertising. Given the fact that 
radio advertisements are short and have no visual support, the script and jingles need to 
be short, catchy and memorable. How many times have you not found yourself singing 
along to the tune of an advertisement? Repetition is also necessary since there is no 
guarantee that your target audience will hear the advertisement when first broadcast. 
It is important to know something about the listening patterns of potential customers. 
You can contact radio stations to obtain information on the type of programming, mu-
sical format, geographical reach, number of listeners and station ratings, for example. 
Many stations offer opportunities to sponsor various programmes. 
Community radio has become an important addition to the medium. Advertising rates 
are lower than that of national radio and it is strongly focused on a particular geo-
graphic area. Some stations offer attractive packages, often including the production of 
the advertisement. 
10.3.3		 Newspaper advertising, display advertisements and 
	
	 classifieds
A viable medium for many small businesses is the use of newspapers. Newspapers 
include national daily newspapers, national Sunday newspapers, regional daily news-
papers and local community newspapers (known as ‘free sheets’). 
National newspapers offer very high circulation and wide coverage, whereas local 
newspapers reach a more targeted audience. Most small businesses advertise in local 
newspapers or ‘buy’ specific delivery zones of newspapers instead of advertising in 
the full run of a national publication. So for instance The Pretoria News will focus on the 
Tshwane area which is a large geographical area, and The Record will be a small sub-
urban newspaper distributed in a few suburbs of a town. 

178
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
The following factors need to be considered when advertising in newspapers:
•	 Properly planned, newspaper advertising can be a relatively cost-effective method 
of advertising. Advertisements are sold by column and inch. 
•	 Newspapers cover specific geographical areas, which allows for more ‘focused’ 
advertising. 
•	 Newspapers are fairly flexible about the positioning and type of advertisements that 
can be inserted. Advertisements can be designed, purchased and altered at short 
notice. 
•	 Newspaper sales representatives might offer to help in designing the layout and 
copy of your advertisement, and should keep you posted on upcoming special 
sections or promotions. It might be advisable to approach a graphic design or 
advertising agency if you want your advertisement to stand out, particularly if you 
want an integrated message across several promotional instruments. 
•	 Newspapers generally have a very short life span (usually one day). 
•	 Readership and circulation must be considered before a particular newspaper is 
selected. For example, circulation drops on Saturdays and increases on Sundays, 
which is also the day that the newspaper is read most thoroughly. Although 
circulation figures might be high, there is no assurance of readership. 
•	 Position or location of the advertisement is important. A smaller advertisement can 
get lost in a large page. If your advertisement includes a coupon, try to have it 
placed at the edge of the page to make it easier for the reader to cut out the coupon. 
The use of colour makes it stand out from other advertisements. It may be a little 
more expensive but if it is, for example, the only blue section in an otherwise black 
and white page, it will be noticed. 
•	 The print quality of newspapers is often inferior. 
•	 High information content is possible. Newspaper advertisements can incorporate 
information about the product/service. 
Classified sections are typically found towards the end of the newspaper, although there 
are also specialised papers that contain only classified advertisements. As the name 
suggests, classified advertisements are categorised into sections. Such advertisements 
are similar in appearance and packed together in narrow columns; they are generally 
not visually appealing. The difference here is that these advertisements are perused 
by readers and attract attention through the classifications under which they appear. 
You can be creative in the design of classified advertisements and it is very important 
to be consistent. Look at the advertisements in the services section for example. There 
is a heading, ‘Au Pairs’, and the advertisement for an au pair which uses a bold font, 
slightly larger in print size and blocked stands out more than the advertisements of 
other au pairs. It is also eye-catching. 

Chapter 10: Advertising your small business
179
10.3.4		 Direct mail advertising
Many small businesses make use of leaflets, for example, to market their products 
or services. These are distributed all over and the effectiveness can be linked to the 
structure of the content of such a brochure. The phrase ‘20% off if you produce this 
advert with your order’ is a means of measuring the effectiveness of the leaflet. Direct 
marketing is one of the most accountable forms of advertising tools, since both costs  
and results can be precisely measured. Furthermore, it allows a business to understand 
the needs and preferences of its customers and so move closer to the customer base. More 
intimate relationships with customers will almost certainly give smaller businesses the 
competitive edge over larger companies. 
Direct mail is one of the oldest methods used by marketers to communicate with buyers. 
Direct mail is defined as personally addressed communications sent through the postal 
service.   
Direct mail may employ letters, catalogues, price lists, brochures, leaflets, circulars, 
newsletters, cards and samples. The one major drawback, however, is the fact that the 
postal service in South Africa is at best suspect in terms of reliability. 
There are three aspects to a direct mail campaign, namely:
•	 The mailing list which includes existing and potential customers. The list may be 
developed by the business, or purchased during start-up. 
•	 The proposition which should be designed to encourage recipients to respond. 
Accuracy of information and a simple response mechanism are important. 
•	 Creativity in the mail shot (printed material mailed to people whose names appear 
on the mailing list) is more likely to be read and remembered and creative mail shots 
are less likely to be discarded as ‘junk mail’. 
While direct mail allows for focused targeting, highly personalised information content 
and the stimulation of direct response, great care has to be taken to ensure that it is not 
perceived as junk mail. Responses need to be monitored to update a database for future 
use. It must be expected that the response rate will in most cases be between 2% and 
5% only. 
10.3.5		 Signs and displays
Signage is a key component of developing and maintaining an identity for your busi-
ness. Signs appear on business premises, letterheads, business cards, cars and trucks 
and employee uniforms, all of which present the opportunity to communicate a con-
sistent message to the target market. Signs and displays are often considered as part of 
D

180
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
public relations, but they also serve an advertising purpose. It is your task as a small 
businessperson to ensure that the signage is easy to understand and effective in draw-
ing attention. 
10.3.6		 Television advertising
Very few small businesses can afford TV advertising but it is discussed here mainly 
to be complete in the avenues available. Television is sometimes referred to as the 
‘king’ of media. This is because it reaches such a large audience. Comprehensive data 
on television audiences is available, enabling the advertiser to identify and target the 
desired audience profile. The cost of commercials is based on the number of viewers 
who watch the programme and the time of day when the programme is aired. However, 
the high costs of production and airtime normally make television advertisements too 
expensive for small businesses. A 30-second television commercial in prime time could 
cost between R500 000 and R800 000. Cheaper 30-second slots in off-peak hours will 
be lower. (Certain variables, such as station, programme and average audience rating, 
time of year and target market, need to be taken into account.)
Television demands a high degree of creativity in production because commercials 
must compete with other commercials and elements in the viewer’s environment. 
Fortunately, the medium allows for great creative flexibility and appeals to the senses 
through the use of sight, sound, colour and movement. This invariably requires the in- 
put of an advertising agency. Small business advertisers who operate with limited 
budgets can contact local stations and ask for details on budget packages and rates for 
first-time users. Although this might mean that advertisements are flighted during off-
peak hours, this may be appropriate for the business’s target audience. Other factors to 
consider include long lead-times (for production and media scheduling) and informa-
tion content constraints (duration of advertisements: 30 or 60 seconds). 
Regional television advertising 
There is also the option of advertising on regional television (for example, KZN Tonight). 
Given the fact that the target audience of a small business is normally quite small, this 
may be a realistic, cheaper and equally effective alternative. 
10.3.7		 Magazine advertising
More and more medium-sized businesses are making use of magazines to market 
their products. These are normally businesses who sell via other outlets or through 
mail order. Many of the principles that apply to newspapers also apply to magazine 
advertising. There are two categories of magazines: consumer magazines include 
general or specific-interest magazines; trade magazines are aimed at specific types 
of businesses. This categorisation allows for considerable selectivity. It is likely that 
customers who buy special-interest magazines will be interested in the type of products 

Chapter 10: Advertising your small business
181
or services that are advertised in them (for example, Ideas readers will have an interest 
in DIY and crafts). 
Magazines are usually weekly or monthly publications and have an extended life 
(readers usually keep them or pass them on to other people). While the quality of the 
print and paper and creative flexibility is superior to those of newspapers, the costs of 
space and production can be high. Advertising messages in magazines are normally 
more image-oriented and less price-oriented. 
The advertising office of a particular publication can provide a ‘media kit’ containing 
information on demographics (age, sex, income level, etc), reach, readership and circu-
lation, and also as a sample of the publication. 
Specialist publications 
These may provide more appropriate print options for small businesses. A magazine 
such as Magnum or SA Hunter is aimed at a very specific readership and many small 
businesses use this to sell, for example, outdoor clothes, guns, accessories for hunting, 
hunting opportunities and so forth. It is affordable and speaks directly to its target 
audience. Trade publications such as Supermarket and Retailer for example, are viable 
media options because they are targeted at specific groups. 
10.3.8		 Outdoor advertising
Outdoor advertising, including posters and transit advertising, is normally positioned 
in areas of high-volume traffic to deliver a high opportunity to see (OTS) rating. The 
outdoor advertising industry offers excellent market coverage and frequency, while 
having an enormous impact. It remains one of the most cost-effective ways to reach 
audiences across all Living Standards Measure (LSM) groups – a categorisation of 
South Africans based on specific lifestyle measures. It is possible to share the cost of 
outdoor advertisements with suppliers, manufacturers or other businesses by featuring 
their product or service. 
At the point of purchase (supermarket checkout till, petrol station, etc), poster 
advertising provides an excellent trigger. In the case of billboards or mobile advertising, 
however, people often catch only a fleeting glimpse so the message has to be short and 
simple. There are certain legal and environmental regulations as to where billboards can 
be placed. There are also businesses that specialise in outdoor advertising as a medium. 
They take full responsibility for messages, maintenance of billboards, etc. 
Some of the more popular forms of this diverse medium are:
•	 billboard and poster advertising along roadsides, in shopping centres and on 
benches or bins 
•	 station and on-board advertising, which includes posters appearing in bus shelters 
and on trains, buses and taxis 

182
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
•	 mobile advertising on trailers, vehicle and truck fleets which carry posters and mes-
sages. Many small businesses use this option to market their services as it is durable 
and flexible. 
10.3.9		 Publicity and other low or no-cost advertising
The value of publicity for the small business is generally underrated by businesspeople. 
Appearing as a guest on a radio or television talk show or interview-type programme 
provides good publicity. Newspapers, especially, are always on the lookout for filler 
articles on some topic or other and by contacting them with a new idea, concept or  
even community project can lead to a write-up and exposure in the market. If you 
want to pursue this option, write a letter to the producers or journalists of various 
programmes and newspapers and follow up with a personal visit or telephone call. 
Likewise, you can submit articles to related publications to increase the visibility of 
your company and establish your expertise in a particular field. 
Posting advertising circulars on free bulletin boards – for example, in libraries, shop-
ping centres, supermarkets and hair and beauty salons – can increase awareness of 
the business. You can hand out pamphlets at shopping centres or place them under 
windscreen wipers in parking lots. Office stationery can also be printed with advertis-
ing messages. 
Seek out referrals from previous customers, as this is a good way to develop a ‘satisfied 
client’ list, which can then be used in advertisements. 
10.3.10 	Speciality advertising, including giveaways and 
	
	 	 promotional items
Speciality advertising are articles on which the company’s name or logo appears. Ex-
amples are office stationery, flash drives, mouse pads, calendars and T-shirts. The value 
of these items have however been diminished over the years as many companies are 
doing this now and the choices are limited. 
One company however has succeeded in getting much mileage out of these types of 
items by being innovative and proactive. Ettienne and Co. Attorneys, located in Bloem-
fontein decided to hand out stainless steel coffee mugs to companies instead of a bro-
chure. The coffee mug is designed for customers on-the-go, the company details and 
its services have been printed on the mugs, and it was sourced from China at a very 
low price. Also, when hot liquid is poured into the mug, the company logo becomes 
bright and noticeable on the side. The company only hands out these mugs to selected 
customers and not to all and sundry. The life span of the item is long and due to the fact 
that the Ettienne and Co. Attorneys logo is on the mug, the life span of the advertising 
is pretty long and it will become a talking point among individuals. 

Chapter 10: Advertising your small business
183
10.3.11  Trade shows 
There are numerous trade shows that can be used by small businesses. Trade shows 
make use of display booths set up by businesses to display their products or services 
to potential customers. Trade shows include computer, baby, crafts and DIY, wedding, 
building and garden design fairs and exhibitions. 
10.3.12  Electronic media and social networks
The use of electronic media such as email has gained momentum over the past years. 
More and more small businesses are using the internet to send out messages to potential 
customers. Unfortunately spamming has become a major problem for many people and 
small businesses who partake in these activities face the threat of blacklisting. Social 
media such as Facebook and Twitter can be used to also promote and market a business. 
These media reach a huge number of people and the use of these media is still in its 
infancy. These and other electronic media are discussed in section 10.5 in more detail.
10.3.13  Yellow Pages or directory advertising
As specific reference publications, directories allow for highly targeted advertising. In-
dustrial and commercial directories are used almost exclusively by buyers in particular 
fields. Prospective customers can easily locate and contact your business, provided that 
they know who you are and what classification to look for in the first place. The ad-
vantage of this for small and medium businesses is that a single advertisement works 
for a whole year. The disadvantage is that this implies long lead-times. The cost of 
utilising this medium is largely dependent on what competitors are doing within the 
same industry. To stand out from the competition, a business might opt for a full-page 
colour advertisement. Advertisements should be large enough to incorporate vital in-
formation for the reader to make contact. Advertisements must be simple, unique and 
attention-grabbing. 
Remember that directory advertising is about providing information to a customer who is 
actively seeking the advertiser. Much of the ‘sell copy’ for a product or service is unnecessary 
since people have already looked the business up. Consequently, it serves as an excellent 
support medium. 
10.4	 DISRUPTIVE SOLUTIONS 
Even though television is often out of reach, small and medium businesses have many 
different media options to choose from. There is a danger of falling into the trap of 
being caught up in the glamour of advertising. It’s not always a solution to the problem 
to direct your entire budget into expensive television campaigns which may not 
necessarily be the best way of building your brand.

According to Chronis (2001), alternative or non-traditional media is proving highly ef-
fective in a world cluttered by marketing messages. When it comes to media outside 
the mainstream, there is an almost limitless choice. It seems you can put your market-
ing message on just about anything these days – from TVs in public transport like the 
Gautrain and garage car washes, to loyalty cards and even inside the lids of cereal 
boxes. And if a medium doesn’t exist, you can usually find someone who’d be happy to 
create one for you. With alternative media the options are boundless and, when prop-
erly utilised, so is the value. 
Clearly, small businesses can employ a host of different, exciting, innovative and highly 
effective methods of advertising. These include:
•	 SMS competitions on cereal boxes and chocolates where entrants can win airtime 
and cash
•	 competitions and sweepstakes on social media like Facebook and Twitter
•	 advertisements on restaurant menus 
•	 Pick n Pay offers their Smart Shoppers special offers on the back of their till slips, 
where a till roll is shared with other advertisers (the ability to advertise in small local 
areas maximises cost-effectiveness, reduces wastage and gets the message directly 
into the customer’s hand) 
•	 advertisements at the back of toilet stalls in shopping malls in cinemas, clubs and 
restaurants (A4 posters slid into frames mounted on doors are often used to great 
effect) 
•	 queuing media, which include light boxes, display cabinets, interactive promotions, 
belt advertising (queuing belts in cinemas, banks, post offices, etc) and floor graph-
ics in foyer and lobby areas throughout the country. 
In seeking to make messages stand out amidst traditional marketing clutter, Grossmann 
(2000) explains that ‘new types of advertisements are popping up everywhere and 
you’ll find them at the bottom of golf courses, on the ceilings of hair salons above hair 
washing basins, on the roofs on taxicabs, on retailer loyalty cards, on hotel room key 
cards, on sponsored vehicles driven by celebrities and sports stars’. 
Creativity rules the advertising world, and this is evident in these disruptive solutions. 
For example, a commercial for Woof! dog food, which produces dog food, treats and ac- 
cessories, shows a dog howling at five o’clock in the morning as he sits at the back 
door of a house. The dog owner looks out of his bedroom window and tells the dog to 
be quiet because he does not want to disturb the neighbours. After a few minutes, the 
neighbours next door turns on all the lights in their house and the dog owner knows 
he’s in trouble. The dog continues to howl and bark and does not quieten down until 
the owner throws one of the Woof! treats out of the window. The dog immediately runs 
and fetches the treat and peace is restored to the neighbourhood.

List other disruptive solutions that you can create for small and medium advertisers 
that will both have an impact on and reach a large number of potential customers. 
10.5	 NEW APPROACHES: THE INTERNET
The changes occurring in the business environment continually provide marketers and 
advertisers with new opportunities. Nowhere is this more evident than in the rise of 
the internet, and particularly the World Wide Web (www). In this section, we will look 
at internet advertising, email marketing and the use of text messaging such as SMS, 
WhatsApp and MXit applications. 
10.5.1		 Web advertising
The advent of the internet has changed the way we do business. For many small busi-
nesses, the internet can be an economical and efficient way to market to customers. By 
fostering new and different forms of interaction, it ensures low-cost, real-time interac-
tivity between vast numbers of people worldwide. 
Advertising on the internet can take a number of different forms. The multi-media 
capabilities of the web allow advertisers to use colour, graphics, movement, video and 
even sound. Typically, businesses use their websites as vehicles to advertise themselves 
and their products or services. 
‘Many small business owners are under the illusion that creating a website will auto-
matically cause people to flock to it. Unfortunately, the opposite is true. It is getting 
harder and harder for smaller sites to cut through all the noise and clutter of the Web to 
get noticed.’ (BRAIN, 2010)
You can obtain articles on website marketing from business-money-making.com and 
marketingtips.com. Local.biz.co.za is an example of a site where small and medium 
enterprises (SMEs) in South Africa can obtain a listing on a business index and have 
their own web page. Sites such as these provide SMEs with effective, yet inexpensive, 
internet advertising and online exposure. 
The use of websites is measured by indicators such as click-through rates (number of 
times users click on a particular feature, such as a banner advertisement) and page 
views (the number of times a particular page is requested from a computer server). 
It is important to remember that high click-through rates and page views do not 
necessarily mean that the site is successful. To measure success accurately, the small 
business entrepreneur needs to examine more meaningful data, such as visitor profiles 
and online behaviour. 
Banner advertising on established sites that cater for desired target audiences is also 
very common. Banner advertising is a type of advertisement appearing as a banner 

186
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
(horizontal band) across the whole or part of the width of a web page. The costs of 
banner advertisements vary between agencies and developers. A banner exchange is 
available, for example, at smartclicks.com where a banner advertisement can receive 
a specific number of exposures on other member websites. Banner advertisements is 
very important as they are considered the offline advertising which is part of offline 
campaign so banners that provide no incentive to ‘click here’, or that sport the wrong 
company logo, can actually damage the reputation of a business. 
It is important to recognise the distinct advantages of using the internet as an advertising 
medium. However, there are two important things to bear in mind. 
First, only a small percentage of the South African population (fewer than two million 
as at 2000) has internet access (although this is growing). Therefore, a business needs to 
consider whether its target market can be reached by this medium. Second, it is offline 
advertising that drives online advertising success and offline advertising should be the 
funnel to a specific online site. In the South African context, the online medium may be 
better suited for business-to-business (B2B) selling. 
10.5.2		 Email marketing
Email marketing allows the marketer to benefit from powerful new capabilities – fast 
campaign testing and execution, the ability to customise messages and the capacity 
for immediate response analysis. Email is a tool that allows marketers to provide 
customers with compelling reasons to buy a particular product or service (LaPla, 2000). 
By using new e-marketing tools, the small business can create a personalised dialogue 
with its customers and customise product or service offerings according to customers’ 
specific needs and wants. At the same time, the business can focus its efforts on its most 
valuable customers. 
The first step in email marketing is to learn as much as possible about your customers 
(the target market) so that you can send them information at the right time that they 
will find relevant and respond to. This calls for a proper way of storing customer 
information and managing responses; this can be done by establishing a database. The 
database updates customer profiles and can include simple contact details or complex 
response and purchase histories. 
Many small business owners market their products and services through newsgroups 
and mailing lists. These provide the benefit of reaching a highly targeted audience and 
the opportunity to network with other businesses, prospect for customers and increase 
the visibility of the company. Newsgroups are general discussion groups in which a 
person posts a message to the group and the message is distributed all over the world 
to different news servers. Mailing lists are groups of people who communicate by 
email about a particular subject. (Consumers can now sign up to receive commercial 
email messages about topics of interest.) The company can respond to queries and 

Chapter 10: Advertising your small business
187
comments, thereby increasing exposure of its products and their benefits. Dejanews.
com, for example, provides details of different newsgroups and liszt.com is a searchable 
directory of mailing lists. 
Pieterse (2001) mentions that ‘an electronic newsletter is one of the most powerful 
weapons small businesses can use to market their products or services. It’s an effective 
way of building good relations with clients and costs little … the main advantage is that 
clients actually want to receive one, which means that it is not unsolicited advertising.’ 
10.5.3		 Text message/SMS advertisements
A new form of advertising, which capitalises on the exponential growth in ownership 
of cellphones, is the use of text messaging such as the Short Messaging Service (SMS), 
WhatsApp, Black Berry Messenger and MXit for advertising purposes. A small business 
entrepreneur could make use of these mediums to announce a special offer or a new 
product or service. Compiling a database of customers’ cellphone numbers and pins is 
critical to the use of these applications. A disadvantage might be offending customers 
by invading their privacy. Customer permission should be requested in advance. 
StudentNotes.co.za
Studentnotes.co.za launched in 2010 and its goal was simple: to provide quality study notes 
to university students created by other students. During its first three years, the company 
had to develop from an unknown brand to one that is readily recognisable at nearly all the 
universities in South Africa. 
It was decided that the first step in the marketing process would be posters and flyers; it 
worked for the founder when he initially sold his notes on campus, so surely it would work 
again? The founder took the designs to the University of Pretoria campus where he was 
studying and he printed 500 flyers and 20 posters. The initial marketing had some success: 
people were actually visiting the website and downloading some of the free notes and 
by using Google Analytics the founder could see that most of the visitors were from the 
Pretoria area where he had done his marketing. There were, however, no new uploads of 
notes, nor did anyone purchase the few premium notes. 
After a few months, it was decided to get some free advertising space. The founder emailed 
the Department of Education, 62 newspapers and 14 radio stations across South Africa and 
provided them with a marketing release about the website. Weeks went by with no replies 
from any of the recipients. Finally, a journalist from Die Matie newspaper (the University of 
Stellenbosch newspaper) contacted the founder of Studentnotes.co.za. She explained that 
the newspaper was interested in the story and that it would do a small piece on it. The 
response from this piece was by no means spectacular, but it meant that free exposure for 
the website has been obtained at a university other than the University of Pretoria.       ➠

188
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
While all the other marketing processes were ongoing, the social networking platforms 
were being utilised, a fan page and a normal friends page was created on Facebook. The 
fan page was used to create the real marketing platform on Facebook. The hits on the 
Studentnotes.co.za website that originated from Facebook were starting to grow. To this 
day a large proportion of new users of Studentnotes.co.za come from Facebook.
10.6	 SUMMARY 
Generating positive, cost-effective communication with customers and potential cus-
tomers is essential for any small business. The process involved in developing an  
advertising campaign for a small business is the first topic of discussion in this chap-
ter followed by the various advertising media that can be utilised for different small 
businesses. Disruptive media solutions are also explained and emphasis is placed on 
convincing small business to switch to using alternative and digital media. The chapter 
concludes with a discussion on the importance of utilising the internet as an advertis-
ing medium.
Self-evaluation questions 
1.	
If you were the founder of Studentnotes.co.za, which other inexpensive 
advertising medium would you have used during the company’s first few 
years of operation?
2.	
In your opinion, do you believe radio and television advertising would have 
been an effective advertising strategy to use?
3.	
Which advertising strategies to you think Studentnotes.co.za should employ 
in the future?

11.2 INTRODUCTION 
Entrepreneurs have a different mind-set and they should always be looking for new 
ideas, new opportunities, new designs, new solutions and innovation. Entrepreneurs 
are those who want to fi ll all sorts of gaps even if they are already running a successful 
business. They believe there is always room for improvement – the improvement can 

Chapter 11: Operations management
191
manifest by different means such as a new business idea coming to fruition, or a new 
business going to the next level or a weak business that is re-engineered to a success 
story.
Most successful entrepreneurs achieved results because of, and also in terms of, 
operations management. To copy what everyone else is doing or to simply buy a 
franchise is not real entrepreneurship. The global market needs dynamics in terms of 
agility, which is the ability to respond to market needs and opportunities. In this context, 
operations management refers to innovation, improved designs (of products, services 
and processes), time-to-market, customisation, creative distribution, servitisation and 
others. In the context of a settled business, the essence of operations management is to 
transform inputs, to add value, to be productive (efficient and effective) and to always 
seek ways to do things better.
Entrepreneurs usually have an interest in new developments: either to help them with 
their business idea, or to create and market their own technology. Technology is associ-
ated with new gadgets, devices, machines, or processing which make life easier. Tech-
nology involves all applicable operations, materials and knowledge in order to satisfy 
a need with a view to improve people’s private or work environments. This includes 
discoveries and inventions, provided that they can be applied economically. 
11.2.1		 Inspiring inventors and inventions 
The innovative economy will see how innovative capacity is spurred by technological 
externalities and more innovative supply chains. Organisational agility (eg mass cus-
tomisation) will become the skill of the future. This will enable operations to respond 
with minimum disruption in terms of business process re-configurability. Service opera-
tions will increase and concepts related to service innovation, servitisation, deployment 
of service innovations, productisation of services and servitisation of products will  
become more relevant.
There is a leader behind every success story and in the eyes of many sport lovers one 
of many Scottish creations that stands head and shoulders above the rest is golf. The 
royal game has its roots in Scotland from the 15th century onwards. This game became 
one of the highest paid industries. The Scots have given many other gifts to the world – 
they invented the television, the fax machine, the telephone, the refrigerator, the steam 
engine locomotive, the speedometer, the MRI scanner and many others. 
The Falkirk Wheel in Scotland 
The world’s first rotating boatlift is not only a unique massive steel construction but a 
symbol celebrating the dawn of Scotland’s new canal age. The Falkirk Wheel is Scotland’s 
most exciting example of 21st century engineering designed to raise and lower boats 
between two different-height canals. In combining creative art and operations design, they
➠ 
eg

Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
produced a dramatic moving sculpture that is far from conventional. The wheel weighs 1 
200 tonnes and the boatlift is 35 metres high and 27 metres long. Boat journeys through 
the wheel take only 15 minutes overall.
The well-known entrepreneurs, such as Bill Gates, Richard Branson, Adrian Gore and 
Warren Buffet have a lot to teach us. They have different philosophies and ‘lessons 
for greatness’. But all of them have one thing in common – creativity. Howard Schultz 
(Starbucks) focuses on investing in people who can be creative. Adrian Gore (Discovery 
Health) believes in pushing people to look for innovative solutions and to do things 
differently and create value for all involved. Richard Branson believes greatness moves 
past the conventional. All these leaders have a wide variety of good ideas and multiple 
operations (eg Virgin) to make things happen.
South African inventions 
The following are a few examples of creative ideas that were transformed into top inventions 
by South Africans:
•	 The public hates to stand in queues, so the idea to buy tickets for entertainment, before 
the event, was germinated to solve the problem. Computicket was invented – the first 
computerised ticket-sales system in the world. 
•	 The popular idea to get a device (process technology) that will clean the pool for you. 
Operations skills made the idea a reality. KreepyKrauly – an automatic pool-cleaning 
device was originally a South African invention (now owned by an American company). 
Other pool-cleaning devices that originated in South African include brand names, like 
Baracuda and Pool Ranger. 
•	 The glue that really does the trick – Pratley’s Putty – a two-part clay-like mixture which 
bonds into a very hard and strong compound. Operational skills made this idea an 
invention. 
•	 The idea to increase the sales of pure fruit juice: Appletiser and Grapetiser – pure fruit 
juice recipes in a sparkling format.

11.3	 BASIC CONCEPTS OF OM 
This chapter focuses on general OM terms, core concepts, principles and functions. 
This chapter will help any student in entrepreneurship who is unfamiliar with (OM) to 
establish a learning foundation for what is also called ‘POM’ (production and operations 
eg

Chapter 11: Operations management
193
management). The emphasis is on the basic OM body of knowledge in terms of the 
needs of entrepreneurs who usually start small. The contents will be focused more on 
important OM principles and typical small business operations than on large, complex 
systems, large projects or mechanised continuous operations. 
11.3.1		 Definitions of OM
Everything we see around us, sit on, eat, read, wear, buy and enjoy comes to us cour-
tesy of operations managers who planned and controlled the operations systems  
involved.
•	 Operations management (OM) is very challenging and satisfying because it creates 
all valuable, therefore sellable things, and everyone lives by selling something. OM 
is, therefore, for those who like to be creative and make things happen … not for 
those who only dream, watch things happen and wonder what happened! 
•	 Creating good ideas, making products and providing services is the ultimate 
purpose of any business and all managers are, in fact, operations managers. 
Operations management is the business function that is concerned with making 
products and providing services. Production management was the term used in the 
past for the manufacturing of products. Today, we use the term OM to cover both 
manufacturing and service delivery organisations. 
•	 Operations management (OM) gets as close as we can in business life to the act of 
creation. It is concerned with creating the products and services upon which we all 
depend. OM is about change, creativity, productivity and adding value. Since this is 
the very reason for any organisation’s existence, operations management should be 
at the heart of its affairs. 
•	 No factory produces goods for the sake of staying busy, or transforms or assembles 
resources just for fun. All OM managers are value-driven, a pursuit during which the  
worth of all inputs is increased by each transformation process in the eyes of the 
next customer in the process. Hence, the focus of this chapter is on value and, more 
specifically, on its main dimension, time and the processes linked by people as value 
chains. 
•	 The essence of any transformation process (be it micro, macro or any manufacturing 
system) is to add value and eliminate waste. This brings us to the familiar age-
old concepts of productivity, effectiveness and efficiency. All OM concepts relate to 
optimising resources, which implies value. Most of these OM principles relate to 
the well-known JIT (just-in-time) philosophy. JIT systems eliminate waste, promote 
value-adding activities, quality and focus on lead-time reduction. 
It is clear that OM is a dynamic and creative discipline. Business life is primarily 
concerned with creating goods and services, putting operations management at the 

194
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
heart of its existence. Whether micro or macro-processes are concerned, students will 
realise that all managers directly and indirectly transform resources and create products 
and/or services for internal and external customers. 
11.3.2		 OM functions
Operations management involves the following primary functions:
1.	 product and service design (demand creativity) 
2.	 demand and capacity planning 
3.	 operations system design (demand creativity) 
4.	 production planning and control 
5.	 improvement, problem-solving and maintenance (demand creativity). 
All entrepreneurs and managers, irrespective of their job title, create products and 
services for customers. In this sense, all managers are operations managers. Slack et al 
(2004:xi) states how challenging OM is becoming. Managers have to find solutions to 
technological and environmental challenges, the pressures to be socially responsible, the 
increasing globalisation of markets and knowledge management. All these challenges 
signal a positive message to potential entrepreneurs. They do not need to or have to, 
but they can get involved if they want to. 
11.3.3		 OM demands creativity
Many people have good ideas which they find difficult to operationalise. Brainstorming 
sessions in general are fun, interesting and they usually produce several good ideas, 
which are never realised in practice. Unfortunately, it is due to a lack of technical and 
operational skills. Creativity should, therefore, go beyond good product, market and 
advertising ideas: it must especially focus on operations. 
Creative ideas can have a large impact on operations – on the processes (optimising,  
simplification, streamlining), product packages, systems, technology, infrastructure, lay- 
out, resources and combinations thereof. If simple techniques, like learning to think 
and innovate can generate ideas causing significant savings or improvements, then one 
can understand why OM is associated with the excitement experienced by innovative 
organisations. It can have an enormous financial impact on a business. Researchers, 
therefore, need to live in an environment in which ideas spawn new concepts that, in 
turn, lead to new products and new technology or system designs, which may lead to 
improved or new business operations. 

Chapter 11: Operations management
195
11.3.4		 OM and process management
Stevenson (2012) refers to process management as a central role of all management. 
The processes associated within the different functional areas are the following three 
process categories:
•	 Upper management processes refer to governing, visioning, designing, strategising, 
and so forth.
•	 Operational processes are the core functional processes (such as purchasing, 
production and marketing) that make up the value stream.
•	 Supporting processes such as information technology, accounting and human 
resources management.
All operations have certain ‘creative’ process technologies, which assist the trans-
formation process and make production easier. Here, we refer to all sorts of machines, 
alarms, gadgets and gauges to support the primary process. Trolleys, scales, racks, 
cleaning tools, mechanical tools, calibration of filters and machinery set-up are a few 
examples. 
It is therefore important to understand that the transformation process is not confined 
to the factory. A process view of the business is important because an organisation is 
only as effective as its processes. Processes cut across departmental boundaries and this 
view goes beyond the main manufacturing process. 
This ‘nested-process’ concept reinforces the need to understand the interconnectivity 
of all processes and operations in the business. This also helps people to understand 
how their small contribution adds value to the whole operating value chain, which is 
the cumulative work of all processes in the business. Value to the customer at a loss 
or expense for the business is not productive, sustainable or profitable. The people in 
any operation are the catalyst that makes the whole operation come alive (Slack et al, 
2004:121). 
The processing time as such is not the only factor that determines how long it takes 
to complete a particular job. OM always attempts to reduce or eliminate lead-time 
elements in a process. The primary lead-time elements are as follows:
•	 Queue time: the period during which a job stays in the queue at a work centre 
•	 Processing time: the actual time needed to process the job 
•	 Set-up time: the time needed to prepare equipment for processing a new job
•	 Waiting time: the idle time between the processing of a job and its passage to the 
next work centre 

196
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
•	 Inspection time: the time needed to check whether the job complies with quality 
standards
•	 Transportation time: the time needed to transport the job from one work centre to 
the next. 
11.3.5		 Creative designs inherent in operations 
Everything that exists started as a design. Good products come from good designs and 
good OM. Conversely, bad products usually originate from bad designs. A good con-
struction business can hardly build a good house if the design is not good. It is difficult 
– or even impossible – to improve faulty designs of products or systems. If the re-engi-
neering of a design is not necessary, the original design was not too bad. OM, therefore, 
includes the science of design. In general, one must design for cost-effectiveness. The 
durability of an acrylic product (such as a custom-made hearing protector) makes it 
much less costly than a disposable foam ear-plug over a short period of time. 
11.3.6		 Principles of OM
Quality ‘chains’ and quality ‘circles’ are concepts that relate to value. A value chain is 
the ideal series of transformational processes whereby each step increases the value of  
an item. OM promotes a systematic approach (eg value analysis) to reducing the cost of 
a product without impairing its quality, value or function. OM also teaches the theory 
of constraints so as to maximise flow rate through bottlenecks and constraints. 
The following OM principles promote value and save time:
•	 Know and team up with the next and final customer. This principle implies breaking 
barriers and building relationships. It refers to the customer as the next process. 
•	 The entire company must become dedicated to continual and rapid improvement in 
quality, cost, response time, flexibility, variability and service. 
•	 The entire company must have a unified purpose via shared information and team 
involvement in the planning and implementation of change. 
•	 Reduce the number of product or service components and operations (processes) 
and the number of suppliers to a few good ones. 
•	 Operation design entails organising resources into multiple chains of customers, 
each focused on a product or service (or ‘customer family’); create workflow teams, 
cells and ‘plants in a plant’. 
•	 Capacity involves utilising human resource potential and creativity by investing 
in human capital (as the internal customer); QWL (‘quality of work-life’) means 
investing in cross-training for mastery of multiple skills. 

Chapter 11: Operations management
197
•	 Capacity entails maintaining and improving present equipment and human capital 
before considering new resources and automating incrementally when process vari-
ability cannot be reduced by other means. 
•	 Process management entails aiming for streamlining and simplicity by making it 
easy to provide goods or services without error or any process variation. 
•	 Cutting flow time (lead-time, waiting time etc), distance and inventory (subassem-
blies and idle work-in-process) along the chains of customers. 
•	 Cutting set-up, changeover, get-ready and start-up lead-times. 
•	 Just-in-time production, or at the customer’s rate of use; decrease cycle intervals and  
lot size. 
•	 Recording and processing one’s own data at the workplace and ensuring that front-line 
improvement teams have the first chance at problem-solving before experts are brought in. 
•	 Cutting administration and reporting; controlling causes, not symptoms. 
11.3.7		 Examples of transformation processes
All operations should be value-adding processes in which inputs are transformed into 
outputs. The single most important input-transforming resource is the human component. 
Human beings act upon transformed resources and are present in all operations. Productivity 
depends directly on human capabilities – competence, qualification and motivation – to 
produce effectively and efficiently. These capabilities must be maintained and sustained. 
QWL (quality of work-life) is one strategy that directly affects operations.
OM also deals with the planning and control of operations. The following table illu-
strates the three areas of OM planning and control.

11.3.8		 OM performance objectives 
Large companies, such as Mercedes, General Electric, McDonalds and Vodacom, are all 
known for service-delivery or other features, such as quality, speed or cost-effective-
ness. These are referred to as performance objectives. The many dimensions of quality 
(such as reliability, consistency, low variability, responsiveness) can also be regarded as 
performance objectives. 
What are the main performance objectives of OM? Besides the quality objective, opera-
tions managers also contribute to business strategy by other means. JIT is associated 
with advantages, such as low lead-times and inventory reductions. This objective is 
integrated with dependability, which can be regarded as a separate performance ob-
jective. Speediness is another performance objective. Flexibility, the ability to be agile, 

Chapter 11: Operations management
199
change and adapt, is another important performance objective. Although productivity 
and efficiency (and their measures) are primarily associated with operations manage-
ment strategy, the strategic operations objective could be low cost and affordability. 
The tenet that ‘there is no such thing as a free lunch’ can be taken as the bottom-line of 
the trade-off theory. Operations managers must consider trading off one aspect of per-
formance against another. This trade-off model of performance has been challenged to 
give the best of both worlds to the market. The best example is the quality versus cost 
trade-off, which has been overcome by many operations even those in the agile supply 
market. The main job of operations managers is to change whatever in the operation is 
causing one performance objective to deteriorate as another improves and the trade-off 
is the mainstay of continuous improvement. 
11.4	 OM IS CENTRAL TO PRODUCTIVITY 
If a small business manufactures a table ineffectively and inefficiently, it has, neverthe-
less, been ‘productive’ in the sense that it actually produced something although the 
output did not fully justify the input. 
Hence, we need measures of productivity, since the operations manager’s key challenge 
will always be to increase the value of output relative to the cost of input. More output 
with the same amount of input increases productivity, but the same level of output 
using less input also increases productivity. 
There are many configurations, but the bottom-line is that sustainable profitability is 
impossible without productivity. This means the output value (usable outputs), after 
being exposed to a uniquely designed transformation process, must be higher than the 
value of the separate pieces of available inputs (resources). 
11.4.1		 Macro-productivity 
Macro-productivity refers to the context of a nation’s entire production. The Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is the measure of the value of the total output of 
a country divided by its total population (seen as the inputs to produce the outputs). 
A national economy is made up of individual businesses and the productivity of the 
country is the sum of the productivity of all its individual operations. A macro-perspec-
tive on productivity management refers to the country/economy as a whole and the 
governance of productivity growth. 
The National Productivity Institute (NPI) offers many suggestions in this regard. 
Examples are infrastructural programmes and investments, a well-functioning 
legal and accounting framework, creating a market-friendly environment, research 

200
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
and technology support, promotion of small and medium enterprises, export trade 
stimulation, education and training policies and a healthy labour market. 
11.4.2		 Micro-productivity 
Micro-productivity refers to an individual business’s operations. It focuses on how well 
operations perform in terms of value, effectiveness, efficiency, utilisation, impact and 
quality. The first measure is the ability to achieve production. Second, productivity is 
measured by means of the following quotient: ‘output divided by input’. 
Productivity measurement defined 
It is imperative to define productivity correctly. Merely saying it is ‘output divided by 
input’ is not the whole story. One can be ‘productive’ without really producing usable 
output. In other words, we can have high efficiency, but low effectiveness. Effectiveness 
is the ‘how good’ or ‘how valuable’ dimension as related to market needs. Productivity 
is, therefore, not only efficiency, but also the quality of inputs, resource utilisation and 
effectiveness. 
These are terms associated with quality management, which is vital for productivity. 
These qualitative improvements in inputs are significant because they create sustain-
ability, durability, stability and cause output to increase without any additional capital 
or human resource inputs. This brings us to a more accurate quotient for productivity: 
Output income (i.e. usable output quantity)
Input expenses (i.e. available input quantity)
 = Productivity (P) 
Productivity is a complex topic because of the different types, dimensions and measures 
of productivity. The ability to achieve production is simply not enough. For instance, 
one may produce things, without having a market to sell them to. An entrepreneur may 
manufacture hundreds of items, without selling many of them. Suddenly, the ability to 
produce has a nasty flavour. 
If there is a market, then the ability to produce for that given market is also not enough. 
This is because the cost of manufacturing may not be viable (cost-effective).
Another nasty surprise! 
Thus, a productive system must have the ability to be effective and efficient. Without 
these elements it would be difficult to make sense of productivity. This means output 
must be effective and efficient. The danger is to focus only on one (eg efficiency) at the 
cost of the other (eg effectiveness).

11.5	 OPERATIONS STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS DESIGN
Any entrepreneur has a broad business strategy. Strategy refers to actions or decisions 
that commit the business to moving in a certain direction or adopting a position in 
the market. Carefully made decisions that help the business to achieve its goals and 
those that have a high impact and particular significance can be regarded as strategies. 
This strategy is based on an operations strategy. Slack et al (1998:77) define operations 
strategy as the total pattern of decisions and actions that formulate the role, objectives 
and activities of each part of the operation so that they contribute to and support the 
organisation’s business strategy.
11.5.1		 Operations design
The operations strategy implies an operations system. Entrepreneurs need to take note 
that their idea, product and/or service range will demand a specific operations design. 
Is it a small factory, a service shop, a job shop, an assembly line or a combination of 
several other types? The product should fit the operations design (the specific market 
need will determine the appropriate operations design, eg lean or agile supply).
The basic differences between a lean and agile operation are summarised in Table 11.3.

The agile supply operation is market-sensitive and can respond nimbly to demand. 
It needs unconventional mechanisms to hear the daily voice of the market and have 
direct access to customer requirements data to create a virtual supply chain that is 
information-based rather than inventory-based. Electronic data interchange enables 
partners in the supply chain to react to the same data (real demand), rather than to the 
distorted picture when orders are transmitted from one to another in the chain. The 
route to sustainable advantage lies in being able to leverage the respective strengths of 
network partners to achieve greater market responsiveness. 
The operations design for very high volume and very low variety is a continuous mode 
of operation. The layout will, therefore, suit a highly mechanised plant. The operations 

202
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
design for a unique functional need, low volume (one item) with high flexibility will 
suit a project mode of operation. The layout is temporary, with no clear flow lines and 
because the product position is fixed, the layout is referred to as a fixed-position layout. 
The same three dimensions (variety, volume and product scope) are used to come up 
with a job mode of operations design – batch-operation design or repetitive-operation 
design. 
Product design will determine process type (intermittent or continuous), as well as lay-
out and flow of work. The entire network of micro and macro-processes will consist of 
the basic flow (and layout type), the technologies used (process technologies, equip-
ment and machines) and job design. Process design is not merely an assembly line. 
It may also include network decisions pertaining to suppliers if the business is back-
wardly integrated into the supply chain and decisions relating to the capacity level of 
each operation in the supply network. 
Each operation in the network will select a process type based on the variety–volume 
characteristics of the operation. Small variety and large quantities will dictate a specific 
process type. Process type, on the other hand, will dictate layout type, although process 
type and layout type are not always totally deterministic. In general, the OM function 
has three important strategic roles (Slack et al, 1998:45), namely:
•	 the operations function as implementer of business strategy 
•	 the operations function as driver of business strategy 
•	 the operations function as a support to business strategy. 
11.5.2		 Types of productive systems and their characteristics 
All transformation systems convert inputs into outputs. All of these operations share 
the same operations management model, principles and performance objectives. These 
systems are also referred to as transforming resources that convert a combination of 
inputs – referred to as transformed resources (Slack et al, 1998). They are designed for 
the particular demand which will determine the system’s dimensions, nature, scope 
and scale. This leads to different operations system designs, such as service shops, job 
shops, production lines, batch operations, mass services, projects and other combina-
tions, as compared in Table 11.4.
11.5.3		 Relationship between operation system type and layout type
Decisions concerning the layout type will not merely depend on choosing between the 
basic layout types, but also on understanding the advantages and disadvantages of the 
different types, or combinations, of layouts. The flow of transformed resources will be 
determined by both the feasibility and importance of the degree of regular flow. The 
opposite of this is high variety (when regular flow is difficult) and low volume (when 

Chapter 11: Operations management
203
regular flow is not feasible). The relationship between basic processes (or operations 
systems) and basic layout types are:
•	 projects and large jobs = Fixed-position layout
•	 jobs and batch processes = Process layout (layout according to similar processes) 
•	 large batches and small continuous processes = Cell layout 
•	 mass processes or pure continuous repetitive processes = Product layout (layout 
according to the product).

The layout of the productive unit, therefore, only governs the general configuration of 
facilities. Mode shifting is also possible after process re-engineering. This means the 
mode of operations system design (and layout type) may change from job to project or 
from batch to continuous (from custom to commodity). The purpose of effective layout 

204
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
is to streamline work flow by minimising handling distance and increasing facility 
utilisation. 
11.6	 OPERATIONS PLANNING AND CONTROL 
Planning is about ‘who’, ‘what’, ‘when’, ‘how’ and ‘where’. 
Operations planning is governed by OM policy, defined as a set of guidelines for execution 
and control, as based on the operations strategy, which determines the prescribed, accepted 
actions within the operations function in order to achieve continuity, consistency and 
integration.    
The result is that the operations manager’s decisions are focused, thereby consistent 
with planning done by the business and that the operations function contributes to the 
creation of a competitive base. 
Long-term planning involves factors such as fixed-capacity planning (eg deciding on 
the location and layout of a factory) and product planning (which incorporates product 
development and aggregate forecasting). These activities have a strategic element and 
decisions flowing from them would affect the operations system in the long term. 
Medium to short-term planning involves factors such as aggregate or variable capacity 
planning, item forecasting, master scheduling, operations scheduling and inventory ma- 
nagement. The activities of medium-term planning are based on the decisions taken 
during long-term planning, since these – to some extent – determine the parameters 
within which the medium-term planning will be done. Furthermore, the operations 
manager organises the operations function by allocating responsibilities and creating 
structures (eg arranging departments and sections, as well as setting up chains of au-
thority). This function also includes the creation of supplier networks. 
Leadership involves motivating the workers within the operations function. A new 
development in the field of operations management is the focus on the human aspects 
of the transformation process. 
Finally, the operations manager is responsible for control over the transformation 
process. This function includes all the steps taken to set standards and to evaluate the 
operations system against these standards. Some of the control functions exercised by 
the operations manager include quantity control (the measurement of productivity), 
quality control and cost control. 
Aggregate planning refers to the anticipation of aggregate demand in broad terms and 
encompasses capacity planning. It is a broad view of the market and what an opera-
tion can handle in capacity terms. Master scheduling follows aggregate planning and 
D

Chapter 11: Operations management
205
results in a Master Production Schedule (MPS) statement as the main input to Materials 
Requirements Planning (MRP). 
11.6.1		 The specific objectives of demand management and demand 
	
	 management activities
•	 Long-term objectives: The long-term objective of demand management relates to 
fixed capacity planning. 
•	 Medium-term objectives: In the medium term, demand management is used to 
determine aggregate demand. Normally, this is the demand for a group of products 
sharing the same capacity in the plant. Aggregate demand is utilised for adjustable 
capacity planning. 
Forecasting can be defined as determining the demand for a product produced by the 
business, but with a view to accommodating future events.     
Recording orders is another important component of demand management. The delivery  
promise can only be made once the order has been positioned in the master schedule, 
which in turn is dependent on the availability of finished product, assemblies and com-
ponents. 
11.6.2		 Categories of forecasting 
Broadly speaking, forecasting techniques are divided into three categories.
•	 First, there are qualitative techniques based mainly on judgement. Although data 
are used in these techniques, the forecast is done on the grounds of the forecaster’s 
feelings about the data, rather than actual calculations. 
•	 The second category is known as time–series analysis, which is quantitative. In this 
category, the data are manipulated mathematically in order to arrive at a forecast of 
the subsequent period(s). 
•	 The last category comprises the so-called ‘causal methods’. The purpose of these 
forecasting techniques is to determine a cause-and-effect relationship. This is usually 
done by means of a mathematical expression or model. 
Multi-period pattern projections 
The time–series technique produces forecasts for more than one future period (be it a 
week, month or quarter). For example, the average of a number of monthly data points 
can be taken and used as a forecast for the next six months. The basic assumption is that 
no trend or seasonal component is present in the demand pattern. 
D

206
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
Single-period patternless projections 
This kind of forecasting technique also makes use of historical data, but the forecast 
is for the next (single) period only. The historical data usually reflect the most recent 
demand quantities. 
Capacity refers to the limited means of a productive unit to manufacture a certain 
quantity of products within a particular fixed period. OM may refer to capacity 
planning, as planning for adjustable (variable) resources, such as labour and aggregate 
inventory, over the medium term. It should also refer to fixed (non-adjustable) resources. 
Capacity control refers to the loading of resources and keeping work centres busy, but 
not overloaded. 
Planning for future production capacity occurs in the following three stages:
•	 demand forecasting 
•	 attuning the capacity of various machines/resources/facilities 
•	 determining strategies for the full utilisation of capacity. 
11.6.3		 The ‘Ms’ of capacity 
Business capacity is the greatest workload (or input) that a business can handle (trans-
formation to output). The ‘Ms’ are used to describe the limits of any operation. These 
are methods, machines, money, material, manpower (including management). 
Capacity is made up of combinations of the Ms and the optimisation of capacity is 
important to maximise production ability. Factors such as the learning curve have an 
impact on capacity. Trained and experienced manpower affects the rest of the capacity 
configuration in the sense that it determines how the other Ms are utilised. 
11.6.4		 Fixed-capacity planning 
Fixed-capacity planning is the first long-term question facing OM. This planning must 
be done thoroughly in order to place the productive unit on a firm footing from the 
start. In this context, the term ‘productive unit’ means the factory, office, bank, shop, or 
similar institution in which goods and/or services are manufactured or provided. The 
elements of fixed-capacity planning are:
•	 occupational safety 
•	 identifying a suitable location 
•	 determining the size of the productive unit 
•	 the layout of the productive unit 
•	 the choice and design of, and specifications for, machinery and equipment. 

Chapter 11: Operations management
207
11.6.5		 Adapting capacity to a change in demand 
The following strategies can be used to make full use of production capacity. 
An operations unit consisting of a single experienced joiner can assemble 12 coffee 
tables per week. Demand increases to 20 tables. The business should, therefore, consider 
appointing another joiner. The productive unit can consider the following strategies if 
its capacity is too small to satisfy demand for the product:
•	 It could opt for differentiation of the product. 
•	 It could also consider increasing capacity by acquiring additional fixed assets. 
•	 The business could introduce overtime. 
•	 An additional shift could be introduced. This, too, is a relatively cheap alternative, 
because the fixed costs have already been covered.
•	 Temporary means of production can be used. This phenomenon is often found in the 
case of seasonal productive units, such as hotels that employ additional staff during 
busy periods.
•	 Divisions experiencing a shortage of capacity could generate that capacity by a 
transfer of surplus capacity from other divisions.
•	 Specialisation of product can be considered if there are too many types of products 
and/or services.
•	 Additional machines could be obtained.
Assume a sub-assembly of the TRAPSIX golf cart needs to move through three machines 
in the production process, as in Table 11.5.
Table 11.5:  Example of an assembly process

The machine with the smallest capacity (E) will limit the capacity of the entire process. 
Machine D has surplus capacity and more machines may be required (given that 
demand is higher than capacity). Calculate the smallest value into which each of 
the three capacity figures (60, 20 and 30) can be divided and determine how many 
additional machines are required (see Table 11.6 on the next page).

The productive unit can consider the following strategies if capacity is greater than 
demand:
•	 Worker numbers can be scaled down or even phased out.
•	 The unit can work fewer shifts. 
•	 Integration of product is an effective strategy at management’s disposal. 
•	 Management may decide to close a section of the factory and lay off some of the 
workers. 
•	 The business can decide to phase out the temporary means of production. 
•	 The business can move surplus capacity that was brought in from another depart-
ment back to the original department. 
Schedules are statements of volume and timing in different types of operations. Ope-
rations scheduling refers to the determination of the quantity of jobs and sequence in 
which jobs and activities are to be completed in the manufacturing plant. The schedu-
ling activity is one of the most complex functions of OM because of the following vari-
ables: schedulers must deal with different types of capacity/resources simultaneously, 
machines and staff will have different capabilities and the number of possible schedules 
increases as the number of activities and processes increases. 
11.6.6		 The activities of operations scheduling 
Scheduling is a very important skill inherent to OM and is regarded as an art. Schedules 
change frequently and need to match demand and capacity on a continuous basis. 
The aggregate plan for a business indicates what final products the business plans to 
manufacture. CARmats (Pty) Ltd, for example primarily produces 4 000 anti-rubber 
TPE mats per year, consisting of 2 500 small car trunks and 1 500 SUV liners. The MPS 
is a disaggregated plan and usually indicates the different product models and planned 
production per time interval (eg per month). 

Chapter 11: Operations management
209
The basic activity of scheduling is the pushing, pulling, routing, sizing and timing of work 
through work centres. Push and pull control refers to the system that triggers the work. 
MRP, for instance, pushes out the work without considering the exact time or use of the 
customer, while in a pull system, the pace is determined by the customer as the next process. 
Operations scheduling comprises four distinct activities. First, the operations must be 
timed and routed. Timing involves making a decision about when a particular operation 
will take place and routing is done to establish the place where, or on which piece of 
equipment, the operation will be performed. 
The second activity is known as dispatching. This involves issuing a shop order so that 
the operation can take place. 
The third activity concerns control or establishing the status of the shop order. This is 
necessary, since the progress of the shop order must be known at all times. If necessary, 
a shop order may have to be expected so as not to delay the delivery of the final product, 
or to minimise the lateness on an order. 
Expediting is the fourth activity of operations scheduling. 
Effective scheduling
•	 provides a realistic schedule and allows for any essential changes 
•	 allows enough time for all the operations (the time before, during and after 
operations) 
•	 does not release all available jobs by means of shop orders 
•	 does not schedule all the available capacity of the plant 
•	 assigns responsibility for keeping to schedules to the workers or operators. 
Apart from the fact that scheduling is much easier in a continuous or repetitive manu-
facturing situation, the success of the so-called ‘process operations’ also depends on a 
number of other factors. These factors are:
•	 avoiding quality problems where possible and assuring reliability of suppliers 
•	 monitoring the process and product design 
•	 rigorous preventive maintenance
•	 optimal mixes and rapid changeover 
•	 regular schedules and linear output. 
NB

210
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
Undercapacity scheduling means that less than the total available capacity is scheduled, 
for example 95% of available capacity for a particular shift. This means that the required 
output for the shift is only 95% of what could be produced at full capacity. 
The nature of scheduling will depend on the type of operations system (eg make-to-
stock, resource-to-order or make-to-order). The planning and control therefore differ for 
each product or operation. Low-volume operations have more speculation because of 
the different variables in the throughput process. For high volume make-to-stock ope- 
rations, the demand time is very short compared to the total throughput cycle. 
11.6.7		 Forward and backward scheduling 
The point of departure used in scheduling has a critical influence on the scheduling 
itself. The first approach is to begin at the present and to schedule forward, according to 
the times needed to complete all the operations necessary to complete the order. When 
all times have been added, the manufacturer can give the customer an indication of 
when the order will be ready. This approach is known as forward scheduling. 
On the other hand, in backward scheduling, the required time as prescribed by the 
customer can be used as a starting point so that the time for each activity is subtracted 
from the due date (see question 13 in the Self-evaluation questions section). 
11.6.8		 Gantt charts and other techniques
Gantt charts (time charts) are the most commonly-used scheduling technique. They are 
simple to construct and easy to understand. Gantt charts give a visual impression of the 
progress made on the project or sub-project. The work packages of the job/project with 
its work package descriptors (tasks or activities) are on the left-hand side and the work 
duration at the bottom. 
Another technique that can be applied to schedule any number of jobs on two or three 
machines is known as Johnson’s algorithm. The algorithm ensures that the optimal 
sequence is found – that is, the sequence which will minimise the total processing  
time. Johnson’s algorithm has as its point of departure the existence of a fixed sequence 
according to which the job moves through the work centres or machines. 
The very simple Johnson’s algorithm (also referred to as the Johnson’s rule) is a good 
example of how powerful an OM technique can be. This algorithm is widely used in 
small job shops, where volume is low and variety is high. Determining the optimal 
processing sequence (that is which job follows which), as opposed to scheduling 
work on a random ‘thumb-suck’ or first-come-first-served basis, can save operations 
managers a great deal of time and other resources. 
In the following figure, jobs are extruded, then printed and finally cut.

Following the steps (not explained here) of the algorithm, the optimal sequence is:  
S ➝ R ➝ P ➝ Q ➝ T with a total processing time (determined on a Gantt chart) of 41 
hours. TRAPSIX (Pty) Ltd can, this way, optimise their time per job and gain additional 
capacity. If the sequence is randomly determined by ‘thumb-suck’, it will be found 
that there is an error margin of six to ten hours. A manager, therefore, who plans to 
do five jobs on this thumb-suck basis in a 42-hour week, will not succeed. In fact, the  
P ➝ Q ➝ R ➝ S ➝ T sequence will take 49 hours. Managers who do not use this 
technique will tend to lose up to 10 hours per week × 40 booked work weeks = 400 
hours/eight-hour work days = ±50 days.
Applying this simple algorithm can, therefore, save a considerable amount of time, thus 
creating spare capacity.
11.6.9		 Inventory management
Inventory management is the function of planning and controlling all types of inven-
tory (raw materials, sub-assemblies, consumables, finished products etc). Inventory 
management is crucial, since capital must be tied up in other investments and not in 
idle stock. The inventory function has several interfaces with purchasing, warehousing, 
marketing and OM.
The essence of inventory management is to have just enough inventory at any given 
time. This implies two major dimensions, namely timing of inventory and quantity 
determination. Several techniques exist for timing and quantity determination.
The mode of operation will determine the type of timing and quantity planning and 
control. Resource-to-order (project operations) will keep no stock. Make-to-order (eg 
job shops) will hold the minimum inventory and will obtain inventory according to 
the custom order by the client. Make-to-stock (eg batch and repetitive operations) will 
do planning and control based on forecasting, safety stock levels and economic order 
quantities.

Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
Control must be exercised over the financial investment in inventory, thereby saving 
on interest and cost. Keeping inventory goes hand in hand with certain cost factors, 
such as obsolescence, interest on capital investment, physical wear and tear, damages, 
transportation and insurance. If inventory control does not enjoy management’s full 
attention, these cost factors can take on serious proportions. 
The objectives of inventory management are as follows:
•	 A scientific, factual method to simplify purchases (by using mathematical models) 
needs to be created. 
•	 There should be a reduction in possible losses as a result of obsolescence and incorrect 
or excessive purchases. Good inventory control turnover rates are necessary. 
•	 Dead or slow-moving stock should be identified. 
•	 Inventory control must serve as a source of information for management decisions. 
•	 Losses should be prevented by controlling all incoming inventory as regards 
quality, quantity and the requirements as determined in the purchase order. This is 
important since it impacts directly on the quality of the finished product. 
•	 Excessive variety should be avoided. The advantages of standardisation and 
simplification must be considered. 
•	 Production should never be delayed because of a shortage of a certain inventory 
item. Such delays make an extremely bad impression on the customer. 
•	 Ordering the most economical quantities through an effective control system is essential. 
•	 All internal customers (the next process) and external customers should be given 
good service. 
Carrying cost 
Inventory ties up capital and is referred to as ‘carrying cost’. There are several inventory 
carrying cost elements. Total carrying cost usually includes the following and may be 
direct or indirect.
•	 Direct inventory carrying cost elements: The two direct-cost components are capi-
tal cost (interest or opportunity cost) and holding cost. Holding cost refers to the 
cost involved in renting storage facilities, warehouse equipment, electricity, insu-
rance, security, handling, bookkeeping, warehousing labour and damage. 
Note in the example below, I = the annual carrying cost rate, which is based on the 
direct inventory carrying cost elements, namely capital cost and holding cost.
•	 Indirect inventory carrying cost elements: These are the costs attached to obso-
lescence, record-keeping, physical stocktaking, inventory planning and control by 

Chapter 11: Operations management
213
management. Other hidden cost elements are the cost of production floor space 
utilised for work in process, scrap and rework, as well as the cost involved in 
handling and containerisation. 
The entrepreneurs of custom-made hearing protection devices in South Africa need to 
be flexible and adaptable to the high demand of quality ear plugs. Assume it would cost  
R2 750 to rearrange the Noise Clipper (Pty) Ltd laboratory facilities inside one of their work 
centres in order to eliminate R5 500 worth of inventory. If I = 0,25, will the rearrangement 
be worth it? 
This is a saving of 0,25 x R5 500 per year (i.e. R1 375 per year), which means that the  
R2 750 will be recovered within two years. Hence, this would be worth considering.   
Order cost 
Order cost can be defined as the cost which must be incurred to place an order. An item may 
be ordered twice, three times or more per year – and even daily in JIT systems. If orders are 
placed only twice a year, such orders will, therefore make up 50% of the annual demand. 
If these orders are to be manufactured internally, the cost will consist mainly of machinery 
set-ups.    
Inventory timing by means of the reorder point (ROP) 
Inventory timing by means of the ROP can be regarded as the traditional model. This 
technique is as old as manufacturing itself. However, it is still a popular method and is 
found, for example in every household. A reorder point refers to a certain level of stocks 
at which the stock must be replenished or reordered. 
There are variations of ROP. The periodic inventory system is used by restaurants, 
service stations and other retailers, where inventory is ordered daily or weekly. The 
two-bin system is also a continuous inventory system often used in small warehouses. 
As soon as one bin is empty, an order is placed. 
ROPs are calculated according to experience of consumer patterns, rule-of-thumb 
judgement, or by applying a formula. However, the formula also demands a degree of 
judgement, since it incorporates safety stock and demand patterns. 
The ROP formula is: 
ROP = D(LT) + SS 
where ROP 	
	
= 	
reorder point 
D 	
	
	
= 	
average demand per time period 
LT 	
	
	
= 	
average lead-time 
D(LT) 	 	
	
= 	
average demand during lead-time 
SS 	
	
	
= 	
safety stock 
Do

Noise Clipper’s laboratory’s average monthly demand for Mr.cl-EAR cleaning spray for 
occupational hygiene is 105 litres. If the order lead-time is one week and a safety stock of 
five litres is applicable, what will the ROP be? 
ROP 	
= 	
D(LT) + SS, in other words 
ROP 	
= 	
105(7/30) + (105/30)5 
	
= 	
24.5 + 17.5 
	
= 	
42 litres of Mr.cl-EAR cleaning spray (this level signals a new order).    
11.6.10  Material requirements planning 
Material requirements planning (MRP) plans for various periods in the future and is 
also referred to as a ‘push system’. An MRP computer run enables operations managers 
to answer questions, such as: a master schedule for three sizes of screwdriver indicates 
that all three screwdrivers (size 2 mm, size 7 mm and size 5 cm) use the same handle. 
The item master file shows the planning factors, such as batch order quantities of 20, a 
safety stock level of two handles, available inventory of 70 and the lead-time for orders 
of two weeks. In this way, MRP assists OM managers to establish when orders will be 
issued and what the planned orders will be. MRP can be complicated and is computer-
based.
11.6.11  Determining inventory quantities 
The lot-for-lot approach 
The easiest way is to make the batch size equal to net requirements. Only the quantity 
required for the parent item is bought or manufactured. There is no batching in larger 
batches. Orders must, therefore, be placed frequently, which results in high order costs 
or set-up costs. 
The EOQ formula 
The Economic Ordering Quantity (EOQ) model is one of the oldest models, having  
been developed by F.W. Harris in 1915. Although the assumptions are not always 
applicable in practice, they are still usually close enough to make the model useful. 
11.6.12  Break-even analysis 
This is a technique for determining the volume at which total revenues are equal to total 
cost or when the cost to make equals the total cost to buy. One can use this in a make-
Do

Chapter 11: Operations management
215
or-buy decision, or when two production methods are compared. It may also be used 
to determine the profit potential of a new product. 
The Fairy Dale Hospital in Buffalo Bay, Knysna, considers a new procedure to be offered at 
R200 per patient. The fixed cost (portion of the total cost that remains constant regardless 
of changes in levels of output) is R100 000 per year. The variable cost (the portion of the 
total cost that varies directly with volume of output) is R100 per patient. What is the break-
even quantity for this service? 
Answer: 
One can use the algebraic or graphic approaches. For the hospital to break even, the number 
of patients (Q) in Buffalo Bay must equal the fixed cost per year (F) divided by the unit profit 
margin (price (P) minus cost (C)). This gives us the following formula for the break-even 
number of patients: 
Q = 
F
P – C  =  100 000
200 – 100  = 1 000 patients 
Consequently, if demand is less than 1 000 patients, the procedure should not be considered. 
Break-even case study using the algebraic approach 
CARmats (Pty) Ltd has developed and patented a new anti-rubber vehicle liner (trunk). 
Before trying to commercialise the mats and add it to their existing product line, they wish 
to get an idea of the possible success by determining the minimum break-even demand or 
volume. 
The fixed cost is R56 000 per year, the variable cost per unit is R7 and the selling price is 
set at R25. Expected initial demand is ±415 units per month. Use the formula to calculate 
the break-even quantity (Q). 
The answer is Q = 3 111 units per year. It will therefore be worthwhile to proceed with  
the device.
11.7	 OPERATIONS IMPROVEMENT 
Leadership is an important part of quality. True entrepreneurs have an innate passion 
for quality and they lead by their own example and influential power. However, they 
do need to take cognisance of a few important issues, namely:
•	 effective and constant communication 
•	 creating the right attitude and motivation for employees to serve the customers to 
the best of their ability 
Do
eg

216
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
•	 identifying and developing the abilities of employees so that they can contribute in 
the areas in which they are operationally active 
•	 helping employees to understand the basics of sound management. 
A good leader has the ability to see the big picture, strengthen the vision and then inspire 
employees to strive for its realisation. Leaders have a big impact on the culture of the 
organisation. Leadership hinges on vision, strategy and people empowerment. Management 
by fear is a sign of leadership inadequacy.   
Leadership determines the components of the quality culture. These non-tangible 
components are:
•	 behaviour 
•	 norms 
•	 dominant values 
•	 rules of the game for getting on 
•	 climate. 
11.7.1		 Never-ending improvement through total quality 
	
	 management 
The three main reasons why total quality management (TQM) should be adopted by 
OM managers is that it is intuitively attractive; second, the principles of TQM make 
sense unconventionally; and third, a TQM approach to management can dramatically 
increase operational effectiveness. 
TQM is primarily concerned with the improvement of all aspects of operations 
performance; it is a holistic approach to quality. 
The TQM approach is far more than quality assurance (QA) or the detection mode 
of quality control. It is an approach to improving the ‘smartness’, competitiveness, 
flexibility and effectiveness of the entire organisation. It also removes the burden 
of wasted effort from people’s lives by bringing everyone into the processes of 
improvement so that results are achieved in less time (Oakland, 2003:19). 
Total quality management is a holistic approach to quality 
Quality is a need of both the internal customer (the organisation and the operation) and 
the external customer. Quality matters to external customers because they want:
•	 to be respected and do not want any hassles 
D

Chapter 11: Operations management
217
•	 a product and service that are value for money 
•	 a product and service that are reliable and meet all their requirements 
•	 a product and service that are available on time 
•	 a product and service that improve their quality of life. 
The main reason and justification for quality is the fact that it is absent in people’s lives  
and we consequently seek measures to restore it. One way to obtain quality is by closing  
quality gaps and applying TQM. Quality management is, therefore, not only relevant in 
business, but also in the following seven areas:
1.	 quality of product 
2.	 quality of service 
3.	 quality of organisation 
4.	 quality of processes 
5.	 quality of work-life 
6.	 quality of life 
7.	 quality of being. 
Quality of product can be defined as:
•	 conformance to the purchase order 
•	 fitness for the intended function 
•	 the degree to which the client or customer is satisfied 
•	 a total composite of product and service dimensions that meets the customer’s 
expectations. 
Holistic quality refers to a product or service condition with multiple quality character-
istics, one that is also managed, obtained or realised in a holistic way namely, by TQM. 
Holistic quality:
•	 is not only a beautiful product 
•	 does not only happen on the production floor 
•	 is not merely inspection 
•	 is not only about improvement techniques 
•	 does not only prevent injuries/errors. 

218
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
The word ‘total’ in the term ‘total quality management’ refers to quality’s roots and its 
end. Quality cannot, therefore, be left to chance. It has to be managed and this becomes 
everybody’s responsibility, not just that of the so-called ‘quality department’. 
Observe the following examples of definitions of TQM:
•	 TQM comprises actions needed to obtain world-class quality. 
•	 TQM is the organisation-wide prevention of wastage, defects and injuries and its 
continuous improvement of quality.
•	 TQM is a comprehensive, uninterrupted programme to ensure quality throughout the 
organisation by placing the responsibility for it at source.   
The overview of what quality is shows us that it is not easy to define and that it is often 
in the eye of the beholder. What do people look for when they consider the quality of a 
product or service? The best way is to use different quality dimensions. 
Examples of quality dimensions pertaining to services are:
•	 Reliability means that one can depend on a service dimension as expected. 
•	 Responsiveness is the willingness of the service provider to meet the customers’ 
needs when these needs are expressed. 
•	 Competence refers to the service providers’ possession of skills and knowledge to 
perform the service. 
The following attributes relate specifically to goods: 
•	 Performance is the way that a product actually operates. Does it do what it promises 
to do? 
•	 Features are the little extras that go with a product and make it unique. 
•	 Reliability refers to the promise that it will perform and keep on performing as pro-
mised over a specific time span (eg the guarantee period). 
•	 Conformance is the meeting of pre-set standards. 
•	 Durability is the length of the useful life of the product – its life span. 
•	 Aesthetics – the physical quality of the product, which makes it pleasant to look at. 
•	 Perceived quality is the indirect evaluation of quality, for example the reputation of 
a specific brand.

11.7.2		 Maintenance and replacement 
Machinery and equipment are subject to a substantial degree of wear because their 
moving parts are in constant use. Machinery and equipment operating in dusty condi-
tions are inclined to wear more quickly and require more maintenance. 
The consequences of defective machinery and equipment are:
•	 Reduced production capacity. Machinery and equipment failures mean that no 
production can take place and this leads to a reduction in capacity. 
•	 Increased production costs. Failures in machinery and equipment result in a higher 
hourly cost. Machine operators are idle while the machinery and equipment are 
being repaired. Moreover, the salaries and wages of the maintenance teams, as well 
as the cost of replacing the broken components, have to be discounted. Sometimes, 
back-up machinery must be hired or purchased, which also means extra cost. 
•	 Lower-quality products and services. 
•	 Threats to safety. 
•	 Customer dissatisfaction. 
Mixed maintenance strategies are adopted according to circumstances. Usually they 
are a combination of breakdown maintenance, condition-based and preventive mainte-
nance. These types may also be categorised as follows:
•	 corrective maintenance 
•	 preventive maintenance 
•	 centralised maintenance 
•	 decentralised maintenance 
•	 sub-contracted maintenance. 
11.7.2.1  Preventive maintenance 
The following programme can be instituted to ensure effective preventive maintenance:
•	 Training of maintenance teams. The members of the maintenance teams must be 
properly trained so that any possible failure can be dealt with effectively. 
•	 Determining/predicting the possible time of failure. The possible time of failure of 
the machinery and equipment should be scientifically determined. Proper records 
must be kept of the intervals between failures of the relevant components so that 
their average life span can be calculated. 

220
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
•	 Implementing Japanese principles. The Japanese preventive maintenance pro-
grammes are based on the principle that workers accept responsibility for prevent-
ing possible failures. 
The business must, at all times, try to minimise the maintenance cost. This can only 
be done by creating a proper balance between corrective maintenance and preventive 
maintenance. 
Preventive maintenance becomes more expensive than corrective maintenance as the 
amount of maintenance increases. Preventive maintenance can, therefore, only be justi-
fied if either of the following two conditions occurs:
•	 when the possible machine failure can be predicted with a fair measure of accuracy, 
so that the machine can be repaired before it fails 
•	 when the time spent on preventive maintenance is less than it would take to repair 
a machine which has already failed. 
11.7.2.2  Total productive maintenance and improvement 
Maintenance should never be seen as an isolated activity. It is part of a continuous im-
provement programme, since maintenance should lead to improvements. Maintenance 
strategy should be seen as part of TQM and total productive maintenance and as a 
mechanism to identify improvement opportunities. 
This drive to maintain and sustain assets, equipment and resources has many hidden 
advantages. Besides improved operations, it cultivates pride and leads to other smaller 
initiatives (eg new methods and process technologies). Maintenance should never 
be only corrective or reactive. Improvements should be sought to minimise reactive 
and corrective maintenance. Preventive maintenance (as part of TPM) must always be 
improved and made part of all maintenance strategies within the organisation. 
11.7.3		 Safety, health and environmental management 
OM is not only a quantitative subject, but also has a humanitarian side, since many 
operational solutions lie in employee motivation and well-being. 
Unfortunately, many entrepreneurs are more concerned to get the business going 
initially than to worry about health and safety. This oversight can be detrimental; even 
large mining organisations tend to neglect health and safety. 

Chapter 11: Operations management
221
Today, the role of OM is definitely moving increasingly towards safety, health and 
environment (SHE) management. A case in point is the new focus on the well-being of 
the ‘internal customer’. Workplace health promotion is a strategic issue. The changing 
role of operations managers includes a new paradigm towards labour and work. Their 
challenge to create and sustain a workplace of health and safety excellence is increasing 
and there is a culture shift towards the philosophy of work and productivity within 
a SHE culture. Total quality management (TQM) is regarded as the vehicle to obtain 
organisational and business excellence. 
Everyone should enjoy work and everyone can be a champion. A few quality principles 
can make a big difference, and a small positive change anywhere can have a positive 
effect everywhere. 
11.7.3.1  Process technology improves health and safety 
Any device that improves ergonomics or that can assist the value-adding process may 
be regarded as process technology. Besides robots, mobile phones and fax machines, a 
wide variety of technology is available to fulfil operational objectives. 
Small things such as a scanner, machine tools and personal protective equipment can 
make a huge difference. The filtering of harmful amplitudes of noise by means of 
hearing protection devices not only protects hearing, but also improves localisation, 
comfort, speech discrimination and so forth. 
The concern for health and safety should be informed by the conviction that safety is 
a matter of life and death. The sum total of all contributions (systems, strategies and 
behaviours) determines safety. This holistic view of safety is important and should 
come from an internal sense of moral obligation rooted in values and not only be driven 
by regulatory pressures. The majority (80%) of injuries at work are attributable to the 
unsafe acts of people, while unsafe conditions account for the rest of injuries. 
11.7.3.2  Good housekeeping 
Good housekeeping helps prevent incidents, just as cleanliness helps cut down on 
germs. A clean, orderly workplace will help workers in many instances. It helps to 
make workplaces more pleasant, makes workers feel better about their work, and pre-
vents accidents. Treating a work area with respect will help avoid slips, trips, falls and 
bumps. 
The following basic principles are part of good housekeeping:
•	 wipe up accidental spills without delay 
•	 stack materials (and other means) neatly 

222
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
•	 keep cabinet doors and drawers closed 
•	 return equipment and tools to their proper place after use 
•	 dispose of waste or trash promptly (including flammable liquids, oily and paint-
covered rags and paper). 
11.8	 SUMMARY 
This chapter has introduced the comprehensive OM body of knowledge. The dynamics 
of OM and the inherent importance of creativity introduced the chapter and the typical 
OM principles were listed. OM and process management were defined and the OM 
performance objectives discussed. It has been shown how productivity relates to OM 
and section 11.5 dealt with operations strategy and design. This was followed by 
operations planning and control. Operations improvement covered the popular themes 
of quality, TQM and SHE management.

The human
resource function

Chapter
12.1 LEARNING OUTCOMES 
After you have studied this chapter, you should be able to:  
• draw up a job description for a post 
• describe the process for employing staff 
• compile an orientation programme for newcomers 
• draw up a framework for a training programme 
• explain the concept of human resource maintenance.     
12.2 INTRODUCTION 
The human resource (or personnel) function is one of the functions of a business. It 
differs from the other functions in the sense that the tasks and activities related to 
personnel also form part of all the other functions of the business. Each individual, 
who has authority over other employees, from top management to supervisory level, is 
involved in personnel work to a certain degree. 
Most businesses operate on a continuous basis. This means that they do not exist for 
a few months and then stop their business. They usually plan to be in business for a 
longer period of time. As time goes by, businesses grow and their employees resign, 
get promoted and some die. Those lost have to be replaced to enable the business to 
continue with its business as before. Just like the heart supplies your body with blood 
to enable it to live, the human resource function supplies the business with people 
to enable it to do business continuously. One of the primary objectives of the human 
resource manager is to ensure that a business employs the right number and type of 
employees at the required time. 
To achieve this, the human resource manager must carry out the following functions:
• human resource planning (the process of ensuring that the business has the right 
skills at the right time) 
• recruitment (to seek and fi nd potential employees) 

228
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
•	 selection (to choose the most suitable person for a specific post) 
•	 placement (when the employee is placed in the post) 
•	 orientation (whereby the new employee is introduced to the business, its procedures, 
the work environment and to all the other employees). 
The human resource function is also a critical component of personnel well-being. The 
human resource manager is responsible for the best utilisation and maintenance of 
labour as a production factor in the business. This includes the training, development 
and maintenance (including remuneration, labour relations, personnel administration 
and working conditions) of personnel. 
Even though all businesses are not the same size, ranging from one-man concerns and 
small partnerships to large companies, there are always human resource activities to 
be carried out and managed. This does not mean, however, that each business has a 
separate human resource division. A small business (for example, with fewer than 20 
employees) is unlikely to have a separate human resource division. In such a case, the 
owner or manager will normally decide how the human resource function will be man-
aged. There are many different options such as:
•	 one person may be appointed to handle all the human resource tasks 
•	 one person may be appointed to handle all the human resource tasks in conjunction 
with another function, such as the financial function 
•	 the manager could handle it him- or herself 
•	 the manager could make use of temporary employees 
•	 the manager could outsource the human resource function (i.e. making use of an 
external company to manage it). 
In larger businesses it is not possible for the owner and line managers to handle all 
staff matters effectively themselves. They need expertise and assistance and a human 
resource division is usually established. 
The head of the human resource function has various designations, including ‘personnel 
director’, ‘personnel manager’, ‘manpower manager’ or ‘human resource manager’. 
The latter term is currently used by most businesses. 
12.3	 PROVISION OF HUMAN RESOURCES 
12.3.1		 Human resource planning 
As mentioned, a business needs to employ new staff members at various times. There 
are various reasons for employing new people. These could include people who resign, 

Chapter 12: The human resource function
229
the business expands and grows, and new technologies are introduced. In order to 
employ new members, the human resource manager must first determine what type of 
people and how many are needed for the business to expand or continue productively. 
Information regarding the vacant positions must be obtained. The process of gathering 
information is called a job analysis. This information is then used to compile a job 
description and job specification. 
First, all the information relevant to the position needs to be collected. This can be done 
through observation, interviews and questionnaires. 
Second, the information is divided into a job description and a job specification. The job 
description describes the duties, relationships of authority and responsibilities of the 
person in a specific job. The job specification contains the details of the requirements 
that the person needs to be able to do a specific job. 
The following is an example of the owner of a small clothes business, who cannot cope 
with the amount of work by himself anymore. He decides to get assistance, but is not 
sure exactly what type of people he needs and how many. 
He starts by doing a job analysis, i.e. collecting all the important data about the work. He 
makes a list of all the tasks that must be performed in the business. Then he groups all the 
tasks that logically belong together and that can be done by one person, such as the tasks 
to do with money, income and expenditure. Such a combination of tasks can become one 
person’s job. 
List of tasks:
1.	 Conduct market research to determine what sizes, types and quantities of clothing to be 
purchased 
2.	 Purchase stock 
3.	 Exhibit clothes 
4.	 Maintain stock at optimum levels 
5.	 Sell the clothes 
6.	 Keep record of accounts 
7.	 Keep the books up to date 
8.	 Calculate ordering and stock quantities 
9.	 Market the department 
10.	Coordinate continually with the owner. 
•	 ➠

Grouping of tasks: 
Person 1: Tasks 1, 2, 4, 9 and 10. This could be a head of department. 
Person 2: Tasks 3 and 5. This could be a salesperson. 
Person 3: Tasks 6, 7 and 8. This could be an accounting clerk. 
Now, the owner has the option of appointing three people to do these tasks. 
If, however, the business is too small to warrant this number of people, some of the jobs 
could be combined and only two people could be appointed. An accounting clerk could also 
be appointed on a temporary basis, for example, for one day a week.
Once the owner has decided on the number of possible new employees, job descriptions 
and job specifications should be drawn up for these people. 
Job descriptions should be drawn up (and kept up to date) so that the work poses a 
challenge and keeps an employee busy for an entire day. This process is explained in 
Table 12.1.
Table 12.1:  Job analysis, job description and job specification
Job analysis
A process to collect all the important data about the job. This includes duties, responsibilities, 
skills needed, outcomes and working environment. From this, a job description and a job 
specification is drawn up.

•	 Location: administration section
•	 Job summary/outcome: manage and attend to 
all administrative and financial matters
•	 Duties: keep record of accounts, keep the 
books up to date and calculate ordering and

•	 Qualification: B.Com with Accounting 
and Financial Management III
•	 Experience: 2 years in similar position
•	 Training: stock control

•	 Equipment: computer
•	 Supervisor: UR Boss (owner of business)
•	 Job environment: private office with air 
conditioner
•	 Dangers: none
•	 Personality: friendly, confident, honest 
and hard-working
Of course you can also include any additional information you deem necessary in a job 
description. You will probably use the job specification when advertising the position, 
so adapt it to your specific needs. Put in all the qualifications and attributes that you 
want the candidate to possess. 
The job description and specification are important aids for a manager. They are not 
only used for appointing new employees, but also for the following:
•	 control purposes where work done is measured against set standards 
•	 performance evaluation to determine whether outcomes were reached 
•	 promotions to see when employees are doing more than what is expected 
•	 the identification of training needs where outcomes are not met
•	 the establishment of salary scales when looking at job content. 
Now that you know exactly what type of person you need in the business (according to 
the job description and job specification), you have to find the person to fill the vacant 
position. The process of finding suitable persons for the job is called recruitment. 
12.3.2		 Recruitment 
If there are any people in the business that could fill the position, you could consider 
them for the job and promotion (if it is a higher position). If this is not the case, you will 
have to look for suitable employees outside the business. So, the two sources available 
for recruitment are internal (existing employees) and external (the labour market out-
side the business). 
A temporary shortage of staff, however, could be overcome by having the existing em-
ployees work overtime, training existing employees, sub-contracting and outsourcing. 
Once the personnel need is determined, the human resource manager must find suitable 
employees and motivate them to apply for the available positions. Recruitment consists 
of those activities and efforts on behalf of the business to seek and find suitable potential 
employees and to persuade them to apply for the available positions in the business. 

232
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
Remember that all the decisions and actions concerning recruitment should fall within 
the framework of the recruitment policy of the business, including the sources of, and 
general approach to, recruitment. 
As an example, let us assume that there is a position in the business that has to be 
filled. As you have seen, the details of the position are set out in the job description and 
specification. Recruitment can now be done internally or externally. Internal sources are 
usually tapped when suitable employees are available inside the business. Of course, 
this depends on whether they have the potential to be trained and prepared for the 
available positions and groomed for senior positions. Internal recruitment methods 
include job posting, self-selection, proficiency surveys and references.
•	 Job posting is one of the most popular methods of filling positions in a business. 
It includes traditional bulletin boards, computer email-based systems and 
iRecruitment systems. The positions are ‘advertised’ internally through any of these 
methods. 
•	 Self-selection involves advertising the position within the business. Any employee 
who meets the requirements may apply. 
•	 Proficiency surveys are done on employees within the business. Their training, 
experience and qualifications are updated on file and, when a post becomes vacant, 
the job specification is compared with the surveys to identify a suitable candidate. 
•	 References are used for recruiting both internally and externally. Current employees 
recommend their family and friends (often not allowed) for vacant positions. 
If there are no internal candidates available, external sources have to be used. A 
combination of sources may also be exploited. Examples of external recruitment sources 
and methods are:
•	 training institutions such as schools, colleges, and universities 
•	 self-presentation where job-seekers present themselves at employment offices 
•	 advertisements in newspapers, magazines and electronic media 
•	 employment agencies that recruit on behalf of businesses. The following are exam-
ples of such agencies in South Africa: ‘Find A Student’, ‘Employ SA’, ‘Jobfinder’, 
and ‘Affirmative Portfolios’. Of course, recruitment agencies are not free and most 
of them will charge you a fee equal to a percentage of the salary of the appointed 
person. Some also negotiate a placement fee or recruitment commission 
•	 professional institutions include specialised employment agencies, such as the South 
African Institute of CA’s, ‘Executives on the Web’, and ‘Skill Sourcing’ (catering for 
information technology staff). 

Chapter 12: The human resource function
233
Keep in mind that there is a high cost involved in making use of employment agencies 
and professional institutions. However, this might be worth it if you take into account the 
internal costs and problems incurred by doing the recruitment and selection yourself.
The question that arises is which of these methods should one use. Lower-level posts, 
such as officials, artisans and junior sales staff could be advertised in a local newspaper. 
If you are looking for a specific type of employee, you have to advertise specifically. 
Specialised periodicals can be used. If you are looking for a human resource person, 
you could use human resource periodicals, magazines or professional associations. 
When middle and higher-level positions are vacant, you may wish to advertise more 
widely, such as in the weekend newspapers or national periodicals. 
To advertise a position you need to compile an advertisement. The following information 
should be included in it:
•	 job title 
•	 salary 
•	 important features of the work 
•	 requirements of the successful candidate 
•	 fringe benefits 
•	 application procedures 
•	 the person in charge of the applications 
•	 a brief description of the business. 
Of course, you may omit some information and add other details to suit your needs. 
Look at current advertisements to give you more ideas. Look on the internet and in 
newspapers. Choose one advertisement for a position as a Human Resource Official. 
Compare the information in the advertisement with the information given above. Is it a 
good advertisement? 
During the recruitment campaign, candidates apply for available posts. Applications 
are accepted until a predetermined date on which applications close. 
12.3.3		 Selection 
Once an advertisement has gone public, potential employees will start applying for 
the position and you will start receiving applications. The following step is called 
NB
Do

234
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
the selection process. Selection is the process by which the business chooses the most 
suitable person for the advertised position from the list of applicants. 
Various selection methods may be used and it is advisable to use not only one, but 
a combination. Each selection method has particular advantages and disadvantages. 
Whichever methods you use, they should give you the information you require. Cost-
efficiency should also be taken into account. The following selection tools are available: 
•	 application forms 
•	 interviews 
•	 psychometric tests 
•	 physical tests and exams
•	 background investigations
•	 assessment centres 
•	 medical examinations 
•	 references. 
Application forms consist of a list of general questions aimed at collecting biographical 
data and specific questions regarding the requirements of the vacant post. This enables 
you to obtain a general impression of how suitable a person is and to determine whether 
the person meets the minimum requirements of the post. You should be familiar with 
the latest legislation regarding issues such as faith, age and sex. Questioning candidates 
about these issues is not acceptable. 
The selection interview is a discussion between the applicant and the employer aimed 
at obtaining further information regarding the applicant. (The employer may also ask 
other managers and/or specialists to sit on the selection interview panel to assist with 
the process.) Simultaneously, the interview gives the applicant the opportunity to 
obtain more information regarding the business and the job in question. 
Psychometric testing is used to obtain information regarding the personality of the ap-
plicant or to make sure that the information obtained during the interview is correct. 
These tests must be performed by professionals in this field and include personality 
and aptitude tests. 
Physical tests are done to determine whether the candidate meets the physical require-
ments of the job. These tests can also identify possible hidden ailments.
Background investigations are done to check previous employment, criminal records 
and even credit history. The depth of such an investigation will be determined by the 
type of job applied for. Employees working with money will obviously be checked 
more thoroughly.

Chapter 12: The human resource function
235
At assessment centres the job content is investigated and the aptitudes and behaviour 
required of the incumbent are identified. Exercises are designed for the applicant to 
do. The behaviour of the applicant is observed and recorded by trained assessors. This 
gives the applicants the opportunity to show their specific skills, characteristics and 
behaviour. Examples of such exercises are the ‘in-tray’ and ‘case studies’. 
Medical examinations used to be quite popular as part of the selection process, but are 
seldom used today because they are regarded as discriminatory. However, with certain 
physically demanding jobs, such as mining, they are required and are the norm. 
References provide information about the applicant’s job history and are supplied by 
previous employers/managers/supervisors. This is done with the applicant’s permis-
sion. 
The selection procedure is not the same for all businesses and differs according to needs 
and preferences, but for most purposes, the following steps can be followed: 
Step 1: Conduct a preliminary selection interview 
Determine whether the qualifications and interests of the applicant are suitable for the 
requirements of the post. The idea is to get an overall impression of the candidates and 
to provide them with general information about the business. Those applicants who 
have not yet completed application forms are asked to do so. 
Step 2: Application form 
Some businesses prefer to have the application form completed as the first step. They 
work through the forms received and thereafter invite chosen candidates for a first 
interview. The application form is designed around the specific needs of the business. 
Personal information (such as qualifications, training and experience) is evaluated and 
compared with the job specifications. If you do not have such a form, look at other 
businesses’ application forms and create your own according to your requirements. 
Step 3: Selection tests 
The type of work will determine the tests that need to be done. These are designed to 
obtain additional information, including intelligence, computer skills, personality traits 
and other special abilities that could not be obtained from the application form.
Various tests exist for the following: clerical aptitude, vision, interest and intellectual 
ability. These tests are done by specialists and it is advisable to spend some money at 
this stage on having the tests done professionally than appointing the wrong person 
and experiencing great frustration at a later stage. 
Step 4: Check references 
Any information that is not yet known can be obtained from previous employers or 
referees. Such information can be obtained by telephone, letter or a personal visit. 

236
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
A referee is a person whose name the applicant provides and from whom you can obtain 
more information on the applicant.   
This step is essential to determine the credibility of the applicant and should not be neglect-
ed. You can learn much from previous employers. Remember, however, to ‘read between 
the lines’ when you speak to previous employers, because they may gloss over important 
defects in the applicant’s character.  
Step 5: Final interview 
During this interview, all the information gathered during the selection process is 
integrated and you should aim to clarify uncertainties. Usually, a team is present at this 
interview – a panel that should include the line manager, the human resource manager, 
a union representative and anyone else that this team considers necessary, such as a 
specialist in the field where the vacant post is. This person could assist with specialist 
job knowledge. The candidate is also given an opportunity to ask questions and clarify 
any uncertainties. 
The objectives of the final interview are to determine whether the candidate is suitable 
for the vacant position and whether the candidate would be able to get along with the 
manager and the other employees in the section. Look at the person as a whole, the 
good and the bad points, and remember that no-one is perfect. Past performance is 
usually a good indication of what to expect in the future. 
Prepare the questions that you want to ask. The following are examples of interview 
questions:
•	 Why are you applying for the post? 
•	 How do you view your role in the business? 
•	 How do you see yourself contributing towards making the business more produc-
tive? 
Step 6: Medical examination 
The candidate must be physically suitable for the job to be done. If there is any problem, 
it should be identified in good time. High medical claims and absentee figures will 
thereby be avoided. 
Step 7: Final choice 
The candidate who is finally selected is usually the one whose qualifications, experience 
and personality correspond with the job specification. Be objective and remember that 
you need someone who can do the job. 
D
NB

Chapter 12: The human resource function
237
Step 8: Final offer 
Make an offer in writing to the chosen candidate. In the letter you could congratulate 
the person, give a starting date, salary scale and other benefits attached to the job. In 
the larger organisations the administration and actual appointment is usually handled 
by the human resource section.
The applicant must now decide, within a stated timeframe given by the employer, 
whether to accept the offer or not. The offer may also be negotiated, depending on the 
wishes of the owner/manager. A contract is negotiated which usually contains the basic 
policy and conditions of service, such as working hours, leave and overtime. 
If the offer is not accepted, the next most suitable candidate should be considered. 
Step 9: Appointment 
When the candidate accepts the offer, all administrative matters must be finalised. The 
selection process comes to an end here. 
12.3.4		 Employment and placing 
Employment involves not only the process whereby the new employee reports to the 
workplace, but also the accompanying administrative tasks that have to be performed. 
The human resource manager ensures that the necessary forms, such as unemployment 
insurance, tax and medical aid (where applicable) are completed and any other out-
standing information is obtained from the employee. Arrangements for the transport of 
the newcomer’s furniture and work items are also made where applicable. 
Placement, which is the penultimate step in the process of providing human resource, 
now follows. This is the process whereby the new employee is placed in the post applied 
for. The most suitable employee is allocated where his or her expertise can best be 
utilised to the benefit of the business in carrying out those tasks allocated to him or her. 
Placement also occurs when an employee is promoted, transferred or demoted. A good 
recruitment and selection process should automatically lead to effective placement. 
12.3.5		 Orientation 
The orientation process should already be in progress at this stage. The orientation 
(also known as incorporation or induction) of newcomers is the process whereby new 
employees are first introduced to the business, its procedures, environment and work 
situation and, second, to their co-workers, subordinates and superiors. 
This is an opportunity that the employer should use to motivate new employees and 
put them at ease. There are many benefits for the business in the long term if new 
employees understand from the very outset how the business works and if they can 

238
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
communicate effectively with other people in the business. This will also make a new 
employee happy and, therefore, productive. 
Proper orientation needs an orientation programme. List all the things you should do 
regarding the new employee:
•	 before the employee arrives at the business 
•	 on the first day 
•	 during the first two weeks
•	 during the first six months. 
There are many things that you can do during these orientation stages. The following 
are some suggestions. 
Before new employees arrive at the business 
Congratulate the appointees. Send formal letters of welcome and information brochures 
about the business to the successful candidates. Information, such as working hours, 
dress code, schools and estate agents in the area and the general policy of the business 
is usually appreciated. Ensure that their office or workspace is in order and that the 
necessary furniture, equipment and stationery are in place before they arrive. Inform 
the other employees about the newcomers and explain what they will be doing. 
On the first day 
Be available to meet them and to introduce them to the other employees. Speak to them 
informally to put them at ease. Show them their office space or work areas. Finalise ad-
ministrative matters, such as the completion of the necessary forms. Get them working 
as soon as possible. If necessary, appoint someone to orientate the newcomers. Check 
with them about their transport and accommodation. 
During the first two weeks 
Newcomers should be introduced to the following systematically:
•	 the activities of the section and how it supports the business as a whole 
•	 their duties and responsibilities (refer to the job description) 
•	 how, when and where they are paid 
•	 working hours, leave policy, meal and tea breaks 
•	 the use of the telephone 
•	 dress code 
•	 recreation facilities. 

Chapter 12: The human resource function
239
During the first six months 
To ensure that the maximum benefit is gained from newcomers, orientation does not 
end after two weeks. They have to develop and become more productive. Identify any 
shortcomings and training needs and see that something is put in place to rectify the 
situation. 
An orientation programme can leave a positive and lasting impression of an employer. 
It is an opportunity that management should take advantage of to motivate and to 
inspire their loyalty. Understanding each other and communicating well from the start 
have many beneficial consequences in the long run. 
12.3.6		 Human resource provision and the law 
Since the implementation of the Labour Relations Act, No. 66 of 1995 as amended (Act 
12 of 2002), the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, No. 75 of 1997 as amended (Act 
11 of 2002) and the Employment Equity Act, No. 55 of 1998, quite a few important 
issues regarding the employment process have arisen. Human resource managers and 
business owners will have to adjust their policies and procedures and apply them fairly 
and consistently to all applicants. A failure to do so could have major implications for 
the business. The main issue here is that all forms of discrimination are forbidden by 
law. 
12.4	 HUMAN RESOURCE TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT 
Most newcomers in a business are not really prepared to perform their new tasks 
well. Someone who holds a technical or professional qualification still needs initial 
orientation regarding the policies, procedures and practices of the organisation. The 
training process, therefore, begins with the orientation programme. 
12.4.1		 The aims of training and development 
The concepts of training and development are often taken to mean the same thing, yet 
they refer to two different activities within the business. 
Training is the systematic process by which the employee acquires knowledge, skills, 
aptitudes and information necessary to achieve the objectives of the business. The aim of 
training is to influence and change employees’ working habits and levels of performance in 
such a way that they will become more productive. Training is, therefore, directed at tasks 
which are in line with the objectives of the business.     
The basic objectives of training and development are:
•	 to orientate new employees with regard to their tasks 
D

240
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
•	 to improve performance and increase productivity 
•	 to maintain a performance level in spite of changes in the work itself or in technology 
•	 to prepare the employee for promotion. 
Before any training can be undertaken, you should first determine whether there is 
really a need for training. An employee may just be experiencing personal problems 
and his or her work may suffer as a result. A supervisor may not know this and may 
mistakenly identify the problem as a lack of knowledge or skills. Training costs time 
and money and you should, therefore, ensure that it is not undertaken unnecessarily. 
12.4.2		 Drawing up a training programme 
When you draw up a training programme, the following steps can be used: 
(a)  Determine training needs 
Before training can commence, a needs assessment should be done. These needs are 
related to the technical, administrative, management as well as other skills which 
employees may require to perform their duties productively. It is the responsibility of 
the direct supervisor to identify these needs. 
There are different ways to identify the needs, such as:
•	 The employee is asked to say whether he or she feels unqualified to carry out a task 
effectively due to a lack of knowledge and/or skills. Although this is not a scientific 
method to determine training needs and does not provide for long-term needs, it is a 
practical method which can be used profitably in combination with other methods. 
•	 Interviews, where the human resource manager conducts interviews with supervi-
sors, key people and employees in the business to ascertain which, if any, training 
needs exist. 
•	 Using a questionnaire is a scientific method of ascertaining training needs and 
results obtained from it are usually comprehensive and based on fact. 
•	 The management by objectives technique provides ongoing information regarding 
the work and progress of the employee. You should, therefore, be able to see imme-
diately whether an employee needs training. 
The above are active techniques to determine whether there is a need for training. 
Sometimes, circumstances or problems arising in a business may also indicate training 
needs. Specific problem areas which need to be investigated include low productivity, 
high costs, poor quality, high wastage, grievances, a high staff turnover, poor discipline, 
rule-breaking, a high absenteeism rate and standards that are not being met. 

Chapter 12: The human resource function
241
(b)	 Establish the objectives for the training programme (including the 
	
type of training) 
Write down what you wish to achieve with the training. Be specific and use standards 
so that your objectives are measurable. The difference between what the employee is 
supposed to do (see job description) and what he or she can actually do may also be 
used as a basis for the training programme. Do the employees need basic training, such 
as training in the use of the telephone or more specific training, such as training to 
enable them to use a new computer programme? 
(c)  Determine suitable training methods 
Decide whether you will make use of lectures, in-service training, videos, case studies 
or other methods. Are you going to instruct, facilitate or both? If the training know-
how is already in the business, you can do it internally, otherwise make use of external 
training specialists. 
(d)  Present the training or send employees for the training 
Decide whether it is best to carry out the training on-site, or to send your employees to 
another venue. 
(e)  Evaluate the training 
Determine whether the set objectives have been achieved. If not, you will have to 
reassess the trainer, method, objectives and standards (or all of these). 
Human resource management is not only getting people to work for a business 
and training them to do the work well, but keeping them motivated and working 
productively on a continuous basis. 
12.5	 HUMAN RESOURCE MAINTENANCE 
Human resource maintenance involves all those activities that make the work situation 
acceptable to the employee. It costs the business a lot of money, time and human re-
sources to employ suitable employees. Management and supervisors should, therefore, 
do everything in their power to make the best use of employees and motivate them to 
ensure that they remain in the service of the business. 
In order to accomplish this, we look at remuneration, performance management, per-
sonnel administration, working conditions and labour relations. 
12.5.1 Remuneration 
Remuneration is what employees receive in exchange for the input they offer the 
business. Management has certain responsibilities regarding remuneration. 

242
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
Remuneration should correspond with the remuneration for the same type of work in similar 
businesses. Necessary adjustments should be made from time to time to keep pace with the 
rising cost of living and inflation.
If the above requirements are not met, it can be expected that staff turnover will be 
high, employees will lack motivation, unions will be in constant wage negotiations and 
productivity will suffer. 
Remuneration can be paid to employees in various ways. We can differentiate between 
direct and indirect remuneration. Direct remuneration is the salary or wage an employee 
receives. It could also include bonuses and allowances for travel and other activities. 
Salaries are usually paid monthly and wages weekly or daily. To differentiate between 
productive employees and those who do as little as possible, they can be paid per task 
or piece of work. This is known as the ‘piece-wage’ or ‘piece-rate’ system. An employee 
is paid a sum of money when a specific task or piece of work is completed. The time 
taken to complete the task is not taken into consideration. For example, the employee is 
paid R20 for each box of products he or she unpacks, regardless of how long this takes. 
Every business has its own particular kinds of indirect remuneration or fringe benefits. 
Over and above the employee’s salary, the business may pay the following:
•	 Pension: some employers contribute to an employee’s pension 
•	 Insurance: certain types, for example, workmen’s compensation and disability 
insurance are sometimes borne by the business 
•	 Housing: a subsidy, low interest rates or even free housing can be given 
•	 Transport: various forms of allowances may be given 
•	 Leave: although the Basic Conditions of Employment Act 11 of 2002 compels em-
ployers to allow employees to take leave, this may also be regarded as a fringe  
benefit 
•	 Profit sharing: if the profit for a period is higher than a predetermined amount, 
management could decide to pay the employees a certain percentage of that profit. 
This makes the employees feel that they have a personal stake in the business, which 
should have a motivating effect. 
Indirect remuneration (or fringe benefits) are not necessarily given to all the employees. 
It usually depends on the level of the employee’s post. Certain fringe benefits are given 
only to employees above a specific level in the hierarchy. The combination of direct and 
indirect remuneration is usually referred to as the employee’s package.
The main question is usually how much to pay the employee. When a salary is 
determined, it is a good idea to look at the salaries of similar posts in other similar 
NB

Chapter 12: The human resource function
243
businesses. The value of the post must then be compared with the value of other posts 
in the same business. Remuneration systems may be determined in various ways, but 
this is usually done by the human resource specialists. 
Posts are arranged in order of rank from the employee on the lowest level to top 
management. A remuneration policy is determined and a salary scale is assigned to 
every post in the business. The policy should be made known to the employees and 
they should know why they are linked to a particular salary scale or structure. 
Table 12.2 is an example of salary scales for a small business.
Table 12.2:  Salary scales of a small business

4
Supervisor
R250 000 – R350 000
5
Co-director
R400 000 – R600 000
There are other factors that will also determine how much employees are paid, such as:
•	 the supply and demand of labour 
•	 the business’s ability to pay
•	 the prevailing minimum wage. 
When employees are paid, there are also other aspects that the human resource 
manager should attend to. Not only the business, but also the employees should be 
registered with the Receiver of Revenue. Each employee should have a tax number. It 
is the employer’s responsibility to deduct tax from the salaries of the employees and to 
pay this monthly to the Receiver. The amounts deducted must be according to tables 
obtained from the Receiver. At the end of the tax year (February 28), each employee 
must be issued with an IRP5 form. This is a summary of the employee’s income and 
deductions for the past year. 
According to the Department of Labour, a payslip, which every employee should 
receive when paid, must contain the following information:
•	 employer’s name and address 
•	 employee’s name and occupation 

244

•	 period for which payment is made 
•	 total salary or wages 
•	 all deductions 
•	 the actual amount paid 
•	 if relevant, the calculation of pay:

number of ordinary and overtime hours worked

the total number of ordinary and overtime hours worked in the period. 
Instead of making use of permanent employees, you might also use ‘contractors’ to 
get the job done. These employees do not work for a salary, but are contracted to do a 
certain job and then get paid for that job, similar to the piece-wage system. If they work 
more, they get paid more; if less then they get paid less. 
Let us assume that there is a need for a job to be done and the human resource manager 
decides to make use of contractors. Human resources must come to an agreement with 
the contractors about the job to be done and the amount to be paid for the job. A contract 
is drawn up; both parties accept the contract and sign it together with two witnesses. 
The contract must state the following:
•	 Details of service or product to be provided: This is the job that is expected of the 
contractor. Sometimes, it is necessary to include a lot of detail so that both parties 
understand exactly what the contract entails. 
•	 Machines, materials, stock and maintenance: It must be stated who will provide 
what and the standards involved. 
•	 Fee structure: The amount you will pay for the completed task, for each section or 
for specific services rendered. 
•	 Dates of commencement and completion of the job. 
•	 Breakdown or any other hold-up: Discuss the consequences and actions. 
•	 Indemnity, guarantees, liability and insurance, any legalities, safety and security 
rules and regulations. 
Contractors do not have the same rights and advantages as employees. For example, 
contractors cannot have paid leave, must pay their own medical aid fees and must cater 
for their own pension and insurance. Contractors work independently for themselves 
and are in no way part of the business for which the work is being done. 

Chapter 12: The human resource function

12.5.2		 Labour relations 
‘Labour relations’ is concerned with the creation, maintenance, amendment and administra-
tion of rules, control processes, ideologies, interactions and relationships in the workplace.  
There are three participants to consider: labour, management and government.
Labour is the human effort which is offered with the aim of acquiring an income.
Management (in this case, the employer), first aims to run the business profitably so 
that it can continue to exist and grow. The second function of management is to utilise 
the available production factors optimally. Special attention should be given to labour, 
which is usually the most important resource. The ability to control and utilise this 
resource will, to a large extent, determine the success of the business. 
The role of government differs from country to country, depending on the prevailing 
socio-economic and political dispensation. Government’s role includes providing the 
legislative framework for labour relations. 
The labour relations system is, therefore, a three-way relationship between labour, manage-
ment and government. It is in the interest of both labour and management to strive for a 
climate free of conflict and to settle the conflicts that do arise themselves in an orderly way, 
with the help of appropriate institutions.
In many cases, employees are members of a union, which is a permanent representation 
of employees in an industry, business or profession, established to regulate matters of 
economic interest by way of negotiations with management, so as to improve working 
conditions and general living standards. 
Since a poor relationship with a union can cause much harm to a business, most em-
ployers conclude a memorandum of recognition with the unions. The memorandum in-
cludes provisions relating to grievance procedures, mediation, safety measures, use of 
noticeboards and the administration of the agreement. To make this agreement binding, 
it must comply with the common-law requirements of a valid contract. The proposed 
provisions should not clash with labour legislation, otherwise the agreement becomes 
invalid. Recognition of a union implies an agreement, a relationship and a process. 
It is essential to keep up to date with the relevant labour legislation, especially the 
issues contained in the Labour Relations Act. You can find all the details on the website 
of the Department of Labour: http://www.labour.gov.za/. Other information that you 
can find there includes forms, sample documents and guidelines covering many labour 
relations issues.

12.5.3		 Personnel administration 
The quality of decisions taken by management with regard to employees is dependent 
on the availability, completeness and accuracy of information pertaining to each person. 
The human resource division is responsible for thorough record-keeping of all relevant 
human resource data including age, qualifications, and courses completed and each 
person’s service record in the business, including promotions, merits and transfers. 
This data should be stored in such a way that it is quickly accessible when management 
makes decisions regarding promotions, transfers, rationalisation, training, development 
and other similar changes. 
Employees must be familiar with the policy of the business. In most businesses, this 
policy is contained in a personnel manual which is available to employees at all times. 
Details contained in the manual include conditions of service, leave codes, rights and 
privileges of employees, disciplinary and grievance procedures. Since we operate in 
such a dynamic environment, the manual needs to be updated constantly.
It goes without saying that management must not deviate from what is contained in the 
manual. This could lead to conflict and unhappiness. Communication with employees 
in this regard is extremely important. In many cases, it is more advantageous for the 
employer first to discuss or negotiate any policy or other changes to the manual with 
employees before they are implemented. 
12.5.4		 Working conditions 
It is essential that working conditions should be pleasant and safe before one can 
expect employees to be motivated and productive. Unsafe, unhygienic and unpleasant 
conditions may result in an employee being injured or becoming ill. The consequences 
of bad working conditions are usually greater absenteeism, a fall in productivity and a 
drop in profits. 
Accidents in the work situation are caused by unsafe conditions and unsafe practices. 
These types of conditions and practices must be eliminated. According to the National 
Occupational Safety Association (NOSA), the elimination of unsafe conditions should 
come first. Examples of unsafe conditions are unsafe constructions, slippery and other-
wise dangerous surfaces, overcrowding in workshops, a lack of protective clothing,  
inadequate ventilation and poor lighting in work areas. Although these conditions 
cause the smallest number of accidents, they are situations that can be remedied per-
manently and at relatively low cost. It is management’s responsibility to ensure that the 
workplace is safe and hygienic, and that personnel use the right protective clothing and 
equipment. 
Unsafe practices, on the other hand, are the result of human error and, as such, more 
difficult to change. It is mostly an attitude or disposition that has to change, and as 
you might know, this is not so easy. Management should, therefore, first do everything 

Chapter 12: The human resource function
247
possible to ensure that the working environment is safe before it can expect personnel 
to work safely. Accidents caused by human error refer to unsafe acts (practices), while 
accidents resulting from technical failures refer to unsafe conditions. Examples of unsafe 
practices are working too fast, working without authorisation, setting – or working on 
– moving equipment, taking chances/risks, moving in unsafe places and the refusal to 
wear protective clothing. 
To prevent accidents, you have to know their causes. There are five basic causes which 
are divided into the following two categories:
•	 Personal factors: lack of knowledge and/or skills, physical or psychological 
distractions, incorrect attitude or motivation 
•	 Work factors: unsafe conditions and physical environment; inadequate working 
standards. 
Managers at all levels must exercise constant control over employees to ensure that the 
above factors do not arise. It is important to be on the lookout constantly for anything 
that might cause an accident. As far as safety is concerned, it is vital to take preventive 
action at all times. 
There are various ways in which one can help ensure that employees remain healthy 
and productive, for example:
•	 a clean workplace, recreation room and rest room 
•	 sufficient leave, acceptable working hours and little or no over-exertion 
•	 first aid provision in case of an accident or illness 
•	 a suitable and pleasant workplace 
•	 ergonomically designed office equipment, especially the desk and chair 
•	 sufficient lighting that eliminates reflection and, where possible, uses natural 
daylight regulated by means of blinds 
•	 limiting noise and noise intensity by isolating machines and pipes, making use of 
carpeted and cork floors and/or acoustic tiles 
•	 temperature regulation by air-conditioning, especially where large fluctuations 
occur, as excessive heat results in discomfort and fatigue. 
With regard to certain of these factors, employers are compelled by law to provide 
such an environment. You would be well advised to read the Occupational Health and 
Safety Act to ensure that your business does indeed comply. A business cannot afford  
to neglect the maintenance of its most important resource – human resource.

There are many other human resource issues related to Basic Conditions of Employ-
ment, such as the Unemployment Insurance Fund, for example. If you wish to know 
more about these, you should visit the department of labour website (http://www.
labour.gov.za/) to get the latest information. There you will find information on just 
about everything that you need. The following are some of the issues and subjects dis-
cussed and explained there.

12.6	 SUMMARY 
As an entrepreneur, if you own a small business, numerous staff matters require your 
attention. The fewer employees you have, the easier it should be. If your business grows 
and you need to appoint a lot of people, it is advisable to get assistance from a human 
resource specialist. 
The aim of the human resource function in a business is not only to recruit, select and 
employ suitable staff; it is also to develop, train and, in some cases, educate existing 
staff, so that employees are utilised to their full potential. 
The employment process costs money, requires human resource and takes up a lot of 
time. It is, therefore, essential that the staff of the business are well looked after. The 
personnel are indeed the most important production factor in the business and a high 
staff turnover is very harmful for any business in terms of costs and continuity. 
The activities of the human resource division are not always quantifiable, but, as you 
saw in this chapter, they are in no way inferior to the other functions of the business. 
Self-evaluation questions 
1.	
‘The human resource function is one of the eight functions found in most 
businesses.’ Discuss this statement and indicate briefly for which tasks the 
human resource manager is responsible. 
2.

An introduction to 
fi nancial management for 
entrepreneurs 
13
Chapter
13.1 LEARNING OUTCOMES 
After you have studied this chapter, you should be able to:  
• explain why fi nancial management is important to a small business owner/ manager 
• explain how fi nancial management relates to the other functional activities in a small 
business 
• explain and defi ne fi nancial management as a concept and as an organisational function 
• explain how the generic functions of management are applied in fi nancial management 
• explain the most important concepts (eg different forms of assets and liabilities, fi xed and 
variable capital needed, ROI and ROE) used in fi nancial management 
• explain the most important fi nancial activities in a business 
• calculate ROI and ROE of a business.      
Students should also be able to give everyday examples (preferably from their own 
experience) for each of the above-mentioned aspects of fi nancial management.
13.2 INTRODUCTION 
The following questions are often asked by existing and potential small business 
entrepreneurs:
• Is this a fair price to ask (or pay) for a specifi c business? 
• How much should my monthly sales be in order for me to survive in my new 
business? 
• How can I know for sure if I am running my business at a profi t or at a loss? 
• Is the profi t I am making satisfactory? 
• Is it better (safer, more profi table) to use only my own capital (such as savings), or is 
it better to borrow additional capital? 

252
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
•	 When I use my own and borrowed capital, what should the balance be between 
these two sources? 
•	 When my business needs a sharp increase in stock during a peak season, should it 
be financed with a long-term loan or short-term credit? 
•	 Should I sell my products and services for cash only or should I also extend credit 
facilities to my clients? 
•	 What are the advantages and disadvantages of selling on credit? 
•	 How can I be sure that the stock I have purchased for resale purposes will in fact 
sell? 
•	 How important is cash flow management to me as a small business entrepreneur? 
•	 How important is effective administration to business success? 
These are only examples of the many questions a small business entrepreneur should 
ask (and get answers for) on a regular basis. The success of a small business depends on 
answering these questions well! 
No-one can be a successful small business entrepreneur or a successful manager without 
a thorough understanding of financial management. Small business entrepreneurs do 
not need to be chartered accountants or specialists in world money markets. However, 
each and every small business entrepreneur/manager must have a good insight into 
and understanding of the core concepts and the fundamental elements of financial 
management. This is an area that is simply too important to ignore. I know about a very, 
very wealthy entrepreneur who is dyslectic (he cannot read or write properly), but he 
says the main reason for his business success is that ‘I can count very well!’ In business 
one has to watch the figures like a hawk! 
The aim of this chapter is to introduce you to the exciting and very important world 
of business finance. Through an explanation and illustrations of the concepts and ele-
ments of basic financial management, you will develop a thorough knowledge and 
understanding of these concepts and elements. By working through the chapters in this 
book, you will acquire the expertise to be able to apply these concepts to the manage-
ment of an existing small business or the launch of a new venture. 
Anna Molele is an excellent salesperson with more than 10 years’ experience working for a 
variety of furniture retailers. She is very good at selecting and purchasing the right furniture 
from manufacturers and communicating with and convincing existing and potential clients 
to buy. Now she is planning to start her own furniture retail business and has spent much 
time preparing her business plan. Just last night she said to her husband:

‘All my plans are in place. I am going to invest as much as possible in purchasing stock and 
in marketing my business. At the same time, I will spend as little as possible time and effort 
on administration. I hate paperwork, and will leave that to a bookkeeper, whose only task 
will be to satisfy the Receiver of Revenue once a year.’ 
Discuss Anna’s view of administration and paperwork. Write down at least five ‘common 
sense’ arguments to support and/or to oppose Anna’s view. 
13.3	 THE FINANCIAL FUNCTION IN BUSINESS 
For a business to operate on a profitable, successful and sustainable basis, a number of 
business functions and activities need to be identified and managed. Typical examples 
of such activities and functions are marketing, human resources, production, and secu-
rity and safety. Another one of these functions is the financial function. The financial 
function is just as important as any other and the owner or manager of any small busi-
ness must pay close attention to it. 
No single business function is more or less important than another. Each and every 
business and management function is important to business success and all of them are 
interrelated. Together, they enable the business to achieve its mission and goals. 
The financial management function is distinguished from the other managerial and 
business functions and activities, but should never be seen in isolation from the others. 
Each of these other business functions and activities has financial implications for the 
business. For example:
•	 unproductive employees have a detrimental effect on the financial performance of 
the small business 
•	 a lack of marketing activities will lead to a lack of income for the small business 
•	 purchasing products for resale that are not in demand in the marketplace leads to 
high storage and other costs, with no acceptable return for the small business. 
A number of functions need to be managed well in any small business:
•	 human resources management ensures that the business has sufficient capable 
people who are working productively 
•	 marketing management ensures that there are enough clients supporting the busi-
ness 
•	 production management (also called operational management) ensures that the 
business effectively produces high-quality products or services 

254
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
•	 financial management ensures that the business has access to needed capital 
resources and makes the best use of these. 
13.4	 DEFINING FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
Financial management is responsible for acquiring the necessary financial resources to 
ensure the most advantageous financial results for the small business over both the short 
and long term. The term ‘financial management’ also covers the responsibility for making 
sure the business makes the best use of its financial resources.     
13.4.1		 Examples of financial management 
To illustrate the above definition, here are some examples of financial management:
•	 arranging in time with a bank manager for an overdraft facility on the best conditions 
possible (acquiring the needed financial resources) 
•	 ensuring that cash received from daily (or evenly hourly) sales is safeguarded and 
banked as quickly and as efficiently possible (making the best use of financial re-
sources). 
13.4.2		 Comparison with other business functions 
It should be clear to you that the financial management function is mainly concerned 
with financial matters. Although all activities in a business have a financial implication, 
we cannot say that financial management is responsible for all these activities or that 
financial management must have the final say over each and every other business 
activity. 
To understand this principle, let us look at an example: 
Emily Ngobeni is the owner/manager of Thanda Stores. She is considering the placement of 
a marketing advertisement in the local newspaper in order to create more sales. She must 
decide which issues of this project are financial management issues and which are market-
ing issues. 
Questions:
1.	 The availability of applicable funds, the method of paying for the advertisement, the 
timing of the payment and the possibility of negotiating a discount are all issues that 
relate to which function of the business? 
2.	 The wording of the advertisement, appropriate illustrations, colour, placement (page 
allocation) and size of the advertisement relate to which function? 
➠
D
eg

Chapter 13: An introduction to financial management for entrepreneurs
255
Answers:
1.	 All are financial management issues. 
2.	 These are all marketing issues. 
In many small businesses, one person (the owner/manager) handles all the manage-
rial and business functions. This means that there is less of a need to distinguish which 
issues are financial, marketing or other functional management issues. In larger or-
ganisations, where different managers are responsible for different functions, this need 
becomes more important. 
13.4.3		 The definition of financial management 
Financial management may be defined as the responsibility for timeously acquiring the 
needed financial resources and ensuring the best use of these resources over the short and 
long term.    
Think about the functions and activities of a small business. From your own experience, give 
every day examples of financial management in the following areas:
(a)	 the acquisition of capital (money to buy something) 
(b)	 the utilisation of capital (using the money available wisely). 
13.5	 THE MANAGERIAL FUNCTIONS OF FINANCIAL 
	
	 MANAGEMENT 
Now that we have defined financial management, we need to ask the following impor-
tant question: ‘How do the generic functions of management apply to financial man-
agement?’ (In general, the generic functions of management are: planning, organising, 
activating and controlling.) 
13.5.1		 Financial planning 
Financial budgets are the most visible and most common outcome of the financial 
planning function. The importance of financial planning can be summed up in the 
following saying: ‘If you fail to plan well, you plan to fail well!’ 
But financial planning is not concerned only with financial budgets. Typically, financial 
management planning includes planning, developing and finalising an appropriate 
D
Do

256

bookkeeping system and deciding on effective pricing and credit policies, financial pro- 
cedures and processes to be followed. This planning function and process is a continuous 
activity and process, and by far not a once-off (or annual) activity. 
13.5.2		 Financial organising 
Another part of financial management is the responsibility to arrange and to organise 
needed activities, equipment and people in the most effective way to carry out the 
financial function. This includes the delegation of financial responsibility to others: for 
example, who will be authorised to make payments on behalf of the small business? 
Who is going to be responsible for verifying the records and cash receipts of cashiers? 
And who will be in charge of credit control? This organising function and process is a 
continuous activity and process, and by far not a once-off (or annual) activity. 
13.5.3		 Financial activating 
This managerial function means a manager’s responsibility to lead and motivate the 
other people in the business and to ensure effective and efficient communication. An 
example of this function in financial management is ensuring that employees doing 
financial work (for example, bookkeeping, cashier work, debt collection, banking, bud-
geting) are well trained and motivated to carry out their tasks as diligently as possible. 
Another example is letting other functional managers (for example, marketing, human 
resources, security, production) know the full details of the next annual financial bud-
geting project in good time. In fact, financial management cannot and should not be 
isolated from these other operational functions – all should work in tandem to ensure 
the best results for the business! 
13.5.4		 Financial controlling 
It is a common mistake of many small business owners and managers to focus only on the 
controlling sides of the financial management function. Many people will point out that 
financial management is only about ‘checking’ records, bookkeeping and all financial 
transactions. These are all part – but definitely not all – of the financial management 
function. It is safe to say that you cannot control something that has not been properly 
planned, organised and activated, because any control activity must have a set standard 
against which an outcome can be measured and judged to be in order or not. 
The better you plan, organise and activate, the better you will be able to control the 
activities of your business. 
There are four steps in the controlling function:
1.	 Determining performance criteria (planning what should be done, what is expected 
to happen): drawing up financial budgets is a typical example. 

Chapter 13: An introduction to financial management for entrepreneurs
257
2.	 Measuring the actual performance (the actual results): setting up an administration 
and bookkeeping system, with regular reporting outputs, is a typical example. 
3.	 Comparing the expected with the actual performance to indicate positive and ne-
gative variances: this indicates acceptable and unacceptable deviations from the 
budget and other criteria. 
4.	 Taking corrective action, where necessary: for example, retraining cashiers to en-
sure that clients are billed and pay 100% correctly and on time. 
13.5.5		 Some financial activities in business 
By now, you should have an idea why financial management is so important in business, 
how it is defined and its relationships with other functions in business. 
Think about the activities of a typical small business. Can you identify at least ten financial 
activities in that business? 
There are many financial activities in a small business. Here are some examples:
•	 Collecting external information on financial matters: for example, changes in 
interest rates; the exchange value of the rand; the availability of capital; trends in 
debt collection; the profitability of similar businesses in the same industry. 
•	 Preparing financial budgets: for example, working together with the marketing 
function to forecast expected/needed sales volumes in the forthcoming year; 
working out a cash flow budget. 
•	 Recording all financial transactions: for example, making sure that credit sales to 
customers are effectively and efficiently recorded and administered. 
•	 Analysing financial performance: for example, continuously and timeously assess-
ing whether actual budgeted income and expenses are on course, according to the 
annual business plan and budgets. 
•	 Financial reporting: supplying the other functions of the business with needed fi-
nancial information (for example, indicating to the production department whether 
labour and/or material expenses are still within the budget or not). 
•	 Safeguarding cash resources: for example, ensuring that cash received daily from 
cash sales and debtors’ payments is safeguarded and banked as soon as possible. 
•	 Formulating credit policy: for example, investigating the advantages and disad-
vantages of selling to customers on credit; ensuring that only creditworthy clients 
are allowed to buy on credit.

•	 Debt collection: for example, ensuring that debtors honour their commitments 
regularly and on time. 
•	 Salary administration: for example, ensuring that all employees receive their cor-
rect remuneration exactly on time. 
•	 Negotiating with suppliers of capital: for example, negotiating with banks or other 
financial institutions the availability of needed bridging capital (say, an overdraft 
facility) at the best conditions possible. 
The above-mentioned activities are only some examples. A number of other activities 
may be added to this list. 
13.6	 IMPORTANT CONCEPTS IN FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
As an introduction to financial management, this section of the chapter briefly explains 
the meaning of a number of financial management concepts. Most of these concepts 
will reappear in other chapters, where they are more fully explained and illustrated. 
The following concepts will be covered: 
•	 assets: fixed assets; current assets; other assets 
•	 capital: own capital (equity); outside or borrowed capital (long-, medium-, short-
term); permanent and variable capital; current capital; working capital 
•	 financial structure 
•	 profitability 
•	 liquidity 
•	 solvency. 
13.6.1		 Assets 
The overall objective of a business is to maximise the rate of return on investment to 
the owner(s) over the long term, taking into consideration the interests of all applicable 
stakeholders.  
To achieve this, the business needs assets, which vary greatly in nature. For example, 
a manufacturing enterprise will definitely need manufacturing equipment, a transport 
enterprise will need vehicles, a retailer will need shop premises, while a management 
consulting enterprise will need people trained in business management techniques. 
NB

Chapter 13: An introduction to financial management for entrepreneurs
259
In all cases, the assets of a business enterprise can be divided into two major categories: 
fixed assets and current assets.
•	 Fixed assets are those assets owned and required by the enterprise for a period 
of longer than 12 months. (Assets that are required but that do not belong to the 
business, such as items that are leased or rented, are not part of fixed assets for 
the purposes of the balance sheet.) Typical fixed assets are: land and buildings; 
equipment and manufacturing machinery; vehicles; furniture. 
•	 Current assets are assets owned by the enterprise that will be turned into sales or 
cash within a period of 12 months. Typical current assets are: outstanding debtors 
(people who owe the business money); stock (inventory); cash (on hand or in the 
bank). 
There is a third category of assets: other assets. These are assets not directly involved 
in the normal operational activities of the business, for example: shares in another 
business; investments in a financial institution. 
To test your understanding of the differences between fixed, current and other assets, 
consider the following small businesses and answer the questions. 
1.	 Business A manufactures school uniforms and has machinery and equipment valued at 
R100 000. 
2.	 Business B buys and sells all sorts of manufacturing machinery and equipment. At 
present, the available stock is valued at a cost price of R100 000. 
3.	 Business C is an accounting firm. It bought some shares on the stock exchange for  
R100 000 as an investment. 
In each of the three cases, is the R100 000 sum a fixed, current or other asset? Why? 
1.	 Business A? Why? 
	
(Answer: fixed asset; the machinery will be used for more than 12 months) 
2.	 Business B? Why? 
	
(Answer: current asset; the inventory will be sold within 12 months) 
3.	 Business C? Why? 
	
(Answer: other asset; the investment is not required for operational purposes) 
13.6.2		 Capital 
The assets required by a business have to be financed, supplied and paid for. For this, 
the business requires capital. We can identify a number of sources: for example, banks 
and manufacturers, that act as the suppliers of the necessary capital or assets to the 
business. Capital supplied is also sometimes called liabilities. 
Do

260
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
The major types of capital are:
•	 Owners’ capital (equity): This is the capital supplied by the owners/shareholders 
of the business, in the form of an initial start-up investment (either in the form of 
assets or as cash) or as accumulative retained net profits, or both. In the case of a 
close corporation (cc), this type of capital is called members’ interest. In the case of 
a company, this may be called share capital. 
•	 Outside (borrowed, loan, foreign) capital: This represents all the capital supplied 
(either in the form of assets or as cash) or made available to the enterprise by sources 
other than the owners/shareholders. When such capital is supplied for a period of 
longer than 12 months, it is called long-term capital. Short-term capital is repayable 
within 12 months. 
•	 Trade credit (when buying stock/raw materials on credit from suppliers) is a form 
of borrowed short-term capital. The same applies to a bank overdraft, while a  
10-year mortgage loan (to help finance a factory building) is regarded as a long-term 
loan. 
•	 Permanent and variable capital: Permanent capital is that amount of assets/funds/
money that is required by an enterprise at all times (say, over a year). Variable capital 
refers to the additional amount of assets/money (over and above the amount of 
permanent capital needed) that the enterprise needs from time to time: for example, 
during seasonal peaks such as Easter and Christmas. 
Mrs Tshabalala owns a boutique selling ladies’ dresses. A minimum stock level of R600 000  
is needed all year round in her business. But three times a year, during the December 
holidays as well as at the start of the winter and summer seasons, she increases her stock 
levels to R1 000 000. In her case, the R600 000 needed to finance the minimum stock level 
all through the year will be regarded as permanent capital, while the additional R400 000 
required only for the three peak periods can be regarded as variable capital. 
•	 Current (liquid, operational) liabilities/capital: This is capital utilised on a short-
term basis (less than a 12-month period) and should normally only be used to 
finance part of the current assets of the enterprise. Examples are: trade creditors, 
bank overdrafts, short-term loans. 
•	 Working capital: This normally refers to the current assets, while net working capi-
tal refers to current assets less current liabilities. 
13.6.3		 Some other concepts 
Financial structure 
This concept relates to the composition of the business’s assets in relation to its sources 
of capital. It also shows the relationships between owners’ capital and long- and short-
eg

Chapter 13: An introduction to financial management for entrepreneurs
261
term outside capital, and how these capital resources were utilised in total to finance 
fixed and current assets. 
Profitability 
Many people will say, ‘This is what business is all about’, and in a sense this is correct. 
The owners of a small business expect to earn a satisfactory profit (as a just return on 
their money, effort and time they have invested as well as remuneration for the risks 
they have taken). This is called return on investment (or ROI) and is expressed as a per-
centage. Profitability is one of the most frequently used and best measures available to 
determine the ultimate degree of success or failure of business operations. Profitability 
is therefore one of the most fundamental and most important concepts in business. 
Two major forms of profitability (there are more than 20 variations) are:
•	 Return on total investment (ROI): This indicates the rate of return on total capital, 
or the profitability of the business as a whole. A high return on investment is proof 
of management’s ability to make good use of capital and assets. A low (or no) return 
on investment indicates management’s inability to add value to the enterprise. 
•	 Return on equity (ROE): This indicates the rate of return on own capital, or the 
profitability of own capital. The actual owners/shareholders of a business are often 
more interested in this measure than in ROI. Fundamentally, the owners are in 
business to maximise the return on their own investment over the long term. This 
ratio can thus be regarded as the bottom line for the small business entrepreneur/
manager. 
It is important to point out that the two kinds of profitability mentioned above should 
not be confused. They are two totally different (but related) concepts. 
Jabulani Moloketi has a small business called J’s Jewellery. He buys and sells all sorts of 
costume jewellery. At the end of the financial year, his business’s financial statements show 
the following: 
Net profit before interest:	
R100 000 
Net profit after interest:	
R70 000 
Total capital employed:	
R400 000 
Owner’s equity:	
R200 000 
•	 ➠
eg

262
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
In Jabulani’s business, the two kinds of profitability will be determined as follows: 
Return on total investment (ROI) 	
= net profit before interest × 100
total capital employed
 
	
= R100 000 × 100
R400 000
	
= 25% per annum
This means that Jabulani has utilised all the capital (or assets, as they are of the same 
monetary value) available to his business in such a way as to show 25c net profit for each 
R1 of total capital (or assets) employed. 
Return on equity (ROE) 	 = net profit after interest × 100
owner’s equity
	
= R70 000 × 100
R200 000
	
= 35% per annum
This means that Jabulani Moloketi was able to use outside and own capital in such a way 
as to show 35c net profit for each R1 of own capital employed per annum. 
Liquidity 
The liquidity of a business has nothing directly to do with its profitability. Many profit-
able (even very profitable) small businesses go bankrupt because of insurmountable 
liquidity problems. Liquidity refers to the ability of the enterprise to pay its short-term 
financial commitments continuously and on time. For example, a business has a liquid-
ity crisis if it is unable to pay its trade creditors when payment is due because of a lack 
of cash (liquid) resources. The same applies to an inability to pay for other liabilities and 
obligations, such as taxes, wages, salaries and/or municipal levies. 
Solvency 
Solvency is the degree to which the total assets of the business cover its total liabilities. 
If an enterprise’s total commitments or liabilities are larger than the value of its total 
assets, it is considered to be insolvent. The reliability of the value of the assets in a 
business is therefore critical in any calculation of solvency.

Ismail Naidoo opened his grocery shop 12 months ago. He inherited the building, 
furniture and equipment from his late uncle (total value R800 000), but had no 
money of his own to buy stock or to pay monthly expenses (excluding rent) for 
six months. All the trade suppliers to his business agreed that he could buy his 
monthly stock (average R100 000) on a 30-day credit basis, but he had to borrow 
the R80 000 needed for monthly operational expenses (multiplied by six months = 
R480 000). His banker only agreed to a R100 000 bank overdraft facility, and he 
had to borrow the other R380 000 from family and friends (who agreed that he 
could repay the loans after 10 years have passed, but required him to pay interest 
monthly). 
Ismail seems to be satisfied now that these 12 months have come to an end. 
The net profit (after paying R72 000 interest) was R200 000, while his own total 
investment was only the building, furniture and equipment (R800 000) and the 
outside capital, worth R580 000 (overdraft 100 000, trade creditors R100 000 and 
long-term loans R380 000).

14.1 LEARNING OUTCOMES 
After you have studied this chapter, you should be able to:  
• defi ne the two primary sources of capital: own capital (equity) and outside capital (foreign, 
borrowed, external) 
• describe the major characteristics of: permanent fi nance and its sources; long-term fi nance 
and its sources; medium-term fi nance and its sources; short-term fi nance and its sources 
• explain what is involved in choosing the applicable sources of fi nance 
• discuss the typical problems experienced by a small business in obtaining fi nance.     
14.2 INTRODUCTION 
The investment decision determines what assets are required to do business successfully. 
The small business entrepreneur/manager must make investment decisions on what 
fi xed assets (land and buildings, machinery and equipment, vehicles and furniture) 
and current assets (cash, stock or inventory and size of the debtors’ book) are required 
by the business. 
In this chapter we will look at the other side of the capital requirement: the fi nancing 
decision. Once you have decided on all the required fi xed and current assets for your 
business, you need to ask yourself a number of important questions. These are:
• How will I be able to acquire these needed assets? 
• How will I be able to afford and pay for these assets? 
• If my (the owner’s) capital is not enough, who will be willing to help me to fi nance 
these assets? 
• Is it wise to use only my own capital or should I also allow other parties to be involved? 
• Are there certain important principles involved in ensuring that I make the right 
fi nancing decisions? 

266

•	 I am sure that some other people may be willing to assist me, but what are their 
requirements and motives? Will it be to my advantage, or theirs? 
•	 Are there specific problems experienced by the average small business entrepreneur/
manager and how can I learn from them? 
In this chapter, we will show you how to find the answers to these questions. 
14.3	 SOURCES OF FINANCE 
The two major sources of finance for a small business are own capital (internal sources) 
and outside capital (external sources). Each of these has its own characteristics, as well 
as advantages, disadvantages and requirements. 
It is important to understand that the words ‘capital’ and ‘finance’ do not necessarily 
refer to physical cash or money. Finance may be cash (in one or another form), but may 
also take the form of an asset supplied, for example when I start my own transport 
business and use my existing paid-up bakkie, the value of this bakkie represents my 
own capital contribution to the business. 
14.3.1		 Own capital (equity) 
Own capital (also known as owner’s capital, shareholders’ funds or owner’s interest 
or equity) is one of the most important sources of finance for a small business. The 
characteristics of own capital are as follows:
•	 Often, it is the first source of capital available to start a new business. 
•	 It is that part of the total capital used in a business that is legally recognised as the 
total value (at a certain point in time) of contributions made by all the legal owners 
of the business. 
•	 It serves as the basis from which other (mostly outside) capital can be attracted. 
•	 Without own capital invested in the small business, it is very unlikely that other 
potential suppliers of capital will be interested in putting money into your business. 
•	 Own capital is permanent. The investment will last as long as the business itself, 
provided that the business is not sold or terminated (although exceptions to this 
rule are possible). 
•	 It is not easy or advisable to withdraw a part of own capital, especially if the business 
is not very solvent and/or not in a highly liquid position or a single proprietorship – 
normally such a step changes the nature of the ownership of the business. 
•	 There are a variety of sources for own capital, including owner’s savings, pension 
payouts and existing owned assets put to use in the business. It may even consist of 

Chapter 14: Financing the capital requirements of a small business
267
unrelated assets (for example, a house or household furniture) that may be sold or 
bonded and changed into cash. 
•	 A person starting a small business does not need to depend solely on his or her own 
contribution to complete the full picture of own capital. 
There are two other supplementary sources of own capital:
•	 If the founder borrows money from someone else in his or her personal capacity 
(and not on behalf of and in the business’s name) and invests it in the business, such 
monies are also considered to be own capital. 
•	 If the founder wishes to bring co-owners (partners, other shareholders) into the 
business, these co-owners may also be additional sources of own capital. 
•	 Another, very important, source to add to the value of own capital is the reinvestment 
of net profit (after tax) as time goes on. 
Vusi, the founder of Vusi’s Engineering Works, had no cash to invest in his business when he 
started it, but he was at that time the proud owner of engineering equipment to the value 
of R80 000 and a delivery vehicle to the value of R60 000. He was also able to convince 
his previous employer to sell additional engineering equipment to him. They agreed that he 
needed only to repay the total value of R100 000 in five years’ time. 
1.	 How much ‘capital’ did Vusi initially ‘invest’ in his new business? Is this own or outside 
capital? 
2.	 How much did Vusi’s previous employer ‘invest’ in the new business? Is this own or out- 
side capital? 
Talk to the owner of any small business that you know, and ask how the business started 
off. Ask the owner to indicate to you the different sources of assets/capital he or she had 
available at the beginning. Find out: the name of the small business, the name of the owner, 
initial assets/capital at start; who supplied these assets?
14.3.2		 Outside capital (foreign, borrowed, external capital) 
As the name suggests, outside capital is finance that comes from sources outside (not 
the owner of) the business. 
A more formal definition is that outside capital is the sum total of all claims by other parties 
(other than the legal owner(s) of a business), who have supplied the business with assets 
and/or cash, and who have not yet been paid in full.

268
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
To understand the nature of outside capital, note the following points:
•	 Outside capital is normally made available to the small business on either a short-, 
medium- or long-term basis. This is different from own capital, which remains in 
the business permanently. 
•	 Outside capital therefore has to be repaid at some time in the future. In contrast, it is 
rare that own capital must be ‘repaid’. 
•	 Suppliers of outside capital are sometimes paid financing fees (for example, in-
terest) as remuneration (reward or payment) for helping to finance the business. 
The exceptions are trade creditors (businesses that supply the small business with 
commercial goods and services on a credit basis). In contrast, the suppliers of own  
capital are normally paid a dividend as remuneration (they also benefit from the 
growth in the value of their investment in the business). 
•	 If the business is liquidated or sold, the suppliers of outside capital normally have 
distinct and preferential claims when it comes to being paid. Normally, staff and the 
Receiver of Revenue and then financiers like hire purchase suppliers and there-after 
trade creditors have first priority. The last parties to be paid (if anything is left) are 
the suppliers of own capital (the owners of the business).

14.4	 FORMS AND SOURCES OF FINANCE 
In Chapter 13, we explained that the capital needs of a small business include fixed 
and current assets. Remember, too, that every small business has a permanent need for 
capital and a variable need for capital. 

Chapter 14: Financing the capital requirements of a small business
269
We also emphasised how important it is to satisfy the need for permanent capital only 
from long-term sources of capital. Similarly, the need for variable capital should be 
satisfied only by using short-term sources of capital. (If you need to review these im-
portant principles, turn back to Chapter 13.) 
The small business entrepreneur/manager must make use of the appropriate forms and 
sources of finance to satisfy these needs and requirements. In this section we will look at 
four forms and sources of finance that are relevant to the small business sector. 
14.4.1		 Permanent finance and its sources 
Normally the only source of permanent finance for a small business is own capital – the 
initial or subsequent investment of the owner’s capital in the business. The only other 
source may be the reinvestment of net profit (after tax) in the form of undistributed 
profits or reserves. There are quite a variety of legal forms of own capital (for example, 
share capital and loan accounts by shareholders). 
Although it is rare to find suppliers of outside capital who are interested in taking up 
shareholding in a viable small business, sources do exist. The former Small Business 
Development Corporation, nowadays known as Business Partners, is one such 
organisation. 
14.4.2		 Long-term finance and its sources 
Long-term finance consists of those monies or goods made available on credit to the 
business for a period of five years and longer (normally not longer than 20 years). 
The major characteristics of long-term finance and its sources are as follows:
•	 Normally a formal written document signed by all parties and drawn up by an 
attorney will spell out the detailed agreement and conditions of agreement between 
the supplier and receiver of such monies or goods.
•	 In most cases, interest has to be paid to the supplier. In the past, it was not 
uncommon to have a fixed interest rate lasting for the full period. Nowadays, the 
interest rate will be linked, for instance, to changes in the prime banking rate and 
will be adjusted accordingly as time goes on.
•	 In most cases, long-term finance will only be made available to the small business if 
it can be directly linked to one or another form of fixed asset. Normally, such a fixed 
asset will also be legally registered as collateral for the amount due to the supplier.

•	 This form of finance will normally be indicated as a long-term loan on a small 
business’s balance sheet.
•	 In some cases, long-term loans may also be supplied by the owners of a business, 
and are not regarded as equity. In these cases, no form of collateral will be required.
•	 In rare cases, other outside parties (such as a family member or a friend) may sup-
ply a long-term loan without expecting or insisting on adequate collateral.
Questions: 
1.	 What are the assets most commonly financed with long-term loans?
2.	 What are the most likely sources of finance for acquiring these assets?
Answers:
1. a.	 land; 
    b.	 buildings;
    c.	 machinery and equipment with a five-years-plus life expectancy
2. a.	 Own capital; banks; other (governmental and private) financial institutions; the seller 
of the asset
    b.	 As in 2a., plus the building contractor him- or herself, demanding from the buyer a 
registered mortgage bond as collateral that the building will be paid. 
    c.	 As in 2a. 
Wealthy private individuals (so-called business angels) may also be possible sources of 
long-term finance for a small business. These are people who are looking for alternative 
investment opportunities. They prefer to invest their capital in local businesses where 
they have a more personal relationship and interest. If the small business grows and 
becomes bigger and more profitable, these investors also expect to be additionally 
remunerated. They may even sometimes wish to become minority co-owners of the 
business!

271
14.4.3		 Medium-term finance and its sources 
Medium-term finance consists of assets and/or monies supplied to the business for 
periods lasting between one and five to seven years. 
The major characteristics of medium-term finance and its sources are as follows:
•	 A written and signed document is usually an integral part of the whole transaction. 
•	 Normally interest will have to be paid by the small business. A variety of forms of 
interest may apply: in some cases, it will be a single, fixed interest rate, in other cases, 
the interest rate may change in direct relation to changes in the official banking rate. 
•	 Regular instalments are used to repay the amount of the initial capital (plus inte-
rest and other finance charges). Instalments may be staggered in equal monthly 
payments for the whole period; sometimes only interest and finance charges must 
be paid monthly, while the capital is repaid only at the end of the period (or every 
six or 12 months). 
It is important to know that the conditions applicable to this type of finance are gene-
rally negotiated and packaged to suit the requirements and circumstances of individual 
businesses. The suppliers of medium-term finance are generally able to offer a wide va- 
riety of options and conditions. 
Even more important to remember is the fact that the small business entrepreneur 
should never blindly accept the initial conditions and demands put forward by the 
willing supplier of goods or capital. The entrepreneur has to make sure that each and 
every condition is (also) to the advantage of the small business. Before signing anything, 
the entrepreneur should negotiate and query all conditions of the credit transaction. 
Renting (or leasing) an asset is also a form of financing. There are a variety of renting/
leasing options, each with its own characteristics and conditions. 
A hire-purchase agreement is also a typical form of medium-term finance. 
Questions: 
1.	 What are the assets most commonly financed with medium-term finance? 
2.	 What are the most likely sources of medium-term finance for acquiring these assets? 
Answers:
1. a.	 machinery and equipment; b vehicles; c furniture 
2. a.	 own capital; banks; other financial institutions; the seller of the asset; private individuals 
    b.	 same as 2a. above 
    c.	 same as 2a. above  
Do

272
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
Another form of medium-term finance, offered by most banks and some specialised fi- 
nancing institutions, is factoring. Factoring takes place when the small business sells 
(as a once-off transaction or even on a monthly basis) its debtors’ book (all or some of 
its debtors’ accounts) to the bank or a specialised financing institution. The latter will 
pay cash for the debtors’ book and will then collect the outstanding monies for itself. 
Remember that any buyer will want to make sure there are no bad debts to be realised. 
Thus the buyer (who is known as the factor) will negotiate to buy the debtors’ book at, 
say, only 60–90% of its invoice or book value. This form of finance is not readily made 
available to most small businesses. 
Visit a branch of one of the well-known banks and ask to speak to a loan officer. Ask this 
person to explain to you the variety of forms of finance that the bank makes available to 
small business. Write down at least five forms of finance and the major characteristics of 
each. 
14.4.4		 Short-term finance and its sources 
Short-term finance is made available to the small business for a period of less than 12 
months. Normally, the specified period of availability is 30 to 90 days (in the case of 
suppliers’ credit) or even 24 hours (a bank overdraft facility may be withdrawn within 
24 hours, although normally it will be available for much longer but may be called up 
if the bank so decides). 
The major characteristics of short-term finance and its sources are as follows:
•	 When short-term goods or services, stock and materials are made available on credit 
terms to a small business, we say that such goods or services are being temporarily 
financed by the suppliers – the suppliers are then considered to be the suppliers of 
short-term finance to the small business. 
•	 Normally, supplier creditors of short-term goods and services (for example, stock 
or inventory) will not charge interest on the outstanding balance owed by the small 
business. However, they may charge a high interest rate in the case of accounts in 
arrears. They may also have a higher pricing policy for goods sold on credit than for 
goods sold for cash, so this may imply an indirect cost to the small business. 
•	 The suppliers of short-term cash loans to the business (banking overdraft facilities 
or loans forwarded by individuals) will normally charge the small business interest. 
•	 Suppliers of short-term goods and services on credit are normally not very strict or 
disciplined in assessing the creditworthiness of their credit purchasing customers. 
This is because they wish to encourage sales, among other reasons. However, they 
may become very strict and unforgiving if and when their trust in a customer proves 
to be unjustified. 
Do

273
•	 Suppliers’ short-term credit is not only restricted to those goods the small business 
owner/manager needs for reselling purposes (which is called stock or inventory). 
Other goods and services needed to facilitate business activities (for example, 
marketing or administration) may also be acquired on a credit basis. 
The term ‘trade creditors’ refers to the credit suppliers of goods and/or services needed 
for reselling purposes (manufacturing works in exactly the same way). The term ‘other 
creditors’ refers to the outstanding monies owed to the suppliers of goods/services 
(other than for manufacturing and/or reselling purposes) that are needed for support 
operations. An example of this is when I required a shop fitter’s services and have to 
pay within 30 days after the work was done.
In some cases, the short-term capital needs of a small business may even be partially 
financed by one or more customers (such as when a customer places an order with a 
manufacturer and pays a deposit at the same time). 
Visit a manufacturer (or a wholesaler) and ask to speak with the credit control officer/
manager. Ask this person to explain to you the variety of credit forms available to small 
business clients when they need short-term assets/services.  
14.5	 CHOOSING SOURCES AND FORMS OF FINANCE 
Over the long term, the small business entrepreneur/manager is responsible for ensu-
ring the optimum added value to the business’s equity. To do this, he or she needs to 
make sure that the specific sources and the specific forms of finance used will contri-
bute to the achievement of this goal. 
This section will look at the critical considerations that must be analysed before each 
financing decision is made. 
14.5.1		 Matching life expectancy of assets and the length of time 
	
	 that credit is available for 
As mentioned in Chapter 13, it is extremely important to match the life expectancy of 
the asset(s) with the length of time for which the source of credit is made available. We 
saw in Chapter 13 that an understanding of a business’s needs for fixed and current 
assets requires an understanding of the needs for permanent and variable capital. 
14.5.2		 Availability and accessibility issues 
In real business situations, it is sometimes not possible for the small business entre-
preneur/manager to follow prudent financial management principles. Sometimes the 
Do

274
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
appropriate sources and forms of finance are not available to a small business (see 
Section 14.6). However, you should take care not to be misled by the easiest source  
and form of availability and accessibility. 
14.5.3		 Costs associated with a specific source
Often small business entrepreneurs/managers are so relieved to find willing sources of 
finance that they completely forget to negotiate the best possible conditions, costs and 
requirements. Always negotiate with suppliers of credit.
14.5.4		 Independence versus dependence and control
One of the strongest motivations for starting a small business is the desire to be 
independent – to initiate your own plans and to do things your own way. However, the 
more outside capital you use in the business, the more your independence is threatened. 
If you don’t have enough own capital resources, a needed piece of equipment will only 
become available if and when you find an outside supplier of finance. The same goes 
for bringing in extra partners or extra shareholders. This strengthens the own capital 
base but also reduces the independence of the small business entrepreneur.
14.5.5		 Freedom of application of finance
Most of the various sources and forms of finance available in the marketplace will only 
be made available to the small business entrepreneur/manager as long as the money is 
used for a specific and predetermined purpose.

275
14.5.6		 The positive and negative effects of the financial leverage 
Financial leverage is related to the cost and use of borrowed capital in the enterprise. If 
the profitability of the enterprise is greater than the interest rate on borrowed capital, an 
increase in profitability of the own capital is caused by the use of borrowed capital. The 
enterprise therefore uses borrowed capital in the hope that it will cause the profitability 
of own capital to rise. This is called a positive financial leverage. 
However, if the interest rate on borrowed capital is greater than the profitability of the 
enterprise, the profitability of own capital is negatively influenced and it drops. This 
factor may even mean that all (and more) of the profits of a business could be absorbed 
by interests to be paid over! This is called a negative financial leverage. 
It is important to stress certain factors:
•	 the relationship (weight) between own and outside capital 
•	 the profitability of the whole small business (its return on investment, or ROI) 
•	 the costs of outside capital compared to the ROI 
•	 the final outcome of profitability as expressed in the return on equity (ROE). 
In the attempt to attract own or outside capital, the small business entrepreneur must 
not forget to work out whether the result of the decision will lead to either a positive or 
negative financial leverage on own capital (ROE). 
14.5.7		 Considerations of liquidity and profitability 
Deciding on the form of finance has a direct impact on the small business’s liquidity and 
profitability. This is closely related to the considerations in sections 14.5.3 and 14.5.6. 
Sometimes over the short term it is wise to forget about profitability issues and to make 
sure that major liquidity threats do not sink the ship – there are many examples of pro-
fitable small businesses that had to close down because of sudden liquidity crises. 
14.5.8		 Taxation considerations 
There are important taxation issues that are relevant to the well-being of a small busi-
ness. For now, remember that almost every decision on the required assets, as well as 
on the sources and forms of finance, has tax implications. 

276

Peter Nkosi buys a vehicle to use in his delivery business. He has three options:
1.	 If he pays cash for the vehicle (using own capital), he will not be able to deduct any 
part of the purchase price from his business’s income for income tax purposes (although 
depreciation, insurance premiums and maintenance costs may be deductible). 
2.	 If he purchases the vehicle on a hire-purchase basis, he may pay a deposit (not de-
ductible) and a monthly instalment (where only the interest and insurance part of the 
instalment and accrued maintenance costs may be deductible, but not the capital down 
payment part of the instalment). 
3.	 If he rents the vehicle without ever becoming the legal owner, the total costs of renting 
may be deductible for income tax purposes.  
14.5.9		 Building long-term relationships 
One of the major strengths of small business owners/managers (compared to very big 
businesses) is their dedication and expertise in building and developing strong and 
relevant networks. This is something to remember and to build on. 
There are many people involved in a small business: the owner(s), relatives and friends, 
bankers, lawyers, suppliers, existing and potential customers, employees, local authori-
ties, the local communities and even staff of the South African Revenue Service. 
The more the small business entrepreneur succeeds in building and developing sound 
relationships with the vast range of constituencies, the more he or she will be able 
to combine the wisdom and strengths of all these resources. If these networks are 
neglected, isolation and ultimate failure may be the result. 
Using your own words, and without looking back at section 14.5, write down at least five 
major things to consider before deciding on the sources and/or forms of finance for your 
business and give your major consideration and motivation for each one.  
14.6	 TYPICAL PROBLEMS IN OBTAINING FINANCE 
Small businesses have certain advantages when compared to big businesses (for exam-
ple, building strong personal relationships and networks). But the size and influence 
of the small business can also be a disadvantage when it comes to obtaining finance. 
This section deals with typical problems experienced by small business entrepreneurs/
managers in their quest for the right sources and forms of finance. 
eg
Do

Chapter 14: Financing the capital requirements of a small business
277
14.6.1		 When own capital’s contribution is too small 
To finance all the assets needed in a business, prudent financial management dictates 
that the contribution of own capital should be at least 50%. In other words, own capital 
should never be less than half of the business’s total capital. 
To start a business, an entrepreneur generally uses all available savings and own capital. 
As the business grows and expands, it creates an increased need for assets (and sources 
of finance to acquire these assets). Because all of the entrepreneur’s savings have been 
used initially to start up, he or she depends more and more on outside capital sources. 
A related problem is that potential suppliers of outside finance also want to know about 
the financial structure of the small business. The smaller the relative portion of own 
capital to total capital, the less willing these suppliers will be to supply additional fund-
ing because they will deem that a higher risk. If they do provide funding, there will 
always be an additional cost to the small business. 
14.6.2		 Lack of experience in financial management 
Normally, the small business entrepreneur will have excellent experience and know-
ledge in a number of disciplines – for example, manufacturing and/or selling and  
marketing and/or in supplying unique goods/services to customers. But very few en-
trepreneurs are also experienced and knowledgeable about financial management. This 
lack of expertise creates difficulties when approaching potential suppliers of needed 
finance, and the entrepreneur may not be able to convince the potential suppliers of 
finance to help him or her. Such owners/managers have to admit this fact and should 
seek assistance in preparing them in this field. 
14.6.3		 Lack of financial expertise in small business 
This problem is related to the lack of experience in financial management but specifi-
cally concerns the running of the business. An entrepreneur who is experienced and 
knowledgeable about, say, marketing and/or manufacturing will tend to be heavily  
involved in these activities. An entrepreneur who does not understand financial man-
agement issues will be more inclined to ignore or skirt these issues. This tendency  
signals great danger for any small business. 
Try to relate the two statements above to an everyday small business operation. Do you 
agree or disagree with these statements? Give two reasons for each answer.  
14.6.4		 Too much emphasis on collateral by suppliers of finance 
Inexperienced small business entrepreneurs/managers may be aware of only some of 
the sources and forms of finance – perhaps only the large national banks and a few other 
Do

278
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
major financial institutions and trade creditors. If they approach only these sources, the 
results can be disappointing. Generally, the first question asked by these suppliers is, 
‘How much collateral can you put up to guarantee your debts?’ Banks in particular are 
often accused of using this quick and easy method of credit assessment. This approach 
is like saying to someone, ‘If you don’t already have an umbrella, I can’t help you get 
one!’ 
Although this is a valid criticism of banks, it is also true that they often have no other 
choice. If the entrepreneur/manager has not done his or her ‘homework’ and chosen 
the right form of finance (see section 14.4), the banker can only accurately assess one of 
the aspects of credit such as collateral. 
14.6.5		 Lack of planning 
The planning function is a big part of business management. The saying, ‘If you fail to 
plan, you plan to fail’ contains a great deal of truth. On the other hand, if you prepare an 
elaborate business plan and then do not implement your plans, you will have wasted of 
lot of energy and other scarce resources. 
Many business textbooks discuss the steps, contents and issues that should be address-
ed in the business plan. Most of these textbooks point out that the major purpose of a 
business plan is to convince potential suppliers of finance to invest in the business or 
supply capital. (Refer to Chapter 5 for the details of a concise business plan.) This is 
true, but remember that the business plan is in the very first and foremost instance also 
supposed to help the entrepreneur/manager to make a success of the business. 
14.6.6		 Creditworthiness 
Just as a small business entrepreneur/manager needs to make a careful analysis to 
determine the creditworthiness of a client, so the suppliers of finance need to analyse 
the strengths and weaknesses of the small business. 
The challenge for the small business entrepreneur/manager is therefore to be very well 
prepared, to have substantiated facts and motivations ready to convince the selected 
source of finance to provide needed capital, and to maintain this trust into the future. 
14.7	 SUMMARY 
In this chapter, we discussed the major issues relating to how a small business’s needs 
for assets should be financed. We emphasised the differences between own and outside 
sources and forms of finance. In direct relation to these issues, we examined the various 
sources and forms of permanent and variable finance available in the marketplace. 
These include permanent, long-term, medium-term and short-term finance.

15.1 LEARNING OUTCOMES 
After you have studied this chapter, you should be able to:  
• indicate some of the important things to consider in starting a new business 
• indicate, explain and illustrate the three pieces of information required to calculate the break-
even point 
• calculate the break-event point using the break-even formulae 
• explain the break-even concept using a graph 
• assess the impact on the break-even point when any one of the three critical elements 
changes 
• explain the advantages and disadvantages of the break-even analysis.     
15.2  INTRODUCTION 
The small business entrepreneur/manager must answer many important questions 
when considering starting a new venture. Some of these questions are:
• At what cost prices will I be able to acquire the products and services I intend to sell 
to the market? 
• At what selling prices will I be able to convince potential customers to buy from me 
instead of from my competition? 
• Apart from the actual cost prices of the products and services, what other basic costs 
will I have to incur in order to be able to buy and sell these products and services? 
• How can I know, in advance, how many products I need to buy and sell in order to 
realise a satisfactory profi t fi gure? 
• After I have started the business, if there is a change in one or more of my cost 
prices/expenses, how will that infl uence the quantity of products and services and 

Chapter 15: The break-even analysis
281
their monetary value that I need to sell in order to realise the same profit as before? 
(This question is also relevant whenever a change may occur in the selling prices 
and/or the other basic costs/expenses of business operations, like an increase in 
rental to be paid or higher wages and salaries agreed on.) 
In this chapter, we will answer these questions by looking at very basic and realistic 
everyday business examples, in order to learn about and understand the issues relating 
to the break-even analysis. 
15.3	 CRITICAL ASPECTS OF STARTING A BUSINESS 
In this section we will review some of the factors that must be considered before starting 
a small business. To do this, let us look at a practical example. 
Mary Khoza is a second-year university student and needs to supplement her income. 
Because she is good at making hamburgers for herself and her friends, she is considering 
opening up a hamburger stall on weekends at one of the popular flea markets near the 
campus. 
What do you think are the most important things to consider when starting a new business? 
What does Mary need to look at to decide whether her weekend hamburger stall will be 
viable or not? List at least ten things she will need to investigate.  
Here are a few of the factors Mary will have to consider:
•	 Location: Is there a site available at the nearest flea market? How much will the rent 
per day be? What about alternative flea markets? 
•	 Competition: Are there other suppliers of hamburgers at (or near) the flea market? 
At what price do they sell their hamburgers? How many hamburgers do they sell 
on an average weekend day? 
•	 Equipment: What kind of equipment will be needed at the flea market site to make 
and sell hamburgers? Is this equipment available on a rental basis or will Mary have 
to buy it all herself? 
•	 Ingredients: Mary needs to make a list of all the ingredients required to make her 
Super-Duper special hamburger (for example, meat, spices, rolls, sauces). It is also 
very important that she calculates exactly what the ingredient costs will be per ham-
burger. 
•	 Salary and wages: A basic principle of small business management is that the profit 
to the business and the salary/remuneration of the entrepreneur are two different 
eg

282
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
things. An entrepreneur who operates and manages his or her own business should 
pay him- or herself a competitive, market-related salary. This is part of the overall ex- 
penses of the business. Profit is always calculated after all business expenses are 
deducted from income. Mary should therefore make provision for her own market-
related remuneration. And if business is good, she may need to employ an assistant. 
She will then also have to work out how much to pay her assistant. 
•	 Marketing: It is not enough to have an excellent product or service – you have to be 
able to inform, invite and convince the target market about your product or service 
and make it easy for customers to buy it. These activities are part of marketing. Mary 
will need to market her hamburgers in an efficient and effective way, otherwise her 
business will not be a success. 
Mary’s investigations, inquiries and negotiations had the following results:
•	 Site: Mary can rent an exclusive site, situated close to where visitors enter the flea 
market, at a daily rate for Saturdays and Sundays of R1 600 (payable in cash on the 
preceding Monday). 
•	 Selling price: There is one other existing regular competitor in the flea market, sel- 
ling hamburgers at R25 each. Mary reckons that she will do well in selling her 
Super-Duper special hamburgers at the same price. She couldn’t find out how many 
hamburgers this competitor sells, but the landlord reckons that an average of 5 000 
people visit the flea market per weekend day. 
•	 Equipment: After investigating many alternatives, Mary determined that the best 
option was to rent a fully equipped trailer, custom-made for a hamburger stall, with 
all the gas bottles, utensils, signboards, etc. The daily rent is R400 and is payable one 
week in advance. 
•	 Wages: Mary reckons that a market-related daily wage for herself could be R900 
(R90 per hour for 10 hours). Her younger sister is willing to assist her for R300 per 
day (R30 per hour for ten hours). Her sister expects to be paid this figure whatever 
the quantity of hamburgers (zero or 1 000) they sell per day. 
•	 Ingredients: After many hours of experimenting, measuring and calculating, Mary 
worked out that the total cost price of all the ingredients needed in one hamburger 
is exactly R10. This includes bread rolls, meat patties, butter, mustard, onions, salt 
and pepper, lettuce, as well as her ‘mystery’ Super-Duper sauce mixture. Packaging 
is also included. 
•	 Marketing: The owner of the trailer rental business introduced Mary to a market-
ing consultant. After weighing many possibilities, Mary accepted the consultant’s 
advice to put a large sign on top of the trailer to make the stall visible from far away. 
The total cost of this permanent sign is R2 000. 

Chapter 15: The break-even analysis
283
•	 Transport: After considering all relevant aspects, Mary worked out that her transport 
and communication costs will be R80 per day. 
A very important question (relevant to any business venture) needs to be asked and 
needs to be answered well: How many hamburgers must Mary sell per day to cover all 
her costs (not making any loss or profit)? 
15.4	 THE BREAK-EVEN POINT 
Now that Mary has worked out what she needs to start her hamburger stall, she needs 
to calculate how many hamburgers she must sell each day to cover all her costs. The 
answer to this question is called the break-even point. 
The break-even point of a business can be defined as the level of business where neither 
a profit nor a loss is realised, the level where the income from sales is equal to the total 
operational costs (including the owner’s remuneration) of the enterprise.     
At this point the business is neither making any profit nor realising any loss. It is break-
ing even – no profit, no loss. 
How many units must Mary sell per day to break even? To answer this question, we 
need three pieces of information or critical factors:
(a)	The selling price of a single product/service: Mary will sell her hamburgers for R25 
each. 
(b)	The direct cost price of a single product/service: This relates to all the costs directly 
incurred in acquiring/manufacturing/buying a single product. In Mary’s case this 
will be R10, representing the accumulated cost prices of all the ingredients needed 
to make one Super-Duper special hamburger. 
(c)	The total indirect costs of the business: This covers all other costs necessary to ope- 
rate a business. In Mary’s case, these daily costs are: the rental of a site (R1 600), the 
rental of the custom-made trailer (R400), and wages paid (R900 + R300 = R1 200) as 
well as transport and communications R80 per day. Added together this amounts to 
R3 280 per day. The marketing sign of R2 000 needs a little more explanation. All the 
other costs (wages, rental of site and trailer) are daily costs, but the marketing sign 
will last say at least one year – its life expectancy is deemed to be one year. Its daily 
cost can therefore be calculated as follows: R2 000 divided by 100 weekend days per 
year and this gives a daily cost of R20 for marketing/advertising costs. Thus the 
total indirect costs to Mary’s business are R3 300 per day. 
D

284

15.4.1		 Using the break-even formula 
The following formula can be used to answer the question of how many hamburgers 
Mary must sell per day in order to break even: 
total indirect costs
selling price per unit less direct costs per unit
This gives: Number of hamburgers to be sold per day to break even
Thus: 
R3 300
 R25  – R10
= 220 hamburgers must be made and sold per day to break even 
Mary needs to sell 220 hamburgers per day in order to break even (making neither a 
profit nor loss). If she is going to sell more, she will make a profit. If she is unable to sell 
220 on a specific day, she will make a loss. 
Verifying your answer 
How can you be sure that you have correctly calculated the break-even point? 
You can verify the answer by answering the following questions: 
•	 How much will Mary’s total income be if she sells 220 hamburgers at a selling price 
of R25 each? (Answer: 220 × R25 = R5 500) 
•	 How much will her total direct costs be when making and selling 220 hamburgers at 
R10 direct cost price per hamburger? (Answer: 220 × R10 = R2 200) 
•	 How much are her total indirect costs (excluding total direct costs) to operate the 
business? (Answer: R400 for trailer rental plus R1 600 for site rental plus R20 for 
advertising plus R1 200 for wages, plus R80 for transport and communications = 
R3 300) 
	
So:	
Total income 	 =	
R5 500
	
Less: 	 Direct costs	
=	
R2 200
	
Less: 	 Indirect costs 	 =	
R3 300
	
Gives:	 Profit (loss) 	
=	
R0 000 
Remember that you cannot calculate the break-even point without any of the following 
three pieces of information:
(i)	 selling price per unit 
(ii)	 direct cost price per unit
(iii)	total indirect costs of business operation. 

Chapter 15: The break-even analysis
285
15.5	 OTHER FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS 
Now that you understand what is meant by the break-even point, let us look at some 
other important concepts in financial management. First we will examine terms we have  
used already in our calculation of the break-even point, namely indirect costs (or over-
heads) and direct costs. We will then discuss marginal income. 
15.5.1		 Overheads 
Overheads (also called indirect costs, operational costs or fixed costs) are those costs, 
other than the direct costs (see section 15.5.2), that are unavoidable in business. Normally,  
overheads consist of the costs of facilities and resources that enable the entrepreneur/
manager to do business. 
Typical examples of overheads are:
•	 rent paid for business premises and equipment 
•	 wages and salaries paid to yourself and other employees 
•	 monies paid for marketing campaigns, insurance instalments and fees for local au-
thority services. 
Overheads are mostly relatively fixed (site rental will be fixed but Water and Electricity 
may vary a bit between two extremes) and whether you sell many products and services 
per month or nothing at all, these expenses still have to be incurred. Overheads are an 
essential part of doing business, but cannot be related directly to the individual cost 
price of a product unit. These costs are, however, indirectly related to all products. 
If we look at Mary’s hamburger stall, a useful way of determining whether a cost is direct 
or indirect is to ask (and answer) the following question: If she sells no hamburgers, 
will this cost be more or less? For example, if she sells 1 000 hamburgers, will that cost 
be more or less?
Mary will pay R2 000 for the advertising sign. She has to pay this money to the sign-
writer whether she sells one hamburger or 1 000. The same applies to the R400 rental 
for the trailer, the R1 600 rental for her site as well as the R900 needed for wages or the 
R80 for transport and communications. All these costs are therefore regarded as indirect 
costs (overheads). 
Indirect costs are the costs (expenses) incurred in order to do business regardless of whether 
one or 1 000 items are sold.    
In our example of Mary’s hamburger stall, the costs of renting the site, renting the trailer, 
and paying for the sign and the obligation to pay wages to her sister are fixed. Whether 
she sells one or 1 000 hamburgers per day, she will still have to pay these costs in full. 
D

286
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
In business, fixed costs are fixed only for particular periods of time. For example, after 
a period of time (for example, 12 months), the rent on the premises may be raised or 
employees may demand higher salaries. If sales increases require more employees, the 
fixed cost of wages will change as well. 
Overheads (fixed costs, indirect costs, operational costs) are committed, unavoidable 
costs that have no direct relation to the volume of sales. If sales are low, the fixed costs 
will still be incurred. If sales rise, fixed costs will still be the same (up to a certain point, 
of course). 
15.5.2		 Direct costs 
Direct costs (also called variable costs or cost of sales or manufacturing costs) are the 
direct, exclusive costs (expenses) incurred to acquire (or to manufacture) products/
services. For a retailer, direct costs normally consist of the cost price of a product the 
retailer pays to the supplier/wholesaler of the product/service. For a manufacturer, 
direct costs normally consist of the accumulated cost prices of all the raw materials 
(ingredients) and the direct labour cost used in manufacturing a specific product. 
Mary calculated the combined cost of all the ingredients needed to make one Super-
Duper special hamburger at R10 per hamburger. If customers do not order a single 
hamburger, Mary will accrue no direct costs in making the hamburgers. If she sells 200 
hamburgers, the variable cost to the business that day will be 200 x R10 = R2 000. 
Thus we can see that direct costs are directly related to the volume of sales. If sales 
volume is low, direct costs will be low; if sales volume increases, the direct cost will 
directly increase proportionally as well. 
In real life, Mary might consider making hamburgers beforehand, so building up an 
inventory in advance of the flea market (but this then will bring many other aspects to 
the front: for example keeping them ‘fresh’, transport, not to over- or under-produce, 
etc.) 
Direct costs are those costs directly incurred and directly related to acquiring a single product/
service. The accumulated direct costs are called the cost of sales (or cost of manufacturing).  
15.5.3		 Marginal income 
Marginal income (also more commonly called gross profit) represents the positive 
difference between the selling price per unit minus the direct cost price per unit. 
In Mary’s case, R25 less R10 gives R15 per unit marginal income. This means that for 
each hamburger sold at R25, R10 is needed to pay for ingredients (direct costs) while 
the R15 marginal income contributes to the payment of the indirect costs (overheads, 
D

Chapter 15: The break-even analysis
287
fixed or operational costs). Once the total indirect costs have been defrayed (covered) by 
this marginal income, the business starts to make a profit. If the accumulated marginal 
income is not enough to cover the total overheads, the result will be a net loss. 
Marginal income percentage (gross profit percentage) 
Whenever marginal income (gross profit) of a product is expressed as a percentage, it 
is calculated either as a percentage in relation to the selling price or to the cost price of 
that product. In Mary’s case: 
Gross profit percentage	 = gross profit × 100
 selling price
	
= R15 × 100
 R25
 
	
= 60% gross profit percentage 
This means that for every R1 sales, 60 cents are realised as gross profit. 
Gross profit percentage is different from the mark-up percentage, which is the percent-
age a small business entrepreneur will add to the cost price of a product in order to 
arrive at that product’s selling price. The markup percentage is therefore calculated 
where the marginal income (gross profit) of a product is expressed in relation to the cost 
price of that product. 
In Mary’s case: 
Markup percentage	 = 
gross profit × 100
 cost price of the procuct/service
	
= R15 × 100
 R10
 
	
= 150% markup percentage 
This means that for every R1 invested in direct costs (acquiring or manufacturing a 
product), R1,50 is added to arrive at the selling price. 
Question: 
We can now ask the second big question: How many hamburgers must Mary sell if she 
wishes to make a net profit of, say, R1 000 per day? After all, she is not in business to break 
even, but to make a profit! 
Answer: 
The same three pieces of information are required. We need to know Mary’s selling price 
per unit, her direct cost price per unit and her total indirect costs per day. Now add Mary’s 
required net profit to her indirect costs and then recalculate the ‘new’ break-even point, 
which now includes profit desired.
➠
Do

288
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
The formula now is:  
total indirect costs + required profit
selling price per unit – direct cost per price 
In Mary’s case:  R3 300 + R1 000
R25 – R10
 
	
=	 4 300
15
	
=	 286.67 hamburgers to be made and sold
So she must sell 287 hamburgers in order to make R1 000 net profit per day.
Verifying your answer 
Once again it is quite easy (and also a good idea) for you to check whether the answer 
of 286.67 hamburgers is correct. 
All you have to do is to answer the following questions:
•	 How much will Mary’s total income be if she sells 286.67 hamburgers at R25 each? 
(Answer: 286.67 × R25 = R7 166.67) 
•	 How much will her total direct costs be when making and selling 286.67 hamburgers 
at a direct cost price of R10 per hamburger? (Answer: 286.67 × R10 = R2 866.67) 
•	 How much are the total indirect costs (excluding total direct costs) involved in 
operating Mary’s business? (Answer: R3 300. This is unchanged because these costs 
are still the same: R400 for trailer rental, R1 600 for site rental plus R20 per day for 
the marketing sign plus R1 200 for wages and R80 for transport and communications 
per day.)
	
So: 	
Total income 	 R7 166.67
	
Less: 	
Direct costs 	 R2 866.67 
	
Less: 	
Indirect costs 	R3 300
	
Gives: 	 Net profit 	
R1 000 
15.6	 CALCULATING THE BREAK-EVEN POINT IN TERMS OF 
	
	 MONETARY SALES VOLUME 
When we know the marginal income percentage (or, in other words, the gross profit 
percentage) of a business, we can use the following formula to indicate its break-even 
point in monetary sales volume: 
total indirect cost × 100
 gross profit percentage

Chapter 15: The break-even analysis
289
Thus in Mary’s case:
R3 300 × 100
 60
= R5 500 monetary sales required daily to break even (220 hamburgers at R25 selling 
price each) 
This formula may also be used to calculate the needed monetary volume of sales in 
order to realise a given net profit. The required profit must first be added to the total 
indirect costs. 
In Mary’s case, if she wants a profit of R1 000, this will be:
total indirect cost + required profit
 gross profit percentage
= (R3 300 + R1 000) × 100
 60
 
=	R7 166,67 sales required per day to arrive at R1 000 net profit (286.67 hamburgers at
	 R25 selling price each) 
R5 500 in monetary sales is required to break even (220 hamburgers at R25 selling price each). 
And R7 166,67 income is required for Mary to realise R1 000 net profit (286.67 hamburgers 
at R25 each). 
15.7	 USING A GRAPH TO EXPLAIN THE BREAK-EVEN POINT 
15.7.1		 Indirect costs 
The total indirect (fixed, operational) costs of a business remain the same regardless of  
the sales volume of the enterprise. It does not make a difference whether one or 1 000  
items are sold. For Mary’s hamburger stall, we can see this clearly on the graph in  
Figure 15.1 below.

15.7.2		 Direct costs 
The direct (variable) costs needed to purchase (or to manufacture) a single product 
vary according to the volume of sales. If Mary makes and sells only one hamburger, 
her direct costs will only be R10; if she makes and sells 1 000 hamburgers, her direct 
costs will increase in direct relation to the increase in sales volume, thus 1 000 × R10 = 
R10 000. 
In Mary’s case, we can show this on a graph as depicted in Figure 15.2.

15.8	 ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF THE BREAK- 
	
	 EVEN ANALYSIS 
The break-even analysis is an extremely essential and useful tool for the small business 
entrepreneur/manager. There are no real disadvantages to it, although it can be mis-
understood, for example:
•	 Sometimes it is not easy to draw the exact line between direct and indirect costs. For 
example, if you make a phone call to order a product, should this cost be calculated 
as a direct cost in acquiring the product? And how?
•	 The elements affecting the direct cost price per unit, as well as those making up the 
total indirect costs of a business are not constant but may change continuously. 
•	 Most new businesses will not be in a position to initially realise a profit – in normal 
conditions, a retail business will take up to nine months to get to their break-even 
point and then to go beyond that to earn net profits thereafter. 
In spite of these problems, doing the break-even analysis is necessary for successful 
financial management. Profit is realised by calculating income less direct costs, less in-
direct costs. Unless all three of these critical elements are continually measured, calcu-
lated and managed, the achievement of the business’s objectives will be endangered. 
The aim of business is to make a profit and the small business entrepreneur needs to 
make sure this is achieved. 
When something is not measured, it cannot be managed. And the better something is 
measured, the better it can be managed!  
15.9	 CHANGES TO THE THREE CRITICAL FACTORS 
Any change to one (or more) of the three critical factors in the profit analysis will have 
a very important impact on the profitability of the business. Price changes (in selling 
prices, direct cost prices and changes in direct cost) are common in business, and the 
entrepreneur/manager must have a sound knowledge and understanding of these 
changes at all times. In Mary’s case, the following three scenarios illustrate the impact 
of such changes. 
15.9.1		 If the selling price per unit changes 
As an example of this, if the selling price is raised to R30 per unit, what will be the new 
break-even point? 
total indirect costs
 selling price per unit less direct costs per unit
NB

292
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
=	
R3 300
 R30 – R10
=	
R3 300
 R20
=	 165 hamburgers needed to be sold in order to break even
So Mary now needs to sell only 165 hamburgers in order to break even (instead of 220 
when the selling price was R25 each). 
15.9.2		 If indirect costs change 
If any or more indirect costs increase, for example, the landlord raises the site rental to 
R2 000 (previously R1 600) and the trailer company raises the trailer rental to R600 a day 
(previously R400), the break-even point will be: 
	
R3 900
 R25 – R10 	
	
=	 R3 900
 R15
=	 260 hamburgers 
So Mary will now have to sell 260 hamburgers (previously 220) in order to break even. 
15.9.3		 If the direct costs per unit change 
Say, for instance, that the cost price of the ingredients of the hamburger increases from 
R10 to R12. The new break-even point will be: 
	
R3 300
 R25 – R12 	
	
=	 R3 300
 R13
=	 253.85 hamburgers 
So Mary now has to sell 254 hamburgers (previously 220) for her hamburger stall to 
break even. 
You can see that any change in any one or more of the three factors influencing the 
break-even point has a direct impact on the profit, loss or break-even results of the 
business. Each of these factors must be monitored on a continuous basis. 
15.10  BUT THE BUSINESS INTENT IS TO MAKE A PROFIT! 
One must remember that actually the intent of business is to make a satisfactory profit 
over the longer term (and not to break even). But it is only after the break-even point 

Chapter 15: The break-even analysis
293
is reached that the business will start showing profits. It is therefore very important to 
continuously calculate the break-even point and to ensure the business volumes will 
continuously be beyond that point! The further a business’s sales are beyond its break-
even point, the bigger net profit is earned for each Rand’s sales beyond that point, as 
gross profit then becomes net profit. 
15.11  SUMMARY 
In this chapter, we looked at the importance and the critical elements of the break-even 
analysis. You learnt that the entrepreneur has to identify three critical things in order 
to do the break-even analysis: the selling price per unit, the direct costs to acquire or to 
manufacture the unit and the total costs of indirect but necessary operational activities. 
By using the example of Mary’s hamburger stall, we identified many issues that an 
entrepreneur/manager must consider. You learnt the important difference between 
direct and indirect costs, and this was applied to Mary’s business. By using this data, 
two different formulae were used to calculate Mary’s break-even point, both in terms 
of number of units that had to be sold and also in terms of the monetary sales income 
Mary requires. We stressed that you should always verify the calculation of the break-
even point. 
Lastly, we looked at how the break-even point changes when one (or more) of the three 
critical elements changes. The important thing to keep in mind is the need to recalculate 
the break-even point continually. 
Remember: When something is not measured, it cannot be managed. And the better 
something is measured, the better it can be managed!

16.1 LEARNING OUTCOMES 
After you have studied this chapter, you should be able to:  
• give reasons for items included in your budget 
• distinguish between the various components used to compile a master budget 
• draw up the budgeted income statement and balance sheet 
• draw up the cashfl ow budget 
• draw conclusions and make decisions on the basis of the completed budgets 
• compare actual costs with budgeted costs and use it as a tool for management decisions. 
16.2 INTRODUCTION 
Whether you are budgeting your time or your available funds, everyone uses a budget 
in one way or another. Budget formats may vary from one organisation to the next but 
the principles remains the same. For a business to be successful, strategic planning for 
the following year needs to be done and these plans need to be put on paper by doing 
budgets. The enterprise needs to identity what actions will be necessary to achieve the 
budgeted sales. The budget process can either be done from the setting of a required 
margin and how you would achieve it (known as top down approach) or starting with 
a zero base and estimate the sales and expenses from there. 
A budget is a written document that expresses management’s goals and forecasts in 
fi nancial terms for a specifi c future period. It constitutes of a fi nancial plan and estimation 
for a future period.    
D

296
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
16.3 WHY DO WE DRAW UP BUDGETS?
A budget provides a formal framework for an enterprise to make forecasts and set goals. 
• A budget is an instrument that allows management and staff to evaluate whether 
goals have been achieved. By allowing comparisons between actual results and 
budgeted results, it aids in fi nancial control. 
• Budgets also serve as an aid to fi nancial planning. For example, the budgeting process 
gives the entrepreneur a chance to determine the capital requirements of the business. 
The business can then make provision for its fi nancing needs at an early stage. 
• Budgets create cost awareness among staff. They are used to control costs in the 
business. They can also show where possible problems could arise in the future. 
• Budgets coordinate the goals of the business, and contribute to the effective use of 
the resources at the business’s disposal. 
• Budgets give the business the opportunity to take external factors into account – for example, 
competition and economic cycles – that can infl uence it during fi nancial planning. 
16.3.1  When and for what period is a budget drawn up? 
Budgets are drawn up a reasonable time before the end of the fi nancial year, to be ready 
for the following year, when they will come into effect. The budgeting process involves 
collecting necessary information from all the various components of the business and 
processing it. A medium to large enterprise will have its budget ready in September for 
the following 12-month period from January to December. 
To put it simply, a budget is merely a set of goals that is converted into fi gures. In 
this chapter we will look at the process involved in translating goals into fi gures. The 
budgeting circle (Figure 16.1) is a diagram of how budgeting works.

16.4 MASTER BUDGET 
A master budget is compiled from a number of different budgets – each drawing on 
different components of the business. 
Sales expenditure
Research on the business 
environment, plans and 
sales forecast
Production budget
Sales budget
Administration and 
overhead costs budget
Labour budget
Materials budget
Capital expenditures 
budget (including 
equipment)
Financial budget

Profi t budget
Figure 16.2: Components of a master budget
All information contained in the budgets must be based on challenging but realistic 
goals. Thorough research must be done on existing situations – for example, current 
sales and growth in the market – before a budget can be drawn up. 
A budget will only work and be applied effectively if all interested parties in the 
business (such as sales people) are consulted in the process. It is important that the 
budget also contain their inputs. In a small business, the owner usually has knowledge 
of all levels of activity in the business. 
When a budget is reasonable and realistic, it motivates staff to attempt to reach the goals 
set. Conversely, an unreasonable and unrealistic budget will have a negative infl uence 
on the staff. 
The fi rst budget that must be completed is the sales budget. 
16.5 SALES BUDGET 
The important thing to remember is that you can draw up the sales budget only if you 
have already determined your sales forecast. 

298
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
The sales forecast is an estimate or prediction of the expected sales of the enterprise for a 
future period.     
Forecasting takes good working knowledge of your business and you, as the small 
business entrepreneur, can forecast or estimate better than any device or statistical 
analysis. First do some research to confirm your instinct on sales or add to your current 
knowledge of expected sales. The basis of a sales budget is to break the expected sales 
down into manageable parts. 
Estimate the sales by:
•	 individual project/product or item 
•	 month per month for a period of one year. 
Add up the sales lines to get total sales per product or project for the year. 
Months can be added together to get the total sales for a specific month. When you are 
doing a sales forecast in components, it is easier to establish later which sales were not 
achieved, the number of units sold or price difference per unit sold against budget. The 
sales budget can also be drawn up for shorter periods – especially in the case where 
sales can fluctuate drastically from month to month. The small business enterprise 
should review the sales forecast on a monthly basis so that it is in a position to make 
swift adjustments if necessary. The sales forecast is the point of departure for the sales 
and other budgets. 
The sales budget is regarded as one of the most important budgets because it has an 
influence on so many other budgets. Here is an example of a sales budget:

The basic calculations are as follows: 
Step 1: Determine the expected sales 
Expected sales = expected number of units sold × unit price 
If you have determined that you are going to sell 20 000 units with a value of R40 per 
unit for the following month, your sales are 20 000 × R40 = R800 000. This amount will 
be used for the profit and loss budget. 
D

Chapter 16: Budgets
299
Step 2: Determine the expected cash collection 
For the cashflow forecast, we need to determine the cash collection during the period. If 
the company sells on credit, cash is received over a specific period usually established 
by past trends and the effectiveness of the debt collection process. These amounts can 
be determined as follows:
•	 For sales of R800 000, 20% will be cash and 80% will be on credit. The credit sales 
will be collected as follows: 60% in the month following the purchase (30 days) and 
40% in the next month (60 days).

We have drawn up the annual budget for Shop-a-Trade, a company selling umbrellas 
printed with the names of companies (see Table above). The following information was 
collected: 
•	 After thorough research, the owners determined that expected sales would be 3 000 
units for the first quarter, later increasing by 500 units per quarter.
•	 The selling price would remain constant for the year at R60.

300
Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
•	 60% of sales were for cash and 40% were on credit.
•	 Debtors would pay 30 days after purchase.
•	 The outstanding debts of R65 000 at the beginning of the year should all be collected 
in the first period.
The sales budget for Shop-a-Trade appears on the previous page.
The sales budget can be divided up by shop or region or salesperson.
You are asked to draw up the sales budget of Manufacturer (Pty) Ltd. The company sells 
sewing machines that are in reasonable demand. The following information must be taken 
into account: 
•	 Sales for the next year will increase from the second quarter by 15% and 10% for every 
quarter thereafter. The sales for the current year are 3 100 units per quarter. Selling price 
per unit is R500, and this will increase by 10% in the third quarter.
•	 Cash sales amount to 50%.
•	 Manufacturer’s outstanding debtors amount to R85 000, of which 50% is collected in 
period 1 and 50% in period 2. Debtors usually pay 60% in the first period after sales 
and 40% in the second period after sales.

Now that you know how much you can sell, you must calculate how many units you 
must manufacture. Here you must take into account the stock you already possess, as 
well as what you want to retain. The calculation will therefore be as follows:
expected number of sales – opening stock + final stock = expected number of units to manufacture
If the expected sales are 200 000, opening stock is 50 000 and final stock is estimated 
at 70 000 (to have enough stock on the shelves to sell), what is the expected number of 
units that you must manufacture?
200 000 – 50 000 + 70 000 = 220 000 units
It is important that the business carry the right amount of stock. If too much stock is 
carried, it can lead to liquidity problems and the dismissal of staff. If too little stock is 
carried, it can lead to loss of sales. 
Suppose the owners of Shop-a-Trade have decided that they want to manufacture 
15% of a future quarter’s stock in the preceding quarter and have it on the shelves 
in advance. (This is their stock of finished products.) We can now calculate what the 
opening and final stock must be for each quarter. 
Opening stock (15% × 3 000) = 450 units 
Closing stock (15% × 3 500) = 525 units
•	 Direct material costs are R4.90 per unit. 
•	 Direct material purchases are paid 50% cash in the quarter of purchase and 50% in 
the following quarter (30 days). Accounts payable of R11 500 at the beginning of the 
year will be paid in full in the first quarter.

The production budget shows a close relationship to the sales budget since enough 
stock must be produced to meet the demand for goods.
Complete the production budget for Manufacturer. Opening stock amounts to 25% of 
expected sales. Closing stock must be 25% of the following period’s sales:
•	 Manufacturer pays for its materials 50% in cash in the quarter of sales, 60% of the 
creditors in the following quarter and the outstanding 40% in the second quarter 
following the sales. 
•	 Manufacturer’s outstanding accounts at the beginning of the period were R42 000 and 
this is paid equally over the following two periods. 
•	 Material costs are R5 per unit.

Chapter 16: Budgets
303
If a small business does not produce goods but buys and sells goods, it must draw up 
a purchases budget. The number of products that must be purchased is determined 
in the same way as the number of products that need to be manufactured. You must 
therefore determine the quantity that must be purchased for each quarter. After the 
purchases budget, you immediately complete your cashflow budget (see section 16.10 
in this chapter). 
16.7	 LABOUR BUDGET 
It is necessary to draw up a labour budget to determine the need for human resources, 
and how much they will cost. Without a labour budget, you might find that you do not 
have enough staff to complete the required production within the given timeframe. A 
labour budget will also assist you in managing your cashflow with regards to salaries 
and wages. 
Your step-by-step process will be as follows: 
1.	 determine how many units do you want to make (refer back to production budget)
2.	 how long will each unit take to manufacture (per hour/per day?)
3.	 multiply it with the labour cost per hour/per day.
Shop-a-Trade manufactures umbrellas, and it takes two hours of labour per umbrella 
(unit) at an average wage of R10 an hour.

16.8	 BUDGETED INCOME STATEMENT
Expense budgets for larger entities can be drawn up for every department. Such an 
expense budget is then assigned to the person responsible for that department or 
specific expense line and must control and authorise all expenses against that specific 
department. There are different methods to budget for expense items, similar to the 
functional budgets:
•	 start from a zero base and recalculated all expenses due in the next year
•	 review the previous year’s expenses and use it as a base, and increase or decrease 
the new expenses depending on the business plan
•	 use the previous year’s expenses and do an inflationary increase to all expense items
•	 the budgeted income statement is an important summary of all the previous 
budgets that have been completed. It therefore also indicates the expected profit for 
the following period. Since the income statement is a summary of all the previous 
budgets, it also serves as an excellent way to evaluate actual results against budgeted 
results.
Shop-a-Trade had the following expenses in the preceding year and wants to make 
provision for an adjustment for inflation of 12% for the coming year:
Rent paid
	
R50 000

16.10  CASHFLOW BUDGET 
Let us say you have done the forecast profit and loss calculation. The difference between 
the forecast profit and loss and the cashflow is that you concentrate on when you will 
receive cash and when cash payments are made. The cashflow budget is the main lifeline 
of the business and is the most important result of drawing up the other budgets. The 
cashflow budget indicates the expected flow of cash and can help management plan 
to make early provision for cash shortages and to consider the necessary financing 
possibilities. This allows cash planning to take place, and any excess cash can be 
invested. 
You have bought a vehicle for R100 000. This amount will appear in the cashflow budget 
as an outflow (expense). But in the balance sheet it will be capitalised and depreciation 
will be written off in the income statement.  
The cashflow statement does not take into account non-cash items, such as depreciation 
and bad debts.

16.11  COMPILING MORE DETAILED BUDGETS
We have discussed the basic concepts of the budgeting process. However it might be 
necessary to do detailed analysis of an expense line in order to justify the increase in 
spending and be able to track the spending later in the year. Here is an example of a 
detail marketing budget.
Here is a an annual budget with supporting reasons for the marketing expenses with the 
objective for 20X6: Increase opportunities through marketing efforts. Direct marketing 
opportunities include phone calls, emails, website registrations and referrals.

Budgets can also be compiled by sections or departments in a company instead of pro-
cesses. The following is an example of a marketing budget monthly expenses broken 
down in the different type of expenses. The more detailed the budget is that you submit 
together with the purpose of the expenses included in the budget, the easier the budget 
will be for non-financial people to understand. You will note the following budget is for 
R13.3 million (numbers rounded to R’000) for the whole department including salaries.

16.12  FINANCIAL FORECAST
Budgets can also be drawn up on the basis of financial forecasts. This method relies on 
relationships and forecasts that are based on past data and trends.
Advertising costs have increased by 12% per year in the last five years, and amounted 
to R20 000 last year. What will next year’s current expenditure be if you do a trend 
forecast?
R20 000 × 112% = R22 400
The following income statement for the past two years is available to you.
Sales for the coming year are estimated to be 20% more than the current year.
Current expenses are expected to follow the latest trend. Other income will remain constant. 
Interest paid will increase to R20 000 because of the new long-term loan that has been 
negotiated. All the other costs will remain in the same proportion to sales. Tax rate for the 
next year will amount to 30%. Now complete the budgeted income statement.

16.13  ACTUAL AGAINST BUDGET
An important control measure when budgeting is to measure the actual costs against 
the budgeted costs. This allows you to exercise control over the budget and cashflow.
When actual costs are set against budgeted costs, as is done at a given time, reasons 
must be given for any deviation from budget. This allows the business to establish pos-
sible lack of control over in certain areas. Feedback and accountability of from these 
departments are most important. This is an example of a detail marketing budget with 
supporting reasons for the expense.

Mr Wise of Cycle Wheels Supplies, which specialises in the sale of bicycles, has drawn 
up the monthly sales budget. Mr Wise has cashflow problems and will look for the root 
of the problem in sales that do not agree with the budget. The budgeted and actual sales 
figures for the bicycles are as follows (actual figures are only available up to June):

After considerable investigation, Mr Wise came to the following conclusions:
•	 When he drew up the budget, he thought he would sell more bicycles because of a 
big race that was due to take place locally in July.
•	 January’s sales are lower than budgeted (due to over-expectation), but still show a 
2% growth over the previous year’s figures.

Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
•	 February’s budgeted figures were still based on over-expectation and also show a 
2% growth over last year’s figures.
•	 March showed no deviation, as Mr Wise launched a major advertising campaign.
•	 April’s sales still show 2% growth over last year’s sales, but did not come up to 
expectations.
•	 Sales for May are weaker, as all potential race participants have already bought their 
bicycles from a competitor, Wheelly Warehouse, located 2 km down the road from 
Mr Wise.
•	 Sales for June are not as budgeted, but it was definitely a good month, as the shop 
was crowded with overseas visitors who arrived for the Olympic Games. June 
showed a 20% growth over the previous year’s figures.
Mr Wise concludes that he should examine not only the sales budget, but also his 
expenses to determine where he overspent, resulting in the cashflow problems he is 
experiencing.
16.14	  USING A COMPUTER TO DRAW UP BUDGETS 
There are a number of computer programs available to help businesses to draw up 
budgets. The advantage of using one of these programs is that you can change a single 
figure and the program will automatically revise your budget. If you don’t have a 
computer package, you can also draw up your budgets using Microsoft’s Excel or any 
other spreadsheet program. 
If you use Excel, remember to work with formulas in your tables, otherwise the program will 
not automatically recalculate your budgets when you change individual figures.   
When using a computer program you can create sales charts of expected sales and use 
it to review actual sales achieved. Use the charts to understand your sales forecast, does 
it look real? Does it make sense? This chart is an example of putting your data into a 
graph it reflects the previous year sales in rand, budgeted sales and actual sales for 
the current year. It is a visual interpretation on growth of sales as well as whether the 
budget has been met.

16.15  SUMMARY 
In this chapter we looked at how to draw up budgets. A business uses many budgets, 
and together these make up the master budget. We learnt that the sales budget is the first 
budget that must be drawn up, and that the sales budget depends on the sales forecasts. 
We then discussed the production budget, the labour budget and the cashflow budget, 
and drawing up the income statement and the balance sheet. Finally we learnt about 
assessing the difference between actual and budgeted figures, and the advantages of 
using computer programs in budgeting.

Mike’s intention is to start trading on 1 January 20xx. Mike is going to market 
and distribute a revolutionary anti-static computer device called ANT in 
KwaZulu-Natal. This device is manufactured in South Korea. He is confident 
that he can sell an average of 5 000 units of ANT per month, but he recognises 
that there will be a start-up phase – it will take time to become known and 
established in the market place. He would like to formulate a profit and loss 
projection and cashflow forecast before starting the business. 
	
The following details are pertinent to the proposed business:
•	
The Korean company wants a committed monthly order, confirmed for a 
six-month period at a time. 
•	
The cost price per ANT is R80 and payment terms are cash on delivery. 
Orders for the six-month period must be placed two months prior to 
first delivery. Mike has decided that his first order will be 2 000 units 
per month for the first three-month period. The order for the next three 
months will be 2 200 units per month. The first shipment will be received 
on 5 January 20xx.

The selling price of ANT in KwaZulu-Natal will be R1 200 per unit. The

an average of 30 days will be taken for payment, even after implementing 
strict credit control procedures. 
•	
Mike intends to employ a sales representative and pay him or her a fixed 
salary of R5 000 per month, as well as a sales commission of 2% on sales 
achieved. The sales commission will be paid in the month following sales 
achieved. Mike believes that the sales representative will account for 30% 
of sales, and he himself for 70%.

Rental expense would amount to R2 000 per month and is payable at the

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Peter Mashaba established Peter’s Business in 1997 in the East Mamelodi, Gauteng. His 
humble beginning as an entrepreneur entailed buying milk from a dairy farmer close 
to this area and reselling it to his neighbours, from his 20 m2 bedroom. The need for 
different quantities of fresh milk, available on a daily basis, evolved in the establishment 
of a small retail outlet and later developed into the 200 m2 Mamelodi Dairy Market, a 
well-known landmark in this region. Fresh milk is sold in different quantities according 
to the specifi c needs of the customer.
Peter also identifi ed and exploited the opportunity to make cheese and yoghurt as 
derivative products of milk. This business unit operates from a factory in Watloo, Pretoria. 
It follows a focused and differentiated strategy in providing customised products to 
delicatessen and home industries in the broader Tshwane metropolitan area.
The business intends to increase its turnover to R4.5 million in 2015 with specifi c growth 
strategies in place, as explained in more detail in the business plan. The gross profi t 
margin equals approximately 60%.
The purpose of this plan is primarily to serve as a planning instrument and will be 
adapted to the needs of an investor in order to fi nance some of the medium-term 
growth strategies, for example the purchase of a dairy farm.
2. BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
2.1 
General description of the business
Peter’s Business is a close corporation (PTY LTD) established in 1997. It initially oper-
ated as a milk reseller in the Mamelodi area. The business grew organically and diversi-
fi ed to include different milk formats (in terms of packaging), yoghurt and cheese. The 
current market expanded from the Lusaka area in Mamelodi East, to include up-market 
delicatessens and home industries in the entire Tshwane metropolitan area.
Peter’s Business’s distribution structure is channelled as follows:
Peter’s Business
Manufacturing & Packaging
Packaging
Business-to-business
Retail
Diary Market (Mamelodi)
Delis & Home Industries
(Tswane region)

Appendix A
325
Peter’s Business operates from a medium-sized manufacturing unit in the industrial 
area of Watloo, Silverton (Pretoria) where all the fresh milk is received and either 
repackaged in smaller units (500 ml, 1 ℓ or 2 ℓ) or transformed into yoghurt and cheese 
products. 
Peter’s Business owns a dairy market that was opened in 2001 with an approximate 
size of 200 m2 in Mamelodi East. This retail outlet only sells fresh milk to residents in 
the area in either bulk or smaller units. 
The business-to-business leg of the business entails offering yoghurt and cheese products 
to five delicatessens and 15 home industries in the broader Tshwane metropolitan area. 
Peter’s Business intends to expand this offering to the northern parts of Johannesburg 
in the near future. 
2.2	
Industry background 
The dairy branch of industry has the following characteristics relevant to the retail end:
•	 a growing demand for healthy dairy-related products (eg no fat and low fat products) 
•	 a low profit margin for the producer 
•	 a decline in the number of producers of fresh milk 
•	 an increase in the cost of transport for perishable products 
•	 a big increase in consumer spending on retail goods
•	 a big demand for specialised dairy products (eg cheese). 
2.3	
Primary goals of the business 
Peter’s Business has the following objectives: 
Short-term (2015 –2016):
•	 to increase its overall turnover to R4 437 245 
•	 to obtain two contracts for delivery of cheese and yoghurt in the northern 
Johannesburg region 
•	 to buy another truck for self-delivery 
•	 to appoint a general manager at the factory

Medium-term (2015–2017):

Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
326
•	 to increase overall turnover to R6 million per annum

standards. Peter’s Business offers the following unique services: 
Mamelodi Dairy Market:

parents and households to buy milk before and/or after work 
•	 allows customers to use and reuse their own containers of any size 
•	 provides adequate parking and enough attendants at the cash registers to serve 
customers and limit long queues 
•	 provides information booklets on the health aspects of dairy products and basic 
recipes 
•	 maintains a loyal customer base 
•	 has a low price strategy, especially for customers with own containers. 
Business-to-business:

•	 provides fresh delivery 

Appendix A
327
•	 maintains good relationships with customers. 
3.	 MARKETING PLAN 
3.1  Marketing research and analysis 
A survey was conducted by a private research entity concerning the need for dairy pro-
ducts in the Mamelodi area. The results showed that there is a huge need for fresh milk, 
particularly milk at a better price than available at the Spaza outlets in the area. The 
quality of the milk is also of great concern. 
3.2  Target market 
The market for Peter’s Business is segmented and forms two basic target markets. The 
first pertains to the Mamelodi Dairy Market. The characteristics of this target market 
are: 
•	 households within a 5 km radius of the outlet, living in the eastern side of Mamelodi 
•	 households with an average size of five individuals 
•	 households with an income of between R1 500–R5 000 per month 
•	 households that buy milk twice a week (with an average of 2 litres per purchase). 
Women form the primary purchaser of fresh milk in this region. 
The business-to-business leg of the business has the following market:
•	 delicatessens in the Tshwane metropolitan area, focusing on the top end of the mar-
ket (high income), selling ‘homemade’ yoghurt and cheese 
•	 home industries in the Tshwane metropolitan area, focusing on the top end of the 
market (high income), selling ‘homemade’ yoghurt and cheese. 
3.3  Market size and market share 
The current market size for both these target markets is:
•	 Mamelodi Dairy Market: 120 000 households, of which it is believed Peter’s Busi-
ness has captured 40% of the market share 
•	 Business-to-business: There are 35 delicatessens and home industries in the Tshwa-
ne area, of which Peter’s Business is believed to have captured 57% of the market 
share. 

Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
328
3.4  Competition 
Peter’s Business operates in a highly competitive market environment and competes 
with the following (a detailed competitive analysis is available on request): 
Mamelodi Dairy Market:
(a)	Spaza shops (eight in the immediate market environment) 
(b)	Checkers, approximately 7 km from the outlet 
(c)	Outside the area – indirect competition (households buying milk on their way from work). 
Business-to-business:
(a)	Large suppliers selling bulk units (eg Makro and Jumbo), although not the same 
specialised products. 
(b)	Dairy farms surrounding the Tshwane area with more or less the same product 
types. 
(c)	Importing companies that obtain specialised cheeses from the Netherlands and 
Switzerland as well as other regions in South Africa (although not as price effective). 
3.5  Marketing strategy

3.7  Promotion strategy 
Peter’s Business follows the following promotion strategy with regards to its product 
range. 

Entrepreneurship for IT Professionals
330
Mamelodi Dairy Market 
Currently the most effective medium of promotion for this leg of the business is the 
‘word-of-mouth’ medium. The Mamelodi Dairy Market is known for its quick and 
effective service, quality as well as the availability of fresh milk. Peter Mashaba realised 
that community involvement also plays an enormous role in promoting the business. 
He developed a very neat soccer field at the back of the outlet and invests in experienced 
coaches for the development of young players. Apart from this, a 2 m x 3 m billboard 
serves as the main advertising medium. This board indicates all the specials that run 
every fortnight. 
Business-to-business 
The promotion strategy for this business unit is two-fold. Direct marketing to all the 
delis and home industries seems to be the most effective medium to date. Peter attends 
to this medium himself. Each and every retail outlet is visited on a monthly basis (in 
terms of the retainer customers) and he endeavours to see at least one new customer per 
month. The entire product line is shown and even tasted and afterwards adapted to the 
exact needs of customers (retailers). The second format of promotion is the attendance 
of at least three trade shows per annum. Peter links his promotion strategy with the 
capacity of his factory and tries not to oversell. 
3.8  Distribution strategy 
Peter’s Business obtains all its milk from a very reliable dairy farmer close to the small 
town of Cullinan. This farm is approximately 8 km from the Mamelodi Dairy Market 
and 14 km from the factory in Watloo. The short distance from the supplier forms part of 
the core competence of this business due to the increasingly high cost of the transport of 
perishable products. The farmer delivers directly to the dairy market at a cost of R10/km.  
Peter decided to buy a cooler truck for transferring the milk to the factory in Watloo. 
This truck is also easily adapted to a delivery vehicle for the business-to-business unit. 
The milk delivery to the factory takes place on a daily basis and deliveries to the retail 
customers once a week (with an increase during high season). 
4.	 LOCATION
The locations of both the dairy market and factory are first close to the supplier (as 
indicated in the Marketing plan) and second close to its consecutive groups of 
customers. The expansion ability on both these sites is possible within the long-term 
objectives of the business. Peter employs only people from the direct community and 
provides training as needed.

Appendix A
331
5.	 MANAGEMENT PLAN
Peter’s Business has reached a point where a professional management team should 
replace the over-emphasised role of the entrepreneur and founder (Peter Mashaba). 
Peter currently works seven days a week for approximately 12 hours a day.
5.1  Organisational structure
Peter therefore plans to re-organise the structure of the business in order to enable him 
to spend more time on strategic issues – compulsory for effective growth. The following 
organisational structure is to be implemented in the short term.

fields. Peter’s Business also complies with the following legislation:
•	 Labour Relations Act (No 66 of 1995)
•	 Basic Conditions of Employment Act (No 75 of 1997)
•	 Employment Equity Act (No 55 of 1998)
•	 Skills Development Act (No 97 of 1998)

a.  Ownership structure
Peter Mashaba is currently the only member in Peter Business PTY LTD (2008/446665/ 
23) and operates with a 100% BEE status. Peter intends to sell a 20% membership of his 
business in order to finance his growth strategies. Another 6% will be distributed to 
staff members, based on an incentive scheme (to be developed).
