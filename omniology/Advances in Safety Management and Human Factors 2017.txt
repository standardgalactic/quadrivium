Preface
Safety Management and Risk Prevention is a common thread throughout every
workplace, yet keeping employee safety and health knowledge current is a con-
tinual challenge for all employers. Safety Management and Human Factors is a
cross-disciplinary area concerned with protecting the safety, health and welfare of
people engaged in work or employment. The book offers a platform to showcase
research and for the exchange of information in safety management and human
factors. Mastering Safety Management and Human Factors concepts is fundamental
to both the creation of products and systems that people are able to use and for work
systems design, avoiding stresses and minimizing the risk for accidents.
This book focuses on the advances in the Safety Management and its relation-
ship with Human Factors, which are a critical aspect in the design of any
human-centered technological system. The ideas and practical solutions described
in the book are the outcome of dedicated research by academics and practitioners
aiming to advance theory and practice in this dynamic and all-encompassing
discipline.
A total of six sections are presented in this book:
I. Accident Analysis and Risk Prevention
II. Culture and Organizational Aspects
III. Applications in Safety Management and Loss Prevention
IV. Safety and Ergonomics
V. Fatigue and Performance

Abstract. The Workplace incident investigation methodology has typically
developed
alongside
our
understanding
of
accident
causation
and
the
ever-evolving associated models. The research-practice gap that has existed and
continues to exist, presents an interesting area for discussion and future research.
Through analysis of literature in the ﬁeld of incident/accident investigation
methodologies, this paper focuses on a number of models in the context of
practice within a small to mid-sized enterprise and in particular looks at what
can be considered as best practice for such an enterprise.

Introduction
This paper examines different models and methods for accident and incident investi-
gation, with the goal of making suitable recommendations for a ‘Best Practice’ solution
for a mid-size company which employs approximately 80 personnel. Preliminary
results of this examination suggest that there may be no ‘one-size-ﬁts all’ solution to
providing a method of investigation to an organisation (of any size) and that to answer
the question of; “what is best practice?” may require consideration beyond an organ-
isation’s size to provide better guidance on model/methodology selection.
2
Methodology
To perform an analysis with the aim of determining what is best practice in regards to
incident investigation methodology, it was necessary to perform a search of academic
articles to enable a thorough examination of contemporary approaches. To do this, a
strategy of selecting databases likely to yield peer-reviewed journal articles was
employed. This strategy involved initially searching The University of Newcastle’s
Library NEWCAT+ database, then with further concentration on academic journal
databases such as ProQuest and ScienceDirect.
For the purposes of reﬁnement, during the search for relevant peer reviewed journal
articles, a number of key words and terms (see Table 1) were used to help return
relevant articles. In addition to this, a number of ﬁlters were applied, such as limiting

articles to post 1990 (for contemporary articles), seeking only peer reviewed articles,
selecting speciﬁc journals and selecting only full-text articles.
Not all of the articles returned through searches were suitable for the purposes of
this paper and so were excluded from the discussion and analysis. Items such as
non-peer reviewed articles, non-English language articles, and those that did not
accurately reﬂect the topic (best practice incident/accident analysis methodology) were
eliminated from consideration in this analysis. The initial number of articles selected
for review prior to inclusion for discussion was thirty-eight. This was further reduced to
9 articles for the ﬁnal review and inclusion in this paper.

Discussion
In exploring the ways in which an incident investigation can be conducted and anal-
ysed, it becomes abundantly clear that there are many different models, methodologies
and proprietary systems available to safety practitioners and researchers alike [1]. In
part, this variance in methodology or model utilised reﬂects the lack of a uniﬁed
approach to accident causation theory in general [2]. This variety not only points to the
fact that there is no single solution to all industries, companies, or over geo-political, or
other social and technical boundaries, but that with such variety, it is likely that there is
a disconnect between the growth areas of research and practice [3]. This variability and
variety has implications for both; the potential need to employ more than one approach
to satisfy the needs of a single organisation, and what is deﬁned as best practice [4].
Due to the nature of this paper and it’s intent and constraints, it will not be possible
to discuss all methodologies of incident investigation/analysis that are in use today. It is
however the intent of this paper to provide an overview of some approaches within the
area and to provide recommendations regarding methodologies for a company with
approximately 80 employees.
An incident investigation can be divided up into two distinct phases. The ﬁrst phase
is focussed on the data gathering activities, which produces an array of information or
data. The second phase is the analysis of that data. Although there is a degree of
commonality amongst data gathering activities, some of these activities and their
associated outputs will naturally be inﬂuenced by several factors including investigator
bias (as a result of things such as knowledge, prior experience and training) and of
course, to some extent the model of analysis and it’s required inputs and outputs [4, 5].

Traditional views of accident investigation follow what may be regarded as a
sequential or linear pattern, such as in the case of methodologies based on Heinrich’s
Dominoes theory [1]. Within the research literature, many sequential models are crit-
icised for being overly simplistic in their ability to analyse incidents that occur within
complex systems, or incidents with more than one root cause [1, 3]. Despite their
seemingly simplistic view, these approaches have remained in use to varying degrees
[3]. Advances in accident investigation have led to multi-linear approaches to incident
investigation and allow for more contributory or causal factors to be identiﬁed [6].
However, they may have limited value in analysing more simplistic incidents, which
are typiﬁed by low impact – high frequency events [3, 7].
The Swish Cheese Model (SCM) of accident causation is a commonly applied
method within the area of investigations [8]. The model, whilst never originally being
intended to be a panacea to all investigations, does provide a useable framework for
both data gathering and incident analysis [8]. The SCM and its variants (e.g. ATSB)
has been referred to as a sequential model [8]. Being widely used presents an oppor-
tunity for small to mid-sized businesses in terms of the likelihood that personnel,
particularly practioners, but also managers and the like, will be familiar with the model
and its application [1, 3]. This may mean that for a small to mid-sized business; it could
be easier to embed such a process with personnel possibly being familiar with the basic
tenets of theory. With the framework in apparently wide use, this could also mean that
it may not be necessary for a small to mid-sized business to employ specialist prac-
tioners to conduct investigations, therefore presenting a ﬁnancial beneﬁt in reduced
wages and training costs [3].
The SCM presents several beneﬁts for investigators, and in particular for prac-
tioners. Firstly, the SCM analysis presents an output in a visual display, which offers
the beneﬁt of providing a readily understood representation of the inter-relationships
between contributing factors and the events for not only those trained (e.g. safety
personnel), but also for non-experts such as line managers [8]. Another area identiﬁed,
in which either a company or safety practioners may beneﬁt, is the timely generation of
an investigation report compared with other methods such as forms of Systemic
Accident Analysis (SSA), which may take twice as long to complete an analysis [8].
The SCM framework has received criticism on several fronts; namely that it is a
sequential technique, it can be prone to oversimplifying the mechanisms and facets
involved in accident causation and that, through over prescriptive application of the
model can lead to incorrect conclusions [8].
More recent developments in the area of incident investigation methodology has seen

attentionamongstresearchers[8].Non-linearmodelssuchasSystems-TheoreticAccident
Model and Process (STAMP), ACCIMAP and Functional Resonance Accident Model
(FRAM) have gained prominence by addressing some of the shortfalls, common to linear
sequence models [3, 6]. Non-linear models offer the promise of potentially being able to
decipher in greater detail, the complex interactions that are found amongst contributory
factors within incidents, through analysing incidents and the systems within which they
occur in a more holistic manner [6]. It is for this reason that in general, non-linear models
have been credited with being better suited to complex organisations [4].
Case Study in Best Practice Incident Investigation

The STAMP model, is based on systems and control theory and has been the
attention of a number of articles to date [3]. Underwood and Waterson (2014) identiﬁes
within their review of the research literature available, that STAMP is currently the
most widely cited of all the SAA models. Despite being the most widely cited of the
SAA models, it must be understood that SAA models in general appear not to have
made large inroads in terms of use across the wider safety community [8]. STAMP,
although a more recent addition to the methodologies available as noted above, is
worthwhile discussing as an option as an investigation methodology for a small to
mid-sized business.
Research into the STAMP model and its application to incidents has shown that
STAMP is effective in addressing how the complexity within a system inﬂuences
accidents [6, 8]. The STAMP model acknowledges that systems are both complex and
dynamic and that incidents are not the result of a singular loss of control [8]. For an
investigator this systemic and holistic approach could mean that they not only ﬁnd a
more signiﬁcant number of contributory factors in an incident, (through highlighting
the interactions between system factors) that they can potentially identify more effec-
tive control measures which may otherwise not be identiﬁed by linear models [8].
The STAMP model, like any other faces limitations. The limitations found with the
STAMP model can be viewed from the perspective of useability [3, 6]. SAA models
such as STAMP are apt to be viewed as resource intensive from an array of per-
spectives including costs; associated with training in the methodology, and time taken
to perform the analysis. Much of the research into the STAMP model and its efﬁcacy
has relied upon its application to large scale or low frequency-high consequence
incidents, such as single and multiple fatalities, or large scale events [3, 6]. The issue
then becomes one of scalability, whereby in a practical setting, it is difﬁcult to gauge
from the literature how efﬁcient and how suitable this methodology is for more sim-
plistic incidents [4]. In and of itself, this could raise questions about its practical
application to a small to mid-sized company.
One criticism of the STAMP model is in respect to putting it into practice arises
from the differences in the data gathered as an input to the analysis [6]. With the
STAMP model, there is a greater amount of data required and it has been claimed that
much of this data is different from traditional data gathered and utilises techniques not
necessarily used by other models [6]. The implications for the differences in data and
data gathering between STAMP and other techniques include increased time to ulti-
mately generate and communicate a report of the ﬁndings, and the potential need for
more specialist trained investigators [2].
Both SCM and STAMP models suffer in regards to their reliability due to their
qualitative nature [8]. These models do however share a moderate level of reliability
[8]. Validity, of both models has been difﬁcult to deﬁnitively establish, which may
reﬂect the tendency for incident investigations to contain a level of subjectivity and the
difﬁculties in establishing internal measure for validity [8].
Both models, in their own way aim to provide answers to the why and how an
incident occurred, and they also intend to allow for the identiﬁcation of suitable con-
trols to mitigate the likelihood of repeat incidents [9]. In comparing the strengths and
weaknesses of SCM and STAMP together, a picture is created about what might be
best practice for a small to mid-sized company that employs 80 personnel. Best practice
6
J. Barlow and M. Pillay

has been deﬁned as “a procedure that has been shown by research and experience to
produce optimal results and that is established or proposed as a standard suitable for
widespread adoption” [10]. This deﬁnition allows both models to be considered best
practice, however to resolve the issue of which of these two models is more suitable for
use within a small to mid-size company, the question may need to be viewed more
from the angle of which is more ﬁt-for-purpose? Research has shown that some
organisations have looked at this very question and due to several factors, have had
difﬁculty in adopting a single incident analysis methodology [4]. During research into
Nova, a chemical processor, it was found that there was a total of eleven methodologies
in use across the business [4]. The use of multiple methodologies had arisen out of the
variable needs of different areas of the business [4]. From this, it can be extrapolated
that there may not be a single investigation technique that is practical for use within our
small to mid-size company.
Finally, in this discussion it is important to highlight some of the limitations of the
research
in
this
ﬁeld
in
general.
Many
of
the
studies
of
models
and
investigation/analysis techniques appear to be reliant on qualitative analysis and limited
sample sizes (e.g. surveys and structured interviews) and often focussed on large scale
events, thereby limiting the potential for generalisation to usefulness on small scale
investigations [8, 9]. Given the limitations faced by the current research and models, in
particular such as those as STAMP, it would be in the best interest of researchers to
concentrate efforts on testing the models on a variety of incidents, both within and
external to complex organisational systems.

Recommendations
Through the discussion and analysis throughout this paper, the intent has been to show
what would be considered best practice in terms of incident/accident investigation
methodology for a company with approximately 80 employees. From the discussion,
several points arise, that need to be accounted for before a model or methodology can
be fully adopted or implemented within an organisation, including: size and complexity
of the organisation, and the industry in which it is based and the resources available.
Further research involving a longitundinal study of both a SCM, and STAMP,
whereby a standardized set of tools for each model is developed together with, stan-
dardized investigator training, that is carried out across a sufﬁciently large sample size
of organisations that ﬁt into the category of small to mid sized enterprises is conducted
is needed.
5
Conclusion
Whilst STAMP is a model that is gaining attention and momentum within the ﬁeld, it
would prove difﬁcult to implement and embed successfully within a small to mid-sized
company of 80 employees, due to resource constraints (appropriately trained personnel,
time allowed to generate reports) and likely incidents to be encountered (high versus
low outcome). All this having being said the STAMP model should not be discounted

out of hand, particularly if the organisation within which the model is to be applied is
complex in nature or the organisation has the resourcing to allow for a multi-tiered
system of incident investigation.
If having to provide a single incident investigation methodology to a small to
mid-sized company, the discussion and this paper would recommend that such a
company adopt a Swiss Cheese Model approach to its investigations. This is in line
with ﬁndings by others [3, 8], due it’s wide spread adoption throughout many indus-
tries, its ability to provide moderately reliable results in a timely fashion and its
useability by experts and nonexperts alike.

Abstract. Work psychologists play a crucial role in today’s work systems,
where psychological stressors are on the rise. However, the occupational proﬁle
of work psychologists is not clearly deﬁned by Austrian law and atypical
employment might be common among Austrian work psychologists. In our
study, we identiﬁed aspects of an undeﬁned and insecure occupational proﬁle
and hypothesized a positive association with role ambiguity, which in turn was
supposed to affect psychological wellbeing negatively. Finally, we hypothesized
that well-functioning cooperation with occupational physicians would buffer
experiences of role ambiguity in work psychologists. 31 experts were inter-
viewed and salient topics served as a base for an Austria-wide online survey
study with N = 122 participating work psychologists. Regression analyses
supported the assumed effects. The results highlight the importance of a more
clearly deﬁned occupational proﬁle for work psychologists. We discuss viable
approaches to improve working conditions for work psychologists in Austria.

Introduction
Since the emergence of mega trends such as globalization, ﬂexibilization, and new
forms of communication and information technology, the character of work has shifted
signiﬁcantly from physical to mental work. Psychological stressors accompany this
shift, conﬁrmed by the considerable increase of work-related stress and associated
disorders [1].
The European Union enacted a policy in 1989 [2] that pledged all member states to
establish uniform minimum standards of workplace safety and health in national leg-
islation. In Austria, the respective act is the “Worker Protection Act” [Arbeit-
nehmerInnenschutzgesetz]. In its last major amendment in 2013, the increase of
psychological stressors has been accounted for explicitly by clarifying that the eval-
uation of work-related psychological stressors is an obligatory part of workplace safety
and health activities.

Although the analysis and evaluation of work-related psychological stressors is a
key competence of work psychologists, the profession lacks a clear statutory basis in
Austria when compared to occupational physicians and safety engineers. What’s more,
Austrian law remains somewhat vague in deﬁning both the occupational proﬁle of
work psychologists and the practice of the evaluation of work-related psychological
stressors, respectively. Consequently, employers in Austria are not obliged to engage
work psychologists for prevention in contrast to occupational physicians and safety
engineers. Although the competencies and qualiﬁcations of work psychologists
encompass far more than the evaluation of psychological stressors, this in fact is the
gateway for many work psychologists to receive an initial assignment and hopefully
the ﬁrst step for a longer-term mandate in organizations.
The fact that Austrian law does not protect the job title “work psychologist” is
another aspect of legal insecurity. This impedes the establishment of clear quality
standards because any psychologist may refer to him- or herself as work psychologist
without having to provide evidence for a speciﬁc qualiﬁcation. In summary, as work
psychologists only slowly gain ground in occupational health and safety and do not yet
experience appropriate consideration by the law, the deﬁnition of their occupational
role is still insufﬁcient.

Theoretical Background
2.1
Precarious Employment for Work Psychologists in Austria
Due to the underlying conditions summed up above, work psychologists are facing
difﬁculties to compete in the labor market. Atypical employment is the rule since the
majority of work psychologists are own account workers [3]. In absence of scientiﬁc
studies examining working conditions of occupational health and safety professionals
in general and work psychologists in particular, it remains unknown to what extent
atypical employment relates to risks of precarity for work psychologists in Austria.
While various concepts of precarity or precarious employment have been proposed
[4, 5], there currently exists no universally accepted deﬁnition. According to Keller and
Seifert [6], precarious employment is characterized by the absence of one of the fol-
lowing four criteria: household income that ensures the livelihood, employment sta-
bility, employment ability, and integration in the social beneﬁt system. These criteria
are less likely to ﬁnd in atypical employments. For example, the salary of part-time
workers may not ensure livelihood or own-account workers may neglect private
unemployment or pension insurance. Atypical employment may therefore promote
precarity.
In this paper, we will examine how precarious employment manifests in the work
life of work psychologists in Austria and how it impacts their wellbeing. In doing so,
we will ﬁrst describe several aspects of an undeﬁned and insecure occupational proﬁle
for work psychologists. From a psychological point of view, we will then investigate
the process of precarity as it affects human behavior and experience.

Working Conditions and Psychological Wellbeing
Working conditions are important determinants for mental health and wellbeing [7, 8].
A series of work-related psychological factors have been shown to affect psychological
wellbeing [9]. In particular, job insecurity is likely to exert a detrimental inﬂuence on
physical and mental health as well as psychological wellbeing [7, 10–12]. Job inse-
curity may refer to uncertainty regarding either the job’s consistent existence (quan-
titative aspect) or the continuance of subjectively important job characteristics
(qualitative aspect) [13]. The perception of an undeﬁned and insecure occupational
proﬁle for work psychologists primarily relates to quantitative job insecurity, because
in competing in the labor market, the continuance of the job itself is at stake.
2.3
Organizational Role Theory and Social Support
Role theory refers to speciﬁc forms of organizational behavior that are associated with a
given professional position [14]. All members of an organization develop ideas and
attitudes of what is appropriate and inappropriate for a certain occupational role.
Therefore, the role owner faces various expectations from other organizational members
(e.g., employer, colleagues) and tries to meet these expectations. Undeﬁned role
expectations (e.g., ambiguous assignments) lead to uncertainty about goals. This, in
turn, will trigger regulation uncertainty, since the sequence of actions from a present
state to a desired end state cannot be known if the end state is vague. It is from such goal
and regulation uncertainties that role stress—i.e., role ambiguity and role conﬂict—
arises [15].
As suggested by various (psychological) work design models [16, 17], social
support is a signiﬁcant work-related resource. Moreover, social support may buffer the
negative consequences of role stressors on stress-related reactions [18, 19]. Interdis-
ciplinary cooperation is an essential aspect that contributes to the success and sus-
tainability of preventive activities. What’s more, cooperation with other professionals is
a valuable resource in daily work, related to both the accomplishment of tasks and the
cultivation of social contacts. Hence, a positive collaboration climate among different
professional groups provides social support in organizations.
2.4
Hypotheses
As explained above, we assume that work psychologists in Austria perceive their work
situation in ways that are indicative of an undeﬁned and insecure occupational proﬁle.
Drawing upon research on quantitative job insecurity [12], we expect an undeﬁned and
insecure occupational proﬁle to be associated with reduced psychological wellbeing.
Hypothesis 1. Perceptions of an undeﬁned and insecure occupational proﬁle correlate
negatively with psychological wellbeing.
In addition, a (legally) undeﬁned and insecure occupational proﬁle may lead to
uncertainties pertaining to the professional role and, consequently, give rise to role
“Day to Day, Town to Town, Sing My Songs, Travel on”?
11

stress. Since the occupational proﬁle of work psychologists is still relatively undif-
ferentiated and clear competencies have not been established, uncertainties and inse-
curities about adequate role behavior may emerge. In line with this reasoning, we
suppose that the perception of an undeﬁned and insecure occupational proﬁle is related
to increased role ambiguity. Scientiﬁc evidence suggests that more role ambiguity
relates to less psychological wellbeing [8]. We therefore assume that role ambiguity
mediates the relationship between an undeﬁned and insecure occupational proﬁle and
psychological wellbeing.
Hypothesis 2. The negative effect of an undeﬁned and insecure occupational proﬁle on
psychological wellbeing is mediated by role ambiguity.
According to research, a lack of social support affects psychological wellbeing
[7, 8]. Conversely, supportive forms of cooperation lead to positive consequences, as
outlined above. Occupational physicians are a well-established group and the proximity
of occupational medicine and occupational psychology qualiﬁes occupational physi-
cians as an important role model for work psychologists. Well-functioning collabora-
tion of occupational physicians and work psychologists is consequently supposed to act
as a moderating resource capable of preventing the emergence of role ambiguity. We
therefore assume a buffering effect on the positive association of an undeﬁned and
insecure occupational proﬁle with role ambiguity.
Hypothesis 3. Well-functioning cooperation with occupational physicians buffers the
detrimental effect of an undeﬁned and insecure occupational proﬁle on role ambiguity
among work psychologists.

Method
The present study is the result of a project that evaluated the working situation of
occupational physicians, safety engineers, and work psychologists in Austria [20]. In a
ﬁrst step, we interviewed 31 experts (practitioners, representatives of professional
groups, social partners, policy makers). The interview data were then subjected to
qualitative content analysis in order to identify relevant topics of the working situation.
Salient topics served as a base for an Austria-wide online survey study across all three
professional groups. This article focuses on the data of work psychologists who par-
ticipated in the online survey study.
3.1
Sample
Data were gathered from N = 122 Austrian work psychologists. Participants were
recruited by email with help of two associations of the professional group of Austrian
psychologists. Respondents had a mean age of 42.01 years (SD = 8.86, range: 25–66)
and were predominantly female (71%). The majority were own-account workers (57%),
whereas employed work psychologists mostly had permanent contracts (88%). 68% of
the participants reported work psychology as their main profession, the remaining 32%
12
L. Hopfgartner et al.

referred to work psychology as their secondary profession. Mean job tenure was 9.14
years (SD = 7.10, range = 1–35).
3.2
Measures
Since the survey study required the generation of items customized to the speciﬁc
working situation of work psychologists in Austria, only few established scales could
be employed. The self-generated items were subjected to exploratory factor analysis to
identify patterns of interrelated variables. These patterns were then labeled undeﬁned
and insecure occupational proﬁle and cooperation with occupational physicians,
respectively, and aggregated to form unweighted additive indices [21].
Undeﬁned and Insecure Occupational Proﬁle. The index comprised eleven
self-generated items that were to be rated on a ﬁve-point response scale (from 1 = no,
not at all to 5 = yes, deﬁnitely). Complete item wordings are given in the Appendix
(Table 5). Internal consistency was good (Cronbach’s alpha [a] = .82).
Psychological Wellbeing. The WHO-5 Well-Being Index [22] was used. Apart from
measuring psychological wellbeing, this instrument is also appropriate to screen
depression [23]. The ﬁve items (example item: “during the last two weeks, I have felt
calm and relaxed”) had to be rated on a six-point response scale (from 1 = at no time to
6 = all of the time). Internal consistency proved to be good to excellent (a = .87).
Role Ambiguity. Role ambiguity was measured with three items (example “I know
exactly what is expected of me”) of a well-established role stress questionnaire [24].
Items were to be rated on a ﬁve-point response scale (from 1 = no, not at all to 5 = yes,
deﬁnitely). Item scores were reversed prior to the analysis. Internal consistency of the
scale was acceptable to good (a = .78).
Cooperation with Occupational Physicians. This index consisted of four items that
had to be answered along a ﬁve-point response scale (from 1 = no, not at all to 5 = yes,
deﬁnitely). High values on the scale represent work psychologists’ appraisal of the
cooperation with occupational physicians as useful and well-functioning. Complete
item wordings are given in the Appendix (Table 6). Internal consistency (a = .67) of
the index was only approaching acceptable regions.
3.3
Data Analyses
Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefﬁcient was used to test the correlation
hypothesis. Mediation and moderation analyses were conducted with standardized
variables in SPSS 21 with the PROCESS software [25]. To test for signiﬁcance of
indirect effects, bootstrapping conﬁdence intervals were used. Because of the high
proportion of women as well as the high range of participants’ age, the mediation and
moderation analyses were controlled for sex, age, and, additionally, job tenure.

Results
As indicated by means and standard deviations of the items subsumed in the index
“undeﬁned and insecure occupational proﬁle” (Table 5 in the Appendix), among the
most salient topics was the necessity for legal amendments (stronger legal foundation
for work psychologists in general, more prevention time for the evaluation of
work-related psychological stressors). Furthermore, people in general and employers in
particular were regarded as unaware of the competencies of work psychologists.
Respondents generally conﬁrmed that the cooperation with occupational physicians
is reasonable to them and that a more intense cooperation would be welcome (Table 6
in the Appendix). However, a considerable proportion of the respondents also con-
ﬁrmed cooperation problems.
Table 1 gives means, standard deviations, and correlations of the variables under
investigation. While respondents exhibited rather low levels of role ambiguity,
psychological wellbeing was high. Both indices (undeﬁned and insecure occupational
proﬁle and cooperation with occupational physicians) showed moderate positive levels.
4.1
Correlates of an Undeﬁned and Insecure Occupational Proﬁle
All bivariate correlations were in line with expectations (Table 1). An undeﬁned and
insecure occupational proﬁle correlated positively with role ambiguity (r = .47,
p < .01), negatively with psychological wellbeing (r = −.36, p < .01, conﬁrming

role ambiguity and cooperation with occupational physicians (r = −.25, p < .01).
Psychological wellbeing and cooperation with occupational physicians was positively
correlated (r = .20, p < .05).

Mediating Effect of Role Ambiguity
We found a partially mediating effect of role ambiguity on the association between an
undeﬁned and insecure occupational proﬁle and psychological wellbeing (b = −.14,
95% CI [−.29, −.04]). Hypothesis 2 was therefore conﬁrmed (Table 2).

Moderating Effect of Cooperation with Occupational Physicians
Cooperation with occupational physicians exerted a buffering inﬂuence on the positive
effect of an undeﬁned and insecure occupational proﬁle on role ambiguity (b = −.17,
p = .03; Table 3).
Hypothesis 3 could thus be conﬁrmed. In addition, by combining the results of the
mediation and the moderation analysis, a moderated mediation could be established.
Conditional indirect effects of an undeﬁned and insecure occupational proﬁle via
increased role ambiguity on reduced wellbeing at three different values of the mod-
erator (cooperation with occupational physicians; sample mean ± 1 SD) are given in
Table 4. As respondents rated cooperation with occupational physicians more favor-
ably, the negative conditional indirect effect fell in magnitude. For moderator levels of
one SD above the sample mean, the effect was no longer statistically signiﬁcant
(b = −.06, p > .05).

Discussion
The aim of this study was to examine aspects of precarious employment of work
psychologists in Austria that were derived from interviews and a subsequently con-
ducted survey study. We considered the bivariate relationships between an undeﬁned
and insecure occupational proﬁle and role ambiguity, and, in further consequence, the
respective effects on psychological well-being. Moreover, we examined a buffering
effect of a well-functioning cooperation with occupational physicians on the relation-
ship between an undeﬁned and insecure occupational proﬁle and role ambiguity.
Bivariate associations revealed an undeﬁned and insecure occupational proﬁle to
correlate positively with role ambiguity and negatively with psychological wellbeing
(Hypothesis 1). Hence, work psychologists who perceived an undeﬁned and insecure
occupational proﬁle experienced more role ambiguity and less psychological wellbeing
compared to work psychologists who perceived a well-deﬁned and more secure
occupational proﬁle.
The postulated mediation effect of role ambiguity on the relationship between an
undeﬁned and insecure occupational proﬁle and psychological wellbeing (Hypothe-
sis 2) was also conﬁrmed. Detrimental effects of an undeﬁned and insecure occupa-
tional proﬁle on psychological wellbeing were partially mediated by role ambiguity.
The result suggests that work psychologists who perceived an undeﬁned and insecure

occupational proﬁle found it difﬁcult to identify a clear professional role, leading them
to experience role ambiguity and, in consequence, less psychological wellbeing. As the
mediation was partial, experiences of an undeﬁned and insecure occupational proﬁle
still impaired wellbeing directly after controlling for the mediating inﬂuence of role
ambiguity. This hints at other inﬂuences not accounted for by this study.
Lastly, the proposed buffer effect of cooperation with occupational physicians on
the mediation (Hypothesis 3) was conﬁrmed as well. The moderation analysis con-
ﬁrmed the helpful character of a well-functioning cooperation with occupational
physicians. In particular, a well-functioning and supportive cooperation between work
psychologists and occupational physicians is suitable to mitigate the emergence of role
ambiguity as a consequence of a perceived undeﬁned and insecure occupational proﬁle.
The fact that this cooperation already exerts its inﬂuence in the ﬁrst stage of the
mediation, thereby impeding the genesis of role ambiguity, is particularly remarkable.
Therefore, cooperation with occupational physicians should be considered a vital
resource for work psychologists in their professional life. Since item means hinted at
certain signs of cooperation problems between work psychologists and occupational
physicians, this ﬁnding becomes all the more important.
It is worth of mention that these effects were found in spite of the fact that par-
ticipants reported rather low levels of role ambiguity and only moderate levels of an
undeﬁned and insecure occupational proﬁle. A mean job tenure of nine years may
partly explain these results, suggesting that a substantial portion of the sample con-
sisted of experienced work psychologists. Hence, it is plausible to assume that the
magnitude of both main and moderation effects will increase in magnitude as
respondents report higher levels of an undeﬁned and insecure occupational proﬁle and
role ambiguity, respectively—which could be expected for job entrants, for example.
5.1
Limitations
Due to the nature of the study, a compromise concerning measurement had to be made
between practice-orientation (i.e., utilizing few items, generating items customized to
relevant topics) and scientiﬁc standards (i.e., employing reliable and valid scales).
Consequently, measurement suffered a number of shortcomings. First, we could only
employ a subset of items of the original role ambiguity scale, which may have limited
content validity. Second, the indices “undeﬁned and insecure occupational proﬁle” and
“cooperation with occupational physicians” consisted of self-generated items. Since
indices were composed according to qualitative results of interviews with experts in the
ﬁeld, they should not be expected to represent unidimensional, theoretically grounded
constructs [26].
It is unclear whether the index “undeﬁned and insecure occupational proﬁle” and
the role ambiguity scale represent two distinct constructs. Conceptually, the index
comprises speciﬁc conditions unique to the work situation of work psychologists,
whereas the scale abstracts from concrete work situations. A series of conﬁrmatory
factor analyses, conducted in spite of the small sample size, rather supported the notion
of a two-factor solution, although ﬁt parameters generally were unacceptable.

Causal pathways other than those proposed in this study may exist. Longitudinal
data on the dynamics of the work situation and the occupational proﬁle of work
psychologists would not only help shed light on causal relationships but also capture
antecedents and consequences of a developing professional proﬁle and identity of work
psychologists.

Conclusion
Work psychologists perceive a blurry occupational proﬁle as an impediment to the
development of their profession that elicits role ambiguity, which in turn impairs
wellbeing. Cooperation with occupational physicians buffers such negative effects.
Well-functioning interdisciplinary cooperation is a key factor that ensures effective
interventions and is a source of social support among the professionals involved.
Austrian law should more clearly deﬁne the professional role of work psychologists.

Abstract. According to current prognosis, an excess of age is expected for the
working population. Therefore, dealing with age-related impairments of sensory
functions such as hearing impairment, is a central issue. Age and age-related
impairments might inﬂuence employees’ performance especially in exhausting
and stressful working situations. Furthermore, reduced hearing capacity bears a
serious safety risk. To improve the communication especially regarding safety,
communication friendly working procedures can be implemented.
A ﬁeld study with white-collar workers was conducted. Audiometric data
results showed that 57.9% of the participants had a slight hearing loss, 34.2%
showed a mild to moderate hearing impairment. Most of the participants
reported that they do strongly rely on communication at their workplace. Based
on interviews and workshops difﬁcult hearing situations were identiﬁed and
procedures to prevent misunderstandings were derived. Furthermore, examples
of procedures to improve the hearing environment are presented.

Introduction
According to current prognosis, an excess of age is expected for the working popu-
lation. Therefore, dealing with age-related impairments of sensory functions such as
hearing impairment is a central issue. Age and age-related impairments might inﬂuence
employees’ performance especially in exhausting and stressful working situations.
Furthermore, reduced hearing capacity bears a serious safety risk. Until now, the
problem of “aged workers” and slight/mild hearing impairment and the impact for the
working world has not been addressed in detail. To improve the communication
especially regarding safety, communication friendly working procedures can be
implemented. Therefore, it is important to develop working procedures which are as
behavior-related as possible.

1.1
Reduced Hearing Capacity
In general hearing impairment is deﬁned as a hearing loss of 20 dB or more on at least
one ear or rather the worse ear regarding the speech-relevant frequencies (0.5 kHz,
1 kHz, 2 kHz, 4 kHz) [1]. According to the WHO hearing related problems (e.g.
hearing impairment or tinnitus) belong to the ten most frequent diseases in countries
with middle and high income [2].
Ability to Work. One third of the participants of a large Swedish study [3] (overall
number of participants = 11441) reported to suffer from difﬁculties with hearing (tin-
nitus, hearing impairment or both). Regarding the situation of employment, this study
showed that 31% of the study participants were employed and 36% were
non-employed. The prevalence to suffer from hearing problems increased with age and
was higher in men than in women.
Furthermore, it seems that hearing impairment and early retirement may indeed
have a connection: According to the National Academy of Aging Society [4] in the
U.S., 18% of hearing-impaired people (age range 51 to 61 years) were retired, whereas
only 12% of normal hearing people were retired at the same age.
Cognitive Performance. Beattie, Barr and Roup [5] reported that people with a slight
to
moderate
hearing
impairment
show
a decrease
in
performance
regarding
speech-in-noise perception with a background noise of a signal-to-noise ratio of 15 dB.
This sort of background noise can be compared with the acoustic situation in an ofﬁce.
Furthermore, reduced hearing capacity can turn into a serious safety risk if warning
and/or information signals or environmental noises cannot be heard well enough [6] or
verbally given instructions are misunderstood [7].
There is indeed evidence that hearing-impaired people process cognitive infor-
mation without any error, but the information processing is related to an increased
effort compared with persons with normal hearing ability. To explain the difference in
information processing of hearing-impaired people, McCoy et al. [8] propose the
“effortfulness hypothesis” [9] which is based on the results of Rabbitt [10]. Following
the “effortfulness hypothesis” a person with deﬁcits in hearing capacity needs more
cognitive resources (higher performance effort) to achieve the same perceptual per-
formance as a normal hearing person. For hearing-impaired persons this leads to fewer
available process resources compared to normal hearing persons, to encode the content.
Need for Recovery, Job Control, Job Demands. Studies about age-related differ-
ences in the “need for recovery”-concept reveal similar results concerning fatigue:
older employees show more “need for recovery” than do younger employees [11, 12].
Interestingly, Nachtegaal et al. [13] showed a signiﬁcant relation between „need for
recovery after work “and hearing capacity, insofar that employees with poorer hearing
ability reported a higher “need for recovery after work” than employees with better
hearing ability.

1.2
Safety – Warning Signals, Information Signals or Environmental
Noises
Following Dantscher [14] various signals can occur at workplaces. These signals range
from emergency signals for evacuation, warning signals from vehicles and trans-
portation systems to signals from machines. Partially, norms exist in which design
regulations and standards for perceptibility are deﬁned. For example, DIN EN ISO
7731 [15] deﬁnes auditory danger signals for public and work areas. Generally, three
different types of danger signals can be distinguished: emergency signals in general,
emergency signals for evacuation and warning signals. Following the DIN EN ISO
7731 [15] the design of these signals should be unambiguous and differ from other
acoustic information. The level should reach a minimum of 65 dB(A), but should not
exceed a maximum of 118 dB(A). In addition, the norm emphasizes that the signals
must still be audible even if the hearing ability is limited (e.g. ear protection, hearing
impairment). Furthermore, it is important to adapt the design of signals to the speciﬁc
working situation in order to obtain that the signal will be heard. Dantscher [14]
suggests that the use of a standard warning system, which includes clear and distin-
guishable signals, would simplify work. If a standard warning system would be used,
workers would be able to react to warning signals in the right way, even if they change
the workplace or the employer.
Reduced Hearing Capacity. Reduced hearing capacity within the working world
requires special design of danger and warning signals. As mentioned before, following
the DIN EN ISO 7731 [15], danger signals should be designed in a way that they are
still audible even if the hearing ability is limited by using ear protection or caused by
hearing impairment. The DGUV [16] afﬁrm the importance of additive warning signals
considering people with reduced hearing capacity. As for example, visual warning
signals should be used in addition to the standard auditory warning signals. The DSB
[17] proposes several procedures to design ofﬁce elements e.g. fax-machines for
hearing-impaired employees with additional blinking lights. To avoid unexpected sit-
uations, the DSB [17] suggests that hearing-impaired or deaf people should have a seat
with a clear view to the door of their ofﬁce.
Furthermore, considering safety risks, Lin et al. [18] found that hearing impairment
might inﬂuence processes of selective attention. Moreover, Neijenhuis et al. [19]
compared performance between groups of different levels of hearing impairment and
found effects in selective attention at a mild hearing impairment (17.5 dB).

Method
2.1
Sample
The sample of this ﬁeld study consisted of 38 white-collar workers. One participant did
not report gender; two participants did not report age. Age ranged for the 20 women
and 17 men from 26–65 years, with a mean age of 50.06 years (SD = 7.49). The 38
participants worked in two different departments of one and the same organization

(18 participants worked at department “A”, 20 participants worked at department “B”).
One person did not participate in the interview due to personal reasons.
2.2
Procedure and Materials
The ﬁeld study was part of the project “R-Age-III: Recovery, Age and Performance III”
which is funded by the National Bank of Austria (OeNB) and consists of a ﬁeld and a
laboratory study. Overall, the ﬁeld study was conducted over a period of 4 weeks. In
the ﬁrst week, the ﬁeld study started with a presentation to introduce the study to the
participants (approx. one hour). Following the presentation, data collection was con-
ducted in form of the program called “Day of Hearing”. The program “Day of Hearing”
included several stations on the topic “Hearing”. Overall, participants had the oppor-
tunity to visit six different stations:
1. Audiometry (pure tone audiometry was conducted and participants additionally
self-assessed their hearing ability: CSS-SHI [20])
2. Interview (to identify difﬁcult or exhausting hearing situations within the working
context and ﬁnd ideas on how to deal with them)
3. Occupational medicine (to clarify results of pure tone audiometry if required)
4. Psycho-acoustic phenomena (to attract participants’ interest on the hearing-topic)
5. Different
Questionnaires
(survey
of
participants’
general
condition;
e.g.
RESTQ-Work 55/7 [21], SWE [22])
6. Cortisol (to provide a saliva-sample or hair-sample for measures of cortisol-levels)
and further individual appointments (participants had the opportunity to participate
in individual workplace analysis)
Both, the introduction presentation and the program of “Day of Hearing” were held
separately for department “A” and department “B”. In the following two weeks partici-
pants had the opportunity, as already mentioned, to participate in individual workplace
analysis. These analyses allow to collect subjective and objective information about
speciﬁc working situations, where a poorer hearing ability may affect work procedures or
lead to an increase in effort. Only two persons participated in these optional individual
workplace analyses. Due to ethical standards of data protection, results are not reported in
detail but are indeed included in the development of work procedures. In the fourth and
last week of the ﬁeld study, the ﬁnal workshops took place (individually for department
“A” and department “B”). Each workshop consisted of two different parts. In the ﬁrst part
of the workshop, results collected within the “Day of Hearing” and working-procedures to
handle situations with challenging hearing conditions derived from the interviews, were
presented and discussed. The second part of the ﬁnal workshops focused on further
development of work-procedures. Furthermore, information was collected, to which
extend work-procedures have already been implemented in the daily working life of the
participants. To do so, employees were divided into small groups to discuss and ﬁnally
present their ideas on work-procedures. Furthermore, the groups of employees were
invited to think about other hearing-related important domains in work life. At the end of
the ﬁnal workshops the ﬁeld study was evaluated. Three months later, individually for
department “A” and department “B” a ﬁnal presentation took place to present all collected
data and information of the ﬁeld study.

Results
3.1
Audiometry
Table 1 shows the distribution of participants to the three different hearing groups. In
contrast to criteria of the European Commission and WHO the classiﬁcation of hearing
groups was implemented using audiometric data of participants’ worse ear because
even hearing impairment on one ear can lead to problems in working situations. Due to
this fact, hearing impairment on one ear can be relevant from the viewpoint of occu-
pational psychology and of strain in work life.
Theresultsshow that 34.2%oftheparticipantsaremildto moderate hearing-impaired.
Regarding 57.9% of participants, at least a hearing related problem relevant to occupa-
tional psychology can be shown.
3.2
Importance of Communication at the Workplace
Most of the participants (51.4%) reported that they rely on communication at their
workplace to a very great extent (see Fig. 1).
3.3
Difﬁcult Hearing Situations
65.7% of the participants answered the interview question “Do you know situations,
which are difﬁcult or exhausting referring to ‘hearing’? “with “yes” (see Fig. 2).
The participants named the following difﬁcult hearing situations:
• Conference calls: visual information is missing; necessity to distinguish between
several voices
• Connection difﬁculties/poor mobile signal and poor mobile phone reception:
concerning mobile phone in the company building as well as on route
• Ventilation unit: permanent background noise
• Environmental noise: trafﬁc noise (street and railway station) close by
• Ofﬁce situations: background noise when several employees talk on the phone at
the same time; customer service
• Meetings/Discussions: necessity to distinguish between several voices
• Language barriers: technical jargon; misunderstandings.

Derivation of Procedures – Some Examples
Based on interviews and workshops, difﬁcult hearing situations were identiﬁed and
procedures to prevent misunderstandings were derived. Examples of behavior-related
“coping”-procedures are:
• Face-to-Face communication especially to make eye-contact with the dialog-
partner
• Use of media like emails instead of using the telephone to communicate important
messages

V. Wagner et al.

• Flexible working hours: Coordination of tasks which require a quiet environment
with working times of colleagues in the same ofﬁce; more ﬂexible core times
• Organization of the working week: Plan to do complex tasks on days, when most
of the other ofﬁce-colleagues are not in the ofﬁce (e.g. on route, in meetings, on
sales force)
• Fixed-line connection/landline phones instead of mobile phones: To avoid
connection difﬁculties on mobile phones resp. poor mobile signal in the company
building, it would be useful to install landline phones for employees who spend
most of their working time in the ofﬁce
• Information Mode: If connection difﬁculties occur, ask the person to write an
email
• Interpreter: To avoid language barriers it can be helpful to invite the concerning
person to come to the ofﬁce with an interpreter (e.g. family member etc….)
• Explain difﬁculties: If connection difﬁculties or language barriers occur, explain
the problem and try to ﬁnd a common solution
• Communication rules: Agree on signals, signs and gestures so that colleagues
know, if a certain task requires silence (e.g. raise or wave one’s hand, etc.)
• Volume adjustment: Adjust the volume of the phone to the individual optimum
• Headset: Considering longer conversations on the telephone using a headset can be
more comfortable
• Spatial situation: Deﬁne a special room where employees can go to and work if
certain work tasks need silence or high concentration
• Background noise: Try to reduce background noise to a minimum as for example
turn off the radio when concentration is needed or use agreed signal to show the
colleagues if a task requires silence (see also communication rules).

Discussion
First, the empirical data have shown that many employees are at least slightly
hearing-impaired. These results indicate that hearing impairment is an important
age-related impairment that should be considered especially in the light of expectations
for an aging of the working population. The results of our study are in line with data of
the WHO. Following the WHO hearing related problems belong to the ten most fre-
quent diseases in countries with middle and high income [2].
The importance of the ability to hear and understand information will be even more
emphasized by the results that show that 83% of the participants rely on communi-
cation at their workplace to a (very) great extent. It would be easy to assume that an
uncorrected hearing impairment might lead to problems and in the worst case to safety
risks in their working life.
Two-thirds of the participants reported difﬁcult hearing situations at their work-
place. Based on these results and the results of two workshops, procedures for persons
with reduced hearing capacity in different working environments have been developed
in a behavior-related manner. The derivation of procedures within our ﬁeld study
highlights the importance of the involvement of employees in their “normal” work
places. From our point of view, without this approach, a behavior-related derivation of
Age-related Impairments like Reduced Hearing Capacity – A Safety Issue
27

procedures that reﬂect problems in employees’ every day work life would not have
been possible.
Overall, the ﬁeld study could attract employees’ interest on the topic “Hearing” and
represents an important ﬁrst step on the integration of the topic “Hearing” in the
working ﬁeld. To receive a more comprehensive view on this important subject, further
research should be carried out regarding hearing impairment in the working world. It
might be also interesting to analyze different working areas and occupational ﬁelds.
Future Prospects. Currently, an experimental study is being conducted to ﬁnd the
procedures with highest effect sizes.

Abstract. Knowledge is in the heads of people. Managing knowledge is more
than maintaining data bases, but making sure, that relevant knowledge is
transferred from head to head. This is especially difﬁcult regarding tacit
knowledge on both, individual and collective level. In this applied research
project, two methods aiming at improving an organization’s knowledge man-
agement were developed: (a) A method for evaluating existing knowledge
management processes from a comprehensive point of view providing concrete
measures for improvement and (b) a method especially referring to the elicita-
tion of team speciﬁc collective tacit knowledge aiming at facilitating coopera-
tion awareness and triggering individual as well as joint learning. Both methods
were developed in close cooperation with industrial partners and pilot tested.
They delivered valuable insights for improvements.

Introduction
In safety critical systems, managing knowledge is becoming more and more crucial.
This is due to an increasing complexity of the systems as well as due to an increasing
division of labor. Both make cooperation of experts more and more demanding.
Although many organizations have knowledge management tools in place, the
exchange of knowledge often does not work in a sufﬁcient manner. This is especially
true regarding tacit knowledge.
Normally knowledge management focuses on documenting knowledge in written
electronical form. However, effective knowledge management is more than that. It
makes sure that knowledge is interpersonally transferred. Since knowledge is not “a
piece of paper” but a human property, knowledge management is not simply a question
of documentation, but subject of a transfer process that makes sure, that knowledge is
transferred “from heads to heads”. This process involves three phases: Knowledge
elicitation, knowledge documentation, and – in the core of the process – actual use of
knowledge.

In close cooperation with Swiss nuclear power plants (NPP) a method was
developed that supports both, (a) the evaluation of an organization’s existing knowl-
edge management processes as well as (b) the elicitation of tacit knowledge.
The evaluation method is generic. Based on state of art insights regarding pro-
moters and barriers of knowledge management it supports organizations in identifying
strengths and weaknesses in its knowledge transfer processes. The scope of this
evaluation is deliberately broad. It does not focus on the process only, but also on
framework conditions such as the procedure of its implementation or the culture it is
embedded in.
Whereas normally processes and instruments for managing explicit knowledge are
in place, the interpersonal exchange of tacit knowledge is much less systematically
supported. This is especially true for collective tacit knowledge. It was therefore an
objective of this research to develop a respective method. The method considers col-
lective tacit knowledge as distributed tacit knowledge regarding patterns of cooperating
in work teams. These patterns emerge over time in teams with a stable personnel
composition and allow for effective cooperation without explicit coordination. In a
perfectly functioning team this collective tacit knowledge involves a high compatibility
of (mainly unconscious) mutual expectations regarding cooperation. Such it allows for
a highly synergetic acting. However, if the mutual expectations do not ﬁt, disruptions in
cooperation are likely to occur, reducing team performance. As the mutual expectations
are tacit such disruptions may especially develop under the condition of ﬂuctuation in
team composition.
Following, the two developed methods for evaluating knowledge management
processes and for eliciting tacit knowledge are described in more details.
2
Evaluation of Knowledge Management Processes
2.1
Subject of Evaluation
The evaluation refers to all three phases of knowledge management. This makes sure
that knowledge management is not reduced to maintaining databases (i.e. documen-
tation of information) but considers the knowledge management process in a com-
prehensive manner, including both, knowledge elicitation as well as interpersonal
exchange of knowledge (i.e. actual use of knowledge), the latter of which is the core of
knowledge management.
Phase 1: The Elicitation of Relevant Knowledge. Several questions have to be
answered in a ﬁrst phase: What type of knowledge should be transferred (tacit or
explicit knowledge, collective or individual knowledge)? Which contents are relevant?
Who are the experts in the organization possessing this relevant knowledge? And,
ﬁnally, which methods, tools or techniques are suitable to elicit this type and content of
knowledge? Therefore, the aim of this ﬁrst phase is to make speciﬁc knowledge
available for knowledge transfer.
Phase 2: The Documentation of Knowledge. In a second phase, the elicited knowledge
has to be documented in an appropriate manner. Form and structure of this documentation
Managing Tacit Knowledge in Safety Critical Systems
31

have to be compatible with the speciﬁc type of knowledge and have to support the actual
use of the elicited knowledge. While checklists or user manuals are suitable to document
explicit factual knowledge they are presumably not appropriate for the documentation of
tacit knowledge, e.g. an expert’s operating experiences. To address that kind of knowl-
edge, other forms or formats, like videos, photos or prints, are necessary.
Phase 3: The Actual Use of Knowledge. The third phase contains the actual transfer
of the elicited and documented knowledge from one person to the other. The organi-
zation should support the interpersonal exchange of knowledge and it has to ensure that
this transfer actually leads to a gain of knowledge. Quality management of the contents
and processes of the knowledge management is only one critical issue here.
2.2
Promotors and Barriers of Knowledge Management
Several individual, technical as well as organizational factors do inﬂuence knowledge
transfer processes in an organization [1–3]. On the one hand, they can promote and
support knowledge transfer, on the other hand, negative values of these factors can also
turn to barriers regarding the processes of knowledge management (cf. Table 1 for
examples of promoters and barriers). High values of the promoting factors and low
values of the impairing barriers are optimal for an effective knowledge transfer.
2.3
Evaluation Method for Knowledge Management
The evaluation method applies an explanatory sequential design as suggested by
Creswell and Plano Clark [4]. This design belongs to the group of “Mixed Method
Designs”. These designs involve the collection, analysis, and integration of quantitative
and qualitative data in a single or multiphase study. Accordingly, the evaluation starts
with collecting and analyzing quantitative data in order to identify hot spots, followed
by an in-depth qualitative analysis of these hot spots.

The quantitative analysis is designed as a generic approach supporting the devel-
opment of a questionnaire referring to promoters and barriers of knowledge manage-
ment as known from research (cf. Table 1). This questionnaire identiﬁes and evaluates
these promoters and barriers on each level – individual, technical and organizational –
and in each phase of knowledge transfer – elicitation, documentation and actual use of
knowledge. Furthermore, the questionnaire addresses aspects of the implementation
process of knowledge management tools in the organization and their actual use.
Thereby, knowledge management relevant hot spots (e.g. problems) are identiﬁed.
In-depth data analysis is supported by guidelines for interviews. On the one hand,
these interviews should be conducted in order to deepen and to substantiate ques-
tionnaire’s ﬁndings regarding problems in the knowledge transfer processes. On the
other hand, ideas and suggestions for improvements can be developed in a participatory
way based on the interviews.
Additionally, the method supports the interpretation of the data and the derivation of
speciﬁc measures for optimizing the organization’s knowledge management processes.
Improvements should address reductions of the barriers and a support of the promoters –
on each stage and in each phase of knowledge transfer processes. A periodic monitoring
of the measures’ effects ensures continuous improvement of knowledge transfer in the
organization.

Elicitation of Tacit Knowledge
The increasing complexity and division of labor in safety critical systems make
cooperation of experts more and more needed, but also demanding. Thus, the coop-
eration of experts has become a crucial success factor in such systems. Within this
cooperation, collective tacit knowledge evolves. Collective tacit knowledge evolves
from the cooperation of different experts and hence from the interaction of different
individuals’ tacit knowledge when aiming to achieve a common objective. When the
same people work together over a long time period, team-speciﬁc patterns of coop-
eration (routines) are creeping in [5]. Over time, team members individually and often
unconsciously develop speciﬁc expectations regarding the cooperation within the team.
According to the distributed situation awareness theory [6], the compatibility of the
team members’ mutual expectations are paramount for successful cooperation and,
thus, are key elements of collective tacit knowledge. A lack of systematic maintenance
of collective tacit knowledge may cause disruptions in cooperation (e.g. unintentional
misunderstandings), especially in case of staff ﬂuctuation.
In close cooperation with Swiss NPPs a method for systematic elicitation of tacit
knowledge was developed and pilot tested. Elicitation means according to the
SECI-Model of Nonaka and Takeuchi [7] to grasp and to document experience-based
knowledge of experts – that is tacit and therefore difﬁcult to articulate – in a systematic
way that enables further use. The method addresses both, individual as well as col-
lective tacit knowledge.
The method involves a pre- as well as a post-job workshop and a systematic
exchange during job execution (cf. Fig. 1). The three phases build on one another
thereby following an approach of stepwise deepening. The method’s aims are to
Managing Tacit Knowledge in Safety Critical Systems
33

support (a) the stepwise elicitation of individual and collective tacit knowledge, (b) the
development of individual as well as collective learnings derived from the cooperation
experienced in the team, and (c) the derivation of concrete measures to promote the
interpersonal knowledge exchange as well as to improve the cooperation in the team.
The pre-job workshop is a workshop with all members of a team the working
process of which is subject of the method’s application. The aims are (a) the ﬁrst-time
elicitation of individual as well as collective tacit knowledge and (b) the documentation
of the elicited knowledge using speciﬁc template cards. The workshop’s methodology
is based on group discussions [8] as well as on the principles of storytelling [9], group
storytelling [10], causal mapping [11], and the self-q-technique [12]. According to
these methods, tacit knowledge can be elicited by generating story-like narratives as
well as by a stepwise question-based deepening approach.
In the ﬁrst workshop-part individual tacit knowledge is elicited by discussing a ﬁc-
titious but realistic scenario (a short-term absence of an experienced team member and its
replacement with an unexperienced colleague) facilitated by reﬂection-promoting ques-
tions. In the second workshop-part the team’s collective tacit knowledge is elicited. In
detail, implicit mutual expectations as well as uncertainties regarding the cooperation in
theteam areelicited usingquestion-guidedgroupdiscussions.Theelicited expectationsas
well as uncertainties are documented in the form of messages between team members
using speciﬁc template cards.
The systematic exchange during job execution contains an exchange and answering
of the messages developed in the pre-job workshop. Therefore, three short interviews
(10–15 min) with each team member are conducted. The aims of the systematic
exchange and the short interviews are (a) to recognize and to deal with incompatible
expectations among team members, (b) to resolve uncertainties regarding upcoming
cooperation, and (c) to develop and document individual learnings regarding past
cooperation in the team. The interviews are based on interview guidelines.
The post-job workshop builds on the elaborated content in the ﬁrst two phases
(elicited knowledge, exchanged and answered messages). The aims are (a) to derive
individual and collective learnings from the elicited knowledge as well as from the
cooperation experienced in the working process and (b) to deﬁne concrete measures to
promote the interpersonal knowledge exchange as well as to improve the cooperation
within the team. Therefore, in a moderated group discussion along speciﬁc questions,
collective as well as individual learnings are elicited and documented. Based on these
Fig. 1. The three steps of the knowledge elicitation method: Pre-job workshop, short-interviews
during job execution, post-job workshop.

learnings concrete (individual as well as collective) measures to promote the knowl-
edge exchange as well as to improve the cooperation within the team are derived. These
measures are to be implemented in the next teams’ working processes.
The testing has shown that the method supports the elicitation and systematic
cultivation of individual as well as collective tacit knowledge in a moderated process.
Thereby, it supports (a) the exchange of valuable tacit knowledge among team
members, (b) the cooperation awareness between team members, and (c) the early
recognition of incompatible mutual expectations as well as uncertainties regarding the
cooperation in the team. This enables taking proactive measures to avoid disruptions in
cooperation, especially in case of staff ﬂuctuation. Furthermore, the method delivers
valuable tips to be included into the organization’s knowledge management process.

Conclusions
Knowledge management is far more than maintaining a data base. This is because
knowledge is not primarily “a piece of paper” but an expertise growing in the humans’
heads over years of experience. In its core knowledge management refers to the
deliberately managed process of transferring such expertise “from heads to heads”.
This involves three phases: Eliciting relevant knowledge from heads, documenting this
knowledge in an appropriate manner, and making use of the knowledge, i.e. making
sure both, it is transferred to other person and it is of use for their work. Implementing
these three phases is especially difﬁcult for tacit knowledge be it on individual as well
as on collective level.
To support knowledge management, this research addressed gaps in existing
knowledge management practices. Two main gaps were identiﬁed. First, there are a lot
of knowledge management processes and instruments in place (e.g. wikis, databases,
standard operation procedures, focus group meetings, mentoring systems, etc.).
However, these systems are often likely to underperform. Second, especially referring
tacit knowledge there is little systematic support. On the level of individual tacit
knowledge transfer often depends on personal style; e.g. some seniors strongly support
juniors by taking time to share their experiences; other seniors hardly talk or document
something. On the level of collective tacit knowledge instruments of knowledge
transfer are largely lacking.
Regarding the performance of knowledge management processes and instruments
an evaluation method was developed taking a broad view; i.e. considering inﬂuencing
factors on individual, technical, as well as organizational level. This includes individual
motivation as well as the respective instruments’ usability, the culture respective
processes are embedded in or the approach of their implementation. The method fol-
lows a two steps design. First, a quantitative analysis allows for identifying strengths
and weaknesses in the given knowledge processes and instruments. Such, hot spots for
improvement are identiﬁed. Second, in-depth qualitative analysis on the base of
semi-structured interviews allow for detail analysis and development of concrete
measures for improvement. The method was pilot tested and proved to deliver valuable
insight for the respective company.
Managing Tacit Knowledge in Safety Critical Systems
35

Regarding knowledge elicitation, a structured process for teams was developed that
focuses on both, individual as well as collective tacit knowledge. The latter deliberately
makes explicit team speciﬁc patterns of cooperation that – more or less consciously –
creeped in over time of working together in the same team constellation. Such, that
method makes implicit mutual expectations explicit and hence avoids disruptions in
cooperation. The method furthermore supports a systematic derivation of individual as
well as joint learnings. The method was also pilot tested. It did not only deliver
valuable insights but was also greatly adopted by the participants.
Both methods did positively support the industrial partners’ knowledge manage-
ment. However, future research is required especially regarding collective tacit
knowledge. By focusing on team speciﬁc implicit cooperation patterns and synergic
acting of team members it is possible to conceptualize collective tacit knowledge, going
beyond the mere sum of individuals’ tacit knowledge. Nevertheless, a more differen-
tiated understanding of distributed tacit knowledge as a property of a social system is
an endeavor worth to work on.

Abstract. The twenty-ﬁrst century has seen many changes, together with
improvements in health and safety performance in some sectors. These improve‐
ments are testimony that the combined eﬀects of regulatory enforcement, proac‐
tive leadership and investments in safety technology are bringing in some tangible
beneﬁts overall. However; organisational accidents still occur, raising the ques‐
tion of whether key learnings from previous disasters are used for informing
organisational health and safety management practices. This paper, based on an
analysis of ﬁndings from the Mocando Well Blowout and Fukushima Disasters,
seeks to explore this very research question. This paper ﬁrst discusses key factors
identiﬁed in reports of the above disasters, followed by an introduction to organ‐
isational learning. Safety through organisational learning is proposed as a method,
and a number of suggestions made for advancing research and practice in safety
management through these approaches in the general industry.

Twenty-First Century Safety Management Challenges
Organizations in the twenty-ﬁrst century are being challenged on a number of fronts.
Some of those identiﬁed below arise from technological changes:
• rapid pace of changes in technology occurring at such speeds that engineering tech‐
niques required to cope with their associated risks are unable to keep up [1],
• new hazards and risks being created from a combination of dependency on informa‐
tion systems, incorrect or loss of information, digitalisation, and new forms work
organisations [1, 2],
• increasing complexity and coupling of organisational systems, with systems being
designed with signiﬁcant potential interactions among the diﬀerent components that
cannot be fully planned, understood, anticipated or guarded against [1, 3],
• more complex relationships between humans and automation, arising from humans
sharing control of automated decision-making platforms resulting in new types of
errors [1, 4],
• the changing perspectives on accident/incident causation from events, sequences,
systems, systemic and functional resonance [2, 5].

One could argues these are likely to impact more on some parts of the industry,
including those that are very large, operate with very high levels of technology and
operate in multiple sectors. Other challenges arise from changes to organisation and
work and impact on general, mainstream and contemporary industries. Some of these,
for example, include:
• decline in manufacturing industries and rise in knowledge-based and service indus‐
tries [6, 7],
• changes in the techniques, technologies and skills employed at work, resulting in
increases in occupations requiring either very high levels of skills or relatively few
skills [6, 8],
• changes in labour market, resulting in increased sub-contracting, part-time, self-
employment and temporary employments [7, 9]
• more companies are operating globally, resulting in increased pricing and product
competition [9, 10]
• product and service demands are shifting rapidly amidst pressure for higher quality
and customized products [11, 12], and
• an aging and increasingly diverse workforce and tightening labour markets [11].
Both challenges impact the way organizations manage health and safety, as they not
only need to deal with existing but also emergent hazards and risks, and amidst a range
of uncertain environments and contexts.
If one used some set of statistics, they would argue (perhaps quite rightly), that much
progress has been made in improving safety performance in many countries. For
example, between 2010 and 2015, work-related fatalities decreased from 228 to 194 in
Australia [13], with similar trends observed from New Zealand (77 to 43) [14] and Great
Britain (175 to 142) [15]. These improvements can be attributed to a combination of
increased enforcement by safety regulators, proactive approaches by safety leaders in
organisations, adoption of improved safety technology, and changes to reporting and
analysis systems. However, many practitioners would also argue that much more that
needs to be done because organisational accidents impacting on the lives of many people
continue to occur in both developed and developing countries. In the next section two
organisational accidents which have not only made news in recent years, but continue
to interest many researchers, practitioners and policy makers are brieﬂy reviewed. A
number of other, similar accidents are also brieﬂy summarised.

Mocando Well Blowout and Nuclear Disasters
The Mocando well blowout and Fukushima disasters are two notable organisational

The Macondo Well Blowout
The Macondo well blowout, explosion and ﬁre on the Deepwater Horizon oﬀshore
drilling rig on April 20, 2010; resulted in 11 workers being killed and another 16 seri‐
ously injured, with an estimated 5 million barrels of hydrocarbons released into the Gulf
of Mexico over a period of three months after the disaster [16, 17]. A number of factors
have been suggested to contribute to this disaster, including
i. a very small margin of safety between the fracture mud weight and the mud weight
necessary to avoid ﬂow into the well;
ii. great diﬀerence in density between the two types of cements used in the pumping
sequence of the cement casing of the walls when preparing the well for temporary
abandonment,
iii. incorrect interpretations of the negative pressure tests when assessing the integrity
of the cement casing,
iv. continued displacement of drilling mud with seawater following the incorrect
interpretation,
v. inability of sensors to detect and control hydrocarbon following previous failure
of the cement and mechanical barriers,
vi. the emergency blowout preventer (BOP) and blind shear ram (BSR) systems
failing to disconnect the oil rig from the well,
vii. design, testing, operation and maintenance of BOP not being consistent with high-
reliability, fail-safe design,
viii. misplaced trust by government and industry leaders on the ability of BOP to act
as a fail-safe mechanism,
ix. complex structure and division of expertise in the design, operations and mainte‐
nance of the overall operations,
x. inadequate management processes,
xi. not using a comprehensive systems approach for managing the safety aspects of
the operations,
xii. limited safety training provided to operations personnel, and
xiii. lack of a strong safety culture [16–18].
2.2
Fukushima Nuclear Disaster
The Fukushima nuclear disaster occurred on March 11, 2011 has been acknowledged
as the second most serious one in the nuclear industry after Three Mile Island [19]. A
major earthquake and tsunami, which resulted in the death of three employees, preceded
the disaster [20]. By March 2015 over 15,000 were killed, over 6000 injured and 2500
people were still reported as missing [21]. In addition, about 150,000 people were evac‐
uated, 173 workers exposed to more than 100 millisieverts of radiation while dealing
with the disaster, and some 1 8000 km2 of land in Fukushima Prefecture contaminated
by an accumulative dose greater than 5 millisieverts per year [20]. Some of the main
factors which has been suggested to have contributed to this disaster include:

i. inadequate corporate governance by key stakeholders,
ii. inadequate risk assessments and lack of safeguards against known threats,
iii. inadequate levels of knowledge, training, and equipment inspection related to
severe accidents,
iv. inadequate emergency response training and preparedness,
v. ineﬀective crisis management system due to ambiguities in roles and responsibil‐
ities between regulators and responsible agencies,
vi. negligence and failure by regulators’ to implement adequate measures against a
nuclear disaster,
vii. inadequate regulatory oversight by regulators and government,
viii. a lip service policy of ‘safety ﬁrst’, and
ix. a failure to follow international best practice standards [22–24].
While these disasters occurred over 5 to 6 years ago, have things improved, both in
the above, or other similar sectors of the industry? Table 1 summarises examples of a
number of other organisational accidents which have occurred between 2011 and 2016.

The occurrence of these, and other similar organisational accidents that have
occurred elsewhere suggests that many organisations continue to fail to learn from events
of the past.

A Failure to Learn the Right Lessons
The argument that organisations fail to learn is nothing new as shown by previous
organisational disasters such as the Challenger [28], Titanic [29], Sago Coal Mine [30];
as well with Macondo [31] and Fukushima [24]. What is repeatedly found in reports
following these types of disasters is that there were always failures to learn from earlier
and minor events which preceded the disasters. What we also need to ask, is whether
organisations are learning the right lessons from these disasters? This is an important
question to consider for both academic and pragmatic reasons.
3.1
Organisational Learning
Organisational learning (OL) was originally conceptualized by Argyris [32] and gained
prominence in the 1990s. The high level of interest has been linked with the publication
of The Fifth Discipline [33]. Since then it has received much attention in studies
involving, for example sustainability [34] and culture [35, 36]. While many studies have
acknowledge that OL is an important, a clear deﬁnition of what this actually is does not
exist [37]. Some of its key characteristics have been suggested to include adaptations
[33, 38]; innovations, culture, process and routines [37, 39].
3.2
Organisational Learning and Safety
According to the OL literature, analysing and learning from events is important for
preventing future events. One suggested method for doing this involves safety through
organisation learning (SOL), initially developed for the German nuclear industry trialed
in the chemical industry [40]. The authors have suggested it facilitated OL by supporting
the process of analysing events, standardising how these analysis were conducted,
mobilising multidisciplinary expertise and knowledge, and creativity in the analysis. A
search of the published literature, however, suggests there has been little published on
SOL from mainstream industries; hence there is an opportunity for empirical research
on OL and safety. In order to advance such research, there are a number of questions
that can be posed. For example:
i. which type of events, incidents and/or occurrences should be analysed? One
common practice in organisations is to concentrate on those which have led a
fatality, serious or disabling injury. This focus on failures alone creates an impedi‐
ment to OL because successful events such as near-misses, dangerous occurrences
and other ‘successes’ are missed entirely [41]. Such events represent the ﬂip side
of failures and occur more often than failures, so it made more sense to understand
why and how these occurred [42],
ii. what should be learnt from the events, incidents and/or occurrences and analysis?
There is always a sequence of events preceding, during and following an occur‐
rence. Organisational disasters are usually complex events and involve some pre-
conditions, triggers, the event (or series of events) itself, an outcome, recovery and
learning [43], so it is important that the correct information is collected, coded,
Advancing Organisational Health and Safety Management
41

classiﬁed and described [41]. Because the ﬁnal outcome of OL is successful adap‐
tation, it then holds that such learning should aim at knowing and knowledge on:
a. what happened,
b. what to do,
c. what to look, and
d. what to expect in the future [42],
iii. when should the learning take place? The main focus of attention following organ‐
isational accidents and major disasters is around clean up, suppression of informa‐
tion ﬂow to the media and regulators. Eﬀorts of (any) learning are usually left after
some levels of inquiry or investigations have been completed. However, underlying
OL is the presence of a system for detecting, notifying and addressing unexpected
events which arise within the organisation, including those which contravene opera‐
tional practices, or are contrary to it’s norms and values [44]. In order to promote
OL, therefore, methods and tools need to be in place to enable an organisation
acquire, analyse and enable changes to be made in order to improve performance
on a continuous basis,
iv. who should learn? In most instances, where there is any reference to any learning
from incidents, the ultimate recipients are the operators themselves, as part of
behaviour and error control! OL, however, requires that members from all levels
are involved [45, 46].

Conclusion
Organisations in the twenty-ﬁrst century continue to experience a number of challenges,
and these can impact the way they manage health and safety. Amidst these challenges
improvements are being made in terms of reduced number of workplace fatalities.
However, because organisational disasters continue to occur, it is apparent that many
organisations are failing to learn the right lessons for advancing safety management from
the experiences of industries outside their sector. Organisational learning oﬀers an
opportunity to provide some redress, and this paper proposes a set of four key questions
that can be examined using SOL as a way of advancing research and practice in organ‐
isational safety management. Future works will seek to explore, examine and measure
some of these important research questions.

Abstract. Although it is clear that we must satisfy both economy and safety, we
sometimes place more emphasis on economy than safety, which leads to a critical
disaster or crash. The reason must be identiﬁed for the further enhancement of
safety. This study explored why one cannot satisfy both economy and safety. We
attempted to explain the reason using the collapse model of proper balance
between safety and economy (eﬃciency) induced by the following cognitive
biases: (i) mental accounting, (ii) loss aversion, and (iii) discount of safety. The
measure or remedy of this collapse of the proper balance between safety and
economy (eﬃciency) was proposed as (a) disclosure system, (b) commitment
approach to safety, and (c) mechanism design.

Introduction
Ideally and rationally, it goes without saying that we should make safety compatible
with economy. However, based on the analysis of cases of past disasters or crashes, it
is doubtful whether it is possible to reconcile economy and safety especially when the
related organization cannot help aiming at higher eﬃciency to maintain and sustain
organizational and managerial activities and protect employees. There are many cases
that led to a critical disaster due to the lack in the balance between safety and economy
and optimistically and unconsciously regard safety as less important than eﬃciency
(economy).
The JOC criticality disaster or Fukushima Daiichi disaster is included in such cases,
and such disasters or crashes are repeated in spite of some preventive measures taken
cautiously. In the JOC criticality disaster, the workers violated the job rule predeter‐
mined by Science and Technology Agency, Japan (limitation of mass and limitation of
shape during the manufacturing of uranium solution) in order to improve eﬃciency of
uranium solution process [1]. The workers optimistically and irrationally altered the
manufacturing process six times. This was also done not abruptly but gradually. During
this impermissible alteration, the safety of uranium manufacturing was made light of.
In other words, the JOC could not make safety compatible with eﬃciency (economy).

In the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant (NPP) disaster, only the problems and
deﬁciencies in Fukushima Daiichi NPP have been paid attention to by many researchers
and mass medium. Although the comparison of Fukushima Daiichi and Fukushima
Daini NPP is seldom conducted, it is important and useful to carry out a comparative
study between two NPPs. The operators in Fukushima Daini NPP managed to suppress
the outbreak of a disaster and eventually a signiﬁcant consequence. It is said that the
reason why Fukushima Daini NPP did not suﬀer from a severe damage like Fukushima
Daiichi is the height of sea embankment and the mechanism of cooling system (water-
cooling or air-cooling system). The unconscious and optimistic biases must have worked
when investing money for enhancing the safety of Fukushima Daiichi NPP. TEPCO
(Tokyo Electric Company) also did not attempt to reconcile safety and economy. The
compatibility of safety with economy is a very important issue in safety management.
In this manner, the collapse of balance between safety and eﬃciency (economy) can
sometime become a critical cause of disaster.
The aim of this paper was to discuss why one cannot satisfy both economy and safety.
An attempt was made to explain the collapse model of proper balance between safety
and economy (eﬃciency) induced by the following cognitive biases: (i) mental
accounting, (ii) loss aversion, and (iii) discount of safety. The measure or remedy of this
collapse of the proper balance between safety and economy (eﬃciency) was proposed
as (a) disclosure system, (b) commitment to safety, and (c) mechanism design that makes
use of judgment of Solomon by which king Solomon judged which of two women was
a true (genuine) mother of a baby.
2
Reasons Why Anomaly in Safety Management Occurs
It is well-understood that safety should be more important than economy (proﬁt or
eﬃciency) as far as we always behave rationally. In spite of this understanding, we
encounter a situation under which proﬁt or eﬃciency is paid more and more attention
than safety. Thaler [2–4] and Shiller [5] pointed out anomaly in economics, and showed
that we do not always behave rationally as Econ does. Such a situation leading to irra‐
tional behavior in safety sometimes becomes a trigger of critical crashes, collisions, or
disasters [1, 6–13]. This study discussed why one cannot satisfy both economy and
safety. An attempt was made to explain the reason why the collapse of proper balance
between safety and economy (eﬃciency) is induced by means of the following cognitive
biases: (i) mental accounting, (ii) loss aversion, and (iii) discount of safety.
2.1
Mental Accounting
According to Thaler [2–4], we tend to behave using multiple mental accounts for
diﬀerent kinds of resources. For example, we use diﬀerent monthly budgets (mental
accounting) for grocery shopping and eating out at restaurants. Therefore, we constrain
one kind of purchase when its budget has run out of its mental accounting while we do
not constrain the other kind of purchase when it does not run out of its mental accounting,
although both consumptions come from the same monthly income. Similarly, we tend
46
A. Murata and M. Moriwaka

to spend less money at the market when paying with cash than with credit cards, even
though both cash and credit card come from the same economic resource.
Decisions on purchase or consumption are aﬀected by the mental account that comes
to mind when deciding whether to consume their resources. Consumption of a ﬁxed
amount of money such as $100 of one’s own money is felt more painful when that
consumption is from a smaller rather than a larger mental account.
In this manner, mental accounting represents our irrational behavior that divides our
money into diﬀerent mental accountings, although rational behavior never classiﬁes our
money into diﬀerent mental accounts. Therefore, it can be assumed that there are mainly
two diﬀerent mental accounts, that is, mental accounting for making a proﬁt and that for
investing money for maintaining safety in an organizational or managerial activity. Such
an irrational behavior (separation of investment or money into two diﬀerent mental
accounts) can be a trigger of imbalanced state of more importance of economy or eﬃ‐
ciency than safety. In other word, it is likely that we unconsciously place more impor‐
tance on the eﬃciency or proﬁt than on the safety due to mental accounting, although
we know that the safety and the eﬃciency or proﬁt must be simultaneously satisﬁed.
2.2
Loss Aversion
Loss aversion [8] is well-known as our irrational behavior. We generally feel more
disappointed when we loose, for example, $100 than when we gain the same amount.
Therefore, we tend to be averse to economic or monetary loss especially when we are
constantly under an economically tough situation, which collapses the balance between
economy (proﬁt or eﬃciency) and safety [10]. In March 1977, a Boeing 747 KLM Flight
4805 left Amsterdam and was bound for Las Palmas Airport on the Canary Islands. A
terrorist bomb explosion occurred at a ﬂower shop in Las Palmas Airport, and so, the
ﬂight, along with a few others, was diverted to Tenerife Airport. After landing at the
airport, the ﬂight waited for clearance from the air traﬃc controller (ATC) to take oﬀ,
but because of reduced visibility due to fog at the airport, the clearance was delayed.
The captain, however, decided to take oﬀ without permission from the ATC, and he
turned the throttles to full power on the foggy runway. Unfortunately, a Pan Am 747
plane was parked across the runway as the KLM Flight 4805 approached it at take-oﬀ
speed. Although the captain attempted to avoid a collision by trying to take oﬀ as early
as possible, the underside of KLM ﬂight’s fuselage ripped through the Pan Am plane,
and the KLM plane burst into a ﬁery explosion. All crew and passengers of the KLM
plane and many passengers of the Pan Am plane lost their lives.
Loss aversion strongly contributed to the KLM Flight 4805 crash. In this case, the
losses for the captain of the ﬂight include a reduced mandated rest period due to the
ﬂight delay, the cost of accommodating the passengers at a hotel until the situation
improves and a series of consequences of the ﬂight delay, such as stress imposed on the
captain and a blot on the captain’s reputation of being punctual. The complicated inter‐
action of these factors probably triggered and escalated the captain’s feeling of loss
aversion. The more signiﬁcance we attach to potential loss, the more loss aversive we
tend to be. The captain must have been preoccupied with the urge to reach the destination
Anomaly in Safety Management
47

as early as possible and must have lost his sense of safety, resulting in his decision to
take oﬀ without clearance from the ATC.
2.3
Safety Discount
Discount of safety is also regarded as a cause of imbalance of safety and economy. As
well as the time discount of economic (monetary) items, it is pointed out that the value
of safety is also discounted [14]. The authors’ experimental data on the discount
phenomenon of safety are shown in Fig. 1. To get this data, the participants were required
to evaluate the distance to jump across (perceived risk) RS as a function of the time to
detour E when the length of precipice or gutter is equal to 1 m. As shown in Fig. 1, the
safety data can be modeled by a hyperbolic discount curve as in economic phenomenon.

Fig. 1. Discount phenomenon of safety.
The safety discount rate was higher when the perceived risk was lower (gutter) than
when the perceived risk was higher (precipice). This suggests that we tend to discount
safety to a larger extent when the perceived risk on safety is lower than when the
perceived risk on safety is higher. This shows that magnitude eﬀect [15] holds even in
the discount phenomenon of safety. Magnitude eﬀect suggests that the lower perceived
risk is, the more safety is discounted, which might induce the imbalance between safety
and eﬃciency. The imbalance between safety and economy makes us perceive the risk
on safety lower and becomes a trigger to pursuit economy by sacriﬁcing safety.
Irrational mental accounting tends to produce diﬀerent accounts for proﬁt and safety
pursuit. Under a managerially diﬃcult situation, we unconsciously tend to place more
emphasis on a proﬁt mental account, and avoid investing money on safety. We some‐
times get loss aversive, in particular, in pursuit of proﬁt. This, together with mental
accounting, further makes us place less emphasis on safety, feel less risky even if the
48
A. Murata and M. Moriwaka

risk is higher than that we actually feel, and discount safety. This eventually causes the
imbalance between eﬃciency and safety. In the next section, it is discussed how such
cognitive biases that make us unable to make safety compatible with proﬁt or economy.

Discussion: How Anomaly in Safety Management Should Be
Overcome
In Sect. 2, we inferred that the collapse of the proper balance between safety and
economy (eﬃciency) was caused mainly by three irrational factors (cognitive biases),
that is, mental accounting, loss aversion, and discount of safety.
The remedy of this collapse of the proper balance between safety and economy
(eﬃciency) was proposed as follows: (a) disclosure system, (b) commitment to safety,
and (c) mechanism design (that makes use of judgment of Solomon by which king
Solomon judged which of two women was a true (genuine) mother of a baby).
3.1
Disclosure System
It is generally believed that disclosure system reduces dishonesty or unethical behavior,
and eventually the violation of safety rules or regulations. Loewenstein et al. [16]
discussed the eﬀects of regulations that require public disclosure of information. These
requirements are most sensibly imposed in situations characterized by misaligned incen‐
tives and asymmetry of information between, for example, a regulation oﬃcer and safety
management staﬀ at workplace. The disclosure of information must be eﬀectively
carried out for the purpose of resolving the imbalance between safety and eﬃciency
(economy). The full-disclosure principle [17], for example, can prevent corporations
from guaranteeing even relatively low quality products caused by asymmetry of infor‐
mation. Here, asymmetry comes from the fact that producers or manufacturers know
more than consumers about their products.
It has been discussed how diﬀerent psychological factors complicate the appearance
of unethical behavior or violation of rules or regulations. Bounded awareness and biased
assessments of revelation probability of unethical behavior or violation on the part of
information recipients can signiﬁcantly diminish the intended eﬀectiveness of disclosure
requirements. These factors also become a trigger of cognitive biases [10, 18, 19]. In
many cases, without reducing the asymmetry of information, disclosure does not func‐
tion satisfactory between workers or safety management staﬀ at workplaces and the
safety regulation staﬀ or management of corporation. The asymmetry of information
between the workers and the safety regulation staﬀ or management prevents both groups
from sharing important information necessary for maintaining safety. Although the
disclosure of information is necessary to resolve the asymmetry of information between
providers and recipients, this does not necessarily works for the resolution of asymmetry
of information. Bateson [20] showed that cues of being watched enhance cooperation
in a real-world setting. Inferring from this study, the feeling of being watched at all times
must be eﬀective for preventing the imbalance between safety and eﬃciency as well as
frequent disclosure of information on safety.

The eﬀective and frequent disclosure of information, in particular, the safety and
economic or managerial investment must be conducted to resolve the asymmetry of
information between the workers at workplace and the safety regulation or management
staﬀ at workplace. With such a disclosure system, it would have been possible to prevent
JOC criticality disaster [1]. In this disaster, the workers violated the job rule (limitation
of mass and limitation of shape during the manufacturing of uranium solution) in order
to improve eﬃciency of uranium solution process. The information of this alteration
process was never shared between the regulation staﬀ and the workers. The workers
optimistically, irrationally, and gradually altered the manufacturing process six times
without being watched by the safety regulation staﬀ. JOC could not make safety compat‐
ible with eﬃciency (economy).
3.2
Commitment and Emotional Approach to Safety
Frank [17] proposed that commitment makes one’s behavior or act to something eﬀec‐
tive, and it was shown that emotion plays an important role in enhancing commitment.
Damasio [21, 22] found that emotion is essential for the rational decision making.
Commitment to safety with emotion must work for the prevention of imbalance between
safety and economy (or eﬃciency). Frank [17] also states that no amount of punishment
and reward seems suﬃcient to induce people to behave according to a rule without
emotional conditionality.
Homer’s Odysseus faced the situation to sail past dangerous reefs where sirens lay.
Because Odysseus realized that once he confronted with earshot of sirens’ cry, he would
be irresistibly sailed to his doom on the reefs, he was able to foresee the wrong behavior
and come up with eﬀective commitment to instruct his crew to strap him tightly to the
mast and not release him until they had sailed safely past. This commitment was not
possible without emotional conditionality. Similar commitment is seen, for example, in
whole-life insurance policies which impose substantial penalties on withdrawal before
retirement. The proper balance between the intelligence and the emotion must be essen‐
tial for the eﬀective work of commitment.
Frank [17] pointed out the eﬃcacy of the selﬂess act for the achievement of coop‐
eration, and oﬀered the need to further reﬁne the decision theory used in traditional
economics whereby materialist motives of self-interest are ascribed to the average
person weighing costs and beneﬁts for every economic action. In such a situation, safety
problems are neglected unconsciously, and it becomes impossible to make safety
compatible with economy. Therefore, the commitment to safety for prudential cooper‐
ation must be eﬀective. In the commitment to safety, as mentioned above, it is important
to clarify the role of the emotions in facilitating socially eﬃcient interactions and proper
decision making that does not induce the imbalance between safety and economy.
It is not so easy to learn the advantage of passing up the small and early reward
(temporally proﬁt) in favor of the large and later reward (everlasting safety) as shown
in Sect. 2.3. We tend to discount more largely to the small and early reward (short-term
managerial proﬁt) than to the large and later reward (safety at present and in the future).
It tends that we unconsciously place more emphasis on a proﬁt mental account than a
safety maintenance account, in particular, under a managerially diﬃcult situation. We
50

sometimes get loss aversive, in particular, in pursuit of proﬁt. This further makes us feel
less risky even if the risk is higher than that we actually perceive, and thus we discount
safety. This eventually causes the imbalance between eﬃciency and safety.
To cope with such a situation, commitment approach to safety with emotional condi‐
tionality would be one promising measure to prevent such willingness not to passing up
the small and early reward.
3.3
Mechanism Design
The Judgment of Solomon refers to a story in which King Solomon ruled between two
women both claiming to be the mother of a baby by tricking them into revealing their
true feelings. It has become an archetypal example of game-theoretical or mechanism
design argument of an impartial and fair judgment displaying wisdom in decision
making.
It is assumed that a government must conﬁrm the safety of nuclear power plant (NPP)
and decide whether the construction of NPP should be promoted or not. First of all, the
following symbols are deﬁned. mno: there are many safety concerns in the construction
of NPP (NPP is not safe). mNPP: there are no problems in the construction of NPP. It is
assumed that the government must judge which argument of Group A or Group B is
correct and reliable. The following events are deﬁned.
a. The argument of Group A is correct.
b. The argument of Group B is correct.
c. Both Group A and Group B are not correct, and cannot be relied upon.

As shown in Table 1, the government cannot know which argument is correct as it
is. Therefore, the mechanism design approach [23, 24] was applied to identify a genu‐
inely correct group. Group A and Group B know which insistence is correct. It is also
assumed that the insistence of Group A is genuinely correct. The value or satisfaction
accepted by a government is determined as follows.
VH: correctly insistent Group
VL:
incorrectly insistent Group, where VH > VL
.
Group A and Group B can be described as follows.
Group A (Safety: Assurance ⇒ Safety: Insistence): This group genuinely assure
safety (Safety: Assurance) ⇒ This group insists in public that their proposal is safe
(Safety: Insistence).
Group B (Safety: Non-assurance ⇒ Safety: Insistence): This group falsely assure
safety in spite of their proposal not assuring safety (Safety: Non-assurance) ⇒ This
group insists in public that their proposal is safe (Safety: Insistence).
Group A genuinely assures safety, and insists that their policy can surely attain
safety. Group B, on the surface, insists that their policy attains safety, although the group
knows that their policy cannot actually assure safety. In order to know which group is
genuinely correct, the following two-stage mechanism design is eﬀective.
If the insistence of both groups does not coincide, it is assumed that Safety: Assur‐
ance ⇒ Safety: Insistence (Group A) and Safety: Non-assurance ⇒ Safety: Insistence
(Group B) is punished by x and y, respectively. If Group A is correct, VH > y > VL. Group
B cannot help choosing mno as shown in Fig. 2 to suppress and minimize his or her loss.
Such a mechanism design enables us to choose a correct alternative. With such a mech‐
anism, it may be actually possible to make safety compatible with economy, because

makes us choose a correct alternative.

Group B must in advance pay y for the assurance of safety to promote the construction
of NPP with its own responsibility so that they don’t get trapped into loss aversion bias
and too much emphasize on eﬃciency. It is possible that such a mechanism design can
avoid the cognitive biases of discount of safety and mental accounting that becomes a
trigger of not willing to invest money for the assurance of safety.
The eﬀective disclosure and the commitment approach to safety with emotional
conditionality would work satisfactory if a mechanism design approach to promote such
measures is eﬀectively used. In this manner, one can make safety compatible with
eﬃciency or proﬁt.

Conclusions
The aim of this paper was to discuss why one cannot satisfy both economy and safety.
The results can be summarized as follows.
We inferred that the collapse of the proper balance between safety and economy
(eﬃciency) was caused mainly by three irrational factors, that is, mental accounting,
loss aversion, and safety discount. The remedy of this collapse of the proper balance
between safety and economy (eﬃciency) was proposed as (a) disclosure system, (b)
mechanism design, and (c) commitment of safety.

Abstract. The U.S. dairy industry has had consistently high rates of occupa-
tional injuries. Occupational health and safety management systems (OHSMSs)
have potential to reduce injury rates, but lacking a regulatory mandate for such a
system, it is uncertain if U.S. dairy farmers will adopt an OHSMS. Needs
assessment interviews were developed and validated to assess the attitudes,
experiences, and interests of dairy workers and managers about OHSMS
approaches to worker safety. Non-parametric statistical methods were applied to
determine whether there were differences between the mean responses of
workers and managers and whether their expressed attitudes and interests were
signiﬁcantly strong in favor or against OHSMSs. Thirty-two dairy workers and
four managers from four farms completed the interviews. There were no sig-
niﬁcant differences in attitudes or interests between dairy workers and man-
agement. Most of the attitudes and interests were strongly favorable of OHSMS
approaches, suggesting that dairy farmers may be willing to adopt an OHSMS
voluntarily.

Introduction
Occupational injuries and illnesses are common in the U.S. dairy production industry.
Between 2006 and 2015, the rate of injuries per 100 full-time workers averaged 5.7,
ranging from 3.9 to 7.3 [1]. This was higher than the average rates during the same
10-year span across all U.S. employment sectors and in the broader agriculture sector
speciﬁcally, which were 3.6 and 5.1, respectively [1]. Common hazards among dairy
farm workers include being crushed by cattle, contact with heavy machinery, ergo-
nomic stresses among workers who milk cows or handle calves, and respiratory
exposures [2].

Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing 604, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-60525-8_7

The causes of these events and conditions are multifactorial including direct, indi-
rect, and systemic risk factors. Important direct risk factors include insufﬁcient training,
poor ergonomic design of dairy equipment, and environmental exposures [3, 4].
A largely immigrant, migrant, non-English speaking workforce, many of whom have a
fear or distrust of government authorities are some important indirect risk factors for
occupational injury and illness among dairy farm workers [5]. Furthermore, the dairy
industry has historically been neglected by regulators responsible for occupational
health and safety (OHS), with fewer than 700 federal regulatory inspections having
occurred on dairies between 2003 and 2012 despite there being more than 45,000 U.S.
dairy farms in operation [6]. Systemic risk factors include a lack of training, lack of
standard operating procedures and poor leadership [3, 7].
Given the objectionably high rates of injuries and wide range of occupational
morbidities and risk factors, comprehensive risk management methods are needed to
protect workers employed on U.S. dairy farms. Occupational health and safety man-
agement systems (OHSMSs) have shown promise as a means to reduce overall injury
rates. Studies have demonstrated that voluntary OHSMSs in the U.S. can reduce
hazards, reduce costs, and reduce injuries in general [8, 9]. Unfortunately, little has
been published on whether these results are applicable to the dairy industry. An
Australian study published in 2011 evaluated how well different agriculture industries
had adopted OHSMS-like regulations [10]. The study revealed that dairy was one of
the highest performing agricultural industries (ranked third out of seven), but that fewer
than half had adopted a farm health and safety plan (39%) or provided introductory
safety training for farm workers (43%) [10]. In the U.S., it has been reported that pork
producers were willing to adopt OHSMSs, particularly when checklists and guides are
included [11]. In a 2016 study of U.S. dairy farms that had participated in a free
government health and safety consultation program, farms with higher levels of
OHSMS programming were generally associated with lower rates of injuries and ill-
nesses [12]. However, the study was correlational and observational in nature and
examined only coincident injury rates and OHSMS programming [12]. To date, no
OHSMS intervention studies have been published in the dairy industry, although a
replication study found similar associations in the poultry production industry [13].
One potentially important barrier to an OHSMS intervention program for dairies is
the acceptability of such an intervention for dairy farmers and farm workers. In the
U.S., there is no federal government mandate for businesses to adopt an OHSMS, and
few states require any type of systemic approach to worker safety. California is the
most noteworthy exception, having enacted an “Injury and Illness Prevention Program”
(IIPP) rule for most employers since 1991 [14]. However, employers with fewer than
20 employees are exempted from most of the IIPP requirements and most U.S. dairy
farms employ fewer than 20 people [14]. Thus, OHSMS adoption would be a voluntary
measure for most U.S. dairies, 95% of whom employ fewer than 20 workers [15].
The study presented here was conceived to ascertain whether U.S. dairy farmers and
farm workers would be interested and supportive of adopting a voluntary OHSMS. The
objectives of this work were to measure the attitudes toward, experiences with, and interest
in, systemic OHSMS approaches among U.S. dairy workers and employers. The needs
assessment results should provide evidence for or against the development of an OHSMS
intervention to reduce occupational injuries and illnesses among dairy farm workers.

Methods
2.1
Interview Instruments
A needs assessment interview instrument was developed to assess the attitudes,
experiences, and interests of dairy workers and dairy managers/owners as they relate to
systemic approaches to occupational health and safety. The worker instrument con-
sisted of eight questions on attitudes that used a four-point forced-choice scale, eight
experience questions that used yes or no answers, and seven more four-point scale
questions about how interested dairy workers were in participating in OHSMS-related
activities. The scaled responses to interview questions about attitudes and interests
were worded as 0 = strongly disagree or very disinterested; 1 = slightly disagree or
somewhat disinterested; 2 = slightly agree or somewhat interested; and 4 = strongly
agree or very interested, respectively.
A second interview instrument was developed for dairy owners and managers. This
instrument had the same number of questions on attitudes and experiences, but had six
additional questions assessing interests. The additional questions focused on man-
agement aspects of systematic occupational health and safety, such as demonstrating
support for safety, getting workers involved in safety, and contractor safety.
Both interview instruments were assessed for content validity using an expert
opinion panel. This panel of national expert reviewers included researchers experienced
with dairy health and safety, OHSMSs, and dairy management. Each one of these
experts provided their opinions on the interview instruments and offered suggestions for
improvement. In addition, we had a dairy owner and a dairy worker review and evaluate
their relevant instruments. This preliminary validation (face, consensual, and content
validity) is consistent with methods used to develop interview instruments for medical
services needs assessments [16], and education research assessments [17]. Neither the
criterion validity nor the reliability of the interview instruments was assessed.
Both interview instruments were written in English. They were then translated into
Spanish by an independent third party. A Spanish-speaking former dairy worker and a
bi-lingual dairy management researcher veriﬁed the accuracy of the translated interview
instruments.
2.2
Subject Recruitment and Interview Process
A convenience sample of four dairy farms in a western U.S. state that had participated
in a local university extension program on dairy management in 2014 was targeted for
this study. The sample represented a variety of dairy farm sizes that included small
(100 to 999 head of cattle), medium (1,000 to 2,499 head), and large (2,500 + head,
according to National Agriculture Statistics Service classiﬁcations), and a variety of
processes (organic and non-organic) [18]. A bi-lingual member of the research team
visited each farm and interviewed all of the available workers and either the farm owner
(for smaller farms) or the farm general manager (for larger farms). Dairy farm workers
and owners/managers were approached using an Institutional Review Board Approved
recruitment script. All participants were interviewed in either English or Spanish
Needs and Opportunities for Applying Voluntary OHSMS

depending on which language was preferred. Resource limitations prevented additional
dairy farm visits within the study period. The subject recruitment and interview process
was conducted according to methods approved by the Colorado State University
Institutional Review Board.
2.3
Data Analysis
The goals of the data analyses in this study were (1) to examine if there were any
signiﬁcant differences in the opinions of dairy workers and owners/managers; and
(2) to determine if the opinions of dairy farm workers and management were con-
vincingly strong for or against a number of aspects related to an OHSMS.
The ﬁrst goal was assessed using a two-sided Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test for con-
cordant items on the worker and owner/manager interview instruments. The null
hypothesis was that there was no difference between the mean score of either group for
a particular question.
The second goal was assessed by analyzing the responses to attitude and interest
questions from workers and owners/managers using a one-sided, one-sample sign test.
The null hypothesis was set to a value of 3 out of 4 for each question included in the
analysis. If the median response was signiﬁcantly greater than three for a question, then
that was considered evidence of a signiﬁcantly strong opinion in favor of that particular
construct of an OHSMS. If the mean response was not signiﬁcantly strong, then a
second one-sample sign test was conducted using a null of two and a less-than alter-
native. This would be considered strong evidence against a particular interview item.
Non-parametric statistics were employed to address both goals because the inter-
view items cannot be considered interval or ratio scale, which precluded the use of
other analyses. Minitab 17 Statistical Software (State College, PA, U.S.A.) was used to
perform all analyses in this study.

Participant Demographics
Thirty-two farm workers and four owners/managers participated in the interviews from
four dairy farms. The farms included a large organic dairy and a large non-organic
dairy, a medium-sized non-organic dairy, and a small non-organic dairy farm. No one
refused to participate in the study.
Of the 32 dairy workers who participated in this study, 23 were male (72%) and all
of the workers who reported their country of origin (25/32, 78%) were born outside of
the U.S. The most common country of origin reported was Mexico (15/25 reporting,
60%) followed by Guatemala and El Salvador (3/25 reporting, 12% each); Ukraine
(2/25 reporting, 8%); and Peru and China (1/25 reporting, 4% each). All of the seven
workers who did not report a country of origin spoke Spanish, resulting in a total of
29 out of 32 dairy worker respondents who completed the interviews in Spanish (91%).
The mean age of the worker participants was 34.6 years (range 19 to 64 years) among
the 24 who reported their age.

Of the four dairy owners/managers who participated, one was an owner and three
were farm general managers. Three of the four owners/managers (75%) completed their
interviews in English. Only two of the four owners/managers (50%) provided an age.
The average reported age was 33.5 years, ranging from 30 to 37 years.

Interview Results
Attitudes Toward Systematic OHS. In the ﬁrst portion of the interviews, dairy farm
workers and owners/managers were asked how strongly they agreed or disagreed with
seven statements about systematic approaches to OHS. The individual questions and
the responses of worker and owner/manager participants are summarized in Table 1.
During the instrument validation process, an eighth item was added to this section.
The results of this question are presented separately because it did not speciﬁcally
gauge an attitude toward systematic OHS. The mean response to the eighth statement “I
know where to ﬁnd information about workplace safety issues”, was 2.8 (range 1 to 4)
for both workers and owners/managers.
Experiences with Systematic OHS. In the second portion of the interviews, partici-
pants were asked if they had experience with any of eight OHSMS-related behaviors in
the previous year. Among the 32 dairy worker participants, 17 (53%) indicated they
had performed preventive maintenance on farm equipment; 20 (63%) had found and
ﬁxed workplace safety hazards; 6 (19%) had participated in farm safety inspections;

23 (72%) had received safety training; 16 (50%) had reported safety concerns to their
supervisor; 17 (53%) had discussed safety concerns with other workers; 10 (31%) had
suffered a workplace injury; and 12 (38%) had reported a workplace injury to their
supervisor.
Among the four participating dairy owners/managers, 2 (50%) indicated they had
attended training or conferences on worker safety; 4 (100%) had identiﬁed and con-
trolled workplace safety hazards; 3 (75%) had conducted farm safety inspections; 2
(50%) had provided farm safety training to workers; 2 (50%) had documented a
workplace injury; 4 (100%) had communicated safety concerns to workers; 3 (75%)
had discussed farm safety concerns with colleagues and/or other farmers; and 2 (50%)
had created farm safety goals for their farm.
Interest in OHSMS Approaches. In the ﬁnal part of the interviews, dairy farm
workers and owners/managers were asked how interested they were in participating in
(for workers) or learning more about (for owners/managers) several OHSMS-related
activities. Dairy workers were asked seven questions in this section and management
participants were asked 12. The individual activities and participant responses are
summarized in Table 2.

An additional question was added to this section for owners/managers during the
instrument validation process. Owners/managers only were asked, “How concerned are
you about OSHA regulations and inspections.” Possible responses ranged from 1 = not
at all concerned, 2 = a little concerned, 3 = somewhat concerned, and 4 = very con-
cerned. The mean rating of management participants was 3.3 out of 4 (range 2 to 4).

Comparison Between Workers and Owners/Managers
There were no signiﬁcant differences between the ratings of dairy workers and dairy
owners/managers on any of the concordant attitude and interest interview questions, as
assessed using a Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test. However, one of the attitude statements and
four of the interest questions could not be assessed using this method because there was
no variability in the owner/manager responses. The results of these comparative
analyses are provided in Tables 3 and 4.

Strength of Opinions
The mean dairy worker rating on six of the eight attitude statements was signiﬁcantly
higher than a three out of four (p < 0.05 for all six statements). The two statements
which were not were “Worker safety needs improvement on my farm”, (mean 3.2,
p = 0.057) and “I know where to ﬁnd information about workplace safety issues”,
(mean 2.8, p 0.74). These two statement ratings were also not signiﬁcantly less than a
two out of four.
Similarly, the mean dairy worker ratings for ﬁve of the seven interest activities were
signiﬁcantly above a three out of four (p < 0.05). The two interest activities that were
not rated signiﬁcantly above a three were “creating safety goals and objectives for your
farm” (mean 3.2, p = 0.09), and “investigating the cause of a workplace injury” (mean
3.2, p = 0.20). Neither of the statements was rated signiﬁcantly below a two out of four.
None of the management attitude statement mean ratings were signiﬁcantly positive
(greater than 3) or negative (less than 2), with a range of p = 0.063 to p = 0.750.

Discussion
Mean responses to all of the attitude statements among dairy farm workers and man-
agement were positive, and worker ratings on six out of the eight statements were
signiﬁcantly strong (above a three out of four). These ﬁndings indicate that participants
had a generally favorable opinion of systematic approaches to OHS. Further, there were
no signiﬁcant differences between the average attitude ratings of dairy workers and
owners/managers, suggesting there are similarities between these groups in terms of
desire for systematic OHS approaches. This is encouraging because OHSMS regula-
tions are lacking in the U.S. and OHS regulatory attention in the industry has been

generally sparse. Thus, any adoption of an OHSMS in the dairy industry would need to
be voluntary.
Participants from both groups also indicated that there was a lack of knowledge in
terms of being able to ﬁnd available OHS information, as evidenced by it rating the
lowest out of all of the statements and being the only statement with a mean rating
below a three out of four. Providing information to dairy workers and management may
therefore be a good ﬁrst step when considering potential OHSMS interventions in the
U.S. dairy industry.
Responses to the experience questions among workers and owners/managers pro-
vide insight into OHSMS-related activities already being accomplished on dairy farms,
which could make OHSMS interventions more accessible. Half or more of the dairy
worker participants had performed preventive maintenance, ﬁxed hazards, reported
safety concerns to a supervisor, and received safety training. Notably, over 30% of
worker respondents reported being injured on the job in the previous year. While
attempting to assess the injury experience of dairy workers was not a focus of this
study, the high proportion is consistent with ﬁndings from a previous study that found a
16.6% per year injury rate among 600 dairy workers, which was substantially higher
than U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports over that same time period and the result is
indicative of the need for OHS related interventions for dairy farm workers [15]. It was
a surprise to see that more workers reported an injury to their supervisor (38%) than
had experienced an injury (30%). This discrepancy may be due to how the interview
question was worded. The question about reporting an injury did not specify a worker’s
own injury, and therefore the result may have included workers reporting injuries to
themselves and their fellow workers.
Dairy owners/managers also reported experience with a number of OHSMS-related
activities. Fifty percent or more participants indicated they had experience with each
one of the eight experience questions in the previous year. These worker and man-
agement experiences can be used to tailor an acceptable OHSMS intervention for dairy
farms that builds upon practices that may already be in place.
Worker and management participants also indicated an overall strong interest in
participating in (for workers) or learning more about (for owners/managers) OHSMS
approaches to OHS. All interest activities had a mean response above a three out of
four, and ﬁve out of the seven worker rating averages were signiﬁcantly above a three,
indicating that they were very interested in participating in most of the OHSMS-related
activities. Again, a high degree of agreement between workers and management was
indicated by the lack of any signiﬁcant differences between the interest ratings of the
two groups. However, a lack of variability among the owner/manager responses limited
this analysis to only three of the seven corresponding interest questions.
4.1
Limitations and Strengths
Several important limitations should be considered when interpreting the results of this
study. Conducting interviews on only four farms in a single U.S. state largely limits the
degree to which the participants can be considered representative of the larger U.S.
dairy industry population. In addition, because farms were selected based on their
Needs and Opportunities for Applying Voluntary OHSMS
63

managements’ participation in a local university extension program focused on dairy
management, these farms may be different from those that did not participate in these
programs, especially with regard to owner/manager beliefs and opinions. The small
sample size also limited our ability to analyze similarities and differences between
workers and management on some items, and to statistically assess the strength of
opinions in the management group. In ﬁve separate instances, there was too little
variability in the management responses to allow for a rank-based non-parametric
comparison with the worker responses. Further, the small sample size increased the
likelihood that random chance could explain any observed ﬁndings. The lack of
quantitative psychrometric data on the criterion validity and reliability of the interview
instruments is another important limitation of this study. While this was a small needs
assessment study that did not require any additional instrument analyses, these should
be considered before the instruments are adopted for other research in other contexts.
There were also several strengths of this study. In particular, the needs assessment
included the opinions of both dairy workers and management. This is critical because
management support and employee participation are commonly considered to be
important determinants of OHSMS success [19, 20]. Another strength was that the
interviews were conducted in Spanish and English to match the preferred language of
most participants. The interview instruments were also validated by national experts on
dairy management, OHSMS, and agricultural OHS research. Finally, this is the ﬁrst
study to document the attitudes, experiences, and interests of U.S. dairy personnel with
regard to a comprehensive risk management approach to OHS.
5
Conclusion
There are four main conclusions that can be drawn from this study. First, the overall
attitudes of participant dairy workers and owner managers toward systematic OHS
were generally positive. Second, dairy workers and owners/managers who participated
in this study had experience with a number of OHSMS-related activities. Third, dairy
workers and owners/managers were generally interested in participating in and learning
more about OHSMS approaches to OHS. And lastly, there were no signiﬁcant dif-
ferences between the opinions of dairy workers and dairy owners/managers who par-
ticipated in this study.
Although the limitations of this study prevent extrapolation of our ﬁndings to the
dairy industry as a whole, the results provide additional evidence that OHSMS inter-
ventions may be appropriate to attempt to reduce the rate of injuries and illnesses among
U.S. dairy workers. This study should help to inform the design of intervention studies
for dairy farms by highlighting areas where some dairy personnel have experience with
and interests in OHSMS-related activities and areas where there is potential agreement
between dairy workers and managers. Further research is needed to determine if the
opinions of our participants are similar to those in the broader U.S. dairy industry.
U.S. dairy producers who employ fewer than 250 workers and are interested in
establishing an OHSMS can request free, conﬁdential assistance through the OSHA
On-Site Consultation Program. Larger producers interested in an OHSMS can ﬁnd
consultant services through the national organizations of OHS professionals.

Abstract. During the process of construction, accidents may happen in diﬀerent
ways. In this paper, we ﬁrstly review the literature related to the asymmetric
information on construction site. Next, the author will report some interviews and
questionnaires used to study the causes of construction accidents that happen in
diﬀerent types of buildings (such as building sites, bridges and tunnels). The
author will draw a conclusion at the end of the paper to summarize the causes of
construction accidents in diﬀerent kinds of buildings.

Introduction
Construction safety is a critical issue in the process of construction. Guo, Yu, and Skit‐
more [4] suggested that the construction safety issue has become more popular in recent
years because of the high accident and death rates. The Labour Department of the Hong
Kong Government’s ‘Summary of Occupational Safety and Health Statistics of 1st Three
Quarters of 2016’ has been published and shows that industrial accidents in the construc‐
tion industry increased by 0.7% in the 1st three quarters of 2016 compared with the 1st
three quarters of 2015 (Table 1).
There is a critical need to collect data on the construction industry in detail to study
the major risk elements in detail in order to provide some suggestions and make
improvements. In this paper, we will report the causes of construction accidents in
diﬀerent types of buildings and ﬁnd out the major risk elements for construction acci‐
dents. Firstly, the author will present a literature review of the asymmetric information
held by diﬀerent stakeholders in construction sites. Secondly, the causes of accidents in
various types of building structures (including skyscrapers, bridges, tunnels, etc.) will
be determined from the feedback from surveys and interviews. The author summarizes
the main causes of accidents on construction sites. Thirdly, the author makes some
suggestions according to the data collected by the questionnaire and interviews. Last
but not least, the author will draw a conclusion on the research.

Review of the Causes of Accidents in the Construction Industry
2.1
Causes of Accidents in the Construction Industry
There are many causes that lead to accidents in the construction industry. Hon, Chan,
and Wong [5] believed that accidents are caused by the lack of working competence,
poor behaviour, poor equipment or misuse of equipment, lack of training, etc. Misiurek
and Misiurek [9] realized that human errors, instead of technical errors, are the major
reasons leading to accidents. Li, Ji, Yuan, and Han [8] indicated that good climate or
working environment is important for construction works’ safety. Irumba [6] pointed
out that in Kampala, Uganda, the congestion on the work site increases the accident rate.
2.2
Asymmetric Information Held by Diﬀerent Stakeholders on Sites
Asymmetric information and project risk
Many experts believe that the problem of asymmetric information causes safety risks
when conducting a project. Xiang, Zhou, Zhou, and Ye [12] indicated that the presence
of transaction costs leads to the existence of symmetric and asymmetric information.
Symmetric information may cause the risk of changes of interest rates, the ﬂuctuation
of exchange rates, and change politics. These risks can be predicted and are called
objective risks. Regarding asymmetric information, diﬀerent parties in a construction
project can apply it to satisfy their interest. It leads to behaviour risk being of each party
and this kind of project cannot be predicted. The objective risk and behaviour risk of
the participants make up the project risk (Fig. 1).
According to the principle-agent theory, asymmetric information could cause prob‐
lems of adverse selection and moral hazard [1]. Xiang, Huo, and Shen [12] believed that
asymmetric information could lead to adverse selection and moral hazard that are
harmful to a construction project. The problems will arise for diﬀerent stakeholders on
a construction site.

Fig. 1. Asymmetric information and project risk
Asymmetric information between diﬀerent stakeholders
In a construction project, the project owner and contractor hire their own project
managers. Thus, there are mainly four parties involved in a construction project. Asym‐
metric information will arise for these four parties and thus, there is a need to deal with
the communication problems between them [2]. In detail, the project owner will hire a
contractor at the beginning, and the contractor will perform for the project owner. As
diﬀerent parties have their own interests, the asymmetric information between the two
parties will lead to conﬂict in a construction project (Fig. 2) [3].
Fig. 2. Relationship between project owner (PO) and contractor (C) [3]
Furthermore, project owners and contractors hire their project managers to represent
them at work. Figure 3 shows the relationship between these four parties. The project
owner as well as contractor hire their own project managers who work for each of them.
The project owner’s project manager will supervise the project managers hired by the
contractor. The contractor’s project managers will communicate with the project

owner’s project manager. Besides, these four parties also have their own interests and
this will cause conﬂict in a construction project due to the asymmetric information held
by each party [3].

Research Method
Questionnaires and interviews were applied in this research to collect data. In the process
of interviewing, the author selected diﬀerent kinds of workers (based on their age, sex,
experience, etc.). The interview questions included the age of the interviewees, occu‐
pation of the interviewees, educational level, length of working, the size of working
company, etc. The detailed content is shown in Table 2.

Causes of Construction Accidents
This research approached diﬀerent employees from the construction industry in diﬀerent
occupations. In the interviews or survey, all the respondents had to rank the ﬁve most
important reasons that lead to construction accidents on building sites, bridges and
tunnels.
4.1
Buildings
In the construction industry, accidents occur when workers do not possess suﬃcient
knowledge about safety measures. Inadequate safety consciousness is one of the most
important causes that lead to construction accidents on sites. A surveyor from Swire
Properties Hong Kong contended that for the sake of convenience, many workers do not
take enough safety precautions. Some workers do not wear safety helmets. Objects often
fall on sites with high-rise buildings under construction. Without the helmets, workers
can easily be injured or even die.
According to the interviewees, bamboo scaﬀolding safety is always considered as a
major concern in the construction of buildings as the change of structure or shape raises
the danger level for workers on a site. In the eyes of an engineering assistant working
at SOCAM Development Limited, he ranked bamboo scaﬀolding as the second most
70
R.Y.M. Li et al.

important cause leading to accidents in high-rise buildings. In Hong Kong, in 2013, there
were 1,751 registered bamboo scaﬀolders, according to the Construction Workers
Registration Board, and roughly 200 scaﬀolding companies operate in the city (Ngo,
2013). The major problem of bamboo scaﬀolding is that it is not safe if the ties are not
tied securely enough. Also, it is dangerous once there are falling objects onto the scaf‐
folders because they can hardly avoid them.
Mr. Pang, a 23-year-old construction worker, ranked poor in-house keeping as the
fourth reason leading to construction accidents in buildings. He saw a worker drop into
a hole, which was supposed to be covered. After the investigation, the employer
company discovered that it was because another construction worker had uncovered it.
Another example provided by Mr. Pang was that the nails were put by a worker all
around the construction site, which might cause many accidents.
Some of construction accidents happen in the process of building construction.
Diﬀerent people have diﬀerent opinions towards the causes of construction accidents.
The buildings can be separated into high-rise buildings (taller than 100 m) and low-rise
buildings (equal to or less than 100 m).
4.2
Skyscrapers
Most interviewees thought that falling from a height (e.g. from scaﬀolding or a lifting
frame) is the ﬁrst most common high-risk building construction accident. The other
factors suggested to contribute to the risk of accidents included the high working envi‐
ronment, improper handling and carelessness, lack of training and awareness, the falling
of objects, and lack of experience.
The second most important cause of high-risk building construction accidents
suggested was the lack of supportive equipment. The other answers to this question
included bad working environment, improper handling and carelessness, falling from a
height (from the scaﬀolding or lifting frame), falling of objects, and the high working
environment.
Most interviewees believed that the third important reason was the improper use of
equipment, which included not wearing safety belts and helmets. The other answers to
this question included the bad working environment, machines, improper handling and
carelessness, electric shock or accident, and the process of transportation.
Low-rise buildings
Most of the interviewees thought that falling from a height (from the building, the
scaﬀolding or the lifting frame) was the ﬁrst most common low-rise building construc‐
tion accident. The other answers to this question included improper handling and care‐
lessness, the improper use of equipment, not following safety rules, falling of objects,
the lack of supportive equipment, and the process of transportation.
For the second most important reason of high-risk building construction accidents,
most interviewees realized that the falling of objects from height is the most leading
cause. The other answers to this question included falling from a height (from the
building, the scaﬀolding or the lifting frame), improper use of equipment, lack of
supportive equipment, high working environment, and bad working environment.

71

For the third question, the most common answer was also the falling of objects. The
other answers to this question included the bad working environment, improper use of
equipment, falling from a height (from the building, the scaﬀolding or the lifting frame),
electric shock or accidents, the lack of supervision, as well as machine malfunction.
4.3
Bridges
Apart from the buildings, construction accidents on bridges are common. Among all
causes of accidents on bridges, inadequate experience in the operation of the
machines is one of the major culprits triggering accidents. The use of large machi‐
nery is needed in the building of bridges, according to a 26-year-old construction
worker from Wing Fat Building Construction Ltd. For example, construction
workers may not check the weight of the load to be lifted so it may exceed the safe
working load. Besides, lifting gear such as hooks and shackles may not be checked
as to whether there is any wear and tear.
One of the causes of bridge construction accidents is too long working hours. The
labourers work for too many hours and it makes them tired. According to a Resident
Survey Oﬃcer at Aecom, there is a report that a worker worked for 24 h continuously
and died after falling into the sea. He held the belief that much engineering work is not
allocated enough time to complete resulting in long working hours. As a result, accidents
may happen easily if the workers are exhausted.
Adverse weather conditions can be another root sparking oﬀ construction accidents
on bridges. If a construction project is carried out near coastal areas, humidity mists up
the glass of transportation vehicles, like ferries and cars. With reference to a part-time
engineer assistant at Prudence Construction Co. Ltd., some ferries or ships may crash
into the bridges because they are not aware of their construction, especially when facing
low visibility which might be due to adverse weather conditions like heavy rainfall,
typhoons, tsunamis and so on.
The interviews show that most people believe that falling from a bridge is the ﬁrst
most common bridge construction accident. The other answers to this question included
accidents related to machines, improper handling and carelessness, car accidents, falling
of objects, and lack of experience.
Regarding the second most important reason for bridge construction accidents, most
interviewees realized that a bad working environment would cause accidents. The other
answers to this question included falling from a bridge, car accidents, the falling of
objects, being distracted, and the lack of supportive equipment.
Most interviewees thought that the third important reason was falling from a bridge
(despite we may argue that this not a reason; it is an accident. Many of the interviewees
point out the same thing). The other answers to this question included electric shocks
or accidents, a bad working environment, the process of transportation, unclear instruc‐
tions, bad weather, as well as ﬁre.
For the fourth question, the answer of falling from a bridge also became a major
cause of accident. The other answers included electric shocks or accidents, a bad working
environment, the lack of supportive equipment, the lack of training and awareness, and
accidents related to machines.

Last but not least, for the ﬁfth question, people thought that most accidents during
the process of bridge construction are caused by a bad working environment. The other
answers included the lack of supportive equipment, falling from the bridge, high working
environment, improper use of equipment, and the process of transportation.
4.4
Tunnels
There are several causes of accidents in tunnel construction. Kikkawa, Itoh, Hori, Toyo‐
sawa, and Orense [7] found that in Japan, one of the major causes of tunnel construction
accidents is rock falls. In addition to construction accidents on buildings and bridges,
asymmetric information is one of the leading factors behind construction accidents in
tunnels. Confined space could lead to accidents when it comes to the construction of
tunnels. Confined space is unfavourable as a working environment as various kinds of
injuries like loss of consciousness, asphyxiation or hyperthermia at work arise from gas,
fumes, vapour or the lack of oxygen. On the other hand, according to a skilled labourer at
Sun Wai Transportation Company, workers in a construction site for bridges might use
some flammable gas to weld metal. If workers store flammable gases carelessly, it could
lead to explosions and even contribute to the death of workers in the limited space.
The interview shows that most people think that inadequate ventilation is the ﬁrst
important reason behind tunnel construction accidents. The other answers to this ques‐
tion included the bad working environment (e.g. dark, narrow space, toxic gas), collapse,
car accidents, lack of supportive equipment, and explosions. The second often answered
important reason with regard to tunnel construction accidents was bad working envi‐
ronment. The other answers to this question included explosions, the lack of supportive
equipment, accidents related to machines, car accidents, the falling of objects, and inad‐
equate ventilation.
For the third most important reason, people also believed that the bad working
environment (dark, narrow space, toxic gas) would be the most important. The other
answers to this question included explosions, the improper use of equipment, lack
of supportive equipment, car accidents, lift faults, and electric shocks or accidents.
For the fourth question, the most common answer was also the bad working envi‐
ronment (dark, narrow space, toxic gas). The other answers included electric shocks
or accidents, inadequate ventilation, the lack of training and awareness, falling from
a height, and an untidy work site.
For the last question, poor working environment such as dark, narrow space, toxic
gas were the reasons mainly pointed by the respondents. The other common answers
included falling down stairwells, improper handling and carelessness, the process of
transportation, inadequate ventilation, as well as accidents related to machines.

Suggestions for Improving Construction Safety
According to the research ﬁndings, the improvement can be separated according to the
type of buildings.
For employees who work on skyscrapers, more supportive equipment (such as non-
slip shoes, safety belts, etc.) should be provided. Some of the old equipment should be
changed to new ones. Workers also need to learn the right way to use the equipment.
More training programmes should be provided for employees, especially for those who
work on high scaﬀolds; they need to be trained carefully to prevent them falling from a
height.
For those who work on the construction sites of low-rise buildings, supportive
equipment should be provided such as helmets, non-slip shoes, safety belts, etc. Before
starting work, machines and the environment should be checked regularly in order to
make sure the work site is in a safe condition.
For workers working on bridges, the equipment also should be well prepared such
as safety belts, safety nets, etc. Workers who lack experience should be trained and learn
more knowledge of operations in high working environments. In addition, there is a need
for safety supervision to make sure that workers are safe.
For workers who work in tunnels, equipment such as goggles, oxygen masks, non-
slip shoes, etc. should be well prepared. Before starting work, the machines and under‐
ground environment should be checked in order to make it safe.

Conclusion
This research tried to collect data from employees in the construction industry in Hong
Kong to obtain some suggestions to improve construction safety. From the survey, the
74
R.Y.M. Li et al.

data show that the major accidents in skyscraper construction are falling from a height
(from the scaﬀolding or lifting frame), lack of supportive equipment and the improper
use of the equipment; for low-rise buildings, the major accidents include falling from a
height and the falling of objects; the major bridge construction accidents include falling
from the bridge and the bad working environment; for tunnel construction, the major
causes are inadequate ventilation and the bad working environment (dark, narrow space,
toxic gas). According to the causes collected from the survey, there are several sugges‐
tions including preparing supportive new equipment (safety belts, non-slip shoes,
helmets, etc.) and replacing old ones, oﬀering more training programmes for employees
(especially those work on scaﬀolding), regularly checking the condition of the machines
and the working environment before beginning work, providing safety supervision
during the construction process, etc.

Limitation
Although the study has made a contribution, there are some limitations. As the ques‐
tionnaire and interview could not cover everyone working in the construction industry,
the study was based on the common situation and cannot include some extreme cases.

Abstract. This study is focused on an airplane crash case to analyze and identify
the accident contributing factors. The accident occurred on 27th of December
1991 in a few minutes after a Scandinavian Airlines System plane departed from
Stockholm on a route to Copenhagen, Denmark. It was found that the cause of
this accident is a combination of several factors. Errors can result from ambigu‐
ously written procedures, inadequate training, unexpected operational situations
or individual judgments. Situational awareness, environmental and crew coordi‐
nation factors, as well as shortcomings in pilot technical knowledge, skills and
experience, also can cause incidents. Other mistakes might be the result of
improper airspace design or crew coordination.

Introduction
On 27th of December 1991, an aircraft of model MD-81 operated by Scandinavian
Airlines System (SAS), ﬂight SK 751 departed from Arlanda International Airport in
Stockholm, Sweden, on a route to Copenhagen, Denmark. In a couple of minutes after
the departure both engines failed and the emergency landing had to be made on a ﬁeld.
Unfortunately, it did not succeed and the aircraft was broken in three pieces on impact
with the ground [1].
The aim of this study is to analyze the accident and identify the sequence of events
and conditions that contributed or caused the crash. This paper is prepared on the basis
of a study carried out at Chalmers University of Technology [2] and a literature survey
as well.

Description of the Accident
The day before accident SAS MD-81 plane arrived to Stockholm from Zurich in late
evening hours (around 22.00 h) and was parked at gate overnight with temperatures of
around +1 °C [1]. There were left approximately 2550 kg of fuel in each wing tank. The
next day aircraft was scheduled to leave Stockholm for Copenhagen at 08.30 h. In the
following day, early morning, the temperature had dropped to −0 °C [3]. During the
parking time clear ice had formed on the upper side of the wings.

Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing 604, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-60525-8_9

Checking routines by the ground crew member did not detect this phenomenon. The
aircraft was fueled with 1400 kg of fuel and de-icing procedure started immediately
before take-oﬀ. After de-icing the mechanic didn’t check whether there was any clear
ice on the upper side of the wings, since he had previously found none. The required
preparation was completed and aircraft took-oﬀ at 08.47 h from Runway 08 [3].
Already after 5 s captain could hear a humming noise. After 25 s (at 1124 ft height)
the right engine started to surge. Surging occurs when the compressor is no longer able
to compress the incoming air to the pressure obtaining in the engine’s combustion section
and this result in violent air shots in the opposite ﬂow direction [1].
The captain throttled back on the surging engine somewhat, but the surges continued
until the engine stopped delivering thrust after 76 s of ﬂight. When the ﬂight had lasted
65 s the left engine also started to surge, which the pilots did not notice before this engine
also lost thrust. This happened two seconds after the right engine had failed. When both
engines had failed the crew prepared for an emergency landing. When the aircraft was
entirely out of the cloud at a height of 300 to 250 m, a ﬁeld in the direction of ﬂight was
chosen for an emergency landing. During the approach the aircraft collided with trees
and a major part of the right wing was torn oﬀ. The tail of the aircraft struck the ground
ﬁrst and after the impact the aircraft slid along the ground for 110 m before stopping.
The fuselage was broken into three pieces and no ﬁre broke out. All 129 people on board
survived and most without physical injury. One passenger suﬀered a disabling back
injury [4]. Figure 1 shows the ﬂight pass of SAS ﬂight 751.

Identiﬁcation of Root Causes
Modern business aircraft are technological marvels. Utilizing the big screen multifunc‐
tion electronic displays that have replaced the dozens of traditional single purpose
mechanical instruments in the cockpit, “smart” fuel control systems that protect the
engines from exceeding speciﬁed temperature or power limits and advanced airfoil
designs, that achieve both high-speed cruise and slow-speed stability, commercial jets
and turboprops have attained an unprecedented level of eﬃciency and safety. Today,
mechanical problems account for only a fraction of aircraft-related safety incidents.
These developments are welcome news to all which travel by air; but to focus solely
on the machinery of ﬂight is to overlook the most critical safety component. The fact is
that even the most technologically sophisticated commercial jet is only as safe as the
pilots ﬂying it are. Analysts estimate that 70% to 90% of aviation accidents involve some
degree of pilot error.
An airplane is now part of a complex modern technology system, and there are three
aspects combined in safety matters within these systems as shown in Fig. 2. All
combined, had an important inﬂuence in the occurrence of the accident.
Fig. 2. Safety matter within complex technology system
The aircraft MD-81 crash can be called a system accident with a chain of diﬀerent
causes. Here we provide an identiﬁcation of initiating events and states as causal factors.
3.1
Environment
Weather. The weather conditions on December 27,1991 at the time of departure in
Arlanda airport was intermittent light snow, windy winter morning with the temperature
approximately –0 °C.
Aviation Accident Analysis: A Case Study
79

During the rescue operation it was overcast but with no precipitation, with temper‐
atures around 0 °C. The ground was frozen crust with a thin layer of snow.
Icy weather is a matter of life or death for the Federal Aviation Administration. Ten
airline accidents during takeoﬀs between 1978 and 1997 are attributed to ice forming
on jets. As a result, the FAA established tougher rules for aircraft de-icing on the ground.
Clear Ice. Clear ice that broke oﬀ from the wings and caused the damage to the engine
fan stages. It led to engines surges and destruction the engines.
It is well known that clear ice can form on the upper surfaces of wings under condi‐
tions of high atmospheric humidity or rain in combination with greatly chilled wings. It
is also well known that such ice is broken oﬀ through movements of the wings on liftoﬀ.
During the ﬂight from Zurich the fuel had become greatly chilled. On landing there
were 2 550 kg of fuel in each wing tank, which represents approx. 60% of the tank
volume. This volume of fuel was enough to chill the upper surfaces of the wings. The
meteorological conditions for the formation of clear ice where almost optimal. The ﬂight
technician who inspected the plane during the night noted that clear ice had already
formed on the wings. In addition, passengers saw during the de-icing that the indication
tufts were not moving and on lift oﬀ that ice was coming oﬀ the wings. It is clear that
“soft” objects being sucked into the engines initiated the engine damage.
3.2
People and Organization
(a) Reported Incidents
Several cases were reported related with the ice phenomenon on all DC-9 versions
and these events were reported to the authorities, manufacturers and operators.
For instance, after a number of cases where clear ice has been found remaining
on the wings following de-icing, Finnair summarized its experience in a report in
1985, in which the problem of undiscovered, unremoved clear ice was headlined
as “The most diﬃcult systematic threat to ﬂight safety today”.
For supervision, the Scandinavian countries have set up a special supervisory
body, to exercise technical and operational ﬂight supervision on its behalf.
In February 1990 it was noted that SAS had reported active work on “DC-9 Ice
Ingestion” and also was participating in international cooperation in the area. As a
result of this work SAS produced Swedish-language de-icing instructions for winter
operations 1991/92. This was judged by STK to be good basic material for solving
the clear ice problem. STK also made sure that the instructions were used in training.
Some recommendations were made before the accident concerning discovering
clear ice. The manufacturer recommended the installation of warning triangles with
indication tufts on critical wing areas.
(b) Inspection procedures
The problem of clear ice on this aircraft type had been known within SAS since
1985.
In various bulletins over the years the clear ice problem was described in detail
and mentioned that the problem was considered the greatest current threat to ﬂight
80
M. Shahriari and M.E. Aydin

safety. But the people responsible for the inspection of the aircraft did not follow
these recommendations.
The people responsible should check the aircraft for any ice or snow that may
aﬀect performance. A visual checks from a ladder or when standing on the ground
is not enough.
(c) Lack of information in training
In the MD-80 STUDY GUIDE that pilots use when training on the MD-80, clear
ice was not mentioned. The computerized self-studies referred to current regula‐
tions in FOM and AOM. These contained no information on the clear ice problem.
After the accident the ﬁrst oﬃcer stated that he had never realized the extent of the
clear ice problem during his training on the MD-80. In the AOM section that deals
with what is termed walk-around inspection there was no special instruction
regarding an ice check before ﬂying. Also if clear ice is formed, the aircraft shall
be inspected after de-icing to ensure that all-clear ice has been removed.
The normal checklist included no special item on ice and snow except for a
point regarding de-icing with the engines running. In the associated expanded
checklist it was stated for this control item only that the time required for the ﬂuid
to work should be veriﬁed against a table.
The technical division is responsible for de-icing being carried out correctly. In
the division the clear ice problem was well known and had been dealt with in
training, instructions and technical bulletins. Prior to the winter season, personnel
aﬀected at Arlanda were given training in de-icing.
Here, current instructions and general guidance concerning ice formation and
de-icing had been compiled for personnel aﬀected in Sweden. The de-icing instruc‐
tions, which did not have the status of registered technical documentation, were
used in training and were distributed to technicians and mechanics.
But even that the mechanic responsible for handing-over the aircraft was
appointed by the company in June 1990 and trained in de-icing that autumn, was
not able to report the clear ice formed at the accident.
(d) De-icing procedure
It is ultimately the captain’s responsibility to ensure that de-icing is done with
suﬃcient care. It is, however, the technical division that must answer for de-icing
being performed and checked. Besides the bulletins issued within the technical
division during the course of the year, training was organized before the start of the
winter season for all personnel concerned. Each mechanic was provided with a
checklist, which speciﬁed that he should check whether there was any clear ice by
feeling the wing upper surfaces with his hand.
There were no detailed instructions in defined nomenclature that described
how to check for the presence of clear ice, how the ice should be removed or how
the follow-up check and the report to the captain should be effected. In the
present case it should have been clear to the mechanic that he should check
whether there was any clear ice, since rime had been noted on the underside of
the wings in the tank area. He did perform this examination by climbing up on
a ladder and, with one knee up on the leading edge of the left wing near the
fuselage feel the upper side of the wing with one hand. He could not discover
Aviation Accident Analysis: A Case Study
81

any clear ice there and concluded wrongly that there was no clear ice further.
There was ice there, however, on an area which he, with this particular means
of checking, could not reach. To be able to carry out an effective examination
it would have been necessary for the mechanic to go out onto the wing, which
was slippery because of the precipitation.
Since he could not find any clear ice before the de-icing, the mechanic had
no reason, given the instructions in force, to check this again after de-icing had
been carried out.
3.3
Technology
(a) Knowledge of ATR within SAS
At the time of the accident there was no knowledge of ATR (Automatic Thrust
Restoration) within SAS. The pilots were therefore not trained on ATR and infor‐
mation about it was not included in their operational documentation. However, all
the necessary information was given in the aircraft manufacturer’s manuals avail‐
able within the company. Hence ATR was described in manuals which every oper‐
ator is obliged to know. Even though the system was originally developed for use
in special procedures not applied by SAS, a suﬃciently careful study of the manuals
should have led to SAS noting the system and training its pilots in its function. If
the pilots had been informed concerning ATR they would have had more chance
of noticing the changeovers. They would then have been better prepared to take
adequate action. It was a serious deﬁciency in ﬂight safety that the pilots lacked
knowledge of ATR and its function. It should be noted that in the event of loss of
thrust from one engine during the takeoﬀ phase, ATR must ensure that the ATS
(Auto Throttle System) immediately regulates thrust in the functioning engine. The
ATS always maneuvers the engine throttle levers simultaneously and equally. This
means that ATR initiates increase of an engine thrust and aﬀects the engine that
caused the system to be activated. Therefore there is strong requirement for instruc‐
tions on how pilots are to act in the event of engine surging during takeoﬀ.
(b) The combustion system failure
Nothing has emerged to indicate that the aircraft’s engines before the rotation had
any technical fault that aﬀected the development of engine surging. However, a
manufacturing fault in a weld seam in the aircraft’s main fuel duct to the left engine
contributed to a fuel leak occurring in connection with the engine failure. The course
of the failure was very similar in both engines. Mentioned before sequence of events
will be now stated with more details:
Modern turbofan engines are sensitive to damage to fan blades and outer fan
blade seals. Fan blade damage located on the blades outer tips is particularly critical.
Such damage can at high engine power cause local fan tip stall. The fan tip stalls
can increase and form “rotating cells” in the fan stage which called as continually
rotating fan tip stalls.
The aerodynamic disturbances in the fan stage propagated themselves to the
compressors and caused engine surging. As it was indicated before activated ATS
through the eﬀect of ATR caused an increase in throttle that contributed to the fact
82
M. Shahriari and M.E. Aydin

that the surging continued and intensiﬁed until the engine ﬁnally broke up. The risk
of engine surging as a consequence of damage in the fan stages depends on the
extent and character of the damage.
The surges subjected the engines to aerodynamic and mechanical stresses that
became greater with the increasing engine power. The engine damage indicates that
the stage 1 stators were ﬁnally broken up by these stresses and the engine failed.
The increase in engine power also caused the left engine to surge and fail in the
same manner. The impact damage found on the fan blade trailing edges was caused
largely by broken-oﬀ stator pieces. The pieces then accompanied the airﬂow into
the front compressors, causing extensive damage to their front stages. Blades and
guide vanes in the rear parts of the compressors were damaged by pieces struck
loose further forward in the engines.
When the engine compressors failed there was high air pressure and thereby a
copious supply of oxygen. Local high temperatures were generated through friction
between rotating, static and broken-oﬀ metal pieces. Titanium alloy pieces were
thus ignited. Through a combination of high temperatures and mechanical load,
holes were made in the engines’ rear compressor cases, which serve, as pressure
vessels for the rear compressors. The pressure and temperature thereby decreased
rapidly, causing the titanium ﬁre to stop spontaneously after the brief break-up
phase.
Thanks to the ﬁre alarm system the ﬁrst oﬃcer has recognized the risk and
initiated the engine ﬁre extinguishing system.
As the further consequence of the engine failure was electrical power failure
that inactivated captain’s Electronic Flight Instrument System presentation that
caused more diﬃcult to steer the aircraft in emergency landing.
3.4
Organizational
Negligent Attitude by SAS. The risk of ingestion of clear ice by the engines of the
aircraft type has been known for many years. As early as 1985 a DC-9-51 suﬀered serious
engine damage for this reason. On the MD-80 series, the risk is greater due to the
conﬁguration of the wing tanks and the larger engine air intake area. The manufacturer
has therefore over the years taken a number of steps to inform operators of the problem
and has distributed numerous service bulletins intended to reduce the risks.
The problem has thus long been known within SAS. In 1987 the aircraft were
equipped with warning triangles with indication tufts to facilitate the discovery of clear
ice. It was stated that it is the captain’s responsibility to check the presence of snow and
ice which might aﬀect the aircraft’s performance.
In the training of MD-80 pilots the clear ice problem has not been specially dealt
with; nor were there any special written instructions for the pilots’ action if there was a
risk of clear ice. If the pilots had more knowledge and unambiguous instructions, they
would probably have been more alert to the risk of clear ice formation.
Technical personnel were thus familiar with the clear-ice problem through training
and information. In the Board’s view, however, the clear-ice problem as dealt with in
LMH, which is the formal governing document for direct work, had an obscure position
Aviation Accident Analysis: A Case Study
83

and lacked detailed instructions on how the check for clear ice should be carried out;
nor was there any follow-up on how the check should be performed in daily practice.
There was no routine for reporting on observations regarding clear ice. Though, the
technician who inspected the aircraft during the night noted the presence of clear ice,
but there was no instructions obliging him to report this to the mechanic who was to
carry out the departure check next morning.
Furthermore, the technical personnel had no access to suitable aids for checking
eﬀectively. To reach the critical area on the upper side of the wing without risking an
accident, either special tools or specially built ladders would have been required. It must
be considered remarkable that the numerous diﬀerent warning signals on the risks asso‐
ciated with clear ice that have reached SAS over the years have not led to eﬀective action
being taken to ensure that aircraft did not take oﬀ with clear ice on their wings.
It is obvious that SAS self-monitoring has been deﬁcient regarding the handling of
the clear-ice problem. It also emerges that the Scandinavian Civil Aviation Supervisory
Agency was not aware of the deﬁcient quality assurance. The Board points out that the
idea of self-monitoring presupposes that the supervisory authority ensures that the
company possesses a well functioning system of quality assurance.

Conclusion
The cause of this accident is the combination of several factors, ambiguously written
procedures, inadequate training, unexpected operational situations or individual judg‐
ments. Situational awareness, environmental and crew coordination factors, as well as
shortcomings in pilot technical knowledge, skills and experience, also can cause acci‐
dents. Other mistakes might be the result of improper airspace design or crew coordi‐
nation.
As an initial event, the clear ice formed on the upper surface of the wings was not
detected and de-iced well. The company instruction, procedures and even the equipment
were not suﬃcient to remove the clear ice from the wing surface. Hence during the take-
oﬀ the clear ice was broken oﬀ the wings and ingested by the engines and caused damage
the engine fan stages, which led to engine surges and failure. The pilot had no suﬃcient
knowledge and training to identify the problem and taking the necessary action. Further‐
more, there was no knowledge for applying Automatic Thrust Restoration system (ATR)
within the company (SAS). Therefore it was activated and increased the engine power
without the pilot knowledge. Another contributing cause was poor emergency landing
responses in terms of speed and ﬂap position for approach and landing.
Finally, it may be concluded that unsafe pre-conditions which had been created by
SAS organization in terms of training, instruction, operational procedures etc. were
blamed for pilot and technicians errors and mistakes which led to the crash.

Abstract. The study reported in this paper analyzed the determinants of
occupational accidents from a social and a working conditions combined per-
spective, considering the level of analysis of the European nation. Fatal and
non-fatal work accidents in 2014, collected and provided by Eurostat, are cor-
related with country by country results of the 7th European Social Survey
(ESS) (2014 data). This informs on work accident determinants of the European
Social Dimensions reported on the ESS. Moreover, considering data from the
6th European Working Conditions Survey (2015 data), working conditions, on a
country by country basis as well, are further considered and analyzed from the
perspective of fatal and non-fatal accidents and from the perspective of social
dimensions. This multiple pronged study of association unveils interesting
associations between fatal and non-fatal work accidents and working conditions,
as well as between fatal and non-fatal work accidents and social dimensions, and
also, between social dimensions and working conditions, taking the European
country as a unit of analysis. The ﬁndings shed light on the interconnectedness
of the distinct domains under study, as well as informing policy development
towards creating tailor made approaches suiting each particular country reality
within the countries encompassed in the analysis.

Introduction
Humanitarian and economic considerations alike prompt the need to improve working
conditions, which is a collective concern. A safe and healthy working environment is
an essential element of the quality of work. A territory populated by more than ﬁve
hundred million people, the European continent boasts high levels of diversity, which
has been studied and analyzed in several dimensions, cross-sectionally and longitu-
dinally. European Union institutions have been carrying out themselves, and, or,
sponsoring academic institutions to do the analysis and monitoring of a great set of
indicators across the continent, including social dimensions, working conditions and
fatal and non-fatal work injuries.

In an effort to continuously reduce work accidents, understanding their social and
working conditions determinants may shed light on the need for particular policy
measures aiming at improving social dimensions and working conditions across the
continent. The study reported in this paper aims providing a contribution to the
understanding of the association of social factors and working conditions with fatal and
non-fatal accidents across Europe. In particular, the study’s objective is to analyze the
determinants of fatal and non-fatal accidents at work from a social and working con-
ditions combined perspective, considering the level of analysis of the nation. In this
paper, the most recent EUROSTAT statistics of EU fatal and non-fatal accidents at
work are ﬁrst presented and then correlated (with the assistance of IBM SPSSS v.23)
with selected country by country results of the 7th European Social Survey (2014 data)
[1]. This informs on social determinants (selected European Social Dimensions
reported on the 2014 ESS - Round 7) of fatal and non-fatal accidents at work. Addi-
tionally, considering data from the 6th European Working Conditions Survey (2015
data) [2], selected aspects of working conditions, on a country by country basis as well,
are further considered and analyzed from the perspective of social dimensions and from
the perspective of accidents at work, taking the European country as a unit of analysis.
The ﬁndings shed light on the interconnectedness of the distinct domains under study,
as well as informing policy development towards creating tailor made approaches
suiting each particular country reality within the sample of countries encompassed in
the analysis.

Fatal and Non-fatal Accidents at Work (2014 Data)
Non-fatal and fatal accidents at work in the European Union (EU) are collected within
the framework of the European statistics on accidents at work (ESAW) administrative
data collection. In ESAW methodology an accident at work is deﬁned as a discrete
occurrence during the course of work which leads to physical or mental harm. Fatal
accidents at work are those that lead to the death of the victim within one year.
Non-fatal accidents at work collected within ESAW are those that imply at least four
full calendar days of absence from work (they are sometimes also called ‘serious
accidents at work’). Non-fatal accidents at work often involve considerable harm for
the workers concerned and their families and they have the potential to force people,
for example, to live with a permanent disability, to leave the labor market, or to change
job; indeed, they result in a considerable number of days of work being lost [3].
The most recent statistics of EU fatal and non-fatal accidents at work available from
EUROSTAT are shown on Table 1. They are depicted both in absolute terms and as
per capita values, considering the total population of the country (as of January 1st
2015, according to EUROSTAT [4]).

Selected Dimensions of the European Social Survey
(2014 Data)
The European Social Survey (ESS) [1] is an academically driven cross-national survey
that has been conducted across Europe since its establishment in 2001. Every two
years, face-to-face interviews are conducted with newly selected, cross-sectional
samples. The survey measures the attitudes, beliefs and behavior patterns of diverse
populations in more than thirty nations.
For the purpose of the analysis reported on this paper, a selection was made of 16
indicators extracted from the ESS round 7 2014 data, using as criteria to extract no
more than two questions from each of the core section themes (media and social trust,
politics, subjective well-being, gender and household, socio demographics and human
values), with the exception of human values, where more variables were extracted, in
order to match them with the cultural dimensions presented in Sect. 2. Table 2 depicts
the result of the selection. The selection was subjectively carried out by the researcher,
based on the perception of the most impactful themes covered in the ESS7 regarding
working conditions.
Selected average scores per country were obtained from the dataset (ESS round 7)
and are shown in Tables 3 and 4. In this process, the response scale items were
considered in a question by question approach (answer ranges shown to survey
respondents are given in the Tables captions).

Selection of Dimensions from the European Working
Conditions Survey (2015 Data)
Since its launch in 1990, the European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) has
provided an overview of working conditions in Europe [6]. Themes covered today
include employment status, working time duration and organization, work organiza-
tion, learning and training, physical and psychosocial risk factors, health and safety,
work-life balance, worker participation, earnings and ﬁnancial security, as well as work
and health. For the purpose of the analysis reported on this paper, a selection was made
of indicators extracted from the 6th EWCS 2015 data [2]. Tables 5 and 6 depict the

Results of Analysis of Association
Association between the fatal and non-fatal accidents at work statistics (in per capita
formulation) presented in Sect. 2, and the selected social dimensions presented in
Sect. 3 was made based on data from 20 countries that were matched across the two
datasets. Table 9 depicts the pairs of variables where Pearson correlation factors above
0.45 were found. Both dimensions of accidents at work statistics are equally salient in
this analysis. The social dimensions that are more salient in this analysis are those of
satisfaction with life as a whole, frequency of social meetings and importance given to
equally of treatment and opportunities as well as of following rules.

Association between the fatal and non-fatal accidents at work statistics (in per
capita formulation) presented in Sect. 2, and the selected working conditions dimen-
sions presented in Sect. 4 was made based on data from 20 countries that were matched
across the two datasets. Table 10 depicts the pairs of variables where Pearson corre-
lation factors above 0.45 were found. Both per capita dimensions of accidents at work
statistics are equally salient in this analysis. The physical working dimensions that is
most salient in this analysis of association concerns vibrations from hand tools and
machinery. The psychosocial working dimensions that display a great number of
associations with the accidents at work statistics are those concerned with the average
per country score of responses given to ‘getting on better with own children because of
having a job’. A third set of associations concerns the correlation between selected
social and working conditions dimensions (Table 11). Most salient social dimensions
in the analysis are peoples’ perceived helpfulness, subjective general health, peoples’
perceived trustworthiness, the trustworthiness of the legal system and the level of
satisfaction with life as a whole. In what concerns physical working conditions, the
variables most involved in the strong correlations are experiencing tiring or painful
positions and working with electronic devices. Salient psychosocial factors are
recognition for work, organization motivated performance, job insecurity and prospects
of ﬁnding a new job if needed.

Linear regression modelling (forward method) of fatal work accidents per capita
was pursued, taking as independent variables all other variables present in this study.
This modelling effort resulted in a determination coefﬁcient of 0.308, with a single
standardized coefﬁcient of satisfaction with life as a whole at −0.555, with a signiﬁ-
cance level of 0.011. Adding the national dimensions of culture [7–14] to the inde-
pendent variable pool in the regression of fatal accidents at work, yields a determination
coefﬁcient of 0.631, for the cultural dimension of individuality at −0.653 standardized
coefﬁcient (p < 0.001) and the importance of equal treatment and opportunities at
0.521 standardized coefﬁcient (p = 0.003). Linear regression modelling (forward
method) of non-fatal work accidents per capita ensued, taking as independent variables
all remaining variables included in the study, except for fatal accidents at work. This
modelling effort led to a very high determination coefﬁcient of 0.901, based on a six
independent variables model (Table 12). The regression model includes four social
variables (education level, gender imbalance, importance given to rules and frequency
of socializing) and two occupational exposures (lifting or moving people and handling
angry clients). When national dimensions of culture [7–14] are added to the pool of
independent variables for linear regression, the determination coefﬁcient increases
slightly to 0.937 with four social variables (gender imbalance, importance given to
rules and frequency of socializing), tow occupational exposures (lifting or moving
people and being in emotionally disturbing situations) and one cultural dimension (long
term orientation versus short term orientation). The standardized coefﬁcients for these
variables and the signiﬁcance levels are shown in Table 13.

Discussion
The results of association suggest that countries where people report a lower average
degree of satisfaction with life as a whole (e.g. Portugal, Lithuania, Hungary) are bound
to incur higher number of per capita fatal accidents at work. The moderate correlation
found between the latter and the average score given by people to the importance of
equal treatment and equal opportunities, suggests that countries where people on
average give more relative importance to this issue (e.g. Spain, Slovenia) show a
moderate tendency to display higher numbers of per capita fatal accidents at work than
countries where this issue is given lower importance (e.g. Czech Republic, Lithuania).
However, other factors seem to be at play, including the aforementioned degree of
satisfaction with life as a whole and the working conditions dimensions discussed in
the following paragraph.
Analysis of correlation between fatal accidents at work and physical job exposures
yielded a moderate correlation for vibrations from hand tools and machinery, indicating
that countries where on average more people are subjected to this physical exposure at
work (e.g. Poland, Hungary, Estonia) show a moderate tendency to suffer a relatively
higher rate of fatal accidents per capita. The single psychosocial factor that correlated
with accidents at work was ‘getting on better with own children because of having a
job’ which associated strongly with non-fatal work accidents. Countries where people
on average show higher levels of agreement with the aforementioned EWCS survey
item (e.g. Slovenia, Ireland, Finland, Norway) tend to have relatively lower per capita
rates of non-fatal accidents at work. Associations of physical exposures with
self-perceived health were negative for vibrations, breathing in some and fumes,
experiencing tiring or painful positions and performing repetitive hand or arm move-
ments. Job security correlated very notably with trust in the legal system and recog-
nition for work. The greatest absolute value of correlation found in the study was 0.879
between job insecurity and trust in the legal system.
Regression results for fatal accidents at work point to satisfaction with life as a
whole as the single predictor, when encompassing in the model the social and working
conditions variables selected for this study. However, when adding cultural factors to
the two aforementioned domains, the results suggest that countries with lower indi-
viduality and higher collective national culture (e.g. Slovenia, Portugal) and where at
the same time, on average, citizens place relatively higher important on equal treatment
and opportunities (e.g. Slovenia) are bound to incur in relatively higher fatal work
accident rates per capita. Linear regression of non-fatal work accidents shows a very
high determination coefﬁcient on two six variable models. There are four variables
common to both models, which are gender imbalance (the more females the less
accidents), lifting or moving people (more lifting yields more accidents), importance
given to rules (the more disregard for rules the more accidents) and meeting for
socializing (the more frequent social gatherings the more accidents at work).
There are limitations in this study. First and foremost, given the breadth of the ESS
and ECWS surveys, a selection of variables was made, which carries a level of sub-
jectivity. Moreover, the size of the level of analysis in this study (country level)
precludes ﬁne grained differences which are inherently present in any big population

group, such as a nation. This notwithstanding strong correlations were found between
all the three datasets associated in this study. Moreover, the European countries
included in each of the three datasets considered was not the same; the intersection of
the three datasets yielded a sample of twenty European countries. Hence, the scope of
analysis while continent wide is not completely encompassing.

Conclusion
The current study was aimed at providing a contribution to the understanding of the
association of social factors and working conditions with fatal and non-fatal accidents
at work across Europe. The study shows a moderate strength and quantity of associ-
ations of social and working conditions variables to accidents at work.
The correlation analysis between social and occupational dimensions showed the
salience of peoples’ perceived helpfulness, subjective general health, peoples’ per-
ceived trustworthiness, the trustworthiness of the legal system, the level of satisfaction
with life as a whole, experiencing tiring or painful positions, working with electronic
devices, recognition for work, organization motivated performance, job insecurity and
prospects of ﬁnding a new job if needed. The social dimensions that are most note-
worthy as determinants of working conditions are peoples’ perceived helpfulness,
subjective general health, peoples’ perceived trustworthiness, the trustworthiness of the
legal system, the level of satisfaction with life as a whole. In most countries encom-
passed in this study, fatal accidents at work are two to three orders of magnitude below
non-fatal accidents of work; in many countries there is one fatal work accident for
roughly every thousand non-fatal work accidents. Hence, the meager results of asso-
ciation and regression obtained for the fatal work accidents are understandable given
that this is in most countries a “residual” phenomenon, where much progress has been
made over the last decades. The most consistent determinants of fatal accidents found
through the multiple approaches of association deployed was satisfaction with life as a
whole. Determinants of non-fatal accidents consistently found through multiple
approaches of association were relatively lower proportion of females in the population,
higher incidence of lifting, propensity to disregard rules and a higher frequency of
social gatherings.
Future research should focus on different levels of analysis, and exploring further
implications for safety policy of the ﬁndings of the current study. Moreover, given the
existence of longitudinal data for accident data and for the working conditions and
social surveys, it is feasible to explore the evolution of the associations, and as such
ascertain their persistence over time, and provide a contribution to build more gener-
alized models of the phenomena under study.

Abstract. Since the introduction of the concept of culture in the safety domain,
much eﬀort has been put into its assessment. Such assessments are typically
carried out to come to a diagnosis and, possibly, a culture improvement. While
the relationship between culture and behavior remains ambiguous and the odds
of steering a culture into a desirable direction are equally uncertain, the develop‐
ment process of culture might oﬀer more solace. Skipping the assessment alto‐
gether, the process oﬀers both cultural insight and opportunities to inﬂuence the
culture more towards a culture for safety. To establish such a culture, it is impor‐
tant that people can voice their concerns and share information openly.

Introduction
If I am not mistaken, the term ‘safety culture’ was coined right after the nuclear disaster
in Chernobyl. Overlooking all wrongs and trespasses surrounding the nuclear reactor in
Ukraine, the investigating committee’s only resort seemed to be to put the label ‘culture’
on the disaster’s overall cause. Safety culture, that is. The rest is history. Safety culture
was eventually embraced by the safety community at large and became a main entry in
the safety professional’s handbook. As I have stated elsewhere, although the marriage
of safety with culture has been proliﬁc, it is unfortunate nevertheless [1]. While safety
deﬁnitely has a normative ﬂavor attached to it, culture has not. That is, something (an
activity, an installation) can be safe or unsafe, good or bad, but cultures never are; they
are just, well, cultures.
This popularity of safety culture has led to an avalanche of papers on the topic, of
what it is and what it is not, on how to assess it and how to order cultures on a ladder
into safety heaven, mimicking a similar boom in the 80s on the topic of organizational
culture. Understandably, much eﬀort has been put into the assessment or measurement
of safety culture, all under the heading of “You cannot manage what you can’t measure”.
But is this really necessary? I truly wonder. Is culture really manageable, or measurable,
for that matter? I will explore these two questions in this paper.
Firstly, I will discuss the relation between culture and behavior; this is not an undis‐
puted fact but instead an empirical question. This relationship might be present but is
ambiguous. Then I will turn to the assessment of culture. Assessing culture is not without

problems and while the relationship with behavior is indeﬁnite, the outcome of the
assessment is questionable too. Does this render the concept of safety culture useless?
I do not think so and I will explain why in the next section. The development of culture
is a continuous process and taking this as a starting point, opportunities to inﬂuence it
open up.

Culture and Behavior
The construct of culture is familiar terrain for sociologists and anthropologists, but for
safety professionals it is still quite new and so they are not yet fully comfortable with
it. This is because culture is invisible, it only shows through something else, like, for
instance, behavior. The main assumption is, that the (visible) behavior is driven by an
(invisible) force. This invisible force is culture. The comparison of culture with a natural
force is not entirely unreasonable [2]; natural forces are equally invisible but evidently
exert their inﬂuence. (Safety professionals know all about this, as many accidents are
caused by the force of gravity.) However, whether some behavior is caused by an under‐
lying culture cannot be stated beforehand, it is an empirical question. I will explain why,
using Figs. 1 and 2.

In Fig. 1, the ambiguous relationship between culture and behavior and, vice versa,
behavior and culture is depicted. Neither one directly inﬂuences the other nor is inﬂu‐
enced directly by the other. One could also state that neither one is a necessary condition
for the other but, possibly, a suﬃcient one. Such vagueness is a nightmare for scientists
102
F.W. Guldenmund

but a real treasure-trove for consultants. What is more, their safety culture assessments
proﬁt from this vagueness, as they cannot seem to go wrong. Unfortunately, this also
reﬂects negatively on the culture concept itself, as it has become a true ‘God-of-the
gaps’, to explain missing links in our understanding of safe and unsafe behavior [1].
Nevertheless, we are not at a complete loss when considering the relationship between
culture and behavior. Let us therefore turn to Fig. 2.
Culture exerts its inﬂuence through a person’s personal values and attitudes, which
translate themselves into an intention or mindset that may, or may not, materialize into
behavior that is in harmony with the underlying culture. Throughout this chain, the
(possible) inﬂuence of culture can diminish gradually. That is, a person can endorse a
cultural value to a greater or lesser extent and also situational contexts may elicit or
enforce counter-cultural behaviors. This is basically the culture–behavior chain.
Going backwards through this chain, when observing a person’s behavior, an inﬂu‐
ence of culture can be put forward. The ﬁrst question that should be asked, is, however,
‘Does this person always behave like this?’. If not, the behavior might be accidental, or
elicited or enforced by the situation this person ﬁnds himself (or herself) in. If the answer
is aﬃrmative, the follow-up question should be, ‘Does this person behave like this in
other situations?’. When this answer is negative, the behavior is probably determined
by the situation and cultural causes can be dropped. However, when the answer is posi‐
tive, the behavior is more probably related to the person, but other persons might behave
in the same way. Therefore, a third question should be posed, ‘Do others behave in a
similar way?’. If yes, the cause of the behavior might be cultural and a further investi‐
gation into an actual cultural cause is warranted. Overall, looking at behavior and
assuming cultural causes is tricky.
The backwards reasoning above is based on third-person (outsider) observations
only. When involving people’s own perceptions of their behavior and/or of an under‐
lying culture, relationships become even more opaque. Schein’s culture model can
explain this quite well. According to Schein, an (organizational) culture consists of
a core, surrounded by two layers. The core is the essence of the culture and mostly
invisible to outsiders. Insiders experience the core as self-evident and self-explana‐
tory, they cannot see things otherwise. When asked about their culture, they will
espouse the things they think they need to say or are supposed to say: strategies,
intentions, ambitions, and so on. This is also what outsiders first hear about a
culture. Furthermore, what outsiders actually experience is even more remote from
the core, the outer layer. Schein calls these experiences artifacts, the culture’s
observables [3]. The point is, what can be seen or heard about a culture, does not
have to be in line with the culture’s core. Moreover, insider’s opinions about their
culture are equally unreliable and need to be processed further (Schein talks about
deciphering) to expose actual underlying cultural assumptions.
Back in the 80s, culture had already been imported into management science. At the
time, (management) researchers wondered why some companies were more successful
than others. A possible explanation was found in the company culture, also called
organizational culture. Not only that, national culture was called into play, too. That is,
both national culture and organizational could contribute to a company’s success, or so
the reasoning went. During that time, Hofstede’s research on national cultures became

103

popular also [4, 5]. Not without reason, as Hofstede’s 4D-model is highly attractive
because of its sheer simplicity. According to Hofstede, countries can be projected into
this 4D-space based on their scores on each of the model’s four dimensions: power
distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism (or collectivism) and masculinity (or
femininity). That is, nations can be ordered based on the assumed power relations
between people in the country, their overall preference for rules and structure, the
importance of the (in) group versus the individual and the extent to which male (asser‐
tiveness, competitiveness) or female (mutual care, consensus) attributes are stressed in
daily life.
While Hofstede’s model was taken onboard by many management scientists and also
managers, anthropologists did not care for it [6, 7]. For one thing, many do not really
endorse ‘national cultures’, for another, they rather submerge themselves into a culture
than send out questionnaires. This distinction between epistemologies is important and
has been the cause of heated debates in the 80s and beyond. The distinction basically
boils down to the research approach; whether culture is studied top-down (etic) or
theory-driven, or bottom-up (emic) or data-driven.
3
Assessing Culture: Emic and Etic Approaches
Emic or data-driven research (emic) does not commence with a particular notion of how
culture(s) are organized or ‘dimensionized’. Put in other words, there is no standardized
instrument to ‘measure’ culture with. A researcher studies a culture on its own merits,
on its own achievements, on its own givens. (S)he starts from ‘scratch’ and works her
(or his) way upwards towards a theory of the culture under study. The data collected are
generally qualitative and the result is a rich description of a culture.
In contrast, an etic approach works from theory; a theory that describes what matters
in (all) cultures and which provides a standardized instrument with which to ‘measure’
these generic aspects in a particular culture. Such measurements are typically obtained
using a standard measurement scale, like a ﬁve- or seven-point Likert-scale; the latter
scale measures endorsement on an x-point scale. This also means the data are quantita‐
tive. Hofstede’s 4D-model is a typical example of an etic approach.
It is hard to reconcile both approaches. Moreover, both approaches seem to have
merit, as all cultures will be somehow unique, although they will have coped with similar
or comparable issues. In an etic approach, uniqueness will be reﬂected in unique scores
on common dimensions, whereas in an emic approach, no common dimensions exist
initially, although they might surface in the end.
Safety culture assessments need to apply an etic approach eventually, as only this
approach provides a common framework to measure and compare (safety) cultures with.
This means that safety cultures will not be judged on their own merits. They are either
104
F.W. Guldenmund

good, or not so good, or something in between. And safety heaven is the ultimate goal,
whatever that may be.1
In much culture research the emphasis is on data collection, a description of the
culture, and a diagnosis, i.e., pointing out relatively (strong and) weak points. Another
way of making a culture assessment is comparing the description of a culture with a
particular (safety) cultural norm; for instance, the safety culture requirements for organ‐
izations handling nuclear sources provided by the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) [9] or the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO) [10]. Such requirements
are often based on expert opinions about what is good or bad for nuclear safety. Please
note the diﬀerent types of knowledge required for such an enterprise, descriptive
(assessment) and prescriptive (guidance).
Overall, there are ﬁve types of knowledge, which can be ordered in terms of relative
complexity [11]. These types are:
1. Descriptive knowledge (knowledge describing a phenomenon);
2. Explanatory knowledge (kn. that describes causes and consequences);
3. Predictive knowledge (kn. making predictions possible);
4. Evaluative knowledge (kn. providing a basis for judgements, decisions);
5. Prescriptive knowledge (kn. to support well-founded advice or guidance).
Importantly, knowledge higher up in the hierarchy requires (established, well-founded)
knowledge from a lower level. However, with regard to culture, much of what we know
is still at the descriptive level. There is very little established knowledge beyond explan‐
atory knowledge and even that is based mostly on argumentation, not on empirical
research. Put in other words, there is very little evidence, if any, that the safety culture
that is aimed for in some approaches, is as safe as it is assumed to be.
Due to the very nature of the concept, culture remains a highly descriptive phenom‐
enon that has to be assessed indirectly through observations, statements, attitudes and
perceptions. Instead of focusing on the assessment, the development of culture provides
another handle to work with safety culture. This development is explored in the next
section.
4
The Development of Culture
Culture is not a static notion, it actually develops continuously. Of course, the speed
of this development is different at different levels of culture. National cultures (do
they actually exist?) develop more slowly than organizational cultures, or cultures
of smaller groups. Instead of focusing on the assessment of culture, organizations are
better advised to ‘work’ with their culture. Please note the use of the verb ‘work’;
I specifically use the verb to ‘work’, not to ‘change’. Changing comes close to
‘manipulating’, which is perhaps what managers want, but which is also unethical.
1 In some approaches, like, for instance, Hearts & Minds (see: http://heartsandminds.ener‐
gyinst.org/), high-reliable organizing (HRO) is considered to be the ultimate goal. HRO has
been proposed as a solution against ‘normal accidents’; major accidents that are bound to
happen in tightly-coupled, hazardous systems [8].

The model of the development of culture will explain way; the model can be
described using five distinct steps (Fig. 3) [12]:
1. Understanding
2. Exchanging
3. Formalizing
4. Transmitting
5. Reinforcing
Fig. 3. The development of (safety) culture
The world does not speak for itself. Although this statement does not seem obvious,
it is important to understand. The reason why the world usually does make sense is in
part due to the fact that groups of people share some common understandings about the
world that surrounds them. Part of this shared understanding is what we call culture [13].
Take, for example, a plastic bottle of water.2 We all know what it is, what might be in
it and what should be done with it. But how do we know this? Because somebody once
told us, or showed us. However, someone who has never seen a plastic bottle, might not
have a clue what is in it, or what to do with it.
Furthermore, having a similar understanding of a plastic bottle does not mean we
attach a similar meaning to it. For example, a chemist sees a product of various chemical
reactions and admires its strength or transparency. An activist, on the other hand, sees
a reprehensible throw-away object of our consumer society and thinks with horror about
the huge amount of plastic ﬂoating somewhere on the Paciﬁc. And so on. The point is,
that objects or actions or any other observable do not speak for themselves, do not have
meaning or signiﬁcance of their own. We continuously provide meaning to the
surrounding world and many of these meanings are established in a culture. Step 1 in
Fig. 3 above, is exactly about this, (trying to) understand the surrounding world by giving
meaning to it. This is an individual activity that people carry out all the time.
However, people live and work together. Because of this, common meanings need
to be established, otherwise confusion would be abounding. Such common meanings
are established through human exchanges and interactions (Step 2). These interactions
lead to agreements, disagreements, conﬂicts, and so on. Agreements will deﬁne of what
is called the ‘shared understanding’, the common ground, the culture. Disagreements

will delineate the borders of the culture. Conﬂicts might lead to separation and sub-
cultures. Or the conﬂict continues within the culture as an agreement, “Let’s agree to
disagree”, or a taboo that is left alone.
The agreement that is established eventually (or not) in this step has to be based on
a full exchange, that is, it has to be truly open and evenly balanced between the parties
engaging in the exchange. If not, the agreement is either not based on all information
available (people are holding information back) or it is enforced (one party is actually
imposing her or his view onto the other). Ideally, this exchange is based on ‘Humble
inquiry’, or so Schein argues. Humble inquiry is an attitude practiced in communication
that is aimed at a genuine interest in the other party’s viewpoint [14].
People might recognize Step 1, but do not experience the exchange of Step 2. Obvi‐
ously, within an existing culture there are already many agreements established, other‐
wise it would not be a culture. An exchange about meanings usually is not necessary,
or even desirable. Instead, by interpreting an object or action as intended within the
culture, people actually reinforce its intended (cultural) meaning. That is, they skip Steps
2 through 4 in Fig. 3 above, and immediately arrive at Step 5, Reinforcing. Step 2 might
become active when no common meaning has been established yet, which might show
in confusion, in a dilemma or a in conﬂict.
After a common agreement has been reached, one typically observes that such
agreement continues as a sort of rule or standard. This rule might be written up as a law
or procedure, but it can also live on as an ‘unwritten’ rule. Put in other words, one could
say that the agreement has been formalized (Step 3). Formalization can become even
more formal, which implies that the rule or standard has been institutionalized. This
means that the rule functions as a formal standard or norm for the people in the culture.
People are supposed to comply with it.
The advantage of written rules and standards is that they can be transmitted to others,
to newcomers, for instance. This is the formal way. Within culture, part of the learning
of the rules takes place informally. Through so-called socialization processes,
newcomers are ‘enculturated’ (Step 4).
As already stated above, much of our actions within a culture are aimed at rein‐
forcement (Step 5) rather than going through the more tedious process of negotiation of
meanings and understandings. Furthermore, while agreeing about a tangible world is
perhaps less demanding, ﬁnding common ground for intangibles is deﬁnitely far more
complex. This is where safety and risk come in. Like risk, safety is intangible. Although
people can develop norms and standards for safety measures and calculate risks asso‐
ciated with these, safety and risk are also experience-based, that is, they are informed
by feelings and emotions [15]. This is where things become muddy and confusion,
dilemmas and conﬂicts can arise.
The development process described above is a ‘natural’ process; it takes place
continuously, whether we want it or not. An assessment of this process for the purpose
of measurement seems therefore useless. Moreover, the outcome of this process is highly
unpredictable, as it depends on the composition of the group, their tasks and the situation
they ﬁnd themselves in. However, the outcome is something that works for this group
and when they have established it, they are disinclined to give it up. That is why cultures
are so hard to inﬂuence. That is also why cultures are neither good nor bad; culture

107

provides the common ground onto which its members can accomplish something
together.
5
Inﬂuencing (Safety) Culture
A model like the one depicted in Fig. 3, provides some possible handles to inﬂuence this
development process. In the end, that is the main reason why, for instance, safety
professionals bother about culture at all. Given the fact that the assessment of culture is
both cumbersome and descriptive, it raises the question of the actual use of such assess‐
ments. And when a culture ﬁnally has been carefully described, nudging a culture into
a desirable direction is yet another challenge, which is improbable to succeed in the way
intended, again due to the nature of the concept of culture and its ambiguous relationship
with what can be observed. An alternative to this ‘gap-analysis’ approach is warranted.
It goes as follows.
First of all, members of a culture (insiders) are best-equipped to truly understand
their own culture, to understand what is really going on and why. Instead of explaining
their cultural core to outsiders, they can better make it explicit to themselves. If possible,
they can explain to themselves where their cultural assumptions initially come from. By
revealing their shared assumptions, they will also discover how these assumptions work
out in daily practice and what their eﬀect on safety might be. Finally, when a cultural
assumption has a negative impact on safety, insiders can work out means to inﬂuence
this assumption, or to moderate it. This, of course, sounds easier than it is, but let us take
a look at Fig. 3 anew and see how it can assist in inﬂuencing a particular cultural
assumption.
Step 1 of Fig. 3 is concerned with understanding, with giving meaning to the
surrounding world. Perhaps shared meanings around the safety of some activities, meas‐
ures, or objects (installations) are not fully in line with the actual risks involved. This
could be revealed through recurring incidents or accidents, or because workers have
conﬂicting practices as they understand of conditions or situations in a diﬀerent way.
Harmonizing the way they understand of the situation might be therefore desirable. This
is often done through communication or, more speciﬁcally, risk communication. The
particular type of risk communication involved is called ‘care communication’, that is,
‘communication about risks for which the danger and the way to manage it have already
been well-determined through scientiﬁc research that is accepted by most of the
[people]’ [16]. Setting up an eﬀective (care) communication strategy is well-established
but specialized work. It is a typical top-down approach, but the target group is usually
involved [17].
However, while culture is about assumptions and understandings shared by a group,
to establish such shared understandings Step 2 (Exchanging) is mandatory. Here, the
nature of the exchange is crucial; as stated above, it should be two-way, open and based
on genuine interest and respect [14]. Only then, valid information can ﬂow to and fro
and when agreement is reached, it is based on shared, pertinent information. Again, this
sounds easier than it is, and somebody like Chris Argyris has spent much of his career
writing about this challenging process, which is also part of what is known as
108
F.W. Guldenmund

‘organizational learning’ [18]. Importantly, the people that engage in Step 2, should be
well-informed, otherwise the exchange is not based on valid information and the
outcome is biased or distorted. This also highlights the importance of the ‘care commu‐
nication’ of Step 1.
The ﬁrst two steps are decisive for the rest of the process. Formalization should be
based on true consensus, otherwise group members will not adhere to what has been
formalized. Again, involving the targeted group members in the process of formalization
is highly desirable and can be used as intervention measure for this step.
When disseminating cultural assumptions, one should not only consider formal
education and training as channels but also group socialization processes. When
newcomers are introduced to the group, they are much inﬂuenced by these processes.
Putting real eﬀort in socialization and joining newcomers with, for instance, ‘safety
buddies’, experienced group members that embrace its (safety) cultural values, will
obviously help them understanding the local (safety) culture [19].
As already stated above, the regular daily process runs from Step 1 (Sensemaking)
to Step 5 (Reinforcing). This is because people’s daily reality already makes sense
through many established cultural meanings. However, this is also the downside, as
these meanings can be misinformed (not based on all or wrong information) or outdated
(the situation has changed drastically), and, hence, not supporting safety anymore.
Keeping silent in such cases, simply means agreement.3 However, going against the
grain of consensus is often not easy, which brings us back at Step 2 (Exchanging).
Establishing an environment where people can openly voice their concerns or disagree
with current practices is key to creating a culture for safety; I prefer this term rather than
safety culture, as the latter invites to reiﬁcation.
The development process of culture is a natural and continuous process. Its content
is determined by how people understand their surroundings. To establish a culture for
safety, safety should be embedded in this process. In doing so, safety will gain more
meaning and depth in the organization up to the eﬀect that safety becomes a value. It
will be that safety still has to compete with other organizational values, yet it will not
function as an afterthought anymore, something that has been stapled on, simply because
it is required.

Abstract. The idea that an organizational workforce as a collective can have the
attribute of being ‘collectively mindful’ points towards a readiness to respond
through stable cognitive processes and variability in actions which are needed to
maintain system functioning and manage system ﬂuctuations when the unex‐
pected happens. This paper reviews recent theory and research on the concepts
of Organizational Mindfulness and Mindful Organizing with a view to imparting
understanding on how the collective workforce plays a key role in the manage‐
ment of the unexpected by using the ﬁve principles of organizational collective
mindfulness. Suggestions for strategically enhancing these organizational mind‐
fulness concepts are discussed to enable enhancement of an organizational resil‐
ience safety culture.

Introduction
The idea that an organizational workforce as a collective can have the attribute of being
‘collectively mindful’ sprung out of the theory on High Reliability Organizations (HRO)
[1]. These high hazard organizations are focused on being ready for the unexpected with
strategic eﬀorts directed towards an anticipation and readiness to respond through stable
workforce cognitive processes and variability in workforce actions, which maintains
system functioning and manages system ﬂuctuations when the unexpected happens.
Organizations outside of the HRO status are increasing recognizing the importance of
being resilient in the face of unknown and unexpected events and acknowledge that they
must strive to be able to respond eﬀectively to system ﬂuctuations. Organizational resil‐
ience is discussed here with a view to both instilling current theory and modelling on
the subject matter, and then proposing some insights around how this concept might be
strategically enhanced as part of wider organizational strategy.
Organizational resilience is understood to be the ability of an organization to respond
to operating ﬂuctuations and to successfully manage the unexpected when it occurs. This

becomes a paradox between system stability versus system renewal and results in a
requirement for skilled management of a complex dynamic relationship between main‐
taining order and growth, and renewal after disorder [2].
The previously mentioned writing by Weick, Sutcliﬀe and Obstfeld [1] was early in
the assimilation of HRO theory into more mainstream organizational theory, but pointed
towards the value of understanding how HRO’s “embody processes of mindfulness that
suppress inertia” (p. 31) to enable organizational system ﬂuctuations to be successfully
managed. In studying HROs it was found that the key to their eﬀectiveness appeared to
be the close relationship between the workforce and a repertoire of actions conducted
by the workforce, where a variety of action was required in order to maintain the stability
and resilience of the organization as a whole.
This variety of workforce actions represents a movement away from ridged and
prescriptive processes and is necessary to enabled system ﬂuctuations to be eﬀectively
managed by the workforce at crucial times. At the group level, it is expected that workers
would be capable of taking notice of new or developing variables within the system, in
a sense increasing the organizational adeptness to become aware of and deal with
changing workplace issues as they arise. In essence workers become collectively
‘mindful’ of what is happening within the system in which they operate [1] in order to
respond in a way that manages system and workplace instabilities as they arise, with a
view to preventing any escalation into more serious occurrences.
Of importance was the notion that two elements in fact come into play, being a
combination of stable cognitive processes and variations in action patterns, which enable
the more successful HROs to manage unexpected events eﬀectively [1, 3]. The ability
of organizations to become resilient became anchored into these cognitive process of
the workforce whose actions needed to be ﬂexible, responsive and at the same time
focused on the best possible outcomes in the face of failures which may have severe
consequences.
The concept of organizational resilience is usually seen as a strategically driven
initiative by top management, often being associated with internal safety and risk
management endeavours and expands to pre-emptive organizational tragedy manage‐
ment strategies around positive organizing [4]. HRO theory proposed that at the group
and wider organizational mindfulness level, ﬁve principles grounded around cognitive
inquiry and interpretative capabilities for action, make up what has become called
‘collective mindfulness’ [1], the necessary ingredient in organizational resilience. The
now widely recognized principles of collective mindfulness are (1) Preoccupation with
Failure; (2) Reluctance to Simplify, (3) Sensitivity to Operations, (4) Commitment to
Resilience, and (5) Deference to Expertise [2]. These processes are also processes of
mindful organizing and enable awareness, wisdom and reliability [4].
The ﬁrst empirical validation of the ﬁve principles of organizational mindfulness
was presented in 2011 by Ray, Baker and Plowman [5] who conducted research within
business schools and measured the perceptions of organizational mindfulness based on
worker’s roles ranging from deans, associate deans, assistant deans down to department
heads. Results showed that perceptions of organizational mindfulness were positivity
associated to proximity of role to the top of the organization. Meaning, the higher one
is in the organizational hierarchal structure the higher one’s perception of organizational
112

mindfulness appeared to be. The results also acknowledged that worker’s role within
the organization is an important consideration, as it is linked to what is ‘seen’ within the
organization, therefore those workers closest to the front line, have a very diﬀerent view
of the organization than those at the top, responsible for the strategic operations [5, 6].
The research being presented here was interested in exploring how strategic eﬀorts
should be directed if the desire is to increase collective mindfulness with a view to also
enhancing an organization’s resilience maturity. Of signiﬁcance for enhancing organi‐
zational mindfulness culture are the notions that (1) shared perceptions of collective
mindfulness vary across various workgroup levels, and (2) that perceptions of organi‐
zational mindfulness have been shown to be positively associated with proximity of role
to the top of the organization.

Collective Mindfulness
Theory around organizational mindfulness progressed in 2012 to the development of a
model [7] (see Fig. 1) spring boarded from the writing by Ray, Baker and Plowman [5]
and which attempted to reconcile conceptual puzzles building up around the theory of
collective mindfulness, particularly as to whether it is strategic, top-down and enduring
[5] or focused on operations as bottom-up and fragile [7].
Fig. 1. Reconciling organizational mindfulness and mindful organizing
The model developed by Vogus and Sutcliﬀe [7] to reconcile the issues, suggests
that two separate actions are in fact in play, that of ‘organizational mindfulness’ and
‘mindful organizing’, both of which are required to enable organizations to achieve
improved levels of organizational mindfulness as a collective.
It proposed that two distinct mindfulness actions are undertaken within an organi‐
zation by diﬀerent levels of the workforce based on the roles that they perform. They
postulate that there are inherent diﬀerences between top administrators who are

performing more of a strategic ‘organizational mindfulness’ role compared to the front
line workers who undertake a more ‘mindful organizing’ role, with middle managers
playing an equally important translating and enabling role between the other two organ‐
izational levels, as seen in Fig. 1.
Weick’s [4] work which discusses positive organizing and organizational tragedy
also supports a tripartite model by maintaining that positive organizing takes the form
of respectful interaction at the workforce (micro) level, heedful interrelating at the inter‐
group (meso) level and mindful organizing at the organizational (macro) level (p. 215).
More recent research by Reitzig and Maciejovsky [8] into corporate hierarchy and
vertical information ﬂows supports the role of middle managers as information conduits
suggesting there is a “reﬁned picture of the true role of middle managers within the
strategy information process” (p. 1996) however it was also acknowledged that this
information sharing role is not straightforward or without its challenges [8, 9].

Organizational Mindfulness - The Five Key Principles
Organizational mindfulness is described as the extent to which a particular organization
is able to assess threats that may emerge and capture such detail so that they are able to
respond quickly and reliably to prevent incidents or system failures [10]. Collective
mindfulness is manifest in organizations by an ability to be sensitive to changes in the
work environment, continuous updating of the way in which they think and perceive
things and by appreciating the importance of context [3].
Research now supports the notion that collective mindfulness can be measured
within mainstream organizations by assessing ﬁve principles [5, 7]. These ﬁve processes
include (1) a Preoccupation with Failure, (2) Reluctance to Simplify, (3) Commitment
to Resilience, (4) Sensitivity to Operations and (5) Deference to Expertise [10]. Organ‐
izations that have the ability to successfully combine these ﬁve principles, detailed in
more depth below, are able to successfully detect and manage unexpected events and
therefore enhance organizational resilience [1].
3.1
Principle 1 - Preoccupation with Failure
Principle 1 relates to the way that the organization and its workforce notice and deals
with failures. Failures in this context is not necessarily large safety events but cover a
range of issues including deviations, risks, bad news items, surprises, things out of
context, near misses and errors [10]. A preoccupation with failure “is a pre-occupation
with maintaining reliable performance … and reliable performance is a system issue”
[10, p. 55]. Organizations that are mindful display an understanding that long periods
of successful outcomes can breed complacency. Any small failure within the system is
seen as a precursor for a larger issue at a later date and eﬀort, attention and action is
required to ﬁrstly notice small issues and then to take action to ensure they are not just
the beginning of something bigger. For this reason, they are preoccupied with failure
and are continually looking for lapses, errors and faults that may be precursors to poten‐
tial failures [11]. It is these concerns about failure that are a quality that makes mindful
114
K. Klockner

organizations distinctly diﬀerent. They have a tendency to analyze and become preoc‐
cupied with shortfalls that seldom occur. However, failure concern alone is not the only
thing organizations need to focus on and sensitivity to variety is encompassed in
principle 2.
3.2
Principle 2 - Reluctance to Simplify
Principle 2 focuses on the organization’s ability to manage variation and identify signs
that the unexpected is unfolding [10]. Successful HROs displayed a belief that work
tasks and the environment are complex systems and as such, they are reluctant to simplify
practices, procedures and interpretations [1]. They have a tendency to restrict simpliﬁ‐
cations enabling a greater number and variation in precautionary measures to be estab‐
lished and implemented [12]. Simpliﬁcations of the way in which interpretations are
made of situations are considered high risk to HROs. They do not want their workers to
just keep going ahead with tasks when their interpretation and intuition identify anoma‐
lies that may lead to dangerous situations [1]. HROs encourage their workforce to take
the time to assess systems and double check processes even when they appear to be
successful or when claims are made that they are successful. Procedures developed and
practiced by HRO’s are thorough, complex and formalized through documentation and
systems that match the complexity of the environment and task [13]. They are also
acutely sensitive to operations, which is elaborated on as principle 3.
3.3
Principle 3 - Sensitivity to Operations
A deﬁning feature of a collectively mindful organization is that the front line operators
display high levels of situational awareness and strive to understand what is happening
in the present and they are always looking for what may happen in the future [11]. These
front line operators at an individual and collective level develop an overall big picture
of the organizations operations [3] enabling a prevention of accidents and failures
through anticipation of future events [10].

Principle 4 - Commitment to Resilience
Mindful organizations that are successful in avoiding and preventing disabling occur‐
rences are able to demonstrate a commitment to resilience by dealing eﬀectively with
errors and unexpected events. They are not disabled by such errors but rather are able
to mobilize themselves in order to deal with them [1]. When HRO’s are eﬀective, they
are able to develop anticipation and therefore prediction of potential dangers before they
occur. When an unanticipated danger does occur these organization is able to initiate
actions and responses to cope and rebound.
System reliability is a focus for HROs however, they also understand that reliability is
tied to the concept that they must have a workforce that is able to investigate, learn and act
without knowing in advance, what the initiating event will be. This is a capacity and
mindset to be able to anticipate and then be flexible in recovery action repertoires to
enable functioning to continue. It also requires quick feedback to ensure actions are

resolving the unfolding issues; both learning from experience and the ability to question
current actions is a fine balance in managing previously un-encountered failures. In these
situations it helps to have the right people dealing with the issue as described in Principle 5.
3.5
Principle 5 - Deference to Expertise
The ﬁnal principle in mindful organizing is deference to expertise [1, 10]. When oper‐
ations are functioning normally there is an organizational hierarchical structure that
deﬁnes roles and responsibilities including lines of communication and reporting. In
emergencies however this organizational structure may be relinquished to enable the
most experienced people to be the ones dealing with the problem.
Deference to expertise is a belief that experience and expertise must be applied to
variations in normal functioning regardless of workforce hierarchical positions. It has
been argued by critics of this ﬁnal process of mindful organizing that in times of critical
emergencies it is inevitable that decisions are going to be made by the front line operators
on the ground because in these situations there may not be time to refer decisions up the
chain of command [14].

Current Research Exploring Workforce Shared Perceptions
To examine further the concepts put forward thus far, research was conducted on the
perceptions of collective mindfulness of both front line workers and middle managers
as proposed by the Vogus and Sutcliﬀe model [7]. The focus was on measuring the
perceptions across the ﬁve principles of organizational mindfulness to see if perception
level was linked to role as suggested by Ray, Baker and Plowman [5] and whether the
notions and model put forward by Vogus and Sutcliﬀe [7] could be elaborated on when
enhancing organizational mindfulness culture.
In order to explore the principles of organizational mindfulness further ﬁve organi‐
zations in the marine industry in Queensland, Australia took part in a research project.
These organizations represented commercial vessel tourism operators (n = 2), ship
repair, construction and management (n = 2) and a hydraulics engineering company
(n = 1). Ethics approval was obtained from the Central Queensland University’s Low
Risk Ethics Committee.
A total of 163 participants were surveyed with (n = 125) being front line workers
and (n = 38) being in the manager/supervisor category. Participants were asked to rate
their responses to 25 questions related to the ﬁve principles of collective mindfulness
within their organization. To measure organizational mindfulness a Collective Mind‐
fulness Survey (CMS) was developed for the research presented here. The CMS is a
self-report measure made up of 25 questions with ﬁve questions covering each of the
ﬁve principles of organizational mindfulness. Participants were asked to answer using
a 5-point Likert scale with response options being (1) Always, (2) Often, (3) Sometimes,
(4) Seldom and (5) Never. The CMS has good internal consistency, with a Cronbach
alpha coeﬃcient reported as .959, but the CMS is yet to be empirically validated.

Results
To compare the organizational mindfulness scores for middle managers and front line
workers across the ﬁve principles of organizational mindfulness, a comparison of mean
scores for both groups was conducted with an independent samples t-test using SPSS
version 21. In all cases middle managers scored higher than front line workers (see
Table 1) supporting previous research on this matter [5].

one gets closer to the top of the organization [5].

Organizational Mindfulness Culture Discussion
Several questions on how to enhance organizational mindfulness culture still remain
unanswered in this theoretical domain. These include whether enhancement will be
achieved by focusing on a top-down processes or bottom-up processes [5] and whether
increasing individual mindfulness would transfer to increased organizational mindful‐
ness? Whilst individual mindfulness is not traditionally measured or associated with the
ﬁve principles of organizational mindfulness, it has been found to be positively related
to workplace safety, the more positive dimensions of personality, and reductions in
human performance cognitive failures [15, 16]. In some respects it would be thought
that enhancement of individual mindfulness would transfer to enhancement of work‐
group mindfulness via workgroup interactions and would contribute to the 5 principles
particularly around the ‘noticing’ of emergent system issues. These question have been
suggested as areas where further applied research is required and point toward the future
of organisational mindfulness and resilience research work. This may be little comfort
for those wanting deﬁnitive answers now, but suggestions for organization culture
enhancement can be oﬀered based on what is already known, and are oﬀered at this
point.
Strategically Developing a Resilient Safety Culture
117

Previous research, including the research presented here, has demonstrated that
organizational mindfulness and its 5 principles can be measured including across various
workgroups, and the results give organizations a starting point from which to understand
the shared perceptions of their workforce. This information can point towards where
diﬀerences and deﬁciencies across the ﬁve organizational mindfulness principles exist.
Strategic eﬀorts can then be directed towards those areas in need of enhancement.
Research results have also established that organizational mindfulness is perceived
to be higher as worker roles get closure up the organizational hierarchical ladder towards
more strategic positions. Critically thinking on the subject, is this the best outcome for
organizational resilience? Should those at the top of the organization be perceiving the
organization as more mindful than those further down, based on what is known about
the cognitive and action system anchors which make up the ﬁve principles? Presented
here is the view that organizations should be striving to inverse this trend and enhance
the organizational mindfulness of front line workers in an eﬀort to achieve increased
organizational resilience maturity. Further consideration points to support this notion
are therefore presented.
The model by Vogus and Sutcliﬀe [7] emphasizes the signiﬁcance of the mindful
organizing actions required of the front line workers to maintain operational outcomes.
These are theoretically the cognitions and actions undertaken by this workforce and
embedded within the ﬁve principles of organizational mindfulness. These front line
workers are the collective workforce who are required to mindfully organize to accom‐
plish these principles, of course with the help of middle managers who enable these
workforce actions. Mindful organizing must incorporate the ﬁve principles of organi‐
zational mindfulness to a high level to achieve continued successful operational
outcomes within complex and ﬂuctuating systems and hence safeguard organizational
resilience.
Whilst it is acknowledged that front line workers are conducting mindful organizing
activities it is suggested that theoretically it would be desirable that their level of percep‐
tion of collective mindfulness for the organization, should be equal to if not higher than
those at other more senior levels further removed from the front line, where the opera‐
tions take place. Timely and critical action response repertoires mostly fall into the
domain of front line workers, who are closest to where the organizational operations are
conducted and where system ﬂuctuations are ﬁrst noticed and felt.
It is therefore proposed that strategically, top administrators and managers, those
responsible for improving organizational mindfulness strategic outcomes, should be
striving to inverse the identiﬁed research trending and focus eﬀorts on increasing their
front line workers perceptions of organizational mindfulness.
Organizations of course, want and need top administrators who drive organizational
resilience endeavours and who understand the role that organizational mindfulness plays
in achieving this goal, but their view/perception of the organization is often a far cry
from those at the front line, as previously discussed.
Of importance then is the recognition by top administrators (as suggested by the
model) that operational outcomes are predominately the results of the workforce closest
to the ‘action’, as they are the ones exposed to system ﬂuctuations at the coal face on a
daily basis. The front line workforce have a critical role to play and therefore, they
118

importantly must be the ones who espouse collective mindful principles to the highest
level within the organization for it to be truly resilient.
Middle managers no doubt play an important role too and are the “individuals who
make decisions about how to implement the organization’s strategic objectives … inter‐
pret information and make it meaningful to those below them in the hierarchy who are
responsible for technical activities… and see more and diﬀerent aspects of rare and
unusual events” [17, p. 912]. Mindful organizing has been widely recognized as a social
sensemaking endeavor and the principles of mindful organizing show managers that
reliability in dynamic contexts involves “a matter of consistency in checking, revali‐
dating, decontextualizing and adapting as a perpetual process” [18, p. 223].
In examining organizational mindfulness from a systems leadership perspective [19]
increased organizational mindful leadership at the middle management level could, in
theory, transfuse in all directions permeating organizational mindfulness culture within
the organization via its system wide interconnectedness.
In conclusion, levels of shared perceptions between workgroups should be under‐
stood via measurement (organizational mindfulness surveys) and areas of lower conver‐
gence identiﬁed. As the idea has been postulated that weak shared perceptions will aﬀect
mindful organizing activities, [20] an understanding of where these shared perceptions
are weak, enables strategic mindfulness eﬀorts to be enacted to increase the strength of
shared perceptions.
Enhancing organizational mindfulness and resilience culture must lie in developing
the ﬁve principles widely throughout the workforce, particularly towards the front line
workers, with both top administrators and middle management supporting this work‐
force to become organizationally more mindful in the undertaking of their mindful
organizing activities.

Summary
Presented here is recent research, theory and modelling around the concepts of organi‐
zational mindfulness and mindful organizing in relation to organizational resilience. Of
particular interest was the development of a model proposed by Vogus and Sutcliﬀe [7]
in order to reconcile how diﬀerent workforce roles within an organization might lead to
two distinct actions systems, one of ‘organizational mindfulness’ and one of ‘mindful
organizing’ which could be explained across three workforce domains.
As well, as some food for thought around strategic enhancement of organizational
resilience was advocated based on recent applied research. In particular, the research
presented here examined further the perceptual diﬀerences of organizational mindful‐
ness between front line workers and middle managers with a view to understanding if
trending across the workforce supported previous research [5].
Previous research [5, 17] has also shown that organizational mindfulness can be
inherently fragmented due to role specialization, e.g. operational v strategic and hence
diﬀerent perceptions of organizational mindfulness may logically exist depending on
where one sits in the organization. Conﬁrmed by the research conducted here was the
notion that perceptions of levels of organizational mindfulness have been found to be
Strategically Developing a Resilient Safety Culture
119

perceived to be higher the closer one is to the top of the organization [5]. However the
view point put forward here is that this may not strategically be a good thing for organ‐
izations wishing to achieve higher levels of organizational resilience and it is suggested
that organizations generally try and balance or inverse these workforce hierarchal
diﬀerences.
Well accepted is that for organizational mindfulness to produce both strategic and
operational resilience it needs to operate across all organizational levels. It must be
envisioned by top administrators, synchronized across levels by middle managers and
translated into important workforce actions, particularly on the front line. Front line
workers must be enabled to enhance mindful organizing actions by reﬁning processes
and routines based on the ﬁve principles and these need to be enabled by middle
managers, translated to, and supported by top administrations as part of the wider stra‐
tegic plan.
Top administrators, who are responsible for directing strategic leadership eﬀorts
towards enhancing both collective mindfulness and mindful organizing maturity, are
now able to measure and assess this concept within the organization, and use this infor‐
mation to improve both strategic and operational outcomes, particularly around organ‐
izational resilience and managing the unexpected.

Abstract. Regulator safety culture is a relatively new area of investigation,
even though deﬁciencies in regulatory oversight have been identiﬁed in a
number of public inquiries (e.g., Piper Alpha, Deep Water Horizon). More
recently, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s report into the Fukushima
disaster speciﬁcally identiﬁed the need for regulatory bodies to have a positive
safety culture. While there are clear parallels between duty holder safety culture
and regulator safety culture there are also likely to be differences. The present
study adopted a two-phase approach that (1) used literature review and inter-
views with 13 safety culture experts to develop a framework on regulator safety
culture and (2) used leanings from Study 1 in combination with items developed
by a safety culture working group to develop and evaluate a regulator safety
culture survey. The importance of regulator safety culture incites the need to
develop valid and reliable tools to assess this construct.

Introduction
Safety culture is well supported as a critical factor that impacts organizational safety.
Across industries such as nuclear and oil and gas, investigation reports of major
accidents have consistently identiﬁed cultural threats as contributing factors [1–4].
Regulatory agencies are tasked with overseeing the safe operation of licensees. Thus,
ensuring that a regulator’s oversight approach fosters continuous development of
licensee safety culture is a critical factor in fulﬁlling the regulator’s mandate of
ensuring safe operation.
The Fukushima Daiichi accident report appears to be one of the ﬁrst accident
investigations to identify regulator safety culture as a contributing factor in accident
causation. This report highlighted the importance of regulator’s having legal authority,
technical competence, and a strong safety culture in order to effectively oversee the
safety of licensees [2]. While safety culture frameworks and strategies for assessment
for high-risk organizations have gained popularity over the last decade, representation

and assessment of regulator safety culture has not been well established. The intangible
nature of safety culture has long resulted in debate regarding representation and best
practices for assessment. Conceivably, identifying and assessing the culture of the
regulator that best promotes safety culture in its licensees is not without challenge and
has likely contributed to the limited scientiﬁc research in this area. Combined with the
growing acknowledgment of importance, this paucity of research prompted the fol-
lowing two-phased study to ﬁrst, develop a framework of regulator safety culture, and
second, develop and evaluate a regulator safety culture perception survey.
1.1
Regulator Safety Culture
With the exception of a case study aiming to deﬁne the organizational culture of a
Finish regulator [5], only a small number of works have begun to identify frameworks
for regulatory oversight thought to best inﬂuence operator safety culture (e.g., [6, 7]).
Bernard [6] aimed to develop a model representing safety culture oversight in order
to promote the development of assessment tools and foster regulator’s “safety culture
observation” [6]. In short, Bernard’s work focuses on identifying a practical approach
to identify signals of licensee’s safety culture functioning in order to shape appropriate
regulatory response [6]. Most closely aligned with the intent of this research is the
guidance document published by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and
Development (OECD) on safety culture of an effective nuclear regulatory body. This
work combines ﬁndings from discussions with members of a Senior-level Task Group
on the Safety Culture of an Effective Nuclear Regulatory Body, as well as the outcomes
from an NEA Workshop on Challenges and Enhancements to the Safety Culture of the
Regulatory Body, to establish principles and attributes for the safety culture of an
effective regulatory body. The present study aims to investigate this phenomenon using
a broader lens by utilizing safety culture expertise from professionals with various
industry backgrounds.
It should be noted that while this paper uses the term “regulator safety culture,”
debate exists concerning the most appropriate term for this concept. This debate is
partially attributable to the various deﬁnitions of safety culture; one review identiﬁed
18 deﬁnitions of safety culture and climate, demonstrating the variability in how this
construct is described [7]. Unlike high-risk organizations whereby safety culture
impacts safety outcomes of that organization, the safety culture of the regulator rep-
resents the cultural features of regulatory functioning that inﬂuence the safety culture of
licensees. Thus, the deﬁnition of regulator safety culture must appropriately represent
this unique context and degree of separation between cultural functioning and safety
outcomes. Considering this, the following deﬁnition of safety culture is used in
deﬁning regulator safety culture:
“…that assembly of characteristics and attitudes in organizations and individuals which
establishes that, as an overriding priority, protection and safety issues receive the attention
warranted by their signiﬁcance” [8].
Development and Initial Testing of a Regulatory Body Safety
123

Using this deﬁnition, regulator safety culture may be more easily assumed to
include the values, attitudes, competencies and patterns of behavior that determine the
commitment to, and the style and proﬁciency of, the regulator’s oversight approach.

Study 1: Framework Development
2.1
Purpose
The purpose of Study 1 is to use ﬁndings from the aforementioned publications on
regulator safety culture in combination with expert opinion to produce a framework
representing regulator safety culture.
2.2
Method
Materials and Measures. Thirteen one-on-one semi-structured interviews were con-
ducted on different days over the course of four months. Participants were provided an
informed consent form detailing voluntary participation, study content, and conﬁden-
tiality of the data. Interviews were conducted by telephone and recorded using com-
puter audio software. Written notes were recorded using a laptop computer.
Procedure and Participants. A participant solicitation list was compiled by identi-
fying safety culture experts through publications, practice, and asking safety profes-
sionals for recommendation of names. Participants were contacted by e-mail by the
researchers and arrangements were made to complete a telephone interview. Thirteen
participants (23% female) were recruited for volunteer participation. Participants were
from around the world and recognized for having expertise in safety culture. Partici-
pants identiﬁed as being employed as academics or practitioners in a variety of
industries. Upon completion of the interview by the second author, audio recordings
were sent to a transcriptionist. On return, the second author ensured any identifying
information was removed from reports and supplied the documents to the ﬁrst author.
This step was completed due to the ﬁrst author’s pre-existing relationship with many
participants. Data saturation was tested and met following principles outlined by
Francis et al. [9]. The proposed study involved no direct threat or risks to participants.
2.3
Study 1 Results and Discussion
The purpose of Study 1 was to develop a framework of regulator safety culture by
interviewing professionals in a range of industries whom have expert knowledge of
safety culture. Results from the interviews included representation of the construct of
regulator safety culture and highlighted the importance of investigating this construct as
well as best practices for assessment.

Participants’ descriptions of regulator safety culture were aggregated to identify the
ﬁve themes represented in Table 1. A brief synopsis regarding the essence of each
theme is also provided. The ﬁve themes represent the notion of employees’ shared
values. Examples of participant descriptions supporting these themes can be found in
Appendix A.
A small number of participants stated that regulator safety culture is equivalent to
safety culture of licensees, and thus, an already established framework could be used to
Table 1. Description of the 5 themes representing regulator safety culture.
Theme
Description
Leadership commitment to
creating a positive safety culture
Leaders’ shared value to ensure the regulator:
(a) adopts a proactive approach to the development of
industry safety, (b) is committed to continuous learning
and self-development, (c) maintains ethical practice,
and (d) is transparent in all activities.
Proactive, risk informed and
ﬂexible approach
A shared value for continuous improvement shaped by
research, collaboration with external agencies, and a
coaching style of management that demonstrates
human value (versus a compliance-only focus).
A willingness to engage in prescriptive versus
performance approaches as needed based on risk, the
ability to guide licensees without overstepping, and
maintaining a belief that behavior is shaped through
leadership characterized by constructive feedback and
contingent reward.
Continuous learning and
self-improvement
A shared value for continuous learning and
self-development. Includes a shared value for adequate
competency within the regulator, openness to learning,
and maintaining an awareness of the limits of
competence.
Unwavering ethical standards
A shared value for upholding ethical standards.
Maintaining a value for professionalism in all conduct
within the regulator and in work with external agencies
(licensees, stakeholder organizations, government).
Unwavering ethical standards in the face of external
inﬂuences (e.g., political pressures, pressures from
societal culture, threat of residential safety or security).
Abiding by the same standards set for licensees and
maintaining fair expectations and independence.
Transparency through
communication
A shared value for communicating internal processes to
keep all parties (regulator employees, licensees, public,
government, stakeholders) informed on regulatory
decision-making and action. Ability to communicate
with external parties in a rational and scientiﬁc manner
and convey sensitive regulatory processes in a manner
that appropriately relays the information and does not
foster the development of premature conclusions.

represent regulator safety culture. Others proposed that because the regulator functions
to ensure safety of the industry and is not a high-risk organization, safety culture
manifests differently, and therefore requires a framework unique to the regulating
authority. As discussed in Sect. 1.1, the authors contend that the unique nature of
regulator safety culture constitutes the development of a new framework to appropri-
ately represent this concept. The ﬁve themes identiﬁed were carefully constructed from
participant suggestions, including statements of themes and comparison with existing
frameworks (e.g., [6, 7]).
There was unanimous agreement among participants regarding the merit of
assessing regulator safety culture. Participants stated that assessment is critical to the
development of industry safety, and one participant claimed that in the wake of the
Fukushima disaster, there exists an obligation to assess safety culture to prevent similar
accidents from occurring. A majority of participants agreed that a multi-method
approach whereby data is triangulated would best support cultural measurement.
Subsequently, these ﬁndings provided preliminary insight regarding a framework of
regulator safety culture and contributed to Study 2: the development of a method for
assessment.

Study 2: Evaluating a Perception Survey
3.1
Survey Development
Building on the ﬁndings from Study 1, Study 2 evaluated a survey that was developed
by an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) working group on regulatory safety
culture. It is important to note that the IAEA subscribe to the use of a multi-method
approach in order to assess safety culture. The development of a survey is to contribute
to this multi-method approach and is not designed to be used as a standalone assess-
ment tool.
The IAEA working group on safety culture developed the survey over a four day
period. The working group reviewed the results from the interviews in Study 1, the
Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) document on regulator safety culture [10] and the
IAEA model on safety culture [1]. The working group expanded the original ﬁve
themes described in Study 1 to 11 dimensions (see Table 2). Once the 11 dimensions
were established, the working group broke up into smaller groups where each
sub-group generated survey items for a different regulator safety culture dimension.
Following item generation, a different group reviewed and reﬁned the items generated
for the dimensions. Finally, the working group as a whole reviewed each sets of items
until a ﬁnal set of 144 items was created.
3.2
Method
Materials and Measures. One hundred and forty-four items were drafted and cate-
gorized into 11 proposed dimensions of regulator safety culture: (1) leadership (e.g.,
Leaders behave as role models for a positive safety culture), (2) psychological safety
126
M. Fleming et al.

(e.g., My organization is free of intimidation), (3) continuous learning, improvement
and competence (e.g., We learn from other relevant organizations), (4) ethics and moral
courage (e.g., It is easy to raise ethical concerns without fear of retaliation), (5) open-
ness, transparency, external cooperation and communication (e.g., My organization
strives to be transparent with all interested parties), (6) independence of the regulator
(e.g., We don’t allow external inﬂuence to compromise safety), (7) responsibility and
accountability (e.g., People are held accountable for their work), (8) systemic regula-
tory approach (e.g., Our interactions with the licensees is based on mutual respect),
(9) decision making (e.g., Safety is the overriding priority when decisions are made),
(10) questioning attitude (e.g., Leaders solicit challenges to their assumptions), and
(11) inter-disciplinary internal cooperation (e.g., Team members share accountability
for their work).
Procedure and Participants. Following item creation, the 144 items were sent to
subject matter experts (SMEs). Two samples of participants were recruited on a vol-
unteer basis through e-mail invitation. Sample 1 comprised of 14 participants with
expertise in (regulatory) safety culture. The SMEs were asked to evaluate (1) how
closely each scale item is related to the speciﬁc safety culture element that it is intended
to assess, (2) the clarity of each scale item, and (3) the importance of each scale item for
safety culture each on a 3-point scale. All SMEs had professional expertise in regu-
latory bodies and their culture. Sample 2 was comprised of 18 employees of nuclear
regulatory agencies (similar to the target population for the scale). These participants
were asked to evaluate the importance of each scale item for safety culture on a 5-point
scale.
Once recruited, participants were directed to an online consent form and prompted
to respond with “Yes, I agree and wish to participate” to proceed with the survey. If
consent was obtained, participants began the study.

had means of 2.70 (SD = .22; how closely each scale item is related to the speciﬁc
safety culture element that it is intended to assess), 2.70 (SD = .19; the clarity of each
scale item), and 2.79 (SD = .17; the importance of each scale item for safety culture)
on a 3-point scale. Sample 1 ratings had an overall mean of 2.76 on a 3-point scale
(SD = .15) across all three rating scales. Sample 2 ratings had an overall mean of 4.50
on a 5-point scale (SD = .20).
In order to shorten the scale to a more reasonable number of items for future use,
the scale items were rank ordered. Speciﬁcally, the mean responses for each of the three
questions in the Sample 1 data and the single question in Sample 2 were calculated for
each item. The means of the three questions in the Sample 1 data were then averaged to
create an overall mean rating. Ranks were created for the overall mean of Sample 1 as
well as for the mean of Sample 2. Finally, the Sample 1 and Sample 2 ranks were
averaged together to create an overall rank. In order to reduce the scale items, we
retained half of the items in each dimension with the highest overall rank (highlighted
in bold in Table 3). This process resulted in reducing the total amount of scale items
from 144 to 71.
The purpose of Study 2 was to evaluate a working group’s development and
evaluation of a perception survey. The initial scale contained 144 items based on 11
dimensions (i.e. (1) leadership, (2) psychological safety, (3) continuous learning,
improvement and competence, (4) ethics and moral courage, (5) openness, trans-
parency, external cooperation and communication, (6) independence of the regulator,
(7) responsibility and accountability, (8) systemic regulatory approach, (9) decision
making, (10) questioning attitude, and (11) inter-disciplinary internal cooperation).
These items were reviewed by experts and employees of nuclear regulatory agencies.
These results were used to reduce the scale to 71 items.
Interestingly all of the scale items (even those we removed) were rated favorably by
both those with an expertise in safety culture and employees of nuclear regulatory
agencies. This suggests that by adopting a systematic approach an expert working
group can develop effective perception survey items. The next step is to examine the
psychometric properties of the reduced scale by surveying a convenience sample of
staff from nuclear regulators.

Summary and Concluding Discussion
The present study aimed to establish a framework of regulator safety culture and
evaluate a perception survey based on this construct. As described in Study 1, ﬁve
themes were identiﬁed from safety culture experts’ descriptions of regulator safety
culture: (1) leadership commitment to creating a positive safety culture, (2) proactive,
risk informed and ﬂexible approach, (3) continuous learning and self-improvement,
(4) unwavering ethical standards, and (5) transparency through communication.

As well, experts identiﬁed the need for more research on this concept and development
of tools for assessment. Study 2 attempted to address this need by evaluating the 144
regulator safety culture items developed by a working group on safety culture. The
results of this evaluation were used to identify the 71 most positively rated items.
Limitations existed in the present studies. For example, the sample used in Study 1.
Participants were subject matter experts in safety culture but not all participants had
experience in a regulatory environment. Thus, ﬁndings may have presented differently
if participants had extensive regulatory experience in addition to safety culture
expertise. In the second study, both SMEs and regulator employees were very positive
in their assessment of the survey items, which made it difﬁcult to reduce the number of
questionnaire items. It is therefore possible that good items will not be included in the
next phase of questionnaire evaluation.
The need for regulatory bodies to better understand their inﬂuence on operator
safety culture is highlighted by ﬁndings from accident investigations. Understanding
this inﬂuence as a manifestation of regulator safety culture has recently been presented,
prompting new direction for this research [2]. Moreover, to date, no scales have been
published measuring this construct. The current study produced a framework repre-
senting regulator safety culture and evaluated an initial draft of a regulator safety
culture perception scale. More research is needed to further reﬁne the scale and future
research should assess its factor structure and the relationship between the scale’s
dimensions and relevant organizational and safety variables.
It is hoped that the ﬁndings from this study provide a ﬁrst step in facilitating
assessment of regulator safety culture in order to advance a regulator’s ability to
oversee industry safety and prompt additional research on representative frameworks
and assessment methods.

Abstract. Emotions play an important role in risk perception. There are many
ways in which users’ personal feelings can impact their evaluation of and
reaction to product risks. Strong emotions and overall affect can inﬂuence
behavior and decision-making in a manner distinct from related stimuli. In order
to explore this relationship, the process of risk-beneﬁt analysis is observed
through an evaluation of several different activities and products, such as
adrenaline sports, gambling, and smoking.

Introduction
Product users’ emotions impact their evaluation of and reaction to risk; ﬁve facets of
this relationship are explored. Several strong emotional responses are isolated and
discussed regarding their overall effects on comportment and decision-making pro-
cesses. Affect, an overall psychological state of feeling ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ is
explored in terms of the impacts and limitations of this construct. An assessment is
presented concerning the impact of risk and beneﬁt perceptions through the lens of
select activities and products. Finally, adolescents are evaluated as a distinct group,
with an emphasis on how their development inﬂuences risk perception and behavior.

Anger, Fear, and Anxiety
The experience of fear is a useful tool in order to avoid potential dangers while
navigating through life. Thus, the inability to sense fear becomes a disadvantage
because perceived threats cannot accurately be assessed. The neurological basis of
emotion resides in the amygdala, which is a structure located in the limbic system. The
amygdala plays a key role in encoding emotional memories and is responsible for
modulating emotional memory storage throughout the cortex [1].

Studies on rats have shown that animals with lesioned amygdalae display no fear
response in addition to ﬂat affect; notably, these rats did not display a ﬁght or ﬂight
response to dangerous stimuli, including snakes. Case studies in humans, most
famously patient S.M. [2], provide information on this phenomenon; S.M. did not show
any fear response due to a damaged amygdala. When researchers exposed her to stimuli
that would ordinarily cause a fear reaction (snakes, rats, and a haunted house tour),
patient S.M. showed no sign of fear even though she exhibited other emotions. This
suggests that the amygdala plays a pivotal role in eliciting fear responses in both
animals and humans.
The Drive Reduction Theory [3] plays a key role in understanding when and why
fear-based appeals work. This theory suggests that any state of unpleasant being, such
as hunger, thirst, and fatigue, needs to be returned to baseline, thus motivating indi-
viduals to act in a way that counters accordingly. Fear is categorized as an unpleasant
state, and based on this theory humans will ﬁnd a way to decrease negative feelings
resulting from fear by cognitively searching for a response that mitigates the circum-
stance. This theory helps to decode the complicated relationship between risk and fear
appeal.
Although at face value, fear appeals appear to be an effective persuasion method or
marketing tactic, this strategy only produces desired outcomes when combined with
planning. A study whose ﬁndings support this claim [4] utilized pamphlets to modulate
both fear appeal and level of planning. The ﬁndings indicated that difference in fear
level had an impact on attitude but not on action. Those who were exposed to high fear
messages in addition to the planning aspect in turn had higher rates of action. It is
important to note that the action plan alone did not have an effect on action or intent;
therefore, both high-fear appeal and an action strategy are necessary to facilitate a
change in behavior.
Anger, fear, and anxiety are powerful motivators for action and behavior. One
behavior that many people try to extinguish is smoking cigarettes. Combining a
common fear, such as mortality or declining future health, with graphic images
depicting lung cancer and other negative impacts of smoking, can have an effect on the
behavior of the smoking population and its intentions to quit.
The consequences of smoking have been widely understood since the Surgeon
General [5] released information on smoking and its impact on health. Smoking not
only affects individual smokers, but also the health of their families and bystanders; the
effects of second-hand smoking are well documented. Anti-tobacco organizations have
campaigned to have cigarettes banned from public areas and have tried to curb smoking
as an addiction. Many studies have conducted text-based fear appeals, but not on the
use of a graphic fear approach.
Graphic fear appeal is the placement of detailed health-related consequences of
smoking on cigarette packs. Researchers [6] have postulated that employing a graphic
fear appeal will increase sensitization as a result of individual smokers constantly
re-evaluating future risk associated with smoking. Results show that fear-based appeal
methods work on certain subgroups of smokers. Individual differences, such as number
of cigarettes smoked per day and disengagement level, explain variance in responses to
a repeated graphic fear appeal. The number of cigarettes an individual smokes per day
inﬂuences the effect of a fear-based appeal because low-count smokers perceive a
134
C. Huyen et al.

lowered risk of smoking consequences compared to high-count smokers. Disengage-
ment level refers to the act of countering cognitive dissonance with phrases such as “I
have old relatives who smoked and lived a long life.” This type of thinking lessens the
effect of a fear-based appeal because it allows for an exception, which in turn is used as
a defense by smokers [6].
Graphic fear-based appeals have high efﬁcacy for subgroups that consist of heavy
smokers and are low in disengagement. Because heavy smokers typically rank higher
in perceived risk of smoking and health consequences, graphic fear appeals contribute
to the level of risk perceived, and therefore have high efﬁcacy for increasing intention
to quit smoking. On the other hand, the subgroup that ranks low in disengagement is
more susceptible to these appeals regarding smoking behavior [6] because their
impression of smoking is not negated by exceptions that would permit them to continue
to smoke without encountering cognitive dissonance. Although it is a difﬁcult task, it is
possible to persuade certain subgroups of smokers to quit, or at the very least garner
intentions to quit. Thus, the efﬁcacy of graphic appeals on cigarette labels indicates
how emotions play a pivotal role in risk taking and product risk perception.
3
Risk Perception and Affect
Affect is the culmination of subtle feelings experienced on a daily basis, resulting in an
overall positive or negative state of being. The affect heuristic suggests that overall
positive feelings result in a perception of lowered risks and raised beneﬁts while
negative feelings are found to have the opposite effect. The limitations of these
observations are described through an exploration of cognitive processes, in which
emotions share an affect that results in risk and/or beneﬁt perceptions.
3.1
The Affect Heuristic and Valence Theory
In analyzing risk perception, it is imperative to discuss the impact of the affect heuristic
and valence effect. The affect heuristic states that when confronted with a decision, an
individual will use the immediate and subjective feeling of general positivity or neg-
ativity about the situation to assess risk. A feeling of positivity signals low risk, while a
feeling of negativity signals high risk. As with all heuristics, the affect heuristic is an
automatic shortcut that aids individuals in making quick decisions while also serving to
minimize cognitive energy expenditure [7]. The valence effect, on the other hand, is a
concept that suggests that the general population tends to expect and overestimate the
probability of positive outcomes, which plays a role in distorting the perception of
risks.
A study [7] examined the relationship between the assessment of risks and beneﬁts
that are inherent in decision-making. The data gathered show that the affect heuristic
has more inﬂuence in time-pressured situations and that risk and beneﬁt are inversely
related. There was a signiﬁcant increase in perceived risk for individuals under time
pressure compared to those who were not, signifying that the affect heuristic functions
in quick decision-making. Additionally, researchers found a causal inverse relationship
Role of Emotions in Risk Perception
135

between risk and beneﬁt, such that if participants were presented with a high-risk
scenario, they would judge it as low beneﬁt, whereas if they were presented with high
beneﬁts, the participants would judge it as low risk. Following this theme, it is possible
that affect is the key that links risk and beneﬁts, which is why the affect heuristic is
important in decision-making.
Although the affect heuristic is useful in making everyday decisions, it is important
to note the limitations of this mental shortcut. While the affect heuristic is generally
correct, when paired with the availability heuristic, described in the next section, it can
lead an individual astray due to the subjective nature of these automatic judgments.
3.2
Cognitive Dimensions
While the affect heuristic is generally useful as a mental shortcut, it is not infallible. For
example, the availability heuristic, which is a mental shortcut based on availability of
information, may be relevant when making decisions; the more often we are exposed to
a certain stimuli, the more we are able to recall it [8]. For example, the general public,
when asked, will agree that earthquakes occur more frequently in California than
Virginia; this is an example of the availability heuristic being accurate. However,
people are also likely to say that more humans die from car accidents than heart
disease, which is incorrect. Although intuitively it would seem that car accidents are
more deadly than heart disease, this is in fact a false perception caused by the avail-
ability heuristic and its portrayal through the media and other avenues. More often than
not, the media reports on fatalities due to car accidents as opposed to heart disease.
Thus, the availability heuristic can work both in our favor and against us, when judging
risk.

Activities and Products: Perception of Beneﬁts vs. Risks
Risk-beneﬁt analysis can be evaluated by discussing its impact on several different
activities and products. Sensation-seeking and emotional control regarding adrenaline
sports and gambling are discussed with an emphasis on addictive behaviors.
4.1
Adrenaline Sports and Gambling: Sensation Seeking
and Emotional Control
Adrenaline sports and gambling are two very different activities, but share many com-
monalities including motivation and an individual’s need to control the environment.
Both adrenaline sports and gambling revolve around polarized risks and beneﬁts [9, 10].
Although the average person may deem adrenaline sports as irrational, an arguably
logical assessment of risks versus beneﬁts still occurs. While fear may not motivate
their decisions, more positive emotions such as happiness and excitement-seeking play
a key role in beneﬁt and risk perception. Although the term “adrenaline sports” is
viewed as a means for sensation-seeking, different kinds of high-risk sports serve
different purposes for those who engage in them [9]. To illustrate, the goal of
136
C. Huyen et al.

mountaineers is to obtain agency through emotional control while on the other hand
skydivers meet their sensation-seeking need through participation in their sport [9].
Skydivers whose need for experiencing high adrenaline levels are satisﬁed after they
complete their jump. The need for emotional regulation is not present because the
nature of the sport is ﬂeeting, leaving no opportunity to gain emotional discipline. On
the other hand, the agency that is experienced by mountaineers serves to increase
regulation of emotions (Fig. 1).
When assessing risk and reward, different motivations need to be considered. It is
easy to characterize seemingly similar activities into one group, yet parsing the dif-
ferences between each unique activity can shed light on the perception of risk and
reward. For example, casinos have tapped into the psychological construct of providing
hope of big wins, but actually supplying huge losses, and yet continue to have cus-
tomers return to the slot machines. What is it that makes gambling so attractive to many
people, and how is the perception of risk involved?
The addictive quality of gambling can be analyzed in relation to reinforcement
strategies, coupled with environmental factors [11]. Reinforcement strategies stem from
behavioral psychology, which includes shaping behavior via rewards. There are many

Role of Emotions in Risk Perception
137

different types of reinforcement strategies; the most applicable strategy is variable ratio
schedule, when rewards are offered after a variable amount of trials, rather than after a
set number of trials. This increases the level of anticipation for participants. The type of
reinforcement schedule employed to shape behavior inﬂuences the extinction rate of
the behavior. Continuous reinforcement has a high rate of learning, but a rapid rate of
extinction; once the rewards stop, the behavior will cease quickly. The variable ratio
schedule takes the longest for participants to learn, but in return, has a very slow
extinction rate.
Gambling uses the variable ratio schedule of rewards, which explains its addictive
qualities. The variable ratio schedule creates a belief that says, “Maybe I’ll win big if I
spin just one more time”— the key to gambling addictions. Coupled with the fact that
extinction takes longer for this type of reinforcement schedule, gambling is an activity
that both prevents people from being able to perceive immediate risk and causes them
to forgo thinking about long-term risk [11].
Environmental factors also inﬂuence the desire to continue gambling. Casinos are
usually dimly lit and do not have clocks, creating the illusion of timelessness. Addi-
tionally, casinos often hire attractive people, appealing to our innate perception that
attractive people possess desirable qualities and characteristics; thus, the presence of
reward cues, attractive people, lessens the impact of losses, and as a result leads to
behavior that increases ﬁnancial risk [12]. This allows patrons to continue gambling
despite their likely ﬁnancial decline.

Interpersonal Relationships
Interpersonal relationships are crucial to accessing certain feelings, such as love and
belonging. With the increase in technology, the landscape for building relationships has
changed, thus altering the nature in which we connect with one another and the risks
associated with it.
5.1
Social Media and Dating
Social media often plays a signiﬁcant role in dating in today’s world. The increasing
inﬂuence of the internet and social networking sites (SNS) has changed the landscape
of interpersonal relationships in recent years in astonishing ways. Allowing people to
communicate and to create relationships online without face-to-face contact is a sig-
niﬁcant difference from the past. Although it may seem more convenient, online dating
can have negative consequences on self-esteem.
The use of SNS, such as Facebook, have been empirically shown to have a pro-
found effect on self-esteem. Because SNS provide easy access to information about
other people’s lives, people can compare themselves to others. Studies show that
individuals who use Facebook most frequently have lower self-esteem as a product of
constant upward comparison [13]. The purpose of comparing oneself to others satisﬁes
the innate need to belong and to exist as a contributing member of society. SNS

However,
comparing

to
more
superior-seeming individuals results in upward comparison, thus lowering self-esteem.
Self-esteem is critical in maintaining relationships. Individual level of self-esteem is
highly indicative of emotional regulation and behavior in situations of risk. When
confronted with relationship conﬂict, high self-esteem (HSE) individuals tend to per-
ceive the relationship in a more positive light compared to low self-esteem (LSE) in-
dividuals. These differing perceptions produce two different motivations for conﬂict
regulation. HSE individuals pursue approach-directed goals, whereas LSE individuals
move towards avoidance-directed goals [14]. HSE individuals tend to seek intimacy
and closeness with their partner, while risking rejection. Their goals extend beyond the
relationship to situational rewards and an increased level of risk in the hope of gaining
a higher level of rewards. LSE individuals respond to risk by inherently protecting
themselves, and pushing their partners away in fear of perceived impending rejection;
this strategy is more conservative and risk-averse.
Research indicates that vulnerability between intimate individuals is imperative for
a successful relationship. This can be achieved if both people believe that their feelings
are being reciprocated; people do not want to risk rejection by being vulnerable to
someone who does not mirror their affections. HSE individuals correctly assess that
their partners see them in a generally positive light, whereas LSE individuals contin-
uously underestimate the positivity in which their partners view them [15]. This ﬁnding
suggests that LSE individuals are less satisﬁed in their relationships because they use
themselves as a template for how they are perceived, an example of false consensus
bias. LSE individuals cope with their vulnerability by creating distance and hesitate to
become more intimate. They also tend to become less generous and attribute negative
events to their partner’s disposition, which ultimately results in less relationship
satisfaction.
High use of social media decreases self-esteem as a result of upward comparison,
and causes negative outcomes for those with low self-esteem. Because of the inherent
risk of rejection that comes with dating and relationships, people with low self-esteem
react in a way that protects them from emotional harm [14, 15]. In these cases, the risk
of rejection clearly outweighs the potential gains of fulﬁlling the need to belong, which
cripples both interpersonal and romantic relationships.
Differences in risk stimuli can affect people’s response to their surroundings as
well. Although it is difﬁcult to empirically study love due to its highly subjective
nature, it is possible to study arousal and how individuals assess risk in certain situa-
tions in order to better understand the underpinnings of attraction and romance.
Prior studies have suggested that fear-based arousal can be misattributed if the
source of the arousal is ambiguous. A study [16] illustrated that men are more likely to
perceive a woman as attractive if their sympathetic responses are heightened, as
compared to resting state. Likewise, a study using roller coasters resulted in similar
ﬁndings [17]; participants were more likely to rate their date as more attractive
immediately following a roller coaster ride versus those who did not ride and who
engaged in an activity with little to no arousal. Both of these studies suggest that
arousal can be misattributed when risk is involved, especially when the source is
ambiguous. This type of misattribution can occur during any activity that causes high

arousal. These two studies support Schachter’s theory of emotion [18], which suggests
that emotion comes after cognition as a result of physical arousal.

Adolescents
Development and experience affect emotional control and risk perception which
inﬂuence adolescent and young adult behaviors. This analysis is related to the
risk-taking behavior and use of products that are considered hazardous, including
alcohol, marijuana and cigarettes, and the emotional component behind their use as
well as propensity for abuse. An adolescents’ self-esteem can contribute to illicit
substance abuse.
6.1
Difference in Emotional Control and Risk Perception
Emotional control, or lack thereof, is a strong predictor of risk perception. Impulsivity,
a measure of lack of emotional control, is a prevalent characteristic of adolescence.
A study [19] investigated the difference between sensation-seeking and impulsivity in
relation to age, evaluating whether they inﬂuence each other. Sensation seeking shows
a curvilinear pattern, peaking between the ages of 12–15. In contrast, impulsivity
steadily decreases in a linear fashion as an individual matures, especially between ages
10–30. Adults generally do not engage in risky behavior as frequently as adolescents
do, which prompts us to believe that there is a correlation between level of emotional
control and risk perception [20]. Overall, it is important to note the differences in
impulsivity and sensation-seeking to better understand how risk is assessed, so that we
may better address serious behavioral issues such as driving under the inﬂuence,
under-age smoking, drug abuse, and unprotected sex.
6.2
Alcohol and Controlled Substance Use
Adolescents are prone to many environmental risks, especially increased opportunities
to consume alcohol, cigarettes, and controlled substances. Decreased emotional regu-
lation and the resulting poor ability to perceive risk, is a characteristic of adolescents,
and plays a part in that cohort engaging in these hazardous activities [21].
In most U.S. states, individuals must be 18 or older to buy cigarettes. Of course,
this does not bar adolescents younger than 18 from gaining access. Although many
adolescents experiment with cigarettes, fewer than would be expected progress to
heavy smoking [21]. This evidence, however, does not suggest that adolescent smoking
is not a pervasive problem. Gaining insight into how and why smoking becomes a habit
is imperative for the health of future generations.
Research in this ﬁeld [21] has examined affect regulation as a cause for smoking.
Affect regulation is the ability to respond accordingly to affective changes, a skill
learned and reﬁned during adolescence. Evidence from recent studies suggests that
affect regulation and mood variability are related concepts, and that both are linked to
smoking outcomes of experimenting adolescents.
140
C. Huyen et al.

The ability to regulate affect has an impact on mood variability. A higher level of
affect regulation results in normal mood variability and is an intrinsic mechanism of
control. Adolescents who are unable to control their affective processes do not have the
necessary intrinsic faculties to stabilize their emotions and instead need an extrinsic
factor to regulate mood. Continuing this line of reasoning, adolescents who have
negative mood variability as a result of insufﬁcient affect regulation are the most prone
to making smoking a daily habit [21]. These adolescents use smoking as a form of
regulation rather than relying on internal regulatory processes.
Within the lens of risk perception, it would seem that adolescents who regulate
mood variability via smoking do not perceive an increased risk associated with con-
tinued smoking due to their improvement in overall affect control. If the purpose of
smoking a cigarette relieves current negative mood tension, then the perceived risk of
future health problems and consequences is not as pertinent, especially to an adolescent
who has difﬁculties managing affect [21]. The process of turning experimental smoking
into a habit is a result of affective change. Adolescents who have negative mood
variability are more likely to start smoking initially, but what determines if it becomes
an ongoing habit is mood variability improvement. If mood variability normalizes over
the course of time, then this improvement reinforces this positive change and therefore
pushes the adolescent past the experimentation point into habit.
Another pressure that adolescents face is exposure to alcohol and the risk of sub-
sequent abuse. Adolescent alcohol use is a serious concern because it has both
short-term and long-term health risks and is prevalent in teenagers in many parts of the
world [22]. One factor that predicts alcohol abuse is the attachment style of the ado-
lescent to three primary groups in their lives: parents, school, and alcohol-using peers.
This type of analysis relies heavily on social learning theories and the inﬂuence of
external interactions as the cause of alcohol use in adolescents. From the beginning,
children learn about the world through imitation and observational learning. As they
enter their teenage years, the role of the parent decreases, and the primary inﬂuence in
an adolescents’ life is the peer group. The pressure to conform is powerful for many
adolescents, especially where alcohol exposure is prevalent.
High attachment to parents and school predicts little to no alcohol use in adoles-
cents, because the adolescents’ need to conform to expectations of these prosocial
groups curbs their interest in experimenting with alcohol. Additionally, individuals
who identify strongly with both parents and school perceive a high level of risk
associated with alcohol because there is no disengagement present [22]. As discussed,
disengaging thoughts are ones that provide an exception to an otherwise negative
activity, which lessens cognitive dissonance and thus increases the chances of engaging
in negative behaviors. On the other hand, adolescents who identify highly with anti-
social groups, or peers that abuse alcohol, are more likely to abuse alcohol because they
do not feel pressured to conform to conventional norms, such as avoiding alcohol as a
minor. Their perception of risk is decreased because the presence of disengaging beliefs
is high, which in turn allows them to have an excuse for drinking alcohol, even though
it is counter to societal rules.
Substance abuse is linked to an individual’s level of emotional regulation. One
interesting characteristic that predicts substance abuse is whether or not an adolescent is
monoracial or multiracial [23]. Within recent decades, there has been an increasing
Role of Emotions in Risk Perception
141

number of multiracial children. These children not only have to deal with the emotional
changes that come with adolescence, but also have to tackle the inability to belong to a
single racial group; they may juggle multiple identities while not identifying with any
one cultural group, which can result in social isolation and increased feelings of
insecurity.
Low self-esteem often breeds insecurity, which entails poor emotional regulation
and other psychological health symptoms. A study [23] found supporting evidence that
corroborates this phenomenon while also linking insecurity to increased levels of
substance use. Multiracial and monoracial adolescents, including minorities, were both
tested. Multiracial adolescents performed signiﬁcantly more negative behaviors such as
substance abuse and violence. Even when compared to monoracial members of
minority groups, multiracial adolescents showed this higher correlation. Multiracial
adolescents constantly have to cope with two racial identities while trying to conform
to norms in order to feel accepted. The struggle with the inability to identify with a
single race has many psychological outcomes that contribute to higher levels of sub-
stance abuse, and low self-esteem.
It is clear that emotional dysregulation and lack of perceived risk play a key role in
adolescents gravitating towards making cigarettes, alcohol, and illicit substance use a
habit. In order to curb these behaviors, it is imperative to target each individual’s ability
to regulate emotions rather than just treating symptoms.

Abstract. This paper aims mainly to present the methodology and the main
results of the diagnosis on safety culture (or human and organizational factors)
carried out in two offshore production platforms in Brazil. The main method-
ological stages were: (i) application of a questionnaire on safety culture and
(ii) group discussion of the divergences of perception among the different
hierarchical levels. The integration among the platforms’ operating teams and
the company’s engineering areas may be pointed as the main condition for the
development of the proactive and generative safety culture.

Introduction
Since its emergence shortly after the Chernobyl accident in 1986, the concept of “safety
culture” has been at the center of concerns of various organizations, professional and
academic communities in the “Safety Sciences” ﬁeld. It emerged as an alternative to the
safety approaches used in high risk companies and organizations. Such approaches
traditionally in use are criticized, above all, due to the limits related to the integration of
the human dimension in its safety practices or, in other words, to the limits related to
the understanding of the speciﬁcity of human nature, its needs and its contribution to
industrial safety.
The approach of Safety Culture or Human and Organizational Factors of Safety
(FHOS) used in this project consisted in identifying and implementing conditions
which favor the positive contribution of the operators and the collectives of work to the
construction of industrial safety. Industrial safety is considered as one that integrates:
• standardized safety – which takes into account anticipations through rules and
procedures – and
• safety in action – which takes into account the workers’ actions (often absent from
the rules) in favor of safety.
To build or to develop a safety culture is to consider the human dimension in
organizations, inviting them to mobilize levers and motivations for action other than
exclusively the compliance to norms.

Integrated Industrial Safety
The knowledge proposed by the approach of human and organizational factors of
industrial safety [1] and by the ergonomics of activity [2] allow not only a better
understanding of what affects human activity, but also to act on the conception of work
situations aiming at the development of a safe activity. Thus, for the development of
safe production units, action on the individuals’ behavior (in terms, for example, of
compliance with rules) is not enough. It is necessary to act, above all, on the project
and transformation of the characteristics of the work situations.
The main way to noticeably reduce the likelihood of emergence of undesirable
behaviors for safety is to act on the situation characteristics, which includes local
characteristics such as the process project, the work place, the tools, and more global
characteristics such as the company’s purchase policies, labor training plans, recog-
nition and sanction policies, among others.
Efforts made in this direction may result not only in improvement in safety results,
but also in quality of production or safety at work (accident frequency rates).
Human behavior is the visible part of something broader: the human activity.
Besides postures, movements, verbal and nonverbal expressions or the use of a tool, the
activity contemplates the body mobilization for this behavior. In other words, behavior
is the visible dimension of the activity, which also includes perceptions, reasoning,
memory, knowledge, decision making, emotions and so on.
Thus, the work activity is a response to different situation determinants such as the
production objectives, the tasks to be performed, safety rules, people’s skills, the means
available and the conditions of work performance provided by the company. The
activity is never the simple performance of a procedure. It is the result of a regulation
process among the different determinants mentioned above.
Recent studies on industrial safety [1] classify human behaviors into two main
categories: human behaviors in compliance with the rule and initiative behaviors.
The behaviors of compliance to the safety rules would be, for example: the use of
IPE, respect for critical procedures such as work permits and inspections, order
maintenance, cleaning and organization of workspaces, the use of the handrail when
going up and down stairs, and so on. The degree of compliance varies according to the
rules, among groups and companies as it is impossible to prescribe motivation, trust
and cooperation.
Initiative behaviors in safety are the second category. In two situations, they are
emphatically mentioned: (i) in situations where there are conﬂicts between procedures
or existing norms and (ii) situations to which there are no prescriptions. In these two
cases, decisions that involve the safety of the premises are the responsibility of those
who face events often unforeseen and unknown. Examples of initiative behavior are:
• To signal risk situations
• To propose modiﬁcations in equipment or work environment
• Various participations in safety improvement activities
• Recovery from real risk situations
• Shared surveillance
• Creation and dissemination of safe practices.

Safety Culture
The deﬁnitions of safety culture are many. It may be deﬁned as a set of beliefs, values
and behaviors shared by the different actors of an organization [1]. For the OGP
(International Association of Oil & Gas Producers), safety culture is deﬁned in a similar
way: it is about attitudes, values and beliefs that support the way things are done in an
organization (“the way we do things here”).
The OGP highlights that:
• A positive safety culture is mostly supported by trust, credibility and the behavior of
their more senior leaders. Trust is considered extremely fragile and, when lost, it is
extremely difﬁcult to recover;
• The search and maintenance of a positive culture in Safety Management System -
SMS is not a discrete event, but a long path. Organizations should never lower their
guard. The companies should make sure that their senior management is always
committed to this long path;
• The development of methods and tools varies according to the level of organiza-
tional maturity: a tool will not produce the desired improvement if the organization
is not ready for it;
• Thus, the use of certain tools may not be effective, and may even be counterpro-
ductive according to an organization’s culture level.
For [3], the main elements of a safety culture are:
• Information: safety culture is information culture, in which data need to be col-
lected, analyzed and discussed in the organizations;
• Report: people have conﬁdence in being able to report safety problems without
generating culprits or punishments;
• Learning: the organization learns from its mistakes and transforms unsafe
conditions;
• Flexibility: the organization is able to reconﬁgure its hierarchical chain according to
events and context;
• Coherence: a culture seen as coherent and fair in relation to acceptable and non
acceptable behaviors, and also trustworthy in effective preventive measures.
For this author, safety culture may be built or “engineered” having as basis the
factors mentioned above.
Based on researches on the practice and safety management tools used in the oil
and gas industry, the OGP has developed a safety culture classiﬁcation for the orga-
nizations and production units, which was used in this work. The main categories of
safety culture for the OGP are presented below:
• Pathological: causes of accidents are solely associated to individuals, especially
those of the lower hierarchical levels; the managers only implement what is
mandatory (including evaluations and audits); the tools do not work well at this
level;
• Reactive: most of the problems are linked to the workforce in the lower hierarchical
levels; simple SMS tools acting only in behavioral issues (unsafe behaviors and
146
F. Duarte

campaigns); in practice, production comes before safety until an accident occurs;
tools that deal with issues that have not yet caused accidents are difﬁcult to operate;
• Calculative: the use of a large number of tools and trainings; the analyzes refer to
the quantitative logics; the tools are often contradictory and may be associated to
risk situations; the tools are almost exclusively top-down; SMS professionals are
seen as the only responsible people for the creation and the use of rules, tools and
SMS performance;
• Proactive: the leaders understand that failures in the management system are the
primary causes for incidents; risk situations and real incidents are daily used to
generate learning situations among the workers; tools that simplify the work are
used; leaders of all hierarchical levels assert the right of refusal;
• Generative: the SMS tools cover all hierarchical levels; mandatory tools do not exist
as they are counterproductive and generate mistrust among the operators; everyone
feels at ease to evidence actual and potential problems; the leaders provide the
necessary support for the problems raised; the workers have power to act in order to
deal with ﬁeld situations.

Methodology
The main phases of the methodological approach used were:
1. Preparation of the questionnaire on the perception of rig safety (including deﬁnition
of shipments);
2. Application of the questionnaire in different groups: (i) the company’s operators and
maintenance technicians, (ii) managers and coordinators, (iii) hired maintenance
technicians, (iv) cargo handling team, (v) hotel team and (vi) supervisors of the
hired teams;
3. Analysis of the answers through Sphinx software;
4. Implementation of discussion groups;
5. Synthesis/Restitutions (meetings of presentations of the research results).
The steps above can be summarized in a quantitative phase (steps from 1 to 3) and
in a qualitative phase (steps 4 and 5), which was based particularly on meetings with
the different groups. The diagnosis quantitative phase had the following main
characteristics:
• Assessment of the perception of safety at all company levels by means of a
60-question questionnaire built from the literature.
• Expressive participation of managers, operators, technicians and workers of the two
rigs (85% of the population of one of the rigs and 77.5% of the other answered the
questionnaire) and different safety aspects were covered.
• Manual individual ﬁlling out in collective sessions per group. Two or 3 sessions
were performed for each group.
• Anonymous: the respondent was not identiﬁed when ﬁlling out the questionnaire.
As mentioned before, the 60-question questionnaire was divided into 5 large themes:
Safety Culture in the Ergonomics Perspective
147

• Reliability of the rules, mistakes and deviations: the goal was (i) to understand
whether the workers and managers believed the rules to be absolutely reliable or if
there might be situations in which the rules are not enough and (ii) to understand if
there are mistakes and violations of the safety rules and why;
• Accidents: the goal was to understand the respondents’ perception about the origins
of accidents, whether the culprits are sought, if there are prevention methods based
on the declaration of ﬁeld anomalies and what the leaders’ corrective measures are
to prevent new accidents;
• Debate on anomalies and reminder of rules: a set of questions sought to understand
the respondents’ perception about the efﬁciency of the spaces for discussion about
safety, such as weekly and daily meetings;
• Safety discourse and practice: the goal was to understand whether the leaders’
practice in terms of safety match their discourse;
• Safety sensation on the rig: part of the questions was dedicated to demonstrate
whether the workers really feel safe in the different work situations they face on the
rigs studied.
The diagnosis qualitative phase was mainly characterized by a set of collective
interviews that mobilized the different groups that answered the questionnaire. A de-
bate on the convergences and divergences of the answers was carried out with each
group separately. The goals were:
• To complement the quantitative diagnosis;
• To clarify the interpretation of certain results of the questionnaire;
• To recover concrete examples of work situations related to safety;
• To deﬁne the main classes of safety problems faced by the work teams according to
the workers’ perception;
• To capitalize the ideas of improvement in terms of safety and accident reduction.

Main Results
As mentioned above, the answers to the questionnaire were treated by the Sphinx
software. This tool allows us to observe the absolute numbers generated by each
answer, in addition to generating graphs, statistics and a general note about each one.
This general note allows for the evaluation of whether there is convergence or diver-
gence between the answers of the different groups. It may be veriﬁed, for example, that
there was convergence between the different groups in relation to:
• Cause of accidents: most of respondents in the different groups believe that acci-
dents are not fatalities or fortuity;
• Availability of Individual Protection Equipment. They all agree that IPE is made
available by the company;
• Management’s incentive to interrupt the work if potential risk is veriﬁed by the
operator;
• Maintenance of order and cleanness is regarded as priority and is always required
by the leaders on board

While there are convergences between the perceptions of the different groups
interviewed, other results point to divergences in other aspects. The divergences ver-
iﬁed in the answers were classiﬁed into 9 different types according to the nature of each
divergence, and they were named as follows:
1. Safety discourse and practice
2. The process of creation of rules and bureaucratization of the system
3. Inconsistency of the rules
4. Safety or Production
5. Blame for the accidents
6. Register and treatment of anomalies
7. Meetings about safety and reminder of rules
8. Safety of the hired workers
9. Safety of the numbers
Based on the answers to the questionnaire, and mainly on the discussion groups, we
can claim that the safety culture of the rigs studied may be classiﬁed, according to the
OGP (International Association of Oil & Gas Producers), as managerial, although
elements of the pathologic culture (for example, in relation to the perception of the
search for culprits) and the reactive culture (which can be identiﬁed by reactive
campaigns towards unsafe behaviors common in the company) can be found.

Discussion
The concept of “safety culture” comes from the awareness that, in spite of all its
contributions, technology is not the only source neither the only solution for the
problems and challenges of industrial safety. This concept was conceived to reintegrate
the human dimension, its competences and symbolic productions (beliefs, values,
cognitive capacities, etc.) in the construction of safe production systems. Aiming to
control the risks related to the operation of complex social-technical systems, safety
culture is considered as a promising alternative in the ﬁeld of industrial safety [4].
The emergence of the notion of safety culture has made it possible to sensitize the
organizations to the challenges of the representations and the value of human work for
industrial safety. It has also made possible to understand how and why the effective
involvement of the individuals in their activities occurs. In a wider sense, it may allow
for the integration of what is experienced in the organizations’ daily activity with the
safety practices. This renewed approach to safety is even more necessary and pertinent
when the organizations have to face unprecedented challenges, born from the com-
plexity of the economic, technical and organizational environment in which they
operate. In this extremely complex environment, strictly technical and managerial
approaches have not favored improvements and present limits already veriﬁed in
practice.
In these thirty years after the emergence of this concept, one may say that con-
sensus has not yet been achieved concerning a deﬁnition and a typical approach for the
construction of a safety culture [5]. The main criticism towards this approach reveals
that its putting into practice only through tools and safety management methods has
Safety Culture in the Ergonomics Perspective
149

emptied the focus on its essence and speciﬁc attributes, thus diverging from its original
project, i.e., the development of the human dimension in safety matters [6]. The
question that arises now is how to rescue this path and build an approach that may
consider the human dimension in its speciﬁcity and not as just a factor like many
others.
To build and develop a safety culture is to consider the human dimension in the
organizations, inviting them to mobilize levers and motivations for action other than
exclusively the compliance to norms. In this sense, the managers’ decisive contribution
for safety and, more speciﬁcally, to safety culture in industrial installations has already
been well established in the Safety Sciences ﬁeld [7].
Likewise, the contribution of the frontline (their own operators and maintenance
technicians as well as those outsourced) is also emphasized in the Safety Sciences ﬁeld
[7]. It is closely related to the practical knowledge developed in the productive units’
daily activity. As complete and well built as the rules may be, they do not apply to all
the situations, either because they contradict one another in some cases (when arbi-
tration becomes necessary between production and safety, time and safety, mainte-
nance and production), or because they do not contemplate all the problems,
unforeseen events and randomness typical of complex production processes. The
frontline performs a daily exercise of deliberations and decisions based on the practical
knowledge [1].
The choice for the OGP classiﬁcation for support to this research project is due to
two main reasons. It is a classiﬁcation widely used and validated by the main world oil
and gas producers and, in addition, it makes it possible to think of actions to promote
the transformation and to move towards a proactive and disseminating safety culture.
According to the OGP, the evolution and transformation of a culture is not a discreet
event, it is a path to be trodden.
But what does changing a culture or developing a safety culture mean? The role of
proximity managers or of those of upper hierarchical levels and their involvement are
decisive here, as already mentioned. But the construction of a safety culture is not only
determined by rules and procedures from the company’s directors. It is established
above all by the experience shared by repetitive and convergent practices [1].
According to the aforementioned author: “safety culture is translated by the awareness
shared that each one has only a part of the information and skills necessary for safety”.
The practices and the spaces for discussion for feedback are more than necessary, they
are a condition for this transformation. Likewise, the development of the individuals’
and the different teams’ initiative behaviors and power of action, in permanent dis-
cussion and dialogue with the process engineers and process safety engineers, super-
visors and managers is something to be pursued in this transformation.
Thus, the actions proposed and discussed with the managers and workers for the
development and evolution of a safety culture at the rigs studied may be summarized in
three main points:

implementation of improvements and the transformation of perceptions.
2. Creation of spaces for discussion for the involvement of the work force with the

activities on the rig.
3. Restructuration of the system of declaration of anomalies (the current system is
discredited for the report of deviations and ﬁeld problems), aiming at:
• Improvement of the alert process
• Implementation of processes of collective discussions of anomalies
• Feedback about the treatment performed.

Abstract. The concern for human lives on construction sites is a major issue
not only for construction stakeholders but also for relevant agencies and bodies
responsible for general health and safety of people in a particular society. In this
study, the level of importance of various construction safety guidelines were
examined with a view to creating better awareness for improved performance of
construction projects. The analysis of the data revealed a minimum mean item
score (MIS) of 4.13 out of the possible 5.00 for analysed safety related variables.
This implies that there is a high level of awareness of various safety guidelines
while the problem of implementation and enforcement of the guidelines persist.
There is therefore the need for consistent and continuous training on practical
implementation of the guidelines and programs by relevant construction training
agencies such as Construction Education Training Agency (CETA).

Introduction
The developing nature of countries like South Africa usually lead to continuous need
for construction products, which implies that the construction industry must be rightly
placed to meet growing demand of the public to sustain the economy. As a result, there
are several issues of concern including safety related ones, which is the focus of this
study. Achieving complete safety performance in construction projects is a difﬁcult task
to achieve due to increasing number of occupational injuries and accidents on con-
struction sites. Ensuring workplace safety is one of the daunting tasks in construction
[1]. It was further noted that there is a high rate of accidents architecture, engineering
and construction projects, and this portrays a bad image of the construction industry.
Yates and Lockley [2] concluded that construction accidents usually occur due to
construction failures, and may result in injuries, illnesses or fatalities to people and
projects at large. Accidents cannot be eradicated but can be minimized. However,
professionals, workers and other stakeholders in the construction industry tend to
ignore various health and safety regulations and this impact badly on the construction
industry, as lives are lost due to fatal injuries. Since the Health and Safety at Work Act
1974 was introduced, the rate of fatal and major injuries bas been on a decrease [3]. The
Act require that appropriate strict measures and policies to control safety be in place for
safety of people in all sectors of the economy, including the construction industry.

Accidents and injuries in construction occur due to lack of attention given to safety
performance and safety procedures.
Lack of knowledge and training, lack of implementation of rules as well as inad-
equate supervision are major causes of accidents on construction sites. Safety man-
agement is key to mitigation of unforeseen accidents on construction sites, and
management behavior is drawing academic attention because it tends to be the root
cause of occupational safety accidents [4]. To ensure safety of lives and properties,
various safety management practices have been identiﬁed to improve organizational
performances. Safety management practices helps in mitigating accidents rates,
improving safety practices, enhancing productivity as well as increasing proﬁtability of
construction companies. Health and Safety Executives [5] noted that up to 80–90% of
accidents at workplaces are because of unsafe behaviors. The issue of construction
safety is of utmost importance and lately, the Construction, Design and Management
(CDM) Regulations of 2015 have reinforced the importance of safety management in
construction industry in a self-regulatory context [6].
The effectiveness and importance of adopting the ISO-system by organizations to
improve their safety measures, especially in the area of environmental policies cannot
be overemphasized [7]. Dodge [8] added that the importance of mandating construction
workers to be certiﬁed health and safety ofﬁcers is necessary in creating awareness of
occupational safety, which can be helpful in successful delivery of construction pro-
jects. In view of the linkage between health and safety and performance, this study
examines the importance of various safety guidelines with a view to improving health
and
safety

during
preconstruction,
construction
and
post-construction phases.

Safety Guidelines in the Construction Industry
Safety management is a way of managing risks in an incorporated manner in order to
reduce accidents rates and improve company’s productivity, thereby enhancing the
economic and ﬁnancial performance of the organizations. Safety management is a
process by which several plans are put together to contain and prevent serious accidents
or damage in an organizational setup [9]. Furthermore, the concept of safety man-
agement system are a set of policies, strategies, practices, procedures, roles and
functions associated with safety [10]. This implies that safety management systems are
tools that are designed and incorporated within an organization, and the essence is to
control various hazards that can affect the health and safety of workers.
Safety management embodies regulations, policies, standards and proactive mea-
sures combined to reduce the risk of day-to-day activities. These policies and standards
are designed either by organization or by industry policy makers to that to promote
safety awareness as well as checkmate operational risk. As such, proactive measures
are put into practice in line with the policies which varies in industries and organization
based on the types of operations as well as their objectives [11].
Safety at work should be the concern of all construction stakeholders including
clients, professionals, contractors and site workers. Construction workers especially
should make it their duty and priority to work safely, they should avoid falling of

objects and persons by following safety measures and regulations put in place on
construction sites.
There are basic steps put in place to evade risks related to work at height. These
steps were prepared for work at height with the aim of regulating such works [12]. The
steps on how to avoid risks related to working at heights include such statements that
every employer must take into account risk assessment under the regulation of man-
agement regulations after they have identiﬁed the measures that are required by this
regulation. The employer must ensure that employees abide by the regulations at all
time during every stages of construction, and that the employer must make sure that
construction work is never carried out at heights where it is realistically applicable to
safely do the work than at heights. In places where work is carried out at height,
employer must take appropriate, adequate, realistic and applicable procedures to pre-
vent injuries and hazard.
It is very vital to contemplate how falls can be prevented to avoid accidents caused
by falling from heights [13]. The Commission for Occupational Safety and Health [14]
of the Government of Western Australia outlined ﬁve steps to prevent the risks of
falling from heights. These include control of the risk of internal falls by fully hitting,
control of the risk of external falls by consecutive erection, control of the risk of falls by
using advanced guard railing systems, control of the risk of climbing falls with safe
admission systems as well as introduction of fall arrest and travel restriction systems. It
is also necessary for construction industries, especially in the developing countries, to
implement similar measures to control the risks of fall from heights.
Fall restraint and fall arrest are absolutely two non-identical procedures to stop fall
from heights on construction sites [13]. The fall restraint does not allow the con-
struction workers to fall completely by implementing strict restraints and the fall arrest
involves the use of multiple and approved safety equipment components. The mainly
used components are body harnesses, lanyards, deceleration devices, droplines, hori-
zontal lifelines, vertical lifelines and anchorages. Using mobile elevated work plat-
forms (MEWPs) is the one of the effective ways to enforce fall restraint [12]. Examples
of MEWPs include such things as, pickers, vehicle-mounted booms and scissor lifts.
Some of the advantages of using these work platforms are that it provide safe means for
workers to work at height, construction workers can easily access work areas, toe
boards and guardrails can help prevent fall from heights; and work platforms can be
adopted for outdoors and indoors purpose.
The Construction Regulation of the Republic of South Africa outlined the impor-
tant health and safety speciﬁcations expected of clients and designers of construction
projects [15]. To ensure compliance with provision of the Act, the client shall prepare a
documented Health and Safety (H&S) speciﬁcation for the construction works; he or
she shall provide any principal contractor who is making a bid to perform the con-
struction work for the clients with the same documented speciﬁcations. The client shall
make sure that the principal contractors (PCs) have made provision for the Health and
Safety (H&S) costs in their tenders, however, the principal contractor and the agent
must be provided with information that might affect the health and safety of any
construction worker on site. The client shall nominate every principal contractor in the
form of writing for the projects on construction sites - the designers or the principal
agent may be the origin of the required information.
154
A. Oke et al.

The client must stop any work that is not going according to the recommended
health and safety plan. This can be achieved by stopping any contractor from executing
construction work that do not comply with the principal contractor’s health and safety
plan for the site, or which can be a threat or hazardous to the health and safety of
construction workers. The client must take responsible steps to make sure that every
principal contractor’s health and safety plans as gritty in regulation are implemented
and maintained on construction sites. The client shall ensure that if there are changes to
speciﬁcation and method of construction, sufﬁcient health and safety information and
suitable resources should be obtainable for the principal contractor so that the work can
be executed safely. The client shall make sure that the prospective principal contractor
during submission of tenders have made provision for all the cost of health and safety
procedures during the construction method. The client also need to ensure that each
principal contractor is registered and in noble position with the compensation fund as
well as with a licensed compensation insurer prior to the work starting on site. The
designer’s input may be required at various stages of construction for better document
preparation geared towards ensuring health and safety of construction workers. The
designers also need to specify the products or materials that may constitute hazard and
health risk during the construction period.

Research Methodology
This study is designed to obtain information on the level of importance of various
safety guidelines on construction sites. Survey design was adopted with the aim of
obtaining information from the respondents. The professionals involved in the study
include architects, quantity surveyors, engineers, construction managers and con-
struction project managers on various construction sites located in Gauteng region of
South Africa.
Data for this research was collected from both primary and secondary sources. The
primary data was collected by the use of questionnaires based on the secondary data
obtained from existing literature materials. The secondary data helped in the con-
struction of questionnaire. The questionnaire was designed as a structured closed-ended
type and 50 of them were administered based on the availability of identiﬁed group of
participants. For ethical consideration, respondents were treated as self-governing
representative and their personal information were not revealed to the public. This was
ensured by excluding conﬁdential and private related questions from the demographic
section of the questionnaire, which forms the ﬁrst part of the instrument. The second
part of the questionnaire was designed to understand awareness of respondents on three
areas of safety guidelines, which include measures to control risk of fall from heights,
ways to prevent injuries and improve safety as well as different ways to ensure com-
pliance with provision of safety Act.
Data collected for this research was analyzed using descriptive statistical methods.
5-point Likert scale was adopted to determine the importance of various identiﬁed
factors. The ﬁrst set of scale includes 1 – Strongly disagree, 2 – Disagree, 3 – Neutral,

4 – Agree and 5 – Strongly agree. The second scale and their meaning include 1 – Very
low, 2 – Low, 3 – Neutral, 4 – High and 5 – Very high. This ﬁve-point scale was
converted to a mean item scores (MIS) and standard deviation (SD) for each of the
factors using the formulae:
MIS ¼ 1n1 þ 2n2 þ 3n3 þ 4n4 þ 5n5
P N
Where:
n1 = number of respondents for strongly disagree
n2 = number of respondents for disagree
n3 = number of respondents for neutral
n4 = number of respondents for agree
n5 = number of respondents for strongly agree
N = total number of respondents.

Findings and Discussion
From the distributed 50 questionnaires, 45 were returned and certiﬁed ﬁt for further
analysis. The analysis further reveals that 13 of them are quantity surveyors, 10 are
engineers, 10 are project managers, 6 are architects, while 6 are construction managers.
The respondents possess an average of about 8 years of experience in the construction
industry, and are located in 6 metropolis of the region which include Akuruleni,
Johannesburg, Metsweding, Sedibeng, Tshwane and West Rand.
The risk of fall from heights and their importance based on the opinions of relevant
construction stakeholders are indicated in Table 1. From the mean item score
(MIS) and the standard deviation (SD) values, control of the risk of falls by using
advanced guard railing systems is the most important with a MIS of 4.49 and SD of
0.589. This is followed by control of the risk of external falls by consecutive erection
(MIS of 4.24 and SD of 0.679), control of the risk of climbing falls with safe admission
system (MIS of 4.22 and SD of 0.636), introduction of fall arrest and travel restriction
systems (MIS of 4.18 and SD of 0.806), as well as control of the risk of internal falls by
fully hitting (MIS of 4.13 and SD of 0.842). The ﬁnding supports study by the
Commission for Occupational Safety and Health [14] of the Government of Western

Australia, which stated that introducing fall arrests and travel restriction systems and
controlling of the risk of internal falls by fully hitting are some of the key measures to
control risk of fall from heights. More so, the Health and Safety Executive [16] con-
cluded that providing the workers a safe means to work at height is an important
consideration in the planning and execution of construction projects.
The Table 2 shows various ways to prevent injuries and improve safety on con-
struction sites. Prevention and addressing of substance abuse by employees with a MIS
of 4.62 and SD of 0.535 is the most important factor, this is followed by considering
safety related issues during the project planning process with MIS of 4.62 and SD of
0.49. Other important factors include making safety a part of everyday conversation
(MIS of 4.6 and SD of 0.539), review accidents and near misses as well as regular
inspections (MIS of 4.53 and SD of 0.505). The ﬁndings further revealed the following
as various ways of preventing injuries and improving safety on construction sites:
making sure the workers are properly trained in appropriate areas; ensuring that the
contractors are pre-qualiﬁed for safety; management of safety related issues; having a
fall protection system; integrate safety as part of the job; and creating accountability at
all levels. The highlighted measures are related to construction safety management,
which support existing assertions that management of safety is one of the ways to
prevent injuries on construction sites [1, 4, 13].
To guarantee safety on construction sites, Table 3 shows various ways ensuring
compliance with provisions of the safety Act, which were earlier discussed in Sect. 2 of
this paper. The most important measure is that the client shall take responsible steps to
make sure that every principal contractor’s health and safety plan as determined in sub
regulation is implemented and maintained on construction sites (MIS of 4.38 and SD
of 0.650). The client shall also appoint each principal contractor in the form of writing
for the project on construction site (MIS of 4.33 and SD of 0.603), and stop work that is
not in accordance with the health and safety plan (MIS of 4.33 and SD of 0.769).
Furthermore, the client shall make sure that principal contractors (PCs) have made
provision for the Health and Safety (H&S) costs in their tenders (MIS of 4.31 and SD
of 0.633), as well as prepare a documented Health and Safety (H&S) speciﬁcation for
the construction work (MIS of 4.22 and SD of 0.850). To ensure compliance with

provision of safety Acts, health and safety plan implementation is the most important
measure expected of construction clients. More so, all the identiﬁed measures were
deemed important in ensuring compliance with the safety Act, which is in line with
various construction regulations [5, 15].

Conclusion and Recommendation
The requirement for safety of lives and properties has been a major concern for indi-
viduals, government and relevant agencies. In the construction industry, various
countries have domesticated health and safety regulations with a view to preventing
injuries, accidents and the likes on construction sites. This study therefore examined the
level of importance attached to various measures for ensuring compliance to health and
safety rules on construction sites. To achieve the objective of the study, three areas of
compliance to safety guidelines were considered, which include measures to control
risk of fall from heights, ways to prevent injuries and improve safety as well as different
ways to ensure compliance with provision of safety Act.
On the risks of fall, external, internal, climbing and general falls were considered.
However, the most important measure is the adoption of advanced guard railing system
to guide against risk of falls from heights. Consecutive erection of building members is
required for controlling risk of external fall while the use of fully hitting system is the
appropriate way to control risk of internal fall. Risk of climbing falls is best controlled
by using safe admission systems while introduction of fall arrest and travel restriction
systems was also deemed important measure for controlling risk if fall from heights.
Another area considered are the ways to prevent injuries and improve safety. There
is a need to address and subsequently address substance abuse by construction workers,
especially artisans and workers that are directly involved in construction activities.

There is also a need to consider safety during the planning and preconstruction phase of
construction project, this will help in the review of accident through regular inspection,
thereby making safety issues everyday conversation. The contractors should have
necessary safety measures and this can be ensured by including and enforcing safety
requirements as part of prequaliﬁcation requirements.
The responsibilities of construction clients as well as their representatives – that is,
construction professionals - in ensuring compliance with provision of safety Act were
also discussed. The ﬁndings of this study indicates that there is a high level of
importance of safety measures and guidelines among construction stakeholders.
However, there is a need for enforcement of safety regulations with a view to
improving health and safety of lives and properties. There is a need for construction
projects’ management commitment to safety as this is a drive for other measures. There
is also a need for good vertical and horizontal communication among employees and
management staff to promote good safety culture. Regular safety meetings should be
organized where such things as improve safety technology, safety records for each
operative, regular safety inspections and ban on abuse of substance including alcohol at
work, should be discussed.

Abstract. In our interrelated world with global market the responsibility and
hence the potential to improve machinery safety lays on several actors including
designers, manufacturers, end users and regulatory, standardization, representa‐
tive, lobby organizations. On one hand according to the “free movement of goods”
concept machinery safety is regulated like the safety of other products, including
involvement of notiﬁed bodies, conformity assessment and international stand‐
ards with mandatory requirements. On the other hand the provision of a safe and
healthy workplace is a well respected value therefore national regulations are
there on the use of tools including machinery in workplaces by workers. In both
area the basic concept of safety is the management of risk, but the two approaches
diﬀer due to the diﬀerences in the quantity and diversity of machinery handled
and due to the knowledge on target group and on the use. Although there several
ways to link design and usage including e.g. standardization, acquisition, user-
oriented design, the risk of machinery at the workplaces is not eliminated and
workplace accidents with machinery still occur. This paper shows how risk
assessment at workplaces and risk assessment in machinery safety should be
connected, how knowledge of workers can be utilized in the design and how in
general usability methodology evolved in software ergonomics can be applied in
machinery design to improve workplace safety.

Introduction
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 59,830 nonfatal occupational injuries and
illnesses involving days away from work in 2015 where machinery was identiﬁed as the
source of injury or illness (Table 1) [1]. Work equipments, including hand tools and
machinery was responsible for more than 100.000 injuries or illness just in the US in a
single year.
European statistics on accidents at work (ESAW) [2] show that fatal accidents due
to working equipments including operating machine and working with hand-held tools
happen relatively rare, but the total number of fatalities is still over hundred in the EU
(Table 2). Accidents with machinery leading to more than tree days away from work
happened 40,918 times. Both table include incidence rates of accidents interpreted as
the number of accidents per 100,000 workers in a year period.

Boy and Limou [3] gave several examples when labor inspectors and other public
authorities or notiﬁed bodies found machinery used in workplaces non meeting essential
safety and health requirements. This study also suggest that these cases are not special
and manufacturers frequently neglect requirements.
Although criteria used in the Composite Ergonomics Risk Assessment CERA [4]
implement safety and health requirements laid down in harmonized standards, and
should be assessed and decreased in the design process, just a few risk assessment ended
without any reds. CERA was created to assess ergonomic risks resulted from bad
postures [5], manual handling [6], force extension [7] and repetitive movements [8] at
workplaces. The risk is unacceptable almost at every machine handling operation due
to bad postures and these twisted/tilted/awkward postures act as contributing factors of
other ergonomic risk decreasing the acceptable manual lifting weight limit or force limits
or movement frequency. Since the EN 1005 standard series contains several independent
assessment neither CERA provide a ﬁnal score, but sums the number of greens/yellows
and reds according to the relevant risks. CERA become popular in Hungary and was
used for hundreds time. The shocking experience is that the question is not whether the
workstation is acceptable or needs improvement but the number of reds, or how to
explain to employers that the tool they are using shouldn’t be installed at the ﬁrst place
due to the lack of compliance of health and safety requirements of machinery.
Several manufacturers work in close collaboration with their consumers, register
every piece of machinery sold and its operators, the designer knows the real user
behavior and this knowledge is fed to the design process and applied. Although the
best collaboration should be expected when the personnel responsible for the safety
in design and the personnel responsible for the operational, the workplace safety, is
the same, these in-house machinery productions often lead to shortcuts, and some
requirements is omitted like no conformity assessment is made or no technical docu‐
mentation is done.

In real designing for human error is not easy partly because that errors are hard to
predict partly because the use proper methods requires extensive expertise and are too
expensive for non safety-critical cases [9]. The number of accidents related to machinery
at workplaces and the wide spectrum of practices and examples of non-conformities
should mean that the link between the design and use is random and indirect, and infor‐
mation on use required in the design phase is not accessible or incomplete.

Design and Operation
The ILO code of practice on Safety and health in the use of machinery ﬁts together
design and operational phases [10]. The life cycle of a machine starts on the left with
design and ends on the right with decommissioning. Designers, suppliers and manufac‐
turers are the key actors on the production side while workers play the user role and
employers bear responsibility for safety on the operational side.
The code of practice expects designers, manufacturers, suppliers, employers,
workers and their representatives to cooperate actively on safety and health in the use
of machinery. The information of malfunctions, dangerous occurrences and accidents
and diseases should be collected, reported at the workplace and feed back to designers
likewise any new risks and measures taken to control end prevent recurrences. This
gathered information on accidents and diseases is supposed to help manufacturers and
designers to understand their product, users, the use, hazards better and should be used
to improve the safety of machinery. The information provided from the feedback from
workplaces allow designers to conduct a proper determination of limits of the machinery
required by the mandatory risk assessment, covering the full range of uses of their
machinery including the intended use and any reasonably foreseeable misuse as well.

European Regulations
In the European Union the Machinery directive regulates the machinery market
according to the single market concept [11]. This directive requires all member states
to operate the same processes and use the very same safety and healthy requirements
when assessing safety of machinery. Core element of the directive are the conformity
assessment, the involvement of notiﬁed (independent, assigned, registered) bodies, the
CE mark with the declaration of conformity and harmonized standards. Harmonized
standards are adopted by a European standardization body (CEN, CENELEC or ETSI)
and published in the Oﬃcial Journal of the European Union [12]. These standards are
not binding but the safety and health level they require must be met. Over 700 Type C
standards deal with deﬁned types of machinery and describe detailed speciﬁc safety
requirements. Type B standards like the EN 1005 covers speciﬁc aspects of machinery
safety or contain safety requirements applicable in several types of machinery. For every
type of machinery set requirements the single type A standard EN ISO 12100:2010
Safety of machinery - General principles for design - Risk assessment and risk reduction
(ISO 12100:2010) [13].
Usability of Machinery
163

The essential health and safety requirements relating to the design and construction
of machinery laid down in this directive adopt the provisions of EN ISO 12100-1:2003
when as part of the risk assessment requires the identiﬁcation of intended use and any
reasonably foreseeable misuse of the machinery, and the hazards that can be generated
by the machinery and the associated hazardous situations. According to the directive
‘intended use’ means the use of machinery as planed and documented in the instructions
for use and reasonably foreseeable misuse’ means other ways of use which may result
from readily predictable human behavior. Principles of safety integration of the directive
states that risk not only related to the conditions foreseen but also to reasonably fore‐
seeable misuse should be prevented and the remaining risks communicated [11].
In the EU the CE mark represents the marketability including the conformity and
the ability to use at workplaces as work tool (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1. Design and operational phases of machinery
The regulation on occupational health and safety matters follows a leveling
approach, and member states have diﬀerent legislations. The frame directive [14] and
several other directives deﬁnes minimum requirements e.g. workplaces [15], ﬁshing
vessels [16], work with display screen equipment [17]. The directive on work equipment
by workers [18] set obligations on employers and workers, and contains minimum
requirements to work equipments. ‘Work equipment’ means here : any machine, appa‐
ratus, tool or installation used at work, and the ‘use of work equipment’ means activities
like starting or stopping the equipment, its use, transport, repair, modiﬁcation, mainte‐
nance and servicing, including, in particular, cleaning.
Performing the risk assessment required by the frame directive these minimum
requirements often used in hazard identiﬁcation.
164
G. Szabó

The feedback from the workplaces to the manufacturers only provided through the
market surveillance process, but no direct link required like the involvement of manu‐
facturers in accident investigation or worker surveys on the use of machinery.

Human Machine Interface
The EU-OSHA report on the human machine interface (HMI) as an emerging risk
summarized that ﬁeld studies are needed to understand organizational and environ‐
mental factors to reduce the risk related to human machine interfaces. It states that
usability engineering not recognized despite the it’s competitive advantage, and users
are involved mostly is validation tests Steps to be taken are e.g. [19].
• improvement and harmonization of accident investigation and reporting,
• usability tests should be applied and extended beyond normal operation, including
emergency situations,
• understanding the speciﬁcs of various worker groups,
• improving user-friendliness systems,
• determination of the ﬁnancial consequences of optimal HMI,
• developers, users and suppliers must increase collaboration.
The deﬁnition of ‘usability’ means the ability of a machine to be easily used owing
to, among others, properties or characteristics that enable its function(s) to be easily
understood [13]. The deﬁnition of usability is broader however. Usability also means
‘the extent to which a system, product or service can be used by speciﬁed users to achieve
speciﬁed goals with eﬀectiveness, eﬃciency and satisfaction in a speciﬁed context of
use’ [20], likewise foreseeable use means the “use of a product that is capable of being
known or anticipated in advance based on a supplier’s best knowledge about the product”
in the consumer product safety approach [21]. These diﬀerences should be bridged and
the broader usability approach implemented to guarantee the safe design aimed by the
user feedback.
The responsibility for identiﬁcation of all plausible scenarios can easily be omitted
when the manufacturer conducts the assessment and issues the declaration of conformity
not being aware several other relevant harmonized standards. When approval authority
are involved the type approval procedure lays the responsibility primarily with them, so
and designers are not forced to consider the implications of their design [22].
By using a participatory design paradigm, manufacturers can understand user needs
from the start of the design process, e.g. use-ware-methods was adapted from web-
design by consumer industry, and later penetrated industrial areas [23].

Feedback Method
The new EN 16710-2 Ergonomics methods – Part 2: A methodology for work analysis
to support design [23] provide a methodology and framework to analyze and understand
end users’ performance with machineries. The work system is describe with the work
activity in focus, and thanks to the system approach it contains both technical and human

A recent European technical report describes the Feedback method to understand
how end users perform their work with machines [24]. The feedback method is a struc‐
tured way to solicit skilled workers opinion [25]. The under laying idea is that some
workers have training and work experience on the installation, operation, maintenance
of the machinery in question and their knowledge can be distilled and documented in a
standardized way. The process mentioned lead by a specialist trough the following steps:
• preparation, collection of information related to the machine in question,
• observation of workplaces where this machine is used,
• structured interview with skilled workers,
• result validation,
• documentation.
The observation aims all the feed back elements suggested in the Design and opera‐
tional phases of machinery (Fig. 1) and covers all aspects mentioned in the “activity
focused work system” (Fig. 2) including all work phases in details from normal operation
166

to unplanned maintenance. Signs of misuse can be identiﬁed by gathering information
on near-misses and accidents with the machine.
Some application show that the feedback method can be used to
• identify design errors or errors of existing standard in the design stage,
• verify and validate existing results,
• monitoring work eﬃciencies [25].
Based on the work analysis a group of skilled workers reconstructs the work activity
and carries out a systematic analysis of each work activity producing e.g. a list of critical
aspects of the machinery.

Conclusion
In spite of the eﬀort made to reduce serious workplace accidents due to machinery use
still happen. Wrong operator behavior is one of the frequently identiﬁed root causes of
accidents. On the other hand wrong worker behavior means unidentiﬁed possible oper‐
ators actions or the omission of foreseeing the operator behavior.
Harmonized standards on methods to collect data of use of equipments used in
workplaces by workers to help designers understand the real use should improve risk
assessments and leading to safer and healthier products.
There is no denying that like the feedback method usability methods are time and
labor-intensive, but they allow designers to predict operator’s activity and make a safer
machinery such decreasing the equipment related risks at workplaces.

Abstract. In order to prevent accidents related to undergraduates on campus,
contributory factors of undergraduates’ unsafe acts were analyzed. By con-
ducting a survey and data analysis, factors leading to unsafe acts and quanti-
tative relationship among these factors and unsafe acts were studied. A structural
equation model (SEM) expressing causes to unsafe acts was built. The results
showed that university safety investment, university safety management, safety
awareness of undergraduates and inﬂuences from their family had direct impacts
on unsafe acts of undergraduates, and safety awareness had the most signiﬁcant
impact. It was also revealed that safety training at university, safety education at
secondary school, relationship among students had indirect or less inﬂuence on
preventing undergraduates’ unsafe acts.

Introduction
Accidents among undergraduates at universities aroused widespread concern in public.
It is found that unsafe acts of undergraduates are main causes to these accidents, and
preventing undergraduates’ unsafe acts is an effective intervention to accidents on
campus [1]. Therefore, it is of signiﬁcance to study on the contributory factors leading
to unsafe acts of undergraduates.
Some researchers argue that unsafe behaviors of workers are caused by both
individual factors (e.g. physical, psychological, knowledge and skills) and external (or
objective) factors (e.g. environment, organizational management) [2]. Other researchers
believe that internal factors leading to employees’ unsafe behavior include personality
traits, safety awareness on site, safety knowledge and safety competence. External
factors are considered to be a combination of organizational factors, environmental
factors and leadership factors [3].
Wang Yonggang etc. develop a structural equation model to show the contributing
factors to employees’ unsafe acts, which indicates that internal factors include experi-
ence, attention and memorizing ability; and external factors include work task, team
management and system characteristics [4]. In coal and mining industry, causes to
people’s unsafe behavior are summarized to human physiological factors, psychological
factors, human-machine matching factors, safety management, safety culture, personal

life events [5]. Guo Binbin points out that the factors which affect the unsafe behavior of
miners in China include safety climate, personal factors, work pressure and work
environment [6]. Choudhry concludes that the leading factors to employees’ unsafe
behaviors in construction industry include organizational management, safety proce-
dures, psychological characteristics, self-esteem, work experience, work performance
measurement pressure, risk awareness, work environment, safety training etc. [7].
At present, research methods on contribution factors to unsafe behaviors are mainly
questionnaires, interviews, and literature analysis. The data are normally analyzed by
SPSS, LISREL, SMART-PLS and AMOS [8–10].
The causing factors to unsafe behaviors are studied mainly in coal mining industry
and civil aviation industry. The results of these studies show that contributing factors to
unsafe acts vary in different industries. Up to now, there are few studies on contributory
factors to unsafe acts of undergraduates. In this situation, the author tried to ﬁnd out the
inﬂuencing factors to undergraduates’ unsafe acts by conducting surveys and data
analysis.
2
Method
A questionnaire was developed in form of Likert Scale to ﬁnd out the common unsafe
acts of undergraduates and the possibly relating information. A SEM was designed to
indicate the inﬂuencing factors of undergraduates’ unsafe acts. SEM is a model that
relies on empirical analysis to establish the structural relationship among variables and
verify the rationality of the hypothesis. The process of SEM analysis has ﬁve steps,
which are model setting, identiﬁcation of the model, estimation of the model, model
evaluation, and model revision.
2.1
Questionnaire
Through pre-survey, literature review, student interviews and expert interviews, safety
awareness, safety management, safety investment, safety training, relations among
undergraduates, safety culture, inﬂuence from family, and safety education received from
secondary education were identiﬁed as main contributory factors to undergraduates’
unsafe acts. These factors were summarized to four categories. The author designed
several questions which could reﬂect each contributory factor (Table 1). The question-
naire had 41 questions, each of which had ﬁve answer choices (totally agree, agree, hard
to say, disagree, totally disagree).
2.2
Data Collection
210 questionnaires were handed out and 196 were received, with a response rate of
93.33%. The sources of undergraduates who were enrolled to answer the questionnaire
are shown in Table 2.

Reliability and Validity Analysis of the Questionnaire
Cronbach’s alpha, which is one of the most widely used indicators of reliability in the
social and organizational sciences, was used in the reliability analysis. The criteria for
Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcient used in this research was shown Table 3.
SPSS program was used to analyze the reliability of the questionnaire. The internal
consistencies of questions relating to safety awareness and student relationship were

relatively low, but still within the range of the acceptance. All the other questions
relating to other contributory factors held high internal consistencies (see Table 4).
Exploratory factor analysis was used to verify the structural validity of the ques-
tionnaire, and KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin) test was applied to the contributory factor
categories. Validity refers to the degree to which the measurement objective can
accurately be measured by the questions. If KMO value is 0.9 or higher, it is very
accurate; 0.8 means accurate; 0.7 means normal; 0.6 means inaccurate and 0.5 or less
means inaccurate at all. The KMO values of the questionnaire were shown in Table 5.

Assumptions for Developing SEM
The following assumptions were made for each contributory factors according to the
way they might affect undergraduates’ unsafe acts:
Personal safety characteristics:
H1: Undergraduates’ safety knowledge had a positive impact on improving safety
awareness.
H2: Undergraduates’ safety awareness had a positive impact on reducing unsafe
acts of undergraduates.

SEM Development
Before a SEM is used, it is necessary to verify whether the model meet the require-
ments to analyze the relationship among the contributory factors. Violation estimation
is needed. Negative variance could not exist, and the normalization coefﬁcient cannot
exceed 1. The measurement error of the variance in the model was 0.044 to 0.135, and
there was no negative variance. The normalization coefﬁcients were in the range of
0.016 to 0.935, which did not exceed 1. Therefore, the model could be used for further
analysis. AMOS software was used to design the SEM, and the parameters were tested
to be full of requirements. The parameter values were shown in Table 6.
The relationships among contributory factors were represented by a diagram, which
was shown in Fig. 1.
An initial test was conducted about the initial SEM, the test results were shown in
Table 7.

In this table, S.E. is the standard error of the parameter; C.R. is critical value; and P
is the signiﬁcance probability. *** means the signiﬁcance probability is 0.000, which is
less than 0.05.
The reference value of the C.R. was 1.96. It could be seen from Table 8 that the C.R.
of 9 paths exceeded the critical value. And inﬂuence routes with a P less than 0.05
indicated that the routes passed the signiﬁcance test. H8 and H11 held C.R. less than
1.96 and P greater than 0.05, which meant that these two inﬂuence routes did not pass
the signiﬁcance test.

SEM Revision
There were two assumptions in the initial SEM that were not justiﬁed by the data,
which were positive inﬂuence from family had a positive impact on safety awareness of
undergraduates and the safety education in secondary schools had a positive impact on
reducing the unsafe acts of undergraduates. These two assumption routes were deleted
to make the model more accurate. A revised SEM was shown in Fig. 2.
The comparison between the revised model and the initial model was shown in
Table 8. Compared with the initial model, the revised model was improved to be more
reasonable.

Discussion
The ﬁnal SEM had nine assumption routes. High safety awareness of undergraduates
had a very positive impact on reducing unsafe acts. The relationship among students
and safety culture could affect their safety awareness, which indirectly inﬂuenced the
unsafe acts of undergraduates. Good relationships enabled undergraduates to care for

and help each other so as to reduce unsafe acts. The safety training on students and the
safety education that they accepted at secondary school could have direct impact on the
safety knowledge of undergraduates and then improve their safety awareness to avoid
unsafe acts. Safety management at university, safety investment and inﬂuences from
family could directly affect the students’ unsafe acts.
The correlation coefﬁcient between high safety awareness and undergraduates’
unsafe acts prevention was 0.932. The correlation coefﬁcient between positive family
inﬂuence and undergraduates’ unsafe acts prevention was 0.498. Good safety man-
agement at university had positive impacts on preventing undergraduates’ unsafe acts
with a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.468. The correlation coefﬁcient between good safety
training and improving undergraduates’ safety knowledge was 0.663. Good relation-
ship among undergraduates had a positive inﬂuence on improving undergraduates’
safety awareness, and the correlation coefﬁcient between them was 0.695.
The results indicated that safety awareness, inﬂuence from family, university safety
management, safety training and students’ relationship had great inﬂuence on under-
graduates’ unsafe act prevention. By contrast, safety investment of universities, safety
education in secondary school and safety culture had less contribution to prevent
unsafe acts of undergraduates.

Conclusions
To our knowledge, it was the ﬁrst research on contributory factors to undergraduate’s
unsafe acts. The reliability and validity of the questionnaire were veriﬁed, and a SEM
was established to express the inﬂuencing routes of each contributory factors. The main
conclusions are as follows:
(1) There were mainly nine contributory factors to undergraduate unsafe acts, which
were safety awareness; safety knowledge, safety management; safety investment;
safety education at university, relationship among students; safety culture, inﬂu-
ence from family and safety education at secondary school.
(2) These contributory factors shared different importance in their way to inﬂuence
undergraduates’ behavior on safety.
The number of respondents in this study was relatively limited, and more under-
graduates from different universities were suggested to be involved in future research to
improve the result.

Abstract. Falling from high is an accident type with high frequency and high
death rate in construction industry. It occupies nearly 60% of the total accidents
in construction industry in China. Human factors contribute to most of this
accident type. 56 accidents were analyzed utilizing 24 Model in this paper,
which was an accident causation model developed by one of the author.
19 categories of unsafe acts were identiﬁed from the falling accident analysis.
Unsafe acts involving both frontline workers and managers were studied.
Moreover, 2 key unsafe acts, insufﬁcient training on workers and defects on
usage of safety belt or safety helmet, were identiﬁed to contribute to nearly 80%
of the accident. The results provided guidelines to develop interventions for
preventing falling accidents. Results obtained in this paper can be used by
companies in their occupational safety strategies and design of safety training
programs.

Introduction
Falls are highly frequent accidents in construction industry and occupational fatalities
and injuries caused by falls from height pose a serious public problem worldwide.
Falling accidents constitute 52.25% of the reported accidents in construction industry in
China in 2016 [1]. A more comprehensive understanding of causal factors leading to
fall incidents is essential to prevent falls in the construction industry.
Contributing factors to occupational fatal falls are identiﬁed with respect to the
victim’s individual factors, the fall site, company size, and cause of fall by Chi et al.
[2]. Falling accident are classiﬁed to several patterns, and causes to each falling
accident patterns are analyzed. Among the causes, bodily action is pointed out to be a
contributing factor. However, no concrete unsafe act is analyzed.
Chi et al. present accident causes associated with each falling site as a fault tree to
provide an overview of the basic causes, which could trigger fall fatalities in the
construction industry [3]. A decision trees analysis of construction falling accidents
involving roofers was constructed to extract rules that show the associations between
attributes for roofer fall accidents. [4] The results showed that fatality chances

increased with increasing fall distance and decreased when safety training was pro-
vided. The most important input attributes in the models were identiﬁed as the fall
distance, fatality/injury cause, safety training, and construction operation prompting
fall. Kun Hu etc. point out that factors commonly associated with falls included
working surfaces and platforms, workers’ safety behaviors and attitudes, and con-
struction structure and facilities [5].
To our knowledge, most of the research are on the relationship between attributes
and falling accidents and no research is on the speciﬁc unsafe acts analysis. This paper
aims to ﬁnd out the what unsafe acts lead to falling accidents and their frequency,
which may be beneﬁcial for design safety training for mangers and frontline workers to
prevent future unsafe acts.
Different types of studies including surveys, interviews, questionnaires, case
studies, accident/incident records, observations and controlled laboratory experiments
in various disciplines have been conducted to elaborate contributing factors. And
learning from the past is a good way to ﬁnd out what we want. So, case study was
adopted as the research method in this paper.
The methods that researchers use to analyze accidents are critical to aid our
understanding of causes. 24 Model was developed from the view of behavior safety by
Fu et al. [6]. It is easy to use in analyzing unsafe acts leading to accidents. And, some
valuable conclusions have been get using this model. Study on Unsafe Acts of
Explosives Spontaneous Combustion Accidents in Underground Coal Mines and mine
blasting provide valuable information on identifying speciﬁc interventions for pre-
venting unsafe acts by workers and managers [7, 8]. Therefore, in the paper, the authors
provided an analysis on contributing unsafe acts to falling accidents through analyzing
falling cases on construction sites.
2
Methods
56 accidents from 2000 to 2016 were collected from internet or books published. The
information of these 56 accidents were all accident reports from the government. These
accidents were analyzed in detail using 24 Model. 3 researchers analyzed the 56
accidents separately. After they ﬁnished all the analysis, a group discussion was
conducted to get an agreement on the result.
In the process of analyzing, causes are described into four types, which are root
cause, radical cause, indirect cause and direct causes (see Fig. 1). Direct causes include
unsafe acts and unsafe conditions. Both unsafe acts from front-line workers and their
managers are identiﬁed. These indirect causes related to individuals are consequences
of defects of organizations, which are inadequate safety culture and faults in safety
management system. Safety management system include necessary documents and
safety management human resources.
Analysis on Human Unsafe Acts Contributing to Falling Accidents

24 Model was adopted in this paper because of the following two reasons. Firstly,
24 Model is suitable for analyzing accidents related to systems which are not very
complicated. Normally, the mechanical systems on construction site are not very
complex. And, without much decision making occasions, what people should do is
normally complying with ﬁxed procedures. Secondly, accidents in construction
industry are dominantly caused by human behaviors. And, 24 Model analyzes acci-
dents based on behavior safety theories.
Since, we focused on unsafe acts in this paper. Only part of the analyzing results,
direct causes part, was used in this research.

Results and Discussion
We got 296 unsafe acts in total. 213 unsafe acts were conducted by managers, whereas
83 unsafe acts were from front-line workers. There were 5 unsafe acts in each accident
occurrence in average. These 296 unsafe acts were classiﬁed into19 categories. There
were certain category of unsafe acts, such as failure to follow the construction orga-
nization design, might be conducted by either workers or managers. In this paper,
managers meant people did not directly work with equipment. They usually did paper
work, organization or supervision.
The frequency of unsafe acts were shown in Table 1. The order of unsafe acts was
arranged according to the frequency of its occurrence.

Defects on safety training
The top two categories of unsafe acts were defects on safety training and
application of PPE (safety belt and safety helmet). These two categories of
unsafe acts shared the same frequency. There were two situations of defects on
safety training. The ﬁrst situation was no safety training was provided, and the
other one was no effective or adequate safety training was provided. The dif-
ference between defects of safety training on managers and workers were also
analyzed. We could know from the result that safety training on managers
normally were implemented, however safety training on workers were more
often to be neglected. And, inadequate safety training occurrence frequency was
nearly the same as the safety training absence occurrence frequency (Table 2).

Without or improper use of PPE
Another important contributing factors leading to falling accidents in construction
is without or improper use of PPE, which are safety belt and safety helmet. Safety
belt and safety helmet are both necessary for working at height. However,
working without either safety belt or safety helmet and working with neither of
them lead to 51% of the 56 accidents. And, working without safety belt occurred
with a much higher frequency than working without safety helmet. Incorrect use
of safety belts caused 11% of the accidents. Working without PPE was sometimes
because no PPE was provided, which was with a percentage of 7% (Table 3).
(3)
Failure to follow the construction organization design
This unsafe acts occurred 23 times in these 56 accident, which was a quite a high
frequency. 6 of this unsafe acts were organized by managers, and 17 of them
were conducted by front line workers. This factor was usually identiﬁed in
accidents which caused more than one death. Workers might start work before
necessary safety facilities were installed. Or, the necessary facilities did not meet
the design requirements.
(4)
Defects on safety instruction before work
Safety instruction before work is a very important document, which is legally
required in China. Managers should delivered the safety instruction before work
to all the workers and signatures of workers are required to certify that they was
told about the safety instruction. In 15 accidents, workers did not received safety
instruction before work, and workers did not receive adequate safety instruction
in 7 accidents (Table 4).

(5)
Failure to eliminate the hazards
There are safety check or hazard identiﬁcation during the construction work.
A follow-up hazard elimination should be done if hazards are identiﬁed. How-
ever, there were 39% of the accidents are partly caused by failure to eliminate
hazards timely.
(6)
Inadequate safety supervision on site
Lack for supervision on site also contributed to many falling accidents (34%).
The competence and conscientiousness of supervisors on site inﬂuenced the
result of safety supervision. And there was another situation, which was that no
supervisor was assigned on site (Table 5).
(7)
Defects on routine safety check
Routine safety checking is an effective way to identify hazards and correct
violations. Nearly 20% of the accidents had problem on safety checks. In 11
accidents, managers did not conduct safety check, and there was a big mistake in
safety check in the other one accident (Table 6).
(8)
Assign unqualiﬁed worker to do special work
In nearly 30% of these accidents, managers assigned unqualiﬁed worker to do
special work, which required workers to attend special training and get a
certiﬁcate.
(9)
Unqualiﬁed to do some special work
There were 3 managers who were not qualiﬁed to be mangers of a project. And,
11 workers did work without necessary qualiﬁcation. Lack of knowledge on
their work lead to falling accidents directly or indirectly.
(10)
Stay or walk in a dangerous area or in a dangerous manner
Workers sometimes stayed or walked in dangerous areas to take a short cut or
avoid inconvenience. And, some workers had a unsafe habit to walk which
might be because they did not know the hazard to doing so (Table 7).

(11)
Not promptly stop staff violations
Supervision is a common way to prevent workers’ unsafe behavior. There were
21% of these 56 accidents were caused by not promptly stopping workers
violations. This situation might be because of the knowledge, attitude or
awareness of the supervisors.
(12)
Defects on safety inspection and acceptance
Safety inspection and acceptance was required after some construction process
was ﬁnished. Contributory factors that safety inspections were not carried out or
there were ﬂaws in safety inspection and acceptance occurred in 21% of the
accidents.
(13)
Without qualiﬁed safety protection facilities
Safety facilities, such as safety fence should be used while working in a high
place. However, 21% of these 56 accidents had causal factors relating to inad-
equate safety protection facilities. And, 2/3 of these unsafe acts were conducted
by managers, and 1/3 were conducted by workers.
(14)
Illegal subcontracting
Illegal subcontracting meant asking organizations that are not eligible to do
some work to do the project. This unsafe act was decision from managers. Illegal
subcontracting contributed to 16% of the accidents.
(15)
Ask workers work with hazards
Normally, workers followed instructions from their managers. However, there
were 14% of the accidents led by violations of asking workers to work with
hazards.
(16)
Fail to encourage workers to follow safety rules and regulations
There is a responsibility for managers to encourage workers to follow the safety
rules and regulations. However, some managers in these accidents did not do
anything on it in their normal work. This unsafe act of managers led to 9% of the
accidents.
(17)
Illegal start of construction project
Some projects started without of a permission from the government. These
projects usually did not fulﬁll requirements on safety.
(18)
Use equipment with hazards
Sometimes, workers did not check the situation of the equipment. And, some
workers might keep on using equipment with hazards because of low safety
conscious.

Drink before work
There was one accident caused by a worker who drank alcohol before work,
which is strictly forbidden. Workers deﬁnitely know the risk of drinking before
work, however, there are still someone did it. It may require more education and
supervision on it.

Conclusions
Unsafe acts contributing to falling accidents were discussed by analyzing 56 accidents
using 2–4 model. Both unsafe acts caused by managers and workers were studied and
classiﬁed. The results could beneﬁt the design of falling accident preventing measures.
More causes from systematic view could be studied in future work to work out more
suggestions on preventing falls in construction industry.

Abstract. In the international context, the issue of Occupational Safety and
Health (OSH) in the Civil Construction sector is still a problem related to a lack
of safety culture, lack of resources and means, short implementation times, lack
of eﬀective supervision, the lack of basic or sectoral training of some actors in
this industry, among other causes. Construction accidents cause many human
tragedies, discourage workers, interrupt the construction process, adversely aﬀect
the costs, productivity and reputation of this industry and slow down the progress
of society (Integrating Safety and Health Performance into Construction, 1997).
Portugal is one of the countries of the European Union that has one of the highest
labor loss rates, with a higher incidence in the Civil Construction sector. The
importance of this sector to the Portuguese economy is very well known, since it
is a direct source of employment of workers. Its activity moves several sectors,
upstream and downstream of its production chain, which is why it is considered
one of the driving forces of the national economy, not only because of its speciﬁc
weight in wealth creation but also in employment, taking into account the Its
obvious multiplier eﬀect, and is therefore a fundamental activity for the growth
of the economy. This is a sector with a low-skilled workforce, presenting a great
precariousness and job instability, oﬀering low salaries and demanding high
levels of income. It is also characterized by a large and constant displacement of
personnel from site to site, who are also required a frequent change of place and
job within each work. It also requires a great deal of versatility on the part of
workers in that it has a huge diversity of activities and professions. Therefore it
is urgent to change this paradigm, in favor of occupational safety and prevention.

Introduction
Construction has a set of very speciﬁc and unique characteristics, which are associated
with a strong precariousness and labor turnover, plus the general practice of

subcontracting. These peculiarities give it a unique character among the diﬀerent sectors
of economic activity and transform it into one of the ones that present a higher accident
rate, especially with regard to fatal accidents. For this reason it deserves careful
attention [1].
It is recalled that in the construction industry, the construction process does not take
place around the machine, as a static logic of factory scope, but rather as a function of
the dynamics of the project that is carried out. It follows that prevention must be devel‐
oped according to its own methodologies that accompany the dynamics and particular‐
ities of projects and construction processes [2].
The performance of OSH should be a priority of all corporate hierarchies, as well as
in the framing, planning and execution of works, ultimately reaching the workers, also
responsible for their self-control as regards their prevention as key players in the process
productive activity of the construction industry, which due to the activities they carry
out are exposed to several speciﬁc high risks of this sector.
It will be important to analyze the level of basic training (level of education) and
level of training in OSH.
These elements are fundamental throughout the organizational structure. Given that
they are the link between Safety Technicians and workers, and can become the largest
agent in promoting and implementing prevention in companies/works.
Identify the role of Intermediate Managers in the organics of the organizations, using
several management tools that will allow planning, organizing and controlling the results
of the Team, always focusing on the productive area and OSH [6].
Investing in the training of intermediate managers will, in the short and medium
term, result in productive gains, reduction of accident rates, improvement of corporate
image, valuation of “life”, reduction of income or work stoppages due to accidents [1].
In short, all direct and indirect costs associated with the incident/accident at work.
It is important to gauge the impact of team leadership on the reduction of accident rates,
the way in which its leadership is carried out, the relationship with training and profes‐
sional experience.
Given the great mobility and turnover of workers, it can be seen on the ground that
most of the operational workers “only” have OSH training, when they start an activity
or a work, in fact “only” a meeting, often of little time, where the risks associated with
the tasks to be performed are transmitted [2].
Also, in order to understand the opinion of the workers in the sector regarding health
and safety issues in their workplace, and the aspects they would like to see improved,
416 workers’ surveys and 109 companies were administered in the sector, and through
from its analysis it was possible to make some considerations about this theme.

Materials and Methods
The central objectives of the present study were to try to perceive, through the workers,
opinions, the extent to which the two contracts that served as a sample show a concern
with health and safety issues and to what extent they provide training/information
sessions to all its workers.
Inﬂuence of Training in Occupational Safety and Health

This work had a methodological basis based on three fundamental bibliographical
research components:
Scientiﬁc component - Consultation and analysis of several articles and scientiﬁc
papers with peer review, as basis for framing and orientation of the theme and proposed
objectives.
Legal component - Support and support in various legal and normative documents,
both historical and current, in order to support the development of this work in the
guidelines issued by the bodies that supervise and supervise the law and working
conditions, both at the national level (ACT; ASAE; DGS; among others), either inter‐
national (OIT; AESST; AISS; among others).
Technical component - Research and study of several statistical models, of treatment
and data analysis.
The bibliographic research components were complemented with a statistical anal‐
ysis of the behavior of the work accident in Construction that met the requirements
identiﬁed as factors common to several organizations.
For this purpose, a data survey was carried out, with the latter as a base instrument
for two questionnaires, which were submitted to a pre-test. The data were treated for
statistical purposes in the present research work.
The questionnaires carried out in a real context of execution of two works (Figs. 1
and 2), that moved several sectors, upstream and downstream of its production chain.
In both situations, the questionnaires were applied to a sample of 109 companies and
416 workers, in a total universe of 134 companies and 852 workers who participated in
the entire production process.

Notwithstanding the insistence, the sample resulted from the kindness and cooper‐
ation of the respondents who agreed to participate in the study.
The questionnaire was applied to the companies based on the following requirements:
• Companies with economic activity in the ﬁeld of Civil Construction and Public
Works, with diﬀerent dimensions (staﬀ, annual turnover, qualiﬁcation, safety and
medical services at work, investment in OSH and training provided to workers in
OSH), within the period under study;
• Existence of accident records within the study period.
The application of the questionnaire to the workers was carried out based on the
following requirements:
• Collection of personal data of the worker (professional category, age, gender, nation‐
ality, schooling);
• Collection of professional data of the worker (possessing CAP for the professional
activity, professional situation, time practiced, time of activity in the company, time
of experience in the current function, time of experience in the construction sector,
family background in construction and data On OSH training) within the study
period;
• Collection of information indicating how the accident occurred, the circumstances
in which it occurred, and how the injuries occurred (the event is divided into three
sequences: speciﬁc physical activity, deviation, contact - mode of injury, and agents
associated materials) within the study period;
• Collection of information regarding the nature and severity of the injuries and conse‐
quences of the accident (part of the injured body, type of injury and number of days
lost) within the study period.
The reference period is deﬁned between January 2013 and December 2014, and may
in some cases be broader and/or shorter due to the data provided by the entities.
The sectoral scope refers to the activities of section and subsection F of the CAE
Revision 3, namely in the Civil Construction and Public Works sector, which covers
companies with a geographical location in the national territory (continental Portugal).
Thus, the questionnaire covered the sample selected, with the necessary guarantees
of conﬁdentiality of the data collected, with the intention of minimizing any deviation
from the results.
The questionnaires were a research instrument consisting of a set of written ques‐
tions, with objective knowledge of the views, interests and situations lived.
The questionnaires were applied through the personal interview method, guaran‐
teeing the anonymity of the interviewees. Responses have been treated conﬁdentially
and will only present general results of the study, without any information that could
lead to the speciﬁc identiﬁcation of the participant.

Results and Discussion
A data collection was carried out, based on two questionnaires, carried out in a real
context of execution of two works, that moved several sectors, upstream and downstream
of its production chain. In both situations, the questionnaires were applied to a sample
of 109 companies and 416 workers, in a total universe of 134 companies and 852 workers
who participated in the entire production process.
All of the following data are the result of an investigation of a sample of 416 workers
and 109 companies that participated in the entire production process, in the execution
of two public works that have operated in various sectors upstream and downstream of
their production chain during the period of analysis of this research study (2013–2014).
Regarding the number of hours of OSH training, it was veriﬁed that, except for
occasional cases of technicians attending a TSST and/or recycling course in both years
of study, the only contact with training in the area was given in sections on-site. On the
ground, it can be seen that the workers of temporary work companies are more at risk.
It is observed that about 94% of workers had up to 4 h of OSH training (Tables 1 and 2).

A natural and obvious situation results in the idea that all workers feel a need for
more OSH training. In the ﬁeld, they say that given the technological evolution, of
materials and constructive solutions, it is essential to know the inherent risks, as well as
the knowledge of preventive measures (Tables 3 and 4).

Despite the range of values mentioned in the survey, on the ground it is clear that
investment in OSH, not only in training, but especially in local conditions, including
collective protection, is small. Many workers have IPE’s unused “but they use it because
they have it”.
In the analysis of the number of hours of training per worker, it is observed that
around 4 to 5% of companies comply with the stipulated in the Labor Code [5]. They
minister at least 35 h per worker (Table 5).

As a result of the statistical treatment, the following data were veriﬁed:
• The intermediate classes have the most training, namely 30 to 34 years and 40 to 44
years. It is also veriﬁed that the classes with more than 50 years are the ones that
present less frequency of formation in OSH which, related to the one mentioned in
the previous point, can indicate that the collaborators with less formation in OSH
could be more exposed to the occurrence of accidents.

• If we associate ‘Time of Professional Experience in the Construction Sector’ and
‘OSH training’, it is veriﬁed that there is a greater discrepancy of employees with
and without training in the older classes. This means that although there is still a
marked shortage of OSH training for all employees, there is a considerable diﬀerence
in the older classes between those who did not have training and those who did.
• After analyzing the intersection between ‘Company investment value in OSH’ and
‘Sinistrality Indices’, it is veriﬁed that the ‘Sinistrality Indices’ is lower where there
is a higher value of the company’s investment in OSH.

Conclusion
It was found that instruments for an overall policy on occupational safety and health
were designed to meet the need to promote the approximation of european standards on
accidents at work and occupational diseases and also to achieve the overall objective of
constant reduction and consolidated labor accident rates, also contributing to a progres‐
sive and continuous improvement of health and well-being levels at work [4].
To achieve these objectives, it is essential to introduce a culture of prevention, to
facilitate the consultation and active participation of workers in the process of improving
work organization, to adopt measures aimed at improving well-being at work, with a
view to adapting work to man and their compatibility with family life, introduce factors
of control and development of workers’ physical and mental health and promote health
surveillance.
The study shows that the vast majority of workers do not have training in OSH. They
only have in many cases only the training of reception on the job.
From the data collected in the surveys, it should be noted that the total number of
workers in the sample who reported OSH training provided was insuﬃcient.
Thus, there is no training that allows, for example, to make a correct disclosure of
hazard identiﬁcation and risk assessment, as well as the technical procedures and
instructions for their control (deﬁned as regards general OSH, and nowadays increas‐
ingly hands companies with SGSST implemented), the probability of failure due to lack
of knowledge is greatly increased.
As shown by the data, there is a higher prevalence of OSH training in employees
with less seniority, and is even more important, in the technical staﬀ. However, when
inserted in work environments where the majority of employees have performed the
tasks for a longer time, but only based on their common sense and the experience of the
function, employees with less seniority end up also adopting as their work practices the
Who look at those who have been in the role for some time [1].
For the treatment of data, it is veriﬁed that the employees who have been in the
position for more years have fewer literary qualiﬁcations and less training in OSH and,
consequently, a greater number of occupational accidents. This reﬂects, according to
the individual factors referred to by the HSE (1999), the importance that the school
qualiﬁcations and levels of acquired competences possess with respect to the labor acci‐
dents [2].

One of the relevant situations, veriﬁed on the ground, is related to temporary work
agencies. The precariousness, lack of information/training, often associated with the
“subjections” that workers are exposed to, are a motive for reversing the recorded trends
of declines in non-mortal and mortal labor accidents.
The most relevant explanatory variable in the explanation of the accident rates (Inci‐
dence and Severity) is the unemployment rate. Viewed in isolation from each other, but
together with the variable unemployment rate, the variables participation rate in training
actions and training costs per worker are also important, as evidenced by statistical
reliability. Interestingly, these two variables act in the opposite direction, that is, an
increase in the participation rate in training actions leads to an increase in the two acci‐
dent rates, and an increase in training costs per worker leads to an increase in Index of
severity.
These facts do not mean that the investment in Prevention and OSH should not be
done. What it translates is that, as it is done, not only does it not lead to expected results,
but even leads them to the opposite direction, to what would be intended. Companies
(and the State) should rethink the type of training given to their workers and realize that
the exponential increase in spending in recent years has not led to remarkable results.
In economic terms, over the period 2013–2014, what the average company spends
per year in Prevention and OSH is more than what it saves with the possible decrease
in work accidents, which only reinforces the conclusion of ineﬃciency of investment in
Prevention and OSH.
It is veriﬁed that until 2013 there was a reduction of the average hours of training
per participant, being the end of that year of 32.8 h.
Due to the results obtained, it is urgently necessary to place a question: what is so
poor about the Prevention and Security in the Construction sector, in the face of such
huge investments, which are often called for by successive Legislation in order to make
it more demanding?
The easiest, and most dangerous, conclusion (because it becomes demagogic and
reductive) would be: investment in Prevention and OSH does not pay oﬀ. This conclu‐
sion would not go to the root of the causes, nor would it even throw clues. And as the
purpose of any research work, when, when answering certain questions, others arise, it
will be necessary to try to outline new hypotheses of investigation and not to draw
conclusions early. Because a more serious hypothesis is to say that investment, as it is
done at the moment, is not compensatory. That is, it is not concerned what is spent on
Prevention and OSH, but how it is spent or declared to be spent.
These results are highly worrisome and once again allow us to strongly question the
objectives and quality of the training provided in companies, as well as the legal model
that is deﬁned in this area. It is once again proven that training is not enough, but the
most fundamental is its adequacy to the reality of each company, with the risk here
proven of the complete lack of return on investment made under these conditions.
It is also important to emphasize that, at the level of the training evaluation, it would
be important to have an assessment that would allow the identiﬁcation of the learning
transfers eﬀectively obtained, both for the individual and for the organization [4].

Abstract. While remarkable progress has been made recently to improve the
state of occupational safety, the number of occupational accidents is still unac‐
ceptable. In addition, the organizational costs related to these safety problems in
the workplace are staggering. Therefore, eﬀective strategies are needed to guide
the continuous improvement of safety performance. Common approaches include
setting safety goals, identifying the key activities/interventions to reach those
goals, and evaluating performance. The most challenging and fundamental issue
within these approaches is evaluating safety performance. While it has been a
focus of safety professionals, concerns still exist among researchers with regard
to how safety performance can be appropriately and accurately measured to
improve decision support systems. Recently, researchers in the ﬁeld of safety have
begun directing eﬀorts towards new approaches for measuring safety perform‐
ance by addressing leading indicators. However, because of its nature and utility,
the ideas and concepts of leading indicators have remained unclear. In an eﬀort
to overcome this challenge, this study attempts to distinguish between the two
common aspects of safety performance, observable activities and outcomes. The
importance of using leading indicators for steering safety performance is then
highlighted. In order to meet these objectives, the results chain model, which has
been introduced by several researchers for outlining the program development,
is employed. The elements of the results chain model are then interrelated with
relevant safety concepts. As a result, the relationship between the leading and
lagging indicators and safety performance is identiﬁed. A set of leading indicators
that predict safety performance is proposed. Further, the important implications
of this study for both academic communities and practitioners are discussed as
well.

Introduction
The vision stated by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
highlights the importance of healthier and safer workers’ role in promoting productivity
in the workplace [1]. This vision is addressed in literature where several researchers
discuss the advantages of safer and healthier workplaces including more productive
workforce, improved ﬁnancial performance, and lower healthcare costs [2, 3]. In
contrast to the advantages of following Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) princi‐
ples, signiﬁcant problems can occur as a result of ignoring those rules. For example,
nearly 6,000 deaths and approximately four million work-related injuries and illnesses
are reported each year in the United States [4]. These problems aﬀect both the employers
and employees. While the organizational cost relative to poor safety at work is incurring,
employees’ families are also indirectly suﬀering from overlooking OHS principles in
the workplace. Annual costs of more than $53 billion for workers’ compensation have
been reported by the United States Department of Labor [5]. Therefore, addressing OHS
concerns can be a signiﬁcant step in a companies’ attempt to aﬀect not only the compa‐
nies’ performance but also society.
Further, due to rapid changes in technology, new hazards have been brought in to
the workplace. Subsequently, safety professionals should modify approaches to measure
safety performance more appropriately; even though remarkable progress has been made
to improve the state of occupational safety in the workplaces compared to the past. For
instance, the number of deaths in 1912 (21,000) dropped to 5,000 in 2014 [4]. Despite
this striking progress, there is still a need for establishing new strategies to control and
reduce workplace risks. As an example, NIOSH recently launched the Total Worker
Health (TWH) program to sustain and improve workers’ health and safety in the work‐
place. Creating a safer and healthier workplace through establishing policies and
programs is beneﬁcial for individuals, families, and employers and their organizations,
which further leads to productive communities. Although considerable studies have been
conducted on the various aspects of safety and health in the workplace, less attention
has been devoted to proposing a method for planning, predicting, and measuring OHS
performance in an integrated and systematic way. For instance, how the antecedents of
safety performance are related to safety activities and their ﬁnal outcomes is still contro‐
versial among scholars [4]. A comprehensive conceptual framework for illustrating the
possible relationships among safety concepts is clearly needed.
Further, considering preventive activities in safety can result in high return on
investment. As an illustration, the American Society of Safety Engineers shows that
companies which spend $1 on preventive activities in connection with workplace safety
can lead to at least $3 saved. According to this fact, again, the importance of planning
and predicting OHS performance is shown. Luckily, nowadays, safety programs have
been directed to upstream safety eﬀorts compared to the downstream approach in the
past. Nevertheless, illustrating both upstream and downstream safety concepts in a
conceptual framework is lacking.
The present study attempts to clearly and systematically illustrate the relationships
among safety concepts in a comprehensive framework. To this end, a review of the
literature addressing OHS indicators has been performed. Future studies can beneﬁt from
196

the proposed framework to develop speciﬁc and more consistent methods for measuring
OHS performance in diﬀerent operational contexts and according to diﬀerent priorities.
The rest of the paper includes the diﬀerent approaches of safety performance meas‐
urement in the next section, then, the introduction of the results chain model is provided,
next, the linkage of safety concepts to the result chain model’s elements will be provided.
After that, Sect. 5 shows the upstream safety’s concepts involving leading indicators
and, lastly, implications of the study and conclusions are presented.

Measurement of Safety Performance
The foundation of a business management process includes measuring and controlling
the performance. The gap between an acceptable level and current level of performance
is identiﬁed by measurement [6]. Safety professionals are expected to establish similar
approaches for managing safety activities and identifying appropriate interventions to
create a safer workplace. In order to continuously improve the safety performance of a
workplace, certain strategies are commonly employed such as goal setting, identiﬁcation
of the key activities/interventions to reach those goals, and performance evaluation. The
most challenging and fundamental issue among these strategies is the evaluation of
safety performance. Two common views exist regarding safety performance. The old
view refers to blaming individuals for human errors and at-risk behaviors. By addressing
this view, only humans were typically identiﬁed as the causes of accidents and injuries.
As a result, the underlying indicators for measuring the safety performance within the
old view included the number of accidents and injuries. Human error does not address
the inﬂuencing elements behind an individual’s activities or decisions. Therefore, the
reasons, or root causes, that led to accidents and injuries remained unclear. After two
catastrophic accidents, Chernobyl and Bhopal, researchers were warned that other
elements also attributed to accidents in the workplace [7]. This limited view is not
appropriate today; therefore, a new view is required.
The new view believes that human error is a symptom and not a direct cause of
accidents. It focuses on root causes of accidents such as organizational factors, task
characteristics, and working environment. Compared to the traditional approach, which
failed to point out the direct factors inﬂuencing accidents and injuries in the workplace,
the current holistic view provides a strong rationale for recognizing and controlling the
causes of accidents. This approach can help organizations prevent accidents from reoc‐
curring. Diﬀerent tools and techniques to measure safety performance have been devel‐
oped using the new view compared to the traditional approaches. The common indica‐
tors, which are used to measure safety performance, are known as leading indicators.
These indicators address the underlying elements that had been overlooked under the
auspices of human errors. For example, researchers have recently addressed the elements
of safety culture, management commitment, personality, and work design as they relate
to accidents and injuries in the workplace [8, 9]. Although new methods of measuring
safety performance have been introduced by researchers, clear deﬁnitions of these
concepts still require additional research. Further, experimental studies are needed to
test and verify the advent of new concepts within the occupational safety context.

Result Chain Model
As previously mentioned, new tools and techniques have been developed with respect
to safety performance measurement under the new view. To further the new view, clear
deﬁnitions of safety-related terms should also be developed. This is the main objective
of the present study. This research attempts to introduce the results chain model and its
application to illustrate these safety terms more eﬀectively.
In order to evaluate the impact of a program, the theory of change was developed by
policy makers [10]. The simplest and clearest model to outline the theory of change is
the results chain model, which sets out a sequence of inputs, activities, and outputs to
illustrate how various elements lead to the ﬁnal outcomes of a program [10]. The beneﬁts
of using this model are its ability to illustrate the theory of change, measure eﬀectiveness,
and develop a framework for cross-site learning. The results chain model provides a
framework for analyzing the short-, medium-, and long-term results of a program.
Figure 1 illustrates the structure of this model and the ﬁve underlying components, which
include inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes, and ﬁnal outcomes. The results chain model
is employed in four main situations. First, it helps to signify assumptions about how
various strategies can lead to desired results. Second, it provides a framework for
designing a monitoring plan. Next, through the monitoring plan it is possible to analyze
and adapt the plan according to the deﬁned goals and organizational demands. Finally,
the results chain model can be used for external evaluations.
Fig. 1. The results chain model [10]
Descriptions of the elements within the results chain model are as follows:
Inputs: Resources at the disposal of the program.
Activities: Actions taken to convert inputs into outputs.
Outputs: Tangible results produced by activities.
Outcomes: Changes (usually short to medium time range) resulting from activities
and outputs.
Final outcomes: Final goal(s) of a program (typically achieved over a longer period
of time).
This model has been used in diverse contexts. For instance, the World Health
Organization (WHO) stated that the results chain model is the main method they
employ to assess their programs’ performance [11]. In addition, researchers have
utilized the results chain model to evaluate the holistic impact of a program or
policy. For example, Jahanmehr et al. [12] proposed a conceptual framework using
the results chain model to evaluate public health system performance in Iran. They
changed the underlying components of the model and used input, process, output, and
outcome as the main sections. In another study, Gertler et al. [10] provided an
example of using the results chain model to evaluate the performance of a new
198
S.S. Mousavi et al.

educational approach. The components of the results chain model in their study
included: inputs (human, financial, and other resources), activities (designing new
curriculum and training teachers), outputs (textbook delivered to the classrooms and
trained teachers), outcomes (improved student performance and textbook usage by
teachers in the classrooms), and final outcomes (improved completion rates and
higher earnings).
The result chain model is based on the objective of a study and can be employed in
diﬀerent contexts. In the next section, safety performance and how its underlying
concepts can be interrelated within the results chain model is discussed.

Interrelating Safety Concepts and the Results Change Model
A holistic framework embodying all safety concepts can help safety professionals
clearly set safety goals, deﬁne indicators, and evaluate safety performance more appro‐
priately. Furthermore, the new view of safety performance measurement requires a
precise deﬁnition of safety concepts including safety activities, leading indicators, and
antecedents of safety performance. Therefore, this research attempts to integrate the
safety concepts into the results chain model by addressing the following perspectives:
1. The importance of the antecedents of safety performance in achieving safety goals.
2. The role of safety activities in achieving safety goals.
3. The position of leading and lagging indicators among safety concepts.
4. The association between a near-miss and an accident.
5. The function of safety behaviors among safety concepts.
In order to present these perspectives, the blocks of the results chain model are
employed. By using this model, a sequence of events is depicted to illustrate the rela‐
tionship among safety concepts from the initial elements and antecedents of safety
performance to the ﬁnal elements, accidents, and injuries.
Based on the deﬁnition of an input within the model, which is in connection to the
resources of the program, an antecedent is an input to safety eﬀorts. This is supported
by Wallace [4], who states, “The people, tools, tasks, and operating environment can all
be treated as inputs or antecedents of safety” [p. 2]. Additional researchers also mention
antecedents of safety performance as any direct or indirect items that inﬂuence safety
performance [7, 13]. According to the safety literature, there are four common antece‐
dents for safety performance, which include working environment, task characteristics,
workforce characteristics, and organizational factors [13–16]. Subsequently, these four
elements were utilized as inputs for the proposed model.
Activities within the results chain model are deﬁned as any action taken on the inputs
to produce an output(s). Therefore, safety activities are deﬁned as any undertaken
action(s) in connection with the antecedents of safety performance. A proper indication
of safety performance in the workplace can be determined by the consistency between
safety activities and safety goals. Since early eﬀorts in safety programs are referred to
as safety activities, analyzing and evaluating this element can highlight inconsistencies
between safety activities and safety goals in an organization. Therefore, in order to
Towards a Framework for Steering Safety Performance
199

measure the status of safety activities, OHS leading indicators have been introduced in
the literature. In several studies, the term of activities indicators is used interchangeably
with leading indicators [4, 17]. For example, safety activities extracted from literature
include training, risk assessment, job safety analysis, accident investigation, written
information about OHS procedures, personal protective equipment, budget for OHS,
and involvement of workers in setting OHS policies [18–20].
The next element in the results chain model is the output(s), which is described as
the tangible results produced by activities. For safety, outputs are consistent with the
deﬁnition of safety behaviors. Safety behaviors are the observable activities that are
generated by employees [4] therefore, they are classiﬁed into two categories, safety
participation and safety compliance. Safety participation refers to the participation of
employees in voluntary safety activities [21], such as participation in safety meetings to
address safety concerns and improving OHS programs in the organization. Alterna‐
tively, safety compliance refers to following the OHS rules in the organization [22],
such as using personal protective equipment and following OHS procedures. Therefore,
safety behaviors are the outputs of activities that were undertaken on the antecedents of
safety.
The next element in the results chain model is outcome(s), which are short-term or
medium changes that are a result of outputs and activities. A near-miss is an unplanned
incident with short-term results that does not result in an accident or injury [23]. Since
this deﬁnition is consistent with the outcome’s deﬁnition in the results chain model,
near-miss is placed as the outcome in the proposed model. Further, a near-miss can be
a transitional indicator between safety behaviors and accidents. While near-misses are
deﬁned as an outcome for safety eﬀorts, they can also provide invaluable information
for preventing future accidents. Near-misses are short-term results of safety programs
despite the existing potential to become accidents or injuries since they can provide a
signiﬁcant alert for safety professionals. By investigating near-misses, root causes are
identiﬁed and preventive action plans can be implemented.
The last element in the results chain model is the ﬁnal outcome(s). This item
addresses the ﬁnal goals of a program. Accident and injury reduction is the ﬁnal goal of
safety eﬀorts in an organization. Moreover, due to the long-term impact of accidents,
injuries, and occupational disease for both the individual and organization compared to
the near-misses, these can be placed in the model as ﬁnal outcomes. It is worth noting
that a clear distinction between accidents and injuries is provided by [4], “Traditionally,
accidents and injuries have been lumped together, yet accidents can happen in which no
injury occurs such as in an instance of damage to a piece of equipment” [p. 3]. Therefore,
measuring these ﬁnal outcomes through lagging indicators reveals the impact of safety
interventions. This information is useful for management as it provides managers with
details about the overall status of the safety and health programs in the organization.
The ﬁnal outcomes can also be used as benchmarking measures.
Based on these deﬁnitions, a results chain model with related safety concepts was
developed. Figure 2 provides the proposed model for illustrating safety concepts.

OHS Leading Indicators
In this section, two additional deﬁnitions for leading and lagging indicators within the
OHS context are described. Selecting the appropriate performance indicators is a critical
step in safety and health program evaluation. After setting safety goals, the indicators
are used to assess how consistent the activities and interventions are with safety goals.
A clearly articulated framework for safety concepts provides a useful map for selecting
the underlying OHS indicators along the results chain. In order to eﬀectively monitor
safety performance, two kinds of indicators are necessary: one indicator for monitoring
the safety eﬀorts and the other indicator for evaluating the results of safety eﬀorts.
Table 1. Leading indicators linked to the antecedents of safety performance
Antecedents of safety performance
Leading indicators
Working environment
Assessment of working environment’s hazards, correct
tools and equipment, inspection of tools and equipment
periodically, health facilities (e.g., toilet, showers), near-
miss investigation, benchmarking, and audits
Workforce
Number of employees trained on OHS principles, OHS
brochures/literature, verbal instructions on OHS,
personal protective equipment, and training
Task
Job safety analyses, written information on OHS
procedures, written information about safe working, and
consideration of ergonomic factors
Organizational factors
Management commitment to OHS policies, safety
culture, people’s involvement in articulating OHS issues,
OHS budget, OHS scheduling, reward system for
correcting OHS issue, management walk throughs, and
contractor management
According to this criterion, two types of OHS indicators already exist, which include
leading and lagging indicators. Lagging indicators measure ﬁnal outcomes of activities
or events [24], and, therefore, are often referred to as after-the-fact indicators [25].
Lagging indicators were placed in the proposed model to measure the ﬁnal outcomes
such as accidents, injuries, and occupational diseases. Traditionally, recordable injury
rate, days away, and restricted work have been introduced as lagging indicators, which
are also consistent with the elements of the proposed model.
Towards a Framework for Steering Safety Performance

Leading indicators are known as the activities indicators, which help an organization
take action(s) to lower risk(s) [24]. In addition, according to Step Change in Safety [26],
leading indicators in safety are “something that provides information that helps the user
respond to changing circumstances and take actions to achieve desired outcomes or
avoid unwanted outcomes” [p. 3]. These statements are pertinent to the activities under‐
taken within safety programs. Therefore, the following deﬁnition for leading indicators
is proposed: something that provides information about undertaken activities on the
antecedents of safety performance. Table 1 provides the underlying leading indicators
that were extracted from relevant safety literature [18–20, 23, 24, 27–30].

Implications of Findings and Conclusions
The proposed model has critical implications for both the academic community and
practitioners. The sequence of safety concepts provides a holistic framework, which
enables researchers and practitioners to understand the causal logic behind safety events.
This framework can facilitate discussions on monitoring and evaluating safety eﬀorts
by showing what needs to be monitored and evaluated. Leading indicators can be used
to monitor safety eﬀorts and lagging indicators can be used to evaluate safety programs
[24], as illustrated in the proposed model. Leading indicators measure the safety activ‐
ities and lagging indicators measure the ﬁnal outcomes. Moreover, measuring safety
activities is a self-assessment of safety performance at lower levels of an organization
as opposed to lagging indicators that are used at managerial levels. By conducting self-
assessments, organizations can determine how consistent their safety activities are with
their safety goals. Then, corrective action(s) can provide continuous improvement for
safety eﬀorts. On the other hand, through measuring ﬁnal outcomes with lagging indi‐
cators, the overall evaluation of a safety program is possible, which enables management
to make decisions regarding the organization’s OHS policy.
Measuring safety activities is eﬀective for predicting future safety performance;
however, predicting the outcomes itself is not necessarily possible. In other words, safety
activities indicate only how eﬀectively the safety programs are conducted. Additionally,
measuring safety activities can be used to motivate and direct employees towards safe
behaviors.
A combination of both leading and lagging indicators is recommended to determine
appropriate safety program interventions. While leading indicators depict the safety-
related activities and how well they meet safety goals, lagging indicators provide an
indication of the eﬃciency of safety program interventions. The proposed framework
integrates common safety concepts in a simple, comprehensive structure for future rele‐
vant studies.
Since safety has been deﬁned as a process rather than an event [17], the entire safety
process from the initial steps (inputs) to ending steps (ﬁnal outcomes) must be consid‐
ered. The proposed model maps the necessary steps to enable practitioners to monitor
safety eﬀorts by measuring safety activities and evaluating safety programs through the
ﬁnal outcomes.

here, applications in space operations simulation and rehabilitation medicine, in
particular, are presented. This paper aims to bring to the scientiﬁc community
knowledge about this recently developed virtual reality technology in order to
motivate cooperation, development, and application of this facility.

Introduction
In the last few decades, systems based on virtual reality (VR) have started to play a
signiﬁcant role in both research and industrial applications. These systems enable
investigations in research areas related to medical, space, and human factors, and in the
training of industrial operators. In the most recent years, they have also started to be
used in the gaming, entertainment, and educational industry [1].
As far as space research applications are concerned, for long-duration crewed
missions to Mars, human space mission simulators using VR play an important role in
the development and testing of hardware and software technologies. Simulators also
provide a viable platform for conducting research in space, e.g. in the areas of psy-
chology, physiology, medicine, mission operations, human factors, and habitability.

These research areas are critical for ensuring the well-being of the crew and enhancing
performance in long-term space missions.
In this context, Mars Planet (former the Italian Mars Society) has developed a new
VR facility for testing and developing space technologies and medical applications
named Motigravity (Fig. 3). This facility allows:
• Immersive visual scenarios
• Reduction of weight to emulate varying degrees of surface acceleration
• Mobility/locomotion on a treadmill
• Real-time connection with other users in virtual reality
• Virtual interaction with immersive visual and audio environments using the Oculus
Rift technology
• Tracking of user movements inside a 3D virtual environment and reproduction of
these movements by an avatar.
2
Structure of Motigravity
Motigravity can be customized like a general VR-based tool included in all the ground
system simulation architectures for which systems are foreseen both for the purpose of
astronaut training and mission control operations. The basic structure of the device is
composed of different parts:
• Hypogravity lifting system: A mechanical frame connected with a treadmill base
and a user lifting system, which includes different kinds of lifting and harness
systems consisting of both hardware and sensors to enable simulation of users’
movement in low gravity, including walking or interacting with the environment.
• Treadmill base: A round, concave platform used to allow movement of the lower
body part. In this project, it is also connected with virtual sensorial interaction of the
upper part of the body.

• VR/AR software system: A speciﬁc software control system including the VR/AR
applications necessary for simulating the experience has been developed by Mars
Planed ad hoc.
• VR/AR devices system: A system composed of both VR devices like Oculus rift
and artiﬁcial reality (AR) systems like Hololens, which can be used alternatively to
test the tool both in VR and AR environments.
• Optional devices: The system is adaptable to allow interaction with extra equip-
ment such as space suits, medical devices, health monitoring systems, as well as a
lower-body hypogravity simulator. This last device consists of a plastic bag cylinder
into which pressurized air is injected and into which the lower part of the astro-
naut’s body is inserted. This device helps to reduce the gravity experienced by the
user and can also be used as a tool for rehabilitation exercises. The device is
optional and can be added when needed.
The overall architecture of the Motigravity tool is coordinated by a central control
system able to process the external data in real time (Fig. 1).

Example of a Tested Space Application
In particular, this VR system has been developed on the basis of the lessons learned
from the use of previous versions (Fig. 2) in various tests and experimental applica-
tions such as a study on safety and training for Space applications [1, 2]. We describe
one example of utilization of the Motigravity system in the framework of the
AMADEE-15 Mars simulation [3]. During the simulation in August 2015, a set of pilot
tests were conducted during a 12-day emulated operational Mars exploration simula-
tion at the Kaunertal Glacier in Austria. Eleven experiments were conducted by a
carefully selected and trained ﬁeld crew at the test site, coordinated by a Mission
Support Center in Innsbruck, Austria.
The research ﬁelds covered by the experiments encompassed geology, human
factors, astrobiology, robotics, tele-science, exploration, and operations research.
A Remote Science Support team analyzed the ﬁeld data in near-real time, providing
planning input for a ﬂight control team to manage a complex system of ﬁeld assets in a
realistic workﬂow, including advanced Space suit simulators as well as robotic and
aerial vehicles. A 10-minute satellite communication delay and other limitations per-
tinent to human planetary surface activities were introduced. A previous analysis of
historical missions, like the EVAs during the Apollo lunar missions, revealed a sig-
niﬁcant deviation between planned versus actual traverses, leading to delays in the
ﬂight plan [4]. Hence, predictive tools can be a key factor for the success of the mission
and in the case of Motigravity, this means that the tool can be used to allow better
prediction capabilities [5]. In the course of the “Virtualization Experiment for Mars
Expedition Simulations “(VEMES) pilot experiment, two Motivity stations (the
treadmill developed by Italian Marsefore Motigravity) were deployed at the ﬁeld test
site at a glacier base station at 2700 m, while two simpler versions were set up at the
Mission Support Center. By using the vertical treadmill with the gravity-ofﬂoading
climbing harness together with the exoskeleton of the AOuda.X spacesuit simulator,
the movements of the astronaut were recorded with a Microsoft Kinect, which trans-
lated the movements into a virtual world based upon a Blender software model. Head
movements were measured via the head-mounted display. The physical test site was
imaged from a 6-propeller drone carrying a digital camera. Point clouds and a 3D mesh
were created from the images, and the textures subsequently applied to the mesh,
resulting in a high-resolution 3D model.
Three males with a mean age of 30.3 ± 5.5 years participated in 11 virtual EVAs;
all of them were fully trained and certiﬁed analog astronauts [5]. Their subjective
assessment was based upon a structured questionnaire which allowed ratings from 1
(inadequate) to 5 (excellent), (Fig. 4). The representativeness of the virtual EVA vs. the
actual physical one was rated as 4, its effectiveness for familiarizing oneself for future
EVA was 5, although the adequacy for identifying hazardous areas was only 3.6, which
was attributed to the resolution of the DEM [5].
Using digital elevation model data and high-resolution aerial photography, ﬂight
planners were able to virtually “pre-enact” the locomotion of the analog astronauts,
which would then execute the actual traverses, qualitatively estimating the workload
and effort needed for the respective extravehicular activities: Once the EVA traverses
210
A. Del Mastro et al.

had been ﬁnalized by the ﬂight plan teams, the Sat-DEM and photogrammetry terrains
of the corresponding future EVA sites were used for IVR simulation of upcoming
EVAs. Three OeWF analog astronauts participated in 11 virtual EVAs. They entered
the Motigravity station and conducted their future EVA virtually, familiarizing them-
selves with the traverse path, obstacles, optimal routes, and mission-relevant
landmarks.
As a result, the virtual reality system proved itself as a valuable training tool,
although a sufﬁciently high terrain resolution is required to enable the identiﬁcation of
individual rocks for sampling and hazard avoidance (Fig. 5).

Example of a Planned Medical Application
The initial purpose of the Motigravity tool was to help astronauts handle their future
habitat inside an appropriate simulation: Its general design allows weight reduction
reproduction of different gravitational ﬁeld effects on our mass. In association with a
virtual environment, it becomes possible to make a powerful cognitive impact and
enhance the learning process. But the possibility to reduce the weight safely by means
of a virtual interaction highlighted several unexpected potential uses.
Virtual simulations of the real world are used in clinical studies: High realism and
immersion appear to be useful in the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases and
behavioral troubles. This might concern almost 450 million patients all over the world.
According to the World Health Organization, one out of four people has or will develop
a mental disease during their lifetime [6, 7]. Thus, abnormal thinking and trouble with
perception, cognitive impairment, lack of emotions, or behavioral diseases are some of
the areas targeted by this cutting-edge treatment using serious games: The patient is in a
virtual environment like in a habitat and evolves as he would in his daily life. The
objective is to help him face his fears or behavioral problems in order to improve his
real life [8–10]. For example, one scenario could be used to treat claustrophobia: The
patient is taking an elevator. As a ﬁrst step, he goes to the ﬁrst ﬂoor within a few
seconds. He repeats the scene until he is able to go up to the last ﬂoor of a building,
maybe the 40th ﬂoor, with a stop at the 20th. Each scenario could be adapted to treat
any problem. Moreover, various institutions are nowadays trying to ﬁnd innovative
solutions using virtual reality to treat Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease or to improve
stroke rehabilitation [11–14].
Associated with exercises, the general solution becomes interesting for both social
and functional rehabilitation. Effectively, the Motigravity tool per se, as designed,
might have an important impact for post-traumatic injuries or diseases with neuro-
muscular disturbances and degeneration [15, 16]: Placed at the center, the patient will
be able to walk and to repeat the exercise with gradually increasing intensity. Tread-
mills are already in use in research to help treat children with cerebral palsy, which is a
group of permanent movement disorders (coordination problems, stiff and weak
muscles, tremors, etc.) that appear in early childhood; however, there is still some work
to be done to improve the actual systems and results. Motigravity could bring an
innovative solution with the use of virtual reality, where virtual objectives, motivation,
and targeted exercises could be mixed in a ludic protocol [17, 18].
Indeed, this mechanism allows working on locomotion, postural rehabilitation, and
equilibrium as well as on spatial navigation and other disorders through virtual reality
[19, 20]. Besides Space training, this global use for public health could also become a
routine in Space for astronauts’ post-ﬂight rehabilitation and ﬁghting the aging effects
of Space exposure. Spacemedex is currently working on the design of clinical studies
and the transfer of this technology from the aerospace sector to the non-Space medical
ﬁeld. This will involve experts from institutes in neuropsychiatric disease, locomotion,
and aging. The next step would be to integrate haptic control and the grabbing of
virtual elements to simulate reality even better and achieve greater stimulation.

Comparison with Existing VR Treadmills
When Motigravity was designed, other forms of simulating hypogravity [21] and
existing VR treadmills were also analyzed in order to better identify what could be the
added value features of the tool (like the one from NASA Fig. 7). Differently to
the comparison made between the tools for simulating hypogravity, the comparison of
the Motigravity performance with general VR treadmills also helped to target the
possible market for a more general application of the tool in sectors other than those
described in this paper, such as gaming or educational applications.
Below, the main factors and the rates used to analyze the different products are
listed:
1. VR application: scientiﬁc (Space, medical, rehabilitation, …), entertainment
(gaming, sports, …), commercial (promotional, advertising), military, educational
(training, academic), other.
2. VR immersivity level: deﬁned here as the quality of being immersive, based on the
level (0 not present, 1 basic or present, 2 advanced) of interaction involvement on
different sensorial planes such as: motoric (not present, basic tracking e.g. partial
body, advanced tracking e.g. complete body), auditive (not available, basic e.g. PC
audio signal, advanced e.g. headphone or special audio software), visual (not
available, basic e.g. computer monitor, advanced e.g. Oculus Rift), extra features
(not present, present e.g. reduced weight system, hypogravity simulation)
3. Hypogravity simulation: no
4. Harness system user friendly: low (does not allow spontaneous and easy move-
ments), medium (allows partly spontaneous and easy movements), high (completely
allow spontaneous and easy movement)
5. Quality of VR software: real-time response and quality of rendered world and
interaction with the VR environment: not present, basic, medium, advanced.
Fig. 6. Comparison of immersivity levels between different models

213

6. Dimension: the longest dimension between the diameter of the base or the height of
the treadmill: big (>3 m), medium (<3 m and >1.5 m), small (<1.5 m).
7. Price: in $ or €: high (>50,000), medium (<5,000 and >800), low (<800), not
available.
As shown by Fig. 6, we can observe that the majority of the models have a value of
between 3 and 5, while Motigravity distinguishes itself by having an immersivity level
of 6. Indeed, Motigravity has a strong competitive characteristic also, as it is one of the
few instruments that allow experiencing hypogravity with relatively low dimensions
and low costs. The further development of the tool is also expected to increase the
value of its immersivity level parameter.

Test of Performance Quality
The performance of the Motigravity tool has been tested using different conﬁgurations
in order to select the best combination of required memory, CPU, and graphic cards
options, and VR visors such as OCULUS rift and HTC Vive. In particular, selected
metrics already being used as parameters in many applications in the VR sector [22]
have been applied to evaluate the quality of the performance of Motigravity. The list of
foreseen metrics that has been used for the performance evaluation of Motigravity is
reported in the following.
• Timing accuracy: [23] in terms of delay regarding real-time interaction. In par-
ticular for Motigravity, these parameters are essential to be evaluated in the case of
Fig. 7. Argos system by NASA ((c) NASA)
214
A. Del Mastro et al.

Space and medical simulations such as telemedicine, as the performance of the tool
should really simulate the real-time behavior of astronauts and patients.
• Position accuracy: [23] This is intended as the spatial inconsistency between
physical moves and visual feedback, which in the case of Motigravity is essential
for the simulation of astronaut activities and medical studies.
• Visual perception: This is intended as the capability to identify the quality of the
VR visual scenario. In Motigravity, the best distances between objects in the VR
environment have been studied by creating ad-hoc VR test scenarios or changing
the perception due to different frame rates.
• Rendering: In Motigravity, the rendering capability is optimized via appropriate
ray tracing, shading models, optical distortions, and latency reduction algorithms of
the VR software.
• Manipulation: This is the capacity of the user to interact with and change the
environment. To improve the performance of the Motigravity tool during manip-
ulation tasks, the choice has been to focus on some basic activity such as: selecting,
grasping, manipulating, carrying, placing, also applying the “basin of attraction”
principle: an object is truly identiﬁed/attracted/moved by the user when the user
reaches a speciﬁed area (“basin”).
• Audio: The audio performance in Motigravity is improved by means of appropriate
sound ﬁlters and software both for the case of sound arriving in the virtual envi-
ronment from external sources (signals from Space, commands received by patients
during their rehabilitation exercises, etc.) and for sound generated in the virtual
world and transmitted to the real world.

Conclusion and Further Development
Motigravity can be deﬁned as an innovative VR tool for Space and Earth applications
such as Mars mission training, as well as for rehabilitation and telemedicine. In par-
ticular, it is characterized by the possibility to simulate hypogravity as well as the high
level of immersivity, low dimensions, and low costs. This paper has presented some of
these features in order to motivate further development and cooperation in the VR/AR
ﬁeld.
With regard to planned further development applications of the tool, also based on
previous experience like AMADEE-15, the simultaneous use of Motigravity in dif-
ferent locations on Earth is envisioned to investigate the performance of tasks by
astronauts or subjects located in regions with either extreme or standard environmental
conditions like Space and medicine laboratories. This application is a special case of
the overall Mars City project carried out by the Mars Planet organization, which also
includes the reconstruction in VR/AR of entire regions of Mars (V-MARS program).
Under evaluation is also a comparison of the performance using Motigravity and the
experiences made by astronauts during low-gravity ﬂights. In this context, an analysis
is also ongoing regarding what kind of metrics to set up for an appropriate comparison
between the two simulation techniques.

Abstract. This study reexamined data from an earlier study by the U.S. National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health addressing the after-reach speed of
press operators—a speed that is a key part of standards for locating two-hand
actuator buttons from the point of operation. The 60 participating press operators
performed four reaches in each of two button placements. The investigators
reported on the fastest of the four for each operator. They concluded that the 1.6 m/
s value is inadequate to protect many of the faster press operators. For this paper,
all reach speeds were analyzed and used to identify the percentiles of all after-
reaches that were slower than several common percentile.

Introduction
Among the many sources of industrial injures, one is amputations involving operation
of mechanical power presses. Two investigations illustrate the magnitude of this
problem. First, a paper based on U.S. workers’ compensation records estimated over ten
thousand amputation per year involving presses [1]. Second, reports of occupational
amputations submitted to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration
contained 2184 cases; 29% were from presses using two-hand actuators [2].
The use of two-hand actuators on presses is widespread. Suokas reported results of
a survey about mechanical power presses in Finland that found that over 60% used a
two-hand actuation method for actuating the stroke [3]. To set up these kinds of press
operations, the two-hand actuator buttons need to be far enough from the point-of-oper‐
ation to protect an operator who may initiate the downstroke by pressing both buttons,
then suddenly reaching with one hand to adjust a mis-positioned part [4].
A formula for achieving this protection is widely used throughout the world. The
formula is used to compute a “safe distance” between the buttons and the point-of-
operation. The formula computes this “safe distance” by multiplying the time is takes
to remove the hazard of a descending ram by a “hand speed constant” [4]. According to
a review of studies looking for a value to use for the hand speed constant [5], the
commonly used value of 1.6 m/s originated during the 1930 based on a small study of
reach speeds achieved by students participating in the study.

The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) revisited
this “hand speed constant” by constructing a press simulator to use for further studies
[6]. The largest and most representative of their studies was conducted by NIOSH
investigator Timothy Pizatella [7]. He obtained cooperation of 60 machine operators
working in two large machine shop. Most of them worked on mechanical presses as a
major or minor part of their work. The results demonstrated that many of the participants
could achieve hand speeds faster than 1.6 m/s [7]. From this ﬁnding, the logical conclu‐
sion is that the hand speed constant in the “safe distance” formula should be increased
to some value greater than 1.6 m/s. The authors of the NIOSH paper concluded that to
protect all operators, the value would need to be 3.0 m/s. If this were to be adopted, the
“safe distance” would become so large it would require press operators to lean their
upper body forward to reach the die on every cycle, and some with shorter arms would
not be able to reach at all. Dellman studied press operations from an ergonomics
perspective, resulting in recommendations to avoid setups that require the operator to
lean forward on every cycle [8]. Because this apparent conﬂict among practical set up
distances, ergonomics, and operator protection seems unresolvable, this study was
undertaken to explore the NIOSH data in a diﬀerent manner.
As described in earlier papers [4, 7], the NIOSH study examined two palm-button
placements, an upper one about shoulder level, and a lower one about waist level. Meas‐
ured from the ﬂoor, these were at 106 cm and 84 cm, respectively. Figure 1 illustrates
these two placements and the direction of pushing the buttons. In each placement, the
participating operator followed a protocol resulting in four after reaches. For each
placement, the NIOSH investigators took the fastest of the four reaches by each operator.
This resulted in a data set containing 60 out of the 240 after-reach times for each
placement.

For the present study, a diﬀerent approach was taken. Instead of taking each opera‐
tor’s fastest of four after-reach motions, this analysis explored the inclusion of all four.
By approaching the data this way, after-reach speed distributions may be developed—
allowing identiﬁcation of speeds for which particular percentiles of all 240 after-reach
movements were slower. The end-point of this investigation is to provide information
that will be available for consideration by standard-setting organizations concerned
about the safe operation of mechanical power presses and other machines operated by
two-hand actuation.
2
Methods
2.1
Data Source
After-reach data used for this analysis came from the NIOSH study of 60 machine oper‐
ators. Each operator performed four after reach motions in a lower-level placement, and
four in an upper placement. Using the NIOSH data, the approach reported for this paper
was to include all of the 240 after-reach speed measurements in each placement.
2.2
Data Analysis
The initial analysis used two data sets—one for the upper placement, and one for the
lower placement. Values were mean speeds for each of the 60 subjects. Plots clearly
showed each distribution was other than normal; both being skewed to the right. In order
to identify points in the distribution corresponding to percentiles, each subject-speciﬁc
mean speed was transformed by its log10. Histograms and normal probability plots for
the transformed datasets were generated for examination visually and statistically.
For each placement, all 240 after-reach speeds were combined in a data set and
transformed to their log10 values. Using the mean and standard deviation of each data
set, speed values were identiﬁed corresponding to common percentiles levels (2, 5, 10
25, 50, 75, 90, 95, 98, and 100). For each percentile point of the transformed data, the
original after-reach speed values were identiﬁed.

Results
The initial aim of this statistical analyses was to establish data sets that ﬁt a normal
distribution. The steps described in the following subsections involved: (1) checking the
raw speed data for normality, (2) ﬁnding a transformation that that provides a normal
distribution, and (3) identifying after-reach speeds corresponding to percentiles of the
after-reaches.
3.1
Checking Raw Data for Normality
The subject-speciﬁc mean speeds (S) were organized into two data sets. These were
initially examined for normality using Minitab 17 software. For each set of mean speed

data, the null hypothesis of normality was rejected (p < .01). Figure 2 contains graphs
for the upper placement mean after-reach speeds. Figure 3 has the same types of graphs
for the lower placements.

3.2
Transformation to Create a Normally Distributed Data Set
These subject-speciﬁc mean speeds were transformed using the function log10 S. The
two transformed datasets for upper and lower placements were tested for normality by
visually examining histograms and running a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. The null
hypothesis was that the dataset is normally distributed.
Graphs of the upper-placement and lower-placement transformed data are displayed
in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. Also shown to the right of the plot are results of the
statistical comparison. Both KS values were greater than the traditional 0.05 rejection
level (each p > 0.15); therefore, the null hypothesis of normality was not rejected. Thus,
subsequent analyses were based on the belief that each set of transformed data consisted
of normally distributed values of log10 S.

3.3
After-Reach Speeds by Percentiles
Using the mean and standard deviation of the transformed data sets (each with 240 speed
values), points were identiﬁed for various percentiles of values below the points. For
each percentile point of the transformed data, the corresponding after-reach speed values
(m/s) were identiﬁed. Table 1 contains the percentile values and the corresponding after-
reach speed for the two placements.
An example of how the Table 1 data should be interpreted is illustrated using the 95
percentile value. Out of all after-reach motions made by press operators, 95% will be
safe if the hand speed constant were to be 2.142 m/s for the upper placement, and
1.877 m/s for the lower placement.

Discussion and Conclusions
If standard-setting bodies decide to reconsider the after-reach speed value, they should
appreciate two diﬀerent approaches for choosing a speed constant in relation to
percentage protected. The ﬁrst is to seek a speed to protect the operators with the fastest
speeds. That is the traditional approach used for occupational exposures to health
hazards. The second is to seek a speed to protect a speciﬁed percentage of after-reaches
that may occur among press operators. That is what this study explored.
One rationale for considering this alternative approach is our lack of knowledge of
how frequently after-reach motions are made. Machine operators using a press with two-
hand actuation may do so with frequencies ranging from infrequent to full time. Second,
we do not know how frequently operators make an after-reach motion. For example, out
of 100,000 cycles, how many after-reach movements can we expect, and of these, how
many result in an operator reaching all the way to the point-of operation?
Another part of this rationale stems from the way occupational safety standards are
developed. An example from the United States may serve to illustrate this point. In the
process of making a fall protection standard, the consensus is that employers should
only be required to provide fall protection when one of their employees is exposed to a
fall greater than X feet. Various standards organizations have adopted diﬀerent
distances, e.g., 15, 10, 6, and 4 feet. Regardless of which height is adopted, some people
who fall less than that distance will sustain a seriously injured, and some will die.
Knowing this, the standard setting organizations have attempted to incorporate a fall
distance that involves a compromise between protection and practicabililty. A relatively
conservative standard like 4 foot will protect a large percentage of those who fall, but
not 100%, and probably not even 90%. The point is that when occupational safety stand‐
ards are developed, practicability plays a more signiﬁcant role that when occupational
health standards are developed.
In conclusion, this paper describes objective information on the distribution of after-
reach speeds based on tests of 60 machine operators working in two American machine

shops. It identiﬁes the after-reach speeds that were less than particular percentiles, and
oﬀers that information for consideration by standards making organizations.

Abstract. There are many ways that product manufacturers can communicate
risk to consumers. The hazard control hierarchy describes the fundamental
elements and appropriate methodology for implementation of research-supported
concepts and provides eﬀective techniques for risk communication. Distinctions
among types of risk communication and relevant standards are reviewed.
Comprehension of risk information by product users is an essential part of the
communication process. Label conspicuity and placement on the product are
considered as to how they impact the eﬃcacy of a warning, and are evaluated in
real-world applications. Anti-warnings: communications that downplay risks
and/or undermine warnings are also important to consider and are discussed rela‐
tive to their eﬀect on warning communications.

Introduction
There are several ways that product manufacturers can address risk to consumers,
including the hazard control hierarchy, techniques for risk communication, relevant
standards and label conspicuity.

The Hazard Control Hierarchy
The hierarchy of risk, also referred to as the safety hierarchy or hazard control hierarchy,
is typically deﬁned by three fundamental elements: design, guarding, and warning [1,
2]. Design refers to the primary step in risk identiﬁcation and management, in which
potential hazards are designed out or eﬀectively removed from the product. The second
level, guarding or barriers, separates users from the hazards. Warning, or risk commu‐
nication, represents the third level of the hierarchy and is used when neither of the ﬁrst
two approaches is feasible or while changes are in process. While a properly designed
warning communicates suﬃcient information to allow individuals to make informed

decisions on product use, this remains the least preferred method due to the diﬃculty in
reliably inﬂuencing behavior.
2.1
Basic Fundamental Elements
As depicted in Fig. 1, the base of the hierarchy is the product design itself; the second
level is to guard, and the ﬁnal level, warn, is the least eﬀective. The elements are priori‐
tized from the base to the apex.

Design
Fig. 1. The hazard control hierarchy is typically deﬁned by three fundamental elements: design,
guard, and warn.
Design. Manufacturers have the responsibility to remove known risks from products
to the extent possible. The concept of risk applies not only to dangers that are present
due to design characteristics or ﬂaws, but also those indicated by potential design failures
due to foreseeable misuses [2]. After a product or process has been fully designed, it
must be reviewed with the speciﬁc intent of identifying safety risks by testing it with
the foreseeable user population. For optimal safety results, a design will be revised as
necessary, addressing each identiﬁed risk, until all are reduced or eliminated to the extent
possible. Risks eliminated in the design phase of implementation will not be presented
to consumers, and thus will not contribute to the potential of accident or injury [2].
Unfortunately, such resolution is often not possible, because modiﬁcations will coun‐
tervail the purpose and use of the product or because the mitigation of one risk will
disproportionately increase or unintentionally create another risk.
Barrier/Guard. When not all identiﬁed risks can be adequately reduced or eliminated
through design, those that remain are addressed by guarding: a barrier that physically
prevents users from exposing themselves to product risk [2]. An example of a barrier is
a guard covering the blade of a table saw. For less tangible products, barriers are some‐
what harder to describe but are no less present. Computers regularly come with preloaded
antiviral programs and ﬁrewalls, presenting an intangible barrier to certain risks inherent
with an internet connection.
226
M.L. Bench et al.

Warn. Warning is the ﬁnal and least optimal stage of the fundamental risk hierarchy.
When neither design changes nor barriers are feasible or eﬀective, a warning is used [2].
Warnings are the least eﬀective strategy of the three fundamental levels of the hierarchy
because they are designed to inform rather than limit a consumer [2] (see Sect. 3.2).
2.2
Elements May Be Added in Certain Use Environments
There are additional hierarchy elements appropriate for inclusion in certain environ‐
ments, such as the provision for personal protective equipment (PPE), safety policies/
procedures, and training. Risk hierarchies for workplace policies and procedures (in
addition to product warnings and instructions) can be considered separately from those
developed for products, due to the inherent diﬀerences. Training of policy and proce‐
dural design, deﬁned for the purposes of this section as the establishment of proper usage
protocol recommended to workers, can be adjusted at any point in time, including after
being introduced to the workplace.
2.3
Adoption of Hazard Control Hierarchy
Users cannot beneﬁt from risk reduction unless an appropriate hierarchical design is
both adopted and implemented. Even successful implementation will not eliminate
100% of risks presented to consumers: the goal of a risk hierarchy is to lower the risk
levels to the lowest practicable level, or ALARP (as low as reasonably practicable) in
UK Health and Safety legislature [3]. Similar standards can be referred to under a number
of names, such as ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) common to the US [4],
the ‘essential requirements’ set forth by the EU-OSHA [5], or the more general concept
of ‘good engineering practices.’
3
Methods to Communicate Risk
There are diﬀerent ways to communicate risk. Primarily, instructions and warnings will
be deﬁned and diﬀerentiated; the former not requiring the consistent formatting seen in
a recognized warning.
3.1
Instructions
Instructions are designed to inform consumers of the proper and intended uses of a
product in order to minimize exposure to risk and are included with nearly every product,
whether it be a toy, a vat of industrial chemical, or an assembly-required chair. The
American National Standards Institute (ANSI) categorizes instructions and manuals as
‘collateral materials,’ which often contain multiple pages of integrated, non-safety
information alongside multiple longer and more detailed safety messages, which would
not be practical to communicate on a label or sign. The ANSI Z535.6 under the title
‘Product Safety Information in Product Manuals, Instructions, and Other Collateral
Material’ deﬁnes standards for proper colors, symbols, and information required in risk
Risk Communication for Consumer Products
227

communication in such materials [6]. These are paralleled by international standards
such as IEC 82097-1 and ISO 3864, used respectively for establishing regulation of
instructions and graphical symbols [7].
3.2
Warnings
Warnings are used to address a variety of risks: when using a product, performing a task,
or encountering a speciﬁc environment [2].
Development. In order to eﬀectively communicate risk, it is important to test warnings
and symbols with foreseeable users to verify that they are understood [8]. This is an
iterative process, which requires constant updating throughout a product’s development
and release. Initial development of a warning communication system must be done
during the product development to address risks that cannot be reduced to acceptable
levels with a warning. Risk communications should be comprehensive, relevant, and
evaluated for comprehension. Warning development requires identifying all foreseeable
user populations, identifying potential confounding factors – such as native language
and education level – which may negate the eﬃcacy of a communication, and developing
warnings that will be understood by relevant populations.
After a product is placed in an open market, active monitoring and evaluation must
be maintained, both for the identiﬁcation of unforeseen or unidentiﬁed risks which were
missed during earlier developmental phases and for failures in risk communication and
product labeling (on product, packaging, manuals, advertising, website). After exposure
to the general public, issues such as incomprehensible language, unclear use of symbols,
or inconspicuous placement of warning labels should be evaluated based on incident
occurrence. If such failures are identiﬁed, or if newer adaptions of a product are to be
released, risk communications must be updated accordingly to remain eﬀective [9].
Warning Design. The design of a risk communication associated with consumer prod‐
ucts is intrinsically related to the ﬁnal eﬃcacy in terms of consumer safety. If a warning
design is suboptimal, communication of potential risks associated with a product can be
undermined in a myriad of ways so manufacturers are obligated to consider many factors
relating to the product and consumers, which will aﬀect the ﬁnal warning design.
The medium of a risk communication is of primary consideration – while visual risk
communications are the most common, consumers may also be presented with risks in
auditory and olfactory formats, addressed below. Both the product being marketed and
the population it is marketed to must be evaluated to determine the most appropriate
medium for risk communication.
If consumers are expected to include youths, multilingual communities, or individ‐
uals without speciﬁc knowledge or training in product use, the use of pictorials and
symbols may be more eﬀective [10]. If a target market is expected to have an increased
degree of training and knowledge before product use (licensed or certiﬁed users),
complex language may be considered more eﬀective in expressing the risks present with
product usage. An example of this would be industrial or laboratory equipment – such
products are not marketed to home consumers, and professionally trained users (surgeon,
228
M.L. Bench et al.

professional engineer, etc.) may be expected to have a greater understanding of the
language associated with speciﬁc risks and instructions on how to avoid them.
Standards. The eﬃcacy of warnings as risk communications is dependent on the ability
of the target audience – consumers of the product – to understand the dangers described
in the warning. Intrinsic to this goal is the standardization of warnings. Standards not
only regulate the method of communication, but the manner by which risks are to be
communicated. Comprehension must be expected for the target audience in order for a
warning to be considered eﬀective.
One such standard, ANSI Z535, used primarily within the United States [11], speci‐
fies six sub-standards: (1) safety colors; (2) environmental and facility safety signs; (3)
criteria for safety symbols; (4) safety signs and labels; (5) safety tags and barricade tapes
(utilized in the instance of temporary hazards) and (6) product safety information in
product manuals, instructions, and other collateral materials. These standards are estab‐
lished on the basis of human factors research and court case precedents, formally revised
twice each decade. ANSI Z535 conforming signs use signal words – ‘danger’, ‘warning’,
‘caution’, (safety notice signs use ‘notice’ or ‘safety instructions’ specific to a situation) –
accompanied by hazard details, consequences, and avoidance procedures. Figure 2 depicts
a warning designed according to the ANSI Z535 criteria.

for “warning is orange”.
International Standards. While ANSI Z535 may be eﬀective within its sphere of
inﬂuence, the United States is far from the only domain to have established a standard‐
ization of risk communication in the interest of public protection. International standards
Risk Communication for Consumer Products
229

are set forth by the International Standards Organization; ISO 3864 generally corre‐
sponds, in eﬀect and intent with the ANSI Z535 [7]. However, it is necessary to note
that these documents do not coincide on all points. For instance, ISO 3864 uses the color
yellow for all safety messages, while ANSI Z535 uses red for the most severely ranked
safety risks, as well as prohibited activities and ﬁre safety; yellow and orange are used
for other warnings. Pictorials are encouraged whenever practical under ANSI Z535 in
standard format of black graphic on a white background; whereas ISO formatted
graphics refer to a mandatory action, a white graphic inside a blue circle; a prohibited
action, a black graphic inside a red circle outline with slash; or a hazard identiﬁcation,
a black graphic inside a yellow triangle.
Closely related to the ISO 3864 is ISO 7010 [12]. The guidelines most recently
released in 2012, deﬁne the manner of safety signs to be used for purposes of protection
from accidents, ﬁres, or health hazards, using ISO 3864-1 guidelines to establish the
shape and color of each sign and ISO 3864-3 to determine the design of graphical
symbols [13]. These standards were developed speciﬁcally to supersede language
barriers, communicating potential risks successfully, regardless of the consumers’ native
tongue.
Corresponding Colors. One of the more prominent features of warnings is their corre‐
sponding colors. All colors used for the purpose of warnings tend to share the charac‐
teristic of high conspicuity. This is due to the increased eﬃcacy of warnings associated
with increased detection.
Safety Symbols. One of the most universal types of warning is the safety alert symbol.
As symbols cannot be eﬀective at communicating a message to their target audience,
their prevalence and relative equality across communities are central contributors to the
eﬃcacy of this method of risk communication. An example of a safety symbol published
by the ISO is depicted in Fig. 3 [12].
Fig. 3. Safety alert symbol
Pictorials. Pictorials are diﬀerentiated from symbols since they rely primarily upon
visual imagery to convey information, but may be more detailed or less stylized than
symbols, and may also include words or alternative methods of communication. As
pictorials may also contain written messages, they are more capable of conveying
explicit risks or instructions than symbols, which contain only an image [14]. Pictorials
are used on medication labels in order to reduce miscommunications about prescribed
dosages and instructions for use. Pictorials provide warnings that are comprehensible
to a greater percentage of the population, especially those of an age, education level, or
language ﬂuency which may limit their understanding of written warnings or instruc‐
tions. Although they have been found less eﬀective for communicating complex or
abstract risks, pictorials may be used with great eﬃciency and eﬃcacy for
230
M.L. Bench et al.

communicating concrete risks or simple instructions that are widely comprehendible to
the consumer public [15].
Examples. Pictorials and symbols can be combined on a warning label. This approach
allows potential users to see the symbols which indicate that a hazard is associated with
the product and provide more speciﬁc information about the nature of the hazards. For
example, in Fig. 4, the triangular safety alert symbol precedes the signal word
“DANGER” and the diamond symbols indicate ﬂammable and contents under pressure.
The pictorials provide the additional speciﬁc information about inhalation, explosion
and ﬁre hazards.
Fig. 4. Some warning labels combine both pictorials and symbols.
Pictorial risk communications are perhaps best exempliﬁed by the recent push in
many countries by the World Health Organization to increase consumer awareness of
the health hazards associated with cigarettes [16]. These campaigns have resulted in the
presentation of dangers in the form of graphic images placed upon cigarette packs and
cartons with the intent to alert consumers of diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds
of the hazard. More basic pictorials are presented in the form of symbols, commonly
found internationally: a red circle with a line through it is recognized to signal a
prohibited action; a yellow sign outlined in black indicates caution regarding the symbol
shown. standardized risk communications [12].
3.3
Other Types of Risk Communication
When an on-product warning label is not appropriate or possible, there are other methods
available to communicate potential hazards.
Visual. Both traditional warning labels and other visual warnings rely on communi‐
cation through written words. However, there are limitations to this approach if the
consumer population is uneducated or unversed in the language that a warning or
Risk Communication for Consumer Products
231

instruction is written in, or disinterested in reading information associated with potential
product risks. Visual warnings include red, orange, or ﬂashing lights [17].
Auditory. Auditory risk communications are less common than visual media [17].
Pedestrians are alerted by chirping traﬃc signals, while mass transit riders hear recorded
instruction messages over a PA system. Oral risk communications are commonly found
as recorded messages. These may be found on their own, or in conjunction with visual
warnings such as in videos created to instruct consumers on proper product use. These
risk communications may be as long or short as the hazards they communicate warrant:
a toxic chemical spill within a factory will warrant a succinct evacuation message which
includes no unnecessary wording, while an instructional video designed to guide users
through the installation and startup of a new software product may last much longer,
explicitly guiding users around multiple minor hazards which could negatively impact
product performance. Other types of nonverbal warnings include sirens on emergency
vehicles, car horns, smoke alarms, and back-up alarms.
Olfactory. Olfactory warnings are eﬀective only if the scent presented is easily and
widely recognizable as a warning and if the consumer has an eﬀective sense of small
(due to disease, illness or injury). Natural gas may be one of the most prominent exam‐
ples of this phenomenon. While the scent of a natural gas leak is almost universally
recognizable and always associated with a warning. However, natural gas is actually
odorless. The scent the general public associates with natural gas is the chemical
mercaptan, artiﬁcially added to provide an indication of a natural gas leak. There is a
limitation to the eﬃcacy of olfactory warnings in that many people temporarily or
permanently do not have a sense of smell. For example, people with allergies or a cold
may not be able to detect the scent of an olfactory warning [18].

Location
Risk communication depends on warning conspicuity in order to attract consumer atten‐
tion. If a message does not attract the attention of a product user, the label is ineﬀective.
On-product. The most effective location for risk communication for consumer products
is placed directly on the product, which can be applied to both tangible – through obvious
means, such as a sewn tag on textiles or an adhered label on manufactured goods – and
intangible objects, such as an insurance policy purchased through face-to-face meetings
with an agent. Warning label placement and interaction with the warning have been shown
to improve the efficacy of risk communication in attracting attention but also showed that
no label was 100% effective in mediating safe user behavior [19]. Thus, placement of a
risk communication is not sufficient by itself to promote safe practices and must be paired
with effective methods of communication to influence user behavior.
Manual. Printed user manuals may be the least eﬀective placement for successful risk
communication that a manufacturer can rely on. Research published in 2006 indicated
that the printed user manual is in fact the least likely medium by which consumers seek
232
M.L. Bench et al.

product information, used by an average of 3.16% of the product-using population. These
consumers were more likely to use another of the surveyed options: asking others for
help, searching online, or solving problems on their own [20]. Of those likely to consult
the user manual, many do not read the manual from cover to cover. Manuals can be
accessed on-line and because they are an important aspect of informing users who rely
on them to search for speciﬁc product-use information, it is important that this infor‐
mation source, which is not limited by the length restrictions that a label has, provide
complete safety and use information. At the present, manufacturers are required to place
all on-product warnings within the manual as well, though the converse is not true [21].
Websites. Over the last two decades, companies have begun to place product warnings
and instruction manuals on their websites in addition to the products themselves. This
can be done in a multitude of ways, and is also found with intangible products. Software
or media purchased online is unlikely to contain a warning present in the product itself,
and as such will often direct users to the producing company’s website for further
instructions and warnings. Physical products have begun more commonly to use a
similar strategy, including warnings and basic instructions with the product and
instructing consumers to consult a website page for additional information. While risk
communications placed directly on a product will be present for viewing each time a
product is used, only a small minority of consumers can be expected to go out of their
way to seek additional information online [22]. Online information should be in addition
to, but not instead of, important risk communication on the product itself.
Packaging. Warnings should be placed on product packaging so the information is
available to consumers at the time they are making their purchasing decisions. The
potential time on-package warnings are available for viewing by consumers may be
limited because common behavior is to remove packaging as disposable, and retaining
only what is necessary for product function. Although there is no physical wrapping
present for software or media purchased with a computer, many of these products will
be prefaced with a warning before they are installed or downloaded onto a user’s
computer, requiring the purchaser to check a box verifying they have read the contents
of a warning and agree. Such communications are actually inspected with great infre‐
quency, with one study claiming as few as 3% of consumers read online Terms and
Agreements contracts thoroughly [23].
Advertising. Some risk communications are found in advertisements. As these are
designed to be a potential consumer’s primary introduction to a product, they are regu‐
larly found only where explicitly required by law, often with overt attempts to downplay
or disregard the message they communicate (see anti-warnings, Sect. 5). Manufacturers
tend to design these communications speciﬁcally with a goal to prevent negative impacts
on consumer consideration of the product in question.
Risk Communication for Consumer Products
233

Anti-warning: Downplaying Risk
Manufacturers have historically used two strategies to weaken the impact of warnings: (1)
Warn inadequately or not warn at all; (2) Produce media that deliberately misrepresent
dangerous products as safe in order to contradict warnings [24]. Anti-warnings are commu‐
nications that may be used to downplay risks and assuage user concerns. Anti-warnings,
contradictory to the name used here to describe them, tend to show more of a superficial
resemblance to advertisements than warnings when they are presented on a product. As can
be commonly seen in ads, whether they are roadway billboards, magazine spreads, or
online, companies design these media formats to present information encouraging consum‐
erism, minimizing negative factors such as risk whenever possible.
The design of anti-warnings extends beyond their location. Often, they contain
written descriptions of the unsafe or inappropriate behavior they encourage. As this type
of message tends to be regulated – if a safety risk is severe enough to warrant a regulated
warning, there is commonly associated legislation restricting direct contradictions
published by the manufacturer – anti-warnings are less likely to contain explicit instruc‐
tions contradicting warnings, and more likely to present a message designed to attract
consumers to the product. Depending on the product, this may be an emotional appeal
or claim to greater happiness, attractiveness, entertainment, or health. Regardless of the
exact wording, fonts will be large, bold, friendly or exciting, picked by the manufacturers
for the purpose of attracting consumer attention and inciting positive reactions either
consciously or subconsciously [24]. The pictorial format tends to be popular for anti-
warnings, as it allows bright, optimistic, eye-catching imagery to be presented front and
center, accompanied by simple, accessible messages designed to attract consumers. This
image placement allows better communication for anti-warnings, as the use of imagery
contradicting warning labels and safety communications is more common than directly
juxtaposing written messages that directly negate each other [24].
While risk communications are sometimes worded so the average consumer does not
understand them, anti-warnings are presented to not only encourage product purchase, but
also discount the risks presented in warnings. As such, anti-warning labels can be expected
to include common vernacular, and are more likely to be designed to appeal to the target
audience on a more personal level than warnings, which in contrast, are often communi‐
cated in linguistics that appear to require an advanced degree to interpret. Anti-warnings
tend to contain messages carefully worded to imply product attributes either opposing or
negating the information conveyed by the risk communication [24].

Introduction
In the era of modern military operations it made it necessary to develop communication
systems which meet the requirements of use of communication at all levels of opera-
tions. In view of the increasing demands for communications immunity to various
factors, an important topic has become the safety of persons operating a communica-
tions system. This publication shall be analysis of issues related to the safety staying
close to the antennas of military communications systems. The question is whether it is
safe?

Impact of High Frequency Electromagnetic Fields
at Living Cells
The military telecommunication systems in the sub-divisions used in the radio band
from 1.5 MHz to 88 MHz (radio battleﬁeld). Radio stations battleﬁeld sub-divisions
used in the army are working in networks and radio directions in two frequency ranges:
• in the range 1.5 MHz–30 MHz, short-wave radios,
• in the range of 30–88 MHz, ultra-short radio.
Ultra-short-wave radio are designed to provide communications for the small and
medium distances (up to 35 km). Communication range of VHF as a whole covers the

demand for transmission of information at the level of sub-division. Radiation power of
these radio stations is 0.5/5/10 W. At the same time, these radio stations, as shown in
Fig. 1, are used in direct contact with the soldier.
Concern primarily the potential for harm ﬁeld generated by the antenna of radio
stations located next to the body of the operator. There are fears without rational
grounds because the current state of knowledge of the impact energy of electromag-
netic pulse on living organisms giving the impression that the electromagnetic energy
in any amount acts on the human body. This effect is harmless until its effects are
within the limits set by the adaptability, compensation and regeneration, but it may be
harmful after crossing the limits of tolerance of functional system. First hand, it should
be possible communicate with stations that can be in the direction of where the head
and on the other hand, the head should be illuminated the minimum power level and
especially those elements of the bones head, brain, and skin that are characterized by
high thermal absorption coefﬁcient (respectively 14.6, 8.05, 4.42 mW/cm2 °C). In the
currently used radio stations substantial part of the radiated power (50%) is absorbed by
the body of the wearer. This can adversely affect their health.
Therefore have been introduced protection zones in the vicinity of sources of ﬁelds,
in order to protect from harmful electromagnetic radiation characterized by a dose of
radiation and index of exposure. Determination of protection zones in the working
environment is closely associated with a dose of radiation and index of exposure.
Permissible dose of electric ﬁeld (or magnetic) is considered as the value of the
product of the square of the electric ﬁeld (or magnetic), demarcating the danger zone
from the intermediate zone and expressed in hours operating time per person exposed
to the effects of electromagnetic radiation.

Protection from Ionizing Radiation Power at the Location
of Operations Military Communications Systems
Regulation to protect soldiers against the effects of electromagnetic radiation in the
workplace military communications systems deal with defense standards. They intro-
duce levels of spurious emissions and immunity of electromagnetic exposure. In not
regulated aspects by the standard we use civilians requirements with the exception of the
permissible limit of SAR, which regulates the standard STANAG 2345 Edition 3
adopted February 13, 2003 year. In addition, any regulations are not apply in workplaces
equipped with electromagnetically sealed room (containers), guaranteeing complete
isolation from electromagnetic ﬁelds coming from the antennas. Personnel then residing
in the during transmission outside of containers at your own risk. Range of regulations
on electromagnetic emissions radiated has been divided into three areas. The frequency
of the radio station of the battleﬁeld is an interesting one area, the requirement applied to
radiated emissions coming from equipment and shielding subsystems all connection
cables, antenna permanently attached to the EUT (standby/reception receivers and
transmitters) in the frequency range of 10 kHz–18 GHz. This standard limits are given
the intensity of electric and magnetic ﬁelds for the operation, as shown in Fig. 2.

Measurements of Electromagnetic Fields Components
In terms of operating frequencies, the safe limits in the range of 30 MHz–87.975 MHz
is considered the intensity of the electromagnetic ﬁeld on the edge the intermediate
zone and a safe zone, which meet the requirements of STANAG 2345.

In order to perform a reliable measurement of the intensity of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld, the PN-T-06580-3 standard requires to follow a few general conditions of
measurements:
• measurements of electromagnetic ﬁelds should be carried out only by persons who
are aware of the dangers that exist while performing measurements are not any
health contraindications to perform such measurements, and have actually con-
ﬁrmed qualiﬁcations in the metrology ﬁeld of measured ﬁelds;
• the ﬁeld meters used to measure, shall be comply with the relevant standards, or
provide other equivalent measurements;
• during measurements we must locate the source of electromagnetic ﬁelds, as well as
the distribution of ﬁxed and variable staff positions and deﬁne the area of measuring
the intensity of electric and magnetic ﬁelds of the recommended standard uncer-
tainty - not exceeding 20%;
• ﬁeld measurements carried out in these operating conditions sources, at which a
given measurement area are the maximum possible intensity of ﬁelds used during
normal operation of the sources located in the area of measurement;
• measurements should be carried out in an environment deprived of interferences
and disturbances from the environment (electromagnetically sealed room) and the
of uninterrupted by the presence of people [3].
The PN-T-06580-3 standard also regulates other aspects electromagnetic ﬁelds
intensity measurements, such as the designation of protected zones existing at the
measurement, estimation of time of exposure being in the zones.
Before measurements should also determine the measured values during the tests.
According to PN-T-06580-3 standard for frequencies up to 300 GHz should take
measurements of electric ﬁeld strength. In the range up to 3 GHz we must done an
additional measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld. For the purposes of this article identiﬁed
the following measured values:
• the effective value of the electric ﬁeld strength, expressed in [V/m] and [dBV/m];
• the effective value of the magnetic ﬁeld strength, expressed in [A/m] and [dBA/m];
The potential measurement uncertainties may arise from:
• uncertainty of used instrument;
• interaction between the instrument and the source of measured ﬁeld;
• the impact of temperature;
• the impact of air humidity;
• the frequency of measured ﬁeld and the frequency used instrument.
Measurements of the intensity of electric and magnetic ﬁelds should be done in the
area in which all space can be considered as a space position of in an environment
Sources of ﬁelds in which you can stay employees while working.
Basically, the measurements the ﬁeld strength should be carried out in primary and
secondary verticals of measurement. Verticals should be numbered and their location
indicated on the situational plan. This location should match the distribution of staff
positions, the basic vertical measurement must be selected along the axis of body or
head of the employee. The verticals measurements should be performed in such a way as
Soldier Protection of Staying in the Radiated Field
239

to determine the maximum ﬁeld strength, able to work on standing employee and at least
up to 2 m ± 0.05 m. If the measurement would be performed outside the anechoic
chamber, verticals should be set up at distances of not less than 0.15 m ± 0.02 m from
metal structures, and other objects that could affect the ﬁeld distribution in the area of
measurement - while keeping the requirements of the distance of the objects according
to the instructions of the measuring instrument. But if the instruction is not included this
information, the minimum measuring distance should be not less than two - three times
the maximum linear dimension of the probe. Additionally it allows the design of the
device and the same probe at the time of measurement is allowed to perform mea-
surement at a distance of less than 0.15 m - in particular to evaluate the exposure of the
limbs.
Due to the one-man operation backpack radio stations, in measurements will be
used one vertical measurement representing the service directly at the antenna and one
vertical measurement, set at a distance of 3 m from the antenna, representing a single
soldier stationed nearby. In addition, they will perform measurements directly to the
same radio stations. The whole measurement is carried out in an anechoic chamber for
several selected operating frequencies out of all available bandwidth operation. The
frequency range of radio stations do not require additional attenuation ferrites ﬂoor.

ment fulﬁll the criteria, there is shown a top view of the Fig. 3 and in an oblique in

The measurement stand should be the following:
• wooden table with a height of 1 m from the ground reference. Table height rep-
resents the height at which there is a radio station - on the back of a soldier kneeling.
Table size should be as small as possible, preferably 1 m to 1.5 m from the top with
a thickness of 5 cm.
• digital meter of electromagnetic ﬁelds, equipped with a ﬁeld probe for measuring
the instantaneous values components of electric and magnetic ﬁeld. It is accepted
stationary meters and hand meters, making sure to pay attention to the control of
distance measurement using the hand meter.
• anechoic chamber.
Radio stations that are subjects of research have been programmed to work at a
ﬁxed frequency. For radio stations backpack was the mode HLG, the well could be
used HLC mode. The decision on HLG was dictated by the duration of the pro-
gramming radio station. This time, in turn, should be as short as possible, because it
limits the total exposure of the human body to electromagnetic radiation. Finally
adopted the following conﬁguration settings radio stations:
• operating frequency: 30.000 MHz–87.975 MHz;
• output power: 10 W (maximum available);
• selected measurement frequency:
– 30,000 MHz;
– 44,475 MHz;
– 58,975 MHz;

– 74,475 MHz;
– 87,975 MHz.
In the measurements experiment were carried out in anechoic chamber shown in
Fig. 5 by means of electromagnetic ﬁelds meter Wandel & Goltermann EMR-300.
Measurements of the intensity distribution of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld are made at
different distances from the antenna radio stations and different height. For the height of
reference adopted at the height of the radio station located, then increased height from
0 m to 2 m along the height of radio stations antenna.
Below in Figs. 6 and 7 presents the results the intensity of magnetic and electric
ﬁelds at different distances from the antenna when the radio transmitting and receiving.
Additionally, the presented graphs indicated permissible level of electromagnetic
radiation deﬁned in the document STANAG 2345 (Fig. 2).
On the basis of the measurements it can be concluded that with each case and each
measurement exceeding the permissible levels of electromagnetic radiation for both the
emissions from the same radio station, and also on antenna (Fig. 7).
In the case of measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld intensity at a distance of 0 m
from the antenna, permitted levels of RF is not exceeded for the lowest frequency of
working at a height of 2 m from the reference level. Basically, for each height appears
to be increase value of the electric ﬁeld in the central part of the band and its decrease
for the highest frequencies. Very large ﬂuctuations in value we observed for a height of
1.5 m. It can be explained by the repeatability error settings meter at the time of
measurement. Entirely different results were obtained for measurements at a distance of
3 m from the radio antenna. In this case, the results are like most normal scales over the
band and each height. You can see very similar values of the electric ﬁeld at every
height, in addition, the same levels in the entire band evenly.
In the case of measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld strength at a distance of 0 m from
the antenna, permitted levels of RF is not exceeded for the lowest frequency of working
at a height of 2 m from the reference level. Basically, for each height appears to be
increase the value of magnetic ﬁeld strength in the middle of the band and the decrease
the highest frequency. Large ﬂuctuations in value observed for a height of 1.5 m can be
explained repeatability error settings meter at the time of measurement.

Completely different results were obtained for measurement at a distance of 3 m
from the antenna radio. In this case, the results are as much as possible in the standard
in the whole band and each height. It can be observed very similar values of magnetic
ﬁeld strength at each of the heights, in addition to the same levels they are highly
uniformly throughout the band.
Measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld the same device radio station have revealed
that the levels of emission limit of the magnetic ﬁeld are not exceeded only when the

radio is not transmitting. The radio station emits a very low value of ﬁeld strength in the
whole band, and when we pressing a button on the handset the power of ﬁeld strength
are increments. For frequencies of 30 MHz, this level is exceeded twice, while
increasing the frequency will increase the ﬁeld strength level until they reach-frequency
58.975 MHz, only to decrease slightly.
In the case of measurements of the electric ﬁeld at a distance of 0 m from the
antenna, the maximum permissible emission levels of the electric ﬁeld is exceeded over

the operating band and each height. For the lowest frequencies, i.e. 30 MHz and
44.475 MHz, this level is exceeded several times, and then begins increase very
sharply with increasing frequency, reaching the highest value for the lowest mea-
surements made.
Measurements made at a distance of 3 m from the antenna presented a slightly
different situation. Well, in a distance of 3 m from the antenna, at a height of 2 m from
the ground, horizontal electric ﬁeld is below the permitted maximum.
It should be emphasized that the guidelines for exposure to radio waves used by the
physical quantity is abbreviated Speciﬁc Absorption Rate (SAR), which determines the
speciﬁc energy absorption rate. The speciﬁc rate of energy absorption is a measure of
the rate at which energy is absorbed by the body when it is exposed to radio frequency
electromagnetic ﬁelds. It is deﬁned as the power absorbed by the mass of tissue of the
human body, and its unit is the watt kilogram (W/kg).
Speciﬁc Absorption Rate can be calculated from the electric ﬁeld from the
relationship:
SAR ¼
Z
sample
r rð Þ E rð Þ
j
j2
q rð Þ
dr
ð1Þ
where:
• r - conductivity of the sample,
• E - the value of the effective electric ﬁeld,
• q - density of the sample.
On the basis of this relationship which takes into account the exposure time, its
importance, the mental state of the radio operator of the battleﬁeld, we can say whether
they will be exceeded dose of radiation.
In the case of Speciﬁc Absorption Rate, according to the standard STANAG 2345
the maximum valueis 0.4 W/kg in the frequency range of 100 kHz–6 GHz. This level
has been established as a tenfold lower Speciﬁc Absorption Rate value of 4 W/kg,
which is the limit value at which followed potentially an irreversible biological changes
of the human body [4].

Conclusions
Taking into account the analysis undertaken of safety aspects stay in the electromag-
netic ﬁeld from antenna of military communications systems and the results of mea-
surements of the ﬁeld strength of the electromagnetic radio battleﬁeld was found high
health concerns supports radio station. The radio station with a power of 10 W, while
in receive mode only meets safety standards for both located near the radio station, as
well as for wearing it on your back. Unfortunately, at the moment of pressing button on
handset causes a large emission of electromagnetic ﬁelds (high level of magnetic ﬁeld
strength, very high electric ﬁeld), which certainly in the long and speculative and

short-term may cause negative or detrimental effect for the human body in a direct
contact with the radio station and included with the antenna.
Based on measurements taken at a distance of 3 m away from the radio station and
antenna were found much lower level of intensity of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. How-
ever, it is not low enough to distance this be considered a safe zone.
Broadcasting radio station on your back with 10 W carries a risk of injury. It would
be useful to limit dwell time in the vicinity of radio station, especially if the radio
station is often transmitting.
The research was conducted for radio stations with maximum power “only” 10 W.
The Polish Army backpack radios are available with much higher maximum power
output. In addition, the impossibility of carry out measurements of SAR, it became
impossible to carry out a full analysis of the risks of working in direct contact with the
radio station working with the power of 10 W.
In summary, based on our review of the safety issues we developed the following
recommendations for working with radio station backpack:
• Avoid approaching the radio stations at a distance of less than at least 3 m, and if
this is not possible, go away for a maximum offered by the handset cable distance;
• As much as possible to avoid transmission of radio station located on the back;
• use, as far as possible, with the lowest possible power output offered by the station;
• limit exposure time near the radio stations if the radio often and long passes in the
transmission mode.

Introduction
The progress of computerization and IT systems in the 1980s led to a signiﬁcant change
in the nature of the workplace, leading to reconﬁguration of work systems and employ‐
ment relationships. The paradox produced by these forces is striking: employment rela‐
tionship is becoming more market-mediated while at the same time business perform‐
ance in an increasingly knowledge-driven economy requires high levels of trust,
commitment, information sharing, and coordination. What is particularly important is
that internationalization of production processes and the ubiquitous application of infor‐
mation technology in production of goods and services are important sources of compet‐
itive pressure on ﬁrms. However, they are not the only sources of heightened competition
among ﬁrms. Vertically integrated organizations and internal labor markets are being
replaced by arm’s length relationships and subcontracted work designed, in the absence
of strong unions, to intensify the work [1]. Outsourcing and oﬀ-shoring are in use, which
means moving jobs to workplaces where labor is cheaper. Due to computer software
and progressing automation and robotization, labor shifts from human work to technical
work [2]. Both the technological revolution and globalization have transformed the
competitive landscape and the situation of the employee [3].
Digital technologies are doing for human brainpower what the steam engine and
related technologies did for human muscle power during the Industrial Revolution. They
allow us to overcome many limitations rapidly and to open up new frontiers with

unprecedented speed. Their impact cannot be overestimated. However, there is a social
price for that referred to as ‘unpleasant side eﬀects’. Digital innovations contribute to
the stagnation in average incomes in the United States and to the disappearance of many
middle-level jobs. The number of people in employment is getting lower, as technologies
have decreased the demand for low-skilled information workers [4].
The objective reality requires that the problem should be viewed from the perspective
of employees who expect acceptable work conditions and stability of income sources.
Therefore, the authors decided to ﬁnd out employees’ opinions on the threats posed by
increasing automation and its expected eﬀects on work conditions.

Research Problems
2.1
Automation as the Contemporary Focus in Labor Research
Digitalization of occupational life is becoming a fact. Communication in both private
and occupational life via Web Services 2.0, or using more and more sophisticated soft‐
ware for social cooperation in the form of private and business networks have become
a standard. The Digital Workplace concept addresses the changing conditions of knowl‐
edge-based labor. It meets the technical and cultural requirements as well as any neces‐
sary adjustments to the current labor environment [5].
The reasons for the decrease in the number of jobs have been sought since the 1980s.
Especially ever since the end of the Great Recession, the rate of creating jobs has not
been keeping up with the population growth. Proﬁts made by companies have doubled
since 2000, however, the average income per household (inﬂation-adjusted) has fallen
from $55,986 to $51,017. At the same time, the share of corporate proﬁt after tax in
GDP rose from ca. 5 to 11%, while the share of employment-related costs in GDP
dropped from ca. 47 to 43%. Somehow, companies make more proﬁt employing fewer
people. The number of jobs requiring low qualiﬁcations has been decreasing dramati‐
cally and faster than the rate of creating new ones. Research studies show that so-called
routine jobs (bank teller, machine operator, dressmaker) began to fade in the 1980s,
when computers ﬁrst made their presence known, and the rate has accelerated: between
2001 and 2011, 11% of routine jobs disappeared [4].
The focus in the search for answers to the research questions has moved from the
macro level to the level of jobs. Frey and Osborne have published a quantitative and
qualitative method to specify the probability of replacing human labor in a given job
and specialization with computer software (digitalization). The authors used the O*NET
database of 903 occupations, comparing the data to 702 occupation descriptions
(Standard Occupational Classiﬁcation). That gave Frey and Osborne a lot of detailed
descriptions of diﬀerent tasks related to an occupation, since O*NET has detailed
descriptions of “direct work activities” included in each of its occupations [6]. Then they
distinguished three areas of human activity where computers must perform tasks cheaper
and with comparable quality before they start replacing people. The computerization
bottlenecks were then divided into subdomains. The set includes: perception and manip‐
ulation (comprising the subdomains: ﬁnger dexterity, manual dexterity, cramped work
spaces and/or awkward positions), creative intelligence (with originality and ﬁne art)
Work Automation and Psychophysical Hazards in Employees’ Opinion

and social intelligence, comprising social perceptiveness, negotiations, persuasion,
assisting and caring for others. Then 70 occupations were singled out as the ones bound
for computerization, and subjective measures of susceptibility to computerization were
determined (being the value of 1 or 0). “Probabilistic classiﬁcation” was used for the
algorithmic part of the job. Vectors for 70 occupations were determined by means of
the multiple method. The results show that there was a fairly systematic relation between
the data in the 9-data vector and the labels and as a consequence the P(y) probabilities.
The fuzzy set theory assumptions were used for calibration. According to Frey and
Osborne, occupations showing a probability of computerization below 30% are consid‐
ered to be at low risk, whereas occupations where that probability exceeds 70% are
deemed to be at high risk.
Research results show that 47% of total US employment falls within the high risk
category, meaning that associated occupations are potentially automatable over some
unspeciﬁed number of years, perhaps a decade or two [6]. The corresponding share for
Finland is 35% and for Norway 33%, i.e., 14–16% points less than in the US [7]. In the
UK, 35% of jobs are at high risk of computerization (though diﬀerences between the
UK and US classiﬁcations mean that the ﬁgures are not directly comparable). The results
suggest that as technological capabilities expand and costs decline, we can expect devel‐
opments like Machine Learning and Mobile Robotics to gradually replace labor in the
same wide range of occupations as in the US, spanning transport, production, construc‐
tion, manufacturing, services and sales [8].
Researchers point out to the need to develop the research methodology. This pertains
especially to the ways of assigning probabilities for a certain outcome in connection
with an occupation based on the characteristics of that occupation, and subjectivity in
specifying susceptibility for automation. Some researchers point out the diﬀerences in
task deﬁning, which is one of the key issues decisive for the methodology correctness [9].
This study focuses on analysis of employee opinions regarding labor automation and
related threats identiﬁed by them.
2.2
Psychophysical Factors in the Transformation Perspective
Labor being part of human activity is subject to changes resulting from the development
of technology, knowledge and culture. From the onset of industrialization, labor study
focused on the following archetypes: mechanistic (simpliﬁcation, specialization and
repeatability of work), motivational (enriching the tasks, autonomy, task diversity),
perceptive (decreasing the information as a result of increased machinization and mech‐
anization as a factor of decreasing the probability of errors, accidents and mental over‐
load) and biological. The last one emphasizes the mental and environmental stressogenic
factors and increased importance of the factors to decrease physical discomfort and
stress. However, the authors of contemporary concepts of job design preserve the clas‐
sical assumption that work may be divided into three major constituents: work
complexity, social environment and physical environment [10]. Still, they also point out
to the fact that physical requirements are ignored in the latest concepts of job design,
which is inconsistent with the results of the research studies completed so far, as the
research results have shown a signiﬁcant level of correlation between such elements as
250
J. Rymaniak and K. Lis

physical activity, work conditions, applied technology or ergonomic features, and
human labor results [11]. Impact of work on an individual is also subject to change.
Therefore, it is still important to pay attention to the physical characteristics of work,
taking into account work conditions, ergonomics, physical requirements, strain and
activity level (understood as mental strain) as well as equipment and tools [12]. This
approach to job design is close to ergonomic design which is focused on the human
factor aimed at avoiding unfavorable health consequences resulting from occupational
hazards [13]. From the perspective of labor safety, a human in the work process is
exposed to hazardous (leading to injuries), onerous and harmful factors. Hazardous
factors are those which may cause an injury to a human, i.e. an accident at work. The
literature speciﬁes several major groups of such hazards:
• hazards caused by sharp or protruding objects,
• hazards caused by movable and loose objects,
• risk of electric shock,
• risk of scalding,
• hazards connected with people movement,
• risk of ﬁre and/or explosion.
Onerous factors are those which may lead to decreasing the physical and mental ability
of an employee. Harmful factors, in turn, may cause poisonings, and even death.
Comparison of various approaches to job design, modifying the conditions of the mate‐
rial environment in which the work process takes place, shows the importance of setting
appropriate criteria for employees and employers [14, 15]. The research studies results
show that the most signiﬁcant criteria for employees include tiring posture (ergonomics),
psychosocial strain, risk posed by machines and work environment factors (work condi‐
tions).
Due to the transformations in the area of labor it is also worth noting that the length
of occupational activity of people is being extended due to the population ageing process.
Thus, the changes taking place in technology are also used at workplaces by older and
older employees [16]. The assumption that application of IT at work will help reduce
physical strain and improve working conditions for mature age people is correct.
However, on the other hand, elimination of physical strain may have an adverse eﬀect
on a human organism, e.g. leading to muscular dystrophy [17], whereas the amount of
processed information and stress may contribute to increased mental strain [18].
Research studies conducted by EU-OSHA have shown that currently a half of
employees considers work-related stress to be a serious problem. Apart from mental
health related issues, the results of stress experienced by employees include serious
problems connected with physical health, which are manifested e.g. by the circulatory
system diseases and complaints related to the muscular and skeletal system. The
specialist literature more and more often focuses on analyzing the eﬀects caused by
stress.

Methods of Research and Data
The research study was carried out using the originally developed questionnaire called
WAQ (Workplace Automation Questionnaire). The questionnaire contains four parts
with content-related questions, as well as the social and demographic data of the
respondents. Part one contains data regarding tasks performed in a given job, broken
down into constituent actions and the percentage of time they take within one month’s
working time.
Part two is aimed at acquiring information on the manner of performing the work
(manually, by machine, by computer, by decision-making), task complexity level
according to ILO typology (simple, moderately complex, complex, creative), require‐
ments regarding qualiﬁcations, cooperative requirements (from autonomous actions to
contacts with institutional environment), and the employee opinion on the current level
of computerization of the activities and anticipated changes in the time horizon of 3–5
years.
Part three contains information on Frey and Osborne criteria regarding computeri‐
zation bottleneck subdomains. The respondents evaluated the presence of the individual
nine subdomains in the activities they performed in their jobs, using the 5-item Likert
scale, where 1 = not present, 2 = present to a small degree, 3 = present at a medium,
perceptible level, 4 = present at a signiﬁcantly perceived level, 5 = very often and
systematically present.
Part four comprises employees’ evaluations of factors identiﬁed in their jobs, which
may cause a decrease in their mental and physical abilities or an injury and which may
lead to developing an occupational disease. Further on, the respondents also evaluated
a possibility that the aforementioned risks might be eliminated in case of the job auto‐
mation in the future. The respondents were also asked to assess whether automation of
their job in the future might lead to its liquidation. As for this part, the 7-item Likert
scale was applied, where: 1 = irrelevant, 2 = no impact, 3 = rather no impact,
4 = indiﬀerent (neither yes nor no), 5 = perceivable impact, 6 = signiﬁcant impact,
7 = powerful impact. The questionnaire was supplied along with instructions on how to
use the scales.
All the surveys were pilot studies. The studies regarding the job characteristics
involved the population of 373 employees, and 320 questionnaires were veriﬁed as
correctly completed. The internal coherence level was very high for the studied popu‐
lation, as Cronbach’s ɑ for the characteristics ranged from 0.74 to 0.62 regarding the
workplace.
The respondents were sampled purposively. 64.7% of the studied population were
women, 63.4% of the respondents were aged from 20 to 30, 42.8% of the subjects had
been working for 2–5 years (further 38.4% of respondents had been working for more
than 6 years), 61.6% had a university degree, 77.8% of the respondents lived in cities,
46.9% worked in the service sector, and 34.1% in commerce. Thus, the respondent group
mainly consisted of women – young city dwellers with higher education, with diverse
work experience lengths, working mainly in services and commerce. The information
was obtained from the occupational groups which will be experiencing the processes of
accelerated automation in future careers.

In accordance with the adopted research procedure, the jobs were divided into three
generic groups: jobs related to services, jobs related to production, and administrative
oﬃce jobs in all industries and sectors. This methodological approach was aimed at
verifying whether white collar jobs, which are the most aﬀected by the digital workplace
pressure, constitute a link between two kinds of jobs representing subsequent stages of
development according to Clark-Fisher three sector classiﬁcation, i.e. industry and serv‐
ices.

Discussion
The ﬁrst of the researched elements was ﬁnding the respondents’ opinions on the char‐
acteristics speciﬁed as work subdomains. The research results have shown a moderating
impact of white collars on the level of ﬁnger dexterity (FD), manual dexterity (MD),
cramped work spaces (CWS) and/or awkward positions, i.e. all the three subdomains
belonging to the domain of Perception and Manipulation. The fourth subdomain is
Negotiations (NG), being part of Social Intelligence (Fig. 1).

employees in the computerization bottleneck subdomains system (5-item Likert scale). Source:
research results
The research results have demonstrated an interpretation paradox, often found in
social science research. In this case there is a reorganization paradox, in which intro‐
duction of new solutions leads to the need for adaptive and innovative reconstruction of
the solutions used so far and for redesigning the methodology of actions. Progress in
software development changes the work organization in white collar jobs and the
communication system.
Work Automation and Psychophysical Hazards in Employees’ Opinion
253

Also, new requirements arise in connection with the need to agree on various aspects
of coordination and the roles of job positions in the work ﬂow systems. Therefore, the
Negotiations subdomain is of prevailing importance. The obtained research results have
demonstrated that as for the remaining elements, i.e. in the Creative Intelligence domain,
and also in Social Intelligence, service sector employees’ opinions set the leading trend.
The values of indicators for production workers show a reactive character, as they are
lower from 0.1 to 0.5 compared to the other groups. Only in the case of the Creative
Intelligence domain the white collars’ and production workers’ opinions are at the same
level. This proves that the people do not feel free to take creative actions, and it’s the
evidence of dominating procedures that force the employees to take a rigid approach.
Figure 2 presents the results of the survey on the current and future automation of
jobs and occupational risk. As mentioned above, the respondents were divided into three
groups reﬂecting the occupational ranges and specializations. According to the
respondent group working in the service sector which is expected to provide the highest
employment in the future, their work automation is currently at the level of 71.1% of
the average working time. The respondents working in production assessed the auto‐
mation level similarly – 69.9%. But the decidedly highest automation of work – at the
level of 81.4% – was reported by administrative oﬃce workers.

psychophysical hazards. Source: research results
The surveyed employees were asked whether the automation process would lead to
liquidation of their jobs within 3 to 5 years. The respondents working in services antic‐
ipate the lowest level of jobs liquidation over the set time horizon: 31.8%. A higher rate
of jobs liquidation is predicted by administrative workers: 37.1%. And the highest level
of jobs liquidation (39.1%) is expected by production workers.
254
J. Rymaniak and K. Lis

The study of the current and future occupational risks perceived by the respondents
shows diversity in terms of work automation process. In the groups of service and
production workers, there are opinions that there is a trend to reduce all risks in the
future: mental and physical risks, risks of injury in connection with probability of acci‐
dent at work and risk of developing an occupational disease. The administrative oﬃce
workers group, in turn, believe the trend will be maintained apart from the injury factor,
which is currently lower than the one expected by these respondents in the future. This
results from the more and more numerous injuries connected with e.g. forced sedentary
position at work, failure to provide ergonomic work stations, and the increasing occur‐
rence of physical injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome, tennis elbow or vertebral
column injuries.
5
Conclusions
This research study is merely an initial diagnosis of a speciﬁc state of opinions held by
employees on work automation processes and potential psychophysical risks, which in
the respondents’ opinion may arise as a result of introducing the Digital Workplace.
This article shows the main assumptions of the quantitative and qualitative methodology
developed for the purposes of determining the probability of automating any individual
jobs and occupational specializations. The results of the employee survey were presented
with respect to that.
The authors emphasize the need to improve the methodological solutions regarding
both the automation measurement and employee opinions analysis. It is also necessary
to note that the methodological proposals of theoreticians pertaining to some elements
such as e.g. creativity, refer to the examples of freelance professions and/or creative
professions, in which case autonomy and creativity are their essence. Therefore, the
theoretical recommendations may not ﬁt the other occupations [19].
The presented data indicate the leading opinion-forming role of service sector
employees within the scope of Creative Intelligence and Social Intelligence (apart from
Negotiations). White collars are a group which adapts and imposes new models of the
Perception and Manipulation domains, as the changes evoke the need to reconstruct jobs
in that regard.
The respondents in all the occupational groups involved in the study perceive a threat
in the work automation process in view of a possible liquidation of some of the jobs in
the future. As a result of the technical changes anticipated in the academic literature,
there will be a relative growth in the demand for highly-qualiﬁed workers and a decrease
in the demand for less educated workers whose work is based on routine mental and
physical tasks. Over the next decades it is expected that about one-third of all currently
existing jobs will be liquidated. Although the respondents working in the service sector
are the most optimistic in view of their jobs liquidation as a result of work automation
process, innovations pertaining to services will be the biggest threat for occupational
safety. This results from the lack of experience in the area of human - robot (machine)
interactions in professional services and it will require specifying legal liability for any
accidents e.g. in public space.
Work Automation and Psychophysical Hazards in Employees’ Opinion
255

The analysis of the research results has shown that employees in general perceive a
link between automation and reduction of occupational hazards in the area of mental,
physical, accident and disease risks. Robotics-assisted automation may therefore be used
in the case of work conditions that are too diﬃcult or dangerous for a human. Moreover,
in view of the population ageing, robots may be a solution to the problem of the growing
deﬁciency of physical workers.
Research studies indicate that in the near future the psychophysical risks connected
with occupational work will be a major challenge in the area of occupational health and
safety, as these issues have a signiﬁcant impact on employees’ health and the condition
of organizations and national economies. Surveying employees’ opinions with regard
to their feelings pertaining to work environment hazards resulting from work automation
provides one with a possibility to introduce appropriate tools for workplace risk manage‐
ment and improving the work safety culture.
It should also be noted that historically the development of new technologies brought
not only beneﬁts and new possibilities, but also threats and costs. It is generally thought
that the pace of changes is increasing and it will be more and more diﬃcult to predict
future changes, especially in the area of automation and robotics.

Abstract. This study reports on the accuracy of smartphone-based illuminance
measurement applications and whether they may be employed for occupational
lighting measurements. A sample of nine mobile phones on three platforms
(Android, iOS and Windows) was assembled and 14 apps were selected for
testing. Testing conditions comprised four pre-speciﬁed illuminance levels
(300 lx, 500 lx, 750 lx and 1000 lx) accomplished with three light sources
presenting different Correlated Color Temperatures (2700 K; 4000 K; 6500 K).
The results reveal extremely variable and sometimes large deviations from the
reference levels and suggest smartphones are not appropriate for use in occu-
pational lighting assessments.

Introduction
Despite of being mostly known for its visual functions, light also has biological effects
and plays an important role in emotional perception. Therefore, poor lighting condi-
tions in the workplace can adversely affect health, safety, and job performance. For that
reason, light is often measured in occupational settings and in case of inadequacy; it
may be improved both in qualitative and quantitative terms. Occupational lighting
needs depend on factors such as nature of the job, workers’ age, individuals’ visual
acuity, properties of work surfaces and general work area. International standards,
namely EN 12464-1:2011 [1] and ISO 8995-1:2002 [2], provide guidance regarding
lighting characteristics according to the type of activity being performed.
The most commonly assessed photometric measure is illuminance, which repre-
sents the amount of light falling onto a surface at a certain distance from a light source.
It is traditionally measured with a dedicated lux meter in lux (lx) or foot-candle (fc) [3].
This particular type of measuring instrument should comply with ISO/CIE 19476:2014
standard [4].

Smartphones are mobile phones with computing capabilities and connectivity more
advanced than regular ones. They appeared in the consumer market in the late 90s, but
only gained popularity with the introduction of Apple’s iPhone in 2007, which offered
user-friendly features such as a touch screen interface and a virtual keyboard.
According to Statista [5], an estimated total of 2.6 billion people will own a smartphone
by 2017. In Portugal, the number of smartphone users increased 89% from 2013 to
2016 representing 68% (6.2 million) of the mobile phone owners [6]. These mobile
devices have greatly evolved in the last few years and are no longer restricted to the
traditional functions of making calls and texting. The integration of different types of
sensors (hardware) and the development of many applications (software) turned them
into interesting measurement instruments with huge potential in many different ﬁelds
[7]. Their portability, ubiquity, permanent network connectivity and cost have attracted
software developers to use embedded sensors for other purposes.
The aforementioned facts raised the following questions: (1) can a smartphone-based
app be used for measuring light levels, and (2) in that case, will the accuracy be acceptable
to substitute a dedicated and calibrated lux meter?
Within the occupational environment ﬁeld, applications have been developed to
assess risk factors such as noise [8], vibration [9] and light [8, 10, 11].
There are two different approaches to measure light with smartphone-based apps:
some rely on one or both cameras while others use the embedded light sensor
speciﬁcally designed to measure how bright the ambient light is and then adjust the
display brightness automatically. Alternatively, there are small slip-on attachments for
smartphones, such as Lumu exclusively for iOS phones and Luxi with a recent version
available for both iOS and Android systems.
However, accurate measuring instruments are essential. While several studies on
the accuracy of smartphone sound [7, 12–17] and whole-body vibration [18–20]
measurement applications have been published, a single study [21] has been found to
deal with the suitability of smartphones to measure illuminance. Goldschmidt [21] has
tested seven mobile phones running on different operating systems (three iOS, three
Android and one Windows) and three reference illuminances (100 lx, 500 lx and
1000 lx) were set on a horizontal platform to test seven apps (three iOS, three Android
and one Windows). The author concluded that apps are not suitable for measuring
illuminance and lead the user in the completely wrong direction.
Furthermore, measuring instruments need to be calibrated against known standards
so their results can be trusted to have a universally accepted meaning. Although some
of the apps used by Goldschmidt [21] were possible to calibrate, it was frequently not
possible to set the value accurately.
This study sought to analyze the ability of smartphones to measure illuminance
accurately and to assess the apps themselves and the platforms used to host them.
Bearing this purpose in mind, a different set of mobile phones and applications were
selected and different testing conditions were set.

Materials and Methods
2.1
Mobile Phones and Applications
The smartphones’ sample was acquired among university students by asking them to
volunteer their equipment for testing. It included nine smartphones: one running the
Microsoft’s Windows operating system, three were on the iOS Apple platform and ﬁve
were Google’s Android-based. This proportion follows 2016 world trend of consumers’
preference in terms of mobile phones’ operating system: Android (66.7%) and iOS
(29.6%) were the leading platforms, well above Windows (1.4%) [22]. In Portugal, last
year’s 4th quarter ﬁgures were as follows: 81.7%, 17.9% and 0.3% respectively [23].
Table 1 presents a list of the tested phones’ manufacturers and models and respective
operating system.
Compliance with the following criteria was imperative for an application to be
included in this study: being able to report illuminance values; being available at no
cost; being highly scored by previous users. While Android and Windows based
applications rely on the phone’s light sensor to measure light levels, apps developers to
iOS system have to resort to the camera.
Table 2 provides a full list of the 14 applications tested. Four Android-based apps
allowed calibration to be accomplished. Although one app developed for the iOS
platform mentioned to have this function, as it did not work properly the app was
discarded. None of the Windows operating system apps presented this function.
2.2
Experimental Conditions and Procedures
All measurements took place in a black chamber to minimize light reﬂection and avoid
the interference of other light sources than those being tested. Light color appearance of
light sources, represented by Correlated Color Temperature (CCT) values expressed in
kelvin, was considered a relevant variable in this study. Therefore, warm white, cool
day white and natural white lights were obtained with two compact ﬂuorescent lamps
(2700 K and 6500 K) and one LED lamp (4000 K), respectively.

Different illuminance levels were achieved with each light source by changing the
distance between the lamp and the platform where smartphones and the dedicated lux
meter were placed to accomplish the measurements. Tests were completed at 300 lx,
500 lx, 750 lx and 1000 lx illuminance levels.
The order of CCT was randomized within each mobile device and the orders of
illuminance level and app were randomized within each CCT.
Before each trial, the illuminance level was measured with a Hagner digital lux
meter EC1-X, with an accuracy level higher than ±3%. These were considered the gold
standard readings.
The lux meter detector and the smartphones’ light sensor/front camera were placed
axially below the luminaire in the middle of a horizontal platformat 70 cm high.
Whenever applications required calibration, the process was completed with a
100 lx illuminance level, before the tests took place.
2.3
Data Analysis
Data analysis was accomplished with SPSS software (version 24).
The relative paired differences between gold standard illuminance measurements
and tests (apps) were computed using Eq. 1.

Where:
Eapp are the application readings (lx);
Elux are the values obtained with the dedicated lux meter (lx).
Therefore, a relative difference of zero would indicate perfect agreement between
the app and the actual illuminance value. The larger the absolute value of the relative
difference, the poorer the device/app accuracy.
Standard boxplot analysis was used to assess the variability in the relative differ-
ences across applications and phone models. Descriptive statistics allowed determining
operating system, application and phone performance.
Additionally, we performed Krushkal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests to assess the
difference in deviation values associated to each platform (Android, iOS and Windows),
across apps and smartphone models. A signiﬁcance level of 0.05 was adopted as a
criterion to reject the null hypothesis.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 presents a scatterplot comparing illuminance values measured using mobile
devices with readings of the dedicated lux meter at pre-speciﬁed reference conditions:
300 lx, 500 lx, 750 lx and 1000 lx. It is possible to observe the extent of variation in
measured illuminance levels (VApp). Moreover, the higher the illuminance reference
value, the larger the dispersion of the measured values.

dedicated lux meter readings (VLux).

Table 3 shows global descriptive statistics of the relative difference between the
measured values using smartphones and the gold standard values. The deviations from
the gold standard illuminance values were extremely high and smartphones’ accuracy
was much poorer than that found by Goldschmidt [21].
While the lowest measurements were nearly 85% below the reference value of
1000 lx, the highest reading was 439% above the 500 lx level. These results indicate
that smartphones do not measure illuminance as accurately as a dedicated lux meter at
the pre-established illuminance levels.
3.1
Operating System
The analysis of the relationship between measurement accuracy and the operating
system revealed that there are statistical signiﬁcant differences among mean values of
the relative differences of illuminance (v2 = 138.36; p < 0.001). Turning our attention
to the effect of the illuminance reference conditions (Table 4) it can be seen that
different platforms present signiﬁcantly different accuracy levels. While iOS platform
underestimates illuminance levels systematically, both Android and Windows operat-
ing systems over measure the true illuminance level.

Table 5 shows that statistically signiﬁcant differences were also found among the
operating systems’ performance in terms of illuminance measurement accuracy at each
CCT reference conditions.
3.2
Applications
When examining the relationship between app and measurement accuracy, boxplots in
Fig. 2 show a visual breakdown of the distribution of the relative difference between
gold standard readings and measured data by application.
Android-based apps presenting calibration functions (left-hand side of Fig. 2a)
revealed signiﬁcantly lower mean deviations from the reference values than those with
no calibration possibilities (v2 = 23.30, p < 0.001). Nevertheless, best mean relative
difference was 31.1% (Light meter app/Borce Trajkovski) whereas the worst was
50.8% for the Physics Toolbox Light Meter app. The fact that some apps have cali-
bration function does not necessarily mean it will be set accurately and it will render an
accurate measure.
As a rule, all iOS applications displayed values below the reference levels (relative
difference median values were negative) and presented statistically signiﬁcant different
performances (v2 = 21.01, p < 0.001). On the contrary, Windows-based apps did not
present statistically signiﬁcant differences (v2 = 0.40; p = 0.94) in terms of accuracy
but displayed values well above the reference ones.
Galactica was the only app running on iOS we were able to ﬁnd to match those
previously tested by Goldschmidt [21]. Apps are added and removed from app stores
on a daily basis and features and updates occur regularly.
3.3
Smartphones
The boxplot in Fig. 3 shows that, regardless of the operating system, phones present
different accuracy levels when measuring illuminance (v2 = 250.19, p < 0.001). The
best mean relative differences results were registered for Android based phones:

Vodafone Ultra 6 (2.27%), Samsung Galaxy A3 2016 (−8.53%). Still these are far from
being accurate as values ranges were 61.87 and 51.75, respectively. Turning to the iOS
platform, iPhone models 5S and 6S displayed illuminance values 34% and 41%,
respectively, lower than those of the lux meter while model 6 Plus readings were 15%
higher. The single tested Windows-based phone over estimated illuminance levels
repeatedly (mean relative difference of 50%).
Another interesting result shows that when using the same phone/app combination
across different illuminance levels, the values displayed by the app deviate differently
from the reference value. As an example within the iOS platform, for the iPhone
6 Plus/Galactica app combination, mean deviation values were 95.2%, 49.3%, 77.5% and
41.5% for the pre-speciﬁed illuminance values of 300 lx, 500 lx, 750 lx and 1000 lx,
respectively. This same phenomenon was observed when the same phone/app combi-
nation measured illuminance levels across different CCT values. Illustrating for the
Android operating system, when Huawei P8 Lite phone uses Light Meter app provided by
Borce Trajkovski, mean relative difference between app reading and the reference level
ranged from 183%, at 2700 K, to −9.1%, at 4000 K, and up to 204% at 6500 K.
These last results mean that a hardware/software combination does not present a
stable response to illuminance variations nor light sources presenting different color
appearances. Goldschmidt [21] invokes two main reasons for this abnormal behavior of
smartphone/app combination:
Fig. 3. Boxplot showing data distribution of relative difference between measured and reference
values by smartphone.
266
D. Cerqueira et al.

(a) Smartphone embedded light sensors and cameras do not evaluate incident radi-
ation according to the brightness sensitivity curve of the human eye in daylight
like dedicated lux meter do;
(b) The angle of incidence is not taken into consideration by means of a weighting of
the incident radiation.
Within the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) scope, visual comfort and
performance, safety and health are dependent on adequate illuminance levels. There-
fore, using smartphone/app combinations to measure it may endanger workers’ health
and safety.

Conclusions
Illuminance level apps’ incorporation in smartphones was thought as a viable tool for
quick, cheap, convenient and versatile light measurement. Unfortunately only one
study regarding the accuracy and the utility of these mobile phone apps was found [21].
Compared to it, our study includes different phones and apps comprising 552 tests.
Four pre-speciﬁed illuminance levels were created with 3-different CCT light sources.
Smartphones suffer from accuracy limitations for estimating illuminance levels.
The accuracy of illuminance measurement apps varied extensively relative to
pre-speciﬁed reference levels and CCT values. There was no deﬁnite or predictable
pattern to either lower or higher readings for the mobile apps compared to the lux
meter: smartphones displayed higher readings in some cases and lower values in others.
Therefore, it is not smart to use them to measure illuminance levels for OSH purposes
as reporting incorrect values have serious implications from an occupational
perspective.
This study has several limitations, mainly due to the small amount of devices tested
but students owning phones of other makes and models have recently volunteered their
equipment for further testing. Plus, only free apps have been considered for testing and
we are aware that some paid versions may perform differently.

Abstract. Skill development precariousness of disaster security management
induces an ungoverned society in emergency situations. It is noted a gap in lead‐
ership competence in critical scenarios, with a demand for leaders with proﬁles
focused on crisis management. The present work develops a discussion, to
propose a crisis management training model. In this simulated model, it is under‐
stood that it is possible to identify a risk scenario evolution, such as a public
building ﬁre, as well as to evaluate the operative group’s ability to cope with
crisis, in a leadership role or in an accident course. This work develops a training
model for leaders and performs a way of monitoring leaders’ performance,
according to which corresponds to procedures that are considered ideas and the
presented result at the end of the simulation, an indication of increased compe‐
tences of more assertive actions. From the training protocol implementation, it is
expected society will cohabitate in an improved comfort position, where leaders
are prepared to act in emergencies, in a relationship of cognitive knowledge and
emotional balance, for crisis management, in progressive stress stages as well as
in mass disasters.

Introduction
The accident is an event due to an environment of uncertainty, a chain of failures,
where it is necessary to assess the risk of its occurrence. The precariousness of skills
development in disaster management is a perceived gap when the emergency situa‐
tion sets in. It’s observed that there is a lack of leaders with appropriate skills for
critical scenarios, that is, the profiles of current leaders do not always meet the
demands of crisis management.
The appropriate behavior for decision making, in this situation, requires a multipro‐
fessional discussion, of the Manager, in the selection of professionals with decision-
making powers, and those who take care of the stability of the psychological functions.

Observing that the behavior of the person changes, according to the level of stress, to
which it is submitted.
These functions may interfere with the leaders’ procedures, in the face of an emer‐
gency scenario, that is, in contingency actions in the presence of progressive stress. It
is a technique that aims to be suitable for simulation training with the objective of mobi‐
lizing participants to immerse themselves in an imaginary scenario with scenes of crisis
that evolve in a degree of stress, allowing the participants to express behaviors that are
reported and discussed, with the objective. To place the emergency situation closer to
reality in the training environment and to provide the condition for developing a mental
map that assists in more assertive decisions when confronting a crisis [2].
From this technique, other contents for simulated training are elaborated, which
contemplate the presented decision making gaps, found after evaluation of the behavior
of the participants who performed the simulation in situation of progressive stress. The
responses to the emergencies reported allow for new moments of learning and devel‐
opment of competencies for decisions in emergency actions.
His explains the occurrence of progressive stress in a real-life accident scenario,
when scenes of the crisis occur in Industry (ﬁres, explosions), social accidents (terrorist
attacks, collective exterminations), climate change (natural disasters), when Contin‐
gency responses and mitigation of damages are required.
Stress has the capacity to provoke reactions that can intervene positively or generate
a lack of control of the operating group. In order to do so, it is expected that a leadership
will be assumed with the knowledge and ability to maintain group cohesion, determine
the assertive actions for the emergency and contain individual reactions that can increase
the risks in a position of convergence with the accident already installed. The volume
of an explosion, the ﬁre, extensive smoke, uncontrolled staﬀ, mutilation scenarios and
loss of lives, are confronted by the need for emotional control of the team and its lead‐
ership, for the assertive response to the emergency. The diﬀerent extreme of the expected
patterns, provoke strangeness and imbalance generating the loss of perception of
possible strategies to reduce the crisis, and admitting the existence of the extreme can
bring a better behavior in the emergency actions [3, 9].
The perception, attention and memory are psychological functions and must remain
active, within the dynamics of the individual in the execution of his task. Thus, simu‐
lation trainings with serial stimuli in scenarios of exhaustive crisis, can boost contin‐
gency actions in emergency. The competence to deal with crises can be developed from
the simulated ones where the reason and the action by impulse need to live for a better
route of decision-making.
Carvalho [4, p. 32] discusses the transformation of the knowledge acquired in
training and the professional experience of the worker, in mental maps as a way of
developing skills and thus, it is understood that decision-making more assertively in that
accident situation and worker’s expertise.
The perception of rules of behavior enables the development of competencies. The
observation and experience of real events indicate which the appropriate attitudes to be
taken. Thus, according to the group, one can infer about the existence of ideal procedures
for the treatment of the crisis. Thus, according to the group, one can infer about the
existence of ideal procedures for the treatment of the crisis.

The need to reproduce the behavior in procedure and this in training indicates the
technique of operating groups as recommended. The phases of the accident are translated
into training, leading the group to a positive safety performance, procedures are required
that can translate the training phases and their contents to the positive performance of
the team’s safety.
It is worth emphasizing that the worker needs the motivation to perform technical
trainings, and to put them into practice, it is not enough, therefore, to participate in the
training without the commitment that the event, and not to react properly, using the
learning when necessary.
To do so, it’s understood that motivating an individual in the workplace is not a
simple task. It requires skill and development of methodologies that provide, in addition
to technical and practical knowledge, stimulate the commitment of the responsibility of
preserving a safe environment, especially in the face of an accident scenario. According
to Ávila and Bittencourt [1], diﬀerent cultures can also trigger varied behaviors, diﬀer‐
entiated understandings, and consequently aﬀect the attitudes of the leadership and of
its work team. Class the diversities explains the need to expand the training methodol‐
ogies that best ﬁt those facing an emergency. In these situations, it is perceived that
dealing with situations of chaos simulation, repercussions on the most appropriate
behavior to deal with the real moment of the accident.
The elaboration of a mental map, is a methodological strategy, and as Galante [6]
explains, the strategy of interpretation and mental formation of ideas, knowledge and
appreciation of the movements of an environment in crisis, provides answers that can
better meet the need of the Accident and its consequences. Ávila [1], explains that exer‐
cise when it presents a high degree of tension, the stress limit of the group is observed
and discussed. From this experience, it can be observed in the situation of an accident,
the repercussion of better decisions, once the scenario presented during the simulation,
had the ability to promote progressive stress, arrive at the evaluation of behavior in the
responses in crisis situations.
To that end, Pichon-Riviere [8, p. 91] discusses a method for developing group tasks,
with results and considerations of an action research carried out for operative research,
where decision-making is based on a certain logic. In the dynamics of Pichon-Riviere
[8] we perceive points in common to a certain problem studied, followed by the analysis
of possible answers, without intervention of new elements, thus seeking a solution with
what is available at the moment this group technique, the coordinator, specialized in the
area of crisis management, is responsible for performing the simulation, with the func‐
tion of developing the activity with mastery of technical and practical knowledge,
communication and operability. There is a clear need to involve the participants in a
journey around the construction of an imaginary around a crisis [8, p. 92].
Among the stages of the didactics applied by Pichon-Riviere [8, p. 93] in the expe‐
rience called the Rosary Experience, the evaluation of behavioral development, indi‐
vidual and group knowledge, stands out.
This group technique brings to the discussion of the analysis of ideology, deﬁned as
a system of ideas and deliberations, when the man in possession of this understanding,
makes possible a better direction for his decisions.
Analysis of Competencies for Decision Crisis Management

The elaboration of a cognitive map for an emergency, describes ideas, feelings,
values and attitudes that reveal means, actions and alternatives for important decisions.
The cognitive map technique is a modeling, which adapts to occurrences that predom‐
inate qualitative descriptions.
It is important to understand the practice of building the cognitive map for decision-
making, when the leadership or group is questioned, the relevance of the situation expe‐
rienced, the involvement and responsibility in the face of the problem, and what response
should be demand in the crisis. These questions, which after analysis of the answers, are
revealed as important factors in the actions of emergencies.
Knowledge and learning can be observed in the evaluation of the performance of a
professional, in his area of technical domain. And skill, indicator of a person’s ability
to perform a task, and maintain self-control, which leads to emotional balance, even
under stress.
When the worker composes mental models, the knowledge derived from training
and professional experience, in general, the eﬀectiveness of the development of compe‐
tencies for the execution of successful tasks in the prevention, during the work routine,
as in the mitigation of an accident [4].
It’s hoped in this context that leaders and groups express their competencies to
streamline operational processes, as well as share with the group, through dialogic
communication, the development of the tactical and technical decision-making tasks
necessary for contingency actions.
This article discusses a simulation model for monitoring crisis management through
the development of competencies in contingency actions, with characteristics of
emotional control, knowledge and skills Accompanied by scenarios with special eﬀects
that lead to the participants, in the proximity of a situation A crisis, and its consequences,
motivated by the approach of facts associated with the manifestations of progressive
stress, contained in the simulated exercise.

Competency Development
According to Mathisen and Bergh, the lack of perceived absence of competencies in the
learning process is attributed in the present study to the behavior of leaders for contin‐
gency actions. Of leadership, including reinforcement of the knowledge of the task in
safety, the insertion of work psychology for follow-up, measurement of the level of
stress and the capacity to respond to emergency situations.
Knowledge of the organization’s policy needs to be presented to the new contractor.
As for the competence required for the performance of daily activities, it is linked to the
process unit and ﬁnal product technology [3].
The way to present scenarios of risk situations, is the ﬁrst opportunity to insert the
new contractors, the actions of preparation for responses to emergencies. Integration in
the context of security represents the diﬀerential of a company, in demonstrating to the
new employee, the security policy in the daily routines of the company.
The maintenance of the emotional balance depends on the quality of the interpersonal
relationships and is preponderant for the success of the actions in emergency situation.
272
I. Cerqueira et al.

This is a skill demanded for the team that acts in the emergency brigades. The contin‐
gency of accidents, requires the decisions and attitudes of the leadership and its team to
mitigate the damages caused by the accident. Thus, behavior to treat emergencies is
based on the emotional control of the leader in front of the group.
The selection of candidates with a leadership proﬁle and technical knowledge, and
the company’s policy of promoting continuous training are fundamental to the devel‐
opment of the capacity of a professional who is hired, as qualiﬁed to lead a group.
Avila [3] points out that competence is not always established for the person to
exercise his role of leader, but it is possible to develop the professional through training,
construction of new concepts and work in ﬁeldwork that develop skills and competencies
for crisis management in emergencies in a progressive stress environment.
The skills to deal with the crisis not only in leadership roles. This knowledge should
be part of the working group in all functions as values to be internalized in the facilities
of risk. The group that performs must understand and practice the perception of the
beginning of crisis so that the group acts in the right time.
Vazirani points out that personal characteristics, as well as motivation, are non-
measurable competencies proper to the individual’s behavior. These skills require
maturity, ﬂexibility, cooperation, autonomy and independence to perform tasks.
Thus, the simulation strategy can be applied and validated statistically from the
observation of behavior types, leadership styles, the organization of writing and the
quality of the discourse of the actors acting in the simulation. The events in the dynamics
must be interpreted making it possible to perceive the emergents of that group and how
to reduce the risk of installing the crisis situation. The observer, responsible for the notes
in the simulated training, perceives the actions and reactions during the dynamics. This
methodological procedure indicates the rules, biases, and cognitive gaps that in the
process of continuous learning feed the next action research.

Method
Table simulation is the technique that makes the research possible. It is intended to
observe the behavior of the participants and the discussion of the practice, which
becomes more “alive” when images are presented that resemble the environment of the
accident. Images, noises, gestures indicating the existence of panic after a series of events
that lead to accidents. The collection of data through the observation of the dynamic of
progressive stress elaborates a set of information that when treated bring results. These
preliminary results are presented to be evaluated as to the behavioral possibilities that
increase the likelihood of the disaster. Therefore, this is an exploratory and descriptive
scientiﬁc methodology, considering the hypothetical - deductive method. The method
is based on the perception of a knowledge gap, about which it formulates hypotheses,
and by the process of deductive inference, tests the prediction of the occurrence of
phenomena covered by the hypothesis.
This exploratory method makes it possible to observe the environment and its
components to understand the validity of the proposal and its variables, to improve the

technique, in the face of the favorable and negative critical observations generated by
the simulated participants at the end of the event.
The ﬁre scenarios evolved to raise the participants’ stress level, under the observer’s
notes, and shared with the actions described by the groups. The observer describes
speeches, dialogues, movements and expressions that determine the actions performed
for each presented scenario. It should be point that the presented scenario gradually
exposes situations that increase the tension of the participants. The reduction of the
response time, required by the activity coordinator, is a strategy to increase the agility
of the simulation contingency actions. The site of the accident was chosen as a public
building consisting of 10 (ten) ﬂoors, with classrooms, library, research laboratories,
cafeteria, administrative rooms, auditoriums and atelier.
Participated in the study, 10 (ten) people who circulate frequently in the building,
separated into 2 (two) groups. To conduct the simulation, a crisis response specialist
coordinated the event. The observer, with knowledge in crisis management, occupied
the position for notes of the occurrences of the simulation, and the groups chose a
rapporteur. The annotations made by the groups, following the coordinator’s instruc‐
tions, were delivered and discussed at the end of the year.
In order to construct the scenarios, in advance, the coordinator of the simulation
carried out a risk analysis in the building, to subsidize the elaboration of the scenes that
speciﬁcally reﬂected the possible challenges and contingency responses, which the
group was subjected to, in the imaginary confrontation of the crisis.
The dynamics presented in this case study was composed of 4 (four) phases with
presentation of the scenarios. After the organization of the participants, separated by
professions (Lawyer, Engineers, Economist, Administrator - researchers, masters and
doctoral students) and positioning of the observer, the coordinator of the simulation
requested concentration, attention and immersion in the activity, so that the scenarios
were incorporated into the environment.
A room with low light, space used to perform the simulated table.
For the demonstration of the scenario, it was informed that in the Building, there was
a welcome event for the new students, with the presence of teachers, employees and
relatives, including children and the elderly. This event was held in an auditorium with
the participation of approximately 320 people.
Scenario 01, is presented verbally, with image and sound. A loud crash echoes in
the simulated environment. The bang, according to the coordinator, causes vibration of
the structures and oscillation of the electric energy, leaving without lighting for some
seconds. Then, according to the specialist and coordinator of the simulation, a breakout
occurs and the room in this case study also remains for seconds with the lights oﬀ.
Therefore, it is observed that the groups mobilize in the discussions, dialogue, express
themselves and describe attitudes, feelings and possibilities for actions before the scene,
in a previously stipulated time of 15 min.
Scenario 02, the coordinator aloud, and to the screams of dread of a woman, warns
that people are running in panic in the corridors, guests have escaped from the auditorium
and that 08(eight) people are in the elevator. Smoke is already circulating in the building
and ﬂames are seen through the windows. Panic installed. It is known that the beginning
of the ﬁre occurred in the cafeteria, on the 4th ﬂoor.
274
I. Cerqueira et al.

At this moment, it is noticed among the participants, greater mobilization and
discussions. Participation actually happens, considering that the climate generated in
the environment, and the possibility of a ﬁre event being possible to occur outside the
imaginary, leaves the participants of the simulation tenser. In 5 min the report is ﬁnished.
The Scenario 03, it is reported that some of the parents went out in search of their
children, who went to the Cantina. During the trip, they noticed that there were many
young people with extensive burns of 1st, 2nd and 3rd degrees, fallen, with cardiopul‐
monary arrest, in the main corridor of the building. This presentation is given in a high
tone of voice and with the objective of generating the progressive stress, proposed in
the simulation of the case study. Again, just 5 min to describe the actions in response to
the crisis. For the presentation of the last phase, Scenario 04, is exposed the image of
the young people who died burned, intoxicated and trampled, in the ﬁre of Boite Kiss,
in the city of Santa Maria, in Rio Grande do Sul. Fire in the Joelma building, in the city
of São Paulo, which, although more than 40 years old, are strong and shocking.
Faced with the lack of passive and active protection of the building, of this simula‐
tion, the smoke and the ﬂames took up a large proportion, on the whole 4th and 5th
ﬂoor, it moves towards the 6th ﬂoor, at a speed that surprised everyone. Faced with the
panic, some of the guests, unobserved, climbed to the 8th ﬂoor in an attempt to rescue.
In a haughty voice, the coordinator places himself in the group, demanding an active
position from each group, that is, the coordinator explores tension behaviors in the
groups. This is the moment we want to link the real accident of the Joel building, to the
scenario of study, which determines the approximation of the imaginary and reality. In
this context, it can be seen that the participants of the simulation reacted with indignation
at the diﬃculty in developing decision-making actions in the face of progressive stress
scenarios, in a demonstration of inability to respond to emergency actions.
Communication is emphasized as a tool to follow the safety culture, in the space that
one wishes to promote knowledge and experience in an unexpected accident. In this
study, communication has fundamental participation in the dynamics of the simulation,
built by speeches, images, expressions and media. Discussing the body positioning of
the participants in the simulation exercise can be a response variable of decision-making
behavior when compared to exercises performed with participants in comfort zone posi‐
tion, supported sitting in the chairs of the simulation room. It can be seen in exercises
carried out, according to the experience of the specialist and coordinator of the simula‐
tion, that the standing position can inﬂuence the behavior of greater immersion in the
scenarios and thus generate other stimuli that can enable responses to emergencies
diﬀerent from those Demonstrated in participants who perform the activity, sitting in
the chairs of the simulation salt.
The hypothesis of the possibility of occurrence of diﬀerent behaviors for response
in the simulated table training, performed when the participants are positioned, standing
around a market, with an illustration of the scenarios, can be tried, considering the
observation of the expert and instructor of disaster simulations, responsible in this simu‐
lated case study, for the coordination of the experiment. For the analysis of the devel‐
opment of the simulation and performance of the groups, the material produced and the
annotated observations were described in a table. Afterwards, the products were
analyzed and the analysis was performed, for a qualitative discussion of the results

achieved in this study. Content analysis, a qualitative research technique, usually infers
the researcher, the analysis of the reports based on his theoretical and practical knowl‐
edge guided by his experience, intuition, competence, versatility [5, 7].

Result
O Group A reported on a sequence of ideas for crisis management, asking for action in
a comprehensive and managerial way, showing a greater degree of decision-making than
Group B. It was observed in a preliminary analysis that there was in Group B, A lead‐
ership with industry safety culture expertise.
Group B shows a sequence of ideas, with predominance of emotional decisions.
Some comments are not appropriate, as an account of the technique used in the manage‐
ment of ﬁreﬁghting and rescue. What can be understood by the professional routine of
the participants of the simulation. In the two groups, professionals from diﬀerent areas
participated, most of them Engineers, Lawyer, Administrator and Economist.
The sequence of stimuli to provide the participants with progressive stress was
enough to promote internal anxiety in the search for a solution to the exposed scenarios.
However, it is noticed that there was no complete immersion of the participants, a rele‐
vant factor for the accomplishment of a table simulation with the objective of expressive
responses and development of leadership skills.
Given the reports and observations, the simulated repetition with characteristics of
this case study, is considered strategic for the formation of a mental map. In this context,
responses to accidents can happen more assertively, with the possibility of emotional
control, in a real situation.
The following hypothesis is discussed: Should activities developed in the standing
posture promote a better dynamics in decision making? What about the sitting position,
it is understood that the participants of the simulation remain in a zone of comfort
(inertia), inﬂuences in decisions with characteristics of planning and logistics of
response to the accident? In this activity, the groups were seated, around the other, in
an armchair, in a posture, traditionally school.

Conclusion
A discussion, to propose a training model in crisis management. In this simulated model,
it is understood that it is possible to identify a risk scenario evolution, such as a public
building ﬁre, as well as assess the capacity of the operational group to deal with the
crisis, in a leadership role or in a course of one accident. In the measurable assessment
of all competencies, it is expected that leadership in decision-making in an emergency
will contingency the event and thus, damages will be reduced, since they vary in impact,
when there are deaths, social conﬂicts and economic losses. Acting assertively, will also
preserve the company’s image, removing a crisis, which results from an accident without
contingency actions.
From the implementation of serial simulation training protocols, considering the
inclusion of scenarios that present progressive stress sensations, society is expected to
276

cohabit in an improved comfort position where leaders will be prepared to act in emer‐
gency situation. In a relationship of cognitive knowledge and emotional balance, for
crisis management, in progressive stages of stress, as occurs in mass disasters.

Abstract. It may encounter some severe problems when simulating a crowd
evacuation using human’s data collected from other countries. Thus, to ensure
the safety of people in buildings, it becomes quite important to gather and
analyze human’s behavior and reaction in ﬁre, with consideration of different
culture backgrounds, behavior habits, different physiology and psychology
characteristics et al. In this study, we designed questionnaires and analyzed
human’s individual characters, cognition degree of ﬁre, sociological behaviors,
as well as daily behavior characteristics statistically in multi-ethnics jumping-off
of China. We bridged the gap between the human’s characteristics (such as
gender, age, education, job, environment cognition and toxic tolerance) and
human’s behavior in ﬁre.

Introduction
In the case of a ﬁre, there are a large number of casualties due to the unreasonable
layout of export settings, the crowd gathering, and the impact of panic [1]. According
to statistics, 40 cases of devastating ﬁres with more than 200 deaths happened in the
last century. There is an urgent need to improve crowd management methods and
design safety evacuation procedures. Thus in the past decades, more and more
researchers from different research ﬁelds have been devoting to deepening our
understanding of pedestrian and evacuation dynamics [2–6]. Pedestrian evacuation is
composed of a series of complex behaviors, containing both evacuation movements
and psychological reactions [7].
In order to make up for the shortcomings of theoretical and simulated research, it is
necessary to conduct various investigations to obtain the law of psychological and

behavioral changes in ﬁres [8]. As early as the 1950 s, American scholar Bryan sur-
veyed the behaviors of the ﬁre in Arundel Park Hall in Brooklyn, Maryland, and wrote
an investigation report, which started the early studies of human behavior in the ﬁre [9].
However, strictly speaking, studies about ﬁre accidents based on questionnaire surveys
began in the 1970s. The British FRS (Fire Research Center) and the US NBS (US
National Bureau of Standards, that is, the current US United States National Institute of
Standards and Technology) carried out a series of researches on the behavior of people
in the ﬁre [10, 11]. Since then, the method of investigation has been widely applied,
some scholars also used the investigation data to verify the evacuation model [12, 13].
However, we must note that the characteristics of human’s behavior in evacuation will
be very different under different regions and different cultural backgrounds [14].
A review of the literature suggests that studies of factors associated with human
behaviors in the ﬁre have so far focused predominantly on the central cities of Western
and American countries. Although it is widely known that evacuation procedures in the
jumping-off area are an important public safety issue, there has been very little work
done in the jumping-off area, particularly, multi-ethnics jumping-off of China.
The investigation in Karamay, a multi-ethnics city in Xinjiang province of China,
with 500 questionnaires was conducted. The statistical frequency of human’s charac-
teristics was obtained. With 395 available samples, 59.0% investigated subjects are
male. Moreover, the ages, jobs, educations of samples are widely distributed, indicating
that the investigated groups are representative of the local society. We also investigated
the human’s behavior (human’s cognition degree of ﬁre, sociological behaviors, and
daily behavior characteristics) during an evacuation. Using Pearson test, 30 groups with
p-values smaller than 0.05 were found to be related, linking the human’s characteristics
and human’s evacuation behavior. Then a multi-correspondence analysis was con-
ducted to analyze between these 30 related groups.
Based on statistical analysis of questionnaires, the study revealed some important
and interesting ﬁndings. Firstly, an overwhelming majority of elder respondents has at
least once ﬁre experiences or public safety emergency drill at the time of the survey, so
they are more familiar with ﬁre-ﬁghting equipment and tend to evacuate immediately
after the ﬁre alarm. Secondly, females’ knowledge of ﬁre safety and awareness of
unsafe ﬁre behaviors is relatively limited, and the majority of males tends to take a
proactive actions when facing a ﬁre, such as calling ﬁre brigade, attempting to extin-
guish a ﬁre, and trying to alert others. Thirdly, females are more likely to choose the
nearest exist while males were more likely to choose the exit they which they are most
familiar with. Fourthly, respondents with stronger toxic tolerance take the elevator in
their busy daily life more often, and they tend to observe other people’s reaction instead
of evacuating immediately after the ﬁre alarm. Lastly, herd behaviors that are docu-
mented elsewhere to be highly occurred in ﬁre were found not to be obvious in this
investigation.

Materials and Methods
2.1
Survey Design
Based on pedestrians’ psychological and behavioral responses in building ﬁres, factors
that affect human’s behavior and evacuation time were screened. The questionnaire
included four parts: the individual information, the ﬁre safety knowledge, the human’s
behaviors in ﬁre and the human’s lifestyle, accommodating a total of 27 topics. The
design of the questionnaire is shown in Fig. 1.

Survey Conducting
The investigation in Karamay, a multi-ethnics city in Xinjiang province of China, with
a total of 500 questionnaires was conducted.
All personnel in the research group accepted comprehensive training before the
survey, including research objectives, analytical ideas, methods and processes, quality
requirements, access outlines and speciﬁc requirements in the implementation. Inves-
tigators should use the pre-prepared speciﬁcations to instruct participants to ﬁll out the
form. When ﬁlling out the questionnaire, a quiet answering environment was ensured.
And investigators would inspect whether the ﬁlling methods conform with the
requirements or not. It must be ensure that the answers are correct and complete, the
handwriting is clear and the multiple questions are answered reasonably. For all
questionnaires, the data should be reviewed before entering the database. The ques-
tionnaires were entered twice and then were subjected to logical checks and correc-
tions. All recovered questionnaires were carefully preserved for future review.
Finally 436 questionnaires were recovered, and after excluding 41 nonconforming
copies there were 395 valid samples.

Results
3.1
Individual Information
In this presentation, the individual information included 3 aspects: socio-demographics,
health-related and environmental sensitivity. The speciﬁc ﬁndings are shown in
Table 1.
With 361 available samples, 59.0% investigated subjects are male. Moreover, the
ages, jobs, educations of samples are widely distributed, indicating that the investigated
groups are representative of the local society.
The physical condition of participants was generally well. More than half of the
participants had steady temperament and general sensitivity of the environmental
changes. As for the toxic tolerance, 45.5% of the participants is tolerant to environ-
mental toxic, and 45.8% of the participants did not have endurance to environmental
toxic. Only 5.8% of the participants adapted well to environmental toxic.
3.2
Fire Safety Knowledge
Previous experience of a ﬁre or public safety emergency drill has signiﬁcant inﬂuence
on pedestrians’ behavior and psychological change under the conditions of ﬁre. Those
who have experienced ﬁre and other emergencies will be more mentally prepared than
those who have not experienced similar incidents. They can better control their own
behavior and conduct more efﬁcient evacuation. For example, those who have par-
ticipated in safety training will have a stronger sense of self-protection and will take
more reasonable action after recognizing that a ﬁre has occurred, while those who have
not experienced similar incidents can not calm thinking which will lead to some
impulsive and blind action [15].

In this investigation, we focused on whether the participants have experienced ﬁre
and other incidents or participated in public safety drills. What’s more, what did the
participants know about the ﬁreﬁghting facilities and how could they recognize that a
ﬁre happens were also been considered, as shown in Table 2.

Human’s Behaviors in Fire
In this section, we investigated how the participants behaved in ﬁre, including the
individual behaviors and the relationship between the participant and other evacuees.
As shown in Table 3, evacuation indicators provided a lot of help for participants. And
people were willing to return to the ﬁre for their companions (71.5%), but they would

tented to ﬁnd other channels (81.0%) or move around (53.2%), and they were happy to
share information about new evacuation exits to any other one (83.3%). It means that
most pedestrians were willing to cooperate with each other.

Human’s Lifestyle
In this section, we investigated participants’ habits in their daily life. Results are shown
in Table 4.

Discussion
Using Pearson test, 30 groups with p-values smaller than 0.05 were found to be related,
linking the human’s characteristics and human’s evacuation behavior. The results are
shown in Table 4. Then a multi-correspondence analysis was conducted to analyze
between these 30 related groups.
Based on statistical analysis of questionnaires, the study revealed some important
and interesting ﬁndings. Firstly, an overwhelming majority of elder respondents has at
least once ﬁre experiences or public safety emergency drill at the time of the survey, so
they are more familiar with ﬁre-ﬁghting equipment and tend to evacuate immediately
after the ﬁre alarm. Secondly, females’ knowledge of ﬁre safety and awareness of
unsafe ﬁre behaviors is relatively limited, and the majority of males tends to take a
proactive actions when facing a ﬁre, such as calling ﬁre brigade, attempting to extin-
guish a ﬁre, and trying to alert others. Thirdly, females are more likely to choose the
nearest exist while males were more likely to choose the exit they which they are most
familiar with. Fourthly, respondents with stronger toxic tolerance take the elevator in
their busy daily life more often, and they tend to observe other people’s reaction instead
of evacuating immediately after the ﬁre alarm. Lastly, herd behaviors that are docu-
mented elsewhere to be highly occurred in ﬁre were found not to be obvious in this
investigation.

Abstract. Majority of the incidents and accidents in complex high-risk systems
that exist in the construction industry and other sectors have been attributed to
unsafe acts of workers. The purpose of this paper is to asses Human Factors
Analysis and Classiﬁcation System (HFACS) in construction accident preven‐
tion. The study was conducted through the use of secondary data from journals,
books and internet to achieve the objective of the study. The review of literature
looked into details of diﬀerent views from diﬀerent scholars about HFACS
framework in accidents investigations. It further highlighted on various sections
or disciplines of accident occurrences in human performance within the construc‐
tion. The ﬁndings from literature review showed that unsafe acts of a worker and
unsafe working conditions are the two major causes of accident in the construction
industry. The most signiﬁcant factor in the cause of site accident in the construc‐
tion industry is unsafe acts of a worker. The ﬁndings also show how the applica‐
tion of HFACS framework in the investigation of accident will lead to the iden‐
tiﬁcation of common trends. Further ﬁndings show that provision for the preven‐
tion of accident will be made based on past accident records to identify and
prioritize where intervention is needed within the construction industry.

Introduction
The construction sector does not have an enviable record or reputation and its Health
and Safety (H&S) compliance can be described as poor in comparison with other indus‐
tries [1]. Eighty percent (80%) of all incidents and accidents in industries has been
attributed to human error [2–4]. Construction workers may commit unsafe acts or cause
existence of mechanical or physical hazards that will result in injury as indicated by the
ﬁve dominoes model [5]. Unsafe acts are classiﬁed as either errors or violations as shown
in Fig. 1 [6]. Errors are major contributor to accidents while violations are less common.
Unsafe acts of workers has been rated high as compared to poor working conditions as
the major contributors of accidents and injuries in the construction industry [7].

Majority of accidents are due to human error and the accident can only be prevented
if management provides conducive environment for the employees to work. Hosseinian
and Torghabeh [5] argued that accident can be either caused by singular human error or
a combination of them as immediate causes of accidents; the combination of violation
and mistake is a very usual cause of accidents. James Reason’s model of latent and active
failures serves as a foundation for Human Factors Analysis Classiﬁcation System,
HFACS) [8]. In the current study human factors analysis and classiﬁcation system
(HFACS) taxonomy was used to assess how it may aﬀect the understanding of human
errors in construction sector. This paper began with the background of human factors
analysis and classiﬁcation system and human factors analysis and classiﬁcation system
framework. This is followed by unsafe acts of workers leading to accidents and preven‐
tive eﬀorts towards elimination of accident.

Research Objectives
The study addresses the following questions:
1. How do Unsafe Acts of workers lead to accident?
2. How can Human Factors Analysis and Classiﬁcation System (HFACS) framework
be applied in accident investigation?
From a discussion based on the key works in the literature. What it means when
HFACS framework is applied and what to achieve by applying it. The ﬁnal part of the
paper is devoted to a consideration of how accidents can be minimised in the construction
industry by applying HFACS framework.
3
Design/Methodology
The research method adopted was literature study from various sources such as literature
reviews of types of Human Factors Analysis Classiﬁcation System (HFACS) frame‐
works in the investigation of accident. Studies relevant to HFACS frameworks were
selected out of the numerous studies reviewed, through a rigorous process. Data from
literature review was analyzed and used to explain how to implement human tools in
the current study. Reduction in human error in the construction sector may contribute
in minimizing the adverse eﬀects on employees.

Literature Review
Errors in behaviour model are likely to be done by humans in diﬀerent environmental
conditions. However, humans are blamed just for their unsafe behaviour [5, 9]. Appro‐
priate strategies can be put in place to handle any unsafe acts of workers if they know
the causes behind the acts. The relationship between unsafe condition and unsafe act is
a one-to-many interaction. Unsafe condition can lead to many hazards and unsafe acts

of human [5, 10, 11]. Therefore, the need to protect workers from any hazard in the
construction industry has become necessary due to its labour intensiveness.
The HFACS is a general human error framework originally developed and tested as
a tool for investigating and analyzing the human causes of accidents [4]. HFACS, based
upon Reason’s model of human error in an organisational context, is currently the most
widely used human factors accident analysis framework [8, 12]. It is a comprehensive
human error framework that folded Reason’s ideas into the applied setting and deﬁned
19 causal categories within four levels of human failure [8, 12]. The HFACS is based
on the “Swiss Cheese” model of human error [6] which looks at four levels of active
errors and latent failures, including unsafe acts, preconditions for unsafe acts, unsafe
supervision, and organizational inﬂuences [8, 12]. HFACS is a commonly utilized tool
for investigating human contributions to construction accidents under a widespread
evaluation scheme. The HFACS framework enables organizations to identify the break‐
downs within the entire system that allow an accident to occur.
Several safety models have focused on human factor and proposed to analyze inci‐
dents and identify their causes [2, 13]. One such safety model is the HFACS. HFACS
is a comprehensive accident investigation and analysis tool which focuses on the indi‐
vidual act preceding the accident and other contributing factors in the system [2, 14]. In
depth examination of human error may contribute to accident reduction and increase
safety of work. Researchers have used HFACS to investigate the causes of accidents in
the construction sector [4, 12, 15] thereby reducing accident caused by human error.
Several researchers [12, 13, 16] have shown the extended applicability of the HFACS
to other types of industries for investigating accidents.

Background of Human Factors Analysis and Classiﬁcation
System (HFACS)
The HFACS is a broad human error framework developed by Dr Scott Shappell and Dr
Doug Wiegmann. HFACS was originally used by the United States (US) Air Force to
investigate and analyse human factors aspects of aviation. The HFACS is heavily based
upon James Reason’s Swiss Cheese Model [6, 12]. The HFACS system was originally
developed as an evaluation framework to analyze and classify operator errors in naval
aviation accidents and mishaps. Dambier and Hinkelbein [12, 17] have utilised the
generic framework of the HFACS model intensively in aviation accidents investigations.
The Human Factors Analysis and Classiﬁcation System (HFACS) is a general human
error framework. It was originally developed and tested as a tool for investigating and
analyzing the human causes of accidents with applications to construction industry and
other sectors [12].
The HFACS framework provides a tool to assist in the investigation process and
target training and prevention eﬀorts. Investigators are able to systematically identify
active and latent failures within an organisation that culminated in an accident. The goal
of HFACS is not to attribute blame but to understand the underlying causal factors that
lead to an accident [12]. HFACS was cited by Dekker [13] as one of the most powerful
tools for reconstructing human contributions to various types of accidents.

Human Factors Analysis and Classiﬁcation System (HFACS)
Framework
The general framework of the analytical HFACS mechanism for accident investigation
process as illustrated in Fig. 1 has four main levels: Unsafe Acts - this includes errors
and violations; Precondition for Unsafe Acts - includes environmental factors, condition
of individuals, and personal factors; Unsafe Supervisions - includes inadequate super‐
vision, inappropriate operation, failing to correct problems, and supervisory violations;
and Organizational Inﬂuences- includes resource management, organizational climate
and organizational processes. Any occurrence of adverse event can be prevented, if one
of the failures leading to adverse event is corrected as it implies in the construction
accident prevention [12]. The application of Human Factors Analysis and Classiﬁcation
System (HFACS) framework for accident investigation enables organizations to be able
to identify the breakdowns within the entire system that will lead to an accident. The
HFACS can also be used proactively by analyzing historical events to identify reoccur‐
ring trends in human performance and system deﬁciencies. Both of these methods if
employed in the construction industry will allow the identiﬁcation of weak areas and
implement target and data-driven interventions which will ultimately reduce accident
and injury rates. The HFACS provides a structure to review and analyze historical acci‐
dent and safety data. By breaking down the human contribution to performance, it will
enable the analyst to identify the underlying factors that are associated with an unsafe
act. The HFACS framework may also be useful as a tool for guiding future accident
investigations in the construction industry. It can be used to develop better accident
databases, both of which would improve the overall quality and accessibility of human
factors accident data [12].
Identiﬁcation of common trends based on past accident records, will support the
identiﬁcation and prioritization of where intervention is needed within the construction
industry. This implies past accident and safety data will be reviewed and analysed to
give a clue to the identiﬁcation of any failure before its occurrence. This will result in
improved human performance and decreased accident and injury rates in the construc‐
tion industry [12]. Prior to the implements any safety practices from another industry,
a deep and thorough knowledge of its own safety practices is vital [19]. Li and Harris
[20] opined that safety improvements should be focused on the start of organizational
climate and organizational process - to achieve the optimal beneﬁts from the imple‐
mented safety improvements as per construction industry.

Unsafe Acts of Workers Leading to Accidents
Accidents at work occur either due to unsafe worker acts and unsafe working conditions.
Abdelhamid and Everett [7] asserted that unsafe act is the most signiﬁcant factor in the
cause of site accident in the construction industry. Unsafe acts have been identiﬁed by
[7, 21] as follows:
i. Working without authority on the job can cause accidents since unauthorized
workers may lack the necessary skills, or unfamiliar with the job process.
Assessment of Human Factors Analysis and Classiﬁcation System
291

ii. Working at improper speeds, exceeding the prescribed speed limits, or unsafe
speed actions could cause accidents, e.g. workers who handle objects quickly
could slip and be injured.
iii. Incorrect use of tools and equipment, hand tools, power tools, and machinery can
also cause accidents. For instance, workers who frequently climb or stand on
rebars instead of using a ladder could fall down.
iv. Improper placing and stacking of objects and materials in dangerous locations
can result in unpredicted accidents e.g. a worker could collide with such objects.
v. Improper lifting, handling, or moving of objects may cause serious back pains,
e.g. workers who manually lift heavy objects without proper force-saving equip‐
ment.
vi. Failure to warn or to secure members out of danger is considered as an unsafe
act since many accidents occur because workers’ pay less attention to warning
or securing co-workers who are working under conditions with high probability
of accident occurrence.
vii. Using defective equipment and tools to work, e.g. a worker who uses a substan‐
dard ladder could fall and be injured.
viii. Annoyance and horseplay in the workplace such as young workers who play
roughly around the workplace could encounter unexpected accidents.
ix. Ignoring to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) may increase chances of
getting injured, e.g. workers without hardhats are more prone to getting head
injuries from falling objects equipment could raise the chances of getting acci‐
dents, e.g. workers who remove guardrails could fall down.
x. Working in poor physical conditions such fatigue, stress, or drowsiness could
also increase the likelihood of accidents.
xi. Leaving nails or other sharp objects protruding from timber may cause accidents
as workers who do not wear safety shoes could step on these objects and be
injured.
xii. Throwing or accidentally dropping objects from high levels could expose other
workers to sustaining possible head injury.
xiii. Working with lack of concentration, such as workers talking while undertaking
a job could cause distraction and result in an accident.
xiv. Working under the eﬀects of alcohol and other drugs could increase workers’
unawareness and cause serious accidents.
xv. Improper positioning of tasks can also result in accidents, e.g., workers on high
levels could fall and be seriously injured.
xvi. Improper posture for tasks such as workers taking shortcuts by climbing or
jumping from high levels instead of using ladders could result in serious injury.
xvii. Servicing equipment which is in operation, e.g. refuelling a machine without ﬁrst
turning oﬀ the engine could cause a severe accident.
xviii. Smoking, creating naked ﬂame or sparks in areas where ﬂammable materials are
stored could cause explosions.

Preventive Eﬀorts to Eliminate Occurrence of Accident
It is mandatory for all employers to provide their employees a work place which free
from any health related problems as stipulated in the OHS Act of 1970. Since Occupa‐
tional Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) enshrined the protection all employees
by enforcing the standard: through the provision of adequate training and education for
all its employees [22].
Protection of Employees from Unsafe Working Conditions. Under federal and state
laws, employers must provide a safe workplace. The enforcement of the act and estab‐
lishment of safety standards under the OHSA. The safety standards include provisions
for the storage of hazardous chemicals, equipment maintenance, ﬁre protection, and
personnel protective equipment. OSHA is mandated to prove protection to workers from
injuries, illnesses caused by unsafe health conditions in any working environment. In
addition to this, OHSA must also be able to recognize any hazards within the work
environment that may cause death or serious injury to employees.
Employers must abide by the safety standards within the working environment in
order to protect their employees from any unsafe working condition by:
i. Providing a working environment that free from any health and safety hazards that
may cause death or serious injury,
ii. Providing and placing a OSHA work safety notice in the working environment,
iii. Keeping update of a record of injuries, deaths, and exposure to hazardous material,
iv. Providing safety training to all its employees when desired,
v. Safety standards set by OSHA include provisions for the storage of hazardous
chemicals, equipment maintenance, ﬁre protection, and protective clothing [22].
Education and Training. Education and training programmes should play a signiﬁ‐
cant role in enhancement of safety in construction. It is also important to increase safety
awareness and change behaviour of employees [23]. Eﬀective health and safety training
can contribute to accident prevention in the construction industry. Therefore, the need
for education and training of employees in all aspect of health and safety in the construc‐
tion industry. Workers need to be aware of the hazards and risks at their workplaces in
order to encourage them to work in a healthy environment and safety manner [24]
because lack of training is a barrier. It is the duty of the employers to assess that the
working environment is safe for workers. No work should be carried out by employees
unless it has been conﬁrmed that such environment has the structural integrity to support
the safety of all workers. Tools and equipment to be used are also in good condition.
Employees should determine that they are safe before the use of any tool or equipment
on site [25].

Lessons Learned
The following are the lessons learnt from the application of HFACS framework in acci‐
dent prevention:
Assessment of Human Factors Analysis and Classiﬁcation System
293

i. The application of HFACS taxonomy will lead to the assessment of how it aﬀects
the understanding of human errors in construction sector. Since human errors has
been idendiﬁed as the main cause of accident in the construction sector.
ii. The investigation process in the HFACS framework provides a tool that assist in
the training and prevention eﬀorts.
iii. The HFACS can be used proactively by analyzing historical events in the construc‐
tion sector to identify reoccurring trends in human performance and system deﬁ‐
ciencies.
iv. The use of OHS Act of 1970 as a preventive measure for construction sector accident
minimization.
10
Conclusion
The purpose of this study was to examine human factors analysis and classiﬁcation
systems taxonomy in accident prevention in the construction sector. The review showed
how human error has been attached to accident in the construction sector. Unsafe acts
of workers was found to be the major contributing factor to accident. Proactive measures
to analyze past accidents records was achieved through the application of HFACS
framework. Occurrences of future accidents in human performance and any deﬁciency
in the system will be realized through the application of HFAACS to provide appropriate
preventive measures to be employed.

Abstract. Malaysian construction industry is crucial in the development of the
country towards becoming a developed nation. However, the positive growth of
Malaysian construction industry is being affected with high fatality rate. There
are four main elements contributing to occupational accidents in the industry
comprising of immediate factor (human and worksite) and underlying factor
(management and external). Human element is considered the most signiﬁcant
and obvious contributing factor towards occupational accidents in the con-
struction industry. This element is formulated by the four sub-elements, human
physical, experience, attitude and behavior. 13 residential projects comprising of
seven high-rise and six low-rise projects were chosen in Penang, Malaysia.
135 and 13 respondents were selected for questionnaire survey and interview
respectively. Attitude and behavior registered the highest mean average in
human element. Comparison made between high-rise and low-rise projects
respondents shown that there is no signiﬁcant difference in the perspective of
these two groups towards human element.

Introduction
Construction is a major industry in Malaysia and one of the economy sub-sectors in
enhancing other major industries in Malaysia as well as impacting national economy
[1]. It also plays an important role in socioeconomic growth through the development
of infrastructures [2]. Housing industry is essential in Malaysia due to its signiﬁcance
towards fulﬁlling social and economic needs.

Construction industry is known as a unique, complex and hazardous workplace [3–8].
Due to the nature of this industry, particular attention needs to be given to occupational
safety and health (OSH) aspect. OSH problems in construction are a global issue that is
rarely unique to a single country in this global market and occupational injuries and
fatalities are still occurring at an alarming rate [9].
Causes of occupational accidents and illnesses in construction industry are sepa-
rated into two main parts, the immediate causes and the underlying causes. A frame-
work of causes leading to occupational accidents and illnesses in construction industry
established from previous researches in this area. Human element is one part of the
immediate causes that is relatively easy to be detected during investigation compare to
the underlying causes. Approximately two third of the accidents that occurred in
construction industry could be related to human element with action/behavior and
workers capabilities as the main causes [10].
Human element as contributing factor towards occupational construction accidents
have been widely studied around the world. However, this paper will discuss the
human element issue towards construction accidents in the context of Malaysian res-
idential construction industry. Safety factor adopted at national level differ from one
country to another based on the standard practices for that speciﬁc country [11].
Different legislation, level of involvement from governmental organizations, safety
culture and construction practices may inﬂuence the impact of human element in the
context of Malaysia.
The main objective of this paper is to study the perception of local construction
personnel in Malaysian residential construction industry regarding human element as
contributing factor towards construction accidents. Speciﬁc objectives of this study are
(i) to understand the contribution of human element towards occupational accidents in
construction industry; (ii) to compare the perspective of respondents from high-rise and
low-rise residential projects; and (iii) to analyze the correlation of human element
towards four major types of occupational accidents in construction industry.

Fatalities in Malaysian Construction Industry
Construction industry endures high fatalities due to the high risks of accidents in the
workplace globally including Malaysia. Fatalities in construction industry need to be
controlled to curb the losses in terms of labor, properties and national development [12].
Table 1 illustrates the number of fatalities cases that were investigated by Malaysia
Department of Safety and Health [13–17]. Within the period of 2007 and 2015, the
highest number of fatalities recorded in construction industry were 95 (2007) and 88
(2015). In this period, percentages of fatalities in construction industries are within
28.98% and 43.38%. This scenario can best be described as critical and need to be
managed immediately. This data is also may not be entirely through considering that
there could be an element of occupational accidents underreporting in Malaysian
construction industry. Factual statistical data retrieved from the DOSH cannot indicate
the actual and absolute construction safety and health scenario in Malaysia [18].
Mechanism in solving this issue is being studied by respectable Malaysian government
agencies and researchers.

Human Element as the Contributing Factor Towards
Construction Accidents
A framework representing causes of occupational accidents and illnesses was con-
structed through work previously done by others in the ﬁeld of occupational safety and
health in construction industry (Fig. 1). This framework was used to study management
of occupational safety and health in Malaysian residential construction industry in
Pulau Pinang [19]. This framework focuses on both the immediate and underlying
causes of occupational accidents and illnesses in the construction industry. The
framework comprises of immediate causes (human and worksite elements) and
underlying causes (management and external elements).

Human and worksite elements are considered the closest contributing factors
towards occupational accidents. Therefore, all the items that were included in these
elements are under the consideration that they are causes that are easy to be identiﬁed
during investigation compare to the underlying causes that require comprehensive
investigation approach. External element can be considered the most distant of causes
followed by the management element. Management element deserved to be mentioned
speciﬁcally as one of the underlying factors as it brings another dimension of causes
compare to the external element that is wider in scope. In this paper, focus will
particularly be given to human element consisting of human physical, experience,
attitude and behavior factors.
Human physical is being deﬁned as aspects that involving issues related to human
body in terms of physical and physiology. Items that have been taken into account are
size, strength, and stamina [20]; body capabilities - tiredness, pain, drug addiction and
alcohol intake [21]; health condition and stress [22].
The second factor in the human element is experience that comprises of working
experience, knowledge and skill [20]. Safety knowledge has a major inﬂuence posi-
tively on safety participation [23]. This factor is being deﬁned by including items such
as competence, reaction times, information overload, inadequate experience, aptitude
for task and literacy/numeracy [22]. Experienced workers tend to adhere to procedures
and willing to report small-scale accidents [24].
The third factor that contributed to the human element is attitude. Human attitude is
among the main contributors to accidents in construction industry [25]. Hale et al. [22]
stated that issues that could be associated are motivation/morale, compliance, com-
placency, overconﬁdence, risk perception and ‘ownership’ of safety issues. Manage-
ment and workers attitude towards safety have a signiﬁcant impact on safety
performance and awareness [3].
Another important aspect of human element is the behavior that closely related to
unsafe act. Holt [26] has distinguished unsafe act as lapses, mistakes, routine viola-
tions, situational violations and exceptional violations. Unsafe act is an immediate
cause of accidents but it is not the basic or fundamental problems [27]. Lack of skill
was the main cause of unsafe behaviors at the construction sites [28]. Behavioral
characteristics of workers such as reluctance and complacency towards safety matters
can be related with ignorance [29].

Method
A total of 13 housing construction projects in Pulau Pinang, Malaysia were chosen.
There are seven high-rise and six low-rise housing projects that were selected
according to these conditions: i. all the projects were listed with Ministry of Urban
Wellbeing, Housing and Local Government of Malaysia and fulﬁll the deﬁnition of
housing development according to Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act
1966 - Act 118 [30]; ii. these projects are not mixed in nature and; iii. construction
commenced before December 2013.
Pulau Pinang is separated into two parts comprising of the island and the mainland.
There are ﬁve districts (Southwest, Northeast, North Seberang Perai, Central Seberang
Human Element as the Contributing Factor Towards Construction Accidents
299

Perai and South Seberang Perai) that make up the state of Pulau Pinang. This research
focused only on Pulau Pinang island covering Southwest and Northeast districts. This
study also considered the costs of the projects because Occupational Safety and Health
Act 1994 - Act 514 [31] stated that “The employer of the following class or description
of industries shall employ a safety and health ofﬁcer: (b) any work of engineering
construction where the total contract price of the project exceeds twenty million
ringgit” (approximately 4.84M USD). A quantitative method using questionnaire with
the support of qualitative approach of in-depth interview was employed.
4.1
Questionnaire
Application of questionnaire is to obtain data related to attitude, perception, believes
and choices rather than facts [32]. 52 respondents from low-rise housing construction
projects and 83 respondents from high-rise housing construction projects were involved
in this study. 50% of respondents were selected for every project. All the respondents
chosen are Malaysian citizen. The respondents consist of labor workers, semi-skilled
workers, skilled workers, supervisors, engineers, contractors and occupational safety
and health ofﬁcer (SHO).
One set of questionnaire was prepared consisting three main aspects. These aspects
are Section A (respondents demographic), Section B (contributing factors of occupa-
tional accidents and illnesses in construction industry) and Section C (the risks of
occupational accidents and illnesses in construction industry). Almost all the questions
were designed as close-ended. The questionnaire is rated using Likert scale of
1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) and Likert scale of 1 (very low) to 5 (very
high) for Section B and Section C respectively. However, only results associated with
Section B with the focus on the human element will be discussed in this paper.
Overall there are 45 questions for human element, 30 questions for worksite ele-
ment, 40 questions for management element and 12 questions for external element. The
distribution of questions for the sub-elements in Section B of the questionnaire is
presented in Table 2. Besides that, a scoring system was developed to help with the
classiﬁcation of the results obtained throughout the study [19]. The scoring system is
shown in Table 3.

For the quantitative study, descriptive and inferential analyses were utilized in
analyzing the results that were obtained. Firstly, for the descriptive analysis, results were
discussed in terms offrequency, percentage, mean value and standard deviation. Table 4
shows the overall suitability scale that was applied for the Likert scale in this study to
deﬁne the mean value results obtained. The reliability of the questionnaire was tested
using Cronbach’s alpha analysis. Results of the reliability test are being presented in
Table 3. In terms of inferential analysis, Spearman’s rank correlation was applied to
understand the relationship of the elements that were tested. In order to compare the
perceptions between the high-rise and low-rise projects personnel, Mann-Whitney U
was utilized. The hypotheses set for this analysis are as presented below:
HO: the mean ranks of the two groups are equal.
HA: the mean ranks of the two groups are not equal.

In-Depth Interview
13 respondents were selected for the interview. One respondent was chosen from each
housing construction projects. These respondents can be classiﬁed as personnel at
management level that responsible in making decisions regarding the aspect of OSH at
the construction sites. In Malaysia, it is optional to hire an SHO for construction project
lower than RM 20M (4.84M USD). Therefore, for project without SHO, project
managers were interviewed. Eight of the respondents were SHO and the other ﬁve
respondents were project manager. Theory thematic analysis was utilized in analyzing
the results of the interview.

Results and Discussion
135 respondents were chosen for the questionnaire and 13 respondents from 13
housing construction projects were interviewed. In this section, results of human ele-
ment (human physical; experience; attitude; and behavior) are presented and discussed.
The ﬁrst factor in the human element is the human physical. In this factor (Table 5),
four items registered the mean value scale of “Agree”, four items as “Slightly Agree”
and one item as “Disagree”. The most signiﬁcant items are “workers are intoxicated or
under drug effects”, “poor health condition”, “workers are under stress or tension” and
“suffering from extreme fatigue”. The conclusion is that the respondents perceived that
items related to physiological aspect are more critical. On the other hand, items related
directly to the aspect of human physical (“unsuitable height” and “unsuitable body
size” are deemed less signiﬁcance.
From the interview regarding this factor, health issues are things that need to be
given attention as it can contribute towards occupational accidents at construction sites.
It was also concluded that human physical does play some role in contributing towards

are classiﬁed as “Agree” and the other items as “Slightly Agree”. The most signiﬁcant
causes in this sub-element is “lack of knowledge and information”. Risks of occupa-
tional accidents and illnesses increase if workers have inadequate information and
knowledge [28]. Other items that are being perceived as signiﬁcant are “difﬁculties in
language and communication”, “unqualiﬁed to do tasks”, and “lack of experience and
training in conducting tasks”. Insufﬁcient training may lead to occupational accidents in
the construction industry due to lack knowledge, education and skills in identiﬁcation
of the accidents risks [25].
From the interviews that were conducted, most of the respondents stated that
insufﬁcient knowledge and information regarding tasks being assigned and safety
aspect contribute towards accidents and illnesses in the construction industry. Due to
the insufﬁcient knowledge and information, workers might have less awareness in
terms of OSH and lack of ability to evaluate OSH risks. It is important for workers to
be well-versed in OSH related to process, accidents risks, and prevention steps [29].
Table 7 shows the results obtained for the third factor. The respondents classify
seven out of twelve items being tested in the attitude factor as “Agree”. The other ﬁve
items are classiﬁed as “Slightly Agree”. Three of the most signiﬁcant items are
“workers do not prioritized safe working procedures”, “workers underestimate occu-
pational accidents and illnesses risks”, “workers are stubborn, arrogant, selﬁsh or

showing off” and “Workers do not prioritized OSH policy”. The results demonstrate
that workers attitude and proper implementation of OSH management program are
required concurrently. Workers attitude impact OSH performance in construction
industry signiﬁcantly [25]. Attitude was identiﬁed as the main cause of occupational
accidents and illnesses in the interviews. Workers neglecting OSH risks was highly
mentioned by the respondents.
Table 8 shows 11 items that were tested under the behavioral factor. All the items
produce mean value scale of “Agree”. The most signiﬁcant items perceived from the
respondents are “workers following wrong procedures”, “error due to lack of
focus/distracted”,
“unsafe

practices

that most of the signiﬁcant items mentioned can be characterized as unintentional error.
Through the interviews that were conducted, behavior is the most signiﬁcant in
inﬂuencing OSH level in the construction industry. There are mix responses in
emphasizing the signiﬁcance of unintentional error and intentional violation by the
workers in contributing to construction accidents.
Comparison of perception between high-rise and low-rise residential construction
respondents towards human element is presented in Table 9. The mean values achieved
for both group of respondents are very close and most of the results fall in the same
categories of mean value scale.

Through Mann-Whitney U analysis that was conducted, all Asymp. Sig. (2-tailed)
values obtained are higher than 0.05. Therefore, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected.
It shows that there is no signiﬁcant difference in perception between both groups of
respondents.
Spearman’s rank correlation test was utilized to understand the relationship of the
human element towards construction main occupational accidents. The relationships
between falling from elevation and human physical (0.417), as well as experience
(0.407) are the most signiﬁcant. Meanwhile a relationship between caught and trapped
in between or inside objects, machineries, or structures and experience (0.217) is the
least signiﬁcant in human element.
Human physical registered highest correlations towards falling from elevation and
falling at a same level. In terms of experience, the most critical correlation can be seen
towards falling from elevation, and hit by vehicles. Relationships between attitude and
falling from elevation, as well as hit by falling objects or structures are the most
signiﬁcant in this factor. Finally, behavior is the least signiﬁcant factor, registering
lowest correlation for ﬁve of the seven occupational accidents being tested. Full result
of the analysis is presented in Table 10.

Conclusion
Construction industry is an important sector enhancing the Malaysian economic
towards developed country status. The fatalities rate for construction industry in
Malaysia is very high. It covers approximately around 28.98% and 43.38% of total
occupational fatalities within the period of 2007 to 2015. The numbers certainly proved
to be a calling for all responsible parties in Malaysian construction industry to give
special attention to OSH in the industry.
In this study, four sub-elements were tested for human element as contributing
factor towards occupational accidents in Malaysian construction industry. The highest
mean values were obtained for behavior (3.61) and attitude (3.49). Behavior and
attitude are much related. These sub-elements are signiﬁcant components leading to
unsafe act by the workers. All of the sub-elements were categorized as “Agree” except
for human physical.
There is no signiﬁcant difference between the perception of the group of respon-
dents from the high-rise and low-rise residential construction industry. Although, the
risk of occupational accidents exposed in the high-rise residential construction is
potentially higher due to its nature and size of projects, both groups tend to have similar
perception towards human element as causes of occupational accidents.
In terms of correlation between human element and main occupational accidents in
construction industry, signiﬁcant relationships were established. This is aligned in ref-
erences to the major inﬂuences of human factor in causes of occupational accidents. It is
important to understand the components of the human element, in order to manage it.
Throughout this study, it can be concluded that attitude and behavior are the most
signiﬁcant sub-elements that require great attention while human physical is the least
signiﬁcant.

Abstract. Tailing dams are used to store mining tailings as uneconomic fraction
of an ore after separating the valuable fraction. Tailing dams are mostly
hazardous. Therefore, release of a large amount of tailings could lead to serious
and long term ecological eﬀects with very high cleanup costs. A literature survey
shows that the main causes of tailing dam failure are poor design, improper site,
irresponsibility and lack of control. To avoid of tailing dam failure awareness
about the root causes and the severity of impacts on environment and human
health is very important. This study is focused on a case to identify the causes as
a base for proposing some important safety factors to prevent failure of tailing
dams. The past experiences show that eﬀorts should be put on prevention rather
than reacting after the event.

Introduction
A tailings dam is typically an earth-ﬁll embankment dam which is used to store mining
tailings as uneconomic fraction of an ore after separating the valuable fraction [1]. Tail‐
ings could be solid, liquid, or slurry of ﬁne particles. Solid wastes are often used as part
of the tailing dam structure itself. Tailings of many mines such as lead and zinc, copper,
gold and uranium, contain toxic substances, which pose big challenges for the long term
containment.
Tailings dams rank among the largest engineered structures on earth. Among them
The Syncrude Mildred Lake Tailings Dyke in Alberta, Canada, is the largest tailing dam
structure on earth by volume with about 18 km long and from 40 to 88 m high [1].
It should be noted that tailing dams are designed for permanent containment. There‐
fore, design, and control during the construction and operation are very important tasks
to avoid structural failure.
Tailing dams are often built with steep slopes using the solid fraction of the mining
wastes/tailings thereby saving on cost [2]. In fact, preventing structural failure of tailing
dams is an important task in mine waste management. Generally these tailing dams are
vulnerable to failure due to poor design, constructing dyke by solid waste materials from
the mining operation, lack of standards and regulations on design, specially in devel‐
oping countries and high maintenance cost after mine closure [3].

The world tailing dam failure rate over the last century is estimated as 1.2% for 18401
mine sites. This rate is much higher than the failure rate of the conventional water dam,
which is reported to be as 0.01% [4].
In recent decades mining industry has experienced several tailing dams failure in
association with very costly outcomes. Some of them are shown in Table 1.

Shahid Azam and Qiren Li [2], have carried out a world wide analysis regarding
tailing dam failure. Analysis has been done on 18401 mining sites over a time period
covering last century called as pre-2000 (1910–1999) and post-2000 (2000–2009)
events. They could identify 198 pre-2000 failure events and 20 post-2000 failure events.
Number of tailing dam failures in the period of 1910–2009 are shown in Fig. 1.

As far as the regional failures are concerned, of 198 pre-2000 cases most of the
accidents have been occurred in North America (36%), Europe (26%) and South America
(19%) respectively. Looking at the 20 post-2000 cases of the sites under the study,
Europe and Asia are blamed for 60% of the failure events in this period. Table 2 shows
regional failure case distribution in the of the study carried out by Azam and Li [2].

As it is shown in Table 2, failure cases have increased in Europe and Asia during
post-2000.
According to the literature, the main causes of tailing dam failure could be overtopping,
weather (climate changes), poor management, and poor design and construction [2].
The main impacts of tailing dam failure are environmental damage, health problem,
human losses and capital losses such as infrastructure, agriculture farms and dam itself.

Tailing dam events which have been associated with signiﬁcant impacts on envi‐
ronment, human health and life and capital in some parts of the world could be consid‐
ered as a warning for improving safety criteria in tailing dam design and operation. It
should be noted that a large number of tailing dam incidents remain unreported specially
in developing countries. This could be a serious hinder for development of safety stand‐
ards and regulations in this ﬁeld.
This study is focused on failure cause analysis through applying Swiss Cheese Model
which has been developed by Reason [6]. The Model will be applied to identify the root
causes of failure of Los Fraile tailing dam, which occurred in Spain 1998. The goal of
the study is to ﬁnd the basic criteria, which are needed to design a safer tailing dam.

Case Description
On April 25, 1998, the Los Frailes lead-zinc mine experienced a foundation failure due
to sliding surfaces in the ground, leading to the dam breaking and releasing between 4
and 5 million cubic meters of mine tailings. The mine tailing, being acidic and containing
several heavy metals, poured into the nearby river Rio Agrio. The river rose 3 m, ﬂooding
thousands of hectares of farmland. This has later been called the Doñana incident. Rio
Agrio is a tributary to Rio Guadimar, which ﬂows through Doñana National Park. The
water eventually ﬁnds its way into the Mediterranean. It was therefore crucial to gather
and handle the waste as soon as possible. However, the cleanup operation took a total
of three years and had an estimated cost of €240 million [7].
The Los Frailes mine is owned by a Spanish subsidiary of the Swedish/Canadian
company Boliden. Boliden has, though not presenting a report of their own, stated that
the accident was caused by force majeure, and could therefore not be predicted and
Boliden could not be blamed. However, this statement has been criticized. In fact, the
problem with sliding surfaces in the ground was identiﬁed two years earlier [7] (See
Fig. 2).
The bottom of the dam consisted of marl. The chemicals contained in the dam reacted
with the calcium carbonate in the marl, causing it to decompose. Thus, the mechanical
stability of the soil was deteriorating. Boliden had recently been applying for a licence
for doubling the dam’s capacity. Therefore, one can raise hypotheses that the dam was
deliberately overloaded. Boliden has refused to pay any compensation for damages, still
referring to the accident as a result of force majeure.

Swiss Cheese Model Description
The Swiss Cheese Model as shown in Fig. 3, is developed by James Reason to analyze
causes that lead to an accident. According to Reason, each slice of cheese represents a
barrier or defense layer that prevent the hazard from passing through, leading to an
accident subsequently [8]. Example of barriers includes adopting a properly designed
safety system, proper procedures of maintenance and provides adequate training to the
workers. However, these barriers might not be functioning perfectly. There might be
weaknesses present in these defense layers and each of the weaknesses represents a hole
on the slice of cheese [9]. The weaknesses of the defense layer might be arisen from
latent condition or active failure [6]. Both failures have the potential to trigger an acci‐
dent. Latent failure is inevitable within the system and it normally exists due to the
decisions made by the top management who sets the goal [9]. There are two major eﬀects
of the presence of latent failure in the system. It either creates a working environment

313

which is prone to error-making condition or a permanent hole on the defense layer that
weaken the whole system [6]. Latent failures remain dormant in the system for a long
period of time before they combined with active failure to trigger an accident [6]. This
may be introduced at the time a tailing dam was designed or may be associated with
management decisions and policies. Active failure is due to the unsafe act committed
by people who are working on the decision or those who are working in front of the
system [6]. The unsafe act can be further classiﬁed as intended or unintended actions.
Intended actions can be categorized as mistake or violation whereas unintended action
includes slip and lapse [6]. The position of the holes on the defense layers is continuously
changing [6, 8]. These holes are located at diﬀerent positions on each defense layers.
Hence, even if there are holes on the defense layer, accident might not occur because
hazards might not be able to penetrate the subsequent defense layer due to diﬀerent
positions of the holes (see Fig. 3). Conversely, when the holes on all the defense layers
are aligned into a straight line, there is a potential that hazards could penetrate through
the layers and trigger an accident (see Fig. 3).
Fig. 3. Swiss Cheese Model with either non-aligned holes on the defense layers or aligned holes
on the defense layers (Adapted from [10])
It should be noted that most accidents (or system failure) can be linked to one or
more of ﬁve levels of failures: organizational inﬂuences, unsafe supervision, precondi‐
tions for unsafe acts, the unsafe acts themselves and in adequate defenses.

Analysis of the Accident

Results and Conclusion
Analysis of the case under the study shows that lack of safety culture, poor design in
terms of ignorance of interfere of soil and tailing material, improper site, irresponsibility,
lack of control, no monitoring and reporting have been the main causes for the failure.
These problems are mostly due to weaknesses in the protection layers of organization
and management. In other word Boliden company has failed to create a security base to
prevent the dam failure. On the other hand, the company has worldwide mining activities
experiences. Therefore, it was expected to manage the crisis. This accident and the
similar event, which occurs about one per year [4], could cause very harmful environ‐
mental crises. Therefore, more attention should be payed, in design, site selection,
monitoring, control, and ﬁnally eﬀective crises management to minimize the serious
impacts on the environment. The results from the Los Frailes tailing dam failure were
used to give general recommendations for integration of safety into the life cycle of
tailing dams. These includes:
• Design and Site Selection:
– site assessment (geology, seismicity, climate, upstream catchment area,…) and
selection
– hazard scenarios identiﬁcation considering heavy rain, ﬂood, blasting, earthquake
etc.
– analysis of anticipated dam failure impact (travelling path of slurries, downstream
land use and water use,…)
– selection of embankment type
– assessing interferes of soil and the tailing material
• Construction:
– Using right technology and materials
• Observation and control:
– regular monitoring of dam movements,…
• Improve stability of existing tailings impoundments by for instance construction of
diversion dams to prevent ﬂood inﬂow, smoothing of slopes, etc.
• Considering long-term safety and failure modes other than complete embankment
failure (such as seepage, dust, long-term erosion, bio-intrusion, etc.)
While embankment breaks are the most spectacular failure mode for tailings dams,
the long-term hazards should not be neglected either. This requires eﬃcient measures
to contain these hazards in the long term.

Abstract. The objective of this study is to discuss the Brazilian industrial acci‐
dent evaluation model in chemical and petrochemical companies located in the
metropolitan region of Salvador and to propose a transition model from guilt
culture to an environment where workers have equal conditions before companies
and can eﬃciently collaborate in investigations and implementations of counter‐
measures thus reducing the occurrence or recurrence of unwanted events, a just
culture environment.

Investigation os Accidentes and Blame Culture in Companies
The investigation of workplace accidents in Brazil is obligatory and supervised by the
Ministry of Labor and Employment through the Regulatory Norms (NR’s). NR-4 and
NR-5 regulate issues related to the investigation of occupational accidents.
NR-4 establishes the obligation to maintain, for some companies, the Specialized
Services in Safety Engineering and Occupational Medicine (SESMT), [1]. NR-5, disci‐
plines the creation of the Internal Commission for the Prevention of Accidents - CIPA
in companies, with the objective of preventing accidents and diseases arising from
workplace [2]. The CIPA was created in 1944, one of its functions is to participate in
the analysis of the causes of diseases and accidents at work and propose measures to
solve the problems identiﬁed. In addition to the Norms of the Ministry of Labor and
Employment, the legislation also provides that any workplace accident or occupational
disease must be reported by the company to the National Social Security Institute
(INSS), under penalty of ﬁne in case of omission. The instrument of communication to
the INSS is the Communication of Accident of Work – CAT.
In Brazil, in addition to the Federal Constitution, the amount of laws that protect the
worker is extensive. The eﬀectiveness of this legal protection is hampered by precarious

supervision, as well as by the lack of adaptation to the reality of the dynamics of labor
relationships. The importance of accident prevention and investigation may seem
obvious, but in practice failures as inadequate methods of analysis and prevention,
compromise the representativeness of results [3].
In the investigations carried out by Brazilian companies, the understanding of the
accident predominates as a simple event, originated from the contribution of a few
causes, chained in a linear and deterministic manner, favoring individual behavior and
violation of safety norms [4].
Criticizing the approach to the cause of accidents, Hollnagel [5] argues that the
occurrence of an accident is related to the existence of a number of coincident factors,
at a given moment. The explanation of the accident is constructed through the analysis
of the set of factors and their conditions.
It is necessary to take into account the multiplicity of factors involved and the
possible relationships between them, seeking to reveal important conditions for preven‐
tive actions. The observation of the scenario, the reconstruction of the facts, the analysis
and appropriate treatment of the information, are fundamental for the implementation
and follow-up of preventive and corrective actions. Such actions are important to
strengthen the safety culture and appreciation of the employee. On the other hand, iden‐
tifying the professional involved in an accident for the purpose of assigning him the fault
and responsibility for the damages caused does not contribute to the reduction of
accidents.
In assigning responsibility to the employee, the company seeks to restrict the scope
of accountability, avoiding its linkage to higher hierarchical levels. This reduces the size
weight of the consequences and responsibility of the event for the company. It also
reduces demands on future labor lawsuits and avoids damages to the company’s image.
The worker found guilty is accused of not following security procedures, not devoting
himself to training received, been reckless in carrying out the task. The company, on the
other hand, considers that it has provided all the means to carry out the work in an
absolutely adequate and safe environment and conditions. Regarding the legal aspect of
liability for workplace accidents, Brazilian law provides that the employer may be held
liable in the civil, criminal, social security and labor courts.
In the civil area there is an obligation of indemniﬁcation for moral damages and/or
material [6]. The employer, however, may be exempted from the responsibility of
compensating the victim, in the event of his/her exclusive fault, as established in
Brazilian law and jurisprudence [7]. In the criminal sphere, the employer may suﬀer
penalties such as restriction of rights and deprivation of liberty. The company may be
punished through its partners and directors, responsible for management [8].
In the social security area there is an obligation of the employer to contribute, relative
to its employees, to the Social Security service [9]. With regards the labor area, the
employer is responsible for maintaining the stability of the injured employee for a period
of 12 months after the cessation of the accidental sickness aid.

Does Human Error Reveal or Hide the True Causes
of Accidentes?
Security management, centered on the direct relationship between human error and
workplace accidents, despite many criticisms, seems to be suﬃciently entrenched,
requiring not only discourse, but technical and behavioral changes. With this posture,
important aspects of accidents are no longer assessed or evaluated superﬁcially. For
example, problems or malfunctions in systems related to the execution of the task, whose
design and management, originate in the company itself, can not be properly analyzed
and can lead to accidents.
For Reason [10] human error must be understood as a consequence rather than as a
cause of accidents. This understanding opens up an opportunity for an extension of the
horizon of the accident evaluation, allowing a preventive gain.
Alongside the technical questions regarding production processes and their barriers
to prevention and mitigation of failures, people’s issues can not be overlooked. For Ávila
[11] the industry should expand its analysis of near accidents and accidents, contem‐
plating social and leadership aspects in the process of human error prevention. Develop
skills related to work activities, identify and analyze failures under various aspects,
including behavioral is important in accident prevention. Llory [12] recognizes the
subjective dimension in accidents at both the individual and the organizational level, in
the horizontal and hierarchical relationships historically established in the work
environment.
Diﬀerences in performance in the execution of tasks are situations that generate
opportunities for errors, which in turn, may or may not lead to consequences that lead
to accidents. An individual who performs a task more than once will not do so in exactly
the same way, this variation stems from the individual’s interactions with systems and
the intrinsic variability of people’s behavior. The choice of action or omission behavior
based on received information is a cognitive process inﬂuenced by factors such as:
training, motivation, humor, stress, technical knowledge, among others, of-sending a
position of the performer.
The human error happens when the limit of acceptability of the system is exceeded
by action or omission in the execution of the task. This condition results in disturbances
in the system that have the potential to cause accidents, depending on the speciﬁc char‐
acteristics of each system such as complexity, process protection barriers, among others.
From the point of view of human error, the challenge for companies security manage‐
ment is to minimize its likelihood of occurrence at all levels of consequences, from
almost accident to workplace accidents.
If human error is identiﬁed in investigations as the main cause of accidents, what are
these companies doing to minimize this fact? What are the factors directly associated
with human error that contribute to the occurrence of almost accidents, and accidents in
these companies?

Methodology
The research considered the hypothesis that the blame culture model prevails in the
investigation of accidents in the chemical, petrochemical and oil industries located in
the metropolitan region of Salvador, northeastern Brazil, and that changes are needed
to reduce number of accidents. The investigation followed the steps described in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1. Steps of the methodology
In order, to collect the survey data, questionnaires were applied and semi-structured
interviews were conducted with four professionals working in the areas of safety, occu‐
pational health and the environment of medium- and large-sized companies.
Each of these professionals has at least 10 years of experience in their respective
areas, in leadership positions and work in companies considered to be high risk. These
companies work under severe process conditions such as high pressures, handling and
storage of toxic or ﬂammable substances.
The objective was to construct a ﬁrst perception about guilt in the accident evalua‐
tions carried out by the companies surveyed and the elaboration of a preliminary guilt
model, based on the results obtained. From the preliminary model of guilt built, the
subsequent step was the proposal of a transition model from blame culture to collabo‐
rative culture.
The interview and questionnaire elaborated were formatted in blocks of questions
with the purpose of evaluating: the existence of a security policy in the company, the
commitment of the top management with this policy, the eﬀective investments in

security, the accomplishment and adequacy of the training in Safety and its periodic
recycling, the existence and adequacy of operational procedures, the systematic inves‐
tigation of accidents considering technical aspects and human factors, the consequences
for the employee involved in an accident at work, the communication of accidents within
the company as learning tool.

Analysis and Discussion
The interviewees were referred to as: interviewee 1, has 20 years of experience in the
area of security, acts as coordinator of safety, health and environment, in chemical
company; The interviewee 2 has 10 years of experience in the area of security, acts as
production coordinator, in a chemical handling and storage company; The interviewee
3 has 20 years of experience in the security area, acts as security coordinator, in a chem‐
ical company producing pigments for paints; The interviewee 4 has 22 years of experi‐
ence in the area of security, acts as a security engineer and environment in oil company.
All companies have a health, safety and environmental policy. For all those inter‐
viewed, job security is a priority in the goals, investments and execution of tasks in the
company. The interviewee of the company 1 also informed that this priority is recent in
the last 3 years, and due to the change in the control of the company, previously
belonging to the ﬁnancial area, did not prioritize investment in occupational safety.
All companies reported advising the performer of the task, so in doubt as to technical
or safety issues, not perform a task and should report the fact to their supervisor.
Company 1 interviewee reported that the employee awareness process is slow and
diﬃcult since it is a behavior change introduced by the new manager group of the
company. All respondents agree that there is an excess of procedures that make it diﬃcult
and confusing to perform tasks rather than facilitating their execution.
Regarding training, companies have reported that they seek to ﬁrst meet the legal
requirements and then their internal programs. Some of the internal programs are based
on corporate standards, in the cases omitted from the Brazilian legislation or where it is
less restrictive. The interviewee 4 reported that his company requires and supervises the
contractors regarding the performance of the training. Interviewee 1 reported that he is
still adjusting the period of some trainings. It is observed that although all companies
train their employees to carry out risky tasks, there is a lack of conﬁdence regarding the
adequacy of the training, recycling and updates regarding eventual changes in the
process, equipment or other that may impact adversely aﬀect safety.
As for accident investigation, all companies have formal procedures in place. The
interviewee 1 attributed the diﬃculty in the investigation of accidents to the company’s
fragile safety culture, aimed at punishing guilty parties. Respondent 3 stated that there
were no diﬃculties in the investigation of accidents in his company and credited this
fact to his experience and the experience of the investigation team. Interviewee 4
reported diﬃculties in investigating accidents resulting from excessive bureaucratic
demands internal to the company such as the involvement of several hierarchical levels
in near accidents, slowing the investigative process. The reports make clear problems
that compromise the eﬀectiveness of the investigative process and contribute to the
322
C. Fragoso et al.

prevalence of culture of guilty. It is observed the direction of the investigation only for
the main event, neglecting the set of circumstances and factors related to the accident
and its contributions. The bureaucratic hurdles cited by the interviewee 4 not only
discourage research but foster the omission of important facts and information. The
omission of these facts leads to inertia about situations of near accidents and deviations,
hindering the prevention of potential future accidents.
All companies have formal training actions on the factors indicated as the cause of
the accidents, but those involved in the accidents are allowed to follow the preventive
and corrective actions arising from the investigation. Without an eﬀective incentive
policy of the company, this monitoring proves to be unfeasible when returning those
involved in the accident to the routine of stressful work.
Three interviewees reported that human factors are considered in the investigation
as possible causes of accidents except the interviewee 4 which suggests that investigation
should be limited to technical issues. In his opinion, it is up to the medical service of the
company to evaluate the physical and psychological conditions of the worker. This
positioning suggests a dissociation of the individual’s psychic and physical conditions,
devaluing stress, fatigue, personal problems and others that directly impact the attention
and performance of the task.
The interviewees aﬃrmed the importance of identifying those involved in accidents
to reorient them, but they admit to use the accident indicators as a form of evaluation of
the employees’ performance. Those found guilty of accidents can be punished with
warnings and even with dismissal. This approach may result in embarrassment, ﬁnancial
discouragement, and omission of information. This fact creates a non-collaborative
environment in the prevention and correction of accidents or near accidents.
Human error was pointed out by all interviewees as the main cause of accidents in
companies, followed by lack of training or inadequate training. Considering that all
interviewees reported that companies have investments in training, the way of applying
these resources needs to be reviewed. The eﬀectiveness of the training is related to a
competent instructor, clear language and content relevant to the objective. Also impor‐
tant are the use of learning veriﬁcation tools and periodic recycling.
The interviewees aﬃrmed the importance of identifying those involved in accidents.
Figure 2 represents the relationships between the agents considered as main in the
construction of guilt of the victim in workplace accidents, based on the perception
acquired with the research carried out.
The main entities involved in the employment relationship are: Company, Worker,
State and Society, forming a system of interrelationships. Inﬂuencing the interactions
between these, external factors such as social aspects, have local or global reﬂexes,
economic aspects can favor certain activities, to the detriment of others. They also exert
pressure on the system, the geopolitical aspects of a particular region that provide
productive activity and cultural interactions. The emergence of new technologies brings
the breakdown of paradigms and causes changes in technique and behavior.
Analyzing the relations between the State and the other entities it is observed that in
regard to the company, the society and the worker these relations are imposed by force
of law. However, the worker, by legal principle, is considered as the most vulnerable

323

side of the labor relationship, and it is up to the State to protect it as a way of guaranteeing
balance and justice in the relationship.
The State receives from the company the rendering of accounts of the legal obliga‐
tions. The latter demands licenses and permissions of operation and modiﬁcations in its
processes. Society demands the State to fulﬁll its role of monitoring and fostering social
welfare.
In its interactions with the employee, the company establishes requirements for
behavior patterns, meeting performance expectations, adopting its safety culture, quan‐
tity and quality of results.
The company encourages society to consume goods and services produced by it.
Society demands the company to meet its needs, through consumer goods and a respon‐
sible attitude on environmental issues.
In relation to the worker, the society demands for a professional and ﬁnancial rise
as well as for the participation in the social initiatives. The employee, in turn, expects
the company to recognize by his work and accept as a member from society.
The worker demands the State to see corrected eventual injustices and does it through
judicial actions and through the support of the unions. The slowness of the Brazilian
justice system and the risk of being dismissed discourages the worker who fails to
communicate situations of signiﬁcant risk.
Figure 3 represents the model of relationships in the process of transition from blame
culture to collaborative culture. Relations between the State, Company, Worker and
Society are perfected, intensiﬁed and new interactions come into existence. In order to
simplify the representation of these associations, in Fig. 3, only the new relations are
presented, however those present in Fig. 2 remain. The objective is to create a conﬁdent

The worker, supported or not by society (class organ), seeks the State’s action to
implement legal measures with the company, in such a way that it develops a more
transparent and integrated relationship with the worker. In this way, enabling the worker
to have the conﬁdence and security to participate actively in the investigation processes
of accidents. In this environment, it will be possible to widen the scope of the investi‐
gation to consider the possible existence of human error as a fact of multiple origin, not
as a personiﬁed aspect.

Conclusion
The presented results allow to conclude that imputation of the guilt to the victim of
workplace accident, feeds a process of impunity. In Brazil, this process is favored by
the fact that the legal system excludes civil or criminal reparations, when the accidents
occur due to “the victim’s” exclusive fault.
Even in companies that consider their management systems consolidated and eﬃ‐
cient, there is a reactive attitude in the investigation of accidents, blocking communi‐
cation with the worker, which starts to omit information for fear of being punished. The
involvement of top management with the prevention and reduction of accidents must be

325

evident for all workers in order to support the work performed by the other hierarchical
levels.
The current model of accident investigation adopted by the companies surveyed is
based on guilt and hinders behavior changes and attitudes that produce eﬀective trans‐
formations. These transformations are fundamental for a participative security manage‐
ment, which favors the establishment of cooperative relations and solidarity in the work.

Abstract. The aim of the present study is to diagnosis, assess and present
prevention procedures of electrocuting and burning risk, taking as a case study
electrocuting and burning situations in an Algerian setting “INFRAFER” spe-
cialized in the production of railway concrete sleepers, based in Oran. All the
workers of the welding and cutting workshop (N = 38) participated in the study.
ILO/IEA ergonomic checkpoints were used for the diagnostic of electrocution
and burning risks. The Methodology for Analyzing System Failures (MADS)
approach was used to assess the risk of electrocuting and burning. The study
revealed the following results: (1) a Constant frequency of electrocuting and
burning risk facing the workers of the workshop; (2) a strong dose of exposure
to risk; (3) a high level of exposure to risk; (4) the risk of electrifying and
burning has serious impact but without complications; (5) the level of seri-
ousness calls for rapid intervention. By identifying the priority level, the present
study recommended that “collective protection strategy” is the appropriate
action to prevent this category of risks.

Introduction
According to the statistics of International Labor Organization
[1], occupational
accidents is a universal problem, for it has exceeded 317 million accidents annually,
causing more than 2.3 million deaths per year. Occupational risks are multiple in
modern society, their causes, types and consequences are multiple too, covering every
human activity. One of which is electrical accidents, as electricity is an integral part of
modern society, its occupational use is inevitable. But failure to comply with proper
rules of use and regulations in dealing with electric installations can be of fatal con-
sequences, beside material losses, injuries, etc., particularly among electric utility
personnel. This professional category have additional risk since they work with both
high-voltage and high-current equipment, according to Fordyce et al. [2]. Electric
accidents are the most fatal of all kind of accidents as it is documented by statistics

word-wide [2–7]. Electric injuries result from electrical explosions, ﬂashes or direct
contact with electrical current [2].
Electric risks in Europe are present in almost every profession according to the
European national accident registries [4], in the USA, electrocution is the ﬁfth leading
cause of occupational injury death in the United States [5]. Although the data [6]
indicate that progress continues to be made in reducing the overall number of electrical
injuries, there is more work yet to be done, as has been pointed out by Cawley and
Brenner [6]. The highest proportions of fatal occupational electrocutions in the United
states have occurred among those employed in the electrical trades and in the con-
struction and manufacturing industries [7].
The situation of occupational safety and health in developing countries is still
lagging behind as compared to developed countries. Despite the efforts to limit
occupational risks and to promote occupational health and wellbeing in developing
countries, the situation of occupational risks is alarming. Although, industrialization
has given a signiﬁcant impact in terms of income distributions and quality of life, but it
resulted in increasing number of accidents at workplace [8]. According to Noor et al.,
the high accident rate in Malaysian manufacturing industries is due to non-compliance
with occupational safety and health requirements and lack of safety culture.
Electricity is recognized as a serious workplace hazard, exposing employees to
electric shock, electrocution, burns, ﬁres, and explosions. Burning and electrocution
hazards are well spread among professions dealing with electricity and electrical
equipment [9]. In their study of occupational hazards awareness and utilization of
safety measures among welders in Nigeria, Sabitu et al. [10] concluded that the level of
awareness of occupational hazards was high among the profession of welders, while
their utilization of protective measures against electricity hazards was sub optimal. In a
Ghanaian population, Agbenorku et al. [11] noticed an increase in the trend of electrical
burns among different demographic and socio professional categories of the population.
According to studies of burning and electrocution risks [9–13], the main causing
factors of accidents are the noncompliance with the correct preventive measures, such
as: regular inspection of equipment, use of personal protective equipment, lack of
necessary competences to handle electric duties, and the non respect of the right
procedures and methods during the course of work. These causing factors can be
generalized to many occupational safety and health aspects in developing countries, for
the work force is generally unskilled or semiskilled, not trained in safe work practices,
poorly paid, temporarily employed, exhibit low production rates, besides, the lack of
management commitment to safety programs and various safety procedures, as has
been pointed out by Koehn et al. [12].
In Algeria, despite the regulations which emphasis the different aspects of risks
prevention, studies of occupational accidents [14–16], show that workers in industrial
environment are exposed to different occupational risks that can be of fatal conse-
quences. Statistics of the Algerian ofﬁcial bodies are alarming too, the National
Institute of Professional Risks Prevention [17], Social Insurances for Salaried Workers
[18]. According to the Algerian renewable energy development center (CDER) [19]
burning and electrocuting accidents due to the misuse of electrical installations caused
225 accidents with 164 deaths in 2009 (no recent ﬁgures are available). But as Allison
Haluik [20], points out: “due to its familiarity and everyday use, people are often
328
B. Mebarki et al.

complacent to electrical hazards and underestimate the risks associated with exposure
to electricity”. This is a fact, either at home or in work situations.
To tackle the problem of occupational hazards from its roots, and to limit its
harmful effects on employees and its negative percussions on production settings and
the environment at large, the “priori evaluation of risks” methods seem appropriate.
This has become a common practice in many industrial settings in the developed
countries. While, in the developing countries the evaluation of occupational risks has
not yet reached the “priori evaluation” stage.
The aim of the present study is to determine the priority of action to undertake in
order to prevent electrocuting and burning risks facing the workers, through a process
of diagnosis, identiﬁcation and analysis, taking as example electrocuting and burning
situations in an Algerian setting “INFRAFER” specialized in the production of railway
concrete sleepers, based in Oran, Algeria.

Method and Procedures
2.1
Sample
The evaluation process of risks in the railway concrete sleepers production shop ﬂoor
was carried out by a sample of three (3) production managers, two (2) safety engineers
and one (1) electrical engineer (n = 6), called experts in this study, their mean expe-
rience in the company was 21.33 (6.25) years.
The evaluation process was carried out on all workers of the shop ﬂoor (n = 38), all
of them males, with a mean age of 34.45 (8.75) years, and a mean experience in the
company of 12.32 (7.55) years. Their distribution among different workstations of the
shop ﬂoor is seen in Table 1.
As shown in Table 1, the shop ﬂoor of railway concrete sleepers production was
divided into four work stations, in which four different tasks were performed by a total
number of thirty eight (38) male workers.
2.2
Tools
In order to evaluate the different aspects of burning and electrocuting risks and to
propose the adequate preventing actions, that are appropriate to the production of
railway concrete sleepers workshop, the following study tools are used:

Ergonomics checkpoints [21]: An ergonomics diagnosis tool elaborated by ILO/IEA in
1996, revised in 2010 was partially used to diagnosis the presence of electrocuting/
burning hazards. Eight (8) checkpoints dealing with electrocuting/burning situations in
the workplace were used in the present study (see Table 2).
A ﬁve steps risks’ priori analysis approach “Methodology of Systems Dysfunction
Analysis” (MADS) developed by a group of searchers [22, 23], was used to assess the
following aspects of electrocuting/electrical burning situations: (1) the occurrence
frequency of risk, (2) the dose of exposition to risk, (3) the exposure level, (4) the level
of severity, (5) level of risk, (6) and to determine the priority of action to undertake, in
order to prevent electrocuting and burning risks facing the workers of work shop ﬂoor.
To collect data on different aspects of the risks under study, the researchers have used
MADS worksheets and observation grid as described in Périlhon [22].
2.3
Procedures
The ﬁeld study was carried out from January 20th to February 21st, 2016, in the work shop
ﬂoor of the railway concrete sleepers production company, in Oran Algeria. The range of
temperature in Oran during February 2016 was 8°–10° (lowest) and 17°–19° (highest).
The rest of physical working conditions inside the workshop were measured by appro-
priate apparatus, their mean values were: Mean noise level: 79.5 db (11.43), mean light

intensity: 473.5 lx. (175.41), mean humidity level: 62.20% (0.89), mean interior air
speed: 2.02 m/s. (0.17).
The study was conducted along two stages, namely: the risk’s diagnostic stage and
the risk’s evaluation stage.
2.3.1
Diagnosis Stage
After an initial walk through the work area, and several sessions of consultation with
managers, safety ofﬁcers and workers, eight (8) checkpoints were selected from the
ILO/IEA 132 checkpoints, for the diagnostic of electrocution and burning risks. The
researchers inspected the indicated checkpoints and the relevant items, reported the
proposed action to undertake and the relevant remarks, exactly as indicted in the
manual of use the ILO tool [21], results of the diagnosis stage are described in Table 2.
2.3.2
Evaluation Stage
The researchers organized a series of meeting with the six members of the evaluation
team (experts), as they are the corner stone in the evaluation process, according to
MADS method strategy. The aims of the meetings were to involve the evaluation team
members in all the steps and procedures of the evaluation process, and to make them
familiar with the present study tools and procedures, as they are going to rate factors,
situations and parameters of electrical risk situations.
In order to analyze, evaluate and determine the priority of action to undertake in
order to prevent electrocuting and burning risks facing the workers of workshop, the
ﬁve steps of MADS method were implemented as follows:
Step 1: Estimation of the frequency of exposure to risk, the level of risk detection
and the level of severity by the evaluation team, on the relevant worksheet.
Step 2: Estimation of the number of workers exposed to electrical risks, their
training level and the risk increasing factors by the evaluation team, on an appro-
priate worksheet.
Step 3: Collect of observations by the researchers on the time of exposure to the risk
spent by the workers, their number and whether they used personal protection
equipments (PPE) or not? The observation process lasted one month, during which
twenty four (24) observations were collected on observation grid designed for the
purpose.

Results
3.1
Diagnosis Stage
The diagnosis results of electrocuting and burning risks in the workshop (Table 2)
conﬁrmed the presence of such hazards. In front of each risk situation, a proposed
action to undertake is described, in order to alienate the hazardous situations as rec-
ommended by ILO/IEA [21].
Burning and Electrocution Risk’s Evaluation and Prevention Procedures
331

3.2
Evaluation Stage
In order to determine the priority of action to undertake to prevent electrocuting and
burning risks facing the workers of the workshop, ﬁve parameters have to be measured,
according to MADS method [22], these were: (1) the frequency of exposure to risks,
(2) the level of severity ‘LS’, (3) the dose of exposure to risks, (4) the level of exposure
to risk ‘LE’, and (5) the level of risk it self. Measurement results of these parameters
are presented along the following pages.
3.2.1
Frequency of Exposure to Risks
Three categories of exposure to risks were sorted out by the evaluation team, namely:
(1) a permanent exposure to risk, when the worker was exposed once a week, (2) a
frequent exposure to risk, when the worker was exposed once a month, and (3) a rare
exposure to risk, when the worker was exposed once a year. Results (Table 3) revealed
that four out of six experts (66.66%) rated the exposure to electrocution and burning
risks in the permanent category, as the workers of the shop ﬂoor were dealing with
electrical hazardous situations at least once a week.
3.2.2
Level of Risk Detection (LR)
Was either at simple level, when the risk can be visually detected, or at complex level,
when the detection of the risk needs depth analysis and necessary equipment to unveil
its source and consequences. Results (Table 3) revealed that four out of six experts
(66.66%) estimated the detection level as a complex operation, because most of the
electrical malfunctions require in-depth analysis and use of appropriate detection
equipment by qualiﬁed personal. While, two experts (33.33%) estimated that the
detection of electrical hazards in the work shop ﬂoor under investigation could be done
visually.
3.2.3
Level of Severity (LS)
This is the level of seriousness of the electrocution/burning risk which was evaluated
on a ﬁve point scale, from a ﬁrst level of severity (LS1) “a slight impact on health” to
the ﬁfth level of severity (LS5) “fatal accident”. When asked to rate the level of
electrocution risks facing the workers of the shop ﬂoor, experts’ estimations were
spread along the rating scale, from “a slight impact on health” to “fatal accident” with a
tendency towards “serious impact” and “fatal accident” (Table 3).

Risk Increasing Factors
These factors where estimated by the experts team on a worksheet, indicating in front
of each factor the answer (yes/no) they think was the correct estimation. Results of
experts are shown in Table 4. In the absence of training records and professional skills
of the workers of the shop ﬂoor, experts of the evaluation team, as they were
acquainted with the personal of the work shop ﬂoor, were addressed to evaluate the
training level of the workers to deal with electrical equipment and electrical tasks,
83.34% of the responders agreed that the workers were not trained enough to perform
the tasks in question. When asked to evaluate the impact of physical working condi-
tions on the workers, nearly all the experts agreed on the negative impact of the
physical work conditions. This results was in agreement with the inadequate values
recorded by researchers during the period of the ﬁeld study. The night work, as a risk
increasing factor was totally absent in the present case study, the work was done during
the day hours.

3.2.5
The Dose of Exposure to Risks (DE)
Was determined from the following six parameters:
• Time of exposure to the risk (short period: less than 50% of working time, long
period: more than 50%),
• Number of workers exposed to risk (small: two workers and less, large: more than
two workers),
• Trained/untrained workforce,
• Protection equipments (used/not used),
• Existence of Increasing factors: physical working conditions/night work,
• Level of risk detection (simple: visual detection/complex: in-depth analysis).
Five parameters of exposure dose out of six, were rated by experts of the evaluation
team in the high zone dose. Although, the exposure to the risk was for short periods
during working hours, all the other factors were in favour of a high dose of exposure, as
the workers were untrained to deal with situations involving electrical duties and
equipment, the personal protecting equipment were not used, the risk detection was a
complex operation that needs appropriate equipment and expertise, beside the presence
of bad physical working conditions as risk’s increasing factors.
3.2.6
Level of Exposure to Risk (LE)
Is the combination of both the frequency and the dose of exposure to risk. The level of
exposure has been divided into three categories: low, moderate and high level, as
shown in Table 7.
As shown in the Table 7, the results of the present study revealed a high level of
exposure to risks. This was a result of the combination of:
1. The frequency of exposure to risks which was a permanent exposure (once a week)
as evaluated by 66.66% of experts of the present study (Table 3) and,
2. The dose of exposure which was a high dose, accumulating ﬁve parameters
(Table 6): (1) all the workers of the shop ﬂoor were exposed, (2) untrained
workforce, (3) personal protective equipment unused and/or do not exist, (4) beside
the presence of risk increasing factors like, bad physical working conditions, (5) the
level of the risk detection was estimated as a complex operation, which needs an
expert’s intervention and an in-depth analysis.

shop ﬂoor (n = 38), as estimated by the experts (n = 6).

3.2.7
Level of Risk (LR)
Is the ﬁfth and last parameter of the evaluation process of the MADS method.
According to the value of this parameter, the appropriate action will be taken. the level
of risk was calculated from two parameters: (i) level of exposure (LE) and (ii) level of
severity (LS), as shown Table 8.
The results presented in matrix Table 8, revealed that the level of electrocution risk
was estimated as urgent, requiring a third priority of action (P3), corresponding to a
collective protection strategy, according to MADS methodology.

which were used, in order to detect the presence/absence of electrocution/burns in the
work place. All ingredients of electrocution, burning and ﬁre catching were present in
the work shop ﬂoor of the present study, like the use of unsafe power tools with no
proper insulation, unsafe wiring connections for equipment and lights, with no easy
access to ﬁrst-aid equipment and primary health-care facilities, etc.
These are common practices in many industrially developing countries, as has been
pointed out in different studies, and among many occupational groups [12, 13],
Attempts to explain such phenomenon are multiples, some of them refer to cultural
explanations, like the naivety in dealing with hazards [24], or perceptions of experience
with risks [25], others refer to the lack of the necessary training in dealing with
electrical equipment, lack of safety culture and non-compliance with occupational
safety and Health regulations [26].
Although the phenomenon of carelessness and acceptability or tolerability of a risk
in dealing with hazardous situation is still enigmatic [26], the results of the present
study cannot go beyond the evaluation and assessment of electrocuting and burning
hazards, as the explanation of the situation needs in depth studies.
The frequency of exposure to risks (FE) was estimated by 66.6% of experts
(Table 3) of this study as a permanent risk (once a week). The dose of exposure to
risks, as a further step in our analysis can bring more light on the situation. Although,
the workers of the present study dealt with hazardous situations for short periods of
time (Table 6), the large number of untrained workers exposed to such a risk, and the
non use of personal protective equipment, made the dose of exposure bigger than
expected from the frequency of exposure rating, particularly in the presence of risk
increasing factors, like: bad physical working conditions. All these factors, beside the
complexity of risk detection, as it needs in depth analysis and experts’ intervention,
gave us a high dose of exposure to electrocution and burning hazards (Table 6). These
results pinpoint the high level of exposure (Table 7). When experts were asked to rate
the present level of severity on a ﬁve points scale from: “a slight impact on health” to
“fatal accident”, the evaluation results spread along the ﬁve points of the scale, with a
tendency towards “serious impact” and “fatal accident” (Table 3). This tendency is the
result of a number of factors like:
1. The design of the workshop itself, which does not respond to the standards of
occupational safety, making workers close to the electrical connections, and thus
become more susceptible to electrocution hazards.
2. The lack of awareness among workers and managers, alike, of the dangers caused
by the non-respect of the safety standards of equipment and facilities, and their
regular maintenance.
3. Health and safety programs are especially weak or totally absent, for aspects dealing
with electrical hazards, as their detection needs in depth analysis and experts’
intervention.
By identifying the priority level, the present study recommended that “a collective
protection strategy” is the appropriate action to take, in order to prevent this category of
risks. The collective protection strategy should be implemented, through an effective
electrical safety program, which “embraces multiple strategies that seem to have the
best chance to eliminate injury” [27]. Safety program is a collective action, is based on
336
B. Mebarki et al.

collaborative ergonomics solutions which as has been advocated by many ergonomists
as “participatory ergonomics program” [28–31].
The study revealed the following results: (1) a constant frequency of electrocuting
and burning risk facing the workers of workshop; (2) a strong dose of exposure to risks
(3) a high level of exposure to risks (4) the risk of electrifying and burning has a serious
impact, but without complications; (5) the level of seriousness calls for rapid
intervention.
5
Conclusion
Despite the many regulations and laws concerning the different risks at the work place
in general, and electrocution, burning and ﬁre catching in particular, the situation of
safety is still alarming in the Algerian industrial sector.
It is essential to ﬁnd the right combination of rules, believes, attitudes, and good
practices, which will create a positive safety culture at workplace in the Algerian
industrial sector. Such a combination seems to be a very challenging exercise to policy
makers, government departments, managers, trade unions and workers at the shop ﬂoor
level.
By identifying the priority action to prevent electrocution and burning risks, the
present study is clearly advocating for a participatory ergonomics approach, as it
concerns all the stakeholders of the work place.

Introduction
Climbing is an important fundamental skill that children acquire in early childhood.
Children love to climb everything, including consumer products, such as furniture, that
are not designed to be climbed on. This puts children at risk of severe injuries. According
to a report from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), on average,
every 30 min tipped furniture or a falling TV sends an injured child to the emergency
room in the United States [1], one and two-year-olds account for most of furniture-
related injuries, 2,000 and 1,700 injuries annually based on CPSC estimation, respec‐
tively [2]. Adult supervision as a major contributor of child injury prevention is contro‐
versial [3], but injuries can occur even with adult supervision. It is crucial to create safe
environment which allows children to take risks and challenge their potentials.
Recently, research on injury prevention using advanced technologies has started.
Kakara et al. developed the child behavior measuring system using 12 video cameras and
the bluetooth-compatible acceleration-gyro sensor attached to a child and analyzed injury
risk due to falls [4]. They used the body trunk’s motion data to conduct a realistic biome‐
chanical simulation and to assess injury risks. In the field of elderly care, Robinovich
et al. installed cameras in long-term care facilities and collected 227 fall data from 130
people over nearly three years. By analyzing fall video data, they revealed that the most
common cause of falls was incorrect weight shifting, followed by a trip or stumble, hit or
bump, loss of support, and collapse [5].
Winston, Puzino, and Romer, the world’s leading researchers in the ﬁeld of injury
prevention, called for a shift from “one-size-ﬁts-all” or universal strategies to “tiered
risk strategies” to achieve precision prevention [6]. Utilizing advanced technologies and

understanding people’s behaviors are a promising approach to precision prevention. The
research utilizing these technologies will surely advance the injury prevention research
ﬁeld forward.
The purpose of this study is to collect children’s climbing behavioral data to clarify
the relationship between climbing behavior and object features. Although anchoring
furniture is a recommended action that parents and caregivers should take to protect
children from serious injuries and deaths, designing safer and more stable furniture is
necessary because it would not require one’s preventive action. Also, collecting child‐
ren’s climbing behavioral data and understanding how children climb on objects makes
it possible to conduct precision prevention for furniture tip-over injuries.

Methods
We did an observational study between February 6, 2017, and February 19, 2017 in
Tokyo, Japan. A climbing apparatus measuring 158 cm W × 112 cm D × 97 cm H was
constructed from a common Japanese children’s product which consists of ø3 cm
smooth, rigid, cardboard tubing and plastic connectors. Figure 1 shows a picture of the
area where our study was conducted and the climbing apparatus. The apparatus includes
7 diﬀerent climbing features (Fig. 2).

On the day of the experiment, we asked a parent their child’s age and height, then
measured the child’s weight with a weighing scale. Children were asked to play with
the apparatus as long as they wanted. Most children repeated cycles of playing with the
apparatus and taking a break. Two RGB-D cameras (Microsoft’s Kinect) were used to
record the children’s interactions with the various climbing features. Snapshots of the
experiments in progress are shown in Fig. 3.
After we conducted all the experiments, we analyzed the video for climbing patterns
and developed a database consisting of age, climbing patterns, object features and
videos.

Results
Fourteen children ages 12 to 58 months participated in this study. We recorded data for
249 observations of climbing behavior. We observed 8 climbing behavior patterns; how
children use their appendages to interact with various climbing features to support their
weight (Fig. 4). Based on our analysis, older children use strategies that involve less
body contact with the climbing apparatus. We developed a climbing strategy map to
show the relationship between age and climbing strategies used. An example of the
climbing strategy map is shown in Fig. 5. Then, we linked it to a video library. When
you click each icon on the map, you will obtain a video which shows a child using a
particular climbing behavior on a speciﬁc climbing feature (Fig. 6).

Discussion
Our results show the relationship between age and climbing strategies used. We also
observed 8 diﬀerent climbing strategy patterns in this study. By analyzing climbing
behavior data, we see how children use their body parts to interact with the climbing
apparatus based on their age. As we mentioned previously, one and two-year-olds
account for most of furniture-related injuries. Understanding climbing behaviors based
344
M. Oono et al.

on age and actual climbing footage will help manufacturers improve the safety of their
consumer products. Our results also suggest that we can scientiﬁcally analyze children’s
climbing behavior and that being able to determine its patterns will lead to developing
more powerful prevention approaches.
The study faced some important limitations that should be noted. First, we believe
that children’s climbing patterns will vary and the number of the patterns will increase
as conditions of the apparatus change. For instance, the apparatus used in this study was
made of smooth, rigid, cardboard tubing, which children can comfortably touch with
their hands and feet. When children try to climb objects which have a rough surface or
an edge similar to that of a dresser drawer, their climbing patterns will change. Also,
the shape of a climbing object will signiﬁcantly aﬀect how children interact with the
object. If a climbing object consists of cuboid, children cannot climb the same as a jungle
gym. We hope to investigate what environmental factors inﬂuences children’s climbing
behaviors in the future.
We consider our results as a fundamental component for precision prevention for
furniture tip-over injuries. In this paper, we discussed the relationship between objective
features and climbing patterns based on age. Since we used Kinect sensors, climbing
posture data were also recorded. We can use these data to determine the center of gravity,
and calculate the amount of force applied to a target object. Then, we can conduct a
simulation to assess the injury risk of furniture tip-over. Further research is needed to
apply children’s climbing behavior data to designing tip resistant furniture.

Conclusion
We observed 14 children’s climbing behaviors using 2 RGB-D sensors and recorded
the children’s interactions with various climbing features. In addition, we developed the
climbing strategy map linked to a video library. We understand the relationship between
climbing behavior and object features within an age group. In future study, we will
continue to gather climbing behavioral data, reﬁne the map and hope to locate the child’s
center of gravity while climbing. Moreover, we hope to develop a simulation system to
show the impact on an object and to apply the research results to new safety standards.

and is involved in system redesigns that, had they been implemented, could have
precluded those accidents. Through the lens of STPA, we aim to pinpoint the
overarching causes of problems in the South Korean disclosure system and ﬁnd
more effective remedies. Having suspected Hanmi Pharmaceutical of being part
of an insider trading scandal, South Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service
investigated that company. By applying the STAMP model, we derive more
insightful recommendations regarding the timely disclosure of company infor-
mation, and thus the prevention of suspicious (and possibly illegal) short selling
in the stock market.

Introduction
The ﬁnancial market has been evolving as an increasingly complex sociotechnical
system. Financial systems beneﬁt from interacting extensively with various disciplines,
including not only social but also scientiﬁc ﬁelds [1]. The extent of such beneﬁts is
contingent upon having a good understanding of many recurring failures in ﬁnancial
markets. Financial crises have been witnessed in many economies for quite some time.
Previous studies on ﬁnancial crises mostly performed data analysis by using traditional
economic models or variants thereof; typically, in such studies, a speciﬁc economic
model is built as a set of equations, and quite frequently is rendered insolvable through
the use of further equations. Practically, problems in the ﬁnancial market tend to
involve various components and thus are not easily explained only by mathematical

modelling. Recently, a considerable body of engineering literature has suggested the
use of systems-theoretic accident models and processes (STAMP) as a methodology
that leverages systemic interaction among individual components.
This study applies the STAMP approach to a recent occurrence of turbulence in the
South Korean ﬁnancial sector—namely, the aftermath of massive short selling. On
September 30, 2016, the South Korean stock market witnessed the massive short
selling of Hanmi Pharmaceutical stock [11]. The Financial Services Commission
(FSC), South Korea’s ﬁnancial regulator, investigated whether institutional investors
were aware of the termination of an anticancer drug license between Boehringer
Ingelheim and Hanmi before the information was disclosed to the market. On the other
hand, prosecutors failed to prove the culpability of Hanmi’s corporate disclosure team,
but did indict four individuals of the illegal use of information that had not been
ofﬁcially disclosed in the online disclosure system. In that sense, massive short selling
is likely to be considered a case of misconduct involving individual investors, rather
than a systemic problem on the part of the company.
Using the STAMP framework, this study aims to determine the possible causes of
problematic short sales, and it suggests how to preclude similar problems [2, 7, 21].
Section 2 provides background information on the STAMP approach, and Sect. 3
analyzes the Hanmi short selling accident, by using the STAMP/systems-theoretic
process analysis (STPA) method. Section 4 concludes.

Background Information and Literature Review
2.1
Proximate Events
In July 2015, Hanmi Pharmaceutical made a license-out contract with Boehringer
Ingelheim; that contract enabled the export of technology used to develop lung cancer
medicine. Immediately after disclosure of the news, Hanmi’s stock price almost dou-
bled, and remained above USD 600. However, that contract—valued at USD 7.7
billion—was terminated as of September 30, 2016, and news of that cancellation was
released to the stock market at 09:28 on September 30. Curiously, short sales of 50,471
Hanmi shares occurred in the 28 min between when the market opened (at 09:00) and
the time of Hanmi’s posting on the Data Analysis, Retrieval and Transfer System
(DART) system. The amount of short sales occurring immediately before the disclosure
constituted almost one-half of all short sales made that day; additionally, the entire
volume of short selling made that day was almost 20 times the average volume seen by
Hanmi.
Figures 1 and 2 provide some information regarding trends in the trade of Hanmi
Pharmaceutical stock.
Such an unusually large amount of short selling was suspected of being indicative
of insider information trading, and thus came under investigation by the FSC and
prosecutors. The relevant studies include [2–4, 6, 10].
Our approach is rooted in engineering-based accident analysis, or so-called
STAMP; it includes mechanical or human elements that span all the contextual and
organizational components of complicated sociotechnical systems. [13].
348
Y.W. Lee et al.

The STAMP model views accidents as an outcome of inappropriate interactions
among system components, rather than as problems that stem from individual com-
ponents. As Leveson points out, major accidents usually derive from unsafe behavior
and interaction involving various components in the control structure [15] (Reliability
Engineering and System Safety 136, 2015, 17–34).
The need in South Korea for a uniﬁed ﬁnancial supervisory body arose from the
Asian ﬁnancial crisis. The FSC was launched in 2008, when the Financial Supervisory
Commission merged with the Financial Policy Bureau of the Ministry of Finance and
Economy. Using statutory mandates to draft and amend ﬁnancial laws and regulations,
the FSC supervises ﬁnancial institutions, issues regulatory licenses, and monitors
foreign currency markets. The FSC integrates the ﬁnancial supervisory functions of the
Ministry of Finance and Economy (currently the Ministry of Strategy and Finance) and

the Bank of Korea. Additionally, it provides direction and guidance for the Financial
Supervisory Service (FSS), which examines and investigates ﬁnancial institutions [9].
The FSS was launched by virtue of the Act on the Establishment of Financial
Supervisory Organizations, in 1997; it was given the authority to supervise, in an
integrated manner, the four ﬁnancial sectors (i.e., banking, securities, insurance, and
credit management funds) that were once under the auspices of the Finance Ministry.
The FSC and FSS conform to the two-tier supervisory system for ﬁnancial insti-
tutions in Korea. Principally, the FSS is in charge of capital market supervision,
ﬁnancial consumer protection, and other oversight and enforcement activities, under
the guidance of the FSC. On the other hand, the FSC is responsible for amending rules
and approving licenses that relate to establishing ﬁnancial institutions. As a government
regulator, the FSC is staffed by civil servants, while the FSS—as a specially legislated
supervisory authority—is staffed by private sector employees.

Analysis of the Hanmi Short Selling Episode
The use of systems-theoretic tools can be enormously beneﬁcial to considering any sort
of organizational question, whether in reference to physical or intangible factors.
However, most use of STAMP approach has been made to accidents involving physical
components [15, 16, 19].
Traditional perspectives—such as chain of events—tend to misunderstand the
relationship between safety and reliability [13, 15] states that safety is an emergent
property of the system; however, reliability is a characteristic of individual compo-
nents. The systems-theoretic view of safety conceptualizes system safety as a control
problem. Many discussions with respect to modern accidents touch upon issues with
component interaction in sociotechnical systems. [5, 8].
STAMP is a model used to analyze the causal relationships among the elements
involved in an accident. STAMP analyzes individuals not considered by the techniques
inherent in models that are based on chain of events and various sociotechnical ele-
ments [13].
STAMP consists of three basic concepts—namely, safety constraints, the hierar-
chical safety control structure, and the process model [13–15]. Safety constraints
constitute a basic STAMP concept. Accidents occur wherever there is insufﬁcient
control of system operations. System safety is obtained by securing appropriate con-
trols at each level seen in Fig. 3. Hierarchical structures, meanwhile, determine controls
and procedures: higher levels determine controls, procedures, policies, and the like,
while lower levels actually derive from those controls, procedures, and policies. The
third concept, the process model, includes the controller and the controlled process
used to represent hierarchical control structures for systems and accidents. The con-
troller sends a control action and feedback to the controller, through the controlled
process.
STPA is a new safety analysis technique that analyzes the STAMP accident model
[17, 18, 20]. Even where there is no error in the system or in the system elements
themselves, risk factors that stem from interactions among elements can be removed.
Especially in terms of analyzing risk factors, STPA has features that differ from those
350
Y.W. Lee et al.

in the traditional methods; these include hardware, software, people, and organization.
After analyzing systems by using the STAMP model, STPA can be used to pinpoint
unsafe control actions that could lead to accidents, and it analyzes their causes [15].
STPA performs safety analysis in four steps, as follows [15].
Phase 1. Set the risk and safety constraints of the system
Phase 2. Derive the control structure of the system (construction)
Phase 3. STPA step 1: Identify unsafe control actions that may be system risk factors

To perform STPA, the risk and safety constraints of the system are deﬁned as per
the procedures ordered above, and the control structure is identiﬁed. When one’s
understanding of the control structure is complete, the ﬁrst step in the STPA is to
determine the inappropriate controls that create risk; these inappropriate controls are
classiﬁed as per the typology depicted in Fig. 3.
In collaboration with the FSC, the FSS supervises South Korea’s corporate dis-
closure system. As shown in Fig. 4, the FSS is South Korea’s integrated ﬁnancial
regulator, and it examines and supervises ﬁnancial institutions under the broad oversight
of the FSC, the government regulatory authority. The FSS is responsible for listed
companies with regards to their disclosure of corporate information on operational and
ﬁnancial activities. To facilitate a more timely disclosure process, the FSS’s automated
and online disclosure system (i.e., DART) needs to be systematically redesigned.
Fig. 5 shows that many countries control their short selling by means of ﬁnancial
regulations. Once we have identiﬁed these four key controls, we look for the possible
sources of those controls. After analyzing the causes and identifying possible scenarios
in Table 1, they are removed.
Phase 3. STPA step 1: Identify unsafe control action that may be system risk factors
Having suspected that Hanmi Pharmaceutical was part of an insider trading scandal,
the FSS focused its investigation on the company. The FSC investigated whether
institutional investors were aware of the termination of the anticancer drug license
between Boehringer Ingelheim and Hanmi before the news was disclosed. The South
Korean ﬁnancial regulator also unveiled a set of tougher measures with regards to short

prevent market volatility and enhance monitoring on possibly illegal transactions.

Conclusion
By applying the STAMP model, we can derive some meaningful recommendations
regarding the timely disclosure of company information, and thus possibly prevent
suspicious and/or illegal short selling on the stock market. Financial market partici-
pants, practitioners, and policy-makers have too much conﬁdence in the DART system.
The FSS, as a private sector employee, should be a sophisticated supervisory system;
however, the system’s weak points were revealed upon making investigations into the
short selling of Hanmi Pharmaceutical.
A possible lesson from this case of massive short selling is that such a problem is
not a consequence of failure among particular components, but rather involves the
complex interactions among system components. Therefore, detecting a speciﬁc
component failure may not contribute meaningfully to accident analysis. A systemic
approach to such analysis allows for more fundamental remedies to ﬁnancial market
problems.
The main problem with short selling is overconﬁdence. The role of short selling in
the market is nothing wicked—on the contrary, it is a highly efﬁcient form of economic
and social organization—but it is vulnerable to panic. The results of STPA suggest that
the disclosure system should be redesigned to prevent information leakage.

Abstract. Several distinct but intrinsically related sections are discussed from
an epidemiological standpoint including the epidemiology of risks, individual
versus population risks, intervention and prevention. A number of speciﬁc risk
factors identiﬁed in published research are considered and categorized for either
individual or population-level eﬀect. Risk factor assessment, with an emphasis
on the concept of risk level among individuals through their life span is speciﬁed,
with a focus on consumption patterns. The eﬃcacy of prevention is evaluated
among intervention approaches, with case studies provided for context.

Introduction
The terms ‘individual level’ and ‘population level’ are used to distinguish between two
fundamentally diﬀerent concepts: individual level refers to considerations which can be
applied to a single individual, whereas population level refers to the aggregate data
developed from the study of multiple individuals sharing some elemental similarity by
which the population is identiﬁed.
1.1
Risk Factors and Causality
Due to the low overall percent of a given population, which will display abnormally
high risk factors, there is low eﬃcacy for reducing the overall occurrence of an aﬄiction
resulting from individual interventions based on developed risk proﬁles. This is because
a majority of the population which develops a condition will not necessarily display a
high level of the known risk factors to be related to the aﬄiction.

While most risk factors – including gender, disability, education, and primary language
ﬂuency – can be evaluated as distinct among individuals of a population, some factors
are better suited for investigation solely on the level of the population they aﬀect. These
factors are associated with increased risk levels across an aﬀected population, including
socioeconomic status and geographical location. Age, can be placed in both categories,
and will be discussed twice in this section.
2.1
Risk Factors of Individuals
Risk factors on an individual level can be deﬁned as behaviors or inherent characteristics
distinct among members of a population but commonly associated with their status of
risk. These factors may be evaluated as aggregate data, but their impact will be measured
as a percentage of individuals that are aﬀected by a given risk. In contrast to population
risk, individual risk level is determined by the sum total of an individual’s risk factors,
elements that don’t impact wide swaths of the population at a time: age, gender, disa‐
bility, education and language ﬂuency.
Age. Age is the single factor guaranteed to change throughout the lifespan, altering the
risk proﬁle dramatically as individual’s progress through established categories. An
infant will have diﬀerent risks than a child, an adolescent, an adult, and a senior [1].
Infants experience perhaps the greatest amount of passive risk. They are exposed to risk
factors that they are unable to either encounter or avoid on their own. They are especially
sensitive to environmental risks such as second-hand smoke or strangulation by
normally benign household objects, which they are unable to avoid independently.
Although their overall health has not yet had time to deteriorate, infants are also uniquely
at risk for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and various risks associated with
premature birth.
As they mature, children develop more self-suﬃciency. During childhood, more risk
factors impact them due to their uninformed choices regarding risk. This requires inves‐
tigation into the diﬀerences of risk perception by age group. Adolescents in particular
are described as experiencing increased risk associated with social factors [2] which
may be related to their continuing social development or desire to feel socially accepted.
A challenge in the study of risk perception using a psychometric scale is that it is diﬃcult
to gather objective data. A 1995 study of the diﬀerences in risk-perception between
adolescents and adults found teenagers to be less optimistic of avoiding injury than their
parents, with their level of optimism decreasing proportionally to their increasing risk
of injury [3].
Seniors may be evaluated as a distinct group. Compared to other age groups, they
display increased health risks from traumatic injuries and illnesses. However, they also
show a greater suspicion of novel health treatments and associated greater resistance to
trying such measures [4], as well as an inaccurate perception of their own risk [5].
Adults that are not yet seniors are considered only briefly in this section, as they are the
general population by which a baseline standard of risk is established for most consumer
358
M.L. Bench et al.

products. This can be evaluated in relation to adults as a ‘target audience’ of sorts, in which
the population receiving information – be it advertisements or warnings – is a member of
this age group and most likely to comply with warnings. While an adolescent may ignore
a warning, a child will likely not have the means to purchase a potentially dangerous
product and is assumed to be protected from avoidable risks by adults. The senior popu‐
lation is also affected by this phenomenon; a senior at high risk is expected to have a
caretaker who can assist in the avoidance of risks.
Gender. From a behavioral standpoint, females have been shown to be more risk averse
than males; when presented with decisions involving risk for a potential future gain,
females have been shown to both overestimate the probability of a negative outcome
and underestimate the potential long term beneﬁts of taking such a risk. Males,
conversely, appear inclined to overestimate the probability of positive outcomes as well
as the potential beneﬁts they may see. Some health risks are proving to be more behav‐
iorally-related than intrinsically linked to gender [6]. The incidence of cardiovascular
disease has traditionally been higher in men; however in recent years this gender gap is
closing, in part due to women joining the workforce in higher numbers and progressing
into higher stress positions. Other more acute health risks of injury and death, especially
work-related, have traditionally been weighted towards the male population due to their
disproportionately high representation in professions with an increased incidence of
physical trauma, such as construction.
Disability. Individuals with disabilities may experience overall elevated levels of risk
throughout their lives for a variety of reasons, many due to the characteristics of their
disability. The most commonly cited deﬁnition of disability within the international
community was developed by the World Health Organization in 1976, “a disability is
any restriction or lack (resulting from an impairment) of ability to perform an activity
in the manner or within the range considered normal for a human being” [7]. The updated
Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0) released in 2010 includes physical,
mental and substance-use disorders [8]. Cognitive disabilities, while also present across
a wide spectrum of severity, are considered separately from physical disabilities for a
number of reasons. Cognitive impairment is more likely to have been present from birth,
though some conditions are more associated with aging while others may develop in
response to life events, and are more diﬃcult to diagnose [9, 10]. Both categories of
disability, however, show an increased prevalence in the senior population, developing
as they age.
Education. Education can be considered inﬂuential in determining an individual’s
level of risk. While the primary eﬀect of education is easy to observe – persons who are
precognizant of a given risk will be better equipped to make decisions regarding their
exposure to that risk – secondary eﬀects are often overlooked. The direct eﬀect of lower
education is a lower baseline of knowledge of the information that is communicated in
an academic environment. This aﬀects individual health when such knowledge becomes
related to consumer risk factors such as dangerous chemicals and equipment (see Fig. 1),
and common activities associated with lowering risks such as reading labels or instruc‐
tions to avoid product hazards or misuse. For example, a study of antimicrobial
Perspective of Individual and Population Health Risk Prevention
359

prescriptions found that 33% of physicians yielded to patient requests for antibiotics,
while only 4.3% of specialists did so [11].
Fig. 1. Some warning labels may be diﬃcult for users to comprehend and comply with.
Higher educated individuals have greater health literacy and are more likely to
comprehend the context and meaning of standard risk communications, increasing their
chances of understanding new encounters with risk information. Education may also be
considered a type of language ﬂuency, in which higher-educated people have the knowl‐
edge and means to understand the esoteric language used commonly in risk communi‐
cations [12]. Limited health literacy impacts comprehension of patient safety informa‐
tion that accompanies pharmaceuticals (see Fig. 2), which can lead to failure to adhere
to critical prescribing information, as well as understanding the risks [13].
Fig. 2. Patient safety information may be diﬃcult for some individuals to comprehend, or read
due to the small font (7-point on this label).
Language Fluency. Language ﬂuency – as determined by the level of language an
individual speaks in relation to the dominant language of the surrounding population –
can impact risk factors and comprehension of risk communication. An example of this
concept is the Hispanic population of the United States; there is an increase of over 10%
in awareness of cigarette warning labels shown with high acculturation, including the
adoption of the English language, in this population subset [14].
360
M.L. Bench et al.

Manufacturers of consumer products may be compelled to address language ﬂuency
both due to an awareness of risk through consumer incidents and near-miss events.
Failure-to-warn cases have succeeded by establishing company awareness of foreign
language users of their product without placement of additional warnings written “in a
way that communicates clearly and eﬀectively with all of the relevant populations at
risk,” a consideration that is inclusive of both the adequacy of translation and commu‐
nication to illiterate users when necessary [15]. Internationally, there is no standard for
the adequacy of translations. An appendix of the ANSI-Z535 standard provides trans‐
lations of signal words [16].
2.2
Risk Variation Among Populations
In contrast to individual risk, population risk impacts members of a given population
where and how it lives.
Socioeconomic Status. Socioeconomic Status (SES) impacts risk variation in a number
of ways. Not only does SES directly affect the risks an individual is exposed to – as indi‐
viduals of higher SES are exposed to different risks than those of lower SES – SES is often
correlated with other population-level risk factors. Rural geographic areas are more
commonly associated with low SES inhabitants, as are neighborhoods in large urban
centers [17]. Low SES is associated with a myriad of problems which can increase the
overall risk level, as well as several specific risk factors. Nutritional deficits are more
common to people with low SES due to their inability to secure healthy food. Many
crimes also are increased in low SES communities, perhaps even underestimated due to
reluctance of many low SES populations to consult legal authorities, even when they may
require protection [18]. High SES is also associated with risks, albeit of a different kind
than those common to low SES. High SES populations are more likely to be exposed to
foreign pathogens, as they travel more. There are also certain ‘luxury risks’ which are
more common to high SES brackets – certain prohibited drugs are more commonly abused
by wealthier individuals [19], and high SES is associated with the availability of certain
high risk entertainment activities which are not available to less affluent individuals, such
as sky diving, scuba diving and skiing.
Geographic Location. The geographic location of a population impacts the risk factors
to which it is exposed by much the same function that socioeconomic status does: certain
risk factors will be increased, reduced, or not be present in all populations because they
are not unilaterally available across sectors. A comparison of urban and rural environ‐
ments is used to illustrate this concept. It is important to note the diﬀerentiation of risk
factors among geographical areas of countries and continents. For example, in a Moscow
winter, warm clothing for cold weather is obligatory but optional in Central America.
There is a tangible eﬀect of overarching legislative themes on risk factors – the strict
regulation of illicit drugs, for example, has a somewhat ironic correlation to the proba‐
bility of death from those drugs which are banned [20–22]. From this data, it can be
concluded that overall risk of drug overdose, whether from habitual abuse with a lack
of legal options for support or one time exuberance and fear of repercussions if medical
Perspective of Individual and Population Health Risk Prevention
361

help is sought, increases in certain geographic locations where there may be legal
consequences.
Rural geographic areas are associated with diﬀerent risk factors than urban areas.
While some highly urbanized, most likely low SES areas are associated with increased
mortality and crime rates, they are reliably well maintained from a standpoint of modern
convenience. Isolated rural areas, however, suﬀer from a lack of common modern
conveniences such as reliable mobile phone coverage and internet connection. The travel
time between rural areas and hospital-quality medical assistance, especially for condi‐
tions requiring a medical specialist, is a key factor. Rural areas are also associated with
a separate set of risk factors – such as injury while using farm equipment not present in
urban communities or hunting accidents. Rural areas may also lack water quality stand‐
ards and have a higher incidence of illnesses from tap water, such as the isolated First
Nation reserves in Canada [23].
Age. Age, previously discussed on an individual level, can also be addressed at the
population level. While consideration of risk levels can be applied universally, certain
populations are evaluated as a conglomerate rather than by diﬀerentiating among indi‐
viduals. As a majority of citizens in high income countries are between the ages of 15
and 64, populations outside this range are most likely to be identiﬁed for special eval‐
uation: children and seniors are of special note here [24]. Children are commonly subject
to age-level restrictions in activities and product use. It is common to see labels indi‐
cating that products are not for use by children under a certain age and games that are
designed for a minimum age. Products may also be subject to age-related precautions,
such as legislation specifying that safety seats must be used for all car passengers below
a given age or weight. On the other end of the age scale, seniors may have unique risk
concerns. These are commonly health-related, such as guidelines established in the
United States by the American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of
Cardiology (ACC) recommending that adults over 75 take a moderate-intensity statin
for primary prevention, even if they have no known cholesterol-related concerns [25].
They are also the target of a number of products and services designed around risk
prevention and reduction, from walkers and canes for ambulation to medical alert
devices and even home assistance for daily activities.
Culture. Culture may also impact risk in ways that are both expected and unforeseen.
Cultures which place a greater emphasis on hygiene, for instance, will show lower
microbial-related disease rates than those that focus on other issues. Minority cultures
in a region are more likely to hold legislative authority in high suspicion, and will there‐
fore show greater resistance to risk-lowering governmental action [14]. A family from
a culture which traditionally values multigenerational households is less likely to respect
regulations limiting the number of residents in small housing units. One instance of such
unforeseen impact is described by the Dunning-Kruger eﬀect [26], that people tend to
incorrectly estimate their levels of competence towards a standard; higher performers
on a variety of tasks tend to underestimate the results they will get, while low performers
predict proportionally higher results for themselves. East Asian cultures, however, show
an overall tendency to underestimate their performance, believing that poor results allow
362
M.L. Bench et al.

them greater opportunities for learning and improvement whereas Western subjects
perceived these results as personal failings. From this study, it can be inferred that
people’s reaction to and perception of risk exposure will be, at least in part, deﬁned by
the culture in which they were predominantly raised.
3
How Risk Factors Change Over an Individual’s Lifespan
It is important to note the dearth of characteristics which remain fully static throughout
a lifespan. While some may be described as such – for a majority of individuals, gender
and culture fall into this category – many more factors, both on individual and population
levels change frequently as a people age. Even characteristics one would not expect to
change progressively through our lifespan are less determined than expected. Language
ﬂuency is a prime example of such: all individuals are born without language ﬂuency,
and gain primary ﬂuency through their guardians. The initial level of primary ﬂuency
may be increased or altered through schooling, social associations, or personal eﬀorts.
Similarly, secondary ﬂuency is normally achieved by either personal or social pressures,
as individuals expand their language base through academic or professional obligations,
to fulﬁll a personal or familial goal for themselves, or to strengthen friendships across
linguistic barriers. This presents diﬃculties in epidemiological study, as individuals’
self-evaluation of their own ﬂuency may not fulﬁll the criterion required for appropriate
translation and interpretation of risk communications in their secondary language.
Conversational ﬂuency is not generally consistent with the level of comprehension
required to interpret or communicate the technical jargon endemic to risk communica‐
tions found on product labels [27].
4
Consumption Patterns: Discrepancies Among Populations
Consumption patterns are highly diﬀerentiated among diﬀerent populations. Research
observing the Finnish population indicates that some of the most inﬂuential factors
determining consumption patterns are economic restraints, social regulation, conven‐
tions, routines, and socialization in peer groups. This is especially important when
determining the discrepancies among easily diﬀerentiable populations, such as those
divided by socio-economic and demographic factors, particularly gender, age, and
income [28].
Products are generally marketed towards a target population to create positive feel‐
ings. This has been investigated thoroughly in recent years in the context of organic
foods. For instance, when the developing market for organic foods was investigated in
Croatia, it was determined that consumers overall, considered produce to be healthy and
of high quality, and were more inclined to overlook detractors such as increased price
[29]. However, the target market is not always determined by perceptions of quality or
economy, as found in a study of energy drink consumption, marketed to young adults
and college students of the mid-Atlantic United States. Results indicated that 51% of
participants consumed energy drinks in relation to product function, citing reasons such
as insuﬃcient sleep (67%), to increase energy (65%), and to drink with alcohol (54%).

363

No signiﬁcant reduction of use was associated with negative side-eﬀects such as head‐
aches or heart palpitations [30].
Consumption pattern diﬀerences are not limited to tangible goods. Insurance poli‐
cies, intangible but undeniably a consumer product, can be used to exemplify both the
discrepancies between population consumption patterns, and the way these diﬀerentials
aﬀect risk factors. Studies conducted in developing countries show limited insurance
markets are stunted by moral hazard: a situation where there is an asymmetry in available
information, a deﬁciency in the ability to enforce contracts, and an awareness that one
party is protected against risk while the other incurs the costs should something go
wrong. Populations without access to formal insurance, due to either geographic location
or economic restraint, develop diﬀerent behavioral patterns to mitigate the risk. For
example, populations without access to insurance are more likely to choose occupations
with a steady income, even if this income is lower than what they could earn through
other less-secure jobs [31].
Risk factors associated with speciﬁc consumption patterns are not necessarily asso‐
ciated with a negative impact on overall consumption. Overt risks are exempliﬁed by
high-risk leisure sports, including skydiving, hang-gliding, climbing or BASE jumping.
Participation in any of these activities increases individual risk for various severe phys‐
ical injuries or death; however, few to none of the products marketed in association with
these activities obscure or minimize apparent risks. These products advertise themselves
as high risk, appealing to individuals’ sense of excitement, adventure, and adrenaline to
actively promote risk associated with consumption as a marketing device [32].
On the opposite end of the perceived risk spectrum is the risk of consuming some
tap water. For example, in Canada, although 25% of individuals in a cross-Canadian
study reported health concerns about tap water, less than 6% of households spent more
than $50 annually on water sanitation, and 25% of households consume exclusively tap
water. Research reports that consumers replace tap water due to ﬂavor or odor while
health concerns were considered only a minor issue, indicating a low awareness of health
concerns; this eﬀect holds even when considered in conjunction with the boiled water
alerts issued in 2012 and 2013 which aﬀected 40,000 and 1.3 million citizens, respec‐
tively [23, 33–36]. Tap water is a product that is consumed regularly and supplied
without advertisement; thus consumers rarely consider the potential of associated risk
factors.

Evaluation of Individual and Population Prevention Approaches
Although prevention of speciﬁc risks at the individual level would appear to be the
optimal method to prevent developing an aﬄiction, such methods have in fact proven
extremely diﬃcult to eﬀectively implement. Confounding factors of individual preven‐
tion include diﬃculty reliably identifying relevant individuals and risk factors, indi‐
vidual resistance to the high-risk label, and general noncompliance of individuals with
specialized risk-reducing regimens. Population-level prevention strategies circumnav‐
igate many of these issues, providing greater eﬃciency in prevention by applying general
364
M.L. Bench et al.

measures to lower the overall risk of an aﬄiction to an entire population, undiﬀerentiated
by its previously-established risk status [37].
5.1
Prevention on an Individual Level and the Prevention Paradox
One of the primary examples which can be used to show the diﬀerence between indi‐
vidual and population risk levels is the ‘prevention paradox’ [38]. For any given aﬄic‐
tion, individuals categorized as ‘high risk’ make up a small minority of the aﬀected
population, greatly outnumbered by individuals whose risk is predicted to be average
or low because, compared to the overall population, the number of high-risk individuals
is generally low. As such, although the probability that individuals qualifying as high-
risk will suﬀer from their categorized aﬄiction is high, the probability that a given
individual will develop said aﬄiction in the high-risk category is still relatively low [38].
Diﬃculties of Individual Intervention. Individual risk is often diﬃcult to determine,
as risk factors for most of society’s common ailments are numerous, complexly corre‐
lated, and diﬃcult to determine as causative. This last point contributes to the diﬃculty
of inﬂuencing individual compliance: inciting behavioral change drastic enough to
perceptibly alter individual risk levels is a complex and unscientiﬁc procedure involving
individual appeal, personal devotion of time, eﬀort, and conscious thought. This is even
more diﬃcult to achieve when no deﬁnitive causality between future risk and current
behavior can be proven. Even when individual intervention succeeds in altering a single
person’s contribution to elevated risk factors, this has no perceptible impact on the
overall population prevalence of an aﬄiction given the number of individuals which
typically make up a population in such investigations [39].
5.2
Prevention at a Population Level
Prevention at a population level refers to the measures, which are taken by a population,
rather than at an individual basis to reduce the prevalence of a risk. This implies that
preventative measures are applied across a population, rather than evaluated as indi‐
vidual risk factors. As such, the aim of population-level prevention approaches is
focused on reducing the probability of a given risk, both for individuals who have been
identiﬁed to display elevated risk factors, and those whose risk levels are within normal
or even low ranges [39].
Methodology, Implementation and Eﬃcacy. Population level prevention may
include interventions at both community and national levels. Community prevention
includes local regulations, such as legislative restrictions or price increases associated
with products or activities. National level prevention is used to describe mass distribu‐
tion of health and safety information, which governments or private groups use to convey
messages to the public, with the goal of encouraging behavioral change. National level
risk intervention has been shown to be measurably more eﬀective than community level
risk prevention approaches, which in turn is more eﬀective than individual prevention
measures [39].

5.3
Case Study: Vaccinations
Of all the controversies, which have surrounded medical treatments and scientiﬁc
advancement, vaccinations are perhaps the most factually supported by both scientiﬁc
and medical communities. Recently, populations have become progressively more
susceptible to massive disease outbreaks as they become more urbanized and intercon‐
nected. Global interconnection among urban centers begs the question – how have
massive outbreaks of deadly pathogens been circumvented in the past decades?
The last decades have experienced notable scares –Ebola, avian ﬂu, H1N1 virus, and
MRSA all worth mention – but thus far, there have been no modern pathogens, which
scourge the population in the manner that the “Black Plague” aﬀected Europe. While
advancements in medical treatments undoubtedly play a role in this, medical, scientiﬁc
and statistical evidence all strongly indicate one inevitable truth: population-wide vacci‐
nations have advanced the human condition in relation to pathogenic, communicable
diseases. Data show signiﬁcant decreases in infections of previously devastating, debil‐
itating diseases including smallpox, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria,
varicella, and multiple strains of hepatitis [40].
While individual treatments for these conditions are available with more or less
success depending on the individual case, population-wide prevention measures have
signiﬁcantly reduced the spread and propagation of these pathogens on a scale previously
unimaginable and practically impossible while using only individual-level reactionary
treatments [40]. However, with the current anti-vaccination movement in the United
States and other parts of the world, some diseases that had previously been eradicated
are reemerging, such as the Disneyland measles outbreak in 2015 [41]. In India, suspi‐
cion of the West also has sparked aversion to vaccinations [42].

Abstract. Gold mining is a major economic activity in the Philippines par-
ticipated in by large-scale, artisanal and small-scale entities. Small-scale gold
mining has been a source of opportunities for jobs and livelihood to thousands
of people. However, this sector is described as an informal and unregulated
industry with minimal standards. This situation has raised concerns on risks that
may affect its sustainability. Locally, a working organization is required to
undergo self-assessment and inspection. In the absence of a risk assessment tool,
this paper presents the development of this tool for a systematic examination and
identiﬁcation of the hazards on small-scale gold mining in the Philippines. To
assess its usability, ofﬁcials of the Provincial Environmental Natural Resources
Ofﬁce and the miners/operators used the tool at sites engaged in surface,
underground or compressor mining. The results showed low compliance to
standards and violations for the gold small-scale mining activities is due to the
lack of information regarding the standards. It also showed that the top hazards
identiﬁed in speciﬁc site depends on the choice of mining and extraction pro-
cesses. Based on user evaluation, the risk assessment tool is effective, easy to
learn and covers most hazards in small-scale mining in the Philippines.

Introduction
Small-scale gold mining in the Philippines contributes to employment and the
Philippines’ Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Employment is one of the most obvious
result of gold mining. According to Kippenberg, the number of people working in
small-scale gold mining is estimated at 200,000 to 300,000 in 2014 [1]. Other con-
tributions of small-scale gold mining are the Gross Domestic Product input of the
Philippines. From 1998 until 2002, there was a decline in large-scale mineral pro-
duction, both metallic and non-metallic. According to AGHAM, the small-scale sector
has been the “saving grace” of the mining industry [2]. It has registered an average
percent contribution of 28.7% in the total gross production value, and the production
made by informal small-scale miners, whose extracted ores were sold to the black
market and unaccounted by the Central Bank, are not even included [3].

There is an apparent high accident rate in small scale gold mining. Due to
under-reporting, there are insufﬁcient data on the number of deaths and accidents that
occurred in small-scale mines in the Philippines. The majority of the small-scale gold
miners in the Philippines are unregulated and the risks of accidents are high [4].
A compilation of mining accident reports created by GMA News showed that 87.5% of
these mining accidents are in small-scale gold mining [5].
The Philippines’ Department of Labor and Employment Order No. 57-04 [6],
stipulates the guidelines on effective implementation of labor standards enforcement. In
Sect. 1, the Labor Standards Enforcement Framework shall ensure compliance with
labor standards by self assessment and inspection. Therefore, the distribution of
checklist on compliance with labor standards for self-assessment had to be conducted.
In line with DOLE 57-04, a risk assessment tool is necessary for these organizations to
evaluate their performance, to avoid further accidents in the future and to ensure safety
of the miners. This will also be helpful for the implementation of inspection and
self-assessment of the Philippine government.
A risk assessment tool is required to have a detailed and systematic examination to
identify and evaluate the work environmental hazards in the gold small-scale mining
and operations. This tool is useful to prioritize the risks and evaluate their current
controls. In this way, miners, tunnel owners, operators, and the local government units
(LGU) will be able to implement safety improvements.

Methodology
2.1
Model Development
There are six main hazards and are required to be observed and evaluated in any
working environment according to OSHA of United States Department of Labor [7].
These are safety hazards, chemical and dust hazards, physical hazards, biological
hazards, ergonomic hazards, and work organization hazards. These hazards were then
matched to the hazards observed in different small scale gold mining sites.
At the sites observed, the processes in extracting ores, capturing gold, and reﬁning
gold were determined. Hazards in each process were then recorded. Table 1 shows the
different processes used in the six sites observed. The processes observed in the sites
have some similarities and combination of processes, hence similar hazards.
A preliminary set of risk assessment template was created and matched to the
standards required for small-scale mining from DENR Administrative Order for
Small-Scale Mining No. 97-30 [8] and Philippine Occupational Health and Safety [9].
Figure 1 illustrates the framework of the developed risk assessment tool. Hazards were
grouped according to the nature of the hazards.
2.2
Model Application
In order to validate the risk assessment tool, PENRO (Provincial/Municipal Environ-
ment and Natural Resources Ofﬁcers) and miners were invited to use the tool. Three
main sites were visited: Site X with compressor mining, Site Y with surface mining,

naires were answered and the tool was rated according to its usability. Cohen’s Kappa
was used to check the agreement of assessors to show the existence of individual biases
on the level of risk [10].

Results and Discussion
3.1
Compliance to Safety Standards and Control
The results of the validation shown in Table 2 indicated the percentage of compliance
to safety standards used in the risk assessment, percentage of non-compliance to safety
standards, and percentage of standards that are not applicable to the process used in the
validation Site X and Site Y.
Using the risk assessment tool, in Site X, the PENRO noted that 30% do not
comply to the given standards in the tool. Only 17% complied and the rest are not
applicable to answer. One of the reason for this result is that compressor mining is
prohibited by law. Therefore, only few DAO safety standards are applicable and the
rest are not covered by DAO97-30.
In Site Y have 32% complied in terms of compliance to safety regulations of
small-scale mining in the Philippines. They also failed 46% in terms of following other
standards and regulations from Occupational Health and Safety and International Labor
Organization’s Safety in small scale mining. One of the reasons why they commit
violations is that they do not know the standards. As noted during the interview that
they never heard of DAO97-30 and they have not used any risk assessment tool before.
3.2
Strength of Agreement of the Risk Level
To validate the strength of agreement of risk, Cohen’s Kappa was used. Table 3 shows
their agreement to High Risk, Medium, Low Risk level of hazards in the site.

Kappa for Sites X, Y and Z.

In Site X, the miners both agreed with k = 0.88 which means, almost perfect.
The PENRO and miner show a very poor agreement of k = −0.039, which means that
they do not agree at all. In Site Y, the two PENROs agreed well with k = 0.889, but the
PENROs and miners have fair agreement that ranges from k equal to 0.23 to 0.26. In
Site Z, the results show k = 0.098 which shows weak agreement on the degree of risk.
This implies that the PENRO feels that hazards have different degrees compared to the
miners. Therefore, there are gaps between the knowledge and experiences of the miners
and PENROs. In the interview conducted, they noted their differences in safety
knowledge and exposure in mining.
3.3
Usability Test
A usability questionnaire was used after using the risk assessment tool. It is measured
in three parts: effectiveness, learnability, and satisfaction of the tool. Table 4 shows the
average rating given by the assessors ranging between 4.4 (highest) and 3.4 (lowest).
A high rating was given on the representation of current hazards in the risk
assessment tool. Assessors agree that the tool has a satisfying content. They gave a
rating of 4–5 on effectivity and learnability. In general, when using the risk assessment
tool, assessors might have different perceptions but all of them have acknowledged the
immediate need for the tool, and have given a high rating on its usability namely in its
content and learnability.

Conclusion
The risk assessment tool was developed, tested and improved during the course of this
study. Using the tool, the assessment results show that the PENRO representatives have
identiﬁed the percentage compliance of gold small-scale mining to be low. Follow up
interviews showed that low compliance and violations of the miners are due to the lack
of information regarding the standards set by government. It also showed that the top
hazards identiﬁed in speciﬁc site depends on the process of mining of ores (e.g. surface
mining) and ways of extracting gold (e.g. use of mercury).
Furthermore, analysis from Cohen’s kappa of the responses showed gaps between
the PENRO and the miners in terms of risk evaluation. Lastly, based on user evalua-
tion, the risk assessment tool is effective, easy to learn and covers most hazards in
small-scale mining in the Philippines. Hence, the tool is useful as a self-assessment and
inspection tool for small-scale gold mining.

Abstract. The construction sector has a set of very specific and unique characteris‐
tics that demarcate it from all other sectors. This is associated with a strong precari‐
ousness and labor turnover, plus the widespread practice of subcontracting. The perti‐
nence of the study carried out is framed in the necessity of evaluating and valuing the
management indicators, through accident rates that are statistically valid. In order to
obtain the indices as a function of sectoral and market management variables, several
statistical models were developed with the capacity to predict the behavior of these
indices. Exogenous variables, such as the unemployment rate and the GDP growth
rate of Portugal, were included for this purpose. These statistical models function as
predictive models, provided that the coefficients of the independent variables are
significant. Linear regressions were used because, due to the temporal shortage of
data, the other types of regression would hardly prove to be robust. Also, were tested
dozens of models, and the overwhelming majority did not show any statistical signif‐
icance. Nevertheless, we obtained 3 (three) partially significant multiple linear regres‐
sion models. Thus, as a final result of this work, it was verified that only (2) two
models, demonstrated to have good predictability and reliability for future use. Being
that these appear as relevant variables, the unemployment rate and the training costs
per worker. These models can be used by companies in the industry, such as tools for
the prevention of accidents at work.

Introduction
The construction sector has a whole set of very speciﬁc and unique features that demar‐
cate all other sectors. This is associated with a strong precariousness and labor turnover,
plus the widespread practice of sub-contracting [4].

Perhaps we can not talk about work accidents without addressing the issue of
working conditions in which it is carried out in space and surrounding environment. As
well as the adequacy of the conditions of professional performance in the particularities
of each task developed. Everything always translates into risks for the workers.
According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), where there is work, there
is a risk. Given that the number of work accidents is evidenced in the widely-known
statistics [6].
According to Kartman’s study, construction work accidents are at the root of many
human tragedies. Discouraging workers, inter-break the building process, aﬀect
adversely the costs, productivity and reputation of this industry, as well as delaying the
progress of society [3].
When the accident statistics are analyzed, there are sectors of activity, where the
probability of occurrence of the accident at work, as well as the severity of its conse‐
quence is higher. As is the case of the construction sector, where it is imperative to take
up measures and actions aimed at reducing and/or minimize these statistics sustainably.
These black numbers mean a catastrophe in social and economic terms for the whole
community, without exception [5].
Faced with this problem and considering safety in the construction a vital mission
and of primordial meaning for the society in general, it was intended with the present
study to develop a mathematical model. That has the ability to explain the behavior of
a given variable due to several sectoral and market variables. It is intended that this will
serve as a support tool in making decisional actions of top management of companies
in this sector. Since to predict what its loss ratio, allows the possibility of a timely and
eﬀective planning of investments in prevention and OHS in oﬃce and the workplace.
The relevance of the study conducted relates to the need to assess and enhance the
management indicators, through loss ratios that may be statistically valid. To obtain the
rates due to sectoral management and market variables were developed various statis‐
tical models with behavior prediction capacity of these same indices. To this end, it
included exogenous variables, such as the unemployment rate and the growth rate of
GDP of Portugal. With the introduction of the variable unemployment rate, it allowed
the creation of models that depended on an exogenous and economic variable.
These statistical models act as predictive models and can be used by companies in
the sector as potential tools for the prevention of occupational accidents.

Materials and Methods
In this sense, the construction of a ﬁrst version of the accident rates, resulted from a
selection of common variables in diﬀerent organizations. That come from a cross-
sectional survey among members of a business association (BA) of the Construction
and Public Works sector, complemented by others from a state entity.
These socio-economic and ﬁnancial variables were collected through an oﬃcial
questionnaire that was applied to the various business organizations of diﬀerent dimen‐
sions (staﬀ and annual turnover), which constitute this association.

In the development of this work were applied diﬀerent methodological approaches
that are based on three components of fundamental bibliographic research:
Scientiﬁc Component: Consultation and analysis of several articles and scientiﬁc
papers with peer review, as basis for framing and orientation of the theme and proposed
objectives.
Legal Component: Support in diverse legal and normative diplomas, as much at the
historical level as at the present time. In order to sustain the development of this work
in the guidelines issued by the bodies that oversee and supervise the rights and working
conditions, both nationally and internationally.
Technical Component: Research and study of several statistical models, of treatment
and data analysis.
Which are also supported in ﬁve phases improvement continuous, as shown in Fig. 1.
Fig. 1. Phases of the applied methodology, based on continuous improvement cycle [6].
Phase I: Planning and deﬁnition of the variables and statistical indicators, leading to
the completion of the study - Deﬁnition of key stakeholders, what are their objectives
and what kind of inﬂuence will they have on the ﬁnal results. Establishing the objective
of the evaluation and the results to be achieved; Planning of the necessary activities and
deﬁnition of the time period for carrying out the research.
Phase II: Collection and sorting of data from the questionnaire, to characterize the
sample and consequent exploratory study - The deﬁcit of records related to work acci‐
dents was one of the greatest diﬃculties in the accomplishment of this study, having as
consequence the necessity of its evaluation of form Indirect. Choice of variables in order

to achieve the purpose of evaluation. For this are selected those for which data are
available, easy to obtain and have the desired accuracy.
Phase III: Treatment and analysis of statistical data - Use of data already available,
originating from statistical collection systems for oﬃcial treatment. It is also used to
extrapolate data so that the ﬁnal result is as faithful as possible to the situation under
study. The aim is to determine what is related to work accidents and what their degree
of intervention is, in order to quantify their eﬀects through analysis techniques.
Phase IV: Development of mathematical models, based on variables with statistical
reliability - In this phase the values obtained are related to variables related to work
accidents.
Phase V: Testing and validation of mathematical models with application to practical
cases - Regarding the results, proceed with due consideration to interpretation. When‐
ever possible, it addresses references and assumptions, objectives, and limitations of
data credibility. Due to this it will be necessary to use qualitative and explanatory sensi‐
tivity analyzes. To draw conclusions and evaluate the eﬀects of interpretations of the
results obtained. Depending on the results obtained, it evaluates the need to apply a new
cycle of continuous improvement of the socio-economic assessment of accidents at
work, taking into consideration that the new variables selected are representative of
reality in the study.
2.1
Questionnaire
The information was collected through the questionnaire and treated for statistical
purposes in the present research work. The questionnaire is divided into six sections that
cover: (0) General Business Organization Information, (1) Employability Conditions,
(2) Personnel Costs, (3) Occupational Health and Safety, (4) Professional Training and
(5) Complementary Social Protection.
2.2
General Sample Characterization
The questionnaire was applied to a representative sample of 58 companies in the
Construction and Public Works sector belonging to a business association (BA). Group
A: more than 1000 workers, Group B: between 501 and 1000 workers, Group C: between
101 and 500 workers and D: less than 100 Workers) for the study period.
At the geographical level this covers the territory of mainland Portugal, and corre‐
sponds to an annual average of 21,190 workers (approximately 10% of sectorial employ‐
ability at national level). The reference period was deﬁned between the years 2002 and
2007. Or in aggregate terms (between the Sinistrality and Training indices) is a sample
with 6 elements (in temporal terms). It can, in some cases, be broader and/or shorter,
given the data provided by the entities.
The sectoral level is on the activities of the section and subsection F of the NACE
Revision 3, including the sector of Construction and Public Works.

2.3
Methodology of Processing and Analysis of Data
The raw and sectoral data collected were provided by a business association (BA),
complemented by others provided by a state entity. They are relating to two diﬀerent
periods (1997–2007 and 2002–2007) with a common range. These include: investment
in training; Assiduity; The number of workers; Number of training courses per
employee; Participation rates in training actions; Costs of training actions per worker
and participation; Percentage of workers covered by training in relation to the total,
medical examinations per 100 workers, hours of training, accident rates and others.
The data obtained through the questionnaire, were treated with the software SPSS
17.0. In all tests performed, the 95% conﬁdence level was used. And a test value greater
than 0.05 (p > 0.05) which, if the value was lower than the hypothesis, was rejected.
Considering that small samples (less than 30 elements) were present, the Shapiro-
Wilk test was applied to verify the normality of the data and verify if the behavior of
each variable followed the Normal law. If so, the t (Student) test was used. This test was
used to verify if two variables (for example, two of the accident rates) presented equal
or diﬀerent behaviors at the level of the mean value. If the test is signiﬁcant then there
is a high probability that your means are diﬀerent.
Given that we are facing small samples (less than 30 elements), the Shapiro-Wilk
test was used to assess the normality of the data and verify that the behavior of each
variable followed the Normal law. If so, the t (Student) test was used. This test was used
to verify if two variables (for example, two of the accident rates) presented equal or
diﬀerent behaviors at the level of the mean value. If the test is signiﬁcant then there is
a high probability that your means are diﬀerent.

Results and Discussion
As can be seen from the overall objective of the study, this study aims not only to show
that there are relations between certain variables, but also to try to quantify them.
However, as a result of the treatment, only those referring to the Training showed stat‐
istical reliability. Due to this situation and to continue its study, exogenous variables
were included, such as the unemployment rate and the growth rate of the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP). To try to explain the behavior of the accident rates.
These statistical models function as predictive models as long as the coeﬃcients of
independent variables are signiﬁcant. To determine the results, the following steps were
followed:
Step 1: Linear regressions were used due to the temporal shortage of the data (samples
at 6 years), since the other types of regression would hardly prove to be solid.
Step 2: The choice of variables followed a process of trial and error. Thus we started
with endogenous variables, including and removing several variables. But after
the impossibility of obtaining multiple linear regression models with them, the
GDP growth rate and the unemployment rate were chosen as exogenous vari‐
ables.

379

Step 3: These choices were related to the notion that Construction is above all an
economic activity with a signiﬁcant weight in Portuguese GDP. Thus, the
behavior of GDP could be expected to inﬂuence the activity of the sector, as
well as the unemployment rate. These will serve as a complementary indicator
of economic progress. Thus, dozens of models were tested until ﬁve (5) were
statistically valid.
Step 4: Finally the validation of the non-rejected models was carried out. In this way,
3 (three) partially signiﬁcant multiple linear regression models (no. 1, 3 and 4)
were obtained, 1 (one) statistically signiﬁcant simple linear regression model
and 1 (one) model No. 5) of statistically signiﬁcant multiple linear regression.
Of the ﬁve (5) models obtained, paragraphs 1 and 4 were rejected because there was
at least one statistically insigniﬁcant coeﬃcient. Therefore, the three (3) models that
demonstrated statistical reliability were presented below:
Model No. 2 - Sectoral Incidence Index - Variable: Unemployment Rate (X1):
IIncid̂encia(AE) = 14,891 −0,990X1
(1)
Model No. 3 - Sectoral Severity Index - Variables: Unemployment Rate (X1), Partic‐
ipation Rate in Training Shares (X2) and Training Hours (X3):
IGravidade(AE) = −1, 129X1 + 0, 997X2 + 0, 548X3
(2)
Model No. 5 - Sectoral Severity Index -Variables: Unemployment Rate (X1), Training
Costs per Worker (X2):
IGravidade(AE) = 2, 281 −0, 431X1 + 0, 010X2
(3)
Later, the validation of the models was veriﬁed by verifying the extent to which the
values observed in the companies of the accident rates (where the models were statis‐
tically signiﬁcant) would deviate or approximate the values predicted by the models.
The following is the graphical analysis of the validation of the models that were statis‐
tically valid:
As can be seen from Fig. 2, the error (diﬀerence between the predicted value and the
observed value) is never very high. The predicted value is practically coincident with
the value observed in 4 of the 6 years, reason why it is considered to be a model with
good predictability and of great future reliability.
When analyzing the graph of Fig. 3, it is veriﬁed that in most of the predicted values
of the Severity Index are almost always negative, which is absurd, reason why the model
should be rejected.

Regarding the model no. 5, this one presents values of the Gravity Index also very
close to those observed. This means that in the period between 2002 and 2007 the
severity index does not deviate from the values predicted by this model. In that the
explanatory variables are the unemployment rate of Portugal veriﬁed in that year and
the training costs per worker. From the analysis made to the graph of Fig. 4, it can be
seen that the values are practically coincident in every year. If there is only one (very
slight) departure in 2006 (where the observed value is very slightly higher than
expected), it is considered to be a very reliable model for future use.

Conclusion
From the results presented in this work, it can be seen that only models no. 2 and 5 have
shown great reliability for future use. Given that the actual ﬁgures are practically coin‐
cident with those foreseen for each year. In these, the unemployment rate and training
costs per worker appear as relevant variables.
Regarding this last variable, already in 2009, Costa, questioned the eﬀectiveness of
training for a very signiﬁcant number of companies surveyed for their study. It was
veriﬁed that the statistical models used had an apparently neutral or even negative eﬀect
of the OHS training regarding the accident rate [1].
That is to say, a greater investment in training corresponded to an increase in the
number of accidents at work. Although statistically valid, it was concluded that these
results could not be related to the training itself, but to its quality. Even so, since they
have no eﬀect on workers, they do not promote Prevention and Security, making the
investments made completely irrecoverable. On the contrary, the investment in occu‐
pational health and safety technicians would have a positive return [2].
With regard to the conclusions drawn in the present study with a completely diﬀerent
sample and in another industrial sector, the conclusion is the same in investments made
in training. In other words, it was veriﬁed through model 5 that, statistically, the partic‐
ipation rate in training actions has a direct eﬀect on the severity index of work-related
accidents among BA associates. It was concluded that an increase in the participation
382
P. Oliveira et al.

rate in training actions would lead to an increase in the incidence rate. It is understood
that the more workers involved in training and/or more hours of training, the more work-
related accidents would occur. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate would have an
inverse eﬀect on this index, that is, an increase in the unemployment rate causes the
index to decrease. This second reading is supported by model no. 2, which shows that
the increase in the unemployment rate has a beneﬁcial eﬀect on the incidence index.
That is, an increase in the unemployment rate causes it to decrease. Conclusion also
unfavorable.
These results are highly troubling and, once again, strongly question the quality of
the training given in companies. As well as the legal model in this area is deﬁned. It
proves once again that it is not enough to give training, but that the fundamental one is
its adequacy to the reality of each company. With the risk, here proven, of the complete
lack of return on investment made under these conditions.

Abstract. Non-wearable sensors utilizing advanced image-processing and
sensing technologies for capturing an individual’s behavior in real-world settings
are now available. Wearable sensors are diﬃcult to use, especially for long-term
recordings, because the batteries for these sensors must be exchanged or
recharged. Behavioral data collected using non-wearable sensors can be used for
precision nursing, which indicates individualized risk management and interven‐
tion plan based on the understanding of individual risk and other health status. In
this study, we applied the developed non-wearable technologies to evaluate a
person’s gait ability, which is an important factor for creating a fall prevention
program.

Introduction
Falls can cause serious injuries such as bone fractures in elderly individuals, sometimes
rendering them bedridden. Falls are actually the second leading cause of accidental death
worldwide, and the highest number of fatalities from falls are among people 65 years
of age and older. The decline in physical function associated with aging puts elderly
people at a higher risk of falls, and many of them may end up requiring long-term care.
In a long-term care facility, care personnel or professional caregivers assist residents
with special needs to maintain or even improve their health. However, elderly individ‐
uals injured from a fall could suﬀer substantial declines in their physical as well as
cognitive function, which would negatively aﬀect their quality of life.
Technological advances now make it possible to collect and analyze data on people’s
movements to reveal potential risk factors for falls. Wearable sensor systems have been
used to identify fall risks in many research studies, but capturing behaviors in real-world
settings using wearable sensors is diﬃcult because the batteries of these sensors must
be exchanged or recharged. Consequently, non-wearable sensors utilizing advanced
image-processing and sensing technologies are more suitable for capturing an individ‐
ual’s behavior over extended periods. Data collected using these non-wearable sensors
will allow us to conduct “precision nursing” which identiﬁes individual health risks

(e.g., fall risks) and creates individualized intervention programs (e.g., fall prevention
program).
In the United States, approximately 37.3 million falls that require medical care occur
annually, and 20 to 30% of the injuries are classiﬁed as mild to severe. The risk of falls
increases as people age, probably due to changes in physical, mental, and sensory func‐
tioning [1].
According to the Tokyo Fire Department of Japan, falls account for approximately
270,000 emergency transports among people 65 years of age and older each year in
Tokyo [2]. The national total for elderly individuals requiring emergency transport due
to falls is likely more than 10 times this amount, as 90% of Japan’s population lives
outside the Tokyo metropolitan area. Hayashi estimated that medical and long-term care
for fall injuries in the elderly population cost as much as 900 billion yen annually [3].
The risk factors for falls vary but can be categorized into three types: (1) personal
factors including physical and mental health conditions, (2) external factors including
medications such as sleeping pills and psychotherapeutic drugs, and (3) environmental
factors such as the types of care equipment used and care provided by caregivers [4].
Some researchers have examined the relationship between falls and personal factors.
For instance, in our previous study, we found that people with symptoms of dementia
have a higher risk of falling when excited compared to people without dementia. [5].
Soyano reported that people with visuospatial cognitive dysfunction have a higher risk
of falls because their ability to recognize the positional relationship between objects is
diminished [6].
As for the relationship between falls and depression, which is a common symptom
of dementia, Stalenhoef and colleagues reported that elderly people who are in a depres‐
sive state and have fallen twice before have an increased risk of subsequent falls [7]. In
terms of physical ability, one study found an association between slow walking speed
and falls [8], and another study pointed out that the action of changing direction is the
most common cause of falls [9].
Regarding external factors, falls have been shown to be aﬀected by medications that
cause dizziness, drowsiness, convulsions, and numbness. These medications include
antipsychotic medications, anxiolytics, antidepressants, sleeping pills, and antiepileptic
drugs [10]. Moreover, Nevitt et al. reported that approximately two-thirds of people who
had experienced falls fell again within a year [11].
Recent research has turned to investigating the use of non-wearable sensors for
monitoring behavior. Robinovich et al. installed cameras in two long-term care facilities
and collected data on 227 falls from 130 people over nearly three years [12]. Their results
showed that the most common cause of falls was incorrect weight shifting, followed by
a trip or stumble, hit or bump, loss of support, and ﬁnally collapse. They also revealed
that forward walking, standing quietly, and sitting down were strongly associated with
falls.
The purpose of this study was to develop and operate a behavior monitoring system
for recording the natural walking of elderly individuals. We analyzed the data to under‐
stand the mechanism of falls by clarifying the relationship between gait and a person’s
level of cognitive and physical function.

Method
We conducted an observational study between October 2016 and March 2017. We
collaborated with three nursing facilities in Japan and installed three RGB-D sensors
(Microsoft Kinect v2) on the ceilings (height: 5 m) of hallways and common spaces at
each facility.
In 2016, we constructed “a smart living lab” with numerous embedded sensors for
collecting behavioral data using artiﬁcial intelligence-based sensing technologies.
Figure 1 shows a map of the smart living lab, and Fig. 2 shows the actual lab. Currently,
over 10 RGB-D cameras and 200 ultrasonic location sensors are installed in this lab.
Before we installed the sensors in the actual nursing facilities for collecting behavioral
data from elderly participants, we conﬁrmed the eﬀectiveness of non-wearable sensing
technology in the smart living lab.

Technology (AIST) in Japan

We recorded the activity at the nursing facilities 24 h a day. Figure 3 shows the ﬂoor
plan of one facility that has a maximum capacity of nine residents. The numbered blue
stars indicate the locations of the three camera sensors. Example screenshots from videos
recorded at the facility are shown in Fig. 4.

Twenty-two elderly people (4 men and 18 women) participated in this study. We
used the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and the Barthel Index (BI) to assess
each participant’s level of cognitive and physical function, respectively. Speciﬁcally, to
assess one’s cognitive level using MMSE, each participant ﬁlled MMSE questionnaire.
To assess one’s physical level using BI, care personnel assessed his or her physical level
based on their observation.

The Non-wearable Sensing System
Figure 5 shows the conﬁguration of the non-wearable sensing system, which consists
of RGB-D cameras, a face recognition engine, a registered person identiﬁcation engine,
and individualized data storage. The key idea lies in the combination of RGB-D cameras
and face recognition technology so we can individualize data collection without wear‐
able sensors. The stored data will allow us to conduct precision nursing care and preci‐
sion risk management, which are new methodologies customized for each individual.

Results
In residential care facility H, all nine residents agreed to participate in the study. The
total monitoring time was approximately 3,548 h. In residential care facility S, seven of
the nine residents agreed to participate, and were monitored for approximately 3,504 h.
In nursing home C, an adult daycare facility, six elderly people participated in the study.
In facility C, we monitored participants for approximately 1,160 h because nursing care
was provided only during the daytime (Table 1).
We successfully collected and analyzed the walking speed data and observed the
changes in walking speed over time. For example, the average walking speed of an elderly
woman in facility H over three days was 0.9 m/s (Fig. 6). Her slowest walking speed was
observed between 7 am and 8 am each day: Day 1 = 0.62 m/s, Day 2 = 0.66 m/s,

Day 3 = 0.56 m/s (Fig. 7). The slowest walking speeds and corresponding dates and times
are outlined in red.

Discussion
We developed and operated a system that recorded the natural walking of elderly people
using Kinect sensors. While the timed up and go test has been used to evaluate the gait
ability in elderly people, it only measures the time required to walk a certain distance
and return to a seated position. Other factors, such as a person’s posture and his or her
circadian variations in walking speed should be taken into account when evaluating gait.
We found that the walking speed of elderly participants at nursing facilities was not
constant but changed throughout the day. Particular behaviors such as walking while
looking at something or walking while holding something in one’s hand may inﬂuence
a person’s walking speed. Therefore, it will be interesting to analyze walking speed
based on diﬀerent types of behavior.
Analyses of the relationship between MMSE and BI indicated that most participants
were physically independent, but levels of cognitive function varied widely. Our hypoth‐
esis is that people with low cognitive function but high physical function are at the
highest risk for falls. We hope to gather more data to test this hypothesis and to analyze
the relationship between falls and the MMSE/BI relationship.
5
Conclusion
We installed Kinect sensors in three nursing facilities and captured real-life walking
behaviors of elderly people. We successfully analyzed the walking speed for each indi‐
vidual and observed circadian variations in walking speed. In a future study, we hope
to identify gait patterns in elderly individuals and fall risks based on these patterns.
Moreover, we hope to reveal the relationship between a person’s cognitive and physical
function based on MMSE and BI scores and walking speed and to develop a precision
nursing program using non-wearable sensor data.

Abstract. The study of the occupational thermal environment must take into
account the need to obtain acceptable conditions in terms of health and comfort.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate thermal comfort in a meat pro-
cessing industry. Measurements of temperature, relative humidity and air
velocity were carried out for all workstations. Measurements (N = 21) were
performed during 5 min, for each thermal amplitude, with the presence of the
worker after analyses of workers clothing. After the measurements, “Predicted
Mean Vote” and “Predicted Percentage of Dissatisﬁed” were calculated, for a
subsequent proposal of prevention and protection measures. The results
demonstrate the need to implement preventive measures to mitigate possible
health effects for workers exposed to various thermal environments (design,
organizational, material/structural, personal protection and medical surveil-
lance). In conclusion an inadequate thermal environment can rise to psycho-
logical discomfort, absenteeism, reduced productivity, increased frequency of
accidents and physiological effects.

Introduction
The study of the thermal environment in the workplace should meet the need to obtain
acceptable conditions in terms of health and comfort and be suitable for the human
organism, depending on the production process [1].
Human requirements of thermal comfort are related to the functioning of the
organism, whose mechanism can be compared to a thermal machine that produces heat
according to its activity. Man needs to release enough heat so that its internal tem-
perature stays about 37 °C [2]. This phenomenon is called homeothermia (maintenance
of internal body temperature), which ensures optimal functioning of the main functions
of the body and in particular of the central nervous system. Homeothermia is ensured
when the heat ﬂow, produced by the body, is equal to the heat ﬂow delivered to the
environment [2, 3].

Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing 604, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-60525-8_41

In certain thermal environments, the equality of the heat ﬂows can take place in a
pleasant and non-burdensome way for man - it is the so-called neutral or comfortable
environment. Outside of this neutral environment, the body may continue to maintain
homeothermia, but at the price of certain physiological or behavioral reactions intended
to adjust the thermal equilibrium [3].
A neutral or comfortable environment is an environment that allows metabolic heat
production to equilibrate with heat exchanges (losses and/or gains) from the air around
the worker. In this situation (when heat exchanges between the human body and the
environment occur without greater effort), workers sense thermal comfort and his work
capacity is maximum [2].
Outside of this equilibrium situation, that is, if the environmental sensations cause
more or less heat than is necessary for the homogeny (which happens to be achieved
with additional effort that represents overload) causing a decrease in performance at
work [2]. In these situations of thermal stress, induced by heat or cold, can constitute a
risk to the health of workers, since even taking into account the thermoregulation
mechanisms of the organism, they cannot keep the internal temperature constant and
adequate [4].
1.1
Types of Thermal Environments
Neutral Thermal Environment. A neutral thermal environment is an environment in
which metabolic heat production is balanced by the waste of sensible heat (con-vection,
radiation, conduction), respiratory heat loss, and insensitive perspiration, without the
individual having a need to ﬁght against heat or cold.
A comfortable environment is a neutral environment for which the physiological
parameters that determine the sensation of heat have an optimum value. These phys-
iological parameters are the skin temperature average and the rate of sweating.
The physiological conditions of stable thermal comfort are thermal equilibrium:
neither storage nor heat loss; absence of chills; optimal sweating rate; optimal mean
skin temperature (function of the metabolic level); relatively dry skin (skin whitening
less than 60%); absence of dryness of buccopharyngeal mucosae (partial water vapor
pressure of more than 1.5 kPa) [3].
Hot Thermal Environment. The hot thermal environments are environments for
which the heat balance, calculated on the basis of the heat exchanges by radiation and
convection, is positive. The body must, therefore, activate the different means of
ﬁghting against heat.
Several reasons can lead to a situation of thermal stress: increased metabolism;
increased air temperature; increase in radiant temperature average; modiﬁcation of the
air velocity when its temperature is higher than the skin temperature average; increased
air humidity.
To try to rebalance the thermal balance, the organism reacts fundamentally through
three processes called physiological overloads:
394
J.S. Guerreiro et al.

– Thermostatic overload: the skin temperature increases, the internal temperature
more slowly; the increase of the cutaneous temperature allows to optimize the heat
exchanges by convection and by radiation between the skin and the environment.
– Circulatory overload: the difference between the internal temperature and the skin
temperature decreases, which means an increase in the physiological conductance,
that, in turn, is ensured by an increase in cutaneous blood ﬂow.
– Sweating overload: the optimization of convection and radiation heat exchanges
obtained by an increase in skin temperature is not enough to ensure a thermal
equilibrium. The body then possesses sweating, which, through the skin’s wetting,
allows to maintain a certain evaporating ﬂow [3].
Cold Thermal Environment. The cold environments are the thermal environments
for which the thermal balance, calculated on the basis of the convective and radiant
changes, is negative. The body must therefore activate the different means against the
cold. With the exception of air humidity, the set of environmental parameters may be at
the origin of such an imbalance. To try to maintain a near-zero thermal balance,
different reactions of the organism can be observed:
– Thermostatic overload: low skin temperature in order to reduce the difference
between skin temperature and ambient temperature, contributing to the reduction of
convective and radiant losses.
– Circulatory overload: as the difference between the rectal temperature and the
cutaneous temperature increases, due to lowering of the skin temperature, it is
advisable to reduce the physiological conductance of the body. Such a reduction is
achieved by reduction of cutaneous blood ﬂow.
– Metabolic overload: if these two adjustments are not enough, the body is forced to
increase metabolism in order to compensate for excessive heat losses. This increase
in metabolism occurs, exclusively in the skeletal muscles: ﬁrst occurs an increase of
muscle tone; secondly the appearance of chills. Metabolism can be multiplied by 5
in the ﬁght against cold [3].
1.2
Types of Response to Different Thermal Environments
Thermal Comfort. The man is a warm-blooded animal that needs to maintain the
internal temperature of the body (brain, heart and organs of the abdomen) in order to
survive. Within very narrow limits, at a constant temperature of 37 °C, forcing a
constant search for equilibrium between the man and the surrounding environment. It
has an inﬂuence on this internal temperature, and a slight deviation from this value can
lead to death.
When there is the psychological perception of this balance, one can speak of
thermal conformation, which is deﬁned by ISO 7730 as “a state of mind that expresses
satisfaction with the environment that surrounds a person (neither hot nor cold).” It is
therefore a subjective sensation that depends on the biological, physical and emotional
Thermal Environment: Case Study of a Meat Processing Industry
395

aspects of the occupants, and it is not possible to satisfy all the individuals who occupy
an enclosure space [4].
Thermoregulation plays a fundamental role in the thermal comfort, since it is a set
of mechanisms that allows to stabilize the body temperature of the animals against the
thermal variations of the external environment. This process is therefore essential for
living beings both in maintaining the rate of cellular metabolism and the integrity of the
organism.
Thermal comfort is a concept that cannot be precisely deﬁned. In order to have the
same environment with several people in different garments and to practice different
activities, it is difﬁcult to conceive a pleasant environment. The comfort zone is not
objective because it varies by people and depends on quantiﬁable factors such as air
temperature and humidity, and not quantiﬁable as habits and mental state.
Well-being, in the context of thermal comfort, means the lack of sensation of hot or
cold. When external conditions allows the thermal regulation mechanisms of an indi-
vidual to be reduced as much as possible, i.e., that the organism is in equilibrium with
the surrounding environment, a comfortable thermal environment is achieved [5].
Thermal Stress. Thermal stress, as opposed to the deﬁnition of thermal comfort, can
be understood as the parameter that tells us when the set of conditions by which the
human autoregulation mechanisms are maximal. It can be also deﬁned as the range of
thermal limits in which most of the people manifest extreme discomfort, since the
human capacities to withstand extreme temperatures are different from individual to
individual [6].
Thermal stress, either by high or low temperatures is manifested as a danger since
the capacity to ensure human physical health must maintain the internal temperature of
the body within limits quite strict, regardless of the variations that may occur in the
surrounding environment.
The physiological, psychological and even economic consequences of carelessness
in the creation of a thermally qualiﬁed environment are of various orders, highlighting
the capacity of human beings to adapt is not limitless.
There are six variables that inﬂuence thermal comfort and thus stress. The activity
performed (M) and the thermal insulation (clo) are the subjective variables. The
remaining variables are the so-called environmental variables where the air temperature
(T), the radiant temperature average (Tm), the air velocity (m/s) and, ﬁnally, the partial
pressure of the water vapor in the ambient air (Pa) [6].
The analysis of comfort or thermal stress in a workplace requires the knowledge of
physical quantities and characteristics of the considered environment. They are the air
temperature, air humidity, air velocity and radiant heat [4]
The aim of this study was to evaluate thermal comfort in a meat processing
industry, calculating PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) and PPD (Predicted Percentage of
Dissatisﬁed) and identify possible preventive and protection measures in the eventu-
ality of thermal discomfort.

Methods
The information gathered to support this research was based on case studies. This
methodology helps to understand why certain characteristics are observed in target
cases [7]. The applied study was of level I, of the descriptive-exploratory type.
In order to achieve the aim of this research, a thermal environment assessment was
carried out taking into account measurements to the followed variables, for all work-
stations: temperature, relative humidity and air velocity.
The number and duration of measurements were determined so that each mea-
surement was representative of the workplace and/or operation. Thus, measurements
were made with the following conditions:
– Deﬁnition of measuring points (N = 21), taking into account the established
workstations;
– Evaluation of 5 min, for each thermal amplitude;
– Evaluations carried out, whenever possible, with the presence of the worker at the
workplace;
– Analysis of each worker’s clothing to calculate the clothing thermal resistance index
and metabolism;
– Characterization of the physical conditions of the workplace.
The calculation of metabolism (M) and clothing thermal resistance index (Icl) was
based on the ISO 7730 (Ergonomics of the thermal environment - Analytical deter-
mination and interpretation of thermal comfort using calculation of the PMV and PPD
indices and local thermal comfort criteria).
For the collection of environmental data it was used the VelociCalc, brand TSI,
model 8347-M-GB. It was also used a globe thermometer and a tripod. After the
measurements carried out, the PMV and PPD indexes were calculated for a posteriori
proposal of preventive/corrective actions.

Results and Discussion
Physical Characterization of Space. As a meat-processing industry, the manufac-
turing plant in all its spaces has a controlled atmosphere. There are no windows or other
openings that allows the incidence of sunlight. The walls are lined with tiles. There is a
packaging warehouse that has no controlled atmosphere, as well as production ofﬁces.
Characterization of Workers. There are no workers in vulnerable situation as
identiﬁed by the Department of Occupational Health Services. Updated medical ﬁtness
records do not evidence workers conditioned.
All workers have vests and protective coats for low temperatures, rubber boots and
protective gloves. The worker, who develops his activity in the expedition zone and
freezing storage chamber, has his own thermal protection clothing, being considered in
this evaluation as: “heavy winter clothing”.

Twenty-one sites were evaluated in terms of air temperature, relative humidity, air
velocity and globe temperature. In those sites, Metabolism, Chothing Index, PMV and
PPD were also evaluated. The results, by work station, can be observed in Table 1.

In practice, given the results obtained in the evaluation carried out, it can be
veriﬁedthe existence of neutral, cold and hot thermal environments. Taking into con-
sideration the type of environment found in each task and the type of industry studied,
the following measures can be proposed:
Thermal Neutral Environment. The stations with neutral thermal environment were
workstations: 2, 4, 8 to 18.
Considering the type of activity and the thermal resistance of the clothing used,
values of PPD below 10% and values of PMV included in the range [−0.45; 0.09],
reﬂected neutral conditions.
It can be veriﬁed that, according to the values obtained in the evaluated workplaces,
the thermal environment is acceptable, i.e., a situation of thermal comfort.
In relation to the relative humidity of the air, considering the type of activity, the
measured values are within the range of recommended parameters.
Cold Thermal Environment. The measuring points 1, 3, 5 to 7, 19 and 20 presents a
thermal environment considered cold.
Considering the type of activity and the thermal resistance of the clothing used,
values of PPD above 10% and values of PMV included in the inter-value [−0.93;
+0.56], reﬂected slightly cold conditions.
Thus, according to the values obtained in the workplaces, the working environment
is within a situation of thermal discomfort, in which statistically 15% of the workers are
uncomfortable.
When environmental conditions provide for body heat losses, in addition to those
required to maintain its constant internal temperature, the organism reacts by means of
its automatic mechanisms - sympathetic nervous system - seeking to reduce losses and
increase internal combustion (performed through the endocrine glandular system) [2].
Excessive cold can reduce reaction time, increase tension, cause heart rhythm
disturbances, decrease sensitivity, hypothermia, and freeze [1].
When the heat transferred to the environment is higher than the heat received or
produced by means of the basal or working metabolism, the body tends to cool down
and, to avoid hypothermia (decrease of the body temperature), initiates multiple

mechanisms such as blood vasoconstriction (reducing the transfer of heat to the out-
side); sweat gland closure; decreased peripheral blood circulation; tiritona - heat pro-
duction (chemical transformation in mechanical/thermal); autophagy of stored fats
(chemical transformation of lipids to directly metabolized glycerides: shrinkage: pre-
sent the minimum surface of skin in contact with the exterior [3, 4].
The consequences of hypothermia can also be highlighted by the general feeling of
malaise; decreased manual dexterity, reduced tactile sensitivity; joint ankylosis;
extravagant behavior (hypothermia of the blood that irrigates the brain); freezing of
limbs (most affected, limbs); chilblains; erythrocyanosis; foot of the trenches; (tem-
peratures below −20 °C). Death occurs when the internal temperature is below 28 °C
due to heart failure [3, 4].
Exposure to cold from discovered parts (face, hands) causes an increase in blood
pressure and a decrease or increase in heart rate. These two effects are translated by an
increase of the work of the heart. For these reasons, individuals with cardiovascular
affections should not be exposed to cold, even protected.
Rheumatism appears more often in individuals exposed to cold. It is assumed that it
is the variations in the temperature of the mucous membranes that favor the appearance
of rheumatism, since the cooling of these favors, in principle, the penetration of virus
into the cells [4].
Since that, by the nature of the developed activity, and due to food safety regu-
lations and requirements, the air temperature cannot be increased, it is suggested:
– Provision of personal protective equipment to workers, namely thermal vests.
– Raising workers awareness of the risks they are exposed to;
– Rotativity of workers per job;
– Pauses;
– Ingestion of hot drinks;
– Use of warm clothing.
Hot thermal environment. The only workplace that present hot thermal environment
is the corresponding to the number 21 (main ofﬁce).
Considering the type of activity and the thermal resistance of the garments used,
values of PPD above 10% and value of PMV of 0.77 were obtained, reﬂected slightly
hot temperatures.
According to the values obtained in the evaluated place, it is faced the situation of
thermal discomfort, in which, 17.5% of workers are uncomfortable.
Regarding the relative humidity of the air, considering the type of activity, it is
slightly below the recommended values, in the measurement points 2 to 4.
When the heat losses are lower than those required to maintain the constant internal
temperature, the body reacts by means of its automatic mechanisms - sympathetic
nervous system - providing more intense heat exchange conditions between the
organism and the environment, and reducing combustion (through the endocrine
glandular system). The increase in heat losses to the environment occurs through
vasodilation and exudation [2].

Excessive heat can cause decreased performance, headaches, nausea, dizziness,
sweating, cardiac fatigue, mineral and water imbalance, burns, stimulus-reaction dis-
turbances, and thermal fatigue [1].
In addition to the above-mentioned effects, sweat deﬁciency is another possible
phenomenon. The symptoms consist of a feeling of heat, exhaustion, and the heart rate
can increase rapidly and eventually collapse. Also, heat edema (dilatation of the feet
and ankles) is another possible scenario, occurring mainly in non-acclimatized indi-
viduals. Finally, rashes can occur on any part of the body, but preferably in areas that
remain moist (e.g., groin and armpit). In these areas, non-evaporated sweat causes red
pimples or irritations of easy treatment, but they can cause infection if not treated [6].
The temperature and humidity of workplaces must be appropriate to the organi-
zation and take into account the working methods and physical constraints inherent in
the work.
If possible, the risks must be eliminated, preventing working under conditions or
climatic factors that exceed the values related to fatigue and thermal discomfort.
Measures of various types are known in terms of limiting the effects of risks [1]:
Design measures
– Ensure the quality of design, acquisition and maintenance of ventilation and air
conditioning systems;
– Localized ventilation and aspiration;
– Forecasting the needs of hot air inﬂation in cold areas.
Organizational measures
– Limitation of exposure time;
– Introduction of rest intervals;
– Selection of the most adequate time periods for the execution of the work;
– Automation of processes;
– Alteration of facilities or the deployment of jobs.
Material measures
– Control of emission sources;
– Replacement of work equipment;
– Protection of opaque walls and ceilings;
– Radiant heat protection screens;
– Protection of glazed surfaces.
Individual protection measures
– Use of personal protective equipment and appropriate clothing.
Medical surveillance measures
– Medical surveillance of workers exposed to aggressive thermal environments.

Conclusions
An unadjusted thermal environment can give rise to psychological discomfort and
malaise, absenteeism, reduced productivity, increased frequency of accidents and
physiological effects.
Most of the evaluated workplaces resulted in neutral thermal environment, existing
also several workplaces with cold thermal environment.
By the nature of the developed activity and due to food safety regulations and
requirements, air temperature cannot be increased.
This result highlight the importance of design measures, organizational and
material measures, alongside individual protection measures and suitable medical
surveillance.

Abstract. Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) issues has been a major chal‐
lenge to the Ghanaian government. The purpose of the study was to examine OHS
practices in Ghana. The study looked at various views from diﬀerent scholars
about OHS practices in order to achieve the objective of the study. Literature
review was conducted on OHS in Ghana. Findings from the study shows Ministry
of Roads and Transport (MRT) and Ministry of Water Resources, Works and
Housing (MWRWH) are two government ministries in charge of construction
and implementation of the construction sector policy. The Factories, Oﬃces and
Shops Act 1970, Act 328 and the Mining Regulations 1970 LI 665 are the two
major edicts. The study presents a strong background on OHS practices in Ghana
and contribute to the body of knowledge on the solution to the current trends and
challenges of OHS in the construction sector.

Introduction
The existence of several regulatory bodies in Ghana have compounded the Occupational
Health and Safety (OHS) challenges [1] and this is plagued with non-ratiﬁcation of the
of the ILO convention 1981 (No. 155). Mustapha, Aigbavboa and Thwala [2] opined
that OHS implementation and practice is a major challenge in the establishment of
comprehensive national OHS policy in Ghana. Mustapha et al. [3] in their study of
Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Challenges in the Ghanaian Construction
Industry recommended that OHS issues should be taken seriously at all levels to deal
with the challenges facing the construction sector. Moreover, Mustapha et al. [3] posited
that accident would only be reduced in the construction sector through eﬀective OHS
management and ratiﬁcation of International Labour Convention 1981 (No. 155). The
paper discussed institutional environment, OHS legislation, regulation setting, Interna‐
tional Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions Ratiﬁed by Ghana, ILO Convention 1981
(No. 155), current trends and challenges of OHS in Ghana.

Design/Methodology
The research method adopted is literature study from various studies on OHS in Ghana.
The review of literature looked into details on different views from different scholars
about Institutional Environment, Occupational Health and Safety Legislation, Regulation
Setting, International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions Ratified by Ghana, Current
Trends of Occupational Health and Safety and Occupation Health and Safety Challenges
in Ghana. Few studies out of several studies reviewed on OHS in Ghana were selected due
to their relevance. Specific issues relevant to OHS practices in Ghana were selected for
analysis from the results of the literature review. Needs for the study are clearly defined
and strategies are proposed for their improvement in the OHS practices.

Literature Review
This section under literature review provides information in relation to Institutional
Environment, Occupational Health and Safety Legislation, Regulation Setting, Inter‐
national Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions Ratiﬁed by Ghana, International
Labour Convention 1981 (No. 155), Current Trends of Occupational Health and Safety,
Occupation Health and Safety Challenges in Ghana.
3.1
Institutional Environment
The activities of many government ministries and other organisations aﬀect the
construction industry of Ghana. The activities of construction businesses and imple‐
mentation of state policy in the construction sector are under two government ministries:
Ministry of Roads and Transport (MRT) and Ministry of Water Resources, Works and
Housing (MWRWH). The Ministry of Roads and Transport (MRT) handles the road
sector of the economy. Ghana Highways Authority (GHA), Department of Urban Roads
(DUR) and Department of Feeder Roads (DFR) are under MRT. The Ministry of Water
Resources, Works and Housing (MWRWH) handles policy implementation in respect
of works, housing, water supply, sanitation and hydrology and oversees the activities of
building contractors. The MWRWH comprises of the Public Works Department (PWD),
the Department of Rural Housing, Department of Hydrology, Rent Control Department,
and agencies for implementing programmes deriving from government policies. Phys‐
ical developments, particularly roads and housing are carried out after the relevant
departments are satisﬁed that the project meets the requirements stipulated within the
planning and building regulations of Ghana. Environmental concerns have to be
addressed by the client and contractor [4].
The activities of other government ministries, departments and agencies that impact
on the construction industry as regulators:
i. Ministry of Manpower Development and Employment (MMDE) has the Labour
Department and Factory Inspectorate under it. Labour issues and issues relating to
employment is the responsibility of the former department while occupational
health and safety issues are the responsibility of the latter.
404
Z. Mustapha et al.

ii. Ministry of Environment and Science (MES) has the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and Town and Country Planning under it. The Environmental
Protection Agency implements policies relating to the environment and ensures
environmental regulations. The Town and Country Planning has the responsibility
for ensuring projects comply with zoning laws and building regulations.
iii. Ministry of Health, through its Occupational Health Unit, handles occupational
health issues.
iv. Ministry of Lands, Forestry and Mines has relatively many departments and agen‐
cies under it, responsible for the use of land and resources. The Lands Commission,
Survey Department, Oﬃce of the Administrator of Stool Lands, Lands Valuation
Board and Land Title Registry have roles that could inﬂuence the construction
industry [4].
3.2
Occupational Health and Safety Legislation
Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) legislation is a means by which the work envi‐
ronment can be controlled to ensure the safety, health and welfare of employees and
persons likely to be adversely aﬀected by the work environment. In Ghana, OHS legis‐
lation has been inherited from a British legal and institutional framework at the time
when Ghana was a British dependency. The H&S of workers in the mining and wood
processing industries of Ghana prior to independence was protected by the Factories
Ordinance 1952. This remained the main OHS legislation in force until its repeal by the
Factories, Oﬃces, and Shops Act 1970. Regulations made under the Factories Ordinance
1952 which remained enforced include:
i. The Factories (Woodworking) Regulations, 1959;
ii. The Food Factories (Welfare) Regulations, 1959; and
iii. The Factories (Docks Safety) Regulations, 1960 [5].
The Ghanaian OHS legislation is inﬂuenced by the International Labour Organisa‐
tion (ILO). Principal ILO conventions relating to OHS which have been ratiﬁed by
Ghana include:
i. Underground Work (Women) Convention 1935 (No. 45);
ii. Radiation Protection Convention 1960 (No. 115);
iii. Guarding of Machinery Convention 1963 (No. 119);
iv. Hygiene (Commerce and Oﬃces) Convention 1964;
v. Working Environment (Air Pollution, Noise and Vibration) Convention, 1977;
vi. Labour Inspection Convention 1947 [5].
Existing OHS legislation in Ghana is fragmented and limited in coverage. Some key
economic sectors are not covered by the country’s OHS laws. A notable example is the
agricultural sector, although it employs over 60% of the country’s workforce. There is
no form of OHS laws regulating the activities of the construction sector. This unfortunate
situation can be traced back to colonial rule in Gold Coast (Ghana), where the colonial
government placed more emphasis on labour relations in sectors of the economy where
Examination of Occupational Health and Safety Practices in Ghana
405

formal employment relations existed. The mining and manufacturing sectors of the
economy are examples of such economic sectors [5].
3.3
Regulation Setting
The Labour Act No 651 of 2003 consolidates and updates the various pieces of former
legislation, and introduces provisions to reﬂect ratiﬁed ILO Conventions. The Labour
Act covers all employers and employees except those in strategic positions such as the
Armed Forces, Police Service, Prisons Service and the Security Intelligence Agencies.
Major provisions of the Labour Act include establishment of public and private employ‐
ment centres, protection of the employment relationship, general conditions of employ‐
ment, employment of persons with disabilities, employment of young persons, employ‐
ment of women, fair and unfair termination of employment, protection of remuneration,
temporary and casual employees, unions, employers’ organisations and collective agree‐
ments, strikes, establishment of a National Tripartite Committee, forced labour, occu‐
pational health and safety, labour inspection and the establishment of the National
Labour Commission [6]. Employers are therefore obliged to provide training for their
employees for the attainment of the level of competence required for the performance
of their jobs and to enhance their career [6].
3.4
International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions Ratiﬁed by Ghana
Ghana joined the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in 1957 and immediately the
Convention Peoples Party (CPP) Government ratiﬁed many of the ILO Conventions
including the ‘core’ Conventions that guarantee workers the right and freedom to form
or join unions (Convention No. 87), the right to collective bargaining (Convention No.
98), abolition of forced labour (Conventions Nos. 29 and 105), and equal treatment
(Conventions Nos. 100 and 111). Many other ILO Conventions that sought to promote
industrial harmony and welfare of workers were also ratiﬁed. These included Conven‐
tions on hours of work in industry, weekly rest, minimum wage ﬁxing, labour inspection,
underground work by women, employment service, night work by women, social policy,
working environment, child labour, labour administration, and many others. Ghana has
so far ratiﬁed 46 ILO Conventions [6].
3.5
International Labour Convention 1981 (No. 155)
The ILO convention, 1981 (No. 115) is important due to some fundamental ideas and
ways of carrying out activities put in place for OHS management improvement. It intro‐
duces interrelated activities of a national policy to OHS. The national OSH policy gives
a framework to reduce hazards at workplace and this should be formulated, implemented
and reviewed yearly. Article 7 of the Convention indicates that the formulation, imple‐
mentation and yearly review of the national OSH policy should be done through iden‐
tiﬁcation of major problems and provide methods that are eﬀective. Since the aim of the
policy and under Article 4.2 of Convention No. 155 is prevention of accident and injury
406
Z. Mustapha et al.

at workplace. Hence, the national OSH policy should enforce the ILO convention, 1981
(No. 115) towards OHS improvement [7].
3.6
Occupational Health and Safety Trend in Ghana
Currently, there two major edicts that provide guidance for occupational or industrial
safety and health services, practice and management in Ghana [1, 8]. These include the
Factories, Oﬃces and Shops Act 1970, Act 328 and the Mining Regulations 1970 LI
665. The presence of Workmen’s Compensation Law 1987 (PNDC 187) has direct
impacts on monitoring worker or workplace safety. Statutes that indirectly impact on
OHS include Environmental Protection Agency Act 490 1994, the Ghana Health Service
and Teaching Hospital Act 526, 1999 and the National Road Safety Commission Act
567 1999 [8].
Ghana is among the 183 member countries of ILO, which requires, as per the ILO
convention number 155 1981, that member countries formulate, implement and peri‐
odically review a coherent policy on OHS and work environment. Ghana is yet to rectify
this convention and has not established authority dedicated to OHS to guide and facilitate
the implementation of the “Action at the National Level” as indicated in the R164OHS
recommendation, 1981 [1, 8]. However, the Labour Act 2003, Act 651, Part XV,
sections 118 to 120 apparently directs employers and employees in their roles and
responsibilities in managing OHS and Environment in the nation. However, it is not
clear what to consider as Occupational Illness and who handles the implementation of
corrective actions as per recommendations. Currently, accidents that occur in factories
are expected to be reported to the Department of Factory Inspectorate (DFI), but compa‐
nies hardly report such events to the inspectorate for investigation and correction. Hence,
there is a little or no positive eﬀect of the action of the DFI on the factories [8].
3.7
Challenges of Occupation Health and Safety in Ghana
The Ghanaian Government has been facing challenges in the Occupational Health and
Safety (OHS), plagued with its inability to ratify the International Labour Organisation
(ILO) convention, 1981 (No. 155). This development has aﬀected the construction
industry as indicated by [1]. Kheni et al. [4] asserted that inadequate government support
for regulatory institutions and lack of skilled human resources were among the chal‐
lenges of OHS in Ghana. Dadzie [9] posited H&S training deﬁciency, inability to assess
danger and workers reluctant attitudes towards H&S. Human resources development
and inadequate OHS capacity for the industry has been indicated as some of the chal‐
lenges [10]. Even though, the concept of OHS in industries was conceived in Ghana
before the introduction two major edicts [1] The existence of some fragments of OHS
legal requirements under jurisdictions of diﬀerent agencies in Ghana has led to the OHS
challenges in Ghana [1].

Lessons Learnt
The following are the lessons learnt from the study of the Examination of Occupational
Health and Safety Practices in Ghana. The activities of construction businesses and
implementation of state policy in the construction sector are under two government
ministries: Ministry of Roads and Transport (MRT) and Ministry of Water Resources,
Works and Housing (MWRWH) are two government ministries which supervises
construction and implementation of the state policy in the construction sector. Two
major edicts that provide guidance in the provision of occupational or industrial safety
and health services, practice and management in Ghana are The Factories, Oﬃces and
Shops Act 1970, Act 328 and the Mining Regulations 1970 LI 665. This OHS legislation
are protected by the Factories Ordinance 1952. These include the Factories (Wood‐
working) Regulations, 195 9, the Food Factories (Welfare) Regulations, 1959; and the
Factories (Docks Safety) Regulations, 1960. The Labour Act No 651 of 2003 consoli‐
dates and updates the various pieces of former legislation and introduces provisions to
reﬂect ratiﬁed ILO Conventions. The Labour Act covers all employers and employees
except those in strategic positions such as the Armed Forces, Police Service, Prisons
Service and the Security Intelligence Agencies. The construction sector lacks OHS
regulations. Hence, the adoption of the ILO convention 1981 (No. 115) as the OHS
policy in Ghana should be encouraged.

Conclusion
The purpose of the study was to examine Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Prac‐
tices in Ghana. The non-compliance with H&S rules and regulations in the Ghanaian
construction sector is as a result of non-ratiﬁcation of the ILO convention 1981 (No.
115). This has resulted to the major issues facing the construction sector, in addition to
occurrences of injuries and accidents. This development is a major blow to most of the
institutions in Ghana because there is no standard degree meant for OHS for the
construction sector Therefore, the call for proper development of H&S policy for the
construction sector in Ghana.

Abstract. The prevalence and use of portable electronic devices have contrib‐
uted to the sedentary lifestyle of children. When used, these devices often cause
children to remain in astatic posture for minutes and even hours within a day. This
study investigated the possible eﬀects of smart phone use on the musculoskeletal
system of children. The focus was on children 10 to 12 years of age. Nine partic‐
ipants and parents completed a questionnaire. A goniometer was used to measure
neck ﬂexion and a measuring tape was used to measure viewing distance. While
all participants reported feelings of discomfort after using a cell phone, all parents
reported their child never complained of any discomfort. Seven of eight children
identiﬁed feelings of pain in one or more body regions. Neck ﬂexion ranged from
3° to 56°. Findings raise concern about the increased risks of children developing
cumulative trauma disorders.

Introduction
In 2013, 2.32 billion devices (personal computers (PCs), tablets, and cell phones) were
projected to be sold worldwide [1]. Sales were expected to increase to approximately
2.49 billion devices in 2014. While PC sales were expected to decline, the sale of tablets
and cell phones were expected to continue to rise. Of the more than 2.32 billion devices
sold in 2013, cell phones accounted for approximately 1.8 billion (78%) [1]. The cell
phone has become the device that many take with them not just when traveling, but also
to dinner table, restrooms, and even to bed [2]. Most of these portable devices are sold
to adults for their own use or for their children. Whether the intended user is an adult or
a child, children, as young as three, make up a high percentage of users of cell phones
and tablets [3–5]. However, one does not have to look too far to see that toddlers, even
babies as young as nine or ten months old are using the devices. In fact, children are
consistent, daily users of these devices for long periods of time as they are lightweight,
portable, and contain simple interfaces.
The increased use of cell phones and other electronic devices has led to a growing
concern, by researchers and others, about the impact of these devices on the health of
children. The high use of cell phones by children, 10 mo. or younger to age 17, has led

to a call for precaution. There is a community of researchers who believe there is a causal
relationship of cell phone use to cancer; primarily in the form of brain tumors resulting
from exposure to and absorption of microwave radiation in children [6–9]. There has
been no convincing evidence of this link [10, 11].
The proliferation of portable electronics has contributed to the sedentary lifestyle of
adults and children. When used, these devices cause the user to remain in static postures
for minutes and hours within a day, with eyes ﬁxed to a screen. This has led to the study
of computer visual symptoms (CVS) with smart phone use. Viewing the small screens
of smart phones necessitates close working distances which may induce various symp‐
toms such as dry eyes, fatigue, headaches, eyestrain (asthenopia), presbyopia, etc. [12–
15]. Berolo et al. [16] and Kim [17] studied the musculoskeletal symptoms and neck
posture of users of mobile hand-held devices and smart phones, respectively. Each found
that a neutral neck posture was altered. The static postures of smart phone users is not
unlike those seen by users of computer display monitors or even in professions such as
dentistry where a load is placed on the neck and back [18–20]. Per the international
standard, ISO 11226 [21] which evaluates the static working postures, neck ﬂexion of
0°–25° is acceptable as long as there is variation in the task. However, the use of smart
phones lends itself to little to no variation in tasks.
Much of what is known to date on the impact of smart phones is based on studies of
adults. Little is known about the eﬀect of the use of electronic devices on the muscu‐
loskeletal system of children. This research focuses on the impact of smart phone use
and possible relationships to increased risks of the development of cumulative trauma
disorders in children. Neck ﬂexion and viewing distance are measured.

Method
2.1
Participants
Nine participants were recruited from the Peoria, Illinois metropolitan area; ﬁve females
and four males. Two of the participants participated in the observational study. The
children ranged in age from ages 10–12, with a mean age and standard deviation of 11.67
(±1) years. Mean height and standard deviation were 58.5 (±3.64) in, with a mean (SD)
weight of 95.73 (22.78) lb. The mean grade of the participants was 6.33 (±1.41). Eight
of nine participants were right handed and three of the nine had corrected vision. All
participants were in good to excellent health and none were currently under or previously
under a doctor’s care for a musculoskeletal disorder in the last 12 months. Both partic‐
ipants and their parent or guardian provided written consent to participate in the study.
Upon completion of the study, each participant was given $20 for compensation. The
study was approved by the university’s Committee on the Use of Human Subjects in
Research.
2.2
Experimental Design
The experiment involved the independent variables device (smart phone) and position
(seated on sofa (SS), seated in a chair (SC) at a desk, and seated on the floor (SF) on a
414
R. Pope-Ford

rug). An additional position was called personal choice. For personal choice, the partici‐
pant could select any of the three seated positions. There were two dependent variables –
viewing distance and neck flexion. Personal choice was always performed first. The other
three trials were run in random order. This study is part of a larger study which involves
an additional device and additional trials. Descriptive statistics were performed.
2.3
Equipment
For this study, a plastic 12 in, 360° ISOM (international standard of measurement)
goniometer with a scale of 1° increments was used to measure neck ﬂexion. A
60 in./150 cm soft cloth measuring tape was used to measure the viewing distance.
Viewing distance was measured as the distance from the eye to the smart phone screen.
All participants were given a Nexus 5× 16 GB smart phone loaded with age appropriate
games (such as Angry Birds, Subway Surfer, Jet Pack, Crossy Road, etc.) to play during
each trial. Two questionnaires were developed by the researcher using the ©2017
Qualtrics LLC survey tool – one for the parent and another for the participant. Two Sony
Handycam CX440 camcorders were used to record each session.
2.4
Procedure
Prior to the start of the experiment, both the parent and the participant signed the consent
form and were given their respective questionnaires. With the exception of one parent
and two children who completed paper copies, the questionnaire was completed on line
using the Qualtrics software. A link to the parent questionnaire was sent to the parent’s
email address. Demographic data was collected from the participant and the trials were
conducted in randomized order, excepting the personal choice trial. Each child had the
option to choose from the preloaded games on the device and play a game(s) of his/her
choice. Each trial lasted two minutes, with a recovery period of one minute between
each trial. Measurements were taken at approximately the one minute mark.

Questionnaire Results – Daily Use and Musculoskeletal Symptoms
All nine participants reported some daily use of the smart phone. Parents reported
applying time restrictions to the use of the smart phones and indicated the use of the
device to be less than one hour per day. Seven of the participants reported using the
smart phone for two or more hours per day, with one reporting more than four hours per
day. See Table 1 for the estimated daily use. It is important to note that additional hours
each week can be or were spent, as reported, playing or interacting with other electronic
devices (such as a Wii, Xbox, PlayStation, iPod, tablet, or the computer).

When asked if their child ever complained of any body areas of discomfort or pain
after use of the phone, all parents responded that their child never complained of
discomfort or pain related to cell phone use. However, when shown the body diagram
in Fig. 1, seven of eight participants indicated they felt discomfort or pain in certain
body regions related to smart phone use. Data was not available for one participant.
Discomfort/pain was most prevalent in the neck (See Fig. 2) with six of eight (75%)
identifying discomfort/pain in this body region. In both the upper back and the wrist/
hand/ﬁngers areas, three (37.5%) people reported discomfort/pain. Two people also
reported headaches related to the use of their smart phones. A mean (SD) of 2.25 (±1.58)
musculoskeletal symptoms were reported. In all cases, except one, the reported pain was
moderate. For the one exception, the participant described the neck pain as severe. No
one identiﬁed any musculoskeletal symptoms in the lower extremities.

Neck Flexion and Viewing Distance
As the participants performed the four trials, neck ﬂexion and viewing distance were
measured for each of the trials. When given a choice to select a seated position, ﬁve
participants chose the sofa, three chose to sit on the ﬂoor (on a rug), and one chose to
sit in the chair at the desk. The mean (±SD) and range for each of the positions is shown
in Table 2 for viewing distance and neck ﬂexion.

The mean viewing distance varied by a maximum of 1.4 in for the four trials and
ranged from nine to 21 in. The shortest range was seen when participants were seated
in the chair. In this position, the forearms often rested on the desk. (Note: In two
instances, viewing distance and neck ﬂexion data were not available for Participants 1
and 2.)

The range of neck ﬂexion for the nine participants was from a minimum of 3° to a
maximum of 56°. The lowest range of neck ﬂexion was seen when participants were
seated in the chair. Lower degrees of neck ﬂexion were seen when participants were
seated in the chair with the back and head supported by the backrest of the chair. Minimal
diﬀerences were seen between the mean (±SD) of the diﬀerent positions. In Fig. 3 the
viewing distances and neck ﬂexions, for each participant, are shown for the seated in
chair position. A participant with a neck ﬂexion of 8° and another with neck ﬂexion of
43° each had the same viewing distance of 16 in. The same type of relationship held true

Discussion
It was determined, via self-reporting, that parents and children, on two separate occa‐
sions, held contrasting views. While parents reported placing some restrictions on the
use of phones each day, the parents’ estimation of the number of hours of use of the
device was in most cases less than those reported by the child. The parental reports of
less than one hour per day of smart phone use, was in agreement with only two of the
nine children. Seven of the nine children in this study reported spending at least two or
more hours per day using their cell phones. Another area where parents diﬀered from
their child was the reporting of musculoskeletal symptoms. Per each parent, the child
never complained of any discomfort or pain related to the use of the smart phone. This
led parents to believe no pain or discomfort associated with cell phone use. Yet, in
response to this same question, all but one child readily identiﬁed one or more regions
of pain. The highest reports were of four and ﬁve areas of pain with the mean of 2.25
(±1.58) per person. This contrast in responses reveals a gap in what children report about
their health and what parents perceive as potential problems due to a lack of reporting
by their child.
While using these devices, the user remains in a static posture with the neck ﬂexed.
Regardless of the position while using the smart phone, the range of viewing distance
and range of neck ﬂexion varied minimally. Per ISO 11226 [21], as long as there is
variation in the task, neck ﬂexion of 0°–25° is acceptable. Therefore, it would appear at
ﬁrst glance that for the participants for whom the neck ﬂexion data was available, only
three participants would be considered at risk for developing a musculoskeletal disorder;

as their neck ﬂexions exceeded 25°. For one participant, neck ﬂexion exceeded the
acceptable limit by at least 15° for all four trials. For another, acceptable limits were at
least 10° above the acceptable limit for each trial, and for the third person, the limit was
exceeded by 10° for three of four trials. Though the other participants were within the
acceptable limit for neck ﬂexion, duration, frequency, and lack of variation in tasks, puts
these participants at risk of developing a musculoskeletal disorder.
Participants in this study reported using smart phones for uses other than phone calls.
These devices were used to view social media, Instagram, for texting, for playing games
as in this study, as well as other uses. When compared to Bilton’s [23] proposal of
adopting a viewing distance of one foot (30 cm), ﬁve out of nine (55.5%) of the partic‐
ipants were consistent in doing so. However, 14.7% of the time or in ﬁve instances, two
by the same individual, the one foot viewing distance was violated. In these cases, the
phone was held as close as nine inches from the user. These occurrences of close,
prolonged viewing could contribute to increased instances of dry eyes in children,
asthenopia, and/or lead to the acceleration of presbyopia which is usually seen in people
40 and over.
Early ﬁndings from this limited study of this young population provide preliminary
evidence of an increased risk of developing a cumulative trauma disorders at a young
age. Parents and other caretakers will likely need to observe, note and ask the child about
possible areas of pain or discomfort during and after smart phone use. The researcher
does realize that too many questions could make some children less truthful, if they
sense enjoyed privileges could be reduced. It is likely that children 10–12 years of age,
and even older, do not understand the repercussions of the symptoms reported. At the
very least, children should be encouraged to also participate in activities that do not
require a static posture. Children should also be encouraged while using smart phones
to periodically pause and refrain from looking at the device and to engage in some
stretches or exercises for the neck, shoulders, back and hands.
5
Conclusion
This study identiﬁes the potential of increased risks of developing cumulative trauma
disorders, due to daily, prolonged, smart phone use. A gap in reporting of musculoske‐
letal symptoms by children, an inability to identify or perceive postural issues by parents,
prolonged neck ﬂexion, and the close viewing distances can all lead to increased risks
and the earlier onset of cumulative trauma disorders of the musculoskeletal and ocular
system of children. Though this study focused on 10 to 12 year olds, smart phones are
not just used by children starting at the ages 10-12, but these phones are used by children
much younger, including toddlers and babies, for prolonged periods of time. Though
this study is limited by a small sample size, its ﬁndings encourage continuation of the
study to further validate the current results. Until further studies can conﬁrm these
ﬁndings, parents and other caretakers of children should take some precautions. All
should be vigilant in watching for musculoskeletal and ocular symptoms in children and
encourage activity that does not involve static posture.

Abstract. This paper presents a posture assessment tool which utilizes the depth
sensing techniques of a 3D imaging sensor for ergonomic risk assessment of
seated worker’s postures during controlled manual handling tasks. The tool,
which has been developed to utilize the manual handling guidelines by the Health
and Safety Regulators of some selected countries to measure and assess the
postures of the upper bodies of Operators, is tested to ascertain its eﬀectiveness
in assessing seated postures. The tool oﬀers real-time posture assessment with
real-time feedback to inform Operators on when to adjust awkward seated
postures. An experiment has been performed to record, assess and display the
work postures of some seated Operators in real-time with ‘Good’ and ‘Awkward’
postures identiﬁed with real-time feedback provided to the Operators. Results
show that the tool can assess seated work postures in real-time which helps to
reduce the rate of occurrence of Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders.

Introduction
Manual handling tasks involving reaching, lifting, and assembly tasks sometimes require
workers to sit throughout the day. Prolonged sitting as well as poor seated postures has
been found to be among the leading causes of low back pain and consequently, Work-
Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs) [1–4]. The sitting posture has been iden‐
tiﬁed as the worst body posture that exists because it forces the spine to adopt a non-
natural posture which negatively aﬀects it [5]. This is further explained by the fact that
as the hips turn, greater pressure is applied on the spine when the trunk is bent forward,
thereby leading to backaches and injuries [6].
Hence, maintaining good seated posture while working do not only improve eﬃ‐
ciency, but also protects the worker’s health [7]. Again, providing highly adjustable
furniture along with adequate training of the users is a key requirement for ergonomic
interventions of seated workers [4, 8]. Various international standards such as the ISO
5970:1979, have established recommended chair and table sizes with respect to the

height of the user [9] and chairs with high backrests can reduce the likelihood of low
back pains [3, 6]. The ANSI/HFES 100-2007 standard by the Human Factors and Ergo‐
nomics Society recommends adjustable seat pan angles 0°–4°, seat pan backrest of not
less than 90° and seat pan recline not exceeding 25° from the vertical [10]. Good seating
involves ﬁtting the chair and desks within the body limits of the user and seats should
vary depending on task demands [11].
This paper therefore focuses on the use of a developed Health and Safety (H&S)
compliance posture assessment tool which utilizes a 3D imaging sensor for the real time
measurement, analysis and risk assessment of the work postures of seated workers
during manual handling activities.

Review of Methods for Posture Measurements of Human Body
Work postures, if awkward, can lead to WMSDs among workers on the shop floor [12, 13].
Measuring posture movements has been found to be very important for determining the risk
of WMSDs in the workplace [14] and the methods for assessing these risks depends on the
accuracy and precision of the data collection techniques employed [15]. For posture meas‐
urements, the reference point is described by the H&S Regulators as the neutral position
which occurs when all the joints of the body are naturally aligned, with the trunk and head
upright, arms by the side and forearms hanging straight or at a right angle to the upper arm,
while the hand is in the handshake position [16–18]. Any deviation from the neutral posi‐
tion beyond the recommended limit often results in awkward postures. This posture can be
detrimental to the health when held for prolonged period, hence, the need for a real-time
assessment and feedback using appropriate tools with real-time capabilities, so as to inform
the operators to adjust any awkward postures they adopt while working.
Research has revealed the existence of several tools developed for measurement of
seated work postures. The Computer-assisted recording and long-term analysis of
musculoskeletal load (CUELA system), a posture measurement tool developed by the
German IFA [19], has been used to measure the body postures of seated Vehicle oper‐
ators [2]. The system however, does not conduct risk assessment of these postures. Other
tools available for measuring human postures include the Ovako Working Posture
Assessment. System [20], the force plate [21, 22], photography [15, 22], tape, sensors
[23], Microsoft Kinect etc. Photographs and videos often produces inaccurate measure‐
ment of joint angles as a result of distortions caused by camera placement issues [15].
Video camera alone cannot be used for posture data measurement, rather, the data
obtained needs to be further analyzed using appropriate postural assessment tool [24].
A 3D marker-based measurement system and electromagnetic tracking system can
be used to measure the relative angles of the upper bodies of seated workers [23, 25].
This tool can aid posture data collection and analysis in ﬁner details [21]. Inclinometers
based on triaxial accelerometers can be used to measure the ﬂexion, extension and lateral
extension angles of the human head and upper arms [26]. A photogrammetric analysis
method can aid posture data measurements by measuring the joint angles of the upper
extremities of the human body [27]. Models of cards has been used for recording seated

dynamic work postures [20]. However, the afore-mentioned tools are either marker-
based and as a result are required to be worn by the operator, or they lack the real-time
feedback capabilities which can help to ergonomically improve worker’s postures.
Microsoft Kinect has been recommended as an alternative method for posture measure‐
ment because of its cost-effectiveness, 3D motion capture and awkward posture classifica‐
tion capabilities [14, 15, 22, 28]. The sensor can measure human joint angles and can
compute joint angles for possible posture evaluations and analysis [15, 21, 29, 30]. It has
been proved to be a suitable tool for fast and reliable estimation of human morphology [31].
This paper focuses on the use of a Kinect-sensor-based, non-invasive posture assess‐
ment tool, developed by the authors, to measure as well as conduct ergonomic assess‐
ment of seated work postures of Operators with real-time display, in compliance with
the H&S Guidelines of diﬀerent countries.

The seating recommended guidelines by the UK HSE for safe manual handling activities
include:
• Avoid awkward stretching and twisting by placing objects within the recommended
reach distance of −0.6 m to +0.6 m along the horizontal plane.
• Ensure the workplace is well lighted to avoid adoption of awkward postures by the
workers.
• Adjust the seat to enable you sit comfortably depending on the task.
• Avoid sitting to lift because it strains the back. If not, keep the object to be lifted
close to the body.
• Work surface thickness of about 0.03 m should not be exceeded.
• Avoid bending and twisting while sitting to handle rather place the load/materials at
waist height on a rack.
• Avoid sitting to handle heavy loads.
• Weight of load to be handled while seated should not exceed 3 kg for women and
5 kg for men.
The following seat dimensions should be ensured;
• Adjustable seat height of 0.38 m to 0.56 m.

Methodology
In this section, we discuss how the developed H&S compliance posture assessment tool
was utilized to assess the postures of the upper bodies of seated Operators. A total of
ten (10) seated Operators were tested while carrying out diﬀerent manual handling
activities. There were 7 males and 3 females whose age range from 25 to 35 years. None
of the participants was unhealthy or had a case of back pain or injuries at the time of the
experiment.
3.1
Overview of the Developed Posture Assessment Tool
The developed tool consists of Microsoft Kinect sensor and a developed software appli‐
cation which enables the sensor to capture, analyze and assess the postures of workers
during any manual handling operation. It is capable of carrying out ergonomic assess‐
ment in real-time and in compliance to the H&S guidelines.
The assessment tool was developed through appropriate codes written in C#
Programming Language and which uses the APIs provided by the Kinect for Windows
SDK and the WPF Application of the .NET Framework 4.5 in Visual Studio [39]. The
algorithm enables the Microsoft Kinect to record the joint angles of seated Operators
and display same in real-time.
The ﬁrst step in the development of the tool was the computation of the vectors for
each joint which triggered the joint angle measurement, using Eq. (1). The reference
point which is the neutral position was then established such that any deviation from the
neutral position results in awkward postures according to the recommendations of the
H&S professionals.

Procedure for Testing the Developed Tool
Participants were asked to handle a 1 kg load under diﬀerent ergonomic conditions while
seated. These include far and normal reaching, bending to lift, bending and twisting,
turning etc. Before starting the experiment, the participants were ﬁrst familiarized with
the manual handling regulations on safe handling techniques so as to avoid the risk of
sudden injuries.
During the experiment, the neutral position of each participant was tracked using the
sensor after which the rate of deviation of each joint from the neutral position is assessed
with the result displayed in real-time to the participants. The chair used for the experi‐
ment was carefully selected to meet the H&S recommended standards for chairs, as
described in Sect. 1.

Results
4.1
Tracking the Neutral Position
H&S Professionals have established that awkward posture occurs when a part of the
body deviates from its neutral position or its natural alignment and a neutral position is
428
C.E. Mgbemena et al.

when the joints are naturally aligned with the trunk and head upright, the arms by the
side, and forearms hanging straight or at a right angle to the upper arm, while the hand
is in the handshake position with the wrists not bent or deviated and the buttocks and
back are supported [16–18, 33, 40, 41].
Figure 2 shows the result obtained from tracking the neutral position of a seated
participant. Notice that all the joints are speciﬁed as “Good” and displaced to a worker
in real-time.

Tracking Deviations from the Neutral Position
In order to assess the tool further, deviations from the neutral position were simulated
as shown in Fig. 3. The results show that the tool is capable of detecting awkward
positions and can provide a real-time display of the assessed posture towards enabling
a worker to adjust possible awkward postures.

Discussion
The study is limited to posture assessment of the upper body of seated Operators. Having
studied the manual handling guidelines as recommended by various H&S professionals,
the relevant deﬁnitions are used to develop a posture assessment tool using 3D imaging
sensors. The ﬁrst step in the experiment was to ensure that the chair provided meets the
standards as speciﬁed by the H&S professionals and highlighted in Sect. 1.2. Next, the
neutral posture of each participant was tracked as in Fig. 2. Finally, the deviations from
the neutral position of each of the joints are assessed by the tool and displayed to the
participants in real-time.
In Fig. 3a in which the Operator is bending to lift while seated, the left elbow, right
and left wrists, and right hips (SpineB RTR), are displayed as ‘Good’. This means that
the speciﬁed joints have not exceeded the recommended limits as at the time of the
capture. Every other joint, including the back posture (SpineBase), are displayed as
‘Awkward’. This is in agreement with the UK HSE regulation that operators should
avoid sitting to lift as it strains the back.
Figure 3b shows an Operator sitting to pick. The location of the items on the work
table forced her to extend her left arm. Therefore, even though she did not ﬂex/bend her
back and neck beyond its neutral position (SpineBase and Neck = ‘Good’), her elbows,
wrists and left shoulder were stretched further away from their neutral positions resulting
in ‘Awkward’ posture display for these joints. This real-time display can enable the
Operator to adjust awkward postures so to minimize the likelihood of WMSDs.

Conclusion
This paper presents an ergonomic posture assessment tool which utilizes the depth
sensing techniques of a 3D imaging sensor to conduct an ergonomic risk assessment of
seated worker’s postures during controlled manual handling tasks. The tool consists of
the Microsoft Kinect sensor and its data-retrieval software application on which the H&S
recommendations for manual handling activities were incorporated.
When tested on some selected seated Operators, the tool was found to measure and
assess the postures of the upper bodies of the Operators with real-time feedback to the
seated workers to alert them on when to adjust awkward postures which may be detri‐
mental to their health when held for prolonged period.
Finally, the developed tool is beneﬁcial to every workplace that seek to improve
worker’s productivity and plant eﬃciency as it can help to reduce the rate of occurrence
of awkward postures among its seated workforce.

Abstract. In the future workplaces, the new technology devices will be present
at all times, so new spaces will need a new approach to lighting design, and in
order to achieve this it will be necessary that the lighting systems, and the
workplaces get smarter. New technology turns the present-day workplaces less
efﬁcient. In lighting, there are new luminaires that help us to manage our
physiological and psychological needs. Besides, there is also smart glasses
which are a very recent innovation that can help us to take advantage from the
positive form of the sun, the promotion of vitamin D production. To achieve
such goals the research will be conducted throughout literature review. We
expect to conclude that LED is the most efﬁcient lighting system but we suspect
that it is not any kind of LED system that will respond, and manage, our
circadian, as well as, our visual needs.

Introduction
With so many evolutions in so many knowledge ﬁelds, as well as in technological
systems we need to adjust to them at a rate that may not be very positive. In order to
cross the information of some of the main technologies that can help us to cope with
this transition into the future we will begin to explain how can we improve and
maintain our health and wellbeing at workplaces. Visual and Nonvisual systems are
inﬂuenced by external cues, and we will discuss some of them. Afterwards, we will
start with the new achievements in lighting systems, the recent technologies and how
they can help us to improve health and wellbeing. LEDs are the lighting system that
can avoid mercury presence in ﬂuorescent light system, can promote our nonvisual
systems through the blue light and are more efﬁcient. We will draw our attention to
differences between its ancestors on lighting systems (incandescent, halogen and
ﬂuorescent) but our focus will be LEDs. Then, we will talk about technologic evolution
that is being held at workplaces. Lastly, we will state the recent approaches to glass,
speciﬁcally the smart glass devices.

Literature Review
2.1
Visual and Nonvisual Systems
The visual system depends greatly on light in order to enables us to see but so does the
nonvisual system. Daylight enables us through the eyes (visual) to reset and syn-
chronize our circadian rhythms (nonvisual). Visually speaking, the human eye is more
sensitive to green light (550 nm) and this sensitivity decreases towards the red and blue
ends of the spectrum [2]. In addition, it is on the blue end of the spectrum that the
production of melatonin is stopped, whereas the red end promotes its production. So,
the colour of light is not irrelevant for our nonvisual functions. Nonvisual, through the
circadian rhythms, regulates important physiological and behavioural rhythms, such as
sleep-wake cycles, alertness and performance patterns, psychomotor vigilance, cog-
nitive brain functions, attention, memory, CBT (core body temperature), heart rate, and
hormone production. Besides melatonin (darkness hormone), serotonin (mood hor-
mone) and cortisol (stress hormone) also depends of light. However, serotonin and
cortisol are inﬂuenced by the intensity of light, when the light is brighter (blue light)
these hormones are produced. The downside is how to achieve the equilibrium, if we
stay under bright light exposure too much time cortisol, for instance, will give place to
adrenalin and noradrenalin production which are not so good for stress levels, since it
exposure can lead to heart problems in the future. Without light, we will not only stop
being able to see, but also our mood will decrease greatly, SAD (seasonal affective
disorder) is a result of insufﬁcient levels of light exposure, which occurs mainly in the
winter months due to sunlight weakness. When we believed that light only helped us to
see it was easier to conceive indoor places, such as workplaces. But, at the present time,
we know that nonvisual functions also depend on the brightness and wavelength of
ambient light [1, 2].
So, the visual functions are driven by two types of visual photoreceptors in the
retina, cones and rods. Rods (scotopic) have a peak of sensitivity at 505 nm, while the
cone’s peak sensitivity (photopic) happens at 555 nm (Fig. 1). On the other hand,
nonvisual functions are mediated through a photoreceptor that contains the photopig-
ment melanopsin, the ipRGCs (intrinsically photopigment retinal ganglion cell).
IpRGCs are circa 2% of the retina, situated outside the fovea. Melanopsin is more
sensitive to short-wavelength light at 480 nm (blue light). The sensibility of ipRGCs
varies in the intensity, duration/pattern, and timing of light exposure when compared to
vision. Surprisingly, there is a cooperation between the photoreceptors and ipRGCs, for
example, cones, combined with ipRGCs, contribute to non-visual responses at the
beginning of a light exposure and at low irradiance, although they are slower and lazier
than cones and rods [3]. Even though, at long exposures to high irradiances is the
ipRGCs that take over. In the course to continuous light exposure, ipRGCs the con-
tribution [4]. Another fact is that, due to its sluggish, ipRGCs do not respond to
individual intermittent light exposures of low irradiance [4].
To sum up, we can say that it is the short-wavelength portion of the spectrum (446–
477 nm), the blue light, that results into melatonin suppression from the pineal gland
and, at the same time, enhances alertness, increases heart rate and body temperature
and induces expression of the circadian click gene Per2 in humans, whereas
436

long-wavelength exposure is three times less powerful. We are giving special attention
to blue light side effects, positive and negative, just because the ultimate light tech-
nology works under its spectrum, such as the case of LEDs. We, also, stated that
intensity of light, spectrum, timing, duration and spatial distribution are light factors
that have to be considered in order to allow us to achieve a balance between the visual
and nonvisual systems [6].
2.2
LEDs
Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs) are entering through our workplaces, and homes mostly
due to economic reasons, since they are more durable, compact, and versatile and only
consume one-tenth of the power that is used to consume by incandescent lighting. On
the other hand, extensive biomedical research showed that LED can have inﬂuence on
our biological and behavioural systems. Furthermore, LEDs can be controlled for
changes on the light ﬁve characteristics (intensity, spectrum, timing, duration, and
distribution) and thus be a help to our circadian, neuroendocrine and neurobehavioral
physiology, at least it is already used for doing so with astronauts. In opposition,
short-wavelength light (blue light) can be helpful for disrupted sleep, circadian rhythms
synchronization or diminished alertness due to the fact that blue light increase mela-
tonin suppression [6].
Another important fact, is that we are more familiarized with incandescent and
ﬂuorescent artiﬁcial lighting systems. But, the truth is that the ﬁrst one was already
discontinued and the second is the next one. Therefore, we will discuss the new lighting
system that, if we give the right attention to it, we will perceive that these kind of
technology are different. The old lighting systems (incandescent, halogen, and
ﬂuorescent) and the new ones (LED) are based on different technologies, the ﬁrst ones
are electrical and LEDs are electronic. So, if we think about the measurements, they are
not the same. Until now, when we think of a lamp we think of watts, but now, when we
want to buy a lamp there is another unit, the lumen. As a result, we think lamps for their
wattage output, and then we tend to do the same with LEDs. However, a standard
60-watt incandescent lamp emits 800 lumens, but the light is emitted equally in all
directions. Then again, lumen is a standard unit that measures the perceived power of a
Fig. 1. Cones, rods and ipRGCs sensitivities [5].
Smart Workplaces, Smart Lighting and Smart Glass

light source. Lumen is not the best way of measuring a LED light source but delivered
light (illuminance) is. Illuminance is the intensity of light falling on a surface area and
if it is measured in square feet, the unit is foot-candles (fc), and if it is measured in
square meters, the unit is lux (lx). For example, 50 fc are equal to 500 lx [7]. LEDs are
directional and create light without ﬁltering or additional lensing and shading. The
result is that other lighting systems, such as ﬂuorescent, waste more light which can be
partially blocked or dispersed, as well as emitted towards other direction than the one
that is supposed to, or simply the light can be list through ﬁltering or lensing features.
Therefore, a LED lamp deliver more light and with a higher lumen output and this
makes the LED much more efﬁcient [7]. Plus, the LED cost will continue to decrease
and savings will increase [8]. Again, this is an important information since we are used
to think in watt unit, and we neglect the part that different technologies have different
unit measures and the light itself have other characteristics (the light beam of a LED is
more accurate than a light beam of the older technologies, so we should not compare
them if we do not have this in mind).
Another fact is that conventional lighting ﬁxtures are tested using the relative
photometry method, where lamps and luminaires are tested separately. So, the lumen
output of a ﬁxture´s lamp is a reference and the lumen output is a percentage of total
lamp lumens, which in turn is the efﬁciency of the luminaire [7]. Then again, LEDs are
inseparable from the luminaires, so LED are tested using absolute photometry. But then
again, in absolute photometry lamp lumens are not measured, just ﬁxture lumena are.
In addition, there is another difference between LED and older lighting systems,
since CRI (Colour Rendering Index) is not the best for measuring the ability of a light
corresponds to the real colour. For example, natural light have an IRC of 100, whereas
a CFL (compact ﬂuorescent light) have an IRC between 50 and 70 and many LEDs
have 90+. Colour Quality Scale (CQS) (CIE TC1-69) involves aspects of colour like
colour rendering and chromatic discrimination. The major differences between CQS
(Fig. 2) and CRI are that the ﬁrst takes into account subjective colour saturation per-
ception, measures colour ﬁdelity according to colour saturation preferences, and like
CRI identiﬁes the colour with a number [9]. Nonetheless, many LEDs have very little
red content, some have a negative R9 value (CRI is based on R1–R8. R9 is one of 6
saturated colours not used in calculating CRI.) [8].
As we can see in the Fig. 3, LEDs have a peak wavelength in the blue light range
and this is another huge difference between the older lighting systems (Figs. 3 and 4).
Moreover, blue light is the dangerous part of the visible spectrum, since it generates
ROS (reactive oxygen species) in the retina. ROS like lipofuscin (the age pigment,
which starts to build up in childhood) accumulates over the years [10]. ROS has been
linked in the pathogenesis of retinal degenerative diseases such as AMD (age-related
macular degeneration), and can cause photochemical damage, leading to the death by
Fig. 2. Colour Quality Scale (CQS) (CIE TC1-69) [9].

apoptosis ﬁrst of RPE (retinal pigmental epithelial) cells and afterwards of photore-
ceptors [11]. RPE cells are the photoreceptors suppliers of nutrients and thus, vital to
the renewal of visual pigments and promotes the functioning of photoreceptors. So,
blue light damages RPE which are our allies against lipofuscin, and ROS. And, these
facts, are of extreme importance when we are working with elderly people, since the
laboral laws are changing and we will have people with more than 65 years old
working. We must be aware that as the eye ages, light transmission and absorption also
change, because of the yellowing of the crystalline lens and repair mechanisms will be
less operational [11]. Besides, pupil size also decreases and will disrupt the
photo-entrainment of circadian rhythm, since less light enters in the eye. It is important
to retain that blue light constricts pupil, increasing visual acuity. Conversely, LEDs do
not emit ultraviolet (UV), which can cause sunburn (skin) or have effects in a
cellular/DNA level, or infrared (IR) radiation, that can promote discomfort due to the
heat that it creates. And, yes, we already seen that blue light is important for our
nonvisual system [12]. However, even though the eye have natural mechanisms of
defence, we have also seen that they are less effective during the time.
The IESNA (Illuminating Engineering Society of North America) in Recommended
Practice 27 [10] classify light sources according to their level of radiation risk. It consists
in four classes, from 0 to 3 exempt (risk groups). Exempt group O (RG0) is the one
where light sources do not pose a photobiological hazard for 10,000 s (about 2.8 h).
Whereas RG1 (Risk Group 1 or Low Risk) is that light sources in this group exceed the
limits of RG0, but do not pose a hazard due to normal behavioural limitations on
exposure, with maximum exposure times are between 100 and 10.000 s. While, RG2
(Moderate Risk) is that where light sources are longer than RG1, but do not pose a
hazard due to the aversive response to very bright light or to thermal discomfort,
between 0.25 and 100 s. Any light source in Risk Group 3 (High Risk) is believed to
pose a hazard, even for momentary exposures, less than 0.25 s (Table 1) [12].
To sum up, we must have in mind the differences and the concepts stated above
when choosing a LED, since it will be the lighting system of the future and for this
reason it is, somewhat, considered the smart lighting system. However, this smartness
is due to other factor, such as that LED chips can dim, but not all LED ﬁxtures. Even
though, LEDs can be more efﬁcient when they dim because the run cooler when

dimmed. Flicker, nonetheless, can be a downside of LEDs because some LEDs drivers
have visible and nonvisible ﬂicker. There are two kinds of ﬂicker, visual and nonvisual,
but the last one can be sensed. The negative side effects of both can cause headaches,
eyestrain and even seizures. However, dimming LED systems can have little or no
ﬂicker when dimming. The answer may turn out to be using sensors on the exterior,
controls and occupancy sensors in order to automatically adjust light levels, CCT and
colour, dependent on the task that is undertaken [8]. LEDs with tuneable Kelvin and
intensity can be the right answer (Fig. 5). However, there are many issues that we have
not got the best answer as we already stated.

open-space ofﬁces, the technological revolution that stimulates evolution [14]. Smart

Work is a new way of working due to advances in technology. These changes will
inﬂuence the way we work. There are several beneﬁts from smart working, such as
creating ofﬁce atmospheres that promotes collaboration and innovation, or by reducing
environmental footprint. In order to achieve that we need to implement ﬂexible
working options, technologies that support ﬂexible working, reduce physical meetings
and use repeatedly virtual contact. It is necessary to start implementing a more mod-
ernized working practice, which empower employees with the possibility of choosing
where and when they work, and therefore they will have a more balanced
work-personal life, and will be healthier and consequently more productive. It is not
just a matter of doing the same with new technologies but creating new ways and
approaches. We have to step aside from the Taylorism approach to the workplace, just
because the focus must be on the people and not, only, on the costs [14].
And for that we have to achieve different environments, more ﬂexible and less
rigid. For example, provide different lighting systems from the ones that are used
actually, not a static light but a dynamic one. The use of task light could improve the
employee’s ‘wellbeing since each one could adjust the light to their needs, preferences,
according with the task performed. Besides, with age we need more light as well as the
people that have some kind of visual impairment and the ones that are younger and
with a perfect visual acuity [8]. For instance, a light with 8200 K is the best option for
elderly, since they feel less fatigued. Moreover, visual functions are worse - like visual
acuity and accommodation - and pathologies such as cataracts begin to appear, besides
the lens yellowing that degrades the colour’s distinction. On the other hand, the most
suitable correlated colour temperature (CCT) for young people is 2500 K, as we can
see it is a huge gap between them. Thus, it seems that 5000 K, a value between 8200 K
and 2500 K, is a CTT that can be considered pleasant for both. So, we can stabilise a
medium CCT in order to respond to all ages, however, as we stated it may not be the
best one. Today, we live in a society that has a role-model of “one size ﬁts all”, but the
truth is that it can ﬁts all but only in a medium way. If we know that our needs are
different why do we insist that we have all to be alike? We are different, social,
economic and culturally, just to name a few, so why do we keep to say that we are all
equal? To make us get along and accept our differences is one thing, to see us all by the
same ruler is another thing. So, besides the stated above, we must not forget, other
issues like how to avoid glare sources. This is another concern because adjusting light,
is not just a question of preference, a health related issue or an age concern. Lighting
systems, at workplaces, are usually located in the ceiling and many times are controlled
by one person for all the building, or for all the ﬂoor. But as we have already seen, there
is too much questions that we have to answer, so the best way to answer it can be,
simply, allow people to decide if they want to, or need to, move the lamp or re-direct it.
Another curiosity is that the computers have a screen that is auto-illuminated so we do
not need more light to see it, because it is already lighted. In fact, less light is better
than more light. Flexibility is the right word [8].
The accelerating pace of our modern life turns into something that if we do not
evolve along will, eventually, play against us. Technology surpasses us really fast and
we must stop to think how can we take beneﬁt from it. And this beneﬁt is not based on
costs; it should be in the promotion of users’ health and wellbeing. Since technology
removes obstacles we should not make, create or continue to suffer their consequences.
Smart Workplaces, Smart Lighting and Smart Glass
441

One example of this can be the poor postures that increases the risk of musculoskeletal
disorders and carpal tunnel syndrome as a consequence of the new technologies. When
we seat on an ergonomic chair and look over a pc monitor our eye should look straight
forward and our posture should be aligned, but when we look to a tablet or smartphone
our posture is misaligned, which will lead to pain and will do long-term harm to our
bodies [14].
So, besides lighting needs, wellbeing in a more general way, is also a challenge for
the most recent workspaces. Stress plays an important role, but as we had already
stated, can happen due to lighting characteristics too. The empowerment of the
employees in order to permit that they can control their environmental cues individ-
ually can turn out to be a headache. In an open space, it is almost impossible to do so.
Thus, the spaces and its compartmentation have to change inevitably. In spite of the
fact that employees may not have the right knowledge of certain areas that gives them
the information that can, directly and indirectly, help them to achieve health and
wellbeing. They might be misinformed.
2.4
Wellbeing
As regards wellbeing, besides the facts that have already been discussed and state there
is also the fact that people have been dependent and evolved under the natural light,
sunlight, and Earth’s natural cycle (latitude, longitude and seasonal [8]. In the morning,
the light is very different from the light at midday. Low light level and a warm CCT are
the characteristics of the morning and of the late afternoon, while at the midday is the
opposite, a high light level and a cool CCT [8]. Once again, the natural light is dynamic
and our timings (circadian rhythms) are related to its timing. We are spending too much
time of our lives inside buildings of some sort whereas until not so long ago we were
attuned to outside environment. Artiﬁcial light is very different from the natural one
and its impact on our visual and nonvisual systems is questionable.
2.5
Smart Glass
Research over the last decade leads to the development of new and adaptive materials,
and glass in no exception. Smart windows are smart devices that are able to respond to
variations in temperature, solar radiation and might reduce the energy consumption and
increase comfort at indoor environment, such as workplaces [15].
Windows can increase the energy consumption and heat gain. Smart glass could be
an excellent way of improving energy consumption as well as adjust the glass char-
acteristics to our needs. For example, we can turn the glass less clear and increase
privacy when required. There are several types of smart glasses (Fig. 6), such as liquid
crystal (LC), low-emissivity (low-E), thermochromics, electro comic and SPD (sus-
pended particle devices). Besides, liquid crystal, electrochromic and SPD are all
electrically activated and are the different devices of electro tropic [15]. For a better
understanding, let us discuss the concept and the main advantages and disadvantages of
each type (liquid crystal (LC), low-emissivity (low-E), thermochromics, electro comic
and SPD).
442
S. Preto and C.C. Gomes

Firstly, liquid crystal glass is made up of two sheets of glass with a liquid crystal
ﬁlm between them. When the electric ﬁeld is applied the orientation of LC chains are
altered and the optical transmission of the glass too. And, without electric ﬁeld the
molecules are scattered and visual light is diffused, which gives the translucent effect.
The main advantage is that we can adjust its opacity however, the down side is that it
does not conserve energy (Fig. 7).
Whereas the advantages of Low-E glass is that it limits ultraviolet light from getting
in, which in turn will protect the furniture from fading, reduce sound levels indoors and
decrease the energy costs. As for disadvantage it is more expensive than regular glass
and no control over the visible light (Fig. 8).
Thirdly, thermochromics glass continuously adapts its tint to sunlight and in that
way, manages the heat and glare without power supply. Even though, it cannot be
manually controlled due to the fact that is a passive technology, which responds to
environmental changes in temperature, and may not receive from sunlight the right
amount in order to darken (Fig. 9).
Fourthly, electrochromic glass is dependent on electrical current for changing its
colour state. Among the its beneﬁts is the possibility to include sensor to automatically
tint the glass, this control of each window can be through manual control, in this way
we can have more natural light without interrupting views which will increase comfort
and productivity (Fig. 10) [15, 16].
Lastly, SPD is a type of glass based on a ﬁlm technology and have a uniform
response all over the ﬁlm. When no electrical charge is applied the particles are in
random positions and block light transmission while turning in a dark blue tint.
Whereas with charge the particles align and let the light get through. When the switch
is on, the glass turns clear, allowing 45% visible light transmission. When there is no

current the glass is blue tint and allows less than 1% of visible light transmission.
Besides, in all states it rejects 99% of ultraviolet light transmission. Advantages of
SPD: optical view through the window, even with bluish tint is possible to see through
the glass, and a comfortable room temperature can be maintained thus preventing
unwanted ﬂuctuation linked with the change of external temperature [15].
From the Fig. 11, we can see that SPD have the best performance in reducing

Discussion
Flexibility seems to be a better word than smart. We will explain this for each
technology/concept in this paper discussed. Actually, we do not need a smart light we
need a dynamic one, which is more similar to natural light since it is by sunlight that we
evolved as a specie. So, we need a lighting systems that provides a wider range of CCT,
light intensities (Lux, watt, lumen), lighting systems layout (where is the light/lamp?
What is its orientation, towards a paper – horizontal – a computer screen – vertical?).
These are all questions about light, there is not a god or a bad answer, it all as to do
with the case to solve: where is the building located? Does it have east and west light?
Besides, an endless variables, the light itself, the artiﬁcial light, must answering to
many issues, and it seems that a light which varies all over the day with an “automatic”
adjustment can be the better choice, once this is the most ﬂexible solution. Permit to
users a control over their workstations can be a helpful way of give them the autonomy
over their comfort and wellbeing. As for, a smart workplace, well a smart workplace
besides the technology, nowadays, it is an old concept. The majority of individuals
work in computers, which are presenting smaller and smaller dimensions. So, we do
not have to be seated at a desk all day long. We can work in a patio, or somewhere else,
we just have to be wired to Wi-Fi and have a computer, a smartphone, or a tablet. And,
if it is so, why do we must kept in one room with the same persons all day long? We

may need some silence around us in order to keep us concentrated on the undertaken
tasks. Or we are very sociable persons and need to have people around us to achieve the
same purposes (to be concentrated). We may appreciate to have a natural place near or
we may prefer the rush of a city trafﬁc and its related characteristics sounds. Tech-
nology is offering us the freedom of choice, we can work (almost from) anywhere.
Well, honestly, we should not work everywhere and in every way but at least we can
move around, choose different ambiences, desks, seats, lights, people around. Once
again, ﬂexibility is the right word. Lastly, smart windows, are they smart? Yes, they are
if we think of energy consumption, privacy issues (tinting the glass, or unclear it). But,
what was identiﬁed as a one of the major health problems nowadays, around the globe?
The lack of vitamin D is, for sure, one that have been underestimated and the majority
of this smart glasses simply limit the ultraviolet light indoors, and by doing so, the
UVB light does not enter inside precisely when the people should be exposed to it
(from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.). So, we are protecting the surfaces and furniture from fading
from ultraviolet but we are putting us in danger. And, what is more important? The
furniture or individuals? Once more, this is a recent technology, and we must to turn it
into a more ﬂexible one: we can limit the ultraviolet radiation from getting in, but at the
same time, we should allow it for some time during the day, forty minutes during the
summer is enough, for instance. For this technology being considered smart we must
(and all of the types of glass here stated are taking the ﬁrst steps) turn them more
ﬂexible and architects and designers ought to be more informed about health, sus-
tainability and management related issues. Despite our academic level and professional
competencies, we must, and we need, to get smarter.

Abstract. Obesity is an emerging health problem and its incidence has been
increasing throughout the workforce. In occupational contexts, the vertical
handling tasks, including lifting and lowering loads, are common and can
produce signiﬁcant musculoskeletal overloads for the involved workers. In this
ﬁeld, the Infrared Thermography (IRT) has emerged as a potential technique to
analyze risk factors for Work related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSD).
Thus, this study aims at comparing the surface temperature changes over 16
Regions of Interest (ROI) across a sample of individuals with different levels of
obesity, when performing a vertical handling task. The results pointed out that,
for all considered ROI, the skin temperature decreases after the task and obese
subjects seems to present a higher decrease, comparing with the non-obese.
Negative temperature variations may present a higher risk of WMSD due to
blood ﬂow restriction. This study provides evidences that obesity is a WMSD
risk factor during handling tasks.

Introduction
Obesity is currently referred to as a 21st century epidemic public health problem,
affecting both developed and developing countries. Over the years, European countries,
including Portugal, have been following the global tendency of overweight and obesity
increasing. In the last two decades, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated
that obesity has increased three times [1]. In Portugal, statistical data demonstrates that
the people with unhealthy weight are more than 50% of all population [2]. Obviously,
obese people represent a signiﬁcant fraction of the global working population [3].
However, several studies have demonstrated that obesity can cause limitations, both in
daily life and in the individual’s work activity. For example, workers with overweight
are absent from work due to illness more frequently and for long periods than employees
with normal weight [4], being this absenteeism frequently related to WMSD [5].

In the occupational context, obesity is an individual factor that may compromise the
work ability, for example through changes in the individual’s postural balance [6]. This
evidence gains more emphasis through results that point out that obese workers report a
higher perceived overload during tasks of holding loads at different postures [7].
However, the effect of obesity in postural work maintenance is a condition that is rarely
studied. Furthermore, in ergonomic interventions at workplaces, the postural analysis
tools seem to consider only workers with a normal weight.
It should be noted that one of the disorders caused by stressful postures is back
pain. From the biomechanical point of view, excessive body weight can negatively
affect the muscles and spine behavior during handling tasks. Different studies have
found positive relations between obesity and back pain [8], as well as the decrease in
the trunk muscle strength [9]. However, the epidemiologic literature research has not
clearly demonstrated the link between low back pain and obesity [10].
In this context, several ﬁndings have shown that workers who perform manual
handling loads are exposed to a greater risk of having back pain and WMSD, compared
with those that their jobs do not require this type of tasks [11]. This type of tasks,
including lifting and lowering (in this paper designated as vertical handling tasks), is
very frequent in the occupational contexts and are associated with the WMSD
appearance in the workers who develop them [12], which justiﬁes the choice of these
tasks as object of study in the current investigation.
This type of tasks involves several muscle groups that contract and relax, during
dynamic work performance. This whole process involves different physiological pro-
cesses to which heat release is associated. Heat transfer, in the objects, as in the human
body, can occur by 3 main ways: conduction, convection and radiation [13]. IRT
captures the natural radiation emitted by a body surface, but it has to present a tem-
perature above zero [14]. For this, the infrared cameras have heat detection capability,
based on the sensitivity to the electromagnetic waves emitted by the human body,
which reﬂect the molecular agitation of the tissues [14]. The high-resolution images
captured expose the skin temperature, using a quantitative color scale. This skin
temperature depends on the combination of blood ﬂow, energy expenditure and
nutrient metabolism, and can provide important data about physiological function of
the tissues [15].
It is important to mention that IRT is a non-invasive and non-ionizing technique,
being innocuous for those who participate in the study [14]. In the last years, IRT has
been widely used for clinical purposes, namely in the diagnosis of musculoskeletal
disorders, oncology, vascular disorders, arthritis, sports medicine, among others [15].
This technique has also been applied as a valid option in WMSD risk factors
assessment. Different exploratory studies have shown that variations in skin tempera-
ture are related to physiological responses to speciﬁc conditions of occupational tasks.
These evidences were found in tasks with static exertions (overhead tapping tasks) [16,
17] and repetitive muscular work (typing task in work ofﬁce) [18, 19], essentially for
the body regions of hands, shoulders and forearms.
In summary, obesity can affect individual work ability, including performance
during vertical handling tasks. Although obesity has already been widely studied, there
are some controversies associated with this individual factor, and further studies are
needed. In addition, it should be noted that IRT is a direct measurement technique

applicable to WMSD risk factors assessment. Therefore, the objective of the current
work is to perform an exploratory study to assess and analyze surface temperature
chances in individuals with different obesity levels, during vertical handling tasks.

Methodology
2.1
Participants and Experimental Task
Twenty-nine participants (10 females and 19 males) without symptoms and no previous
record of musculoskeletal disorders were recruited. After signing an informed consent
form, different individuals’ anthropometric data were quantiﬁed, such as Body Mass
Index (BMI) and Waist Circumference (WC). Additionally, an OMRON® BF306 body
fat monitor was used to measure the Body Fat Mass (BFM) percentage, determined by
bioelectrical impedance, which also integrates personal data (height, weight, age and
gender), in order to accurately deﬁne individual obesity levels [20]. Mean and Standard
Deviation (SD) of the personal data are presented in Table 1.
Considering the BMI, the participants can be distributed across 3 obesity levels [1],
namely: (i) normal (n = 18); (ii) overweight (n = 7); and (iii) obese (n = 4). The WC
measures the abdominal fat and has been used to predict the risk of cardiovascular
disease related to obesity [2]. Considering participants’ WC and gender, different levels
of risk of disease can be deﬁned, such as: (i) normal (n = 16); (ii) high risk (n = 5); and
(iii) very high risk (n = 8). Relatively to the BFM percentage, the body fat monitor
deﬁned the following obesity levels: (i) normal or non-obese (n = 10); (ii) high (n =
13); and (iii) very high (n = 6). All participants were instructed to avoid drink, eat and
smoke at least 2 h before the test.
In a laboratorial context, each participant performed a repeated and symmetrical
task of lifting, and replacing, a box with a load of 7 kg, between ﬂoor and shoulders
height. The periodicity of the repetitions was 7 s, during 2 min. The task was per-
formed in a postural constrained condition, likewise the box was placed behind a
60 cm high barrier simulating one side of an industrial bin. The high barrier was
constructed to measure 120% of average male and female knee heights [21]. This
experimental design took into account the guidelines published by the National Insti-
tute Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) [22].

Thermographic Data Collection and Analysis
The participants acclimated themselves to the laboratory climatic conditions (mean
relative humidity 58.2 ± 1.7%, mean temperature 23.3 ± 1.2 °C, no direct ventilation
and ﬂuorescent lighting over the subject) during 15 min, without clothing, accessories
and hair over the body regions of neck, arms and upper trunk [23].
Before and after the vertical handling task performance, thermal images from
anterior and dorsal corporal views were collected, including the body regions men-
tioned above. During the measurements each participant were stand up and set 3 m
from the infrared camera in an uniform background. The infrared camera used in this
study was a FLIR® E60sc, with a sensor array size of 320  240, NETD of 50 mK at
30 °C and traceability of ±2% of the overall temperature range reading (Fig. 1). The
emissivity value was set to 0.98, considering the value of human skin emissivity
suggested by the most of researchers who apply IRT [24, 25].
The software used to load and process the thermal images was the FLIR Ther-
maCam Researcher Pro 2.10®. In this study, 16 ROI were studied (Table 2 and Fig. 2),
being their deﬁnition made according to the Glamorgan protocol [26] and the software
quantiﬁed the skin mean temperature for each ROI. The ROI selection was supported

by the functionality of muscles and articulations, located in these regions, during this
type of tasks. In addition, it was observed that fat mass accumulation was not high in
these body regions, which, had it been, might have compromised thermographic data
acquisition.
Considering that the BFM is a factor which can inﬂuence the skin mean temper-
atures [25] and the participants presented different levels of obesity, the analysis of the
thermographic results was made from the delta of temperatures (DT) calculating. For
each ROI, DT was determined by the algebraic difference between the skin mean
temperature measure after the task performance minus the basal temperature (measured
before the task), as suggested by Formenti et al. [27]. The values for this variable could
be either positive or negative depending whether skin mean temperature increased or
decreased during the vertical handling task.
Relatively to statistical analysis, it was performed using the IBM® SPSS®
Statistics 24.0 software. The DT data were presented as mean and SD corresponding.
The normality of the distribution of the personal data and skin mean temperatures was
checked by the Shapiro-Wilk’s test. All the parameters did meet the assumption of
normality. For this reason, a Pearson test was applied in order to check if the DT
increase/decrease is correlated with the individuals’ obesity level increase (measured by
BMI, WC and BFM percentage).

Results and Conclusions
Concerning DT values, a descriptive statistical summary of these values across the 16 ROI
and the different obesity levels (deﬁned by IMC, WC and BFM) is provided in Table 3.
The DT mean values are negative for all ROI considered, indicating a cooling of the
surface areas, potentially a result of the vertical handling task performance. These results
pointed out that skin temperature decrease after the task. This evidence showed that IRT
are sensitive to identify skin temperature differences caused by vertical handling tasks

performance, providing a preliminary demonstration that IRT may be useful in quanti-
fying work tasks demands (as supported by Barker et al. [16]).
Furthermore, comparing the DT mean values between groups with different obesity
levels, the results suggest that there is a tendency to increase skin cooling for the
participants with higher obesity levels.
A decrease in skin temperature during and at the end of an exercise, as reported by
the current results, was previously observed by some studies [16, 27–29]. Regarding
the reason of that skin cooling, this is associated with changes in blood ﬂow. A study in
this ﬁeld [30] demonstrated that during continuous muscle contractions performance
with moderate intensity, as with the repetition of lifting and lowering a load, even with
a slow movement, suppression of blood inﬂow and outﬂow of the involved muscles
occurs, increasing the muscle deoxygenation. In the present study, it is considered that
the skin cooling, measured after the vertical handling task, is also due to vasocon-
striction, potentiating the probability increase of occurrence of musculoskeletal prob-
lems. For example, one cause of shoulders’ WMSD is poor blood ﬂow in the tendons
due to muscle contraction and pressure exerted by surrounding bones during tasks
involving arms elevation [31].
Concerning the Pearson test, this test demonstrated that an increasing obesity level
is related to a decreasing of skin temperature, but it is statistical signiﬁcant (p < 0.05)
for a few of the ROI analyzed, namely for right anterior shoulder joint (ROI 01), lower
ligaments of left anterior shoulder (ROI 05) and left anterior arm (ROI 08).
As mentioned above, the decrease of skin temperature is related to the vasocon-
striction occurred during muscular exercise. Negative temperature variations may
present a higher risk of WMSD due to blood ﬂow restriction. Therefore, the current
investigation corroborates the established idea that obesity is a relevant and an emer-
gent WMSD risk factor in particular in what concerns vertical handling tasks. This
study also provides preliminary evidences that IRT may be an useful assessment tool in
ergonomic studies. However, future studies will have to consider an increasing sample
size to achieve more statistical power.

Abstract. The importance of safety culture has been the focus of research
attention in many sectors in Malaysia for many years in order to achieve a
positive safety environment at a workplace. However, the safety culture among
teachers in education sector has rarely been examined especially in school. Four
factors were focused in this study; safety policies, safety procedures, safety
training and safety committee as factors that leads to safety culture in school.

focused in this research were used to collect data from 111 schools in Kelantan,
which is one of the states in Malaysia. The number of returned valid ques-
tionnaires was 408. Conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) with Amos 19 was used
to analyze the data. The measurement model shows that the four factors of
situational dimensions lead to the safety culture among teachers in school. The
results of the analysis indicated that safety policy, safety training and the safety
committee would do well to increase the safety culture in education sector.

Introduction
School environment is an environment which the students spend one third of their daily
life with their teachers and students [15]. Schools have the mission of instruction as
well as education on the students. Therefore, students should feel themselves in a safe
environment so that effective learning occurs. There are many factors that put students
at risk to injuries including poor monitoring and supervision of children, risk-taking
behaviors among students, poor-decision skills among students, inadequately main-
tained equipment, lack of staff awareness of injury prevention, lack of conditioning
especially in sports-related injuries and lack of knowledge regarding appropriate safety
procedures [11].

The speciﬁc principles are reductions in number of accidents and incidents,
ensuring that safety issues receive appropriate attention, ensuring that organizational
members share the same ideas and beliefs about risks, accidents, and ill related to
health and, determining the style and proﬁciency of an organization’s health and safety
programs [14]. Safety deﬁned as liberation from risk, injury and danger. In addition,
safety can also be the manifestation of “caution” in order to avoid danger [8]. Culture is
deﬁned as the values and beliefs that are being shared in order to create an identity of a
group of people [8]. Therefore, safe work culture can be deﬁned as the patterns of
behaviours and attitudes or products of people, which creates commitment and efﬁ-
ciency in an organization [8].
Safety culture plays a key function in determining an organization’s success or
failure [14]. A development of positive safety culture provided little guidance on how
organizations might reduce the numbers of accident occurred at a workplace. A goal of
positive safety culture is to create an atmosphere in which employees are aware of the
risk in their workplace, continually on guard against them, and avoid taking any unsafe
actions. Organizations strive for minimum accidents at workplace. Workplace safety
can boost employees’ performance in which workers are not burdened by the harm or
danger on their wellbeing. Hence, it is important for organizations to build high safety
culture at workplace.
1.1
Safety Issues in Malaysian Education Sector
During 2012–2016, the statistic of occupational accident reported in Malaysia illus-
trated that the increasing number of accidents in services sector and statutory bodies
[3]. Table 1 shows the statistics report by Department Of Occupational Safety and
Health (DOSH) in that sector. Even tough, the statistic data on accidents occurred in
this sector quite low than other sector such as manufacturing, construction and others,
the accidents and their consequences continue to be a major public health concern.
Newspaper keeps reporting on many accident cases occurred in education sector
showing the level of safety culture in this sector especially in education sector is quite
low. Table 2 shows a summary of the literature on the newspaper report on the types of
accidents occured in school environment from year 2015 to end of 2016.

Safety Culture and Its Contributing Factor in Education Sector
457

Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) 1994 stated that the self regulation
concept was promulgated based on the primary responsibility of ensuring safety, health
and welfare of all persons at all places of work. Therefore, an introduction of safety
culture can be seen as a systematic solution towards the establishment of zero accidents
in the workplace [18]. The Malaysian Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994
(OSHA 1994) provides a legislative framework to promote, stimulate and encourage
high standards of safety and health at workplace. The aim of the act is to promote safety
and health awareness and establish effective programmes to suit the industries needs
and implementation of the law through self-regulation schemes is designed to suit
particular organization. The long-term goal of the act is to create a healthy and safe
working culture among all Malaysian employees and employers. A school is consid-
ered a place of work. In the OSHA 1994, “place of work” means premises where
persons work or premises used for the storage of plant and substance. Therefore,
students and teachers are not left behind [13].
Therefore, duties of the teachers are to ensure safety and avoid existing hazards
teacher and students at school environment. According to this scenario, this study was
carried out to measure the factors that contribute to the safety culture school teacher in
Malaysian in order to get more input on the condition of safety culture in malaysian
education that causes so many cases of accidents among teacher and students in school.
1.2
Safety Culture in Its Contributing Factors
Many debates have emerged among researchers on the deﬁnitions of safety culture.
This paper particularly adopts deﬁnitions by [2] in which safety culture reﬂects the
attitudes, beliefs, perceptions, and values that employees share in relation to safety. The
Reciprocal Safety Culture Model presents an integrative way of thinking about many
processes that impact on safety culture, a set of measurement techniques that do not
depend solely on incident or accident index and, a dynamic framework that can be
performed a multilevel analysis of the safety culture. It also emphasized that the safety
culture can be measured by examining the reciprocal interaction between safety
management systems; people perceptions about safety and people’s actual safety
related behavior [2]. The organizational dimension can be measured via safety man-
agement systems audits/inspections where it analyzed the structure of management

systems, policies and working procedures [1]. An intention of this study was focused
on organizational/situational dimension (safety management systems), which are safety
procedure, safety policy, safety training and safety committee; in order to see how the
management system especially related to safety in school can contribute towards safety
culture in school. The study focused the investigation on examining whether all the
factors can contribute to teachers’ safety culture at school. Enhancing safety culture is
important to the success of health and safety at work.
Employees who abide by safety regulations will establish an organization that has
an improved safety culture [10]. Employees did not have experience in any of the
incidents and accidents while performing their duties when they comply with any
regulations, procedures and instructions while performing the task [14]. Safety training
can help to raise awareness and efﬁciency of employees and related parties to work
safely and to foster a positive safety culture within the organization [4]. It is the key to
success in any organization for the prevention of accidents at work [16]. Safety
committee is an effective strategy to create a safe workplace as they are the one
involved in the daily operation of the workplace where safety is constantly an issue [9].
Safety committee can provide a channel for employee to provide their input on safety
issues affecting them and this will reduce accidents at the workplace [6, 9]. The
framework of this study is illustrated in Fig. 1.

Method
An intention of this study was focused on four variables such as safety policies, safety
procedures, safety training, safety committee that contributes to safety culture, we
utilized a quantitative approach. We developed a questionnaire that was adapted from
previously published questionnaires addressing the issues on variables of our interests.
The measurement model was estimated by structural equation modeling (SEM), which
is a powerful multivariate technique for analysing causal models. The measurement
model is estimated using conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test whether the latent
variables possess sufﬁcient construct validity.

Sample description
The questionnaire was adapted from a survey questions by [4, 8, 14, 16, 18]. Each item
was measured on a ﬁve point Likert scale, ranging from strongly disagree (= 1) to
strongly agree (=5). Data were collected from 408 teachers from 111 public schools in
Kelantan, Malaysia using stratiﬁed random sampling. The participants in this study were
teachers from both primary and secondary schools from every district of Kelantan.
2.2
Reliability
To examine the internal consistent reliability of the observed item questionnaire,
Cronbach’s alpha was assessed. The resulting alpha values ranged from .847 to .917,
which were above the acceptable threshold, as shown in Table 3.

Assessment of the Measurement Model
The measurement model was assessed by conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA).
According to [12], the measurement model should be evaluated ﬁrst before generating
the best overall model ﬁt. The measurement model was evaluated using conﬁrmatory
factor analysis to assess the factorial validity of the measurement model. The values for
composite reliability (CR) and average variance expected (AVE) were needed in order
to obtain the divergent validity. [17] suggest that the recommended threshold of average
variance extracted is 0.5, while [5] suggest that the recommended threshold of com-
posite reliability should be greater than 0.7. All composite reliabilities measures of
constructs exceed the recommended threshold of 0.7. The factor loadings that are

smaller than the recommended level of 0.5 should be removed. Discriminant validity
can be tested by comparing the square roots of the AVE with the correlations among the
constructs. All of the square roots of the AVE by constructs were greater than the
correlation among constructs as shown in Table 3, so discriminant validity was sup-
ported. In brief, the measurement model assessment, including convergent and dis-
criminate validity measures, was satisfactory. The overall model ﬁt was assessed in
terms of four measures. These indices included: the chi-square/degree of freedom (v2/d.
f), the traditional chi-square (CMIN), the degree of freedom (DF), the Comparative Fit
of Index (CFI) and the Root Mean Square of Error Approximation (RMSEA) [5] to
obtain a model ﬁt. The CFI value must exceed 0.90 and the RMSEA value must be
lower than 0.08 [5] in order to obtain an acceptable ﬁt with the data and the v2/d.f should
not exceed 3. Accordingly, all the ﬁtness measures in this research fell into acceptable
ranges using CFA. Consequently, the proposed model provided a suitable ﬁt.
We estimated the proposed model by using structural equation modeling with the
maximum likelihood estimation method. The chi-square goodness- of- ﬁt test showed
that the model did not ﬁt the data well, 2 = 1032.420. Although the model did not ﬁt
well by the chi-square test, the baseline comparisons ﬁt indices of CFI were close to or
exceeded 0.9 (CFI = 0.874) and the ratio chi-square/d.f. is 4.197. The RMSEA showed
a value of 0.089 indicating a good model ﬁt. Accordingly, the recommended thresholds
and results of the measurement model ﬁtness indicate a good model ﬁt. Figure 2 shows
the results of the measurement model.

Discussion and Recommendations
This study was conducted to assess the reliability and validity of the factors con-
tributing to safety culture among teachers in education sector by applying conﬁrmatory
factor analysis to a Malaysian case. The results of the CFA provided support for a
four-factor model situational dimension of safety culture. Results suggested that the
four-factor model was the best overall ﬁt to the data. Four indicators related to safety
policy, safety procedure, safety training and safety committee represented the situa-
tional dimension.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this study added to the body of literature about safety culture and its
contributing factors. The results of this study emphasizes on the importance of safety
policy, safety training and safety committee to increase safety culture among school-
teacher. In generalizing the study results, however, we need to be cautious due to the
limitation: the data were collected only from primary and secondary school in Kelantan
whish is one of the states in Malaysia. Despite the limitation, the results of this study
can be used by Education Ministry of Malaysia specially the school management to
gain knowledge on the importance of safety training and safety committee to increase
safety culture at workplace. The Ministry of Education also could play more important
role in the primary prevention of accidents and injuries as well as promotion of Safety

and Health in schools through advocacy, data collection and education as well as of
research to address this problem. Safety culture is a main goal of most companies,
especially those with high risks workplace like manufacture companies. Laboratories
and workshops in schools is a risky place and require more attention from the man-
agement to make this a better place to work safely. Safety culture among teachers in
education environment, which is school, plays an important role in making education
sites a safer and healthier place to work for them and for students to learn. Finally, we
call future research to address aspects that were not included in this study, to better
evaluate the safety issues at school environment.

Abstract. In many industrial systems, equipment failures and worker accidents
result from contributing events which occur in a certain sequence in time. These
events must be analyzed, assessed and prioritized. This endeavor can be hindered
by the fact that, in real life, often, the data associated with these events are not
known precisely. Fuzzy numbers, provide a method for taking into account the
uncertainty problem. Dynamic fault trees and Markov analyses, on the other hand,
provide a means of handling the sequential character of events which can lead to
work accidents. Thus, in this paper, a system safety analysis is performed using
fuzzy dynamic fault tree method and Markov analysis. A simple example is used
to demonstrate this approach. In the ﬁrst part of this paper, the relevant dynamic
fault tree and Markov diagram are drawn and the fuzzy probability of occurrence
of the accident under consideration is evaluated. The probability is calculated,
not on the basis of theoretical values but, rather, on qualitative evaluation given
by press brake operators in the ﬁeld.
Keywords: Fuzzy Markov chain · Dynamic fault tree

Introduction
Traditional fault tree analysis takes a static view of the system; that is, the sequence in
which the events leading to the undesirable event happens is not taken into account.
Sometimes the sequence is important in determining the outcome. For example, consider
the operation of a power press. If the protective device fails before the operator reaches
into the hazardous zone of the machine, the operator may not be aware of it and the
machine may not be set-up to stop in case of such a failure. In that case, the motion of
the press may not be stopped and the operator’s arms and hands may be caught in the
closing dies of the press. If, on the other hand, the failure of the device occurs after the
operator reached in the press, the hazardous motion may have stopped and the failure
will not have initiated any further motion. Thus, no accident occurs. A traditional fault
tree analysis would not have diﬀerentiated these two sequences. To remedy this deﬁ‐
ciency, several approaches have been proposed. In [1], Dugan et al. have used an
approach by which sub-trees are identiﬁed with dynamic gates. In [2], Amari proposed

a method where the dynamic fault tree is solved without converting it to a Markov model.
In [3], Bobbio et al. have used a Bayesian network-based approach to solve the problem.
All these approaches can evaluate the dynamic fault tree under consideration but
they assume that failure data or states of the systems are known and can be expressed
with exact values. But uncertainties and diﬃculties in obtaining data are a common
diﬃculty.
Fuzzy set theory ﬁrst proposed by Zadeh [4], has proven to be a useful methodology
to cope with these cases where uncertainty and scarcity of data are important features.
Li et al. [5], have solved a dynamic fault tree problem by solving the associated
Markov state equations, with fuzzy numbers in the context of the reliability analysis of
the hydraulic system of a CNC machining center. However, the origin of the fuzzy data
used in the paper is not explained. Mechri et al., in [6] have used fuzzy Markov chains
to analyze the reliability of Safety Instrumentation Systems. The data they used were
provided by one expert. However, the process by which the expert’s opinion was soli‐
cited is not explained. In this paper, a dynamic fault tree and its associated fuzzy Markov
chain is solved in the case of a diﬀerent type of industrial system, a brake press operation,
using data collected from experts.
Furthermore, in these works, the human element in the operation of these equipments
and systems is not considered. In this paper, on the other hand, we solve a fuzzy Markov
diagram model which represents the safety of a brake press operation. Besides the
machine failure, a human factor failure is also considered.

Forward Problem
The term «forward» refers to the process of evaluating the top event of a fault tree starting
from the bottom events, with everything being done in terms of fuzzy numbers (Fig. 1).
Fig. 1. Dynamic fault tree.
2.1
Fuzzy Dynamic Fault Tree (FDFT)
A dynamic fault tree is one which contains considers the sequential nature of events
which are related to the system under consideration. Referring to the ﬁgure showing a
general situation involving just two components, instead of using static AND gates as
in a traditional static fault tree, a dynamic fault tree uses a PAND gate whose output
466
T. Veditti et al.

changes to a failure state only if all of its inputs have failed in a predetermined order.
Thus, in the example shown in the ﬁgure, failure 1 occurs before event 2. When these
two events occur in that sequence, the top event of the fault tree, «system fails», occurs.
The opposite sequence, failure of component 2, X2, arising before failure of component
1, X1, does not lead to the top event. One of the uses of fault trees is to calculate prob‐
abilities of occurrences of the failures or events represented in the fault tree in question.
A fuzzy dynamic fault trees involves probabilities expressed as fuzzy numbers.
2.2
Fuzzy Markov Chain (FMC)
From a dynamic fault tree, a so-called Markov diagram can be drawn. This enables one
to write a ﬁrst-order diﬀerential state equation which can then be solved.
Markov analysis is a technique used for modeling system state transitions and calcu‐
lating the probability of reaching various system states from the model, [7].
In a Markov model, a system is supposed to possess a given number of states, each
deﬁned by a set of variables. The transitions from one discrete state i to state j are
considered to occur at transition rates λij. In a fuzzy Markov model, these transition
rates are expressed as fuzzy numbers. Fuzzy numbers are introduced to reﬂect the fact
that the possibility of a transition from one state of a system to another state is uncertain.
Markov Chains are used mainly in reliability studies involving failures of components
but can also be used in relation to human interactions with engineered systems.
2.3
Calculation of the Top Event of the Dynamic Fault Tree Using the Fuzzy
Markov Model
Conversion Between Normal Probability Distribution and Fuzzy Triangular
Numbers
In risk analysis, we often do not know the precise values of the probabilities of occur‐
rence or of failure of the systems or of its components. One way to deal with this problem
is to consider that the variables of interest follow a normal probability distribution with
a mean value and a standard deviation. However, another approach to the problem is to
use fuzzy triangular numbers.
A fuzzy number is represented by three numbers <a1, a2, a3>. Its mathematical form
and graphical shape can be given as this (Fig. 2):
Fig. 2. Triangular fuzzy number.
Dynamic Fuzzy Safety Analysis of an Industrial System
467

In this representation, a2 corresponds to a membership value of 1 meaning that we
think that the most probable value of the variable under consideration is a2. So a2 corre‐
sponds to the mean value in a normal probability distribution. In this representation, we
mean also that the variable under interest lies between the values a1 and a3, which have
“membership values” of 0. In other words, a1 and a3 resemble the 3σ values from the
mean in a standard normal probability distribution. For example, it might be ascertained
that the probability of failure of a given component is «around 0.0007». This information
could be expressed as a fuzzy number such as <0.00065, 0.00070, 0.00075>. What this
means is that we believe that the actual probability in question is most likely equal to
0.00070 but we do not believe that it could equal a value as low as 0.00065 or a value
as high as 0.00075.
Fuzziﬁcation
In the FDFT method adopted in this work, the fuzzy probabilities associated with the
basic events forming the fault tree under study are needed for the calculation of the top
event probability. These probabilities are often expressed in terms of qualitative
linguistic statements such as «the probability of this occurrence is thought to be low, or
high, or somewhat low, etc.». For calculation purposes, these statements must be trans‐
lated into fuzzy numbers (triangular in this study). This process is generally called
fuzziﬁcation in the literature.

Example
As a way of illustrating the theory, brake press operation will be considered. Before
delving into calculations, a brief overview of the process involved will be given. A press
brake is a machine commonly found in the metal manufacturing industry. It is used to
bend sheet metal in diﬀerent shapes. A typical press brake is illustrated here (Fig. 3):
Fig. 3. Press brake.
468
T. Veditti et al.

The machine is composed of two main structural components, a top beam mounted
on a plate and a bottom table. These two parts are usually connected by two C-frames
on each side of the machine. Dies are clamped on the top and bottom parts. Either the
top or the bottom half of the press then closes in (via a hydraulically-powered mecha‐
nism) on the stationary part. The operator holds the piece-part and actuates the closing
motion with a foot pedal, in most applications. A hazardous situation is thus created
from the proximity of the worker’s hands to the press closing motion. A possible unde‐
sirable event (often called a hazardous event) in such a situation is then that the worker
gets his hands caught between the closing dies (the hazardous zone of the machine).
Safety regulations and standards require that such machines be equipped with
protective devices which either prevent entry of the operator in the hazardous zone or
stop the hazardous motion when parts of the worker’s body are in the hazardous zone.
The protective device often utilized with press brake takes the form of a light (laser)
sensor beam which spans the length of the press and is mounted between the two dies.
Such a device is shown in the above picture of a press brake (1 is the sensor beam and
2 refers to the emitting and receiving components of the device).
From this general description, a simple fault tree can be drawn (Fig. 4).
Fig. 4. Fault tree.
In this example, the top event occurs if two events arise. One of these consists of the
worker not withdrawing his hands from between the dies. In practice, such accidents
have occurred due to contributing factors such as, for example, worker fatigue due to
high job repetition leading to loss of concentration, stressful work situations, very noisy
or hot and humid work environment. These factors would appear in the fault tree below
event X2.
The fault tree is indeed dynamic in nature as per our deﬁnition because event X1,
protective device failure, must occur before the bending action by the worker; otherwise
a properly functioning device would stop (safely) the press and no accident then occurs.
The equivalent associated Markov diagram is then (Fig. 5):

where:
P = Probability of failure expressed as a fuzzy term;
𝛍λ1, 𝛍λ2 = fuzzy failure rates of events X1 and X2;
t = time which must be set, i.e. we consider the state of the system after t hours.
We calculated P with the following data:
We shall take t = 50000 h.
Calculation of the probability of occurrence P of the accident requires knowledge
of the failure rates (expressed as fuzzy numbers). Speciﬁcally what is needed are: the
failure rate of the protective device and, the failure rate associated with the human action
consisting in having one’s hands between the press dies while the operator is bending a
part. The ﬁrst data could, in principle be obtained from the manufacturer of the device.
However, in practice, this data may not necessarily exist. In the same manner, the number
of times a press brake operator places his hands between the dies of a press is not a
statistic that is collected by workplaces. So, a another way to obtain the data is through
expert elicitation, that is consulting people knowledgeable with the problem at hand and
470

asking them to estimate, based on their judgement, the probabilities or failure rates that
are sought.
Participants were thus solicited for this purpose. These were eight bending press
operators in a large manufacturing plant. The health and safety coordinator as well as
the workers’ supervisor were also solicited. A structured questionnaire was used in the
elicitation process.
The final aggregated fuzzy estimate of the probabilities is obtained by simply taking the
average of the experts’ estimates for each of the three components of the fuzzy numbers
corresponding to the expert’s linguistic probability estimate, as given in the scale.
With the ﬁnal fuzzy probability estimates then on hand, the top event in the relevant
fault tree is calculated. The fuzzy failure rates are calculated as μ1 = <2.1203, 2.7100,
2.7871> ·10−5 and μ2 = <0.53434, 1.0306, 1.2963> · 10−5.
Inserting those values into Eq. (2), we obtained P = <0.0932, 0.1944, 0.2380> ·10−5.

Conclusion
In this paper, we presented a method for calculating the top event probability of occur‐
rence of a dynamic fuzzy fault tree, a process which can be referred to as a forward
problem. The fault tree models the dynamic aspect of the problem at hand, namely that
the top undesirable event occurs depends on the time sequence in which the initiating
events occur. A Markov diagram was derived which allows the appropriate equations
of state to be written. Solving them then yielded the desired probability.

Abstract. Enhancing the safety and health at work has signiﬁcant economic
importance, as addressing issues related to safety and health to create favourable
work conditions and work relations brings optimization of work process and a
positive economic effect. It also brings reduction of losses, greater productivity,
efﬁciency and quality of work – that means greater prosperity for the company
and the whole society. To ensure the continuous prosperity of the company, it is
important to implement a control mechanism to ensure the proper functioning of
the business entity. There is a general principle that only 15% of problems
should be left to be solved by employees and 85% should be secured by a
management system. As in other areas of business management, also in occu-
pational health and safety, it is necessary to establish an effective management
system. An example is the standard OHSAS 18001:2007, which aims to sys-
tematically limit the occupational risks that may endanger the safety and health
of all persons affected by activities, products or services of the organization. The
aim of the standard is to help organizations manage occupational health and
safety (hereinafter OH&S) risks and improve product quality or services and
organizational performance by preventing injuries and occupational diseases.
This article presents the pilot version of implementation of OH&S management
system in a manufacturing organization where the management decided to adopt
this new structure and implement a project of the preparation of the imple-
mentation according to the requirements of the new standard ISO 45001:2017.

Introduction
With the growing number of many different management systems, the issue of their
successful implementation and continual meeting of the requirements has been
increasingly coming to the foreground. According to [1], there are several factors
supporting effective implementation of systems. On one hand, it is about maturity of an
organization, number of processes; on the other hand, as it is reported [10], involve-
ment of management plays an equally important role. Throughout the history, it is clear

Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing 604, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-60525-8_49

that efforts to introduce the requirements of individual management systems were based
on speciﬁc requirements that were not yet uniﬁed.
In 1989 European Union adopted the Framework Directive no. 89/391/EEC
on implementation of measures to improve OH&S. It represents an important binding
milestone in improving safety and health protection at work and ensures minimum
requirements for safety and health protection throughout Europe. Thus the member
states may maintain those measures or introduce more stringent measures.
It deﬁned precautionary principles, general duties of employers and employees. In
response to it, the implementation non-statutory guidelines were issued to cover the
requirements for the OH&S workers, working conditions focusing on work equipment,
work environment, personal protective equipment, handling of loads, work with dis-
play screens, asbestos, chemicals, etc. The OH&S area was complex; therefore an
effective management system of OH&S was introduced that ensured the safety of
production equipment (e.g. in compliance with the Directive 89/392/EEC on the safety
of machines, now 2006/42/EC) besides the OH&S staff and the interested parties.
The year 1996 can be considered as the beginning of development of the OH&S
management system, in which time the ﬁrst British Standard - BS 8800 in this area was
adopted. The need for individual criteria on health and safety at work resulted in the BS
8800 standard to become a kind of internationally accepted standard as a basis espe-
cially in Europe in the 1990s.
In 1999, this trend led to the adoption of the international document OHSAS 18001,
supplemented with the Implementation Guidelines - OHSAS 18002 in 2000. Even though
this document was not a formal international standard at that time, it was providing
guidance on appropriate procedural and organisational principles of OH&S [3].
In June 2007, the BS OHSAS 18001:2007 standard (British Standard Occupational
Health and Safety Assessment Series) was issued in the UK. This standard replaced the
speciﬁcation of the 1999 – OHSAS 18001:1999 standard and there were a few sig-
niﬁcant changes related to the old standards operated by 80 countries of the world. The
standard applied to prevention, improvement of work health and safety management
system, identiﬁcation of hazards and threats, risk assessment, and determining man-
agement measures, communication and consulting and it has been structured so as to be
compatible with the standards related to the quality management system (QMS) and
Environmental Management System (EMS). Still, it was only a recommended standard,
which was issued as an international ISO standard.
The area of safety has always been perceived differently in various countries,
respectively, health protection has been viewed through a socio-cultural prism. How-
ever, this fact did not discourage the members of ISO from seeking a common concept
of security, which could be deﬁned as a uniﬁed international ISO standard. Therefore,
the OHSAS 18001 standard has been effective for several years now in the review
process to be issued under the name ISO 45001 as a completely new, internationally
renowned standard throughout the world. This standard has already had several
announced releases; however, it has always been postponed due to the comments and
implementation Fig. 1 [9].
The initial issue period was already announced for 2016, but the International
Standards Organisation moved this term with the fact that it released a draft version for
the public, marked as ISO/DIS 45001. The aim of this draft version is to give
Implementation Proposal of OH&S Management System
473

organizations time to become familiar with the new requirements in advance, and thus
prepare them for a smooth transition from the old system to the new occupational
health and safety management. Based on the statistics by ILO, one person dies or 153
people are injured every 15 s in the world as a result of an accident or occupational
disease. Accidents at work represent a heavy burden for organisations and society as a
whole - it is about 2.3 million deaths each year and more than 300 million non-fatal
accidents [4].
This is also one of the reasons why the planned ISO 45001 standard is one of the
most anticipated ISO standards for OH&S. With its arrival, a minimum increase in the
workplace safety standard, as well as reduction in the number of accidents are
expected.

Comparative Study of the OHSAS 18001
and the Upcoming ISO 45001 Standard
In 2012, ISO issued a document marked as Annex SL (Proposals for Management
System Standards). Annex SL - Proposals for management systems standards
according to which all international newly adopted or revised standards shall have a
uniform HLS (High Level Structure) framework based on the Plan - Do - Check
methodology.
The reason for issuing the Annex SL was to seek formal uniﬁcation of all man-
agement systems standards by providing a uniform structure.1 According to Annex SL,
all international standards of management systems shall have a uniform structure in
form of ten chapters:
Introduction
1. Scope
2. Normative References
3. Terms and Deﬁnitions
4. Context of the Organization
5. Leadership
Fig. 1. Historical development of the OHSAS 18001 standard
1 Despite the uniform structure, there are visible formal differences. For example the ISO 9001
standard is marked as the Chapter 5 Leadership. ISO/DIS 45001 refers to the Chapter 5 titled as
Leadership and Worker Participation.
474
A. Nagyova et al.

6. Planning
7. Support
8. Operation
9. Performance Evaluation
10. Continual Improvement
The beneﬁt of HLS structure will be to facilitate the integration of management
systems in the organization. As already mentioned, the Annex SL is based on the
PDCA cycle. Chapters 4–7 are included in the Plan phase, Chapter 8 in the Do phase,
Chapter 9 in the Check phase, and the Chapter 10 in the Act phase [2]. The section
Planning involves Risk Based Thinking, which must be applied in all processes of the
management system.
Like all other management systems standards, the OH&S management system
standard has undergone the HLS application, changes of requirements that did not
occur in the original OHSAS 18001 at all (Fig. 2).
2.1
Major Changes in the Requirements of the ISO/DIS 45001standard
In addition to the introduction of the main system requirements (Table1.), new terms
and deﬁnitions referred to in the standard were formulated within the OH&S man-
agement system standard. These are primarily terms, such as:
Interested party - person or organization that can affect, be affected by, or perceive its
self to be affected by a decision or activity.

4 Context of the organization
4.1 Understanding the
organization and its context
This is a completely new requirement;
the organization will need to determine
the external and internal context that
affects the organization and its OH&S
management system
4.2 Understanding the needs
and expectations of workers
and other interested parties
Interested parties are mentioned several
times in OHSAS 18001, but there were
no explicit requirements for their
identiﬁcation and identiﬁcation of their
needs and expectations. Furthermore,
ISO/DIS 45001 distinguishes workers
from other interested parties in order to
emphasize their importance
4.3 Determining the scope of
the OH&S management system
4.1 General requirements
Both standards require deﬁnition of
OH&S management system scope;
only ISO/DIS 45001 elaborates
requirements for the scope in more
detail. Documenting the scope of the
OH&S management system is required
by both standards. For more
information, see How to determine
scope of the OH&S management
system

require the organization to appoint a
member of the top management to be
responsible for the OH&S management
system

6 Planning
6.1 Actions to address risks and
opportunities
6.1.1 General
This is a completely new requirement
compared to OHSAS 18001. When
planning the OH&S management
system, the organization will need to
determine the risks and opportunities
affecting the organization
6.1.2 Hazard identiﬁcation and
assessment of OH&S risks
4.3.1 Hazard identiﬁcation,
risk assessment and
determining controls
6.1.2.1 Hazard identiﬁcation
The requirements regarding
identiﬁcation and assessment of OH&S
hazards are the same in both standards;
only ISO/DIS 45001 provides more
details
6.1.2.2 Assessment of OH&S
risks and other risks to the
OH&S management system
Risks related to the OH&S
management system are a new
requirement compared to OHSAS
18001; this clause covers not only
hazard-related risks but also risks
regarding legal and other requirements
and overall context of the organization
6.1.2.3 Identiﬁcation of OH&S
opportunities and other
opportunities
Opportunities are only mentioned in
ISO/DIS 45001, and this sub clause
deﬁnes what kind of opportunities must
be addressed
6.1.3 Determination of
applicable legal requirements
and other requirements
4.3.2 Legal and other
requirements
Both standards require the organization
to establish a process for identiﬁcation
of legal and other requirements, and
also to document legal and other
requirements

7.5 Documented information
4.4.4 Documentation
4.4.5 Control of documents
4.5.4 Control of records
Documents and records now belong to

information
8 Operation
8 Operation
4.4 Implementation and

change management and outsourced
processes
8.1.2 Hierarchy of controls
4.3.1 Hazard identiﬁcation,
risk assessment and
determining controls
The hierarchy is much better deﬁned in
ISO/DIS 45001 and slightly modiﬁed.
While OHSAS 18001 puts it inside the
clause with other requirements,
ISO/DIS 45001 has it separately to
emphasize its importance

9.2 Internal audit
4.5.5 Internal audit
The requirements are equivalent, but
the new standard has divided the clause
into two sub clauses to emphasize some
elements of the internal audit, such as
the audit objective and the audit
process. The main difference is that the
new standard does not require a
documented procedure

4.5.3.2 Nonconformity,
corrective action and preventive
action
ISO/DIS 45001 does not have
preventive actions, which aligns it with
new versions of other management
system standards. Also, incident
investigation is merged with
nonconformities and corrective actions
because the same process can be used
for investigation of incidents and
nonconformities, and they are both
resolved with corrective actions

The new standard points out the need to
use all available information for
continually improving the OH&S
management system

Competence - ability to apply knowledge and skills to achieve intended results.
Documented information - information organizations are required to control and
maintain, including the medium on which information is contained.
Top management - person or group of people who direct and control an organization
at the highest level.
Injury and ill health - adverse effect on the physical, mental or cognitive condition of
a person [8].
For explanation and a successful implementation (especially in cases where orga-
nizations have already implemented OH&S management system) it is necessary to
compare the requirements listed in the previous version of a standard with the
upcoming version of standard (Table 1).
Prepared ISO 45001 will replace OHSAS 18001 and current users of OHSAS
18001 will need to update their systems according to the requirements of the new
international health and safety standard within a three-year transition period that will
commence after the standard is published for use [8].
Following from the requirements of ISO/DIS 45001, it is possible to identify
several essential changes, which will have to be applied by organizations.
Summary of key changes [7]:
• Strategic approach to OH&S management
• New Stages in the development of the Management System involving deﬁning the
Structure, Normative Mandatory References, Common Terminology and deﬁning
the Scope before developing the System.
• New stage focussing on the “Context” of the organisation including understanding
the internal and external drivers and assessing the needs of interested parties
• A greater emphasis on the integration of OH&S into the management of the business
• Greater involvement and emphasis on senior management’s leadership commitment
and on internal consultation and representation
• More emphasis on the concept of risk management
• Legal and other requirements to be made more explicit
• Greater focus of need to demonstrate compliance
• Greater emphasis on hierarchy of controls
• Management of change speciﬁcally included
• Outsourcing, contractor management and procurement arrangements to be made
more explicit
• An increased ﬂexibility with the use of documents.

Application of New the Requirements of ISO/DIS 45001
in a Selected Company
The implementation proposal was carried out in an organization with several suc-
cessfully implemented management systems. Its production portfolio is focused pri-
marily on manufacture of speciﬁc materials that are also used in healthcare, and require
a detailed analysis of processes. The organization being provided a transitional period
for its certiﬁed system to comply with the new requirements of the ISO 9001: 2015
standard based on ISO 9001: 2008, the company management decided to implement
the requirements of ISO/DIS 45001 at this time, as they have a common structure
resulting from the HLS structure. In this manner, the organization wants to gain time in
case the issue of ISO 45001 differs from ISO/DIS 45001 in some of the requirements,
and in case it is less challenging to adjust this OH&S management system accordingly.
3.1
The Description of the Selected Company
Ceit Biomechanical Engineering Company (hereinafter CBE) Ltd. was founded in
2010 as a spin-off of the parent company CEIT JSC and the Technical University of
Košice (TUKE). The organization is a certiﬁed manufacturer of customized 3D printed
medical devices. Its main activities are as follows:
• 3D print manufacture of individually customized titanium alloy implants (Ti64),
• treatment and processing of medical data
Fig. 3. Design and application of the implant to a patient
Implementation Proposal of OH&S Management System
481

• manufacture of plastic and metal parts and prototypes made by 3D printing
technology,
• 3D scanning, digitizing, reverse engineering, industrial metrology and diagnostics.
The manufacture of 3D printed implants is currently the core of its business
activities. Around 25 implants, particularly of a cranial character, have been success-
fully implemented so far. The company has successfully designed and implemented a
facial implant (Fig. 2).
As a part of the system security, the CBE organization has implemented three
management systems, namely based on:
ISO 9001: 2008 for processes in the additive manufacturing, scanning and reverse
engineering.
ISO 13485: 2003 for development, production and sale of medical devices.
OHSAS 18001 for digitized data processing and components made by additive
manufacturing technology. Project Management.
3.2
Current Situation Analysis Related to ISO/DIS 45001
With the coming requirements of ISO/DIS 45001, the CBE decided to analyse the
current status of the established OH&S management system in compliance with
OHSAS 18001. The aim was to identify the diversity and propose measures to meet
requirements under ISO/DIS 45001. The analysis was based on the ISO/DIS 45001
requirements structure. Following ﬁndings were identiﬁed there:
Context of the Organization (Chapter 4 of ISO/DIS 45001). CBE has identiﬁed its
customers and suppliers. Identiﬁcation of the other interested parties, including their
requirements and expectations is missing. CBE is focused on 4 major processes:
1. Design and development of the product
2. Additive manufacture

The current OH&S management system covers all processes in CBE. As regards to
the key processes of the Design and Product Development and Additive Manufac-
turing, it is necessary to identify all the interested parties, including their (legislative)
requirements and expectations. These are mainly regulatory authorities such as, Public
Health Authority, Labour Inspectorate, and the like. In relation to OH&S management
system, it mainly applies to institutions and authorities supervising compliance with the
principles of OH&S management system.

Leadership and Working Participation (Chapter 5 of ISO/DIS 45001). CBE with
its current OH&S management system meets the requirements following from ISO/DIS
45001 without further measures.
Planning (Chapter 6 of ISO/DIS 45001). The current OH&S management system
includes identiﬁcation of all the risks associated with the production. The speciﬁed
risks are set out in the “Risk Analysis” document. A risk matrix method (type 5  5) is
used for risk assessment. Based on the risk assessment, it was not necessary to take
measures to minimize them. However, in the context of the new requirements, it will be
necessary to update the risks identiﬁcation and assessment even in relation to the
context of the organization.
Support (Chapter 7 of ISO/DIS 45001). CBE has an elaborated, approved and
publicly known OH&S policy. Its formulation provides a framework for setting OH&S
objectives. The objectives are measurable, with a speciﬁed target date and responsi-
bility. The OH&S policy and the resulting targets are regularly monitored and updated.
In connection with the coming of new the ISO/DIS 45001 requirements, it will be
necessary to update both documents.
Operation (Chapter 8 of ISO/DIS 45001). CBE has to constantly monitor legal
requirements of regulatory authorities and thus adapt the conditions of its processes.
CBE has developed a procedure called “Trauma Plan”. By its content, it complies with
the requirements of ISO/DIS 45001 related to emergency preparedness.
Performance Evaluation (Chapter 9 ISO/DIS 45001). The CBE management peri-
odically review the existing OH&S management system and ensures internal audits
realization. Under the new requirements of ISO/DIS 45001, CBE will have to modify
the content of management reviews, auditing process, and to focus on the new
requirements under the Chapter 4, 6, or 10.
Continual Improvement (Chapter 10 ISO/DIS 45001). Preventive action (i.e. pre-
ventive measures) has been deleted from the requirements of ISO/DIS 45001. How-
ever, they have become a part of the Risk-Based Thinking (requirements in the chapter
6). The current customary precautions will become a part of risk management in the
light of new requirements on the OH&S management system. With the risks identiﬁed
as high, CBE will have to take (preventive) measures to minimize them. Measures
resulting from remedial action do not change in the light of new requirements.
3.3
The Changes in Relation to the Requirements of ISO/DIS 45001
Based on the current status analysis done at CBE following from the ISO/DIS 45001
requirements, the following adjustments to the current OH&S management system
were summarized (Fig. 3).

Conclusion
With the planned ISO 45001 standard, organizations will be expected to amend the
existing certiﬁed OH&S management system. The aim of the paper was to show the
actual amendments of the existing certiﬁed OH&S management system in the orga-
nization. The output of this article is to draft changes to be made for meeting the
requirements of the upcoming ISO 45001 standard. CBE took this provisional step in
order to shorten the transformation period of its management system when the
requirements of ISO 45001 are ﬁnally released.

Abstract. Safe use of plants, equipment and moving machineries on con-
struction sites are complex and delicate and these are determined by the
immense number of brands and types of moving equipment options. Continu-
ously Ghanaian operators get injured and even killed in plant associated accident
in the construction industry. This is due to lack of occupational health and safety
education to both the employer and their operatives. The construction industry is
faced with problems of cost reduction, as accidents add to the cost of the
construction, thereby reducing proﬁt margins. The aim of this study is to
investigate the safe use of plants on construction site. The objectives are to
identify the causes of plant accidents on construction sites and to determine the
level of enforcement of safety laws and rules. The study was conducted on
ﬁnding out the problems associated with the safety of operators on construction
sites in some selected sites in Central Region of Ghana. Convenient sampling
technique method was used to select three DlKl construction companies and
ﬁfteen (15) operatives and three health and safety ofﬁcers were selected. The
research instrument that was used includes questionnaires, personal interviews
and observations. The data was analyzed using the descriptive statistics that
comprises mean and tables. The ﬁndings revealed that respondents with a mean
score of 3.5 conﬁrmed that competent persons are used to carry out the erection,
dismantling and height alternation of tower cranes. However inadequate training
and fatigue of operators are one of the main reasons causing unsafe practices of
tower crane operations.

Introduction
[9] alluded that over 70% of industrial and construction site accidents are due to unsafe
acts by operators of the machineries at those sites. Construction works are mostly
dangerous and risky thus making safety and health care issues very important [20]. Due
to the fact that accident rates in construction are high when compared to other

industries, the construction and projects managers need to be fully prepared to deal
with accidents when they occur. Accident statistics represent not only terrible human
tragedies but also substantial economic lost. This is because accidents cause damage to
plant equipment and the loss of productive work time until the normal site working
rhythm and morale are restored. Accidents can also cause work disruption and reduce
the work rate drastically [7].
The major causes of accidents are related to the unique nature of the industry,
human behavior, difﬁcult work site conditions, and poor safety management, which
result in unsafe work methods, equipment and procedures. Emphasis needs to be placed
on training and the utilization of comprehensive safety programs [8].
Plants, materials and manpower are the core resources on which all operations in
the construction industry are successfully executed. This gives the indication that the
absence of one part shall cause problems such as delay in operation, poor work
amongst others. Plants usage therefore is of great beneﬁt to the execution of every
construction process. Transportation plants such as; cranes, chutes, vans, lorries, hoists
and fork lifts have sped up construction works over the years by transporting materials
from one place to the other in various directions. Excavation plants such as: bulldozers,
skimmers, face shovels amongst others have provided builders the speed they needed to
execute works in the shortest possible time.
1.1
Problem Statement
[2] reported that a man in his 30s died on the spot when a crane he and others were
operating collapsed, at La, in Accra. The heavy weight lifting device mutilated the
body of the operator, who was standing beneath the device when it collapsed. The
other worker who survived the accident has been left traumatized. The crane, used in
the construction of high rise buildings was being worked on when the accident
occurred.
In 2002 two overhead cranes crashed on the ground killing an operator instantly.
According to sources the two cranes were performing the normal lifting of heavy iron
when they crashed to the ground [3].
Crane accidents [6] reported that A tower crane jib came crashing down onto
abuilding it was working on in Charlotte Street, London. It is believed that that the
crane lost its counterweight, although that has not been conﬁrmed. The jib bent and
dropped onto the facade of the building with the hook block landing on the bed of a
delivery truck while the jib tip access platform was left dangling above the street.
In 2015 crane accidents recorded that seven men were killed in the Bihar region of
India, after the boom of a small crawler crane came down on them.
A smaller barge carrying sand had apparently sunk and the crane was attempting to
help when the boom lufﬁng cables failed. The crane was clearly not in good working
condition and had been the subject of complaints about its state [5].

Aim
The aim of this study is to investigate into the safety of cranes and their operators on
construction sites.
1.3
Objectives of the Study
1. To identify the causes of crane-associated accidents on site.
2. To recommend the safety measures to be put in place to ensure crane accident-free
policy.
1.4
Signiﬁcance of the Study
The ﬁndings will promote safety awareness among crane operators and other con-
struction workers on ensuring health and safety issue in the use of crane in Ghana.

Literature Review
Tower-crane work constitutes a critical component in the range of elements that make
the work environment of construction sites essentially hazardous [12, 15].
The use of tower cranes, however, have their own safety problems as well; with the
large-area work envelopes of tower cranes that commonly cover the entire site and the
crane that often oversails beyond site boundaries, these safety problems have a major
bearing on the overall work safety on site.
2.1
Operator
A crane operator is someone who uses the crane to transport various objects. There are
many different types, makes, models and sizes of cranes, such as mobile cranes, tower
cranes, boom trucks and self-erect tower cranes. Mobile cranes are used to do work a
boom truck can’t do – higher lifts, heavier loads, and lifts that need a longer reach.
[10] outlined the following duties of crane operators:
• Control equipment with levers, wheels, or foot pedals
• Move material according to a plan or schedule they receive from their superiors
• Set up and inspect material moving equipment
• Make minor repairs to their equipment
• Record the materials they have moved and where they moved them from and to
In warehouse environments, most crane operators use forklifts and conveyor belts.
Automated sensors and tags are increasingly used to keep track of merchandise,
allowing operators to work faster. In warehouses, operators usually work closely with
hand material movers.

Many crane operators work for underground and surface mining companies as well.
They help to dig or expose the mine, remove the earth and rock, and extract the ore and
other mined materials. In construction, crane operators remove earth to clear space for
buildings. Some work on a building site for the entire length of the construction project.
For example, operators often help to construct high-rise buildings by transporting
materials to workers far above ground level [16].
2.2
Slinger Signaller
The job of a slinger signaller is one of the most important jobs on a building site. It
requires skill, diligence, and concentration, working alongside the lifting teams to
provide safe direction and supervision to the crane operators.
The slinger signaller normally acts as the eyes and ears of the crane operator, who is
likely to have an obstructed view of their surroundings. This obstructed view increases
the risks involved with loading, lifting and generally operating the crane and so they
need the slinger signaller to communicate via a series of hand signals to assist with
maneuvers.
Their main responsibility is to ensure the safety of the operators, and any other
workers or site visitors that could be at risk.
The standard hand signals used by slinger signallers are detailed in the Health and
Safety Signs and Signals Regulations 1996, L64. They must be:
• Precise
• Clear
• Easy to make
• Easy to understand
In some situations these hand signals are not sufﬁcient to maintain a safe working
environment and more signals will need to be used. If this happens, the signaller must
only use signals that have been pre-arranged with the operator (Health Safety Training,
2015).
2.3
Factors Affecting Safety in Tower Crane Operations
Negligence or Misjudgment of Participants in Tower Crane Operations. Most of the
fatalities are due to carelessness, such as working too close to energized power lines,
improper rigging, or lifting loads exceeding weight capacities of cranes [4, 14].
Inadequate Training. Workers who do not have sufﬁcient training or knowledge
about their jobs should not be expected to identify all unsafe conditions surrounding
their work [1, 13]. Lack of safety training and formal education are signiﬁcant risk
factors for accidents [21, 20].
Sub-contracting Practices in Tower Crane Operation. Most construction contractors
do not own and operate their tower cranes rather they rent them and operate them by
in-house or contracted personnel [12]. According to [19] Multi-layered sub-contracting
Assessing the Safety Use of Tower Cranes on Construction Sites
489

in tower crane operations bring salaries down for crane operators, resulting in chronic
long working hours and mobility of crane operators which directly inﬂuences con-
struction safety.
Pressure from Deadlines. A tight construction schedule is the most signiﬁcant factor
that hinders the implementation of construction site safety [11]. [19] noted that a job
behind schedule can create an atmosphere of tension, tending to force people to work
usually faster than normal, thus compromising safety. This gives rise to risks to the
cranes, to nearby objects, to the rigging crew and to workers in the vicinity [14].
2.4
General Provisions in Using Tower Crane
According to [10] some of the general provisions in using tower cranes are stated as
follows: The characteristics of the various machines available should be considered
against the operating requirements and the surroundings in which the crane will operate
before a particular type of crane is selected. Care should be taken in the assessment of
wind loads both during operations and out of service. Account should also be taken of the
effects of high structures on wind forces in the vicinity of the crane. The ground on which
the tower crane stands should have adequate bearing capacity. Account should be taken
of seasonal variations in ground conditions. Bases for tower cranes and tracks for
rail-mounted tower cranes should be ﬁrm and level. Tower cranes should only operate on
gradients within limits speciﬁed by the manufacturer. Tower cranes should only be
erected at a safe distance from excavations and ditches. Tower cranes should be sited
where there is clear space available for erection, operation and dismantling. As far as
possible, cranes should be sited so that loads do not have to be handled over occupied
premises, over public thoroughfares, other construction works and railways or near
power cables. Where two or more tower cranes are sited in positions where their jibs
could touch any part of the other crane, there should be direct means of communication
between them and a distinct warning system operated from the cab so that one driver may
alert the other to impending danger. When the tower crane is left unattended, loads
should be removed from the hook, the hook raised, the power switched off and the boom
brought to the horizontal. For longer periods or at times when adverse weather conditions
are expected, out of service procedures should be followed. The main jib should be
slewed to the side of the tower away from the wind, put into free slew and the crane
immobilized. Devices should be provided to prevent loads being moved to a point where
the corresponding safe working load of the crane would be exceeded. Name boards or
other items liable to catch the wind should not be mounted on a tower crane other than in
accordance with the manufacturers’ instructions.

Research Methodology
Convenient sampling technique was used to select ﬁve DlKl construction companies
and twenty (20) respondents comprising (5) operatives; (5) slinger signalers; (5) health
and safety ofﬁcers and (5) contractors were selected. The research instrument used
includes questionnaires, personal interviews and observations. A ﬁve-point Likert scale
490
E. Bamfo-Agyei and L. Atepor

was adopted in the questionnaire. The questionnaires were sent to construction per-
sonnel who are handling tower crane related operations, including crane operators,
slinger signalers, safety ofﬁcers and contractors. The data was analyzed using the
descriptive statistics that comprises mean and tables (Table 1).
4
Findings and Discussion
Table 2 reveals that most of the respondents were able to identify crane operators, having
a mean score of 4.35. The respondents revealed that crane operators often work without a
clear and unrestricted view of load carried, point of loading and vicinity of cranes. This
highlights a rise in danger of tower crane operations with a mean score of 1.65.
All respondents agreed that they are capable of handling slinging works of tower
crane operations on hearing, eyesight and reﬂexes, and they are agile and have the
physical strength to handle lifting works.
[19] concluded that An effective communication between crane operators and other
personnel is essential for safe crane operations. Failure to implement an effective
communication between crane operators and other personnel will lead to unsafe crane
operations, and may contribute to injuries to people from dropped loads and collision
with other plants and structures. Radio/tele-communication signals and hand signals are
the major communication methods between crane operators and other personnel.
Table 3 one observes that a greater number of the respondents having a men score
of 4.25 fully understand procedures of erecting and dismantling tower cranes and
alternating height of tower cranes however most of the respondents indicated that the
erection and dismantling of tower cranes and alternate height of tower cranes in
compliance with manufacturers’ instructions in such procedures are not followed
giving a mean score of 2.85. Also most of the respondents acknowledge that before the
erection, dismantling and height alternation operations, a competent examiner carries
out test or examination meanwhile after the erection, dismantling and height alternation
operations, a competent examiner do not always carry out test or examination. The
respondents indicated that they have not been provided formal training by their
employers. They normally exercise their skills via on-job training.

Usually it is common to employ sub-contractors to provide services with operatives
and tools for erecting, dismantling and alternating height tower cranes. It is because
most main contractors do not have their own tower cranes. They may not have workers
who are familiar with the required procedures. The use of sub-contractors for the
erection, dismantle and height alternation of tower crane operations may do not also
help in the provision of training related to tower crane operations.
The respondents with a mean score of 3.5 noted that competent persons are used to
carry out the erection, dismantling and height alternation of tower cranes. Most of the
respondents agreed that for the erection, dismantling and height alternation operations,
a roped-off area is provided which has been clear of other personnel who are not
involved; it had mean score of 3.2.

Procedures and Precautions for Tower Crane Operations. From Table 4: a greater
number of the respondents with a mean score of 3.90 noted that at the beginning of
each shift or working day, competent operators or competent persons carry out routine
checks, however a check list is not used in each routine check and inspection this had a
mean score of 2.70. [19] admitted that preventive maintenance can effectively eliminate
accidents caused by defective parts of tower cranes. Routine checks and thorough
inspection are precedent to preventive maintenance. Therefore, inspection is one of the
key precautions to prevent tower crane accidents. However, sometimes, tower cranes
are rush to move to another sites, some tower crane providers or owners may omit
checking and maintenance of tower cranes. According to the respondents, tower crane
components, such as slings, hooks and masts have been periodically checked and tested
by competent examiners.

Conclusion
The ﬁrms the researcher visited do organize, train and educate their operatives on
health and safety programs, but the operatives do not put into practice the knowledge
acquired from the health and safety programs organized for them. The ﬁrms have safety
ofﬁcers to educate operatives on the risk involved in their work and also to show
commitment to the implementation of the safety but the ofﬁcers are not punctual. The
ﬁrms were not linked to any medical personnel, clinic or hospital in case of injuries
sustained.
Blind lift is the major cause for crane-associated accidents followed by obstacles
and congested site, power lines, cab ergonomics, sight distance and angel, and over-
lapping cranes. Almost all the crane operators get so excited when performing lifting’s,
they therefore lift before considering the exact location in most cases hence exposing
both the operators and the employees in the area of operation to safety hazards and
probable crane associated accidents on the sites. The measure put in place in order to
maintain and improve the safety of cranes operator is to implement Safety policies. But
though the ﬁrms have safety policies, they were not effective.
5.1
Recommendation
These recommendations are based on the ﬁndings and conclusion drawn in the study.
The ﬁrms should make sure they organize, train and educate operators the need to
execute their task ensuring accident free activity. The training for different duties in
tower crane operations should be strengthened, particular in rigging operations as well
as erecting, dismantling, climbing and alternating height of tower cranes. In addition,
Table 4. Procedures and precautions for tower crane operations
494
E. Bamfo-Agyei and L. Atepor

training for new entrants in the ﬁeld should be strengthened. The ﬁrms should put
measures in place in other to ensure the operators of the crane carry out lifting’s as
required of them as professionals. The ﬁrms should make it a point that their policies
are implemented and working effectively, and also the entire operatives on the site are
aware with the safety policies of the ﬁrms and it should be written in a clear and simple
language so that it is easily understood.
It can consider expanding certiﬁcation mechanism from crane operators to other
relevant parties in tower crane operations, such as erectors, signalers, foremen and
coordinators.
Proper checks, inspections and examination of tower crane should be carried out by
a recognize company mandated in ensuring standard. The companies should make sure
they provide enough safety equipment’s to the employees and also set a site safety
committee to make adequate supervision on the employees in wearing and using the
safety equipment when it is due to be used for works.
It is well known fact that, the promotion of safety in the construction industry plays
a vital role in providing a guide to employers and the government as well.

Abstract. With the rapid development of computer technology and information
control theory, information systems become more complex and intelligent. Trans‐
portation hub monitoring system, nuclear power control system, environmental
monitoring system, and other large systems have evolved from the traditional
control mode to digital control mode. Because digital information interaction
interfaces are characterized by the large quantity of information and complicated
information relationships, operators may enter the complex cognition and lead to
task failures and even serious system failures or major accidents due to operators’
slipping, misreading, misjudgment, late feedback, and other cognitive diﬃculties.
It is urgent to obtain the rational design way of dynamic and digital information
in the interaction interface. This paper aims to analyze interaction mechanism
between error and cognition and explore the physiological reaction mechanism
for error factors of information interaction interface during the visual cognition
from the perspective of the cause of task failures, error factors. The project results
can provide theoretical supports for the rational design of digital information
interface and guarantee the full performance and accurate implementation of large
systems.

Introduction
With the rapid developments of computer technology and information technology,
human-machine interfaces of great intelligent manufacture equipment, nuclear power
plants, even aircrafts, ships, battleﬁeld command systems, and other digital information
systems have evolved from the traditional control mode to digital control mode with
information interaction interface. Compared with the conventional analog control which
is generally monitoring and operating system, digital control shifts the role of operators
from manual controlers to regulators and decision-makers, which increases the process
of operator’s visual cognition and needs a set of cognitive behaviors perform the task
(as shown in Fig. 1). Because digital information interaction interfaces are characterized

by the large quantity of information and complex information relationships, an operator
may enter the complex cognition and lead to task failure, even serious system failures
and major accidents due to operation errors, misreading, misjudgment, late feedback,
and other cognitive diﬃculties.

Information interface is the major resource for operators to learn about the tasks,
which as well as threat and security state information. Operators must grasp distinct,
real and complete information of combat situation, so that to have the initiative to the
battleﬁeld in hands. Thus, it is clear that the display of information about the interaction
system is extremely signiﬁcant. The information display regarding to automatic combat
identiﬁcation system has been studied [1]. This paper discussed how these two groups
of forms, uniforms and helmets, be presented to conduct the identiﬁcation of combat
information as well as the information analysis with combination of information relia‐
bility. After obtaining the reliable simulated data, there was found that the display
formats of mesh chart and integrated data are more adaptive for combat information
identiﬁcation. The researchers have studied the identiﬁcation performances of the colors,
positions and shapes of diﬀerent symbols and texts, and have obtained a series of
valuable results [2–4]. The layout design of ﬁghter radar situation-interface has been
evaluated experimentally and has been analyzed through an objective evaluation tech‐
nology of eye’s tracker [5, 6]. They also have selected a special scheme of rational layout
optimization through the evaluation by eye’s moving data indexes. The researchers
simulated the general operation sequence of enemy attack task in avionics system to
conduct interface design [7]. The researchers have studied the inﬂuence of complex
digital interfaces on color and shape codes to explore the identiﬁcation performances
under diﬀerent time pressures [9].
Currently, few people in the ﬁeld of visual information interface have started
researches in the base of error factors, especially applied to aviation, military and other
complex systems which are displayed by multilevel subsystems, whose error factors are
concentrated in visual information display of executive monitoring, search and other
tasks and its cognition mechanism of errors is an important hitting-point for improving
interface design as well as the key for reducing cognition diﬃculties. Wu [8, 10, 11],
proposed a new interface design method by introducing error factors and established the
error-cognition stratiﬁcation model for digital information task interfaces.

Objective
Digital information task interface is characterized by transforming systematic abstract
information into user interfacial elements which are easy to identify and understand.
Graphical user interface conveys several elements, including character, text, image,
icon, colour, dimension, and so on. When the information displayed is complex, only
the reasonable navigation design and structure design of information hierarchy can reach
the rationality of information interaction. Thus, the design problem of information inter‐
action interface has evolved into a hot spot and focus problem which was concerned
mutually by researchers in human-factors engineering, automatic control, cognitive
psychology, systematic science, design science and other disciplines. Then, whether the
design factors of information interaction interface could begin with the source of task
failures– error factors? The key point lies in how to understand correctly the interaction
mechanism between ‘error and cognitive’, then, can we propose a reasonable design
strategy for the optimization of visual information interface.

Method
This paper studies error factors of information interface in human-computer interaction
based on visual cognition theory. A feasible error-cognition model is established to solve
some design problems which result in serious failures in information recognition and
analysis, and even in operation and execution processes. Nielsen [12] and Shryane [13]
proposed the availability interface design method to reduce human error probability
(HEP). Yoshikawa [14] studied human error probability (HEP) through user evaluation
model. And Krokos and Baker [15] also proposed interface cognition error classiﬁcation
method. Maxion [16] improved operation interface dependability through mitigation of
human error (External Subgoal Support). Based on Rasmussen, Norman, Reason and
other error types as well as the HERA and CREAM failure identiﬁcation models, we
performed classiﬁcation and cognitive characterization for error factors according to
information search, information recognition, information identiﬁcation, information
selection and judgment as well as the decision-making process and obtained the compre‐
hensive error-cognition model for digital information interface. Based on the behavioral
data and the physiological data derived from eye movement tracking, the misperception
factors leading to users’ information omission/misjudgment are detected.

Operator’s Cognitive Behavior Model
As shown in Fig. 2, based on the information central processing of interaction task
interface, forming the cognitive process from information input to information feedback.
During the process, we need to analyze the operator’s cognitive behaviors based on the
execution of the task. Information search, information recognition, information identi‐
ﬁcation, information selection and judgment as well as the decision-making process are

just operator’s cognitive behaviors of information observation, explanation, planning
and execution during the process of executing the task. Thus, this paper will continue
to explore the information process of complex interaction task interface in depth.

4.2
Analytical Model of Cognitive Error Recognition
We can combine extended operator’s cognitive behavior model with corresponding
analytical model of error recognition, and further recognize the cognitive error of the
interfacial task. Embrey, Altman, and Swain, et al. tried to use the basic behaviour
component of the operator to describe the behavior of the operator with “error” event
characteristics from the view of traditional human factors; PHEA and HRMS et al.
established the analysis model of human factor from the perspective of cognitive
psychology. The technology of HERA proposed by Kirwan [17], which integrates
several methods and enables the analysis results to be tested each other, is reliable rela‐
tively. Thus, this paper will apply error recognition framework to analyze the cognitive
error recognition of information search, recognition, judgment and selection, as well as
decision-making. According to the process of operator’s cognitive behavior, operator’s
task (as shown in Fig. 3), task function as well as task steps and structure are unfolded,
corresponding with the analytical opinion of human reliability, which includes task
analysis, objection analysis, operation analysis, planning analysis, error analysis,
psychological error mechanism analysis, performance shaping factor analysis as well
as human error identiﬁcation in systems tool analysis.

Error Recognition Analytical Model
Error factors in cognitive behavior process are implicit, and manifest as explicit behavior
errors, such as incorrect execution and selection, so what left to be resolved is cognitive
analysis of implicit error factors. To further characterize the error factors of information
interface, according to the interfacial task in complex system environment, operator need
perform ﬁve following cognitive behaviors: search, recognition, identiﬁcation, judg‐
ment and selection, decision-making. Keep the information display format of diﬀerent
task corresponding with cognitive behavior or possible error factors, then, we can char‐
acterize the errors. As shown Fig. 4, it aims to analyze interaction mechanism between
error and cognition and explore the physiological reaction mechanism for error factors
of information interaction interface

Eye-Tracking Experimental Model
In order to analyze diﬀerent information features in a information interaction interface,
such as information layout, information display, task type and potential problems in
information extraction, the experimental paradigm of feature analysis and eye tracking
technology are applied to study the factors involved during visual searches for infor‐
mation. The experiment focuses on the attention processing feature of human eyes when
searching for information, based on the condition that the task monitoring interface
displays digital information features. It is designed to check if there is any diﬀerence in
eye movement indexes for diﬀerent tasks and information areas, and to explore the
relative diﬀerences between diﬀerent searches in diﬀerent information areas, as shown
in Fig. 5.
Fig. 5. Error recognition analytical model of operator’s cognitive behavior
As shown in Fig. 6, ﬁrstly, extract the error factors of visual interface design factors
to be analyzed; Then, select relevant cognitive model (theory) and psychological exper‐
imental paradigm and apply the error factors as independent variables to design the
experiment; Lastly, employ the method combining reaction time and eye tracking to
carry out the experiment.

5.1
Experiment Design
The paper simulated the radar situation-interface of complex system. The nested cogni‐
tive experiment of reaction time and eye movement tracking was conducted. The experi‐
ment 1 focuses on the attention processing feature of human eyes when searching for
information, based on the condition that the task monitoring interface displays complex
information features. It is designed to check if there is any diﬀerence in eye movement
indexes for diﬀerent tasks and information areas, and to explore the relative diﬀerences
between diﬀerent searches in diﬀerent information areas. This experiment uses a real
task monitoring interface as the visual search material for eye tracking, and displays the
same information interface when subjects are undergoing diﬀerent tasks. This experi‐
ment was conducted by adopting two-factor (4 tasks × 9 areas) within the experiment
design. Speciﬁcally, the tasks are divided into task 1, task 2, task 3 and an independent
variable for where no task is set for the subject, based on the main tasks of an operator
of the monitoring process.
The experiment 2 factors causing error problems like information omission and
misjudgment in the radar situation interface are analyzed. Based on the behavioral data
and the physiological data derived from eye movement tracking, the misperception
factors leading to users’ information omission/misjudgment are detected.
5.2
Experiment Results and Discussion
Eye movement data indexes in nine areas of the task monitoring interface have been
analyzed for each task based on a division of the diﬀerent task monitoring areas. The
experiment 1 demonstrate that the search path followed by subjects on the task moni‐
toring interface show signiﬁcantly diﬀerent subject reaction times and eye movements
when undergoing each diﬀerent task, as the search path is inﬂuenced by task-driven
cognitive information processing and information search time. Fixation duration,

duration count and visit count also show signiﬁcant diﬀerences in each diﬀerent monitor
area; therefore information features distributed in the radar sub-interface can be easily
captured, which have been proven to be related to task-driven automatic capture. Infor‐
mation position and features such as colors, shapes and sizes have a signiﬁcant impact
on visual searches as they can easily cause problems with information omission,
misreading and misjudgment, missing/ignoring data etc. when undergoing each diﬀerent
task (as shown Fig. 7). The paper concludes that monitoring tasks and the individual
information features within in an interface have a great inﬂuence on the visual search,
which will guide further research on design of information features in task monitoring
interfaces.
Fig. 7. Visit counts in diﬀerence monitor area
(ANOVA of the monitor area when undergoing diﬀerent tasks indicates that the main
eﬀect of monitor areas (F = 9.033, P = 0.004, p < 0.01) reaches a statistically signiﬁcant
level).
The experiment 2 results showed that, (1) Both interval size and vision position
impose a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the visual cognition of target search. The interval
should not be too large for target search in the situation interface, otherwise it may result
in long reaction time and omission and misjudgment. (2) During the target search in the
upper vision, lower vision and peripheral vision, the reaction time and the error rate
present signiﬁcant changes, and the reaction time of peripheral vision achieves the
longest. The vision position also exerts a remarkable inﬂuence on the ﬁrst saccade
latency. The ﬁxation duration and ﬁxation point number display obvious changes, and
the mean ﬁxation duration of the lower vision is the longest while its ﬁxation point
number is the smallest, which is apt to cause misjudgment and omission of information.
The variance analysis on reaction times showed that, the main eﬀect of intervals of upper

visual positions (F = 14.416, P = 0.012, p < 0.05) and that of peripheral visual positions
(F = 6.990, P = 0.00103, p < 0.05) both reached remarkable levels. The variance analysis
on error rates showed that, the main eﬀect of intervals of upper visual positions
(F = 2.380, P = 0.013, p < 0.05) and that of peripheral visual positions (F = 9.308,
P = 0.014, p < 0.05) reached remarkable levels. (3) Eye movement plots can eﬀectively
reﬂect the process of information search, and the gaze plot and the heat point map can
present the relevant factors of information omission. And the conclusion reached can
be used as reference for the information design and layout of the situation interface of
future complex system, so as to eﬀectively improve the misperception problems like
omission and misjudgment in the target search process.

action interface during visual cognition from the perspective of the cause of task

Abstract. This paper reports results of a study dealing with the ergonomic design
quality of the alarm system and alarm management in 15 process control systems
from diﬀerent sectors of industrial production. Based on available guidelines and
ergonomic evidence, a checklist was designed and applied to these systems to test
for compliance with these guidelines. The results show that there is a great deal
of non-compliance with the requirements, leading to severe impairments of
process safety. The main areas of design deﬁciencies have been found in the lack
of prioritization of alarms, a lack of action guides in the presentation of alarms,
lack of continuous improvement of the alarm system, a lack of systematic training
concepts and training of alarm handling. Feeding back the results to the companies
involved clearly showed that they were looking for help in dealing with these
problems.

Introduction
Investigations into incidents, e.g. in the nuclear power plant Three Mile Island (Harris‐
burg, 1979), in the Texaco (Milford Haven, 1994) or BP (Texas City, 2005) reﬁneries,
as well as on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig (Gulf of Mexico, 2010), demonstrate the
impact that inappropriate design and management of alarm systems can have for
employees, companies, the environment and the public. The investigation reports indi‐
cate that – in addition to technical and organizational deﬁciencies – poorly designed and
managed alarm systems were jointly and to a substantial amount responsible for these
events and their serious consequences. High alarm rates, poor prioritization of alarms,
non-ergonomic and inappropriate design of displays, non-response of alarms and the
lack of systematic training and training concepts for control room operators in dealing
with critical situations were named, among others, as – at least contributing – causes
[e.g. 1–3].

Based on lessons learnt from such experiences in the field (best practice) but also on
research into safety and human factors, over the past decades, a series of international and
national standards and guidelines with recommendations for an ergonomic design of alarm
systems and alarm management have been developed [e.g. 4–8] and numerous publica‐
tions with relevant findings and recommendations have been published [e.g. 9–11].
However, it is unclear to what extent these design requirements and recommenda‐
tions have been implemented into operational practice in diﬀerent branches of process
industries, at least in Germany. Therefore, a research project has been conducted to
address the following questions:
1. How can the ergonomic design quality of alarm systems and alarm management be
easily, consistently and reliably assessed? [not dealt with in this paper]
2. What is the current quality of the design of alarm systems in industrial control rooms
from an ergonomic point of view?
3. What are important ergonomic recommendations to further improve existing and
future alarm systems and alarm management?
This paper will concentrate on design aspects, while another paper by these authors
[12] concentrates on the methodological aspects of these problems.

Method
2.1
Checklist Development
For the intended purpose of the present project, a computerized checklist based on a
feasibility study [13, 14] has been further developed in order
1. to analyze and evaluate the design quality of alarm systems and alarm management
in diﬀerent control rooms and within various sectors of industry,
2. to gain some insight into the implementation of design requirements in this ﬁeld and
3. to derive hints for potential improvements or needs for action in implementing
(normative) design requirements and recommendations where appropriate.
Based on design requirements extracted from relevant literature, guidelines and
normative provisions [e.g. 2, 5–8, 15, 16] an extended knowledge base has been accu‐
mulated, in which the recommendations were collated, summarized and structured into
thematic areas, such as design of alarm systems (e.g. prioritization), design of operator
adapted requirements (e.g. operator performance limits) and design of alarm manage‐
ment (e.g. performance monitoring and improvements).
A sample of prominent, relevant and substantially important characteristics from the
knowledge base was selected by expert reviewers in a multi-staged process, transferred
into questions which were supplemented by examples and notes. A complete evaluation
of all potentially relevant characteristics for an alarm system is not possible due to tech‐
nical, temporal and ﬁnancial reasons.
Answer categories used in the checklist were either pass/fail decisions (yes/no) or –
as in most cases – decisions for traﬃc light categories, with ‘Green’ representing good
design condition, requirements completely fulﬁlled, ‘Yellow’ standing for basically OK,
508
M. Bockelmann et al.

but better solutions would be conceivable, while ‘Red’ representing an unsatisfactory
design solution, asking for improvement.
The computer-based checklist was implemented as an oﬄine version using a portable
computer and an online version provided by a browser via internet. The computerized
version of the checklist oﬀers a number of advantages, such as (1) incorporation of jump
functions in order to provide the assessor with only those questions that are relevant to
the system to be assessed, (2) all questions were deﬁned as mandatory questions, so that
no question remains unanswered, (3) hyperlinks for explaining terms and concepts can
be integrated, (4) raters’ comments are easily readable and (5) the data is immediately
available after completion of the assessment in a form that allows a direct import into
common statistics programs, to name but a few.
2.2
Checklist Suitability
The checklist was tested in a multi-step procedure. As a ﬁrst step, the draft version of
the checklist was reviewed by experts in ergonomics and human factors for its suitability
for the intended purpose, resulting in a ﬁnal draft version with several modiﬁcations,
for instance items were added, modiﬁed by rephrasing of questions and explanations or
supplementing examples or deleted.
Afterwards, this ﬁnal draft of the checklist was tested for usability in operational use
by a senior member of staﬀ from a chemical company and by two human factors and
ergonomics experts (HF/E experts). The company expert was asked to go through the
checklist, read all the items of the checklist (including explanations and examples) care‐
fully and write comments if something was unclear, ambiguous, diﬃcult to understand
etc. The two HF/E experts were asked to apply the checklist to an alarm system and
alarm management in a typical control room within the chemical industry under realistic
operation and investigation conditions and comment needs for amendments regarding
structure, content and checklist design.
The comments or suggestions made by both parties and the experience gained from
these two checks were appraised and subsequently discussed by the above mentioned
expert group, which resulted in a ﬁnal adjustment of the checklist.
The ﬁnal version of the checklist for the present study contains 148 items, arranged
in the following design areas:
1. Alarm generation/alerting
2. Alarm presentation
3. Alarm prioritization
4. Alarm system functionalities and technical measures
5. Consideration of operator performance limits
6. Action guidelines and system interactions
7. Control and feedback
8. Alarm culture and alarm philosophy
9. Continuous improvement
10. Documentation
11. Training

2.3
Checklist Application
The ﬁnal version of the checklist was applied within 14 control rooms at 12 medium-
sized or large companies throughout Germany, where 15 systems (including the alarm
management) were analyzed in detail. Participating companies were from three indus‐
trial sectors: electrical power generation and distribution, chemical industry and food
industry; but mainly from the ﬁrst two sectors. The assessed systems were from eight
diﬀerent manufacturers for process control engineering. These process control systems
were implemented between the 1980s and 2014/15, almost all of them were (regularly)
updated.
Each system was evaluated with the aid of the checklist by two HF/E experts at least
and – where possible – by one or two experienced practitioners from the company such
as technicians, system engineers, safety experts etc. This study design, for example,
allows a comparison between individual assessors and assessor groups [12].
Observation, visual inspection, interviews with control room operators and super‐
visors, physical measurements and document analyses were used as methods of data
collection.
The HF/E experts conducted their assessments independently on two separate days.
Every assessment lasted between 7 and 10 h per working place, varied according to the
complexity of the process under control, the process control system under investigation,
the type and extent of the alarm management activities and the events speciﬁc to the
days of assessment and usually a part of a second shift was included. In contrast to the
HF/E experts, the experienced practitioners did not have to carry out their assessment
on one day. They could save their results at any time and complete the checklist at a
later date. Therefore, no information is available about the time required for investiga‐
tions carried out by the engineering staﬀ.
Investigations have been completed by the HF/E experts, but are still ongoing as
regards the experienced practitioners from the participating companies. In particular, 30
assessments done by the two HF/E experts and 22 assessments done by experienced
practitioners are available at present, i.e. eight ratings by practitioners are still missing.
Thus, only results by HF/E experts will be reported in this paper.

Statistical Analysis
Only a ﬁrst descriptive analysis of data has been carried out so far. Data analyses were
conducted, inter alia, with a view to estimating diﬀerences in compliance with design
requirements according to (1) total compliance with requirements, (2) branches of
industry, (3) individual workstations, (4) design areas and (5) speciﬁc requirements
(individual items) by performing separate analyses of conformance with these require‐
ments, based on calculating and accumulating percentages of compliance with indi‐
vidual requirements, e.g. with items and aspects under consideration.

Results
3.1
Compliance in General
Descriptive analyses of compliance with all requirements as well as at checklist design
area level or item level indicate substantial diﬀerences in the design quality of the alarm
system and the alarm management across all workstations analyzed. The results show
that none of the systems under investigation fulﬁlled all design recommendations
derived from the relevant literature, guidelines or standards, as would have been
expected, given the diversity of systems under investigation (see Fig. 1). All analyzed
objects have design deﬁciencies and there is partly considerable room and necessity for
improvement.
Fig. 1. Compliance across systems under investigation
Regarding single compliance rates, only about 9–34% good design condition and
about 15–32% acceptable, but improvable condition over all requirements leaves about
38–76% of non-compliance with normative requirements based on relevant guidelines
or the available evidence, so that even for the system with the best compliance remains
a degree of non-compliance of 38%, which would argue for necessary improvements in
the design and management of the alarm systems under consideration.
Comparing sectors of industry showed less compliance in the food industry than in the
other two, with only slight differences between the chemical and the power industries.
Comparing design areas, it becomes obvious that prioritization of alarms, consider‐
ation of operator limits and providing action guidance show most deﬁciencies in the
technical design of the system (N.B. the sum of items per design area diﬀers, see Fig. 2),
while continuous improvement and (especially) systematic training and training
concepts for alarm handling represent the areas of the greatest design deﬁciencies on
the organizational level.

3.2
(Non-)compliance with Speciﬁc Requirements
Going down to the level of individual items (see Fig. 2) it can be seen that – across all
systems under investigation – a few items achieve acceptable compliance rates, whereas
others achieve high degrees of non-compliance (the higher the value, the higher the
degree of non-compliance), e.g. from the areas of training (TR), alarm prioritization
(PR), action guidelines and system interactions (HA) and continuous improvement
(KV), as reported above. In general, however, there is a large variation in compliance
with individual items.
Fig. 2. Compliance with individual requirements
On a positive note, for example, new alarms (i.e. deviations from normal or
nominal conditions requiring action, malfunction of plant components etc.), presented
in flow diagrams for monitoring and controlling the process, were showed by special
visual coding (e.g. changing symbols, colors or dynamics of the plant components or
parameters) in all examined workstations. They were usually presented in signal
colors, so that they stand out clearly from other (non-alarm) process information in
order to attract the attention of the control room operators. On the other hand, in some
cases the color contrast to the normal state or to the entire flow diagram (back‐
ground) could or should have been larger; e.g. in some cases – and potentially
misleading – red is used not for alarms only but also as a color for a medium and the
512
M. Bockelmann et al.

medium-carrying pipes or valves are also shown on the flow diagram in saturated red
(i.e. red = alarm and red ≠ alarm), which can lead to confusion.
In most cases, retrievable or permanently open trends were available, which enabled
the control room operators to recognize changes in process parameters or approaches to
alarm limits at an early stage (before an alarm occurs) and thus to be able to act proac‐
tively. However, again there was a problem that the colors used for illustrating trends
sometimes did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the background (for example, dark blue trend
lines against a black background, light green lines on light gray).
Interestingly, the participating companies had dealt with the possibility of hacker
attacks and provided appropriate measures to prevent unauthorized access, albeit not
always during the construction of a control room, but at least in the later stages. However,
in this study it could not be veriﬁed whether or to what extent the measures taken were
actually eﬀective in the event of an outside attack into the system.
On the other hand, it seems alarming that for nearly two-thirds of the systems under
investigation alarms were not prioritized according to their importance and urgency. In
these cases, instead, the control room operators had to make their decisions ad hoc based
on their know-how and experience, with a view to which alarm/alarms they had to deal
with ﬁrst in the respective situation. This deﬁciency seems to be important in critical
situations, in particular when the alarm rate increases and the operator has to make quick
decisions in the case of a major disturbance.
In order to identify the cause of the problem and to derive appropriate measures,
only the text of the one-line alarm message was available to most control room operators.
Help systems with process-speciﬁc or alarm-related help texts (i.e. with further assisting
information) which help operators to understand what has happened and how to respond
appropriately to an alarm almost never existed and if so, only for a few selected alarms.
Operators had to rely on their knowledge and experience or on the knowledge and expe‐
rience of their colleagues.
In only a few of the participating control rooms, the alarm events were systematically
and regularly analyzed in order to continuously monitor and improve the performance
of the alarm system (e.g. reduction of alarm rate, presentation of only relevant alarms
to the operator) and to optimize the stress and strain on operators. In some cases, this
process was still under construction but in most cases, the alarm events as well as the
operating actions were not (systematically) analyzed.
Written alarm strategies or alarm concepts were very rare and if they existed, they
were sometimes seriously lacking detail. Alarm management activities or improvements
to the system have mostly taken place unsystematically or only reactively, e.g. after
special events or after hints from operators.
Control room operators were usually given plant training and instruction in the
operating functions of the process control system in use. Speciﬁc and systematic training
in dealing with alarms, high alarm rates and critical situations etc., however, were very
rare. Normally, new employees are introduced to their jobs by their colleagues (sitting
next to Nelly). First, they often start as an outside plant operator to get to know the plant
and its processes before they come into the control room as second operator at the oper‐
ating station, where they ﬁrst look over the shoulder of the experienced control room
operator and gradually take over monitoring and controlling of the plant. However, this

513

investigation showed that as a result of such strategies helpful functions were sometimes
not known or familiar to the control room operators.

Discussion
The results of this study indicate that alarm systems, at least those under investigation,
including the alarm management, diﬀer widely in their ergonomic design quality. The
present ﬁndings show, from an ergonomic point of view, considerable design deﬁcien‐
cies and in part violations of normative design requirements. At least the design solutions
under consideration did not represent the current state of the art or science. The results
indicate deviations from ergonomic requirements with regard to the design of the human-
machine-interface, the alarm prioritization, the alarm management and systematic oper‐
ator training concerning the alarm systems and the handling of alarms.
Since the guidelines or normative requirements which served as a basis for the used
checklist are evidence based, both on practical experience as well as on scientiﬁc
evidence, non-compliance with these requirements must be considered a severe violation
of operational safety. The amount of such violations and in part their basic character
was surprising. The question thus is whether these results are representative (and for
what type of population) or poorly biased.
We have no idea about the representativeness of our results for countries other than
Germany, although there were international companies included in the sample.
However, we had some diﬃculties in drawing up our sample (with process control and
alarm systems as the unit of inquiry), as is usual in investigations like this. It was not
that easy to get the cooperation of companies for this kind of research and in our expe‐
rience, the sample is not at all representative but deﬁnitely positively biased, since it can
be assumed that companies who knew they might have problems with compliance and
therefore thought they would perform poorly in such an investigation, would not agree
to take part in this study. In this respect, we would be willing to expect that in reality
things might deﬁnitely look worse.
The results might thus suggest that the relevance of the problem is still larger than
expected but this can only be tested by performing a replication study, most preferably
in a diﬀerent country, to see whether our results are unique or systematic.
In any case, these results should (and will) be discussed with the companies involved,
in order to help them develop appropriate measures to improve their process safety. The
analyses of individual process control systems yield recommendations about how to
improve the situation and some of them are easy to implement, while others would
require a system update or severe interventions into the system.
Discussions with labor inspectorates and worker compensation boards have been
started to see how they could take up the issue and provide assistance for their companies.
As this was what we learned when feeding back the results to the participating compa‐
nies: They were unaware about the problem (at least about its size) and those who took
part in the study did so, because they were looking for help, other than from the manu‐
facturers of the systems. It must be admitted, that some consortia are working on these
problems (e.g. ASM Consortium) but obviously there is still a lot to do.

Abstract. Order picking activities are most labour-intensive process in retail
warehouse. Although order picking automation is possible, it still requires human
worker’s activities. There have been various order picking systems in the ﬁeld
for decades but after amazon’s KIVA system was introduced, the interest in this
ﬁeld has been rising. Most advanced order picking system can be classiﬁed into
AS/RS type and moving robot type. Both types are goods-to-picker systems, the
purpose of the systems is reducing picker’s travel time to ﬁnd a locations of
products and move to pick them in accordance with customer’s request. In many
researches, the eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness of the automated order picking
systems are focused on the system performance aspect. Although humans are
essential actors in the order picking system and key factors for both eﬀectiveness
and eﬃciency of order picking process, the human factors of these systems are
rarely evaluated. In this paper, we focus on the ergonomic aspects of order picking
system. We compared the ergonomic factors of two types of the system- moving
robot and AS/RS type using digital human modeling (DHM) application (Delmia
Human) and the assessment of risk factors for work-related musculoskeletal
disorders (WMSDs) was conducted. We collected the data and information of
automated order picking systems which are popular and applied on the site, and
created virtual work place scenarios for two order picking systems. Diverse
human factors were analyzed in DELMIA software with digital manikins consid‐
ering various anthropometric data.

Introduction
Over the last decades there has been a huge development of the automation of material
handling in warehouse. Order picking activities are most labour-intensive process in
retail warehouse [1]. Although order picking automation is possible, it still requires
human worker’s activities. Since customer’s request are getting more diversiﬁed and
requirement for small quantity order are more demanding, order picking task in retail
warehouse need more high ﬂexibility.
The order of picking activities in retail warehouse consists of lifting, moving,
picking, putting, packing, and other procedures. Although these activities are very

simple and easy, most of them are repetitive and physically required. It may bring out
musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) for pickers.
There have been various order picking systems in the ﬁeld for decades but after
amazon’s KIVA system was introduced, the interest in this ﬁeld has been rising. Order
picking systems evolve into robot-human co-work systems as well as task automation.
The former automation system is a computer aided system that automates functions such
as lights, barcodes, and conveyers, but the latest order picking system brings goods right
up to the picker. In many researches, the eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness of the automated
order picking systems are focused on the system performance aspect. Although humans
are essential actors in the order picking system and key factors for both eﬀectiveness
and eﬃciency of order picking process, the human factors of these systems are rarely
evaluated.
There are several researches in ergonomics factors for order picking systems, most
of them focused on the conceptual frame or consideration for planning [2].
A principal beneﬁt of automation is that it can reduce the human user’s workload,
both mental and physical [3]. In order picking systems, to a large degree, it may can
reduce human workers’ physical workload. The task for robot in order picking systems
is mainly information acquisition, moving to stock shelves and bringing stock bins to
human workers. So in order picking systems the range of task for human workers is to
ﬁnd the correct item from the stock bins or shelves and put it in the order bins. Compared
to the manual order picking, the range of task that human workers have to do was
reduced, but it doesn’t mean working hour of human workers is decreased. Human
workers need to do the same task - pulling and putting items-repetitively. So it is impor‐
tant to evaluate ergonomic factors and disorders risk factors.
We focus on the practice of this ﬁeld, compared the ergonomic factors of two types
of the system- moving robot and AS/RS type using digital human modeling (DHM)
application (Delmia Human) [4] and the assessment of risk factors for work-related
musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) was conducted.

Human-Robot Co-work Order Picking Systems
There are various types of automated order picking systems, it can be categorized by
their technologies and conﬁgurations. The most advanced systems are goods-to-person
order picking systems, and that can be classiﬁed into 4 types [5].
• Mini-load ASRS(Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems)
• Carousel ASRS
• Shuttle-based ASRS
• Robotic rover systems
At the end of the system there should be order picking station for human workers.
But there is a diﬀerence between the above three and the last one. The above three
systems are categorized by storage/retrieval method and moving way, but they all uses
bins or boxes or tote. In case of last one, the robot moves a shelf to the picker. For the
human workers the two order picking systems need divergent physical activities.

2.1
AS/RS Type Order Picking Systems
In AS/RS type order picking systems totes or boxes containing goods for customer’s
orders are retrieved from storage racks or shelves and transported by conveyor or moving
vehicles to the picking station. When the totes enter the picking station they are scanned
and the monitor in front of human worker shows the quantity of items according to
customer’s order [6]. The picker at the picking station takes the items from the stock
tote and put them into order bins. There are various forms and conﬁgurations of AS/RS
order picking systems, but the picking station for human workers mostly looks like
Fig. 1. A stock bin that contains items arrives in the middle of the station then picker
checks the monitor that indicate the quantity of items for customer’s order and take the
items out of the stock bin. The order bins are placed on both sides of the stock bins. The
picker moves holding picked items to the order bin and put them into the order bin.
Fig. 1. Picking station for AS/RS type order picking system
2.2
Moving Robot Type Order Picking Systems
In moving robot type order picking systems, autonomous moving robots are used to
move the goods from inventory zones to the human workers who accomplish picking
task [7]. Figure 2 shows picking station of moving robot type order picking systems that
include storage shelf brought by robot and order bins. If the robot enters picking station
with storage shelf, the light on the cell that contains items to be picked ﬂickers and the
picker takes items out of the shelf. Then the picker turns around puts the items into the
order bins according to customer’s order.

Subjects and Task
In the past, a large portion of workers in the warehouse were male and young female
workers in Korea. However the ratio of employed women and elders has increased since
2002 up to 24% in 2012 [8]. The order picking task handles relatively light weight items
compared with other manual material handling tasks. In this study the subjects for digital
human model is female retail warehouse workers. From video working on Amazon’s
warehouse we can get movements of pickers who act picking activity in Kiva systems
for moving robot type order picking systems. For AS/RS type order picking systems we
made a virtual working station with reference to various AS/RS manufacturers (Dematic,
Opex KNAPP, Symbotic, and Vanderlande).
3.2
Posture and Task Simulation
The order picking task at picking stations consists of 3 steps. Simply from worker’s
point of view ﬁrstly they pick the items from a shelf or a stock bin and secondly check
the items and move to the order bin/box then lastly put them into the order bin. Based
on the observation from the videos we classiﬁed picking tasks of the Kiva system into
3 types as shown in Fig. 3. Task A is order picking task that include stretching arms
above the shoulders to pick items from high level of the shelf, task B are modeled as
picking from the shelf that its height ranges between worker’s knees and shoulders. Task
C include the worker’s picking posture kneeling because the items to be picked placed
on lower level of the shelf. In AS/RS type order picking systems the picking postures
are so similar in all cases that we modeled one picking task as Fig. 4. This task include
picking, walking to the order bin and putting items into the order bin, and every posture
is a standing act.

Posture Assessment
The risk levels of working postures were assessed by RULA included in DELMIA
HUMAN. It was developed to investigate the exposure of individual workers to risks
associated with work-related upper limb disorders [9]. The RULA analysis examines
the following risk factors: number of movements, static muscle work, force, working
posture, and time worked without a break. All these factors combine to provide a ﬁnal
score that ranges from 1 to 7. Table 1 shows the RULA criterions [10].

Results and Discussion
Table 2 presents RULA ﬁnal scores as human worker’s risk assessment of two types of
order picking systems. As mentioned before, the picking tasks for the moving robot type
order picking system are classiﬁed into 3types related to the picker’s picking posture.
During the task simulation the RULA scores were recorded according to the time ﬂow,
the score range was 3–7.

which earn the 5 or more points. Table 3 presents the RULA score details for body parts.
Posture A is picking activity for human worker to stretch her arms and pick items placed
on high level of shelf. This posture put a lot of pressure on a neck, trunk and leg so the
high score has been marked. Posture B and D is the activities to put the items on the
tote-box, the risk factor shows on wrist and arm (score 5). Posture C is the picking
activity to pick up the item from low level shelf. Since the worker should kneel, the high
scores were marked from neck, trunk and leg part (Fig. 5).

This simulation shows that in ergonomic terms AS/RS type order picking systems
have lower risk level for human worker’s MSDs. Posture A and C needs immediate
change for human workers. In most retail warehouse they treat small and light weight
goods but repetitive material handling activities expose workers to physical disorders
due to gradual and cumulative deterioration of the musculoskeletal system [11]. To
lower risk levels for human workers, we can consider workstation adjustment, training,
equipment change and work method [12].
In case of moving robot order picking systems it can be improved by removing
kneeling and stretching arms above shoulders. There are some suggested methods for
improving working condition which are equipment adjustment and changing stock

allocation strategy. To eliminate kneeling for picking items it can be considered to
introduce lifting device at picking station. Changing stock allocation strategy considered
order frequency may reduce risk factors on stretching activities. But both economic and
ergonomic aspects for warehouse management should be considered, it needs further
study to make decision of improving working conditions.

Conclusion
The order picking tasks by human workers in robot-human co-work order picking
systems are more easy and simple than fully manual order picking systems that includes
stocking, walking, lifting, carrying, pulling, pushing, picking, putting and etc. But that
means the human workers need to do same task repetitively. This can cause overuse of
the same muscle groups and also lead MSDs [13]. In this research we conducted virtual
workplace assessment simulations for most advanced and adapted robot-human co-work
order picking systems focus on ergonomic factors. We created virtual work place
scenarios for two order picking systems and the assessment and comparison were
conducted using digital human modeling (DHM) application. As a result AS/RS type
order picking system has lower risk factors for human workers and picking station in
moving robot type order picking systems needs posture change critically.
This study focuses on ergonomic risk factors on human-robot co-work order picking
systems and does not consider other factors like performance and economic factors.
Thus further research eﬀorts are required to make a guideline or method to improve
working conditions considering ergonomic and economic factors that inﬂuence ware‐
house performance.

Abstract. In order to prevent medical accidents related to drugs, not only
developing safe drugs but also their proper use is important. In this paper, we
proposed the method to measure look-alikeness between not only backside
designs but also front side designs. Since the major difference between backside
designs and front sides is the existence of tables or capsules, we applied image
inpainting technique to convert the original PTP front side images to “tabletless”
PTP sheet images. In order to employ inpainting technique, a neural network
was used to obtain a mask image which masks tablet/capsule parts. To the
resultant images, the similarity index calculation was applied as proposed in our
previous study.

Introduction
In order to prevent medical accidents related to drugs, not only developing safe drugs
but also their proper use is important. Confusing packages of drugs are one of major
causes to mix-up drugs. In order to prevent accidents caused by confusing packages,
Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan discussed and adopted countermea-
sures, such as notice that a Press-Through-Package (PTP) sheet, a packaging unit of
medical drug tablets, needs to have a GS1 data bar deﬁned in JIS X 0509:2012/ISO
IEC 24724:2011 [1, 2]. However, it is not enough. Because medical accidents or
incidents occur in the case a combination of a few or more causes happen, for example,
lack of scanning barcode and confusion of package design can cause accidents or
incidents. Additionally, after patients get PTP sheets, the barcode cannot be scanned
and cannot prevent the confusion.
In our past study [3], we employed Fourier analysis to the periodical design of PTP
sheets to extract their features. Since periodicity of the design is two dimensional, we
applied two dimensional Fourier transform to the design. From the result, we clariﬁed
that we can separately deal with the atom part of design (prototile) and the periodicity
of its copies. We assumed that the busy situation makes pharmacists roughly see the
designs and get confused for similar ones. Moreover, we extend the idea to take
account of color distribution in PTP sheets and propose a similarity index to measure

look-alikeness [4]. However, the target of the previous study was limited to backside
designs of PTP sheets.
In this paper, we propose its extended idea, which enables to measure
look-alikeness between not only backside designs but also front side designs. The
major difference between backside and front side is the existence of tables or capsules.
Since a front side design of some PTP sheet was reportedly confused to the backside of
another and caused an incident, we need to compare backside designs with the part
other than tablets/capsules on front sides of PTP sheets. We, therefore, applied image
inpainting technique to convert the original PTP front side images to “tabletless” PTP
sheet images. In order to employ inpainting technique, a neural network was used to
obtain a mask image which masks tablet/capsule parts. To the images and backside
images, we applied the similarity index calculation proposed in our previous study.
Besides, we will show the results of evaluation of our method.

Methodology
The confusion incident of front side and backside designs suggests that we should
contrast the background images of front side designs instead of their full images. In
other words, we can say that the tablets having a familiar shape and color, namely,
round and white, do not cause similarity of front side images. Because of this, we
erased the tablet parts from the front side image, if the tablet is round and white, before
we calculate a similarity index. In order to erase the parts, we employed an image
inpainting technique. Image inpainting is a method to interpolate a damaged part
speciﬁed by a mask image. For our purpose, the interpolated parts were not damaged
parts but the parts where tablets sit.
The following PTP image samples were downloaded from the web site of a
pharmaceutical company, Sawai [5].
The main steps of our method were as follows:
1. If the tablets in a target PTP sheet were round and white, we applied an image
inpainting method. We implemented this program with functions of OpenCV
library. It requires a mask image ﬁle, which speciﬁes the part to be interpolated.
Since the positions of tablets depend on PTP sheet designs, we need to generate a
mask image suitable for each PTP sheet. In order to generate it, we applied Image
thresholding and a neural network to original PTP design images.
2. The similarity index proposed in our past study [] was used to calculate similarity.
We converted the images from RGB color space to L*a*b* color space, utilized
Fourier transformation, applied a low pass ﬁlter and calculated the distance between
them (dF). We also calculated the difference of image shift patterns (dshift).
3. In Step 2, we ignored DC components. This is because they are proportional to delta
functions, and their contribution is more dominant than other components. In order
to balance their contribution, we separately calculated the mean values of back-
ground images of the target PTP sheets and their Euclidean distance (dbg).
4. We combined the distances, dF, dshift and dbg with their corresponding weight xF,
xshift, xbg as:
A Press-Through Package Design Similarity Index
525

ddiff ¼ xFdF þ xshiftdshift þ xbgdbg:
ð1Þ
Though the values of dF and dshift are comparable, dbg tends to be less than them.
We, therefore, set xF ¼ xshift ¼ 1 and xbg¼c ¼ dF
dbg [ 1, where dF and dbg are
average values of dF and dshift.
We normalized the distance ddiff by dividing it by its maximum value:
Ddiff ¼
ddiff
maxðddiff Þ  100:
ð2Þ
Figure 1 illustrates the results with xbg ¼ 1 and xbg ¼ c. In the case xbg ¼ 1, the
background color (yellow) is not well reﬂected on the distance. Instead, in the case
xbg ¼ c, the closest design has the same background color and, therefore, we can
expect the least Ddiff gives the most similar PTP sheet design.
2.1
Image Thresholding
In Step 1, we need to generate a mask image. In order to extract the positions of tablets,
we utilized image thresholding technique (Fig. 2):
i. The color of the image was converted into a gray scale image.
ii. We applied image thresholding to the gray scale image.
iii. Though we obtained ﬁne diagonal lattice patterns as a background, we need to ﬁll
the background with black. Therefore, we utilized connected-component labeling
and ﬁlled the connected components with black color.
2.2
Neural Network
As we can see Fig. 2., there are still unnecessary white dots. In order to remove them,
we employed a feed forward neural network.

(right) the design with the least distance for xbg ¼ c.

We regarded a 5  5 sized square as an input of the neural network and 5  5
sized output, which was expected to output a square image without the unnecessary
white dots. The hidden layer had 25 neurons. The neural network scans 5  5 sized
square regions without overlap in the image.
We trained the neural network with a training set, an image obtained in Sect. 2.1 as
input and its corresponding mask image made manually as output.
After the training, we applied the network to the resultant images of image
thresholding, and obtained a source of mask image required by image inpainting.
Figure 3 illustrates the result.

Extraction of Tablet Portion Rectangles
In order to obtain the mask parts, which we call tablet portion rectangles, we again
apply connected-component labeling to the white colored part where tablets exist. After
that, in order to remove residual noise, we applied dilation. From the result, we cal-
culated the centroid xc, the height h and the width w of each white part. The rectangle
with average height h and weight w was located at each xc.

Application of Image Inpainting
With the mask image obtained in Sect. 2.3, we applied image inpainting to PTP sheet
designs (Fig. 5).

Evaluation
In order to evaluate our method, we conducted an experiment, where we compared the
values of Ddiff with the responses of subjects.
3.1
Method
We randomly selected two target PTP sheets (Fig. 6) and used their foreground images
(Pa and Pb). Moreover, we selected three PTP sheets for each of the target sheets,
which have smallest, medium and largest Ddiff values to the target (Pa-1, Pa-2 and
Pa-3 in Fig. 7 for Pa and Pb-1, Pb-2 and Pb-3 in Fig. 8 for Pb respectively). We
combined each of the target PTP sheets and each of the selected sheets as pairs.

foreground images (left in each of above images).
Fig. 7. The PTP sheet images compared with Pa. The left image has the least Ddiff value (Pa-1),
medium value (Pa-2) and the largest value (Pa-3).

The pairs were presented to subjects for two seconds in order to simulate busy
situation for pharmacists during drug preparation []. After the presentation, the subjects
answered their extent of similarity by showing the value between 0 (dissimilar) and 100
(same).
The subjects were 10 university students.
3.2
Results and Discussion
Table 1 shows the mean values of subject responses for similarity between target
images and compared images, and their corresponding Ddiff values.
Firstly, we can see the tendency that the mean values of subjects’ responses
increase, if the values of Ddiff increase.
Secondly, we noticed that the mean value of responses about the pair Pa and Pa-1
is much larger than its corresponding Ddiff value, though it is less than the mean values
of other pairs. Though both Pa and Pa-1 were front side, our method did not apply

image inpainting to the images, since the color of capsules in Pa-1 was yellow. This
occurred, even though the tablet/capsule parts were not excluded in Ddiff calculation.
This suggests that we need to increase the contribution of tablet/capsule colors in Ddiff
calculation.
Finally, both the mean value of responses and Ddiff value between the pair Pb and
Pb-1 were small. We should notice that Pb was front side and Pb-1 was backside. This
suggests that the use of front side designs excluding tablet/capsule parts have a crucial
role on similarity calculation in the case we compare the front side of some PTP sheet
with the backside of other sheet.

Conclusion
In order to ensure the proper use of drugs, especially tablets and capsules, we proposed
the method to measure similarity between both front side and backside designs of PTP
sheets.
Since the major difference between backside images and front side images is the
existence of tables or capsules, we used a neural network to obtain a suitable mask
image to erase tablet/capsule parts by image inpainting technique. We also deﬁned the
distance, Ddiff , with a coefﬁcient c for the contribution of background color dbg. The
correction by c balanced the contribution from the variance of design and the contri-
bution from background color, and provided us with the close PTP design image
having the least Ddiff value.
In the future, we will improve the deﬁnition of Ddiff to include the contribution of
colors of tablets/capsules and the contribution of edge parts.

Abstract. Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) affect millions of
workers in Europe and cost employers billions of Euros. Quality control
workstations usually demand the adoption of awkward and uncomfortable
postures for long periods, which may stress and fatigue supporting muscles and
tendons, leading to the development of MSDs. An Ergonomic Work Analysis
covered the working conditions of an industrial quality section and the main
risks factors were highlighted. The main objectives were: to assess the actual
working conditions; to establish relationships between these and the complaints
workers presented; to characterize each task in terms of the associated MSDs
development risk; to present preventive measures. Rapid Entire Body Assess-
ment and Ovako Working Posture Analyzing System analyzed seventeen pos-
tures. Both methods scored three and ﬁve postures, respectively, with a high risk
of developing MSDs whereas ten postures were qualiﬁed as of medium risk.
Technical and organizational solutions were proposed and implemented.

Introduction
Human Factors/Ergonomics (HFE) focuses on systems in which humans interact with
all the other elements. When we talk about HFE we should have in consideration that
two related outcomes are relevant: performance (e.g. productivity, efﬁciency, effec-
tiveness, quality, innovativeness, ﬂexibility, (systems) safety and security, reliability,
sustainability) and well-being (e.g. health and safety, satisfaction, pleasure, learning,
personal development). Reduced performance and well-being can occur when there is a
mismatch between the system and human capabilities and aspirations. Thus, these two
outcomes are related e.g., performance can inﬂuence well-being, and this last one can
inﬂuence performance, both in the short and the long-term [1]. The possibility of
performing to a high standard at work is an important prerequisite for satisfaction and
wellbeing. In other words, wellbeing and performance are strongly connected and

should be understood to promote good outcomes. When this does not occur, fatigue
and work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) could arise among workers per-
forming these jobs [2].
Quality deﬁciencies, wasted products, human errors and ergonomics problems often
have the same cause. In many cases they can be ascribed to the design of work,
workplace and environment, and to factors such as noise, light, postures, loads, pace
and/or work content, among others [3]. There is strong evidence that working groups
with high levels of static contraction, prolonged static loads, or extreme working pos-
tures involving neck/shoulder muscles are at increased risk for neck/shoulder MSDs.
Over 40 epidemiologic studies have examined physical workplace factors and their
relationship to neck/shoulder and back MSDs [4].
MSDs are one of the most common work-related ailments. Throughout Europe they
affect millions of workers and cost employers billions of euros [5, 6]. In fact, work
related MSDs are among the most costly health problems that society is facing today [7].
As known, at assembly work systems, workers can face to some of this risk factors.
Quality control workstations usually demand the adoption of awkward and uncom-
fortable postures for long periods of time, which may stress and fatigue supporting
muscles and tendons, leading to the development of MSDs.
An Ergonomic Work Analysis covered the working conditions of an industrial
quality section and the main risks factors were highlighted.
The main objectives were: to assess the actual working conditions; to establish
relationships between these and the complaints workers presented; to characterize each
task in terms of the associated MSDs development risk; to present preventive measures.

Materials and Methods
2.1
Stages of the Study
This study comprised three fundamental stages:
• 1st stage: General characterization of the Work Situations;
• 2nd stage: MSDs risk assessment and lighting condition characterization;
• 3rd stage: Preventive measures.
The 1st stage began with the characterization of operators and the quality control
workstation. Therefore, it included task’s identiﬁcation and characterization, in terms of
prescribed objectives as well as in terms of general executing conditions. At this stage,
the characterization of the work situations focused on the prevalence of complaints
(physical annoyance, discomfort and pain or eyestrain).
The 2nd stage aimed to better characterize the problematic situations identiﬁed in
the previous stage. Therefore, the risk of MSDs development and lighting conditions
were assessed.
The 3rd stage consisted of the proposal of technical and organizational preventive
measures and included an “anti-fatigue” mat study.

2.2
Data Collection and Procedures
Different methods and techniques were used to characterize the work situation and
workers involved, such as:
• Conversation with workers;
• Documental Analysis (e.g.: task procedures, risk assessment and lighting assess-
ment reports, occupational accidents reports…);
• Free/systematized and retrospective observations;
• Environmental characterization with particular emphasis on lighting conditions and
dimensional characterization;
• Image/video recording;
• a questionnaire speciﬁcally developed for this purpose.
For Image/video recording, a digital camera with 4 megapixel and 1920  1080
HD resolution - Sony HD ACHO Full HD1080 handycam 4.0.
The dimensional characterization of the workstations was made using a measuring
tape.
The questionnaire was based on the adapted version of the Nordic Musculoskeletal
Questionnaire [8, 9] and intended to identify key parameters for the workers’ char-
acterization, evaluate their perception of the real working conditions, as well as to
identify self-reported symptoms in terms of physical annoyance, discomfort or pain and
eyestrain. On the ﬁrst section, sociodemographic items such as gender, age, anthro-
pometric data (height, weight, dominant upper limb), seniority and second job were
integrated to better characterization of the workers. Additionally, this section integrates
items to characterize the operators’ relationship with the organization (such as, number
of hours worked per week, type of schedule, frequency and duration of work breaks).
The second section integrated items to better characterization of the activity. The
operators were asked about “the necessity for rotate between different workplaces
jobs”, “the receive/not receive instructions before starting the activity”, “why they
need to compare different pieces under inspection” and “what is the main difﬁcult felt
when they make the pieces’ inspection which have different colors? (for example: gold
or grey)”. The third section included items to determine the occurrence of muscu-
loskeletal symptoms and respective intensity of pain (a four-level Likert scale was
used, where 1-low intensity and 4-very high intensity). For this purpose a body dis-
comfort chart was added. The musculoskeletal symptoms (annoyance, discomfort and
physical pain) were assessed over the last 12 months and the last 7 days. Symptoms of
pain or discomfort were recorded as occurrence of pain. In this session the presence of
visual fatigue and respective frequency (a four-level Likert scale was used, where
1-very low frequency and 4-very high frequency) were also evaluated. The operators
were also asked about “How often they feel difﬁcult to perceive the information as a
consequence of the visual strain” and “how they classify the work in terms of stress?”
For the last two questions a four-level Likert scale was used (1-Never/not stressful;
2-sometimes/moderate stressful; 3-Very often/very stressful; 4-Always/Extremely
stressful).
To participate in this study a verbal consent of the operators involved was previ-
ously obtained. The workers responded to the questionnaire independently and

anonymously. In all cases, the conﬁdentiality of data were insured. All workers
(N = 17) agreed to participate in the study.
MSDs developing risk assessment relied on two methods: Rapid Entire Body
Assessment (REBA) and Ovako Working Posture Analyzing System (OWAS).
A complete description of the REBA and OWAS methods can be found in the works
written by Hignettand McAtamney [10, 11] and by Louhevaara and Suurnäkki [12],
respectively.
In terms of methodology, both methods were applied according to the ﬂowchart
illustrated in Fig. 1.
Seventeen postures were analyzed in two particular tasks accomplished in that
section: “2-pieces cans’ inspection” and “tops’ inspection”.
For postures’ selection the following criteria were used, taking in account that the
decision could be based on one or more criteria: most frequently repeated posture;
longest maintained posture; posture requiring the higher muscular activity or the
greatest forces; posture known to cause discomfort; extreme, unstable, or awkward
posture, especially where a force is exerted.
Considering that different operators can use different strategies for the same task,
several images were collected. By providing several task images it was possible to
identify the strategy with the lowest level of risk.
As a reference, low REBA score and low OWAS score indicate that the work
posture is acceptable but for the higher scores, an action is suggested [11, 12].
In REBA method load ranking was based on biomechanical criteria. Considering
that scores obtained for neck, trunk and legs are combined in a particular score called
score “A” and those for shoulder, elbow and wrist give a particular score “B”, both
were also highlighted. In REBA method, group B postures were scored for the left and
the right sides, always, considering the worst posture adopted on each side.
Considering that both methods have a different action level scale, REBA and
OWAS Scores were adapted to facilitate the comparison between both approaches. The
relationship between each REBA Score, OWAS Score and corresponding adapted
Action Level is showed in Table 1.
The illuminance (lux) level was assessed with a digital Krochmann lux meter, 106E
model, which was strategically put on the surface of the workstations, following the
procedures recommended by EN 12464-1:2011 standard [13].
Fig. 1. Flowchart illustrating the REBA and OWAS methodology applied.

A grid system was created to indicate the points at which the illuminance should be
veriﬁed for the task and the surrounding areas. Ratio of the length to width of the grid
was kept between 0.5 and 2 and the maximum grid size was obtained with Eq. 1.
p ¼ 0:2  5logd
ð1Þ
where,
p – maximum grid cell size (m);
d – longer dimension of the area (m).
The number of points in relevant dimension is given by the nearest whole number
of d=p.
All measurements were made during the night shift to register the illuminance levels
exclusively due to the artiﬁcial light. Three different workbench positions (A, B and C)
were used to evaluate lighting. A and B represent the positions of benches for the “tops’
inspection” task, while C represents the position for the “2-pieces cans’ inspection” task.
Positions A and B were evaluated in order to realize if there are signiﬁcant differences in
terms of illuminance, since there are different types of luminaires and lamps installed on
site and operators are free to place the benches wherever they want. Both A and B
positions were selected by the operators on the day of the measurement and were
considered to be less favorable to the occurrence of reﬂections and shadows which
impair performance. The location of bench C corresponds to the location most fre-
quently selected by the operators, when performing the respective task. On benches
A and B, measurement were made in two different zone (Zone1, Zone2) considering the
different positions of the two operators.
The correlated colour temperature (CCT) values of each lamp were registered.
For “anti-fatigue” mat study, three suppliers were contacted, in order to test three
different products with the operators. Each “anti-fatigue” mat was tested for two
consecutive weeks in order to involve all operators in the process. At the end of the 1st
week using the “anti-fatigue” mat, operators were asked to respond to an opinion
questionnaire. The most well-accepted mat would be proposed to be acquired for all
workstations.

Data Analysis
For data processing the SPSS© software was used and descriptive analyzes were
performed using measures of location and dispersion.
The BMI variable was calculated considering weight (kg) and height (m) data
provided by the workers (BMI = weight/height2).
The corrected Action Level 2 was considered the level for which MSDs develop-
ment occurs according to both methods (OWAS and REBA).
To interpret the illuminance (lx) levels, the values recommended by EN12464-1:2011
Standard [13], were used. The corrections proposed by NF_X35-103:2013 Standard [14],
taking into account age (>45), reﬂection and contrast factors, error relevance, task fre-
quency and lack of natural lighting, were considered when needed. Considering the
high-level visual demand in both tasks, the recommended Illuminance (lx) and the uni-
formity values were 750 lx and >0.7, respectively, for the task area. For the surrounding
area a 500 lx Illuminance level was recommended. In terms of light color appearance, CCT
above 5000K is recommended.
The illuminance level was measured at each deﬁned point and the average
(Eaverage), the maximum and the minimum (Emax and Emin, respectively) values as well
as the uniformity (U) value were calculated.

Results and Discussion
3.1
Socio-Demographics’ and Job’s Characteristics
All workers (N = 17) of the quality control section were female and agreed to par-
ticipate in the study. The age of participants ranged from 19 to 53 years (mean = 36.94
years; SD = 10.17 years). The participants weigh 68 kg on average (SD = 9.94 kg;
range = 53–90 kg) were 1. 64 m high on average (SD = 0.06; range = 1.54–1.80 m)
and presented an average BMI of 25.2 kg/m2 (SD = 3.24 kg/m2, range = 19 and
32 kg/m2), which mean that more than 58.8% are overweight. The majority of oper-
ators (82.4%) reported that they were not involved in regular physical activities/sport.
All workers were right handed.
The operators had been working in their current job for 1 to 55 months (mean =
13.94 month; SD = 17.84 month). The mean daily and weekly working hours were 8
and 40 h, respectively. All workers alternate between two shifts (Shift 1:8 h to 16 h;
Shift 2:16 h to 24 h) on a weekly base. Workers are allowed to take two breaks/day
(one with 10 min and another with 30/45 min duration). This means that all partici-
pants are involved in working periods longer than 2 h in each shift. All participants
were paid on a piece-rate salary system. Seventy-one percent of the workers feel their
work as moderately stressful. No workers had a second job.
3.2
Self-reported Symptoms
Considering the self-reported symptoms (annoyance, discomfort and pain) 76.5% of
the workers reported complaints and it was possible to identify ﬁve main body regions

affected: neck (47%), upper and lowerback (53%), legs (59%) and feet (29%) (Fig. 2).
The results also show that the majority of the participants had experienced MSDs on
the feet (100%), the lower back and the wrist (67%), the legs (60%), the upper back
(44%) and the neck (12%), over the last 7 days. In terms of intensity, the majority of
the situations, ranged between moderate and very high. It is important highlight that it
was high or very high in 33% of cases.
Prolonged standing postures can be responsible for the complaints reported with
particular emphasis on legs, feet and lower back.
Considering visual fatigue, 58.8% of the workers complained. Fifty percent out of
the workers that reported visual fatigue considered that these symptoms had some
impact in perceiving information. The main symptoms appointed were itchy eyes
(50%) red eyes and headache (40%), blurred vision (30%) and tears or others symp-
toms (10%) (Fig. 3).
3.3
OWAS and RULA Scores
As mentioned before, for OWAS and REBA assessment, 17 postures were selected in two
particular tasks: “2-pieces cans’ inspection” and “tops’ inspection”. Table 2 shows the
sub-tasks and respective number of postures selected to be assessed with both methods.

OWAS and REBA methods scored three (17.6%) and ﬁve (29.4%) postures,
respectively, with a high risk (Risk level = 3) of developing MSDs whereas ten pos-
tures (58.8%) were qualiﬁed as of medium risk (Risk level = 2) (Table 3). Therefore,
bearing in mind the OWAS’s and REBA’s results, the risk for the development of
MSDs is present in 76.4% and 88.2% of the sub-tasks/postures assessed (Risk Level 
2). These results indicate that investigation and changes are required as soon as pos-
sible or that further investigation is needed, and changes may be required.
Considering the OWAS results, the three worst postures presenting high risk for
MSDs developing were: Reach the cans for further veriﬁcation, Placing the non-
defective cans in the cardboard at ground level and Grab the sachet with tops to check.
The trunk and the Legs scores are responsible for the 1st sub-task and the last two
sub-tasks results, respectively. These results can explain the complaints concerning the
trunk and legs reported by 53% and 59% of the workers, respectively. When, con-
sidering the REBA results, the worst postures were the same highlighted with the
OWAS method, one of the six postures adopted in Checking can’s defects and one of
the two postures adopted in Transportation of cardboard with cans to the lift platform.
The upper arms score (REBA) was  3 for 58.9% of sub-tasks/postures assessed,
probably because they were ﬂexed between 45° and 90°, sometimes with a slight
abduction or with a ﬂexion higher than 90°. The lower arms score for the majority
(76.5%) of tasks was = 2 which reﬂects the need for operators to ﬂex more than 100°.
The wrist score for the majority (70.6%) of tasks was  2: wrists were in extension
(sagittal plane) of 15° or more (47.1%) and sometimes with a radial or ulnar deviation
(23.5%). The neck scores = 2 for 52.9% of the sub-tasks/postures also indicates a high
proportion of neck frontal ﬂexion above 20°. The trunk scores  2 for 88.2% of the
sub-tasks/postures also indicates a high proportion of trunk frontal ﬂexion above 20°,
sometimes twisted/side bended. The legs scores  2 for 53% of the sub-tasks/postures
also indicates that there was strain on the lower limbs. Only four (OWAS)/two (REBA)
sub-tasks/postures assessed presented a Risk Level of 1 (e.g. an acceptable working
posture- no actions are needed).

Lighting Conditions
The quality control area is equipped with three types of suspended luminaires (each one
ﬁtted with two lamps) with no shielding or diffusion components. Three different lamps
were
identiﬁed:
(Lamp1:CCT = 4000 K;
Lamp2:CCT = 5500 K;
Lamp3:CCT =
6500 K). Table 4 summarizes the number of measuring points on each bench.
The average value, the maximum and minimum values and the uniformity value of
Illuminance measures are summarized in Table 5.

“Anti-fatigue” Mats Study
Three “anti-fatigue” mats (Amat, Bmat and Cmat) were tested with the workers. The main
characteristics of each anti-fatigue mat are summarized in Table 6, as well as the
operators’ opinion after the 1st week of use.

Proposed Solutions
As known, Organizational and Technical solutions involve different costs to the com-
pany. Considering organizational solutions are easier to implement, have short-term
effects, and are affordable for the company we will present them ﬁrst. At the end, some
technical solutions are proposed as well.
Operators should be trained to be aware of their postures and better understand the
MSDs etiology. They should be encouraged to use the means at their disposal such as
gloves, lift platform, anti-fatigue mat and hearing protectors,… Sensitize and train
workers to take an active role in the work situation by proposing improvements and
give opinion about other proposals.

Marks on the pavement should be made to identify the places where the operators
should place benches (they currently place the bench in a random manner). This would
prevent workbenches from being inadequately oriented in relation to the current
arrangement of the luminaires, and minimize light reﬂections. Figure 4 shows the
proposed marks on the pavement (230 cm  70.5 cm), where operators should place
the benches.
Considering the positive impact observed during the “Anti-fatigue mat” testing we
advise the Amat to be acquired for each workstation, with the following dimensions:
200 cm * 40 cm (Fig. 5).
Acquisition and assembly of wheels on the benches would have a positive impact,
since they have to be moved as required. Nowadays, the operators struggle to move the
benches alone.
Acquisition of benches with adjustable height, since it is necessary to adjust the
height of the work surface. The height of the benches should vary between the height of
the worker’s elbow and the height of his shoulder. Accurate measures are not suggested
due to the great diversity of operators and each operator should adjust the working
plane to his own height.
Considering that this is a temporary workstation and there are problems in terms of
acoustic, thermal and lighting environment, a solution to solve these problems was
thought. The solution integrates a metallic structure (Fig. 6) which consists of pillars
and an overhead grid, in which luminaires would be installed, as well as an air con-
ditioning system to control the thermal environment. Since the structure has no walls,
removable panels (Fig. 7) were considered. These panels may all be open, thus forming
a completely covered area. Since it is a temporary workstation, when the panels are in a
corner, the area could be used for other type of tasks and still be tidy.

Conclusions
This study has revealed that the work done in these quality control workstations entails
risks factors for its operators which may be responsible for the development of mus-
culoskeletal disorders and visual fatigue complaints. As a limitation of this study we
can highlight the short case study design which not allowed us to study the inﬂuence of
workstation comfort and risk factors on the incidence of musculoskeletal complaints.

Abstract. To improve the staff interactive relationship and promote the
development of the enterprise, we deliver the questionnaire of “The inﬂuential
factors of staff interaction relationship” to the staff of an enterprise. Soft-
ware SPSS is used to analyze and verify the collected data. The structural
equation model and conﬁrmatory factor analysis are used to study the inﬂuential
factors of staff, and we also use them to analyze the relationship between the
various factors and the level of staff interactive relationship. The result of the
study shows that the overall inﬂuential factors of staff index of this enterprise is
69.8, and it’s in the middle grade. In addition, the communication skills of the
staff and the external environment of the enterprise need to be improved.

Introduction
The interaction of employees refers to the sum total of the interaction between
employees and the exchange of people, objects and environment in the production
activities. Researches show that employee’s sense of belonging, the degree of harmony
between employees and enterprise production safety are closely related to the inter-
action between employees [1, 3].
At present, there are fewer researches on the interaction relationship in the aca-
demic circles. In 1996, Hartline and so on [4] constructed the service staff management
model, and they incorporated the interaction between employees into the research ﬁeld
of service interaction. And then, the researches of interaction between employees
started. Driscoll and Randall [5] thought that in the process of interaction, if employees
get more support and help, they will be more emotional commitment as feedback
and reward. Wilson [6] had found that employees are more likely to share the important
information with their leaders if they have a better interaction with their leaders.

Hupei [7] had found that the interaction relationship has an important inﬂuence on
employee’s satisfaction. Wei Haiying and so on [8] proposed that we can establish a
good employee interaction by the decision-making participation, resource sharing,
organizational synergy and supervision. Other references [9–11] on the study of the
interaction are simple speculative exploration and qualitative analysis of the discussion.
Consequently, in order to deeply study the employee interaction, this paper will study
the impact factors of the interactive relationship from the perspective of people, objects
and environment. The data are collected by compiling and issuing the questionnaire on
the factors affecting employee interaction. This paper builds model though SEM and it
uses qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze the impact of the various factors
on the impact of interaction between employees. Thus, it achieves the purpose of
enhancing the interaction relationship between employees.

Design the Scheme of Investigation
2.1
Design of Questionnaire
On the basis of collecting and sorting a large amount of literature data, using SEM to
analyze the inﬂuencing factors of employee interaction. The inﬂuencing factors of the
interactive relationship are divided into four latent variables, which are personal

attribute, personal accomplishment, communication skills and external environment.
Among them, personal attribute, personal accomplishment and communication skills
are used as endogenous latent variables of the model, and the external environment as a
model of exogenous latent variables. According to the above, nineteen individual
observation variables which may inﬂuence the employee interaction are designed.
Detailed descriptions are shown in Table 1.
The questionnaire is adopted Likert Scale. In terms of measuring scale, the paper
set up three levels of impact. The value of 1 indicates that “low”. The value of 3
indicates that “medium”. The value of 5 indicates that “high”. According to the dif-
ferent indicates of enterprise employees correspond with their own views of the score.
2.2
Determination of Sample Size
The sample random survey is adopted in this questionnaire. A total of two hundred and
thirty-six questionnaires are issued. Among them, two hundred and twenty-ﬁve
questionnaires are received and the effective rate is 95.3%. The survey participants are
local business people, including employees, team leaders and senior management
leaders. The numbers are two hundred and four, ﬁfteen and six respectively. Its dis-
tribution ratio is shown in Fig. 1.
2.3
Reliability and Validity of Questionnaire Data
Reliability of Questionnaire Data
Reliability refers to the degree of stability or consistency of the measurement results. If
the reliability coefﬁcient is above 0.8, we believe that the questionnaire reliability is
high; 0.7–0.8 can be accepted; 0.6–0.7 can be accepted reluctantly and under 0.6 the
questionnaire is not credible. The applicability test of factor analysis by KMO and
Bartley sphere test in SPSS. If the KMO value is above 0.5 and the signiﬁcant level is
below 0.05, we believe that the factor analysis is suitable for the analysis.
From Table 2, we know that the KMO value is 0.818, it more than 0.5. The
signiﬁcant level is 0, it indicates that there is a correlation between the factors and the
model is suitable for factor analysis. From Table 3, we know that the reliability
coefﬁcient of each latent variable all greater than 0.7 in Alpha Cranbach, and it shows
that the design of the model is suitable for measuring items.

Validity of Questionnaire Data
In this paper, the structural equation theory is used to construct the model. The con-
struct validity of the scale is assessed by the model ﬁt of conﬁrmatory factor analysis.
So as the validity of the data is transformed the index evaluation in SEM evaluation.

The Establishment of SEM
3.1
Establishment of SEM Model
We use LISREL software to build the initial model. By using the method of maximum
likelihood estimation, the path coefﬁcients and the coefﬁcients are normalized. The
results are shown in Fig. 2.
3.2
Overall Fitting Evaluation of the Initial Model
The main parameters of X2, df, X2/df, RMSE, CFI, NNFI and IFI are tested to analyze
the goodness of ﬁt of the model [12]. The parameters of each ﬁt of the initial SEM
model are shown in Table 4.
From Table 4, we know the RMSEA and IFI indicators have not met the
requirements, the overall degree of the initial model is not high, we need to further
modify the initial SEM model, and make it more in line with the data reﬂected by the
variable relationship.

Adjustment of the Model
Modiﬁed index method is used to modify the initial model. We select the path of the
MI value is relatively large to adjust, and theoretical analysis according actual situation.
The modiﬁed model path diagram is shown in Fig. 3.
We parameter estimate the modiﬁed model, and we can get the values of the main
parameters. They are shown in Table 5.
From Table 5, we can see that all the goodness of ﬁt indexes of the modiﬁed model
can meet the requirements. It shows that the ﬁtting effect of the modiﬁed model is
better.

Inﬂuence Score of the Factor Index
According to the results of SEM calculation, we can get the score of four aspects of the
enterprise, so as to make a quantitative evaluation of the interactive relationship of the
enterprise. The score of the enterprise is 95 points (19 * 5 = 95), and the score is
divided into ﬁve levels. The ﬁrst level is excellent (85–95). The second level is good
(75–85). The third level is average grade (65–75). The fourth level is up to standard
(55–65). The ﬁfth is not qualiﬁed, the score is less than 55. Though the calculation, the
comprehensive inﬂuence factors of the interactive relationship are shown in Table 6.
Among them, the weight is the load factor corresponding to the observation index.

Model Analysis
(1) The relationship between the latent variables
From Fig. 3, we can see the path coefﬁcients that between external environmental
factor and personal attribute factor, personal accomplishment factor, communication
skills factor are 0.52, 0.66 and 0.82. It shows that there is a positive correlation between
external environmental factor and personal attribute factor, personal accomplishment
factor and communication skills factor, and if external environmental factor increases
1%, it will let personal attributes factor, personal accomplishment factor and com-
munication skills factor increase 0.52%, 0.66% and 0.82%. The path coefﬁcients that
between personal attribute factor and personal accomplishment factor, communication
skills factor are 0.76 and 0.41. It shows that if personal attribute factor increases 1%, it
will let personal accomplishment factor and communication skills factor increase
0.76% and 0.41%. The path coefﬁcient between communication skills factor and
personal accomplishment factor is 0.63. It shows that if communication skills factor
increases 1%, it will let personal accomplishment factor increase 0.63%.

The Exploration and Analysis of the Inﬂuence Factors

(2) The relationship between the latent variables and the observed variables
We analyze the relationship between personal attribute factor and its observed
variables. The coefﬁcient of character (A2) is the largest, the position level (A1)
followed by A2, next is the cultural level (A4) and the expression of the way of
thinking (A8), ﬁnally is the interest (A3). It shows that character has a signiﬁcant
impact on the employee interaction relationship. At the same time, when the enterprise
pays attention to the staff character, it also should help the staff to establish correct
outlook on life and values. On the basis of mutual trust, the enterprise should encourage
employees communicate with each other, so as to overcome the staff’s self-closing
psychology.
We analyze the relationship between personal accomplishment factor and its
observed variables. The coefﬁcient of the work attitude (A5) is the largest, the work
ability (A9) followed by A5, next is the ethics (A6), and ﬁnally is the personal image
(A7). The coefﬁcients of the four observation variables are relatively large, which show
that they have an important impact on the interactive relationship. Therefore, enterprise
managers should play an exemplary role. Firstly, the manager should correct his own
work attitude. Secondly, the enterprise should establish a targeted and practical
supervision mechanism and incentive mechanism, because it can enhance the staff’s
self-control, stimulate the labor and create enthusiasm. Finally, the enterprise should
pay more attention to the development needs of individual employees, adhere to the
“people-oriented” management philosophy and reduce the waste caused by “not
doing”, so as to arouse their working interest and cultivate their positive attitude.
We analyze the relationship between communication skill factor and its observed
variables. The coefﬁcient of the good at understanding other people’s intentions (A13)
is the largest, the good at expressing their own ideas (A11) followed by A13, next is the
good at listening to other people’s expression (A12) and the good at controlling their
own emotions (A10), and ﬁnally is the good at reﬂecting their own mistakes (A14). It
shows that the skill which good at understanding other people’s intentions can urge
communication between employees, and it is more conducive to improving the inter-
action relationship between employees. Enterprise should cultivate employees the
ability of empathy. When employees communicate with each other, they can put their
selves in the position of the other side to think. At the same time, enterprises also need
to cultivate the staff to establish a fair, inclusive attitude and reduce individualism and
autocratic heart. In order to better understand the intentions of others.
We analyze the relationship between external environmental factor and its observed
variables. The coefﬁcient of the democratic communication environment (A15) is the
largest, the complete communication equipment (A18) followed by A15, next is the
smooth communication channels (A17) and the perfect communication system (A19),
and ﬁnally is the relaxed communication atmosphere (A16). It shows that the demo-
cratic communication environment is the basic condition to improve interaction.
Enterprise managers should increase the open opportunity to communicate with the
employees, and fully enhance the interaction between employees and managers. At the
same time, managers should adopt the reasonable suggestions of employees. Managers
and staffs should strengthen the democratic communication environment together.

Conclusion
Through the questionnaire survey of the employees of the enterprise, we use SEM to
explore and analyze the inﬂuencing factors of the employee interaction relation-
ship. We can get the following conclusions:
(1) The impact score of enterprise employee interaction relationship is 69.8, which is
in the medium state. It shows that the overall interaction relationship between
employees in the enterprise is general.
(2) No matter which factor variable is affected, it will affect the other factors and the
level of interaction relationship. We must maintain a high score of each factor, so
as to improve the overall interaction relationship effectively.
(3) The personal attribute factor has the highest score, followed by the personal
accomplishment factor and the external environment factor, and the score of the
communication skills factor is the lowest. In this regard, enterprise should pay
more attention to improve the communication skills of employees and managers.
For instance, when employees communicate with each other, they can put their
selves in other’s shoes, so as to better understand the intentions of others. When
managers communicate with employees, managers can adopt the incentives and
other mechanisms, so as to improve the quality of communication between
managers and employees effectively.

Abstract. The impact of night shift work on workers’ wellbeing and the rela‐
tionship to gender is currently unclear. This study identiﬁes the potential health
impact of night-shift between male and female workers. Ninety workers (M = 45,
F = 45) were surveyed. Males reported being sad and depressed 12% more than
females. Females reported a higher incidence (18% higher) of ﬁnding it more
diﬃcult to sleep after work. Males were 7% more nervous and very ﬁdgety than
females after nightshift work. Females are more likely (8%) than their male coun‐
terparts to “more than usual have diﬃculty making decisions after work.” The
eﬀects of night-shift schedule on both genders demands an immediate interven‐
tion. This study could be a wake-up call for the OSHA to intervene in workers’
schedules.

Introduction
The loss of sleep from time to time is not uncommon, but the consistency of night shift
work can take a toll on a worker’s sleeping pattern and impact their health in a myriad
of ways, if left unchecked. Today many industrialized countries require shift systems of
work, which include working afternoon and night, in order to ensure the functionality
of the system. Shift work is common in the healthcare industry, security, communication,
entertainment and transportation in urban cities (e.g., New York, Chicago, Baltimore
City, etc.). The Institute for Work and Health (IWH) reports that there is strong evidence
that night, evening, rotating and irregular shifts are associated with in increased risk of
occupational injury due to worker’s fatigue, less supervision and co-worker support
during non-daytime shifts. Knowingly and unknowingly shift workers are battling with
problems that require them to ignore their diurnal nature, because their eyes are open to
work at the times they should be closed to sleep. Folkard [1] considered this as desynch‐
ronization of the circadian periodic functions. Folkard perception about human nature
was acknowledged in Costa’s [2] recent study saying, “Staying awake at night and trying

to sleep during the day is not a physiological condition for diurnal creatures such as
humans, who are hence forced to adjust their psycho-physio-logical state by a phase
shift of the daily ﬂuctuation of biological functions, which are normally activated during
the day and depressed during the night. This phase shift occurs at a speed of about one
hour per day and can widely vary according to the duration and extension of night duties
along the shift schedule” p. 2.
According to Costa [3], night shift can increase worker absenteeism and disrupt
female hormonal activity as well as their reproduction function. The Bureau of Labor
Statistics [4] data report showed that nearly 15% of American full time workers work
night shift, rotating shifts, or an arranged irregular schedule, out of which night shift
was amounted to 3.2%. Many American employers do not recognize or understand the
correlation between workers working hours/schedule and their performances. Shift
schedules can be associated with diﬀerent health eﬀects such as cardiovascular disease,
gastrointestinal disease, increased accident risk, disturbed sleep and increased fatigue
according to Åkerstedt [5]. The night shift schedule disturbs physiological rhythms and
the sleep–wake cycle and has been proven to result in problems not only in endocrine,
metabolic, and hormonal systems but also in high blood pressure, high serum triglyceride
and low serum HDL-cholesterol and cerebro-vascular disease [6].
Health and safety impacts of shift schedules have been in a continuous discussion
since 1980’s. Many researchers have worked to assess the various occupational factors
that result in health impacts of night shift [7, 8, 9]. Yet, little to no research has been
done on gender diﬀerences, in this area of study. One reason may be lack of adequate
information on males and females that would lead to valid results because of the diﬀerent
jobs, occupations, and working conditions that are usually found for each gender
working night shifts. Among the few papers found in this area of study that focused on
gender diﬀerences, the outcomes diﬀer. For example, Beermann and Nachreiner [10] in
a discriminant analysis report on the results of a survey on the eﬀects of shift work on
women and men under similar job conditions, gender related eﬀects could not be found.
However, the recent ﬁnding of night shift work and gender indicate diﬀerent eﬀects on
men and women; pointing to a greater impacton women [11]. Paddock’s ﬁnding was
based on a laboratory research, while Beermann and Nachreiner study was on self-
reported worker perception. It has been revealed by quantitative sleep analysis that more
severe eﬀects of night work are found on women, particularly those with children [12].
Tolerance to shift and night work is a complex phenomenon related to several aspects
pertaining to diﬀerent domains dealing with personal characteristics and coping strat‐
egies, family and social conditions, working situations and particularly, working hours
of the organization [13]. Providing data to support gender diﬀerences for male and
female on night shift schedules is still needed, due to the lack of supportive statistical
data on rotating night shift work under comparable job conditions. Meanwhile, the belief
that diﬀerences do exists has kept the eﬀort alive to clearly provide the supporting data
so that workers can receive the beneﬁts that can be made available to them. As such
gender-related eﬀects of night-shift and shiftwork have been of special interest, since
diﬀerent eﬀects for male and female would justify gender-related health and safety
regulations at work. Therefore, this study is conducted to identify the potential health
and life impact of night shift between male and female workers.

Materials and Method
2.1
Participants
The study population for this research included employees that routinely work night
shift at a food processing company, the healthcare industry, a goods producing industry,
a customer (technical) support service company, and a courier service. The companies
are geographically located in mid-west America and central North Carolina. The total
number of workers who participated in the survey were ninety, 45 both males and 45
females. Participants were recruited through the support of the facility’s management
staﬀ along with a support letter from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the authors’
institution. Information informing participants of any risk associated with the research
was written in the informed consent form. Participants were advised to read the consent
form thoroughly and to ask questions, if the need arose, before signing and giving their
consent to participate in the survey. The research protocol was approved by the Univer‐
sity IRB. Participants were grouped into three age group categories (18–34), (35–54),
and (55–74). Participant ethnicities are Black or African Americans, Caucasians, Native
Americans or American Indians, and Hispanics or Latinos with the predominant
ethnicity being Black or African Americans.
2.2
Procedure
Data were collected using a researher-developed questionnaire adapted from a standar‐
dized questionnaire. The questionnaire was reviewed by a group of certiﬁed safety
personnel and psychologist to validate its content. The questions were presented in the
form of yes/no options and a Likert Scale. The yes/no options reﬂected what several
researchers have used [14, 15] to investigate the eﬀects of work schedule on workers.
After the review, the application was submitted to the IRB for research ethic violations
review. Prior to distribution of the questionnaire to various organizations, each facility
was visited to obtain permission.
At each organization, the purpose of the research was explained to the management and
approval was obtained before the questionnaires were released to the employees. In each
organization, a sealed box with a small opening at the top was made available at the recep‐
tion desk for participants to return completed questionnaires without fear of identification
by any member of the management. All reponses were voluntary and anonymous. To
ensure privacy, no names were requested or given by the participant. Each organization
was visited up to three times per month. Questionnaires were attached with the consent
form. After one month in each organization, both completed and uncompleted question‐
naires were collected and were taken to the lab for data compilation.
3
Data Analysis and Results
Data collection of all respondents lasted for approximately six months. Data compilation
was done with the use of Excel ® version 2010. Out of three hundred survey sent out,

ninety-two copies were returned fully completed of which 49% (n = 45) were female
and 51% (n = 47) were male. Ninety responders’ questionnaires were treated in order
to ensure equal distribution in the number of female and male gender participated in the
study; 45 females 45 males. Of the ninety respondents, sixty-ﬁve percent were Black or
African American, 17% were Caucasian, 12% were Hispanic or Latino and 6% were
Native American or American Indian. Approximately 28% of the participants were in
the age group 18–34, 60% were in the age group of 35–54, and 12% of the participants
were in the age group 55–74. Table 1 shows respondents’ ethnicity, age-group and
gender frequency distributions.
Educational levels of all respondents follow a bell shaped curve distribution shown

night shift workers consist of workers with technical and vocational training through a
Bachelors education and peaks at workers with some college credit. The number of night
shift workers with Masers and PD declines signiﬁcantly.
3.1
Health Eﬀects
It is generally understood that the eﬀects of work night shift have a deleterious eﬀect on
sleep. The most work place incidents/accidents happen during night work shift. This is
possible as many might not have had enough sleep during the day and the body biological
clock is being aﬀected at night while working instead of sleeping. One of the ﬁndings
from this study shows that 28% of the respondents experienced poor appetite. Out of
this 28%, ﬁfty-two percent were female and 48% were male. Forty-three percent of the
respondents revealed having diﬃculty sleeping after working the night shift. Of this
43%, ﬁfty-nine percent were female and 41% were male. Overall, females appeared to
be most aﬀected; leading their male counterparts by 18%.
3.2
Fatigue
For questions regarding respondent fatigue (low energy, mental and physical fatigue)
females reported higher incidents of fatigue in two categories than their male counter‐
parts – low energy and mental fatigue. Fifty-one percent of the respondents complained
about low energy level, out of which 45% were male and 55% were female. Mental
fatigue in terms of respondents’ mental concentration revealed that 43% experienced
concentration problems, out of which 59% were female and 41% were male. Thirty-two
of the respondents’ complained of diﬃculty making decision after working the night
shift, out of which 54% were female and 46% were male. Forty-one percent of the
respondents complained of physical fatigue, of which 54% were male and 46% were
female.
3.3
Psychology
Night shift schedules can possibly be a psychosocial stressor. Stress occurs in a situation
under pressure or inability to cope with an incident or stimulus. Twelve percent (eleven)
of the respondents declared to have developed symptoms of unfavorable mental health
while working the night shift. Female respondents were 70% of the population which
made female 40% higher than their male counterparts reporting mental health problem.
Twenty-eight percent of the respondents declared to have being depressed after worked
night shift. Males, 56% of this population; 12% higher than their female counterparts.

Discussion
Many published articles on night shift schedules and over time working hours have revealed
different effects of the schedules on workers well-being and performances [16, 17, 18]. This
study sampled workers who work night shift schedule for at least 3 h daily for at least 5 days
The Eﬀects of Night Shift Schedule
561

in a week and focused on the differences in the night shift effects as experienced by female
and male in workplaces. Findings from this study provide evidence that night shift work is
associated with poor quality of life, low energy, sadness, and depression. Findings further
reveal that female are generally affected by night shift schedule than their male counter‐
parts. The finding that night shift schedule has different health effects on female and male
support Paddock [11] who first discovered that the night shift affects men and women
differently, such that it reduces women cognitive function to perform their daily duties
effectively. Paddock’s study was a laboratory setting study on nurses and police while this
study used surveys to capture the worker perception on the effect of night shift. None of the
respondents of the study is a police man, yet findings are similar. Psychosocial stress and
depression were confirmed by this study, which also agree with [13, 19] studies.
Generally, findings reveal that night shift schedule has greater effects on human circa‐
dian rhythms and as such deteriorate workers’ health and social life, which females are
greatly affected. The findings of this study in general support, the conclusions of previous
studies: workers working night shift schedules are prone to negative health effect [20].
5
Conclusion
Finally, the study findings on night shift schedule support the findings of other studies.
Night shift schedules inhibits human health, social life and well-being in dramatic manners.
Many workers fail to realize that the effects of the night shift are not always manifested in a
short period of time, but are the result of an aggregate of several circadian rhythm disrup‐
tions. The night shift schedule’s adverse effects on workers based on this questionnaire is
comparable to that noticed in a clinical study. The effect of night shift schedule is predom‐
inant in female workers than the male workers. Females that work night shift schedule are
prone to health adverse effects than their male counterparts, simply because their body
systems have been affected by the circadian rhythm disruption. Females who experience
poor appetites are 4% higher than males and 18% higher in sleep difficulty. Female experi‐
ence muscle fatigue easily than the males, this may be due to their body hormone system.
Health wise, females have a higher incidence of mental health problems than do males.
During the course of this study, the researchers experience some limitations, which limit the
number of workers that participated in this study such as difficulty to obtain company
management support. For future study, more attention should be given to workers health and
family relationship such as marriage and friends. This study could be a wake-up call for the
Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to intervene in the night shift
schedule of an organization.

Abstract. Like high risk industries such as aviation and mining, occupational
health and safety issues in the mental hospitals cannot be underestimated. For
instance, although some conceptual and empirical studies have focused on
patient safety in mental hospitals, the safety and health management of nurses in
the mental health sector has largely been ignored. This paper seeks to examine
the relationship between occupational health and safety management and two
work outcomes such as engagement and turnover intention in a large mental
hospital in Ghana. Results of the correlation coefﬁcient indicated a positive
relationship between occupational health and safety and engagement, and a
negative relationship with turnover intention. The hierarchical regression results
revealed a positive inﬂuence of safety procedure and safety leadership on mental
health nurses engagement. In addition, only safety supervision and safety
leadership had negative effect on the mental health nurses’ turnover intention.
Finally, job satisfaction of the mental health nurses moderated the relationships
between safety supervision and safety leadership, and intention to turnover.

Introduction
Unlike hazardous sectors such as aviation, mining, quarrying and ﬁshing, occupational
health and safety (OHS) in the mental hospitals has received less research attention
from both academics and practitioners. In advance countries, the health and safety of
healthcare workers (HCWs) in general are safeguarded through risk assessment,
safe working practices, containment of hazards, usage of personal protective equip-
ments and immunization. However, the case of mental hospitals in Ghana is very
different. For example, mental health nurses who suffer physical injury due to

aggression from mental patients are supposed to cater for themselves with their own
health insurance at a registered healthcare facility or hospital.
In addition, nurses working in the mental hospitals are exposed to various forms of
physical, chemical, biological, mechanical and psychosocial risk factors [37]. Hence,
although mental hospitals provide healthcare facility to mental patients, the health and
safety of healthcare nurses are not guaranteed due to the lack of a comprehensive and
stakeholder focused laws on OHS-related issues. The few scattered pieces of legislation
are not enforced due to prevailing inefﬁcient and costly legal systems. Further, unlike
some developed countries in Europe, North America and part of Asia where OHS laws
have been enacted to guarantee safe and healthful working conditions for working men
and women [17], the case of Ghana is extremely different. For example, in Ghana, with
the exception of some statutes such as the Labour Act, 2003 (Act 651); Factories,
Ofﬁces and Shops Act, 1970 (Act 328); Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1999
(Act 526) and the Ghana Health Service and Teaching Hospitals Act, 1996 (Act 525),
and a number of industry speciﬁc legislations which make provisions for health and
safety at work, there seem to be no detailed piece of law regulating and ensuring the
enforcement of health and safety standards at work. Hence, mental health nurses have
no choice but to engineer their own health and safety measures to ensure their well-
being and quality of life at work.
Available statistics show that 2.3 million workers die each year due to work-related
injuries, and 350,000 of these deaths are attributable to occupational accidents [18].
Besides, the ILO estimates that there are 264 million nonfatal accidents each year. Fur-
thermore, it has been estimated that globally, 3.35 million workers in the healthcare sector
experience percutaneous injuries with a contaminated sharp object every year [32].
Finally, the [40] estimates that healthcare workers in Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean
and Asia average about four needlestick injuries per year. Given the considerable
attention and care provided by nurses to mental patients, the health of such nurses should
not be taken for granted. Moreover, it should not be the responsibility of employers only
but also the wider stakeholder group, including health, work and environment authorities.
Despite the fact that some empirical and conceptual studies on OHS management
have been conducted in diverse sectors such as manufacturing [31], mining [5, 6],
construction [41], oil and gas extraction [8, 27], small and medium-sized enterprises
[23], waste management [10], and wood processing [29], there still remains to be seen a
similar empirical study in the mental health sector (for exception see [21]). This study
is not just timely but also imperative since it seeks to examine the relationship between
OHS management and work-related outcomes in a large mental hospital in Ghana.
Furthermore, it is the ﬁrst study to examine the moderating effect of mental health
nurses’ satisfaction on the relations between OHS management dimensions and
engagement as well as turnover intention in the mental hospitals in Ghana.
The rationale for choosing nurses as participants for our study is because, from an
ethical standpoint, nurses have a direct interest in health and safety issues since they run
the major risks of injury if provisions of the law fails to protect them. To augment the
aforementioned rationale, [19] opined that employees often know more about the
hazards associated with their workplace than anyone else does, as they recurrently work
with them. Finally, [39] also stated that research from many countries demonstrates the
positive beneﬁts of worker participation in occupational health and safety issues.
Occupational Health and Safety Dimensions and Work Outcomes

OHS management is a multidisciplinary concept that inﬂuences both private and
social lives of employees in all spectrums of work [28]. Therefore, the rationale for a
good health and safety management system is to improve work conditions and
employees’ health in the workplace. For instance, apart from the legal obligation, all
organisations have a moral duty to ensure that employees and other stakeholders
affected by the actions and inactions of the organization remain safe at all times and
costs [28]. Finally, in this study we assume [24] description of OHS as a multidi-
mensional construct which includes leadership, facilities/equipment, supervision and
procedure. The main research questions underpinning this study are: is there a linkage
between OHS and engagement and turnover intention? Will nurses’ job satisfaction
affect the nexus between OHS management and work outcomes?
2
Theory and Hypotheses Generation
Drawing on social exchange theory [11], we argue that mental health nurses perception
of OHS management policies and practices will inﬂuence their level of engagement and
turnover intention. However, job satisfaction can also buffer this relationship so much
that the more satisﬁed mental health nurses are with their jobs due to proper OHS
management policies and practices, the more likely they are to be engaged with their
organisation and the less likely they are to quit their organisation. The social exchange
theory is based on the norm of reciprocity, which refers to the tendency of employees to
respond to a beneﬁcial action by returning a beneﬁt and to harmful by returning a harm.
For instance, [11] considers interpersonal relationship from two perspectives, economic
and social exchange. In this context, the social exchange theory helps to explain and
understand the moderating role of job satisfaction among the perceptions of nurses
regarding the relationship between OHS management, employee engagement and
turnover intention.
2.1
Occupational Health and Safety, and Employee Engagement
Occupational health and safety management is imperative because it helps reduce
expenses related to injury and illness among workers like medical care, sick leave [36]
and compensation beneﬁt associated with vicarious liability. Furthermore, [16] stated
that the legal reasons for OHS encompass preventive, punitive and compensatory
effects of regulations that protect employees’ safety and health related issues at work.
Hence, the desire of every organisation is to improve upon the health and safety of its
workers.
Engagement as a construct gained popularity after the seminal work of [20]. Kahn
deﬁned engagement as “the harnessing of organisation members’ selves to their work
roles…” (p. 694). Thus, when employees are engaged, they bring all three aspect of
themselves – cognitive, emotional and physical – into performing their work roles. The
above descriptions of engagement according to [15] show that an engaged employee is
intellectually and emotionally bound to the organisation, feels passionate about its
goals and is committed to live by its values. Hence, nurses who perceive their
566
M.A. Gyensare et al.

workplaces as safe and healthful are more likely to develop a strong sense of passion
and involvement in embarking on their assigned task.
Further, empirical ﬁndings reveal that OHS management is effective in predicting
numerous employee and organisational outcomes. For example, using a sample of 300
woodworkers from a Timber Processing Firm in Ghana, [29] reported a positive nexus
between woodworkers willingness to use personal protective equipments and their
awareness of safety and health implications on their occupation. Similarly, using a
sample of 370 employees from the mining sector in Ghana, [5] found a signiﬁcant
impact of occupational health and safety on affective, normative and continuance
commitment. The authors concluded that management within the mining sector of
Ghana must recognize the fact that workers, who feel healthy and safe in the perfor-
mance of their duties, develop emotional attachment and a strong sense of obligation to
their organisation and are more likely committed to the organisation. Elsewhere in
Spain, [14] found a positive relationship between OHS management and company
performance. OHS management has also been reported as a key factor of a ﬁrm’s
reputation and image among its stakeholders [13].
However, despite the aforementioned studies from Ghana and beyond, there
remains a gap in the literature on OHS management. A careful review of the literature
shows that only a few studies have attempted to examine the relationship between OHS
management and employee engagement in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in the
mental hospitals. For example, [26] opined that organisations invest signiﬁcant efforts
and resources to attract and retain proactive and engaged employees; hence, the need
for empirical research directed at identifying factors that best promote positive
employee attitudes and behaviour in the mental hospitals. Against this background and
the identiﬁed research gap, we propose the following hypothesis.
H1. Occupational health and safety management is positively related to mental health
nurses’ engagement.
2.2
Occupational Health and Safety and Turnover Intention
OHS management in the Ghanaian mental health sector has caught the attention of
health practitioners and other key stakeholders in mental health due to the low interest
among nursing trainees to specialize in psychiatry nursing. This low interest has
emerge due to the various work-related injuries and diseases associated with the sector,
which present a serious and costly problem to healthcare workers in general. Again,
nurses in the mental hospitals also do push for transfers into other areas of nursing
leading to a shortage of nursing staff in the mental hospitals in Ghana.
Although some empirical studies on OHS have been conducted in Ghana [e.g., 2, 4,
5, 8, 29], arguably, few of them have examined the relationship between OHS man-
agement and employee turnover intention. For instance, in an empirical research in the
Ghanaian mining sector, [6] found a negative relationship between the dimensions of
OHS management and employee turnover intention. The authors further argued that
safety leadership and safety facility were the most signiﬁcant predictors of miners’
turnover and hence concluded that safety leadership in particular was crucial in the
Occupational Health and Safety Dimensions and Work Outcomes
567

administration of OHS in an endeavour to lessen turnover in the mining sector.
Besides, [4] opined that OHS encapsulates the mental, emotional, and physical well-
being of employees in relation to the conduct of their work and as such represents a
vital subject of interest that affects both positive and negative employee and organi-
sational level outcomes. Making working conditions healthy and safe in the mental
hospitals is because of the interest of stakeholders particularly employees, employers
and government. However, it is imperative to note that the small number of empirical
studies linking OHS to turnover intention implies a lack of knowledge in the area and
as [30] rightly indicated, a call for more studies is justiﬁable in investigating the
relationship between OHS management and turnover intention in different sectors in
sub-Saharan Africa. In line with this clarion call and the absence of empirical research
on the OHS-turnover intention nexus in the mental hospitals in Ghana, we propose the
following hypothesis.
H2. Occupational health and safety management is negatively related to mental health
nurses’ turnover intention.
2.3
The Moderating Effect of Job Satisfaction
Job satisfaction has received extensive research attention as antecedent, consequence
and a third variable [38]. The earnest desire of every organisation is to encourage
improvements in the safety and health of its workers [33] predominantly in an effort to
enhance their satisfaction, which implies that an important task of every organisation is
to prevent the occurrence of occupational accidents and injuries. For instance, [34] in a
study on healthcare workers found a relationship between leading and lagging indi-
cators of OHS and the moderating impact of middle management safety leadership on
the direct relations between leading and lagging indicators. Similarly, an empirical
study by [13] found OHS management as a major determinant of a company’s repu-
tation and its image among the broad stakeholder groups especially employees. Despite
the presence of some studies [e.g., 5, 14] in the literature on OHS management, little or
no attention has been given to the extent to which occupational health and safety
interacts with job satisfaction to inﬂuence employee engagement. This study, thus,
proposes that proper OHS management policies and practices can increase mental
health nurses’ job satisfaction, which in turn will inﬂuence their levels of engagement
within the organisation. Against this backdrop, we formulate the following hypothesis.
H3. Job satisfaction moderates the positive link between occupational health and
safety and nurses’ engagement.
Furthermore, although the relationship between OHS management and turnover
intention has been established mainly in the mining sector, the extent to which job
satisfaction has a strong contingent effect on this relationship is yet to be established in
the mental hospitals in Ghana. For instance, nurses’ perception of the lack of OHS
management policies in the mental hospitals is likely to trigger frustration, lassitude
and lethargy and ﬁnally increase their intention to quit. Research in the healthcare
sector has shown that bloodborne pathogen exposure (BPE) which sometimes results
568
M.A. Gyensare et al.

from percutaneous injuries (PIs) sustained through needle and other sharp objectives
poses a risk of transmission of HIV, hepatitis B and other pathogens to health workers
[22, 32]. Similarly, [21] studied occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens among
1,624 health workers in Botswana. The authors found that 62% of the HCWs perceived
themselves to be at high risk for bloodborne pathogenic exposure. Therefore, when
these health and safety issues are not properly addressed, it may likely affect the job
satisfaction of nurses, which invariably will increase their turnover intention or request
for transfer into other sectors in the healthcare sector. In line with the foregoing
discourse, we propose the following hypothesis.
H4. Job satisfaction moderates the negative nexus between occupational health and
safety and nurses’ turnover intention.

Method
3.1
Participants and Procedures
This cross-sectional survey drew samples of registered nurses from a large mental
sickbay in Ghana. The rationale for selecting nurses as participants is because, from an
ethical standpoint, workers have a direct interest in occupational health and safety
because they run the major risks of injury if the law fails to protect them. Furthermore,
workers often know more about the hazards associated with their workplace than
anyone else does, because they regularly work with them [19, 39]. Data were collected
from 263 nurses from Accra Mental Hospital. Prior to the data collection exercise, we
explained the purpose of the study and assured the nurses that their participation in this
study was strictly voluntary and that all identifying information would be removed
once the data were coded. In addition, to ensure that we got relevant responses from the
nurses, only those who have worked with the hospital for more than six months were
eligible to participate in the study.
The demographic data of our respondents show that of the 263 registered nurses,
60.4% were female. In addition, they had an average age of 26.23 years (SD = 3.28)
and an average tenure of 4.18 years (SD = 1.98) with the hospital. Furthermore, 72.9%
were single and 27.1% married whereas 72.3% of the nurses had obtained at least a
certiﬁcate.
3.2
Measures
Occupational Health and Safety. Following previous research in Ghana [6, 29], we
examined OHS by considering a 6-item, 4-dimension measure. The four dimensions of
OHS were measured with [24] 28-item Safety Management Perception Questionnaire.
These four empirically distinct dimensions were safety leadership (a = .78), safety
facilities or equipment (a = .79), supervision (a = .76) and procedure (a = .71).
Sample items include “Facilities, equipment and work stations are designed with safety
Occupational Health and Safety Dimensions and Work Outcomes
569

in mind” and “employees are sufﬁciently trained if safety procedures.” Responses were
anchored on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree.
Job Satisfaction. Job satisfaction refers to a pleasurable or positive emotional state
resulting from the appraisal of one’s job or job experience [25]. A 6-item scale by [1]
was used. Sample item included “I am satisﬁed with my job”. The Cronbach’s alpha
reliability was 0.87.
Employee Engagement. Employee engagement was assessed using ISA Engagement
Scale [35]. The ISA engagement scale is a 9-item, 3-dimension measure. The
dimensions are intellectual, social and affective engagement. Following previous
empirical studies, we combined the dimensions to get a composite score of engage-
ment. Sample items included “I focus hard on my work”, “I share the same work values
as my colleagues” as well as “I feel energetic in my work”. The Cronbach’s alpha
reliability was 0.85.
Turnover Intention. Nurses’ turnover intention were assessed using 3-item scale
by [12]. A sample item include “I frequently think of quitting my job”. All items were
anchored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly
agree. The internal consistency score for turnover intention was 0.88.
Controls. Following previous research on engagement and turnover intention [e.g.,
6, 15], we controlled for the effect of age, gender and tenure which could account for a
variation in the outcome variables.

Results
4.1
Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis
Prior to the hypothesis testing, we conducted a conﬁrmatory factor analysis to verify
the ﬁt of our hypothesized model. The ﬁt of the CFA model was evaluated based on
chi-square (v2) goodness-of-ﬁt test and four other ﬁt indices recommended by [9]. The
results of the conﬁrmatory factor analysis show that the hypothesized seven-factor
model had an excellent ﬁt to the data (v2 (278) = 423.42, v2/df = 1.52, RMSEA =
0.04, SRMR = 0.05, NNFI = 0.93, CFI = 0.94, GFI = 0.91). The ﬁt indices indicate a
superior ﬁt to the data as compared to the alternative models presented in Table 1.
Therefore, the hypothesized seven-factor model was used for the hypotheses testing
(Table 3).
4.2
Hypothesis Testing
The hypotheses for the study were tested using hierarchical linear modelling
(HLM) analytical technique. To start with, the correlation coefﬁcient as shown in
Table 2 depict a signiﬁcant positive link between safety procedure (r = 0.29,
p < 0.001), safety supervision (r = 0.18, p < 0.01), safety leadership (r = 0.36,
p < 0.001), safety facility/equipment (r = 0.28, p < 0.001) and employee engagement.
Additionally, a signiﬁcant negative nexus was found between safety procedure
570
M.A. Gyensare et al.

(r = −0.14, p < 0.01), safety supervision (r = −0.13, p < 0.05.), safety leadership
(r = −0.15, p < 0.01.), safety facility/equipment (r = −0.32, p < 0.05) and turnover
intention. Again, mental health nurses job satisfaction was positively related to their
engagement (r = 0.28, p < 0.001) and negatively related to their turnover intention
(r = −0.43, p < 0.001). Finally, a signiﬁcant negative nexus was found between
engagement and turnover intention (r = −0.19, p < 0.001).
Regarding engagement model in Table 3, the HLM shown that after age, gender
and tenure were controlled for, safety procedure (b = 0.13, p < 0.05), safety leadership
(b = 0.24, p < 0.01), and safety facility/equipment (b = 0.11, p < 0.10) contributed
signiﬁcantly to explaining 17% of the variance in mental health nurses engagement.
However, safety supervision did not contribute any signiﬁcant effect on employee
engagement (b = 0.04, p > 0.05). Besides, when job satisfaction was introduced into

Model 3, only safety leadership was a strong determinant of engagement (b = 0.25,
p < 0.001) and accounted for 21% of the variance in the engagement model. Hence,
Hypothesis 1, which sought to examine the relationship between the dimensions of
OHS and nurses’ engagement, was partially supported. Hypothesis 2 stated that OHS is
negatively related to turnover intention. We examined this hypothesis using HLM
approach. Regarding the turnover intention model in Table 3, the HLM result showed
that neither of the dimensions of OHS had a signiﬁcant effect on nurses’ turnover
intention. However, when job satisfaction was introduced into the model, safety
supervision (b = −0.10, p < 0.10) and leadership (b = −0.41, p < 0.05) were deemed
as strong determinants of turnover intention. Thus, Hypothesis 2 was partially
supported.
Again, we examined the moderating effect of satisfaction on the nexus between the
OHS and engagement. Concerning employee engagement model, job satisfaction had a
signiﬁcant effect on nurses engagement (b = 0.22, p < 0.001). However, the interac-
tion effect of job satisfaction and OHS had no signiﬁcant effect on engagement. This
implies that job satisfaction had no contingent effect on the relation between OHS
management and engagement. Therefore, Hypothesis 3 was not supported. Similarly,
regarding the turnover intention model in Table 3, the HLM results under Model 3

revealed that job satisfaction had a signiﬁcant effect on turnover intention (b = −0.41,
p < 0.001). Again, under Model 4 of the turnover intention model, job satisfaction has
a strong contingent effect on the link between safety supervision (b = −0.38, p < 0.10)
and leadership (b = −0.94, p < 0.01) and turnover intention. The amount of variance
explained by the interaction effect was 3% in turnover intention. Hence, hypothesis 4
was partially supported. Figures 1 and 2 present the results of the plotted interaction
effect. Following [3], we conducted a simple slope analysis to show that nurses’
perception of safety supervision and safety leadership are negatively linked to their quit
intention when their job satisfaction has a strong positive effect.

Discussion
The primary objective of this study was to examine the relations between occupational
health and safety management, employee engagement and turnover intention in the mental
hospitals in Ghana. Additionally, the study also looked at the extent to which mental
health nurses job satisfaction moderate the already mentioned relationship. Despite the
fact that some empirical studies have focused on OHS management in the oil and gas
sector [8], timber-processing sector [29] and mining sector [5] in Ghana, our paper set out
to be among the ﬁrst empirical studies to examine OHS within the mental health sector.
Next, results of our study revealed that safety procedure, safety leadership and safety
equipment were signiﬁcant predictors of mental health nurses engagement in Ghana.
However, among these dimensions, safety leadership was the most signiﬁcant determinant
of mental health nurses engagement. This ﬁnding is consistent with [6] who reported
similar ﬁndings in the mining sector in Ghana using turnover intention as their outcome.
Furthermore, results of the HLM showed safety supervision and safety leadership
as strong determinants of nurses’ turnover intention when job satisfaction was high and
vice versa. Finally, our result highlights the relevance of job satisfaction in the nexus
between safety leadership and safety supervision, and turnover intention. Hence, with
appropriate OHS management policy in place that promotes positive working envi-
ronment to safeguard employees from sustaining injuries and illness at the mental
hospitals, mental health nurses will be unwilling to quit their organisation.

Practical Implications of the Study
This study highlights safety leadership and supervision as the most predominant pre-
dictors of employee engagement and turnover intention. It is imperative to indicate that
establishing OHS management policy alone cannot address the health and safety issues
in the mental hospitals in Ghana because the sector requires the need for increased
efﬁciency, quality management and effectiveness of OHS management [10]. For
instance, the positive linkage between safety leadership and supervision and employee
engagement illustrates that promoting an OHS policy through proper monitoring and
supervision will strengthen and energize mental health nurses to work hard towards
achieving the goals of the hospital. To this end, [7] emphasized that engagement occurs
naturally when the wellbeing and safety of workers are the topmost priority of man-
agement in the organisation.
Based on social exchange theory, when leaders demonstrate genuine care and
attention for the health and safety of employees, they are more likely to improve their
sense of belonging to the organisation. Hence, management of the mental hospitals in
Ghana should pay speciﬁc attention to safety leadership and supervision of health and
safety issues of their nurses since engaged nurses are intellectually and emotionally
bound to the hospital, feels passionate about its goals and are committed to live by its
values.
Furthermore, understanding OHS management and turnover intention in the mental
hospitals is imperative since mental health nurses willingness to quit the organisations
has both direct and indirect cost and efﬁciency implications. Promoting a good OHS
policy is an important way to increase workers perceptions of the organisation’s
approach to safety and wellbeing and thus reduce their turnover intention. This implies
that a good OHS management can reduce workplace injury rates as well as employee
turnover intention. Moreover, most accidents and injuries at the mental hospitals are
because of exposure to risk and equipment failure. All of these largely do affect pro-
ductivity, talent management and retention of employees in the mental hospitals. Poor
safety leadership in occupational health and safety management will increase nurses’
turnover intention. Therefore, management in the mental hospitals should engage in
attitudes and behaviours that promotes the safety and wellbeing of its workers.

Limitations and Future Research Direction
This research is not without some limitations. Firstly, the small sample size makes it
practically difﬁcult to generalize the results, and this may have inﬂuenced the results.
The above notwithstanding, the sample size was representative of the mental health
sector in Ghana. Secondly, we were unable to establish causality due to the
cross-sectional nature of the data. The study could not examine whether mental health
nurses perception of the existence of suitable OHS management policy causes them to
be physically, psychologically and emotionally engaged or less likely to quit their
organisation. Furthermore, the paper relied on self-report measures for the data col-
lection, which might result in the issue of common method bias. The direction for
future research is to focus on this line of research by exploring other potential

moderating variables on the effect of occupational health and safety (OHS) manage-
ment on engagement and turnover intention in other sectors in Ghana as well as the
sub-region. Again, this study analysed the moderating role of job satisfaction on the
nexus between OHS management and employee engagement and turnover intention.
However, empirical evidence shows that OHS management affect other outcome
variables such as affective commitment [5] and job performance [10]. Therefore, future
researchers could look at the extent to which OHS management does inﬂuence both
affective commitment and job performance in the psychiatry hospitals with responses
from not only nurses but also administrators, medical doctors and laboratory techni-
cians. Finally, researchers can also establish the causality between the variables used in
our model by adopting more statistically robust and rigorous analytical techniques.

Recommendations and Conclusions
This study examined the moderating effect of job satisfaction in the relationship
between OHS management and work outcomes such as engagement and turnover
intention in the mental hospitals in Ghana. Results of the study show that safety
leadership and supervision were strong determinants of mental health nurses engage-
ment. It was further observed that an absence of a comprehensive OHS policy or law in
Ghana has resulted in a laissez-faire attitude and an unwillingness to go the extra mile
as mental health nurses may not be appropriately compensated for certain injuries or
risks in the absence of clear guidelines or policy. There is therefore the need for the
enactment of an OHS policy or law backed by an efﬁcient enforcement and compliance
mechanism to empower management to safeguard employees from exposure to acci-
dents and injuries in the workplace. By so doing, it will enhance the physical, cognitive
and emotional commitment of nurses in the mental health sector. Our descriptive
cross-sectional study speciﬁes that the social exchange theory may be a suitable
framework for OHS management especially in the mental health sector. Furthermore,
job satisfaction was a salient construct in that it had a strong contingent effect on the
relationship between OHS management and turnover intention. Thus, the more satisﬁed
mental health nurses are with the health and safety policy of their hospitals, the less
likely they are to leave their workplace and vice versa. In conclusion, this is the ﬁrst
study to examine the moderating effect of mental health nurses’ job satisfaction on the
relations between OHS management dimensions and engagement as well as turnover
intention in the mental hospitals in Ghana.

Abstract. In order to reduce the load by improving the posture, it is necessary
to know the load to the lumbar intervertebral disk when patients are in various
motions. In this study, we propose a method to noninvasively estimate the load
of the lumbar disc during motion. In the proposed method, we consider that the
change in the gap between the vertebrae due to the posture change is determined
only by the deformation of the intervertebral disc. And the internal changes are
estimated indirectly by measuring the shape of the lumbar part from outside the
body. And the deformation of the disc is estimated with this, and it will be eval‐
uated as an intervertebral disc load. In this study, a disc load of sneezing motion
was estimated and the load on lumber intervertebral disk during motion could be
estimated with the proposed method.

Introduction
Due to changes in the working environment and living environment, patients who
complain of low back pain have been increasing not only in Japan but also worldwide.
There are various kinds of low back pain, but our study group focuses on intervertebral
disc herniation. Intervertebral disc herniation is caused by movement of vertebrae due
to aging and changes in posture, and then the intervertebral disc will be collapsed. As a
result, the intervertebral disk that plays a role of cushioning material between the
vertebra and the vertebra is deformed, and a part of the tissue jumps out and presses the
nerve, resulting in pain and numbness. It is considered that a cause of pathogenesis of
low back pain such as intervertebral disc herniation in daily is repeatedly performing
heavily loaded motions on the lumber such as coughing, sneezing and holding heavy
objects. Therefore, in order to reduce the load by improving the posture, it is necessary
to know the load to the lumbar intervertebral disk when patients are in various motions.
And we can prevent the low back pain in everyday life.

Nachemson [1], Swedish orthopedist proposed method to measure the intervertebral
disc load. In this method, a pressure sensor is directly inserted into the intervertebral
disc between the third lumbar vertebra and the fourth lumbar vertebra, and the pressure
applied to the intervertebral disc is measured. The result shows that the load of the
intervertebral disc is larger when the body is tilted forward than the normal standing
posture. In this measurement method, it is possible to measure with high accuracy even
during motion because the pressure sensor is directly inserted in the intervertebral disc.
However, this method lacks safety because it involves surgical operations and may hurt
the body. In many other studies [2–5], the joint moment, muscle tension, stress and
others are calculated as an intervertebral disk load from the balance of unstable force as
an external force to the lumbar part by applying reverse dynamics based on a rigid body
link model. In the rigid body link model, the vertebrae is considered as a rigid body and
an intervertebral disc is considered as spring and a damper. But it is diﬃcult to reﬂect
accurate information on actual characteristics of parameters which are important in
calculation and estimation. And it is diﬃcult to secure high accuracy because many
assumptions and constraints can’t be used excluding nonlinearity and anisotropy and
partial modeling can’t consider the inﬂuence from the whole body.
In our study group, we estimate the gap between the vertebrae by considering direct
movement of the lumbar part without using a process that is an unclear factor. As
mentioned above, the vertebrae are suﬃciently rigid compared to the intervertebral disc,
so they can be regarded as rigid bodies. Also, the position of the spinous process rearmost
portion and its movement can be identiﬁed on the back surface because the spinous
process rearmost portion is close to the back surface and only the thin skin is present
between the spinous process rearmost portion and the outside. For this reason, we have
proposed a method [6, 7] to evaluate the load on the intervertebral disc by measuring
the movement of vertebrae constituting the lumbar vertebra in a noninvasive method
from the outside, estimate the gap between the vertebral bodies from the movement. As
described later in Chapter 2, the lumbar part has a curvature. In this study, the load of
the posture during motion is estimated by curve-ﬁtting the shape of the lumbar part to
a quadratic function. In this study, we propose a load estimation method for behavioral
posture that can occur in daily life except for postures with holding heavy objects. In
this proposed method, this time we will consider whether load can be estimated in
sneezing as a posture during motion. We will also examine the eﬀect of the method to
reduce the load on the lumber part, which is recommended in medical institutions. In
the past study about sneezing [8], sneezing behaviors are investigated by calculating
expiration.

Method
Figure 1 shows the structure of the human spine. The human spine is a loose S-shaped
curve when viewed from the side. The human vertebra consists of the seven cervical
spines, the twelve thoracic vertebrae, the ﬁve lumbar vertebrae, the sacrum where ﬁve
are fused and so on. Also, the thoracic spinal system is loosely bent toward the dorsal
side (kyphosis) and the lumbar vertebral system is loosely bent toward the ventral side
Noninvasive Estimation of Lumber Disk Load During Motion
579

(lordosis). Because of this curvature, we can weaken and balance the shock when
walking or running. The spine has an elastic force like a spring as a whole because it
has a well-balanced curve in this way. The load on the lumbar part becomes large when
this curve disappears due to various actions etc.
Fig. 1. Spinal structure
Figure 2 shows an enlarged view of the lumbar system. The gap between the vertebral
bodies on the front side (ventral side) or the rear side (dorsal side) changes when the
posture changes, the vertebra moves, and the intervertebral disc is deformed. In this
study, the change in the gap between the vertebrae due to the posture change is deter‐
mined by the deformation of the intervertebral disc only. Relative load on the interver‐
tebral disc can be derived if we know the change of the gap between the vertebrae when
the posture changes. In this study, the vertebra is regarded as a rigid body because it is
harder than the intervertebral disc, and we focus on the fact that the vertebrae end exists
near the body surface of the back. And we assume that the facet joint of each vertebra
is a pin joint and ignore elastic deformation. Then, the radius of curvature is derived by
curve-ﬁtting the lumber part to the quadratic based on the position coordinates of the
vertebral ends measured from the body surface. In the case of laborless standing posture,
the radius of curvature is small and the gap between the vertebrae becomes wide because
the lumbar part is lordotic, and it has a curvature. Therefore, the load on the intervertebral
disc becomes small. However, the curvature of the lumbar part decreases and the lumbar
part becomes straight when the posture changes due to the forward inclination of the
body. And, the load becomes large because the radius of curvature becomes large and
the gap narrows. It is possible to estimate the load applied to the intervertebral disc by
using the radius of curvature because there is such a relationship between the curvature
radius and the change of the gap between the vertebrae.

Fig. 2. Lumbar system [6]
We describe a method to derive the radius of curvature by approximating the lumbar
part with a quadratic function. Considering the lumbar vertebra as a beam, the approxi‐
mated quadratic function can be regarded as a deﬂection curve. Therefore, if the radius
of curvature is ρ, a quadratic function is y(x), the radius of curvature ρ can be derived
by the Eq. (1).
1
𝜌= −d2y(x)
dx2 .
(1)
From the Eq. (1), the radius of curvature in the lumbar part can be derived because
the right side is a constant. The average change of the gap between the vertebrae is
estimated from the change in the overall posture of the lumbar spinal system by using
the radius of curvature thus obtained. From this change of the gap, the load on the
intervertebral disc can be derived.
Among many methods of measuring the lumbar vertebrae of the body surface, we
use following. In this study, as shown in Fig. 3, a marker is pasted on the skin from the
position presumed to be the end of the vertebra of the back and photographed with motion
capture and obtain the position coordinates of the marker. The radius of curvature of the
lumbar part can be obtained from the Eq. (1) by curving-ﬁtting the position coordinates
of the markers of ﬁve lumbar part among the position coordinates of each marker to a
quadratic function. Once the radius of curvature is derived, load estimation can be
performed by the method [6] which will be described below.
Estimated gaps between vertebral bodies using radius of curvature r. Figure 4 shows
the posture change in two dimensions on the sagittal plane of the lumbar vertebra
consisting of vertebrae. The load estimation method is described in the case the lumbar
part is the lordosis as shown in Fig. 4. A one-dot chain line in Fig. 4 indicates a curve
passing through the joint portion (vertebral joint) of the vertebra. di is the distance from
the position of the joint part to the center of the marker, ei is the distance from the joint
position to the center position of the intervertebral disc (= center position of the vertebral

581

body) and r is the radius of the arc. We consider that di and ei are constant for every
vertebra and use average value. And we consider that di is d and ei is e. Also, it is assumed
that the position where the straight line connecting the markers from the center of the
circular arc intersects with the vertebra does not change due to posture change. wi is
width of vertebral body i at the intervertebral disc center position. And we consider that
wi is constant for every vertebra and wi is w. vi is the length of the vertebra i at the joint
position and similarly vi is v. w and v are constant even if the posture changes because
we assume that the vertebra other than the joint portion is regarded as a rigid body and
the elastic deformation of the joint portion is ignored.
With this assumption, rv is deﬁned from Eq. (2).
rv = r + d.
(2)
As shown in Fig. 4, angle θv corresponding to one vertebra is obtained from Eq. (3)
using rv and v.
𝜃v = 2 sin−1
(
v
2rv
)
.
(3)
This equation shows that as the radius of curvature decreases, the angle increases
and the gap in the vertebral body widens, which means the compressive force decreases.
Conversely, as the radius of curvature increases, the angle decreases and the gap in the
vertebral body which means that the compression force increases.
rw is deﬁned from Eq. (4) in order to calculate the gap quantitatively.
rw = r + d + e.
(4)
Fig. 3. Marker pasting position
582
Y. Suzuki et al.

And the angle θw corresponding to the width w of the vertebral body shown in
Fig. 4 is obtained from Eq. (5) using rw and w.
𝜃w = 2 sin−1
(
w
2rw
)
.
(5)
The angle θ corresponding to the intervertebral disc portion, which is the diﬀerence
between the two angles, is calculated by Eq. (6).
θ = 𝜃v −𝜃w.
(6)
Further, the result is multiplied by the radius rw of the intervertebral disc portion and
δ is calculated by the Eq. (7).
δ = rw𝜃.
(7)
δ can be said to be a variable expressing the length of the arc of the gap portion.
If r0 is the radius of curvature in the unloaded state where no load is placed on the
intervertebral disc, δ0 corresponding to it can be obtained by substituting r = r0 in
Eqs. (2)–(7). The change Δδ of the gap from the unloaded state to the measured state in
the vertebral body is obtained from Eq. (8).
Δ𝛿= 𝛿−𝛿0.
(8)
In the simplest case, the load on the intervertebral disc can be represented by the
change in the gap multiplied by the spring constant. If δ0 is the equivalent spring constant
for k, the load p can be expressed by Eq. (9).
Fig. 4. Parameter on the sagittal plane of the lumbar vertebra (lumbar kyphosis)
Noninvasive Estimation of Lumber Disk Load During Motion
583

p(Δ𝛿) = kΔ𝛿.
(9)
In the case of an upright standing position, if the load p is represented by ps with a
suﬃx s it is expressed by the Eq. (10).
ps = kΔ𝛿s.
(10)
The normalized load ρ is represented by Eq. (11) when normalized with p.
𝜌= k𝛿
k𝛿s
= 𝛿
𝛿s
.
(11)
In this way, the load ratio can be expressed by a change of the gap.
And, in the case the lumbar part is kyphotic, the signs of r, d and e are reversed
because the center of the arc is ahead of the lumbar vertebra. Therefore, if the d is
replaced with -d and e is replaced with -e in the equation relating to the estimation process
developed in the case the lumbar part is in the lordosis, the estimation process in the
lordosis can be used. That is, Eq. (12) may be used instead of Eq. (2) and Eq. (13) may
be used instead of Eq. (4).
rv = r −d.
(12)
rw = r −d −e.

Experiment
3.1
Overview
We investigate whether load estimation is possible by this proposed method in posture
during motion. In this study, we estimate the load of the sneeze motion as the posture
during motion. Sneezing becomes a heavy burden for patients with low back pain, and
it also causes the onset of low back pain. Therefore, assuming that reducing the burden
on the waist when sneezing will prevent low back pain, and we estimate the load when
sneezing with the hand on the wall. This method is also used in the clinical setting. As
the experimental method, we paste the 6 mm-markers at twenty vertebral ends on the
skin, they are two lower parts of the cervical vertebrae, twelve thoracic vertebrae, ﬁve
lumbar vertebrae and one upper sacrum as shown in Fig. 3. And the position coordinates
of the marker is obtained by photographing with using six motion capture. The sampling
frequency in this experiment is 100 Hz, and 6 Hz ﬁlter processing is performed on the
data on the position coordinates of the obtained marker. The position coordinates of
markers of ﬁve lumbar vertebrae are used to estimate the intervertebral disc load.
In this experiment, we video recorded for 8 s. And three male subjects in 20's were
asked to sneeze twice at standing posture, ﬁrst time was usual sneezing and second time
was sneezing while holding hand against the wall as the prevention posture. The subject
experiment was approved by the Kochi University of Technology Ethics Review
Committee.

Result
Not only intervertebral disc load but also acceleration was derived in order to know the
body movement during sneezing. Acceleration is obtained by second order diﬀerentia‐
tion of the position coordinates of the marker. This time, the acceleration in the x axial
direction (front and back direction) and the y axial direction (vertical direction) of the
marker of the sixth cervical vertebra, which is the marker closest to the head, was
derived. Figure 5 shows the acceleration during sneezing motion and the estimation
result of the load of one subject when sneezing and sneezing while holding hand against
the wall.

The graph (a), (c), (e) in Fig. 5 show the result of the usual sneeze, and the graph
(b), (d), (f) show the result of sneezing while holding hand against the wall. (a) and (b)
show the intervertebral disc load normalized with the load of the standing posture

immediately after the start of measurement taken as 100, and expresses the load ratio at
each elapsed time. (c) to (f) represent the acceleration, (c) and (d) the acceleration in the
x-axis direction (front-rear direction), and (e) and (f) the acceleration in the y-axis
direction (vertical direction). Also, in (c) and (d), the forward direction and in (e) and
(f), the upward direction are positive. The subject sneezed in about 1.5 s in the graph
(a), (c), (e) and sneezed while holding hand against the wall in about 3.5 s in the graph
(b), (d), (f).
It is understood that the load in (a) and (b) increased at the time of sneezing. And it
is understood that the load when sneezing while holding hand against the wall is smaller
than the usual sneezing. Likewise, for the other two subjects, the result was that the load
when sneezing while holding hand against the wall was smaller. It is understood that
the accelerations in (c) to (f) also increased at the time of sneezing. And it is understood
that the acceleration when sneezing while holding hand against the wall is smaller than
the usual sneezing.
3.3
Consideration
We found that the change in posture is related to the large intervertebral disc load during
sneezing. In the graph (a), the time when the load was the largest was 1.32 s. And
Fig. 6 shows the state of 20 markers pasted to the back of the initial posture and in this
1.32 s. In the ﬁgure, the left is the dorsal side and the right is the ventral side. And, ﬁve
markers with red color are markers of ﬁve lumbar parts. The horizontal axis of the ﬁgure,
the x-coordinate is the front-rear direction, the vertical axis, and the y-coordinate is the
vertical direction.
Fig. 6. State of the marker at the time of sneezing motion
From Fig. 6, it shows that the posture greatly changed when the greatest load
compared to the initial posture, and the entire spine is not S-shaped. Focusing on the
lumbar part, it can be seen that the lumbar part in initial posture is the lordosis, whereas
at the time the load is the largest, it is the kyphosis. Experiments performed by
586
Y. Suzuki et al.

Nachemson have shown that the load is small in the standing posture. It can be seen
from the initial posture of Fig. 6, the lumbar part is lordosis and the entire spine is S-
shaped at the standing posture which is the small load. And it is considered that the load
is large when sneezing because lumber part becomes kyphosis, the entire spine is not S-
shaped, the curvature of the lumbar part decreases, the radius of curvature increases, the
intervertebral disk collapses and the gap between the vertebrae narrows.
Next, thinking about having reduced the load at the time of sneezing by holding hand
against the wall. It is considered that the angle of forward tilt of the body at the time of
sneezing is related to a factor of the diﬀerence the load size when sneezing and sneezing
while holding hand against the wall. Figure 7 shows the state of 20 markers pasted to
the back at the time the largest load when sneezing and sneezing while holding hand
against the wall.
Fig. 7. State of the marker at the time of the heaviest load during sneeze motion
It is can be seen that the angle of leaning forward when sneezing is larger than when
sneezing while holding hand against the wall. From this, it can be considered that the
load becomes smaller than the usual sneezing by holding hand against the wall because
the angle of forward inclination of the body at the time of sneezing becomes small and
the curvature of the lumbar part is kept. Focusing on the markers of the ﬁve lumbar
vertebrae, in the left ﬁgure, it is kyphosis, whereas in the right ﬁgure, it is lordosis. And,
in the left ﬁgure, the marker pasted from the cervical vertebra to the sacrum is like one
arc. In general, the thoracic vertebra is kyphotic, the lumbar part is lordotic, and the
whole spine is depicting a gentle S shape. And, It is considered that the load became
large by collapsing the intervertebral disk and becoming the gap between the vertebrae
narrow because the radius of curvature of the usual sneezing in which the entire spine
is an arc becomes larger than the sneezing while holding hand against the wall in which
the lumbar part remains the lordotic.

Conclusion
In this study, we proposed the method to noninvasively evaluate the load on the inter‐
vertebral disc by measuring the shape of the lumbar part from the outside indirectly and
estimating the change of the intervertebral disc. And, the load on the intervertebral disc
Noninvasive Estimation of Lumber Disk Load During Motion
587

was estimated by deriving the radius of curvature by curve-ﬁtting the body surface shape
of the lumbar part to a quadratic function because the lumbar part depicts a curvature.
In this paper, an estimation experiment of the intervertebral disc load during motion
was performed. The load of sneezing motion as a posture during motion was estimated.
From this experiment, it was obtained that the load in the sneezing time zone became
large, and the load when sneezing while holding hand against the wall was smaller than
the usual sneeze. The posture of the entire spine and acceleration during the sneezing
motion were derived to investigate the factors that resulted in such a result. As a result,
it was understood that the forward angle of inclination and acceleration of the body at
the time of sneezing are reduced by holding hand against the wall. Therefore, discussion
with the clinic is necessary, but as one of methods to reduce the load on the lumber when
sneezing, we consider that it could be quantitatively shown that a method of sneezing
while holding hand against the wall by this proposed method is eﬀective.
From the above, the load on lumber intervertebral disk during motion could be esti‐
mated with the proposed method.

Abstract. Tourist drivers belong to a category of drivers that are more vulnerable
to road accidents due to their unfamiliarity of the road network at a destination.
This paper presents a method followed to develop a tool that alert tourist drivers
of their accident risks based on situational factors obtained from mobile phone
sensors and knowledge distilled from historical records of traﬃc accidents. The
knowledge necessary for the development of a context aware mobile accident
warning application was extracted from a spatiotemporal analysis of historical
accidents data, to identify patterns of conditions that lead to accidents. Results
from this analysis were used to develop heuristics rules that were programmed in
a mobile application. The developed system warns travelers of possible threats
on the road network of Nicosia, given driver’s location and situational factors.
The system aims to improve tourists’ safety.

Introduction
About 1.25 million people die each year because of road traffic crashes and millions
more are seriously injured [6]. Among these casualties a high percentage are
tourists. Increase in tourism related activities yielded increased tourism-related casu‐
alties, with vehicle crashes being the most common cause among tourists’ injuries
[14]. According to the literature, vehicle crashes is the most common cause of injury
for tourists [3–5, 10]. Tourist drivers most of the times are not aware of possible or
even known road-hazards, and hence are more vulnerable to accidents. Poor knowl‐
edge of the road network and local traffic rules, in combination with insufficient
driving skills increase accident risk [15]. Therefore, tourists could have an increased
likelihood for traffic accidents [14].
From a data mining perspective, there is a number of approaches to accident detection
and prediction. These can be divided into: predictive and descriptive techniques [16,
26]. Descriptive techniques looks at historical data for insight, while, predictive use
models and forecasting to understand the future. Some descriptive techniques use cluster
analysis to divide heterogeneous data into several homogeneous classes or clusters [17]

and subsequently ﬁnd patterns in these classes. This paper presents a combination of
descriptive and predictive analysis of historical traﬃc accidents, occurred between 2004
and 2014 in Cyprus, to identify black spots using SOM Artiﬁcial Neural Nets (ANN)
on the road network and subsequently distil patterns within each black spot. The heuristic
rules that were mined from the patterns are utilized for the development of a mobile
accident warning application to alert tourist drivers of imminent risks. The application
utilizes prior knowledge, in combination with real time situational factors obtained from
the tourist’s mobile device sensors.
The paper is organized as follows. Firstly, a review of the literature is presented
followed by an overview of the methodology. Subsequently, the steps followed to clean
and pre-process the accident data are explained, along with the application of a SOMs.
The underlying theory of SOM is presented and the SOMs’ results are explained. Next,
the application of association rules to identify patterns in each cluster is described and
the use of the elicited heuristic rules for the development of a mobile application for
tourists. The paper concludes with a summary and future directions.

Related Work
A signiﬁcant amount of research is conducted in the area of accident forecasting using
data mining, to invent accurate mechanisms for accident prediction [20]. In our previous
work [9] we combined Bayesian Networks with a Dynamic Traﬃc Assignment Simu‐
lator to identify black spots in Nicosia-Cyprus. This paper is a continuation of that work
and concentrates on the application of clustering and association rules, for the identiﬁ‐
cation and analysis of accident black spots. Similarly, Sun [8] proposed a method for
real-time accident prediction using a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) to handle
spatiotemporal time-series crash data in combination with traﬃc data (speed, ﬂow and
occupancy) collected from highways in Shanghai in China. Their DBN achieved a crash
prediction accuracy of 76.4% with a false alarm rate of 23.7%.
Clustering methods is a type of Data mining techniques that are important in iden‐
tifying groups of records which are characterized by common features. Hence, groups
items together on the basis of similarities or dissimilarities [22], and has been used
extensively for market segmentation [19]. Despite the fact that statistical models have
been widely used to analyse road crashes, certain problems may arise when analysing
datasets with large dimensions [21]. In such cases data mining is used that extract
implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful information from large amounts of
data [23]. When dealing with a large and complex datasets, the use of data mining
methods seems particularly useful to identify the relevant variables that make a strong
contribution towards a better understanding of accident conditions.
In traﬃc analysis, applications of SOM include but not limited to, work by [2] that
combine cluster analysis, regression and GIS to assess the risk of traﬃc accidents. Work
by Pei Liu [10] also utilize SOM in combination with Data Mining (DM) models to
analyse liability attributions of car accidents. Their developed Decision Support Tool
uses previous similar crash cases, to assess compensation attributions for insurance
592

companies. Their DM model achieved a 65% accurate authentications for rear collisions
and 73% and 82% for frontal and side collisions respectively. The decision support tool
they developed, appeared to provide helpful information for similar collision cases. On
the same vein, work by Alikhani [11], used a hybrid approach of clustering and classi‐
ﬁcation methods to check if the pre-clustering of data can improve the accuracy for
classifying the severity of road accidents. They used K-means and SOMs for clustering
and ANN with Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference for classiﬁcation. Their results showed
that pre-clustering improved the results’ accuracy. In all combinations of the above
methods, the hybrid model accuracy was higher than using individual classiﬁcation
methods, with the highest accuracy being achieved by pre-clustering data using SOM,
followed by a classiﬁcation model using ANN. Another study by Kassawat [12], also
engage the problem of identifying potential accident prone locations on a map, based
on user input. They developed an interactive web based system that used an integrated
Poisson Regression model and a Multi-attribute Decision Making tree based on the
Decision Expert approach. The developed system allowed the user to enter weather and
time information through an application interface, and produced as output a Google Map
depicting points on a map that were at risky. Each point was categorized in 3 levels of
risk namely, green for low risk, yellow for moderate and red for high risk. In another
related work, Hoon Kwon [13], used data from California Highway Patrol to compare
two classiﬁcation methods, Naïve Bayes and Decision Trees, to reveal the relative
importance of the risk factors with respect to accident severity. The Naive Bayes method
did not consider dependencies among the risk factors, whereas decision trees did. They
used two scoring algorithms to rank the risk factors and their results showed that Deci‐
sion Trees outperformed the Naïve Bayes model, concluding that dependencies among
risk factors are important. Work by Miao Chong [7], compared the performance of ANN,
Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines to predict injury-severity of accidents.
Their results shown that combination of machine learning techniques yields better
results. Speciﬁcally, the hybrid Decision Tree-ANN outperformed the other two
approaches.
Based on the literature, it is evident that combination of techniques seems to outper‐
form single method approaches. Hence, the method proposed herein utilizes two
machine learning techniques aiming to ﬁrstly identify the main clusters of traﬃc acci‐
dents in Nicosia using a combination of input parameters, and subsequently to pinpoint
the factors that signiﬁcantly aﬀect accidents for each cluster. The knowledge distilled
from this process was used to develop an accident prediction model that embedded in
an application, used to inform tourists of possible accident risks on a real-time basis.

Data Analysis Methodology
The purpose of this study was to analyse historical road accidents data from the Cyprus
Police, to identify black spots on the road network of Nicosia and subsequently to
discover patterns that describe causes of accidents. The methodology followed is
diagrammatically depicted in Fig. 1. The main steps in the process include the integration
of accident data with traﬃc ﬂow data from a traﬃc simulator as per our previous work
Mining Traﬃc Data for the Development
593

[9]. Subsequently, pre-process the resulting dataset to eliminate outliers and reduce the
dataset’s dimensionality as explained next. Finally perform cluster analysis and asso‐
ciation rules extraction on the clusters that emerged. The distilled knowledge was
utilized to specify the heuristic rules for the tourist accident warning application decision
engine.

Data Pre-processing
The original accident dataset contained 21179 accident records occurred in Nicosia,
Cyprus between 2004 and 2014. An accident record contains 47 variables, each asso‐
ciated with multiple attributes. The variables are categorized in the following groups:
environment, infrastructure, driver and vehicle. Pre-processing and data transformation
was performed to reduce the dataset’s dimensionality and convert the data in the desired
format based on the rules of Table 1. These rules have been speciﬁed by a traﬃc safety
expert. The study focused on the town of Nicosia, hence the data was selected accord‐
ingly from the original dataset.
During pre-processing no missing values were identiﬁed, but some outliers
(extremely high speed and traﬃc ﬂow) were discovered and were excluded from the
dataset. Four accident types were available, namely, fatal, serious, light injuries, and
damage-only. The last two types were merged into one, so three types of accidents were
used. Accident time was converted into time interval variable as shown in Table 1.
Accident-point was only used to identify the geolocation (coordinates) of accidents as
described later in map-matching Accident data.

Map Matching Accidents to Geolocation
Due to the unavailability of the geospatial coordinates of all accidents’, the accident data
had to undergo processing and map-matching onto a GIS system. The original dataset
as was obtained from the Police, was plotted on a hardcopy map divided into squares
and populated with accident locations. Hence, it had to be converted into an electronic
form to enable its processing. Speciﬁcally, a variable X in the dataset, encoded the
X/Y coordinates of the accident on the hard-copy map. The ﬁrst letter and the subsequent
two digits of X corresponded to a square on a map, while the last two digits to the road-
link in the matching square, where the accident occurred. To avoid manual entry of each
individual accident on the GIS system, accidents were grouped according to the box
they belonged based on their XY coordinates. For instance, for an accident with X value
of ‘M1201’, the last two digits were ignored and the accident was assigned a new value
Mining Traﬃc Data for the Development

of ‘M12’ representing the id of the box on the map. To achieve that, we used Google
Earth to geotag the GPS coordinates of each box from the original hard copy version of
the map. To do that the two end points of each square were used. The upper left and
lower right corner that formed the diagonal of each box. This was done for all boxes on
the road network, resulting in the map depicted in Fig. 2. Subsequently, the coordinates
were exported from Google Earth in a KML format and imported in ArcMap from where
it was again exported in an.xml format and subsequently converted in excel format. In
order to make consecutive work easier, we used the coordinates of the midpoint of the
diagonal of each square, as the coordinates of each box.
Fig. 2. Map of Nicosia overlaid with tags of centroids of the segmented road network. ArGIS
map with cancroids for each accident box (right)
To do this we added the longitude and latitude coordinates that described the two
diagonal corners of each square and divided these by 2. This yielded one set of coordi‐
nates for each square and for the accidents that falls within that square. Finally, an
algorithm was devised in MatLab to assign each data-point from the pre-processed
dataset to its corresponding box. Accidents that fallen outside the modelled map boun‐
daries were ignored. The resulting number of accidents modelled using this coordinate
system was 13327.
To enhance accident records with traﬃc ﬂow information at the time of the accident,
ArcMap was also used. Essentially, mapping accident location with the road link on a
simulation model and from there retrieving the traﬃc ﬂow for that link at the time of
accident. The source was the shape ﬁles provided by our previous work [9]. Shape ﬁle
is a common data ﬁle format for GIS software and it is stored as a set of related ﬁles. It
can spatially describe features like points, lines and polygons that may represent roads,
rivers, lakes etc. The graphical representation of the shape ﬁle with the overlaid centroids
of each of the squares is depicted in Fig. 2.

Self-organizing Maps
Clustering is used in market segmentation [18] to provide a conceptual view of hetero‐
geneous markets [19]. Numerous clustering methods exist that are divided into hier‐
archical and partitioning techniques i.e. DBSCAN, Expectation Maximisation, K-
means. The latter however was criticised in accurately detecting clusters when these do
596
A. Gregoriades et al.

not have spherical shape [24]. All these techniques lack appropriate visualisation meta‐
phors. On the contrary, SOM provides the analyst with an intuitive visualisation that
enables the interpretation of its results. Essentially, SOM is a special case of Artiﬁcial
Neural Networks used for identifying patterns to cluster data by identifying common
features. SOM produces a low-dimensional representation of the input space of the
training data, called a map and belong to the category of unsupervised competitive
learning algorithms for which, no human intervention is required.
The general idea of a SOM is to take an input matrix N × M of N variables and M
occurrences of each variable, and parse it into the SOM topology (usually a two dimen‐
sional grid or map). Using a neighborhood function, neurons organize themselves
forming clusters on the output SOM topology. In SOM algorithm, the output neurons
compete between themselves against the characteristics of an input vector that describe
the variables of the problem. Only one neuron is activated at any given time during a
SOM process cycle. The activated neuron is called the winning neuron (or Best Matching
Unit - BMU). Hence, each occurrence of the variables-set (also called input vectors) is
eventually assigned to a cluster. Input vectors that are similar are grouped into clusters
on the output SOM topology. To achieve this competition, there are feedback paths
between the neurons which in return force neurons to organize themselves. The aim in
SOM learning is to cause diﬀerent parts of the network to respond similarly to certain
input patterns.
Each neuron is a node on the network and is associated with a weight vector that
describes its similarity to the input vector. Every node of the SOM is examined to identify
the one whose weight is most similar to the input vector. The BMU is the most similar
to the input vector. The input data X is parsed into an M = [m1, m2] topology as shown
in Fig. 3. Each cell of the input vector X(n) is fully connected to all nodes of M. The
lines connecting the input vector with the output topology represents a weight vector
W(n, k) and have the same dimension as the input vector. W(n, k) speciﬁes the connec‐
tion weights between the input X(n) and the neurons k in the output topology O(k).
Essentially SOM converts a high dimensional input Space X(n) with n input vectors and
m Variables into a low dimensional output space (SOM topology) O(k) as illustrated in
Fig. 4.

Fig. 4. SOM sample hits plot and neighbour weight distances for accident type and gender (top

The Input Data is parsed to the SOM topology O (k) as shown below. Each occur‐
rence of the Input Space X (n) is fully connected to all nodes of O (k). The lines
connecting the input vector with the output topology represents a weight vector W (n,
k) of the same dimension as the input vector that speciﬁes the connection weights
between the Input X (n) and the neurons k in the output topology O (k) [13].
The algorithm used in SOM is the following: ﬁrstly initialize the connecting weight
vectors of neurons with random values. Then, a vector X(i) from the input accident
dataset is randomly chosen and presented to the SOM topology. The weights of all
neurons of the topology are examined to ﬁnd the ones that are closest to the input vector-
BMU. The neuron which is closest (distance) to the input vector wins the competition.
The neighboring nodes’ weights are adjusted so that they get closer to the input vector.
The change of the weights of the neighboring neurons depend on how close they are to
the winning neuron. The process is repeated for number of epochs (iterations) speciﬁed
by the user. To determine the BMU, the most common method is to calculate and
compare the Euclidean Distance of each and every neuron’s weight vector and compare
it with the randomly selected input vector. The neuron that has the smallest Euclidean
Distance from the Input vector is the BMU.
Matlab’s Neural Network Toolbox was used to run the SOM analysis on the accident
dataset. A 15 × 15 SOM Topology was used to give ﬂexibility to the algorithm to clearly
598
A. Gregoriades et al.

create the desired clusters. The algorithm run for 1000 epochs. All combinations of
variables were used during SOM analysis. All variables were speciﬁed in accordance to
accidents’ geospatial coordinates.
A limitation of SOMs is the ability to handle all types of variables the same way.
Attributes of numerical and ordinal type can be placed in an ascending or descending
order. So, Euclidean distance works ﬁne on these data. That is not the case with cate‐
gorical data. Categorical data can be grouped but cannot be placed in order. For example
hair color. It can take many values: black, brown blond etc. but these values have no
natural ordering and no meaningful ‘distance’ between the categories. So it would not
make any sense to assign black = 1, brown = 2 and blond = 3 and pass it into a SOM
as input. The reason is that black would be closer to brown and farther from blond which
is not the real case. The recommended way to include categorical values in Matlab is to
use the 1-of-N encoding [9]. This method transforms the categorical variables into
dummy binary indicator variables. For example hair color with attributes black, brown
and blonde can be converted as shown in the Table 2.
Table 2. ‘1-of-N’ Encoding
X1
X2
Black

X1 and X2 are the dummy indicator variables. X1 has value 1 for the Brown category
and 0 elsewhere, X2 has value 1 in Blonde category and 0 elsewhere. Black category is
represented with the value 0 in both indicators. Together these two dummy variables
represent all three categories of black, brown and blonde. In our case, the categorical
variables were ﬁrst transformed using the ‘1-of-N’ encoding as explained above.
To ﬁnd the combinations of variables that yield signiﬁcant clusters with regards to
accident occurrence, a permutation algorithm was used that created executed a SOM for
all possible combinations of input variables and dependent variable Accident_Type.
Thereafter, the SOM output plots from each run was analysed to identify the most
important sets of variables based on hits and signiﬁcance plots for further causal analysis.

Results
A subset of the clusters that yielded from the analysis are depicted in Figs. 4 and 5. The
“SOM Neighbour Weight Distances” depicts the distances between the neighbouring
neurons. Grey dots represent the neurons (clusters), while red lines connecting neigh‐
bouring neurons and the colours that surrounds the red lines represent how similar a
neuron is to its neighbour. Dark colours represent large distances between neurons which
indicate dissimilarity and lighter colours represent closer distances which indicate simi‐
larity. Continuous lines with dark colours (borders) indicate that the network has
segmented inputs into groups of clusters where each group has diﬀerent features. The

“SOM Hits plot” indicates how many instances (vectors) of the input data are associated
with each neuron (cluster centre), as well as the neuron location.

Accident Type and Gender, analysis from the ‘SOM Sample Hits’ plot in Fig. 4,
depict 3 large cluster with IDs 6, 69 and 72 having 601, 682 and 1756 hits respectively.
The ‘SOM Neighbour Weight Distances’ plot clearly shows all clusters created. Cluster
6 with 601 hits (18%) represent serious injury accidents in which males were involved.
Cluster 69 with 682 hits (20.4%) show light injury accidents in which females were
involved. Cluster 72 with 1756 hits (52.8%) show light injury accidents in which males
were involved. Also in cluster 1 with 213 hits (6.4%) show serious injury accidents in
which females were involved. It is clear that, the number of males involved both in
serious and in light injury accidents is nearly three times the number of females.
Accident Type and Lighting analysis from the ‘SOM Sample Hits’ plot in Fig. 4,
depict four large clusters with IDs 7, 21, 61 and 84 with 305, 465, 813 and 1533 hits
respectively. The ‘SOM Neighbour Weight Distances’ plot in Fig. 4 show how the clus‐
ters were formed for this SOM. Cluster 7 with 305 hits (9%) show serious injury acci‐
dents occurred with night street-lit. Cluster 21 with 465 hits (13.9%) show serious injury
accidents occurred with day light. Cluster 61 with 813 hits (24.4%) show light injury
accidents occurred in night street-lit. Cluster 84 with 1533 hits (46%) show light injury
accidents occurred with daylight. More than half of all accidents of accidents occurred
in day light and this supports the results of Accident Type and Accident Time above,
where most light accidents occur between 09:00 and 18:00.

Patterns Identiﬁcation
To identify patterns in each black spot, the accident records that belong to each black
spot were extracted from the original dataset and stored in separate data-ﬁles. Subse‐
quently, an Association rules algorithm was used to identify patterns in each data-ﬁle.
The main approaches are: Apriori, Eclat and FP-Growth [26]. The association rules
algorithm used is the Apriori algorithm [1] since it has been considered the most eﬀective
and eﬃcient for ﬁnding frequent item [25]. The Apriori algorithm uses the support and
conﬁdence measures to generated valid association rules. Support is the percentage of
instances of records in the dataset for which a pattern (rule) is true. For example the
600
A. Gregoriades et al.

support for the association rule A->B is the total number of instances containing both
A and B divided by the number of total instances of the dataset. Conﬁdence is the level
of certainty that describes each discovered pattern. For example the conﬁdence for the
rule A->B is the number of instances containing both A and B divided by the number
of instances containing A.
The rules that emerged form the association rules, highlight the importance of
gender, age, day of the week, time, traﬃc control, and distractions such as road works,
bus stops and bad weather on accident occurrence. Hence, for the black spot in question,
the mined rules highlight that, most accidents arise by younger male drivers, at the
signalized intersection of the black spot. The eﬀect of bad weather, bus stopping or
having to diverse due to road works has also a negative eﬀect on accident risk. Mined
rules for each black spot are stored in a rules repository associated with the geolocations
of the black spot. The application depending on the GPS location retrieves from the
repository the rules that match its coordinates and the characteristics of the driver and
present the risk through the user interface. Therefore, drivers that use the application
can be warned of diﬀerent type of accidents that are more likely to occur, given their
spatiotemporal, genotype properties, and environmental conditions. At ﬁrst instance the
application does not utilise the driver’s speed. This can be easily retrieved from the
mobile’s build in sensors.
To enhance the validity of the study, mined rules have been conﬁrmed by 2 traﬃc
safety experts that veriﬁed their rationality. These rules are used as the basis for the
development of a prototype prediction engine of the mobile accident warning system.
Essentially, given the characteristics of the driver, such as: age and gender, and in
combination with information regarding the day, time, weather conditions and gps coor‐
dinates, the application ﬁshes out of its database the rules that apply to that situation and
accordingly warns the driver.

A Software Application to Supports Tourist Drivers
The main usage of the application is to warn tourist drivers of imminent risk on the road
network of Nicosia. The application utilised the build-in capabilities of mobile phones
to recognise geolocation and travelling speed, and accordingly in combination with
information regarding time and day of the week, analyses the risk and present the user
with possible warnings. For the system to be able to warn drivers it was essential to
create a spatiotemporal analysis of the black spots on the road network of Nicosia. This
prerequisite the development of a temporal heat-map using the historical data as
described previously.
For the generation of the accident black spots heat-maps, we utilised the Fusion-
Tables tool provided by Google. The pre-processed data was analysed using SOM and
the output for each input set was imported into the tool to create a series of heat maps
for all combination of variables, for the Nicosia network. Geolocation data was used as
input, along with accident related information. The black spots on heat maps are iden‐
tiﬁed using the neighboring distances matrix and hits plot. These designate geographical
locations with large number of hits (counts) compared to other locations. The clusters

identiﬁed with SOM, for all combinations of input datasets, were imported in fusion-
tables to create a series of heat maps. Each map was associated with a set of features
that describe the situations i.e., age of driver, day, time etc. These associations were used
in the developed Matlab application, to visualise the results according to user properties.
Speciﬁcally, the Matlab Graphical User Interface Design Environment (GUIDE) was
utilised to create the application interface. The applications was created in the form of
a package and an installation wizard, which enables a third party user to download and
install a free Matlab Runtime Environment (MRE), to run the application. An illustration
of the interface of the developed application is depicted in Fig. 5, which shows the heat
map for young drivers associated with light crashes. Diﬀerent SOMs, and their associ‐
ated heat maps are utilised by the application depending on the features entered by the
user, regarding the driver characteristics. Properties that refer to the environment are
dynamically inferred from the situation such as: the day, time and weather conditions.

Conclusions
In this study, we demonstrated the use of SOM for the analysis on traﬃc accident data,
which were then used to identify the black spot for the city of Nicosia. These were
subsequently analysed using association rules to identify patterns that were used to
specify rules for an application that warns tourist drivers of potential accident risks. For
this goal, various tools were used: Matlab’s, Weka, ArcGIS, Google earth and Fusion.
The output of this analysis was used to develop a prototype application to warn tourist
of potential accident risks based on contextual information that could be obtained from
GPS coordinates and user’s characteristics.
Our future work aims to fully realise the mobile application and integrate its func‐
tionality with web services such as weather and temperature, to enhance the contextual
information that describe driver’s situation. This in combination with the knowledge
distilled from this study will provide the means to dynamically calculate the risk of
accident occurrence. An evaluation study will follow to assess the eﬀectiveness of the
system on tourism safety.

Abstract. The automotive industry is currently focused in the goal of developing
advanced autonomous driving systems (ADAS) and its supporting technologies.
A main condition for achieving this goal is to ensure drivers’ safety and comfort
during the ride. The driving task is often described as complex and dynamic and
can be considered as the single most risky task that the individual has to perform
on a daily basis. Since the mean age of the population in industrialized countries
is gradually increasing, one of the ADAS objective is to enhance mobility of
seniors by easing the task of driving to levels with which they are able to comply.
This paper aimed at researching present key workload indicators that can be used
by the car autonomous driving systems to establish the more eﬃcient means to
keep the senior drivers informed about the driving task and surrounding envi‐
ronment, allowing them to beneﬁt from other entertainment applications and
safely resume the driving task.

Introduction
Currently, it is easily veriﬁable that the mean age of the population in industrialized
countries is drifting, with the older population becoming more prevalent [1]. According
to the database Pordata (2016), the Portuguese aging index in 2015 was 143.9%, which
is approximately 5.2 times higher than the one measured in 1961 (27.5%). Glaser and
Schubert (2007) also refer that in 2050, and according to the German Federal Oﬃce of
Statistics, the German population with more than sixty years old will increase from the
24.1%, measured in 2001, to 36.7%. In Japan, already considered the ﬁrstsuper-aged”
country in the developed world, the elderly were responsible for more than 40% of all
traﬃc fatalities [2].
The automotive industry is focused in developing Advanced Autonomous Driving
Systems (ADAS) and its supporting technologies. A main condition for achieving this
goal is to ensure drivers’ safety and comfort during the ride. The driving task is often
described as complex and dynamic and can be considered as the single most risky task
that the individual has to perform on a daily basis [3]. Recently, the U.S.A. Department
of Transportation (DOT) issued the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy to ensure that
these technologies are safely introduced and provide present and future safety beneﬁts
[4]. In the Executive Summary of the Federal policy entitled “Accelerating the Next

Revolution in Roadway Safety”, the DOT stresses out that 35,092 people died on U.S.
roadways in 2015, and points that 94% of crashes can be tied to a human choice or error.
According to SAE’s International deﬁnitions of levels of automation, in the ﬁrst four
levels (level 0 to level 3), the human driver is responsible for taking back the control of
the car, by request of the automated system [5], and in level 4, the automated system
can only operate in certain environments and under certain conditions. Therefore, the
human driver attention to the driving task and environment must be assured and
controlled, or managed, for all these ﬁrst ﬁve levels of vehicle automation. It is generally
assumed that the deployment of automated driving will encompass six eﬀects: eliminate
or decrease congestion through management of the traﬃc ﬂow, reduce traﬃc accidents
by avoiding human errors, diminish environmental load through optimization of the
traﬃc ﬂow and reduction of the consumption of fuel, enhance the pleasure of driving
by reducing the pressure associated with driving in stressful scenarios, strengthen inter‐
national competitiveness and, adapt to demographic changes by supporting unconﬁdent
drivers and enhancing the mobility of elderly people [6, 7].
In Japan, it has been acknowledged the rise of the percentage of elderly drivers amidst
accident fatalities, as well as a pattern of errors committed by this population stratum.
Through automated driving it is expected that the workload of these drivers is signiﬁ‐
cantly lowered to levels by which they can better cope with the driving, and traﬃc
problems characteristic of elderly people will be solved [7]. As noted by [8], while the
terms stress and workload arise out of somewhat diﬀerent traditions, there is a great deal
of conceptual overlap in describing demands on the individual arising from both internal
and external factors. According to Eby, Molnar, Zhang, St Louis, Zanier and Kostyniuk
(2014), the risk of engaging in fatal crashes is higher for senior drivers, with an increased
involvement in intersection crashes.
Three functional abilities are required from the driver to perform the driving task:
cognitive, visual and psychomotor. Even though age is often associated with driving
errors, several studies point out that the declines in these functions may arise from age-
related medical conditions and medications aimed at treating these conditions [9]. Ulti‐
mately, elderly people suﬀer from speciﬁc problems in terms of divided attention
performance, which is highly required in driving [10]. Nevertheless, it is a fact that
elderly drivers with hearing loss (HL) perform worse while driving with distractors [11].
The eﬀect of HL in driving has not yet been thoroughly researched, with a strand of
researchers ﬁnding a concomitant eﬀect, while another does not ﬁnd any relation
between the two variables. The use of hearing aids, though, has been reported as being
associated with higher risk of accidents [11].
Lawton et al. (2008) refer that the task of driving, which is normally performed in a
comfortable position, can be very stressful because of the many diﬀerent solicitations
that may occur. It can be complex because of the lateral and longitudinal forces on the
driver during those solicitations, which can bring him out of balance, augmenting the
probability of wrong hand placement with the subsequent problem of activating the
wrong controls. Bellet et al. (2003) describe the driving task as both complicated and
dynamic, considering it as one with the most risks that an individual has to perform
daily. But it is interesting to verify that these conditions (daily use and associated risks)
seem to contradict each other. As driving is a complex task performed by a large part

of the population, which indicates global generalization, should, therefore, be a simple
and risk-free task. Yet this idea fades whenever the annual number of car accidents is
veriﬁed [12].
Advanced in-vehicle technologies help extend the period over which a senior driver
can drive safely, by helping older drivers avoid crashes, improve the ease and comfort
of driving, and travel to places and at times they would otherwise avoid [9]. Simulta‐
neously, more entertaining applications are being made available for the driver to use
inside the car. All things considered, one can assume that these infotainment applications
are competing with the attention and awareness of the human driver to the driving task.
Ryu et al. (2010) refer that driver information systems require drivers’ visual attention
for, for example, selecting the desired functions, which in turn can increase the periods
in which the driver eye-gaze is set oﬀ the road, consequently increasing the probability
of accident occurrence. Considering that slowness of behavior is a consequence of
ageing [13], it seems reasonable to assume that this additional workload may be
dependent of the drivers’ age. Moreover, even though one can agree that modern tech‐
nology has brought improved quality to people’s life including older ones, older people
often lack the skills to interact and beneﬁt from such technologies, which can be attrib‐
uted to the fact that the technology designers do not take into account the needs of older
people [14].
Humans are generally considered to have ﬁnite information processing resources
[15, 16], and situations that make multiple calls on these resources, particularly those
that require divided attention, may tax capacity to the point that performance and safety
margins suﬀer [17]. Under actual driving conditions, older drivers are known to self-
regulate workload, e.g., drive slower, travel during less congested periods, and avoid
distracting technologies [18, 19]. Indeed, there is still much to be learned about the
eﬃcacy of design aids and supporting tools for the older adults in particular. Knowledge
on the best way to educate and train older adults to interact with new technologies is
also lacking [14]. The “Statement of Principles, Criteria and Veriﬁcation Procedures on
Driver Interactions with Advanced In-Vehicle Information and Communication
Systems” (2006), known as “Driver Focus – Telematics Guidelines”, was developed to
provide design criteria and evaluation procedures aimed at minimizing driver distraction
potential to the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers members for creating visual-
manual interaction telematic systems, while the vehicle is in motion. Not surprisingly,
test subjects were licensed drivers between the ages of 45 years old and 65 years old.
Thus, the design of the system shall be such that the interaction shall not demand the
dedication of both hands simultaneously, allowing for one hand to be on the steering
wheel.
A study by Bekiaris, Panou and Touliou (2013) also addresses the needs of older
and other mobility-restricted divers, concluding that there are three major key points
that need to be addressed in the design of ADAS: the adequacy of ADAS warning algo‐
rithms, the restriction of accessory information services while the vehicle is in motion,
and the synchronization of the articulation of ADAS with the supply of other infotain‐
ment services.
For that reason, this paper aims to present key workload indicators that can be used
by the car autonomous driving systems to establish the more eﬃcient means to keep the

senior drivers informed about the driving task and surrounding environment, allowing
them to beneﬁt from other entertainment applications and safely resume the driving task.

State of the Art
According to Merat and Lee (2012) Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are
projected to help users during the driving task. Many diﬀerent parameters are being
constantly veriﬁed and whenever thresholds are surpassed, the system informs the
driver. ADAS systems, mainly present visual, auditory and haptic warnings [20], never‐
theless these systems, which are designed to help, if badly designed, may distract the
driver and even increase workload, enhancing the possibility of driving distraction and
for that making driving less safe [21]. SAE International (2016) suggests a broader
understanding of driving and for that purpose presents the concept of Dynamic Driving
Task (DDT) as all of the real-time operational and tactical functions required to operate
a vehicle in on-road traﬃc, excluding the strategic functions such as trip scheduling and
selection of destinations and waypoints, and including without limitation: Lateral
vehicle motion control via steering (operational); Longitudinal vehicle motion control
via acceleration and deceleration (operational); Monitoring the driving environment via
object and event detection, recognition, classiﬁcation, and response preparation (opera‐
tional and tactical); Object and event response execution (operational and tactical);
Maneuver planning (tactical); and Enhancing conspicuity via lighting, signaling and
gesturing, etc. (tactical). Taking level 3, as an example, while the ADAS is engaged, the
user must be receptive to a request to intervene and respond by performing DDT fallback
in a timely manner [5].
Studies show that an increase of the workload to the driver will cause him to focus
on the driving itself, relegating to a less demanding occasion the appreciation of his
surroundings environment, thereby decreasing the horizontal gaze movement, which
renders eye movement behavior an important indicator of the driver workload, already
referred in several literature [22–25]. Nevertheless, studies show that people suﬀering
from HL may compensate their shortcomings in detecting auditory events away from
their central ﬁeld of view by increasing their attention to their peripheral ﬁeld of view.
It is not possible to assess, yet, whether this phenomenon is also mirrored in the driving
scenario. Thorslund, Ahlström, Peters, Eriksson, Lidestam and Lyxell (2014) postulated
that, between older drivers with and without HL, more active visual scanning, with more
frequent glances of shorter duration were expected from the ﬁrst group. Their ﬁndings
indicate that visual behaviors are bound to the driving condition, wherein while driving
and performing a secondary task, both groups of drivers equally look away from the
road, with the HL group showing more frequent glances of shorter duration. When
driving and performing a secondary task, though, the HL group performed worse,
presenting fewer and more focused glances, assessing the surrounding traﬃc environ‐
ment prior to engaging on the secondary task. These results may suggest a dynamic
relationship between workload and horizontal gaze, in which HL may have a mediating
eﬀect.
Driving Workload Indicators: The Case of Senior Drivers
607

The performance indicators used to assess eye movement behavior include: number
of glances away from the road; mean duration of glances away from the road; maximum
duration of glances away from the road; and percentage of time focusing the road. [11].
According to Hart (2006) the workload experimented by an individual can be deﬁned
as the cost of accomplishment of certain mission requirements for the user, or, the portion
of human resources an operator expends when performing a speciﬁc task [26].
As posed by the authors: “Mental workload is a peculiar concept that has intuitive
appeal” remaining diﬃcult to deﬁne. Many deﬁnitions have been made but it is clear
that a consensual deﬁnition does not exist [27]. Processing human information, in
general, is considered as limited [28, 29]. Nevertheless, mental workload designates the
amount of resources committed for the processing of a certain task [30], it is connected
to the task characteristics, the situation and the person.
As it is very important to measure mental workload, in order to understand the prob‐
lematic regarding the interaction between drivers and cars, it is important that the meas‐
urement methods are valid [28]. O’Donnell and Eggemeier (1986) indicate that there
are three main approaches for the measurement of mental workload: Subjective meas‐
ures; Performance-based measures; Physiological measures.
The main advantage that is indicated for the use of physiological methods is that
these allow a direct and continuous measurement of the mental workload level [28].
According to Heine et al. (2017), Paxion et al. (2014) and Miller (2001) the most used
physiological method for estimating mental workload is the electrocardiogram (ECG).
Despite the major social and economic beneﬁts that ADAS technology enables, it is not
without risk.
First, the ADAS may encourage a driver to continue driving in situations he could
have stopped otherwise, as is the case of collision avoidance systems in fog [31]. At the
same time, ADAS can fail from either random (e.g., communications interference and
unexpected component failures) or systematic faults (for instance, software failures or
overall failures in the design of the system). Adding that to the fact that the very own
systems designed to alleviate driving strain might, themselves, increase stress by
demanding the driver to execute other tasks (aggravated by the lack of user knowledge),
the ineﬃcacy in the use of such systems can, in fact, constitute a danger itself [32].
Although intending on minimizing the eﬀects of in-vehicle systems overload on the
driver, input sensory stimuli and sources of additional mental workload inevitably
emerge during normal driving and may be compounded by the ADAS. This adding
workload brought by the ADAS should not exceed the driver’s visual, auditory, and
haptic and cognitive capacities, but often arise from complex designs with poorly
designed feedback mechanisms, which end up diminish the safety value of ADAS and
the acceptability of the system [33].
As if it were not enough, evidence shows that excessive reliance on automated can
damage the driving task performance. Claims are that autonomous performance will
only relegate abnormal tasks to manual handling, which means that manual driving will
be dealing with only sporadic situations for which the drivers will be highly estranged
with, potentially showing reactions that will fall short of optimal [32]. Furthermore, for
the majority of the time, drivers will be performing a monitoring task rather than a
driving task, which has proven to induce high levels of workload. This shift of the
608
N. Costa et al.

attention gives origin to complacency, which negatively inﬂuences alertness and reac‐
tion time [32].
According to the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traﬃc: “Every driver of a vehicle
shall in all circumstances have his vehicle under control so as to be able to exercise due
and proper care and to be at all times in a position to perform all maneuvers required of
him.”. Several industry experts have explored this topic, converging to the notion that
ADAS comply with this convention so long the responsibility is not completely shifted
to the system and the driver is able to shut down or override the driving maneuver [32].
This is very important because it imputes responsibility for the driving task, even at high
levels of autonomy, to the driver. All the components of the vehicle which provide
feedback to the driver are sources of mental and manual workload. Hence, all stimuli
(visual, auditory, haptic and cognitive) contribute to the driver’s workload [33].
The visual space capacity of the driver allows him to deviate his gaze from the road
ahead for certain periods, which may conﬁgure a visual diversion or a distraction, being
that the latter emerges when this capacity is superseded by a stimulus (prolonged ﬁxation
on an object). The auditory capacity of drivers with normal hearing exceeds their visual
capacity (even though the ﬁrst is the most diﬃcult capacity to quantify), as they can
receive more simultaneous distinct auditory inputs before achieving a level of (mental
or cognitive) workload that may already pose a risk [33]. Cognitive overload may arise
from something as simple as driving and wondering about things other than driving and
the driver experiences manual overload when he engages in secondary manipulation
tasks during driving such as adjusting vehicle controls [33]. Haptic feedbacks may allow
control of the vehicle and can either provide warnings to the driver instead of, or augment
audio/visual feedbacks when combined with the latter, not adding a cognitive workload
in many circumstances [33]. Olfactory feedbacks are not currently being used as feed‐
back mechanisms, but there are incipient studies on their triggering advantages on facil‐
itating tactile performance and maintaining alertness [33]. In short, all external and
internal stimuli that adds to the driving function aﬀects the driver mental workload. The
factors that compound for cognitive and mental workload are: traﬃc, poor visibility and
lighting, bad weather, surface poor conditions, external noise, in-vehicle noise, poorly
or partially functioning systems (e.g., windshield wiper), poorly responding vehicle
dynamics (e.g., braking response), lost directions, sources of anxiety (e.g., urgency of
trip) and the driver’s health and mood [33].
Age has proven to play a role in perception-response time and in the response reaction
of the older drivers. ADAS must ensure safe operation by older drivers.
According to the Transportation Research Circular 419, older drivers’ sequential
psychomotor response times are higher than young drivers’ and they are at higher risk
when a sequence of control movements are required (e.g., during an emergency evasive
maneuver immediately following another movement) [34].
While age diversity has previously received limited consideration, age has recently
gained considerable interest as a key characteristic that is associated with physical and
cognitive functions, experience with new technology, and ability to learn, which can
together contribute to possible age diﬀerences in how people interact with autonomous
vehicles [35].
Driving Workload Indicators: The Case of Senior Drivers
609

The concept of vigilance refers to the degree of attention the driver is allocating to
the primary task of driving. It is generally accepted that if the driver is in normal and
vigilant driving mode, he is looking towards the road ahead continuously with appro‐
priate attention, and that any deviations from this posture manifest a degree of lack of
vigilance. The driver’s degree of vigilance can be related to the state of his eyes and
mouth (whether open or closed) and to the blinking and yawning frequency. The causes
of vigilance decrement include fatigue, drowsiness, and external disturbances. Fatigue
and drowsiness are associated with a higher percentage of eye closure, measured by a
variable PERCLOS, which expresses the percentage of time in which the eyes of the
driver are between 80% and 100% closed. Fatigue may be manifested through ﬁxating
on objects, frequent blinking, head nodding and unnatural facial features. The meas‐
urement of vigilance or statement of appropriate levels of vigilance is a challenge,
because it varies among drivers. Nevertheless, many development have been achieved
through eye tracking and computer vision technology, that have enabled the measure‐
ment of some facial and eye features accurately and consequent correlation with vigi‐
lance. The Japanese National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology
developed a driver monitoring system integrated with driver assistance, the “ITS View-
Aid System,” in which driver warnings and displays are optimized according to meas‐

Methodology
Literature review followed the PRISMA Statement methodology [37], by which the
adopted inclusion criteria included only original studies written in English and published
until January 2017. The search terms used were “workload”, “driver”, “age” and after
the initial results the next step was to address only the topics related with “cars”,
“elderly” and “autonomous” for those were considered the most probable to have publi‐
cations of relevance to the present study.

Results
Workload measures can be classiﬁed as physiological, subjective or performance,
according to their nature. Physiological measures include cardiac measures (heart rate,
heart rate variability and blood pressure), respiratory measures (respiratory rate, volume
and concentration of carbon-dioxide in air ﬂow), eye activity measures (eye blink rate
and interval of closure, horizontal eye activity, pupil diameter, eye ﬁxations), speech
measures (pitch, rate, loudness) and brain activity (measured through electroencepha‐
logram and electrooculogram). The horizontal eye movement (HEM) is considered a
good indicator of visual and mental workload, as it scans the eyes’ movements used to
obtain information from the instrument panel (speedometer, side and rear-view mirrors).
It is the measure that shows more promise in assessing visual and mental workload and
research shows that an increase of HEM manifests an increase in the workload, as does
the increase of the pupil diameter [38]. Eye ﬁxations are associated with performance

measures and are just considered as diagnostic measures. Fixation Fraction (FF) relates
to eye ﬁxation time [10].
Physiological measures based on other outputs of the body may have potential for
measuring mental workload in driving situations, but because they are extremely intru‐
sive and/or require expensive machinery or tests for measurement, would be hard to use
in practical settings [38]. Other brain activity measures are the Electromyogram (EMG),
which measures ‘task irrelevant’ facial muscles that are not required in the motor
performance of a task, for diﬀerent facial muscles have been found to diﬀerentially sense
changes in mental workload (e.g., frontalis and the corrugator) and the ElectroCardio‐
Gram (ECG), which is related to cardiac measures, speciﬁcally heart rate variability
(HRV) [38]. HRV may not be a good indicator of workload in the elderly, because this
physiologic signal decreases with age [10]. Event related potentials (ERPs) are related
to ﬂuctuations in the EEG, which has an advantage of being good in the diagnostic of
mental processing [38]. Electrodermal activity (EDA) measures electrical changes in
the skin and has been shown to increase with the workload, even though it lacks specif‐
icity. Hormone levels also vary in situations of extreme stress and are usually used for
long-term studies on workload [38]. Mehler, B. Reimer, B. and F. Coughlin, J. (2012)
found heart rate and skin conductance levels (SCL) to be increased in an incremental
and statistically signiﬁcant fashion with each level of increased cognitive demand
imposed by their study design [39].
The amount of information used in working memory is assessed through subjective
measures. It is a simplistic approach, by which the statement of feeling a lot of workload
deems the task as high in workload. Even though less precise, subjective measures are
more practical. The subjective tests are ﬂexible of account for the diﬀerent capabilities
of the individuals, but considered very valuable and have proven to correlate with phys‐
iological measures of workload such as heart rate variability. These measures have also
been considered the easiest in assessing workload and proven an accurate, more direct
indicator of workload than physiological measures. Other advantages include being the
most ﬂexible and convenient, and the least intrusive, time consuming and expensive for
assessing workload. These measures are not disadvantage free, though, for instance,
problems may occur with familiarity and the chosen rating scale [38].
Subjective measures can be divided into unidimensional and multidimensional
ratings. Unidimensional rating scales are the simplest because they do not imply the use
of complicated analysis techniques. Also, the scale has (obviously) only one dimension
and is, usually, more sensitive than the multidimensional scale, which encompasses a
more complex and more time consuming form of measurement, and has between three
and six dimensions. Moreover, the multidimensional scale is generally more diagnostic
[38]. Performance, or degree of eﬀectiveness in accomplishing a given task, is resorted
to for measuring workload through primary and secondary tasks. Evidently, humans are
limited in their resources. Thus, if a task demands the same resource structure, perform‐
ance will be penalized. Hence, the workload can be estimated by measuring the decre‐
ment in performance by the primary or the secondary tasks. Even though the primary
task measure is more direct for measuring workload, both are used and leastwise moder‐
ately accepted [38].

Bruni, Chang, Carlin, Swanson and Pratt [40] classify diﬀerently the measures as
so: physiologic measures (which include pupillary response, blink rate, heart rate, or
galvanic skin response), system-based measures (e.g., number and complexity of pilot
tasks, number of tasks that compete for time or resources), and subjective measures
(such as, for each pilot task, mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand,
performance, diﬃculty, or frustration) [40].

According to Son, Lee and Kim (2011) the increase of the use of in-vehicle tech‐
nologies can increase driver distraction, and a signiﬁcant proportion of the distraction
may arise not from its manual manipulation but from cognitive consequences in their
use. Indeed, the authors state that older drivers are less capable when engaging in secon‐
dary tasks. In fact, older adults’ lower levels of energetic arousal cause them to suﬀer
vigilance loss, an aspect of monitoring found in highly reliable automated systems,
making them more vulnerable than younger adults to automation-related reductions in
monitoring eﬃciency [42]. This results in older adults taking more conservative time
612

gap decisions [43]. Even though older drivers present decremented attentional capacity,
their experience and age usually compensate, being the exception situations with high
momentary mental workload, in which they fail with severe consequences. The majority
of older drivers’ accidents are caused by inattentive driving (e.g., failing to look forward,
judgmental error and delayed discovery) [41]. Thus, compensatory behaviors like speed
adjustment for coping with increasing workload may be feasible indicators of workload
in seniors. Risky decisions arise for older drivers when time pressure is added, because
compensatory strategies become ineﬀective [43]. De Waard (1996) states that speed
measures are the most reliable, sensitive indicators of increased mental load in both
laboratory and simulator experiments.
The ﬁndings of this research are that the ability of maintaining longitudinal control
can deteriorate with increased cognitive workload, and therefore, this may constitute
another important indicator of workload in seniors [41]. Even with compensatory driving
strategies, like lower speed, driving is an activity that leads to a considerable higher
mental workload for the older drivers than for the younger. This aftermath was aggra‐
vated in more complex driving situations, e.g., overtaking [44].

Conclusion
Driving is an activity that leads to a considerable higher mental workload for the older
drivers when comparing to the younger drivers. Compensatory driving strategies, like
speed adjusting are mechanisms that older people adopt to cope with this high-
demanding task, and even more so in more complex driving situations, such as round‐
abouts, intersections and overtaking. The main indicators of the seniors´ workload while
driving are the adjustment of speed, lateral and longitudinal maintenance control. The
measurement of workload through signals which suﬀer decay with aging, like HRV,
should take into account that these are can be poor indicators of workload in older
drivers. Literature review enhances the inﬂuence of compensatory behaviors like adjust‐
ment of speed and grants them the most feasible factors for determining elderly workload
during the task of driving.

Abstract. Travelling to any educational institutions in the Republic of Mauritius
is a free service provided by the government, but because of hectic lifestyles of
parents and heavy traﬃc congestions, many parents avail of the services of school
vans. However, the image of such vans has been tarnished due to some serious
incidents while commuting the children to and from school. This study uses the
KABP constructs to assess school van driver’s perceptions in ensuring children
health and safety when commuting to and from school. Questionnaires were
distributed to sixty-eight school van drivers. Findings indicated that drivers have
sound Knowledge, positive Attitude, good Practices and proper intentional
Behaviours in order to ensure the health and safety of the children commuting in
their school vans. The study has helped in identifying the relevant relationships
between Knowledge, Attitude, Behaviour and Practices of school van drivers in
Mauritius.

Introduction
The World Health Organisation made Road Safety the theme of World Health Day in
April 2004. Road accidents are the principle cause of death of young man under 25 [1,
17]. According to Peden et al. [13], accidents are also among one of the leading causes
of death and injury for children worldwide. Although the way children travel and their
travel experiences have been researched from diﬀerent perspectives [9, 12], the safety
perspective as far as transportation of children is concerned has been very modest till
now.
However, engagement in these behavioural processes is not a ‘quick ﬁx’, and there
is a need to investigate beforehand its fundamental constituting elements [7]. The health
and safety ﬁeld investigates children’s harm prevention and health promotion [3] and
among the various areas of interest is the prevention of injuries, the embracing of healthy
habits, proper practice development, as well as policy making [3]. These areas of interest
are mainly present when considering major health and safety risks in child travel, and
more speciﬁcally in school bus/vans [14].

This study takes place in the Republic of Mauritius where, since September 2005,
travelling to school as well as to any tertiary institutions by public transport is a free
service provided to all students by the Government. Approximately 50,000 children are
using school vans to commute to and from school (Le DeﬁQuotidien, 28th May 2012).
However, over the past few years, because of some recurring events, the reputation of
these private contract buses has been tarnished. They are seen as a lucrative business,
having low concern about the responsibilities regarding the safety and health of children
commuting with them. There are evidences of not only many school buses operating
illegally (Le DeﬁQuotidien, 28th June 2012 and 01st June 2012), but also school van
operators have been blamed to be the cause of few fatal accidents involving children
(Le DeﬁQuotidien, 21st March 2012 and 25th April 2012). Even after more than 10 years
that laws and regulations have been introduced to ensure the safety of child passengers
travelling by the private school buses, the situation has not really changed in Mauritius.
The researchers therefore try to elucidate key aspects pertaining to the safety of
children while commuting to and from school, using the Knowledge, Attitude, Behav‐
iour and Practices (KABP) Approach among school van drivers and they attempt to:
(i) explore the understanding of school van drivers’ knowledge, attitude and behaviour
in the course of their duties
(ii) examine the health and safety KABP of school van drivers when commuting young
children to and from school
2
Literature Review
2.1
Health and Safety Among Commuting Children
There has been an increasing link between transport and health of individuals over the
few recent years [16]. Closely linked to road transport and safety, but yet not adequately
researched is the reality which school children face as far as their transportation and
road accidents are concerned. Health and Safety is inﬂuenced by various factors;
including the authorities’ attitudes to promote it and act upon it, to the diﬀerent stake‐
holders’ attitude and commitment towards a healthy and safe environment [7]. Improve‐
ment in health and safety performances is done through the introduction of behavioural
health and safety processes, which identiﬁes and reduces unsafe and unhealthy practices
[7]. However, these processes are not a ‘quick ﬁx’ and there is a need not to overlook
its fundamental constituting elements [7]. Therefore, in order for these processes to be
eﬃcient, one should start by concentrating on the underlying laws and regulations
present, the nature and characteristics of the area or setting in which they would be
applied (e.g. industries, transportation, hospitals, etc.), as well as the roles played in by
the diﬀerent stakeholders [7].
Behaviour is deﬁned as any observable action by an individual [7]. It has been esti‐
mated by the Health and Safety Executive in UK [6] that up to 80% of accidents was
due to people’s behaviour, both in the form of acts and omissions. These thus add up to
pre-existing threatening factors, to end up as a negative event [6]. Various reasons have
been identiﬁed as leading to ‘at risk’ behaviours (see for example [7]). Adopting
KABP School Van Drivers
617

therefore a behaviour-based perspective enables to focus on these observable and meas‐
urable unsafe and unhealthy behaviours in a particular setting [7]. It also allows treating
safe and healthy behaviours as critical skills that need to be adopted through a change
in the setting’s culture [7]. Moreover, from this behaviour-based perspective, adult indi‐
viduals are recognised and considered “as a mature human being with a genuine interest
in their own wellbeing, who contribute best when they can see that they themselves can
inﬂuence their own safety” ([7], p. 3).
Operating a school bus/van has now become very challenging, due to the new safety
measures and the governing legislations being continually developed, assessed and modi‐
fied [5]. Furthermore, with the several accidents involving school vans, the safety issue has
been questioned and promoted to a higher level [11]. The Health and Safety field care for
children in preventing harm and promoting health [3]. As opposed to adults, school chil‐
dren have specific safety travel requirements, which are in relation to the major health risk
to child travel in vehicles. These include trauma and accidental injury [14]. Much can be
done by the concerned stakeholders to prevent these school bus related trauma and inju‐
ries from happening [10]. School bus operators, parents, policy makers as well as the
school administration have roles and responsibilities in this public health and safety issue
[10]. Moreover different child’s (i.e. age, sex and anthropometry), vehicle’s (i.e. seating

capacity, recognition marks, features like seat belts, space of movement and mobility, and
seating ergonomics) and service’s (i.e. hours- morning and evening, journey time, and days
of the week) characteristics need also to be considered [2]. This issue therefore is
approached on multiple levels, as shown in Fig. 1, as they all have a role and shared
responsibilities in the provision health and safety to children [2, 10].
However, since deﬁned roles and responsibilities are still unstructured in the Mauri‐
tian context, their investigation needs to be supported by a strong scientiﬁc approach
and underlying relevant theory assessing the behaviours. Thus, the KAPB and the TPB
have shown to be relevant approaches to investigate road safety and health behaviours.
2.2
Knowledge, Attitude, Behaviour and Practices (KABP) Approach
The KABP approach, which has as main purpose the study of Knowledge, Attitude,
Behaviour and Practices, is considered as an educational investigation of the community.
It has been used to analyse the response of patients towards treatment [8], the knowledge
of breastfeeding among mothers (UNFAO & FSAU Report [18], the behaviour of nurses
with respect to care giving [19], and among practicing dentists [4]. Using this approach
in the school van context will help in elucidating what stakeholders know about child
health and safety in commuting to and from school, how they feel about it, how they
behave and, eventually which coping practices have been adopted. The ‘Knowledge’
would more speciﬁcally gauge what the stakeholders know about their role and respon‐
sibilities in ensuring safety when commuting children as well as general road safety.
‘Attitude’ would reﬂect the stakeholders’ feelings about health and safety of school
children while commuting them. ‘Behaviour’ and ‘Practices’ would involve how they
would translate their knowledge and attitude through actions while at work.

Method
The survey method was adopted for the purpose of this study. The target group were
drivers of school vans. Convenient sampling was used to select the van drivers from the
ﬁve towns of the Island. The participants were recruited through the local private school
bus association “Association of School Bus Owners”, the National Transport Authority
(NTA) and by peer reference. In all, 68 drivers agreed to take part in the study.
The questionnaire for each group was based on the literature pertaining to KABP
constructs, and the salient themes in the ﬁeld of health and safety (i.e. Health, Ergo‐
nomics, Physical Hazards, Hygiene, Safety, and Prevention). It contained ﬁve sections
as follows: Section A consisted of demographic information about participants’ gender,
age, professional driving experience, work experience, education level, no. of road
accidents, no. of trips per day, no. of children carried, registration with authorities,
helper’s presence and working area. Section B consisted of an adapted version of the
Driver Attitude Questionnaire (DAQ)-SF assessing the drivers’ attitude towards safe
driving, based on three sub-sections: the Law, the other drivers and me-the driver
respectively [15]. The 12 items were measured using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly
Disagree – 5 = Strongly Agree). Section C consisted of 9 questions assessing
KABP School Van Drivers
619

Knowledge. This factor measured driver’s knowledge about child safety (e.g. as a driver,
I think I should get registered with the NTA as School Bus). Section D consisted of the
Drivers’ practices and had 24 items. The drivers’ practices consisted of 5 sub-sections,
namely Health, Ergonomics, Physical Hazards, Hygiene and Others.
Finally, Section E consisted of 18 questions assessing the drivers’ intention in
ensuring child safety (e.g. as a driver, I intend to ensure that there is a helper in the van).
The scale uses a 5-point scale from 5 (deﬁnitely do) to 1 (deﬁnitely do not). The drivers’
intentions were grouped into 3 sub-sections, which are namely Hazards, Safety and
Prevention. A pilot test was carried out with 4 drivers involved in the provision of the
service in doing so, any ambiguities were addressed. Since most of the participants were
not conversant with the English language, they were assisted by the researchers in ﬁlling-
up their surveys.
Ethical research practice was also ensured in asking for informed consent before
ﬁlling in the survey, although the questionnaire was an anonymous one. Despite all these
steps taken, resistance among the drivers were noted, mainly because they thought that
the survey was a means to get inside information regarding their business. Another major
problem encountered was the restrained time schedule of the drivers.

Findings
4.1
Knowledge
The least important item in the knowledge variable was found to be the presence of a
helper to attend the children during the journey, at pick up and at drop oﬀ (Mean 4.65),
as compared to the most important one as being the respect of road signs (Mean 4.85).
Ensuring the safe drop oﬀ and pick up of the young travellers also yield a considerable
high score (Mean 4.84).
4.2
Attitude
The Attitude variable was broken into three themes, Law, Other School Van drivers and
self. Figures show that in general, attitude towards overtaking is of least importance in
ensuring the safety of children in the school van (Mean 2.22). Attitude towards close
following was of most importance when considering the law, as opposed to the two other
themes (i.e. others and Self), in which drink driving is of utmost importance (Mean 1.21).
4.3
Practices
The Practices variable was broken into ﬁve themes – Health, Ergonomics, Physical
Hazards, Hygiene and Others. Figures obtained show that the most salient theme is
driver’s concern more about Hygiene practices (Mean 4.68). When considering the
Health theme, the most salient item emerged as catering for those who are travel sick
(Mean 4.41), and the least salient one, the separation of those having ﬂu/cold to avoid
contamination (Mean 3.30). For the Ergonomics theme, much importance was given to
620
S.D. Lukea-Bhiwajee and P. Ramseook-Munurrun

the provision of good aeration in the van (Mean 4.66), than for the proper disposition
of the children luggage (Mean 4.66). Ensuring the van’s ﬁtness (Mean 4.74) was the
most salient item when considering Physical Hazards, than ensuring that all the children
are sitting at the back with the helper (Mean 4.32). When considering the Hygiene theme,
the most important theme emerged as the helper’s and driver’s grooming (Mean 4.86),
and the least one, the maintenance of the air conditioner for an allergy free environment
(Mean 4.38). When considering the “Other Stakeholders” theme, ﬁgures indicate that
the drivers’ acknowledge that the parents totally rely on their service as least important
item (Mean 4.51), and the most important one was the communication with those same
parents (Mean 5.22).
4.4
Practices
The Intention variable is broken into three themes – Hazardous Behaviour, Safety and
Prevention. There is a significant difference among the mean scores of these three themes,
with the most salient ones being the Drivers’ intention to further adopt Hazardous and
Safety behaviours (Mean 4.71). When considering the Hazardous theme, the most salient
items happened to be permanent fitness of the van (Mean 4.88) and the maintenance of the
van (Mean 4.88), and the least salient one, having a seat belt for each passenger (Mean
4.35). It has been found that for the Safety theme, much importance is given to the real job
commitment as children lives are involved (Mean 4.82), than for the avoidance of phone
while driving (Mean 4.54). Providing one’s views to authorities to ameliorate comfort and
safety (Mean 4.69) is the most salient item when considering Prevention, than getting over‐
loaded with work, which is seen as least important (Mean 4.59).
In line with the objectives of the study, the overall means for all the variables
under the KABP construct were identified. The overall mean for Attitude was 4.30
(SD = .772), while that for Knowledge was 4.76 (SD = .471). The overall mean
Practices was 4.51 (SD = .654), and that for Intention was 4.69 (SD = .533) (see
Table 1). A significant difference among the mean scores of the different construct
of the KABP is noted, with the most salient one being the drivers’ Knowledge in
ensuring the health and safety of the children (p < .001).

Discussion
5.1
Drivers’ Knowledge
The ﬁndings as above indicate that drivers have good and sound knowledge of what they
should be doing to ensure the health and safety of the children commuting with them.
However a lack in recognising the importance of some salient components in their
operation has also been noted. It has been identiﬁed that the majority of the drivers gave
very much importance to ‘respecting the road signs’ in commuting school children to
ensure their health and safety, while neglecting the importance of the helper’s role in
ensuring the health and safety of the children on the journey. This discrepancy can be
explained by the fact that ‘respecting road signs’, being a fundamental traﬃc law, has
become part of the routine of these drivers. On the other hand, the new law regarding
the compulsory presence of a helper is not taken seriously by some drivers who do not
understand the need for it as they believe that “they themselves, can do the work”.
Therefore, there is a need to reinforce and consolidate the knowledge of the drivers,
through proper training, as it is the case in the foreign countries (See for example Florida
Transit Handbook, 2012; Pennsylvania School Bus Driver’s Manual, n.d.; School Bus
Drivers Handbook, n.d.).
5.2
Drivers’ Attitude
A discrepancy has been noted among the drivers’ attitude towards the law, the other
drivers and themselves, in ensuring the health and safety of the children commuting with
them. It has been noted that drivers have a strong positive attitude towards abiding to
the country’s law to ensure the health and safety of the children as, if being sanctioned
by the concerned authorities they will automatically be sent to court which might impact
on their driving permit. The drivers are more concerned about “close following” being
dangerous for the health and safety of the children than overtaking, as according to them
when following close, one does not have much control due to the vehicle in front, while
overtaking is in the drivers’ full control. The drivers perceive drinking & driving as
dangerous for the health and safety of the children. However, as for the law, they give
low importance to the danger that overtaking might bring for the above mentioned
reason. Also the other drivers are perceived as having good health and safety behaviours,
even if the drivers are having a weak positive attitude towards them. It has been noted
that, as for them drink and driving from other drivers are also perceived as dangerous
for the health and safety of the children, while for other drivers also, overtaking is not
an issue.
5.3
Drivers’ Practices
It has been noted that the drivers are very concerned with hygiene practices. The most
important for them is being well groomed and clean when working with the children,
and least concerned with the air conditioner ﬁlter being well maintained and allergy free,
as these are usually not in use. The second most important issue identiﬁed, is the “Other
622
S.D. Lukea-Bhiwajee and P. Ramseook-Munurrun

Stakeholders”, which would include the help received from parents and school, as well
as preventive measures in ensuring the health and safety of the children commuting with
them. The drivers identiﬁed that for their practice to be in favour of the children’s health
and safety, communication with parents is the key, while appraising that they are the
sole reliance of parents in taking their children to and from school is of low importance.
The third important practice is catering for physical hazards. The drivers are concerned
about ensuring their van’s ﬁtness as an important practice of the health and safety of the
children, as if the van is not ﬁt for road, they will not have the right to run it. However,
ensuring that all the children are sitting back with the helper is of least importance, as
in some vans, small children are sitting in front or there might be no helper at all in the
van. Moreover, it has also been noted that practices concerning ergonomics and health,
are of lower importance respectively, as most of the concerned practices are more,
according to the drivers, the helpers’ roles and duties, and this is a recurrent ﬁnding
through the research. This can, as mentioned before be supported by drivers and helpers,
having established their roles and duties, work in a team to ensure the health and safety
of the children.
5.4
Drivers’ Intention
It has been noted that drivers were more concerned in changing and improving the risks
and hazards than improving behaviours, to ensure the health and safety of the children
commuting with them. It has also been found that they intend to be more committed to
their job, as life of children is involved. However, not using the phone while driving has
been given low importance, as according to them, parents can be calling them anytime.
Moreover, when considering hazards eliminating behaviours, it has been found that the
drivers intend to always keep their vehicle ﬁt for the transportation of children and thus
the school van is well maintained.
Furthermore, issues like children school bags being stored in a dedicated place, is
considered of least importance in ensuring the health and safety of the children. This
can be explained by the fact the school van is either overcrowded or the drivers have a
hectic schedule and thus might not have enough time to wait for the child to search for
his bag at the time of drop out. These ﬁndings therefore show that while the drivers have
good intentions tend to ensure best transport, comfort and safety to the children, they
do not intend to overload themselves with work. They might be more concerned about
a good yield in the end, i.e. getting the van overloaded with children or maximising the
number of trips.
6
Recommendations
6.1
Focused, Specialised Training and Examinations to Reinforcing
the Operators’ “Knowledge” and Eventually “Practice”
The ﬁndings clearly revealed a strong positive relationship between Knowledge and
Practices among operators surveyed. Thus, the more and/or better Knowledge will the
drivers have, the safer will be their Practices adopted. Having said so, better and more
KABP School Van Drivers
623

appropriate training could be provided to drivers which would result in the adoption of
safer practices on their part. Concerned authorities should thus provide for more focused
and school van operator oriented training. For example, drivers could be provided speci‐
alised training pertaining to safe driving, road safety and health and safety of commuting
children.
This study has proved that formalised and specialised training is of utmost important
to drivers. Parallel with the above, authorities concerned might even also go further and
provide for adequate testing of Knowledge through specialised examinations for school
van operators (i.e. practical and oral) before issuing of licences and/or registrations.
Currently, in Mauritius, this is the case only for taxi drivers, but, this study has provided
enough evidence for such a practice to be extended to school van operators as well.
6.2
Reinforcement of Laws for Improved “Attitude”
This study revealed the positive “Attitude” that school van drivers have towards the job
they are doing. They acknowledge that considerable number of parents rely on them for
the services they oﬀer, but most importantly for ensuring that their children have a safe
and healthy journey to and from school.
The ﬁndings show that the drivers paid much importance to their road safety behav‐
iours (close following, drinking, and overtaking) and van maintenance more precisely
because of exigencies of the law. In this respect, concerned authorities should tighten
supervision and strengthen, if required, existing laws governing the operation of school
vans (e.g. registrations and abiding to road traﬃc laws). Such practices will further
consolidate the good “Attitude” of drivers towards their jobs.
6.3
Provision of Improved Infrastructure to Encourage Good “Intention”
As indicated in the study, although the intention to provide for appropriate infrastructure
is here, there are, for example no rules regarding the wearing of safety belts among
commuting children. More so, many schools still do not possess a dedicated lay by for
the pickup and drop oﬀ of school children. The traﬃc authorities could thus, in a ﬁrst
instance, ensure that in front of each school there is a safe drop oﬀ and pick up area, in
addition to the pedestrian and traﬃc oﬃcer already present. In doing so, school van
drivers can safely drop oﬀ and pick up the children.
7
Conclusion and Scope for Further Research
This study has provided some rich insight about the perception of health and safety of
commuting children among Mauritian school van drivers through KABP constructs. The
study does have some limitations, in the sense that it mainly described the drivers’
perception (i.e. through the descriptive analyses made) and only investigated the rela‐
tionship between the KABP constructs. Therefore, no causality can be inferred through
these ﬁndings. This therefore paves the way for further research. More so, literature
being scarce in using KABP constructs on the health and safety of children commuting
624
S.D. Lukea-Bhiwajee and P. Ramseook-Munurrun

to and from school, this study sets the way for future research in this direction. Further
research could investigate into the causality of these constructs on health and safety,
while others could investigate into the other stakeholders’ perception (i.e. the parents,
the school, traﬃc police oﬃcers). This would enable triangulation of the ﬁndings and
therefore portray a fairer picture of the issue under study.
Nevertheless, this piece of work provides insightful recommendations for not only
researchers in the ﬁeld, but has also provided adequate scientiﬁc data for policy makers
The need of having more studies in this ﬁeld is undeniable and thus encouraged, because
of the importance it holds in the everyday life of parents and children attending school.

Abstract. It has been suggested that we have moved into an adaptive age of
safety and that one of the key accident prevention strategies in this age is that of
‘organisational learning’. Effective safety management in this age requires
organisations to investigate and learn from (major/serious) incidents. This paper
aims to outline some of the most signiﬁcant barriers to organisational learning
following major events, through an integrative review, by reviewing the current
literature around incident reporting. This review identiﬁed ﬁve key themes in the
published literature, and a gap between knowledge and actual practice in
industry. As a community of safety professionals there is much we can do to
close this gap, through empirical studies aimed to further understanding and
break down some of these learning barriers.

Introduction
It has been suggested that we have moved into an adaptive age of safety [2] where the
focus is on building resilience [12]. This ﬁfth age of safety follows technological,
human error, socio-technical and cultural ages [2, 13] and builds on our understanding
of how accidents are caused and how they can be prevented. The adaptive age rec-
ognizes that human adaptability plays an important role in the function of modern
systems, and ‘organisational learning’ is one of main approaches for developing resi-
lience [13]. These ﬁve ages of safety have been further condensed into three eras of
safety, with the ﬁrst era being contemporary approaches to safety, the second era being
advanced approaches and the third and current era being sophisticated approaches [12].
In this era an organisation’s ability to learn from the lessons of the past is crucial for
improving and managing safety [12].
This paper looks at one aspect of organisational learning, namely investigation and
reporting of events, and considers how organisations learn through this process. It
includes a review of the published literature on the investigation and reporting of
accidents and incidents in order to understand known or potential barriers to successful

organisational learning following serious events, with the aim of determining best
practice in this area of practice.

Methods for Search, Selection and Review
Although a number of methods are available for conducting reviews of published
literature, including systematic and narrative reviews [3], an integrative review was
chosen as the approach for this study. This method was selected in order to provide a
deep understanding of key themes summarised from both theoretical and empirical
data. This approach has been used in a number of safety related topics such as safety
culture [18] and more recently in construction health and safety [14].
The ScienceDirect academic journal database was searched using keywords
(Table 1) to identify related literature and the search results were screened for relevance
to the research topic. The ﬁrst screening was by journal title, the second through a
review of the abstract and conclusions, and the third by review of the entire article. In
addition, several articles identiﬁed from reference lists were also screened for inclusion
(Fig. 1).

Findings and Discussion
Five key themes emerged as barriers to effective organisational learning from incidents.
3.1
Theme 1: Incident Reporting
Under-reporting of near misses [10], abnormal conditions or weak signals [7] can hide
conditions that lead to major events. In industries where reporting levels are high this
can cause important reports to be missed in the masses and go unnoticed [10]. Lack of
trust or openness [10, 16], blame cultures [10, 11, 15] or lack of feedback [1, 5, 11] are
all causes of non- reporting or underplaying events and can result in important infor-
mation being withheld meaning opportunities to prevent incident occurrence or
reoccurrence.
3.2
Theme 2: Incident Investigation
Time constraints [15], production pressures and the need to move on to other problems
can hamper effective investigations [6] and a tendency to focus on technical symptoms
and quick ﬁxes [10, 17] often leaves structural or system issues unaddressed [6]. The
possibility of disciplinary action can limit openness and transparency in investigations
[11] and political pressures may result in incidents being normalised [5, 16] particularly
in high risk industries.
3.3
Theme 3: Investigation Models and Methods
Many accident investigation methods require a high level of expertise [8, 17] and can
lead to reliance on model-based software packages rather than the investigative pro-
cesses behind them [17]. Some techniques can only ﬁnd causes based on what the
investigator currently knows and consider only events underlying an accident rather
than the entire accident process [9]. Lindberg et al. [10] observed that there is little in
the way of guidance material around the selection or practical use of methods.
3.4
Theme 4: Recommendations and Preventative Action Planning
Drupsteen and Hasle [6] found that planning actions formed the greatest bottleneck to
learning from incidents. Actions may instead be skewed towards “what we can do
something about” [17] rather than the deeper systemic issues. Some of the barriers to
effective action planning include limited time to design and complete actions, budget
[17], limited involvement of frontline staff and production focus [6, 9]. Actions are
often determined by a small group [15, 17] yet to be successful event analysis must
empower all stakeholders to question organisational and system issues without negative
pressure [11].
An Integrative Literature Review
631

3.5
Theme 5: Learning Opportunities
Review of action effectiveness or even action completion is often not done [5, 17] and
it can be hard to reﬂect backwards with new events happening that require attention.
Without senior leader support [6] it may be very difﬁcult to achieve any lasting change
that can prevent future events. Double-loop learning can address all contributing causes
and conditions [1, 5, 6, 11] but normalization can prevent incidents becoming ‘focusing
events’ where no double-loop learning occurs [5, 16].
Learning from events involves far more than simply disseminating information [10,
11]. Effective learning requires knowing how to learn [11, 15] and individual and
active participation [5, 10] throughout all stages of the investigation process and
requires attention and emphasis from leaders [17].
3.6
Gaps in the Literature
A number of gaps in the literature have been identiﬁed for future research opportu-
nities. It is clear that while theory abounds on investigation models and methods and
organisational learning, many more practical evidential studies are required in order to
answer some of the questions raised by the authors cited in this review. There have
been very few studies undertaken to test the theory and there is little currently to guide
practitioners in closing the gap between organisational learning theory and practice
following incident events.
3.7
Recommendations for Best Practice
Recommendations for best practice include further empirical studies on: how different
groups within organisations learn most effectively; observation of learning in action
following events to deﬁne opportunities missed; the direct causes and latent conditions
for failure to effectively learn from incidents; deﬁning a set of indicators for propensity
to learn; how to establish an effective and rigorous process developing remedial
actions; study of investigation methods in practice across an industry to gauge effec-
tiveness in reality; development of selection criteria for investigation events; what
effective dissemination of information looks like; and environmental conditions and
delivery modes for successful knowledge sharing following events.
Also, as noted by Sanne [16] major event investigations would beneﬁt from sup-
porting Social Scientist participation so that the global community can reap the beneﬁt
of these windows of opportunity for understanding human factors and the social
environments surrounding events.

Conclusion
If organisational learning is one of the key accident prevention strategies of the current
‘adaptive’ age of safety then the safety profession has much work ahead of it to ﬁnd
how to do this effectively. Currently opportunities for this learning are often missed, or
632

not realised fully, so priceless lessons that could save lives go unlearned. The ability to
develop true resilience lies in part with being able to understand future risks fully by
learning from past events including those that did not result in catastrophic conse-
quences. With a focus on signiﬁcant loss incidents, industry remains blindsided by
these events even though too often there were precursors including near misses, weak
signals or abnormal conditions that were either not recognised or given the attention
they deserved.
Time and budget constraints, lack of skill or competency to report, select, analyse
and investigate events coupled with our increasingly complex socio-technical systems
means these preventable accidents will continue unless we adapt our learning models
and methods effectively to accommodate all levels of workers within organisations with
all their respective attitudes, capabilities, mind sets and degrees of inﬂuence.
Further empirical studies around the suggested barriers to effective organisational
learning throughout the full lifecycle of incident investigation are urged.

Abstract. With the rapid development of society around the world, the population
of cities such as Beijing and Shanghai has increased dramatically, and large social
activities have been increasing. Safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of
citizens and strengthening public safety is one of the most important problems. There‐
fore, it is a very important research topic to study the aggregation phenomenon and the
evacuation characteristics of the public places, to explore the reasonable group organ‐
ization and evacuation mode, and to find ways and means to reduce the risk of acci‐
dents. When a sudden event occurs in a public place, the crowd is evacuated using the
particle swarm algorithm. In addition, the shortcomings of the traditional particle
swarm optimization are improved, and the influence of obstacle on individual evac‐
uation path selection is fully considered. Finally, the thermodynamic diagram is used
to simulate the model, and the feasibility of the model is verified.

Introduction
With the rapid development of urbanization and the rapid development of economic society,
recreational activities, exhibition activities, sports events, celebrations and other large-scale
crowd gathering activities frequently, civil airports, sports venues, squares and other places
of public places in the sharp increase The There is no obvious precursor to the occurrence
of sudden public events, and there is a sudden and complex. Under normal circumstances,
the occurrence of public emergencies can cause significant casualties, social harm and prop‐
erty damage. Over the years, sudden public events have occurred frequently, especially
groups of stampede events, in which the case of a major crowded stampede event is shocking:
• November 29, 2010, in Aksu City, Xinjiang Hangzhou Avenue Aksu ﬁfth primary
school serious stampede accident, nearly 100 students were injured [1];
• January 14, 2011, India, Kerala, a more serious stampede incident, the accident at
least 100 people were killed and dozens of injuries [1];
• February 21, 2011, Mali capital Bamako stadium took place stampede event.
According to the data released by the Government, the incident has caused 36 people
were killed and 64 injured [1];

• September 26, 2014 at 2 pm, Kunming Mingtong primary school stampede accident,
resulting in 6 people were killed and 26 injured [1];
• December 31, 2014, Shanghai Bund occurred crowded stampede accident. Killing
36 people and injuring 47 others [1];
• On September 24, 2015, 717 people were killed and more than 800 others were
wounded by the pilgrims in the Mina area, 5 km east of Saudi Arabia [1].
In order to solve the problem of evacuation, the relevant departments should take safe
and feasible emergency measures, not only to evacuate the evacuation of individuals in the
environment, but also to make the evacuation process as a whole the overall safety and
efficiency. In order to accomplish this goal, it is necessary for the research workers of
various disciplines to analyze and solve the problems. These disciplines mainly include
geography, artificial intelligence, public safety, computer science, geological exploration and
other disciplines [2–4]. The most important thing about evacuation is how to ensure that
people evacuate quickly and safely in an emergency and complex environment. Therefore,
the problem of group evacuation is more and more concerned by scholars, and has gradu‐
ally become a hot topic. The research direction mainly includes the movement law and
characteristics of the group, how to effectively and safely supervise the group, so as to
develop the efficient and scientific and reasonable evacuation method for the evacuation
work of the group, and effectively direct and guide the crowd. At present, the research on
emergency evacuation at home and abroad mainly includes the establishment of evacuation
model and two aspects of simulation experiment. On the one hand, the establishment of
evacuation model mainly uses game theory, social dynamics [5], cellular automata [6], fluid
dynamics and other methods. The evacuation model was established, and the performance
analysis of the model was carried out to study the aggregation, friction and crowding of the
crowd in different environments, so as to guide the effective evacuation of the crowd. On the
other hand, the study of the evacuation process in the shortest evacuation path, the fastest
evacuation flow and other issues. However, this research needs to be based on the nature of
the different road network analysis, such as the static characteristics of the road network, the
dynamic characteristics of the crowd and the vehicle and so on. Therefore, most of the
current evacuation measures are to ease the crowd in emergency situations, and the hidden
crisis for the characteristics of the crowd is lack of relevant research. Urgent evacuation of
the crowd is important, but effective prevention and reduction of the occurrence of an emer‐
gency is particularly important. How to effectively manage the complex, large crowd in
large public facilities, to prevent the occurrence of an emergency is of great significance.
In this paper, the particle swarm optimization [7, 8] is used to abstract and model the
evacuation of people in the evacuation scene in emergencies. Each individual is abstracted
into particles, and the selection of the optimal value of the particle through the particle
Explore the optimal information to change the velocity vector of the particle and keep it near
the safe location and evacuate.

Particle Swarm Optimization
Particle swarm optimization is a stochastic optimization algorithm for population, proposed
by Kennedy and Eberhart. The algorithm has been widely concerned. Rada et al. have
636
D. Li et al.

studied the algorithm’s synchronization and neighborhood size problem. Particle swarm
optimization produces a new evolutionary algorithm for the study of foraging behavior of
birds. The researchers found that in the process of predation of birds or fish, the group in
accordance with a cooperative way, through their own continuous access to information, to
adapt, and then obtain information, and then adapt, and constantly adjust their own speed and
direction, the whole process is Its optimized process. Use the vector group (xm
i , vm
i , pbesti)
to represent the particle, use xm
i  to represent the position of the particle itself, use vm
i  to repre‐
sent the current direction, use pbesti to represent the best position of the search itself, all the
particles by evaluating a function f(x) to determine the fitness value Change the value. Each
particle has a memory function that can remember its own optimal position and follow the
surrounding optimal particles. In the standard of Particle swarm optimization, the particle’s
position and velocity are updated as follows:
Xm
id = Xm−1
id
+ Vm−1
id
.
(1)
Vm
id = WVm−1
id
+ c1r1
(pbestid −Xm
id
) + c2r2
(gbestid −Xm−1
id
).
(2)
In the formula: Xm
id represents the position of the population; Vm
id indicates the speed at
which the person moves; pbesti is the best position for the i particle: gbesti is the best bit
value for the population; c1 and c2 are the acceleration factors, respectively, indicating the
particle arrives at the best position Good position of the acceleration weight; r1 and r2 are the
random numbers between 0 to 1; W is expressed as an inertia factor. The formula (2) shows
that the particle velocity update can be divided into three parts: the first part shows the
velocity inertia of the particle i, which can form a better balance between the global search
and the local search. The second part shows the optimal position of the individual The effect
of velocity, which determines the ability of the particle to be locally searched; the third part
reflects the effect of the optimal position of the population on the speed, which reflects the
communication within the group.

Avoidance Mechanism
3.1
Evaluation Function
In the classic Particle Swarm Optimization, the particle only focuses on the final target
position and finds that the individual moves directly to the point after the target position and
does not take into account the limitations of the obstacle, which is negligible in the evacua‐
tion process. In reality, pedestrians should consider each step of the escape route choice, in
which static obstacles and other pedestrians will have an impact on the choice of the path,
the introduction of the evaluation function to simulate obstacles and other pedestrians on the
impact of pedestrians:
cos t(p, q) = exp
(
−
(
(p−q)2
(𝜎p+𝜎q)
2
))
.
(3)
The Study of Population Evacuation Problems
637

In the formula (3), p represents a particle, q represents an obstacle, including other parti‐
cles and static buildings, σp is expressed as a particle radius, σq is expressed as an obstacle
coverage. The evaluation function here refers to the impact of obstacles (including other
pedestrians and buildings) in the process of pedestrian movement. Considering the evalua‐
tion function [9], the objective function can be set to:
Fobj(p) = cobs × max(cos t(p, o)) +
1
cos t(p, g).
(4)
In the formula (4), o refers to a collection of all obstacles, g is expressed as a particle-
oriented and standard position, cobs is expressed as a weight parameter that adjusts the rela‐
tionship between the obstacle and the target. The setting of the objective function adds the
cost function mechanism, which can more effectively and effectively simulate the path
selection in the process of pedestrian orientation.
3.2
Judgment Mechanism
The introduction of the value factor in the evaluation function makes the particles can realize
the avoidance of obstacles and other pedestrians to a certain extent. For the more realistic
simulation of the actual situation, we introduce the following judgment mechanism [10] on
the basis of the above evaluation function, Whether the new position of the trend conforms
to the common sense rule and determines whether the new position is accepted as follows:
prob(f) = 1 −f
e−k .
(5)
In the formula (5), it is the value of the new position, it is constant, used to control the
particles near the obstacles and other pedestrian behavior, the function can better prevent the
collision between particles. In order to simulate pedestrian obstruction and other pedestrian
route selection, if the new location is not accepted, in the original position on the basis
of ±15° angle to change the search for the appropriate location. At the same time as the
distance and obstacles and other pedestrians close to the distance gradually reduced, the
impact of obstacles on the speed as follows:
speed = speed × (1 −cos t(p)).

Simulation and Analysis
The simulation is evacuated in the form of thermodynamic diagram [11], which shows the
geographical area of the population in a special highlight. According to the above algorithm
and process, simulation and analysis. In a block size of 10 m × 10 m square, divided into 100
square small area, with red dot. The degree of darkness in each small area represents the
number of individuals in the area, that is, the density, the total number of individuals is 500.

Conclusion
Effective evacuation of the crowd is an important link in the protection of social security, in
recent years due to evacuation and the occurrence of stampede more and more accidents.
Through the real-time satellite came the thermodynamic diagram to monitor the gathering
of crowded population, once the bright areas immediately into the evacuation process, the
use of communications devices highlight the area to evacuate. The evacuation model is
combined with particle swarm optimization and thermodynamic diagram, and the improve‐
ment and optimization of the evaluation function and the obstacle avoidance mechanism are
carried out. The feasibility of the model is verified by simulation. In the future study, we
will increase the evacuation guidance factors, group characteristics and dynamic disaster
model in the model, and further study the evacuation process of the crowd under complex
scenes such as disasters. So as to provide a more in-depth and detailed theoretical basis for
the evacuation management of the crowd.
