Q: What's the proper way to paint my front door? 
A: (Brad Staggs, Ask DIY Home Repair expert): Not a lot of people know 
how to paint a front door properly. Follow these steps: 
Materials: 
Slot screw
Sawhorses or sturdy work table
Primer
Caulk 
Putty knife
180-grit sandpaper
Paint
Angled sash paint brush
Four-inch foam roller
1.  Remove the door before you paint. Use a slot screwdriver to 
remove the hinge pins (figure A) and then remove the other half 
of the hinge from the door (figure B). That way, you won't get 
paint on the hinges. Remember the front door will be heavy once 
the hinges are no longer holding it in place, so you might need a 
friend to help you lift it onto some sawhorses. 
2.  Take any other hardware off the door, including the door knocker 
and the peephole, which is usually two snap-together pieces. Also 
make sure you remove the doorknob (figure C) with a screwdriver. 
Usually, you'll need to take out four screws, two that hold in the 
latch and two that hold the doorknob itself. 
3.  Prime all six sides of the door, including the inside, the outside, the 
left and right edges and the top and bottom. Any surfaces you don't 
prime will absorb moisture.

4.  Visually inspect the door for surface cracks and caulk any you see 
(figure D) with a caulk gun and a putty knife. Let the caulk dry 
and re-prime the spot. 
5.  Use a fine-grit sandpaper, such as 180 grit, to sand the surface 
smooth of paint drips and the like, particularly in the crevices of the 
panels (figure E). Then use an old paintbrush or a tack rag to 
brush off the dust from sanding. 
6.  Start painting over the primer with an angled sash brush, painting 
the corners of the raised panels first (figure F). Work from the top 
panels down to the lowest. Don't use too much paint or let the 
paint puddle. 
7.  Use a four-inch roller to apply the paint to the raised panels, rolling 
with the grain of the wood. Remember you'll need several coats. 
8.  The rails are the door boards that come across and the stiles go up 
and down. They meet with a diagonal seam at the corners of the 
door. Make sure you don't paint across that seam. Instead, paint 
the stiles with their grain, which will be up and down, and the rails 
on their grain, which will be side to side, and stop your brush 
stroke (and the roller) at the seam. 
9.  Paint the door with several coats, continuing to use the angle brush 
first and then the roller. You may need even more coats if you're working with a dark color. 
More Questions for Brad: 
Q: I have a door that will not stay open. What could be the problem? 
A: You could have a spring-loaded hinge, which is designed to make the door always shut behind you. If 
you don't like that, replace the spring hinge with an ordinary hinge. If that's not it, chances are your door 
has been hung at an angle, not plumb, and gravity is pulling it shut. If that's the case, you'll need to 
move the hinges in the door so it hangs straight down. 
Q: I can't get my doorbell to ring. I bought a new button for the outside and a whole new system for the 
wall inside. Help! 
A: If you've actually replaced the button and the wall unit indoors, you probably have a wiring problem.

To solve it, you can chase down the wires through the wall, you can run new wires or you can take the 
system back to the store, get your money back and buy a wireless doorbell unit. 
Q: How do you remove mirror tiles that are glued to the wall? 
A: First, make sure you wear gloves, safety eyewear and a long-sleeved shirt to protect you from any 
pieces of glass that fly off the wall. Then use a long-handled scraper to pry the tiles off. Because some 
drywall with probably come off, too, prepare to do some drywall repair at the same time.
