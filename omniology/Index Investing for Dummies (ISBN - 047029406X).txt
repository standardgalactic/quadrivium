About the Author
Russell Wild is a NAPFA-certifi ed fi nancial advisor and the principal of Global 
Portfolios, an investment advisory fi rm based in eastern Pennsylvania. He 
is one of few wealth managers in the nation who is both fee-only (takes no 
commissions) and welcomes clients of both substantial and modest means. 
Wild, in addition to the fun he has with his fi nancial calculator, is also an 
accomplished writer who helps readers understand and make wise choices 
about their money. His articles have appeared in many national publications, 
including AARP The Magazine, Consumer Reports, Men’s Health, and Reader’s 
Digest. He also contributes regularly to professional fi nancial journals, such 
as Wealth Manager and Financial Planning.
The author or coauthor of two dozen nonfi ction books, Wild’s last works, 
prior to the one you’re holding in your hand, were Bond Investing For 
Dummies (Wiley, 2007) and Exchange-Traded Funds For Dummies (Wiley, 
2007). Before those, he wrote The Unofﬁ cial Guide to Getting a Divorce (Wiley, 
2005) along with attorney Susan Ellis Wild, his ex-wife — yeah, you read that 
right. No stranger to the mass media, Wild has shared his wit and wisdom on 
such TV shows as Oprah, The View, CBS Morning News, and Good Day New 
York, and in hundreds of radio interviews.
Wild holds a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree in interna-
tional management and fi nance from the Thunderbird School of Global 
Management in Glendale, Arizona (consistently ranked the #1 school for 
international business by both U.S. News and World Report and The Wall 
Street Journal); a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in business/economics 
magna cum laude from American University in Washington, D.C.; and a 
graduate certifi cate in personal fi nancial planning from  Moravian College in 
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania (America’s sixth-oldest college). A member of the 
National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA) since 2002, Wild 
is also a long-time member and currently serves as president of the American 
Society of Journalists and Authors (ASJA).
The author grew up on Long Island and, after living in various places both 
in the United States and abroad (including France and Morocco), settled in 
Allentown, Pennsylvania where he lives with his two children, Adrienne and 
Clayton, along with Norman, the killer poodle. He spends much of his leisure 
time gardening, bicycling, rereading old Kurt Vonnegut novels, and whisper-
ing sweet little nothings in the ear of his partner, Brenda Lange, also a writer.
Wild’s Web site is www.globalportfolios.net. His e-mail is Russell@

Dedication
To Dennis, who in 1981 sold me 100 shares of the soon-to-go-bankrupt 
Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company. You were my fi rst (and 
last) stockbroker, Dennis, and you taught me everything I ever needed to 
know about stock-picking.
Author’s Acknowledgments
This is the third book for me in the Dummies series, and I’ve had the pleasure 
of working with the same great team each time. The team includes the very 
talented and pleasant Joan Friedman, project editor, and the gregarious 
and also pleasant Marilyn Allen, my agent. It also includes Stacy Kennedy, 
acquisitions editor, and a host of other really good editorial, production, and 
marketing people at Wiley.
New to the team, Ron DeLegge, publisher and editor of www.etfguide.com, 
was kind enough to do the technical editing, and he did it quite superbly. 
Check out Ron’s syndicated The Index Investing Show on radio or podcast: 
www.indexshow.com. You’ll fi nd that I’m a guest on the show from time 
to time.
I’m very thankful to a number of smart and fi nancially savvy colleagues, 
especially among my fellow fee-onlys of the National Association of Personal 
Financial Advisors (NAPFA), who provided helpful input and guidance. 
Several are quoted throughout the pages of this book.
Thanks, too, to the very helpful staff at Morningstar, especially Mark 
Komissarouk, and at the Vanguard Group, especially Rebecca Cohen, for 
sharing their excellent research.
And I’d like to give special thanks to John Bogle, father of index investing, for 
his enormous contributions to the science of fi nance, the contribution he’s 
made (indirectly only) to my own personal fi nances and those of my clients, 
and for so generously lending his time and expertise to this project.

Introduction
S
o you want to be an index investor. Or perhaps you want to be a better 
index investor. This book is for you — but not for you and you alone. 
Even an index-investing agnostic has plenty of reason to read Index Investing 
For Dummies. You see, the lessons of index investing — lessons learned since 
the first index funds were introduced about 35 years ago — are extremely 
important to all investors.
Index investing — investing in entire markets or segments of markets, rather 
than trying to cherry-pick securities — is the financial world’s equivalent of 
Seward’s purchase of Alaska, Henry Ford’s horseless carriage, or milkshake-
machine salesman Ray Croc’s little hamburger stand called McDonald’s. It is 
a stellar example of something that was expected by nearly everyone (includ-
ing the alleged high wizards of finance) to be a miserable flop, and yet, by 
almost any measure imaginable, wound up a rave success.
This book explains why index investing has been such a rave success and, 
more importantly, how you can harness the power of index investing to work 
for you.
About This Book
By the time you have spent a few hours — pleasurable hours, I certainly 
hope — thumbing through the following pages, you’ll know a lot about index 
investing, even more than some professional investors. For right now, I’d like 
to bring home just a few of the virtues of index investing that will make read-
ing this book more than worth your while:
 
✓ Versatility: Index investing gives you the opportunity to build a port-
folio that is well-diversified, extremely low-cost, and fine-tuned to your 
particular needs. Are you an aggressive investor looking for exposure to 
small cap stocks, real estate investment trusts (REITs), or commodities? 
Are you a conservative investor more content with blue chip stocks, 
U.S. Treasury bonds, or high-grade municipal bonds? It doesn’t matter. 
Indexing allows for all flavors of investment.

Index Investing For Dummies 
 
✓ Profitability: Study after study shows that if you invest in index funds 
or predominantly index funds, your long-term returns are very likely to 
far exceed those of most of your neighbors’ with their actively managed 
mutual fund portfolios or individual stock and bond picks. In fact, the odds 
of an actively managed (cherry-picked) portfolio beating an index portfo-
lio are extremely slim. (I know! I know! You’d think that picking cherries 
would give you cherry-like returns. Index investing, admittedly, can be as 
counterintuitive as taking a hot bath to cool off on a steamy August day.)
 
✓ Taxability: Without any question, index investors who buy and hold 
their index funds (the preferred way to invest in indexes) pay far less 
to Uncle Sam than do those with mutual fund portfolios, or portfolios 
of rapidly changing stock holdings. That situation is almost certain 
to continue to be the case regardless of whether the Democrats or 
Republicans take control of the White House or Congress, or which foot-
ball team wins this year’s Super Bowl.
 
✓ Simplicity: You can build a portfolio of index funds that will keep you 
bobbing merrily along in good times and still stay afloat in bad times — 
and you won’t need anything more than this book to do it. In fact, you’ll 
be better off allowing your subscriptions to Easy Money magazine and the 
Fast Bucks financial newsletter to lapse. This book, a simple handheld cal-
culator, and patience are about all you need to be a successful investor.
Ready for more?
Dummies books, such as this one, are written so that you can either plow 
through from beginning to end or, if you prefer, jump from chapter to chap-
ter. Feel free to look though the index (yes, Index Investing For Dummies has 
an index!) for subjects of special interest.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you cruise the pages of this book as smoothly as can be, I use the 
following conventions, probably familiar to all veteran readers of books For 
Dummies:
 
✓ Whenever I introduce a term that is at all jargonish, such as, say, stan-
dard deviation or efficient frontier, the term is set (as you can clearly see) 
in italics. Expect to find a definition or explanation to quickly follow.
 
✓ If I want to share some information that, juicy as it may be, isn’t absolutely 
essential to profitable index investing, I plop it into a sidebar, a darkish 
rectangle or square with its very own heading, set apart from the rest of 
the text. (See how smoothly this italics/definition thing works?)
 
✓ All Web addresses appear in monofont; that makes them easy to find if 
you need to go back and locate one in a jiffy.

 Introduction
Keep in mind that when this book was laid out, some Web addresses may 
have been broken across two lines of text. Wherever that’s the case, rest 
assured that we haven’t put in any hyphens or other thingamabobs to indi-
cate the break. When using one of those broken Web addresses, just type in 
exactly what you see in this book. Pretend as if the line break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
Unless you’re going to be taking a test on index investing, you probably don’t 
need to know everything in this book. Sometimes, I include some fairly tech-
nical information that you don’t have to know in order to be a very successful 
index investor. Or I include some tangential info that you may find interesting 
but that won’t really affect your ability to be a successful index investor. In 
both cases, I tuck this material neatly into the sidebars. Feel free to stop and 
peruse them, or jump right past and keep moving with the main topics. It’s 
your choice!
Foolish Assumptions
If you’re just beginning your education in the world of investments, perhaps 
the best place to start would be Investing For Dummies by Eric Tyson (pub-
lished by Wiley). But the book you’re holding in your hands is only a grade 
above that one in terms of assumptions of investment knowledge and back-
ground. I assume that you are bright, that you have at least a few bucks to 
invest, and that you know some math (and maybe a wee bit of economics) — 
that’s it.
In other words, you don’t need a degree of any sort or years of portfolio man-
agement to be able to follow along. Oh, and for those of you who are already 
fairly savvy investors, perhaps even skilled at building a portfolio of index 
funds, I’m assuming that you, too, can learn quite a bit by reading this book. 
(Oh, you know it all, do you? You may know that international stocks have 
limited correlation to the U.S. stock market, but do you know which kinds 
of international stocks have the lowest correlation, and so provide the most 
powerful diversification? You will after reading Chapter 7!)
How This Book Is Organized
Here’s a rough idea of what your eyes will be feasting on in the following 
pages, laid out juicy part by juicy part.

4
Index Investing For Dummies 
Part I: The (Mostly) Nonviolent 
Indexing Revolution
What is an index, and how did index funds — baskets of investments that 
attempt to track indexes — come to pass? Who were the key players, and 
what motivated them to swim against the strong stream of convention? In 
this first stop in our adventure, I guide you through a short history of index-
ing and walk you through the years to the present. You see how indexing has 
changed over time — in some ways for the better, and in other ways, maybe 
not. You get a better sense of what makes indexing such a potentially power-
ful investment tool and how to best wield that tool.
Next, you meet and greet exchange-traded funds (or portfolios): the latest (and 
in some fashions, greatest) way to build an index portfolio. An exchange-
traded fund is something of a cross between a mutual fund and a stock, and 
as of this writing there are more than 700 of them to choose from.
If you have a great sense of curiosity, or a technical bent, this part ends with 
a discussion of the nuts and bolts of how indexes are actually constructed, 
and how that construction may make some indexes better foundations for 
investments than others.
Part II: Getting to Know Your 
Index Fund Choices
In the second part, this black-and-yellow book starts to get intensely practi-
cal. You get a full primer on the differences between the two major choices 
for index investing: the time-honored mutual fund and the newer and flashier 
exchange-traded fund. I introduce you to the major indexes on which so 
many of these funds are based, as well as some of the more obscure indexes. 
And we look at the people behind the indexes — the builders: who they are, 
and how much you can trust them.
I give you lots of examples of the different kinds of investments that are com-
monly indexed: stocks, bonds, and commodities. In each category of invest-
ment, you find popular index funds (both the best and the worst) compared, 
contrasted, and thoroughly evaluated. There’s a veritable smorgasbord of 
index funds out there, but do you know which are the healthiest pickings?

5
 Introduction
Part III: Drawing a Blueprint 
for Your Index Portfolio
Continuing along in the practical vein of Part II, this part is where I introduce 
the recipes for mixing and matching index funds to form the ultimate port-
folio. (No, a single index fund probably won’t do it.) I talk about brokerage 
firms, where you’ll be housing your index funds. I talk about how many funds 
you’ll need and in roughly what quantity. I talk about what to do if you like 
the idea of index investing but don’t want to limit yourself entirely to index 
investing. (That’s okay, really! There’s not a law against it.) I show you how to 
build a “mixed-marriage” portfolio.
For dessert, I serve up some sample portfolio pies, examples of real portfo-
lios using index funds, or primarily index funds, that you can use as models 
for your own well-tailored investing strategy.
Part IV: Ensuring Happy Returns
An index portfolio that’s just right for you today may no longer be appro-
priate a decade from now. Things change: your age (alas), health, income, 
expenditures, and number of kids in college, for example. A portfolio must 
change along with them. In this part, I outline what kinds of maintenance 
ensure a smooth-running, age-appropriate, profitable portfolio for years 
to come.
If you are a do-it-yourselfer, the information you garner in Chapter 16 is 
essential. If you prefer someone to hold your hand, Chapter 17 reviews the 
various kinds of financial professionals that you might engage — and those 
you are probably best off not engaging.
Part V: The Part of Tens
This standard feature in all For Dummies books rounds out your index-investing 
education with a couple of fun but practical lists, plus an interview with the 
undisputed Father of Indexing, and the man who probably knows more about it 
than anyone on the planet, John Bogle, founder of Vanguard.

Index Investing For Dummies 
Part VI: Appendixes
In this part, I provide handy-dandy lists of the major indexers and index fund 
providers, as well as very helpful resources for further information about 
index investing.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout the margins of this book, you find cute little drawings in circles. 
In the For Dummies world, like in the cyberworld, these are known as icons, 
and they signal certain notable things going on in the accompanying text.
 
Although this is a practical book, you also find some chit and some chat. 
Any paragraph accompanied by this icon, however, tends to be chitless and 
chatless — just pure, unadulterated practicality.
 
The world of index investing — although generally not as risky as some other 
kinds of investing — still provides plenty of opportunity to get whumped. 
Wherever you see the bomb, know that money can be lost by ignoring the 
adjoining advice.
 
Read carefully! This icon indicates that something really important is being 
said and is well worth reading twice to allow your noggin to soak it up.
 
Wall Street is full of people who make money at other people’s expense. 
Where you see the pig face, know that I’m about to point out an instance 
where someone (perhaps even someone calling himself a proponent of index 
investing!) may be digging his plump fingers into your pockets.
Where to Go from Here
Where would you like to go from here? If you would like, start at the begin-
ning. If you’re mostly interested in, say, stock index funds, you are free to 
jump right to Chapter 7. Bond index funds? Go ahead and jump to Chapter 8. 
Commodities? Chapter 9. It’s entirely your call. Maybe start by skimming the 
index at the back of the book.

Part I
The (Mostly) 
Nonviolent 
Indexing 
Revolution

In this part . . .
T
hese first five chapters guide you through the history 
of indexing from its advent through the modern 
era. You discover the reasons that index investing makes 
so much more sense than trying to pick cherries or 
time the markets. You come to understand why index 
investing was so controversial from the start — and 
probably always will be! You find out why the great, 
unwashed masses don’t index — and probably never will. 
(In short, they aren’t as smart as you are, and they are 
more susceptible to Wall Street’s propaganda and the silly 
ramblings of the financial press.) And you are brought 
up to speed on some recent changes in indexes and 
index funds that have really changed the nature of index 
investing forever — in some ways for the better, in some 
ways, for worse.

Chapter 1
What Indexing Is . . . and Isn’t
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering the origin of the index fund
▶ Appreciating the power of passive investing
▶ Getting a glimpse at what makes indexing work
▶ Avoiding the mistakes of the masses
▶ Becoming a truly savvy index investor
W
hen John Bogle started The Vanguard Group in 1974 and shortly 
thereafter introduced the first index fund available to the unwashed 
masses, the brokerage industry and financial press were less than support-
ive. In fact, the entire venture was slathered in mockery. “Bogle’s Folly,” it 
was called. “Un-American” . . . “A sure way to achieve mediocrity.”
Ha!
Bogle wound up getting the last hearty laughs. (You’ll find an intimate dis-
cussion with this undisputed Father of Indexing in Chapter 20.) Vanguard 
Investments is today the largest fund company in the United States. A major-
ity of its stock and bond funds are still index funds. Those index funds have 
gadzillions of dollars in them and long-term track records that put most other 
funds to shame.
Index investors, with Vanguard and other fund companies, have more than 
prospered over the past 35 years as the science of indexing has emerged as 
perhaps the surest way to achieve outsized investment results. While other 
investors (so-called active investors) are busy year-in and year-out meta-
phorically punching and kicking each other silly, index investors (sometimes 
called passive investors) stand calmly on the sidelines, reaping consistently 
far greater rewards.

10
Part I: The (Mostly) Nonviolent Indexing Revolution 
You are about to discover why that is so, how we know it is so beyond any 
shadow of a doubt, and how you can take “Bogle’s Folly” and use it to build 
the leanest, meanest, smartest portfolio possible. You are also about to find 
out how a number of pinstriped Johnnies-come-lately (part of the mixed 
blessing of the exchange-traded fund phenomenon) have terribly compli-
cated the index-investing landscape, making it more important than ever to 
do your investing homework.
Realizing What Makes 
Indexing So Powerful
If index investing is nothing else, it is counterintuitive. Without any difficulty 
whatsoever, I can fully understand why just about the entire brokerage indus-
try and financial press in the mid-1970s thought it was bound to be a flop.
Prior to the mid-1970s, people thought that love beads were cool and bell-
bottoms were hip. They also thought that the road to investment success 
was to be had by hiring a professional manager who could beat the markets. 
Such a manager, with his freshly minted Harvard MBA, would use fancy algo-
rithms, mile-long formulas, and inside information that no one else could har-
vest in order to pick individual stocks that would outshine all other stocks. 
Such a financial wizard could move money in and out of the market at just 
the right time to catch every ascent and avoid every decline. That was the 
belief.
Many people — most people, in fact — still believe that such “active manage-
ment” is the way to win at investing. But prior to 1974, everyone believed it. 
That was before John Bogle came around and anyone bothered to study the 
matter. (A few academic papers on indexing were written prior to Bogle, and 
there was even some dabbling at the institutional level by Wells Fargo and 
American National Bank of Chicago, but the populace was kept in the dark, 
and the funds’ popularity didn’t go far.)
Turning common investing 
knowledge on its head
One of the first studies to raise eyebrows and seriously question the status 
quo came from a guy named Charles D. Ellis, who happens to be a Harvard 
MBA himself. In 1975, he conducted a study of the markets and mutual 

11
 Chapter 1: What Indexing Is . . . and Isn’t
fund performance. Based on his findings, he wrote a groundbreaking article 
entitled “The Loser’s Game.” It originally appeared in the Financial Analysts 
Journal. It later was turned into a book, Winning the Loser’s Game, which was 
published in 1985 by McGraw-Hill and bore some very rough similarity to the 
book you are now reading.
In the 1975 article, addressed to fellow investing professionals, Ellis made the 
following statement:
The investment management business is built upon a simple and basic 
belief: Professional managers can beat the market. That premise appears to 
be false.
At the time, mind you, this was akin to telling a group of Jewish grandmoth-
ers that chicken soup had no medicinal value. Ellis’s position was seen as 
preposterous. And yet Ellis was willing to spoon out the harsh truth. His care-
ful studies revealed that in the prior decade, 85 percent of institutional inves-
tors had underperformed the return of the S&P 500 index.
Ellis’s explanation: Investing is a “loser’s game.” Let me explain what he 
meant by that, and why it has everything to do with indexing.
Playing tennis — poorly — with 
your investments
Charles Ellis’s term, “loser’s game,” comes from an analogy he makes to the 
game of tennis. Picture yourself in a tennis game with your friend, Joe. We’ll 
assume that neither of you is a professional player. Now pick up the ball and 
smack it. Joe will attempt to smack it back to you. You pray as you lunge for 
the ball that your tennis racket will connect with the ball and that you’ll be 
able to smack it back to Joe.
If you and Joe are playing a typical game of amateur tennis, points will be 
gained by one of you simply returning the ball over the net and waiting for the 
other to make a goof. The harder Joe tries to win — the more oomph he puts 
into each swing — the better his chances of hitting the net or sending the little 
green ball out of court, and the better your chances of winning the game.
 
And so, with this analogy, the world was given its first glimpse at the theoreti-
cal underpinning of index investing: Allow the other guys to swing away, trying 
for those cross-court shots, while you content yourself with simply not making 
mistakes. In almost every case, you’ll eventually win.

12
Part I: The (Mostly) Nonviolent Indexing Revolution 
Making gains by avoiding mistakes
What Ellis was talking about was investing success through indexing. That is, 
by “buying the market” rather than trying to cherry-pick securities, you may 
not profit from putting a big portion of your portfolio into the next Microsoft, 
but you won’t lose by putting a big portion of your portfolio into the next 
Bear Stearns, either. Instead, you’ll own modest positions in both — along 
with lots and lots of other stocks — and your portfolio will grow, steadily and 
surely, along with the market at large.
Not everyone is as smart as you are: 
Most investors still fool themselves
Although there has been a veritable explosion in 
the popularity of index investing, especially since 
the mid-1990s with the advent of exchange-
traded funds, the vast majority of investors are 
still trying to beat the markets — and consis-
tently failing to do so — with actively managed 
portfolios. There are currently about 1,000 index 
funds (index mutual funds and exchange-traded 
funds) available to U.S. investors. That compares 
to about 6,500 actively managed mutual funds.
The total amount of dollars invested in index 
funds is about $1.5 trillion, compared to roughly 
$7.7 trillion in actively managed funds. That 
translates to about 84 percent of all fund invest-
ments being in actively managed funds. And 
these figures do not reflect the scores of inves-
tors who invest willy-nilly in individual stocks, 
often recommended by their brothers-in-law, 
who tend to do the worst of all.
Amount invested
in index funds:
$1.5 trillion (16 percent)
Amount invested in
actively managed funds:
$7.7 trillion (84 percent)

13
 Chapter 1: What Indexing Is . . . and Isn’t
 
By investing in a fund that tracks an entire index (such as the S&P 500 or the 
Wilshire 5000), you’ll be the guy on the tennis court who simply returns the 
ball. Your friend Joe, by picking individual stocks or hiring expensive fund 
managers to do it for him, will be trying to smack the ball within an inch of the 
net. You’ll win. Trust me. You’ll win.
More specifically, here’s what makes index investing work:
 
✓ Lower — much, much lower — management costs: Those profes-
sional money managers who run most mutual funds don’t come cheap. 
According to the latest numbers from Morningstar, the average actively 
run mutual fund now charges an annual management fee of 1.29 percent, 
and that figure does not include any of the hideous additional sales 
charges or loads charged by many of those funds. The typical index 
mutual fund, in contrast, charges a yearly management of 0.76 percent, 
and almost never any kind of sales charge. The average exchange-traded 
fund (almost all of which are index funds) carries an expense ratio of 
0.56 percent. But many index funds can be had for expense ratios of less 
than 0.20 percent — less than 1/6 the management fee of an actively 
managed fund.
 
✓ Lower everything costs: It isn’t only the management fees that matter. 
Because they simply mirror indexes, index funds don’t have to pay for 
all kinds of research. They don’t have to pay to trade securities. They 
don’t do a lot of advertising. In sum total, Charles Ellis reckoned 30 
years ago that the average index fund can be run for about 2 percent 
less a year than the average actively managed fund. Analysts today say 
that the 2 percent spread is still a pretty accurate number.
 
 Now, 2 percent may not sound like a lot, but think about it: If the market 
returns 10 percent a year over the next X years, your active-fund man-
ager is going to have to get consistent annual returns of 12 percent for 
you, the poor little investor, in order for you to just break even. Your 
fund manager is going to have to beat the market by a full 20 percent a 
year, or you lose. How many fund managers can do that? Very few.
 
✓ Gentler taxation: Even if your active-fund manager does manage to beat 
the indexes by 20 percent a year, doing so will likely involve a lot of 
buying and selling of securities. That brings up taxes. As any owner of 
an actively managed fund can attest, those taxes can be burdensome. I 
discuss how burdensome, and talk more about the tax-cost differences 
between actively managed and index funds, in Chapter 3.

14
Part I: The (Mostly) Nonviolent Indexing Revolution 
 
✓ More honesty, more openness. Want to avoid unpleasant surprises (in 
addition to unexpected year-end taxes)? When you invest in an index 
fund, you won’t find your fund managers looking for window dressing in 
December — those last-minute purchases made for the sole purpose of 
helping the fund’s annual returns look better than they actually were. 
And you won’t be enticed to buy an index fund, as you may be enticed 
to buy an actively managed fund, by a salesman posing as a “financial 
planner” who stands to make a big, fat commission off you. Nor will you 
buy a fund with a name that implies one kind of investment (such as U.S. 
stocks) but invests in all kinds of other things (such as, say, Russian 
stocks). With index funds, you know exactly what you’re getting. There’s 
much more information on these kinds of nonmonetary-related benefits 
of index funds in Chapter 3.
 
✓ Proven results: Perhaps the greatest reason to buy index funds is that 
they have such an impressive track record. Maybe you don’t want to 
know why indexing works. Guess what? You really don’t have to. Is it 
important that you understand how the nerves at the ends of your fin-
gers tell your brain to yank your hand away from a hot stove (the neu-
rotransmitters and proteins and all that stuff)? No. The important thing 
is that the nerve endings and the brain do communicate. And with index 
funds, the important thing is that analysts who have compared and con-
trasted index fund performance to the performance of actively managed 
mutual funds generally come to the same conclusion: Index funds are 
superior.
In Chapter 3, I give you all the cold numbers — return rates from across the 
investment universe over different time frames — so you can clearly see that 
investing in index funds is a time-proven, successful strategy.
Not All Indexing Is Created Equal
Although this first chapter — and, in fact, this entire book — may read as 
something of an ode to index investing, rest assured that I’m not trying to sell 
you anything. In fact, your having bought this book indicates to me that you 
were probably sold on index investing long before you and I ever met. More 
than likely, what you’re hoping to get out of Index Investing For Dummies are 
tips to become a better index investor. You won’t be disappointed. I promise!
Although it’s not rocket science, and it’s certainly something you can do on 
your own, index investing does require some knowledge. Not all indexes are 
created equal, not all index funds are created equal, and mixing and matching 
various index funds is crucial to portfolio success. It helps, too, to understand 
your own financial situation and to pick the optimal index funds for you.

15
 Chapter 1: What Indexing Is . . . and Isn’t
Picking your level of market exposure
Some index funds are based on huge indexes, with hundreds or even thou-
sands of stocks or bonds, all across the board. For example, funds that are 
based on the very popular S&P 500 index give you exposure to 500 large 
stocks spread out among many industries. A fund such as the iShares Dow 
Jones U.S. Total Market gives you even a broader exposure to the markets. 
There are also index funds that in a flash can give you exposure to broad for-
eign stock markets or the entire U.S. bond market.
Some index funds are narrower, tracking indexes that capture only a sliver of 
the financial markets. Many of the newer exchange-traded funds fit into this 
category. Some may track certain industry sectors, such as energy or tech-
nology, or industry subsectors such as retail banking or home construction. 
Others may track certain very specific kinds of stocks, such as those that 
pay high dividends. An extreme example is the WisdomTree Japan SmallCap 
Dividend Fund, which tracks an index of small Japanese companies that pay 
high dividends.
 
In general, the larger the index tracked by the index fund (in other words, the 
more securities represented by the index), the greater the diversification and 
the less the risk to you — but also the less potential return.
Knowing that indexes have various recipes
Some index funds are based on traditional indexes, such as the S&P 500, 
which allot stocks to the index based on their relative size. But indexes can 
be formulated any number of ways, and some make a lot more sense than 
others. Rather popular these days, for example, are equal-weighted indexes 
(which may or may not make sense, depending on your objective) and 
fundamentally weighted indexes (which can make enormous sense or not, 
depending on the economic fundamentals employed). I discuss these options 
in-depth in Chapter 5 and then elaborate further throughout Part II.
Of utmost importance, regardless of how any index is formulated, is cost. 
Some index funds cost you very little — in the case of certain index offerings 
from Fidelity and Vanguard, as little as 0.07 percent a year. (It’s even less for 
institutional investors, should you happen to own an insurance company or 
bank!) Other offerings from other index fund providers defeat a major benefit 
of indexing and wind up costing you 0.95 percent in management fees a year.
The entire Part II of this book is devoted to helping you pick the best of the 
best — in price and all other ways — from the 1,000 or so index funds available.

16
Part I: The (Mostly) Nonviolent Indexing Revolution 
Selecting what works best for you
Ah, but even when I show you which index funds are better than others, you 
still have homework to do. That’s because some index funds may be perfect 
for you, and others may be better for someone else. As with any other invest-
ment, you have to figure out your financial goals and your level of risk toler-
ance before you spend your money. The personal aspects of index investing 
are addressed in depth in Part III.
I am often asked, for example, whether I think a certain index fund is “good.” 
Well, it often depends. For example, an index fund such as the Vanguard REIT 
ETF (VNQ), which gives exposure to the real estate industry, may make great 
sense for your one neighbor, the dentist, but little sense for another neighbor 
who is in the real estate business and already has much of his financial fate 
tied up in this one industry. The iShares Russell Microcap Index fund (IWC) 
may make great sense for someone who can justify adding volatility to his 
portfolio. For someone looking to edge toward more conservative invest-
ments, the iShares Lehman Aggregate Bond Fund (AGG) may be a much 
better choice.
The great news is that you have a wealth of choices among the truly good 
index funds, so chances are you can tailor the portfolio of your dreams with-
out having to step outside the realm of index investing.
Becoming an Ultra-Savvy Index Investor
Picking the best index funds is a crucial part of being the best index investor 
you can be, for sure. But there’s more to it than that. You also want to know 
how to mix and match your index funds for maximum diversification. If you 
want to include a few actively managed funds in your portfolio, you also want 
to know how to best mix and match those with your index funds. These are 
areas of discussion that I tackle in depth in the latter chapters of Part III.
You also discover there how to place your fund purchases in the right 
accounts, be they taxable accounts or tax-advantaged accounts, such as 
IRAs. The goal, despite your level of patriotism, is to keep your taxes as low 
as possible and, as a direct corollary, to boost your after-tax returns.
In Part IV, you read about the virtues of buying and holding, and how 
index funds are the perfect vehicles for a buy-and-hold strategy. Mind you, 
exchange-traded funds (nearly all of which are index funds) make for great 
tools if you want to day-trade. But I would suggest doing so only if you have 
nerves of steel, can take great chances, and are reconciled to losing money! A 
buy-and-hold strategy makes tremendously more sense, and I show you why.

 Chapter 1: What Indexing Is . . . and Isn’t
Investing with realistic expectations
Studies show rather conclusively that long-term investors do much better in 
index funds than actively managed funds (see Chapter 3 for specifics). Even 
a rather lazy index investor, one who picks his indexes willy-nilly, is still very 
likely to wind up in the top 40 percent of investors after 10 years, and the top 
20 percent after 20 years.
The truly savvy index investor, one who buys the lowest cost index funds 
and knows how to mix and match index funds for good diversification, can 
expect to be in the top 20 percent of all investors over the next 10 years, and 
the top 10 percent over the next 20 years. These are all ballpark estimates, of 
course.
A caveat: Index investors of any ilk will rarely be in the top 1 percent of inves-
tors, either in the short-run or the long-run. The truly remarkable returns are 
reserved for inside traders (those who don’t wind up in jail); extremely lucky 
gamblers who bet on small positions and win (thereby avoiding living on the 
street); and (probably the smallest number) the true stock-picking geniuses, 
such as billionaire investor Warren Buffett (although Buffett himself has 
numerous times recommended indexing for most investors).
Becoming an enlightened (and just
maybe rich!) index investor
So how to become the kind of savvy investor who will leave 90 percent of 
other investors in the dust? Read the remaining 300 pages of Index Investing 
For Dummies! Don’t be afraid to change your thinking, or the way you’ve 
always invested before. Understand that market success — like spiritual 
enlightenment in the Buddhist tradition — can’t be forced. It comes with time 
and patience, and often going with the flow.
In the Buddhist tradition, your patience and wisdom eventually allow you 
to become one with the entire universe. In index investing, patience and 
wisdom lead you to become one with the entire market. It’s an exciting and 
potentially very rewarding journey that John Bogle first charted, and I look 
forward to taking you there!

and Index Investing
In This Chapter
▶ Who was Charles Dow, and why should you care?
▶ Tipping a hat to the Mother of All Indexes
▶ Knowing something about the evolution of the index
▶ Taking indexing to prime time
I
n Chapter 1, I talk a bit about John Bogle, Vanguard, and the birth of the 
very first index fund. But just as McDonald’s needed a cow before it could 
make a hamburger, and Picasso needed a canvas before he could paint the 
Mona Lisa, you need an index before you can make an index fund. I now 
invite you to join me on a trip back in time, back to the late 19th century, 
when Picasso, who did not actually paint the Mona Lisa (I was just testing 
you), was a mere lad, and Ronald McDonald wasn’t even yet a glimmer in his 
parents’ clownish eyes.
At that time, Charles Dow, a serious-looking, 40-something man with a bushy 
black beard and wide lapels, got it in his noggin that the world, which already 
had canvases and cows, needed an index.
The year was 1896. (Harvard historians tell us that nothing else happened 
that year.) The place was New York City. The time was . . . heck, I don’t know.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average: 
Mother of All Indexes
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, or DJIA — often referred to simply as the 
Dow — is 113 years old as of this writing. That makes it the nation’s longest-
lived index, which is to say a standard measure of the stock market’s perfor-
mance. It’s also an enormously popular index. Still.

20
Part I: The (Mostly) Nonviolent Indexing Revolution 
In fact, any discussion of the financial markets on television or the Internet 
treats the latest rise or fall in the Dow much as The Weather Channel treats 
changes in the temperature: No report would be complete without it. Millions 
of people every day watch the ups and downs of Charles Dow’s creation.
The mechanics of the oldest existing index
The T. Rex and brachiosaurus had already died off by the time Charles Dow 
and his bushy beard came along to give us the Dow Jones Industrial Average, 
but handheld calculators were still decades in the future, never mind the 
Excel spreadsheet. Financial indexes — like life itself — were perforce consid-
erably simpler than they are today.
The Dow, for example, started with 12 big companies in 12 important indus-
tries of the time (cotton, leather, cattle feed, railroads, and such). The price 
of a single share of stock in each of these 12 companies was then added up 
on a piece of paper (603/8 + 525/8 + 357/8 + 451/2 and so on), and then the sum 
total was divided (long-hand, ouch) by 12. On May 26, 1896, the very first 
day the index was published, the sum of share prices was 491.28, which was 
divided by 12 to yield 40.94. That was where the Dow first opened.
Long-lasting popularity
Had CNBC been around back in May, 1896, a very attractive young woman 
named Martha or Gertrude or Emmeline, with lots of makeup and wearing 
fashionable puffed sleeves and floral trimmings, would have smiled into the 
camera and said, “The Dow closed today at 40.94, neither up or down from 
yesterday’s close, since — ha! ha! — the Dow didn’t exist yesterday.”
Today, the woman’s name may be Sue or Becky or Cheng. Cheng can com-
pare the Dow today not only to yesterday’s average but to many yesterdays’ 
averages. (She can then interview some balding, boring white guy in a Brooks 
Brothers suit, who will happily speculate on tomorrow’s average.) But the 
Dow remains essentially the same beast it always was. Indexes such as the 
Dow, based simply on the price of the stocks that make up the index, divided 
by the number of stocks, are called price-weighted indexes.
Even though Cheng quotes one every 5 seconds, price-weighted indexes are, 
in many ways, as archaic as the name Emmeline.

21
 Chapter 2: A Short History of the Index and Index Investing 
Mama has a few shortcomings
Mind you, the Dow never was — if I may use a technical term — the cat’s 
meow. After all, how can a mere dozen stocks represent the entire stock 
market? And then you add in the price-weighting, and what you have is, basi-
cally, cat dander. What’s wrong with the way the Dow is weighted? Lots.
Index weightings
I have plenty to say later in this book about the way various indexes are for-
mulated. But for now, I’ll ask you to imagine an index with but two stocks, 
which we will call, for no particular reason, BAG and BOX. Suppose that BAG 
sells for $10 a share, and BOX sells for $50 a share. If this index were the Dow, 
the average would be the sum of BAG and BOX ($10 + $50 = $60) divided by 
the number of stocks in the index (2). Hence, the DJIA would be 30. Now 
Charles Dow: Creator of the index, founder of 
The Wall Street Journal
He was born on a farm in Connecticut in 1851 
but had a strong aversion to dirt and manure. So 
as a very young man, without any formal educa-
tion, Charles Dow began working as a reporter 
for various rags in southern New England. He 
gravitated to business reporting and, at age 29, 
headed to where the action was: the Big Apple. 
Granted, it wasn’t all that big an apple in those 
days, but it was a heck of a lot bigger than any-
thing in southern New England.
Dow found work at the Kiernan Wall Street 
Financial News Bureau, which hand-delivered 
handwritten financial news blurbs to New 
York bankers and brokers. After two years at 
Kiernan, Dow buddied up with a colleague, 
Edward Jones, and the two 30-something men 
spun off a competing news bureau called Dow, 
Jones & Company. They operated out of the 
basement of a candy store, publishing a two-
page summary of the day’s financial news 
called the Customers’ Afternoon Letter. It was 
in that “letter” that the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average first appeared in 1896.
The two-page flyer, within little time, evolved 
into a real newspaper called The Wall Street 
Journal, initially selling for two Indian-head 
pennies a copy. Today, the paper sells for $1.50 
a pop. And just weeks prior to my sitting down 
to write this chapter, the venerable paper was 
taken over by Rupert Murdoch, the Australian-
born financier famous for his crass and cheesy 
tabloids featuring “sexy sports girls” and up-to-
the-minute coverage of the life of Paris Hilton.
One can only wonder what Connecticut farm 
boy Charles Dow, who never liked manure very 
much, would think.

22
Part I: The (Mostly) Nonviolent Indexing Revolution 
suppose that BAG stock goes up a dollar to $11. You can see that using the 
same formula, the index will rise to ($11 + $50)/2 = 30.5. The index would be 
the very same — 30.5 — if BOX rose a dollar, from $50 to $51.
 
Do you see the problem yet? If BAG goes up a dollar (from $10 to $11) that 
represents a hefty 10 percent climb in value. If BOX goes up a dollar (from $50 
to $51) that represents a climb in value of only 2 percent. Obviously, investors 
with equal holdings in BAG and BOX would be much, much better off if BAG 
goes up a dollar than if BOX goes up a dollar. Yet in both cases, the price-
weighted index goes up by the same degree: 1.66 percent. So to the extent that 
an index is a measure of investors’ (and the market’s) success, the Dow can be 
a rather crappy measure.
Mother’s little helpers
Largely because of these two serious shortcomings — the small number of 
securities in the Dow and the way it is weighted (although there are other 
shortcomings to consider later) — the Mother of All Indexes has given way to 
a number of “children,” many of which are superior in a number of ways.
You’ll recognize the names of many of these indexes: Wilshire, Morningstar, 
Lehman, MSCI, FTSE, Russell (hey, that’s my name!). But the most popular of 
the post-Dow indexes, by far, is the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, commonly 
known as the S&P 500 or simply the S&P. I describe the S&P briefly in the fol-
lowing pages and talk about it, and the other indexes mentioned here, more 
throughout the book.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, 1896
When Charles Dow came up with his origi-
nal index of 12 companies, the following 
names were as familiar to most Americans as 
Microsoft and McDonald’s are today. Note that 
General Electric is the only one of the bunch still 
included in the index. All the others have since 
died out (such as the U.S. Leather Company); 
were busted up by (pre-Ronald Reagan) anti-
trust legislation (American Tobacco Company); 
or have since been swallowed by other corpo-
rations (United States Rubber Company, which 
became Uniroyal, which merged with B.F. 
Goodrich, which was eventually bought up by 
Michelin).

 ✓ American Sugar Company
 ✓ American Tobacco Company
 ✓ Chicago Gas Company
 ✓ Distilling & Cattle Feeding Company
 ✓ General Electric
 ✓ Laclede Gas Light Company
 ✓ National Lead Company
 ✓ North American Company (electric power)

Company

 Chapter 2: A Short History of the Index and Index Investing 
 
Over the years, indexes have come to serve as more than ways of measuring 
market performance. They have also become common benchmarks that serve 
to measure the performance of investment managers. And they have come to 
serve as the foundation for investments themselves — accessible to the inves-
tor through index funds. An index fund is simply a fund that tracks an index. 
Track is a somewhat fancy word for “ape.” If, say, a DJIA index fund is true to 
its name, it will hold the very same stocks that make up the Dow.
When the inventor of the wheel did his (or her) thing, I’m sure that (s)he had 
no idea that the invention would one day serve to move millions of people 
in obnoxiously huge SUVs along the highways and byways of the modern 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, today
The Dow dozen has since become the Dow 30, 
and you’re undoubtedly familiar with most, if not 
all, of the large U.S. companies that you cur-
rently see on the list. The editors at The Wall 
Street Journal shake up the index once or twice 
every few years and will substitute one com-
pany for another. Presumably, their methodol-
ogy involves more than flipping a coin, but only 
they are privy to what goes into the decision. 
The last changes prior to the publication of this 
book were the February, 2008 additions of Bank

Kraft Foods to replace American International 
Group.

world. When Charles Dow created the first index, I’m sure he had no idea that 
it would give birth not only to hundreds of indexes, but thousands of invest-
ment portfolios upon which millions of people would build their nest eggs!
The S&P 500: The Dow’s Undisputed 
Number-One Son
The Standard & Poor’s 500 (S&P 500, or simply the S&P) has become as popu-
lar with the media, and certainly within the investment world, as the Dow 
itself. It is clearly a better mousetrap where indexing serves as a measure of 
the market. It’s also a better benchmark against which to measure the perfor-
mance of investment managers. In fact, it’s a superior index all-around than 
the Dow, but it is not perfect; no index is perfect.
Linear charts and logarithmic charts: 
What’s the difference?
Either way you choose to view it, the long-term 
growth of the S&P 500 index has been quite 
impressive. If you look at a linear chart (see the 
first figure in this sidebar), the growth seems 
even more dramatic than it does on a logarith-
mic chart (shown in the second figure). The 
two kinds of charts simply use different lenses 
to view growth.

 Chapter 2: A Short History of the Index and Index Investing 
The S&P 500 was born in 1957, making it roughly the same age as the author 
of this book — old. Unlike the even older Dow, which today includes 30 
stocks, the S&P 500 includes — surprise! surprise! — 500 stocks. Very much 
like the Dow, however, those stocks are predominantly large cap U.S. com-
pany stocks. Large cap means “large capitalization,” which, on Wall Street, 
refers to a company worth at least $5 billion.
According to Standard & Poor’s,
The 500 companies chosen for the S&P 500 Index are not the largest com-
panies in terms of market value, but rather, tend to be leaders in important 
industries within the U.S. economy.
The linear chart measures absolute change in 
price over time. The S&P hardly seems to move 
up in the early years. That’s because there 
weren’t all that many dollars invested in the 
market. A rise or fall of 10 percent over a year 
equated to only a few extra bucks won or lost. 
A rise or fall of 10 percent in more recent days 
equated to many more bucks won or lost.
The logarithmic chart measures percentage 
change over time. A rise or fall in the S&P of 10 
percent looks the same whether that 10 percent 
rise or fall occurred 50 years ago or yesterday.
Linear charts, in my mind, are fine for making 
short-term comparisons. Logarithmic charts, I 
believe, allow for a more accurate view when 
measuring performance over decades.
Of course, the two kinds of charts are often 
used and misused, depending on how the 
creator of the charts hopes to impress you. If 
I wanted you to invest in my product, for exam-
ple, I would likely show you a linear chart when 
talking about return. I would prefer that you see 
a logarithmic chart when talking about volatility. 
It all stems from the very same data, but presen-
tation is everything!

In the case of certain companies, however, such as the $450 billion Exxon 
Mobil (the largest company on the list), market value alone would probably 
warrant a place on the list, even if oil were not such an important industry.
New generation, new mechanics
Unlike the Dow, which is price-weighted, the S&P 500 is an example of a market 
value–weighted index. That means that each stock’s weight in the index is pro-
portionate to its market value. Larger, more valuable companies (like Exxon 
Mobil and General Electric) are given a larger representation in the index than 
smaller companies (such as American Express and Walt Disney).
The S&P is also (as of 2005) a float-weighted index, which means that only 
those shares of stock that float — are available for public sale — are counted 
in the index. Some rather large companies, such as Berkshire Hathaway, have 
a good percentage of their stock tied up in private hands and, therefore, may 
never make it onto the S&P 500. In Chapter 5, and throughout Part II, I discuss 
how the ways in which various indexes are calculated may greatly affect any 
investments that track them.
 
In part because the S&P is so popular and has been around longer than just 
about all other indexes, its particular method of weighting its components 
is considered the most “normal” weighting method by most people in the 
finance industry. And indexes that work like the S&P, or somewhat like the 
S&P, are commonly called traditional indexes.
The S&P today (still) rules 
the indexing roost
There are many investments — both index mutual funds and exchange-traded 
funds — that track the S&P 500. In fact, there are far more funds that track the 
S&P 500 (both officially and unofficially) than any other index, including the 
Dow. According to industry figures, there is more money in index funds that 
track the S&P — index funds made up of the 500 S&P stocks — than in all other 
index funds combined!
The S&P is also, far and away, the most commonly used benchmark against 
which investment managers’ performance is weighed. A successful invest-
ment manager will have “beaten the index” (meaning the S&P) for one, three, 
and five years running. Unsuccessful managers “fall behind the index.” This 
is often a silly benchmark for success because large cap U.S. stocks do not 
represent the entire universe of investments. But it is what it is; lots of things 
in this world are silly.

27
 Chapter 2: A Short History of the Index and Index Investing 
As I explain in Chapter 4, the use and misuse of certain indexes (such as the 
S&P) as benchmarks serves to muddy the waters and often makes the value 
of index investing more difficult to see. I promise to unmuddy the waters to 
the best of my ability!
Beyond the Dow and the S&P
As great an improvement as the S&P was over the Dow, no one index can be 
all things to all people. That’s why we have a plethora of indexes, many of 
which have come into being in the past several years. The silliness I refer to 
in the previous section can often be eradicated through the use of different 
indexes for different purposes.
Today, for example, we have indexes that measure collective returns among 
small cap stocks, value stocks, growth stocks, and stocks in certain industry 
sectors. I introduce these in Chapters 6 and 7. Other indexes measure returns 
and serve as appropriate benchmarks in fixed-income markets; I discuss 
these in Chapter 8. Yet other indexes measure performance and serve as 
good benchmarks in commodity and real estate markets; see Chapter 9. And 
there are all kinds of indexes that track markets overseas, too — Chapter 7 
offers a sampling.
For just about any index, you can buy a fund today that tracks it. That’s espe-
cially true since the advent of exchange-traded funds, which in the past sev-
eral years alone have tripled the number of index funds available. I introduce 
exchange-traded funds, and fully explain the differences between exchange-
traded funds and mutual funds, in Chapter 5.
Indexes of various shapes and sizes
Within each broad category of indexes (large stocks, small stocks, bonds), 
there are numerous variations of indexes, formulated in numerous fashions 
to meet different goals. The price weighting of the Dow and the market value 
weighting of the S&P are only two methods among many for formulating 
indexes. There are also equal-weighted indexes, in which all components 
affect the index to the same degree. There are fundamental-weighted indexes, 
in which individual components may be given importance by any number of 
financial considerations, including growth rate or dividend yield. And there 
are even now some indexes that change so often that they may qualify as 
actively managed indexes. Talk about an oxymoron!

28
Part I: The (Mostly) Nonviolent Indexing Revolution 
Indexes also vary by the numbers of companies included (30 for the Dow, 
500 for the S&P, 5,000 for the Wilshire 5000, and so on); by the size (capital-
ization) of the average company in the index; or by how often the index is 
changed.
Index investing’s icons
Years and years after educated folk realized 
that the earth was round, most of the world still 
insisted it was flat. It took Copernicus, Galileo, 
Magellan, and Columbus to prove otherwise. 
Today, although most educated folk realize 
that index investing works, and works well, 
there are still plenty and plenty of flat-earthers 
out there. With any luck, Russell Wild’s Index 
Investing For Dummies may cause a few of the 
flat-earthers to see the light. But there have 
certainly been a few well-read authors and vol-
umes on index investing long before this book 
was published, or even before this author had 
ever heard of index investing.
As the writings and experiences of Copernicus, 
Galileo, Magellan, and Columbus were to 
the eventual acceptance by most that the 
earth is round, the writings of Bogle, Malkiel, 
Samuelson, and Ellis have been similarly pow-
erful in the promotion of index investing.
 ✓ John Bogle: Founder of Vanguard 
Investments. Wrote his first paper on index 
investing while a student at Princeton 
University, from which he graduated in 
1951. Bogle has since written, and contin-
ues to write, many articles and books on the 
subject. Followers of index investing some-
times call themselves Bogleheads, a term 
of endearment. Bogle rhymes with mogul.
 ✓ Burton G. Malkiel: Princeton University pro-
fessor. He wrote the book A Random Walk 
Down Wall Street (Norton, 1973), which 
has become the closest thing index invest-
ing has to a bible. Here’s a quote from that 
book: “This complexity suggests that there 
is no longer any room for the individual 
investor in today’s institutionalized markets. 
Nothing could be farther from the truth. You 
can do as well as the experts — perhaps 
even better.”
 ✓ Paul Samuelson: Economist. Nobel Prize 
winner. Wrote Economics, the classic 
textbook (updated many times) that I used 
in college. He also wrote “Challenge to 
Judgment,” an article that appeared in The 
Journal of Portfolio Management in the fall 
of 1974. At that time, Samuelson wrote: “[A]t
the least, some large foundation [should] 
set up an in-house portfolio that tracks the 
S&P 500 Index — if only for the purpose 
of setting up a naive model against which 
their in-house gunslingers can measure 
their prowess . . . .”
 ✓ Charles D. Ellis: Investment analyst. Wrote 
the seminal article “The Loser’s Game,” 
which appeared in the Financial Analysts 
Journal, July/August 1975. Ellis conducted 
the first widely covered study on index 
investing. Here was Ellis’s conclusion from 
that study: “The investment management 
business is built upon a simple and basic 
belief: Professional managers can beat the 
market. That premise appears to be false.” 
The study has been replicated many times.

 Chapter 2: A Short History of the Index and Index Investing 
I discuss these differences in some depth — and explain how they may affect 
an index investor’s risk and potential return — in Part II. Also covered, of 
course, will be the ways to find the best index funds to match a particular 
index.
Indexing gone amok?
 
In case you’re wondering, I am an advocate of index investing and am an index 
investor myself! That being said, some of the newer indexes and index funds 
are, to put it bluntly, just plain dumb. I’m talking primarily about indexes 
that were whipped up specifically so that an investment vehicle (usually an 
exchange-traded fund) could be sold that would track that specific index. 
Smart for the seller. Often dumb for the buyer/investor.
As I detail in the next chapter, most index investors are going to be more suc-
cessful than most non-index investors. But I will qualify this by saying that 
not all index investing is something to write home about.
Growing Numbers of Fund Companies, 
More and More Indexing Options
I’ve talked in this chapter about the history of indexing, how indexes have 
gotten more sophisticated and varied over the years, and how the number 
of indexes used by financial professionals has grown from a handful to an 
Astrodome-full. No surprise, then, that the number of companies offering 
index funds has exploded as well.
Indexing goes institutional
Prior to the mid-1970s, the only way you could possibly be in index investor 
was to buy, say, all 500 stocks of the S&P 500 yourself — not an easy proposi-
tion at all!
American National Bank in Chicago and Wells Fargo founded the very first 
index funds, but they were available only to institutional investors, and even 
among those, there was little interest.

30
Part I: The (Mostly) Nonviolent Indexing Revolution 
In 1975, John Bogle started Vanguard Investments and offered the first index 
fund — the First Index Investment Trust (which mirrored the S&P 500) — to 
the general public.
As Bogle often points out in his writing and speeches, Fidelity Investments 
Chairman Edward C. Johnson III gave little indication that his brokerage 
house would ever follow suit. “I can’t believe,” Johnson told the press, “that 
the great mass of investors are [sic] going to be satisfied with just receiving 
average returns. The name of the game is to be the best.”
But that attitude didn’t last very long — not after Bogle’s baby started to 
appear successful, both in grabbing customers and in showing some rather 
impressive returns.
Eating crow, and creating new funds
Of course, Fidelity wound up offering not only one index fund but, starting in 
1988, many index funds. So did T. Rowe Price, starting in 1990. And Charles 
Schwab, in 1991. And nearly every other major brokerage house in the world 
since that time has added at least an index fund or two.
There are now roughly 300 index mutual funds available from dozens of 
mutual fund companies. And there are about 700 exchange-traded funds 
available from multiple companies, including Vanguard, Barclays Global 
Investors (which purchased Wells Fargo indexing operations), and State 
Street Global Advisors.
Another big player on the indexing scene, Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA), 
was started by two of the same men — David Booth and Rex Sinquefield — 
who built the very first index funds in the early 1970s for American National 
Bank and Wells Fargo.
In Chapter 10, I offer specific recommendations for where and how to shop 
for index products among so many sellers.

 Chapter 2: A Short History of the Index and Index Investing 
The five largest index funds
All told, a cool $1.5 trillion is now invested in 
about 1,000 index funds. But some of those 
index funds are much larger than others. The 
five largest index funds alone account for 
nearly one-fifth of all the money invested in 
index funds.

f you’ve been to enough financial luncheons, you know that the quality 
of the meal served has nothing to do with the quality of the product or 
service being sold. In fact, the opposite is true. Attend a lunchtime lecture 
given by a salesman hawking high-priced variable annuities of very dubious 
financial value, and you can expect veal cheeks with herb mashed potatoes, 
onion–portobello confit, and grilled asparagus in merlot sauce. Attend a 
lunchtime lecture given by someone selling index funds, and you’ll get a 
hamburger with ketchup, and fries.
Index funds are the better mousetrap and, as such, don’t need to be sold. 
Their track record alone moves them off the shelves. In addition, the people 
who sell them don’t make a large enough margin to afford to serve you veal 
cheeks — whatever veal cheeks are. Index fund providers usually charge you 
pennies, or at most dimes, in comparison to the dollars charged by the pro-
viders of actively managed funds.
In this chapter, I discuss the very impressive track records of index funds, 
and I explain how those track records were achieved. Yes, the low cost has 
very much to do with it.
Lunch, if you’re hungry, will be served in 20 minutes.

Part I: The (Mostly) Nonviolent Indexing Revolution 
Clocking Impressive Returns, 
Year after Year
Measuring the success of index funds is not a precise science. In fact, it is 
tricky business indeed. Different studies show different results. But we’re 
talking mostly a matter of degrees here. The vast majority of studies that 
compare active investing to passive (index) investing — and there have been 
many — come to the same conclusion: Indexing wins hands down.
Of all the number-crunchers in the financial world, those at Morningstar 
arguably have the most experience. Morningstar is also an independent third 
party: It does produce indexes, but it sells neither index funds nor actively 
managed funds. Following are the stats that Morningstar’s analysts give as 
the overall track record for index funds versus actively managed funds over 
the past 5 and 15 years.
Note that the term index funds includes both mutual funds and exchange-
traded funds. All figures are current as of December 31, 2007.
Intermediate-term index fund 
performance results: Good!
Per Morningstar, here are the five-year performance results:
 
✓ Overall average yearly return of all actively managed funds, past five 
years: 11.83 percent
 
✓ Overall average yearly return of all index funds, past five years: 13.61 
percent
 
✓ Percent by which the index funds have outshined the actively managed 
funds in the past five years: 15.0 percent
 
✓ Value today of $10,000 invested in the average actively managed fund 
five years ago: $17,490
 
✓ Value today of $10,000 invested in the average index fund five years ago: 
$18,923
 
✓ Extra money in the pocket of the index investor, per $10,000 invested, 
after five years: $1,433

35
 Chapter 3: Why Indexing Works — and Works So Darned Well
Longer-term index fund performance 
results: Very good!
Per Morningstar, here are the 15-year performance results:
 
✓ Overall average yearly return of all actively managed funds, past 15 
years: 7.76 percent
 
✓ Overall average yearly return of all index funds, past 15 years: 9.70 percent
 
✓ Percent by which the index funds have outshined the actively managed 
funds in the past 15 years: 25 percent
Studies, studies, and more studies
One study says that index funds beat actively 
managed funds 60 percent of the time. Another 
study says 70 percent of the time. And a third 
study says 95 percent of the time. Why the huge 
discrepancies? I found a pretty good answer in 
the academic Journal of Financial Planning, 
in the November 2007 article “Spotlighting 
Common Methodological Biases in Active-Vs.-
Passive Studies” by David M. Blanchett and 
Craig L. Israelsen.
Here are why the studies can and do differ, 
according to the two researchers:
 ✓ Survivorship bias. How do we account for 
funds that existed, say, 20 years ago, but 
have since folded? There are plenty of them 
out there. Do you pretend they never existed, 
or leave them out of the study altogether?
 ✓ Weightings. Do we give each active fund 
equal measure, or do the funds with 
more assets count more in determining the 
average?
 ✓ Share differences. Some mutual funds come 
in different share classes (retail, institutional, 
and so on) with different expense ratios and 
performance figures. Do we use one share 
class (which one?) or combine all of them?
 ✓ Index choices. Which indexes are we pick-
ing to match up against the actively man-
aged funds? As I explain throughout this 
book, indexes vary greatly, as do their per-
formance records.
 ✓ Time frame. Even a few days’ difference in 
when a study starts and stops can make for 
large differences in results.
But don’t sweat all this small stuff, conclude 
the authors. Regardless of methodology, most 
studies still come to the same conclusion: 
Indexing rocks. “[T]he research conducted for 
this paper suggests that the possibility of con-
sistently superior active management is the 
exception, not the rule, and that advisors [this 
is a journal written for financial advisors] should 
take a buyer-beware approach when selecting 
active management for client portfolios,” write 
the authors.

Part I: The (Mostly) Nonviolent Indexing Revolution 
 
✓ Value today of $10,000 invested in the average actively managed fund 15 
years ago: $30,068
 
✓ Value today of $10,000 invested in the average index fund 15 years ago: 
$40,010
 
✓ Extra money in the pocket of the index investor, per $10,000 invested, 
after 15 years: $9,942
 
Mind you, these are all pre-tax figures. Index funds are generally much gentler 
than actively managed funds in regard to taxes. So after taxes, the differences 
shown would tend to be much greater (depending on your tax bracket). Again, 
the laurels go to index funds. The darts go to actively managed funds.
Intrigued?
The reasons for the success of index investing — the heart, really, of why you 
want to be an index investor — are numerous and varied.
Indexing for Optimal Portfolio 
Leanness and Meanness
Any discussion of why indexing works must start with the low costs.
Conversely, any discussion of active investing must start with the high costs. 
Feeding veal cheeks and asparagus in merlot sauce to all those potential cus-
tomers doesn’t come cheap!
I begin now an in-depth discussion of the cost factors and other factors, such 
as transparency, tax efficiency, and cash drag, that make indexing so logical, 
so profitable, so sweet.
Keeping your costs to a minimum
Managers of index funds aren’t attempting to beat the market by picking 
cherries or market timing. There is no pretense (yes, pretense, for that’s 
largely what it is) that they know better than anyone else which way the 
market winds are blowing, or which company stocks will do better in that 
market. As such, they have less work to do than the managers of active 
mutual funds. They therefore can charge you a lot less — and they do.

37
 Chapter 3: Why Indexing Works — and Works So Darned Well
According to 2008 figures from Morningstar, the average actively run mutual 
fund now charges a yearly management fee of 1.29 percent, and that does not 
include any additional sales charges or loads, which many actively managed 
funds carry. The average index mutual fund charges a yearly management fee 
of 0.76 percent, and the average exchange-traded fund (nearly all of which 
are index funds) carries an expense ratio of 0.56. Many index funds impose 
yearly expense ratios much lower — in a good number of cases, less than 
0.10 percent.
 
What does that mean over the life of an investment? A lot. All things being 
equal, if you plunk $10,000 into a fund with gross (pre-expense) returns of 10 
percent a year and an expense ratio of 1.29 percent, and that same amount 
into a fund with a similar gross return that charges 0.20 percent, after 20 
years, you’ll have $53,136 in the more expensive fund versus $64,870 in the 
less expensive. In other words (or numbers), the less expensive fund, due 
partly to the miracle of compound interest, will give you, over two decades, a 
total greater return of $11,734 on your original investment of $10,000!
Is your actively run mutual fund — gulp! — 
paying for strippers?
In March 2008, the Securities and Exchange 
Commission received settlement charges from 
mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments and from 
Jefferies & Co., a New York–based brokerage 
firm. The SEC alleged that Fidelity managers 
had gotten kickbacks from Jefferies in the 
form of concert tickets, bottles of wine, travel 
deals, and even lavish parties with strippers. 
In exchange for these kickbacks, the Fidelity 
managers allegedly allowed Jefferies brokers 
to trade securities held in Fidelity funds — and 
Fidelity paid a rather generous fee for Jefferies 
to place those trades.
“This case demonstrates again the SEC’s com-
mitment to preventing conflicts of interest from 
compromising the integrity of the markets,” 
said David P. Bergers, an SEC official, in an SEC 
press release. “Investment advisers must insist 
that brokerage firms compete for mutual fund 
business based on their ability to deliver best 
execution, not based on personal consider-
ations like event tickets.”
In other words, if you owned a Fidelity mutual 
fund, you were, according to the SEC alle-
gations, indirectly paying for the manager’s 
receipt of all kinds of goodies. Every time Fidelity 
managers placed a trade, you were potentially 
scalped. Fidelity consented to the SEC order 
and paid the fines without admitting or denying 
the findings.
Mind you, index fund managers also on occa-
sion buy and sell securities — but very infre-
quently. It is doubtful that the manager of an 
index fund would receive many invitations to 
take a trip to Bermuda, attend the Super Bowl, 
or — if the manager were a single guy — be 
entertained by dancing naked women.

38
Part I: The (Mostly) Nonviolent Indexing Revolution 
But it isn’t only management fees that are kept to a minimum by the miracle 
of indexing. There are also trading costs incurred by actively run mutual 
funds. You never know how much those trading costs are — unlike the 
management fee, they appear nowhere in the prospectus — but they can be 
substantial. I’m talking about the spread, or the difference between the ask 
price and the bid price. And I’m talking about fees paid to place trades on 
any exchange. These are a sad part of doing business on Wall Street, and a 
mutual fund manager can’t avoid the spread or trading fees much more than 
you can. So that $11,734 difference could turn out to be even larger.
With all the extra fees and costs of active management, coming out ahead of 
the indexes is akin to winning a race while running in lead boots!
Making your financial life 
more predictable
If you have but one stock in your portfolio — even a purportedly blue chip, 
multibillion-dollar darling — then you are taking, in my mind, a huge, unnec-
essary risk. Remember the venerable Ford Motor Company, trading at nearly 
$40 a share in 1999? As I write this book, in early 2008, it’s trading at around 
$5.50 (a loss of 86 percent). Then, of course, there’s Enron, which went from 
almost $90 a share to $0 in less time than it takes to say “bankruptcy.”
Consider some other companies that were almighty blue chips when you 
were a kid whose stock is now worth doodly-squat or less: Bethlehem Steel 
(right around the corner from me), Dow Corning, Eastman Kodak, Sears, 
Union Carbide, and U.S. Steel. As I’m writing this chapter, a good number of 
large and powerful finance and home-construction companies have lost two-
thirds or more of their value with the decline in real estate prices and the 
subprime mortgage fiasco.
 
While index investing can be volatile (how volatile depends on the particular 
index you track), it has never been nearly as volatile as investing in individual 
stocks. In the past 50 years, the worst year ever for the S&P 500 — an index 
of America’s 500 most influential companies — was 1974, when it clocked a 
depressing but not devastating return of –26.5. The next year, 1975, it recap-
tured the entire loss. The relatively recent bear market of 2000, 2001, and 2002 
was the only three consecutive years the S&P has declined since the Great 
Depression. That was followed by three very cheery years.
Of course, any fund whatsoever, either a mutual fund or an exchange-traded 
fund, will tend to have lower volatility (both downside and upside) than an 
individual stock. But index funds generally boast the greatest diversification 
(typically dozens if not hundreds of individual securities) for the smoothest 
possible ride to riches.

39
 Chapter 3: Why Indexing Works — and Works So Darned Well
Allowing different — and distinct — 
baskets for your eggs
If you own two or more mutual funds or exchange-traded funds, you get more 
diversification than you do by owning just one fund . . . maybe. The problem 
with many mutual funds is that you aren’t always sure what you’re buying, 
and the fund may be subject to style drift. That means the manager may be 
big on large U.S. company stocks one year and something entirely different 
(say, mid cap stocks) the next year. That drift can result in unfortunate over-
lap between your various funds — funds that you thought, when you bought 
them, were separate and distinct.
When the Internet bubble burst in 2000, several funds in the high-flying 
mutual fund company Janus were simultaneously trounced. It turned out that 
despite having different names and descriptions, they were holding not only 
similar stocks but, in many cases, the very same stocks.
 
With index funds, it becomes much easier to buy tight and distinct “baskets” 
in which to store your financial “eggs.” Buy one index fund that focuses on, 
say, large growth stocks, and another that focuses on small value stocks, and 
you know you’re getting diversification — a mix of investments that includes 
some that zig while others zag — and not a lot of overlap.
There is perhaps no better way to diversify and protect your investments 
than with index funds.
Smacking down Uncle Sam’s cut
All index funds, and especially exchange-traded funds, tend to be very tax effi-
cient. Because they do little securities trading, there is rarely a capital gains 
tax to pay unless you personally happen to sell shares at a greater price than 
you purchased them. With actively run mutual funds, it’s a whole other story. 
Not only do securities trade within the funds, but they often trade like confetti 
in the wind. That leads to potential short-term capital gains, which are taxed at 
the same rate as normal income tax, usually much higher than long-term capi-
tals gains. (Long-term generally refers to securities held more than one year.)
Even worse, as a holder of shares of an actively run mutual fund, you may 
be subject to capital gains earned within the fund even if your shares have 
decreased in price and even if you personally have done no trading. A lot of 
mutual fund investors were stung badly at the onset of the bear market of 
2000–2002. Not only did their investments sink, but to add insult to injury, 
they had to pay capital gains tax on profits made by the fund before they 
even bought into it!

Part I: The (Mostly) Nonviolent Indexing Revolution 
Eliminating cash drag
One rather insidious cost to active management shows up neither on the fund 
prospectus nor on your tax forms. It is called cash drag. In order to buy and sell 
when he thinks the market is hot or cold, and in order to grab those shares of 
ABC Corporation at what he sees as the opportune moment, Mr. Active Fund 
Manager needs cash, and sometimes lots of it. That is why actively managed 
funds must have relatively large wads of cash sitting around.
According to the latest figures from Morningstar, the average index fund 
hordes 5.4 percent of its assets in cash. The average actively managed fund 
hordes 7.6 percent. In other words, if you have $100,000 invested in the aver-
age index fund, $5,400 will be in cash at most times. If you have that same 
amount invested in the average actively managed funds, you’ll have $7,600 
sitting idly in cash.
How much does that extra $2,200 — or 2.2 percent of your portfolio — drag 
down your long-term performance? Not to a huge degree, but enough to make 
some difference. And in some cases, an actively managed fund may well have 
much more than the average 7.6 percent of assets in cash. I’ve seen some 
cases where the cash reserve is as much as one-third of the fund assets. That 
can create serious cash drag, costing you plenty over time.
A caveat: When the market tanks, you want as much of your nest egg in cash 
as possible. For that reason, cash drag can be an asset, and actively managed 
funds often do better in times of market crisis. But I don’t see that as a plus, 
per se, for actively managed funds. Why pay some clown 2 percent a year to 
hold your cash?! If you need the kind of portfolio protection that cash pro-
vides, keep your cash in a money-market account or short-term CD and earn 
a little on it. Keep your long-term money in funds that keep your money gain-
fully invested — such as index funds.
Assuring greater transparency
Want to avoid unpleasant surprises (in addition to unexpected year-end 
taxes)? Then you want index funds. With index funds, you won’t find the 
notorious 12-B fees that enrich the industry and allow mutual fund compa-
nies to charge you, the shareholder, for their marketing and advertising. You 
won’t find fund managers looking for window dressing in December — those 
last-minute purchases made for the sole purpose of making the fund’s annual 
returns look better than they actually were. And you won’t be enticed to buy 
an index fund, as you may be enticed to buy an actively managed fund, by a 
salesman posing as a “financial planner” who stands to make a big, fat com-
mission off you.

41
 Chapter 3: Why Indexing Works — and Works So Darned Well
With index funds, you always know exactly what you’re getting, and you know 
what you’re paying for it. People in the finance world call that transparency, 
and it is a very attractive benefit of indexing.
Theoretical and Real-World Problems 
with Trying to Beat the Market
Okay, okay, perhaps you’re saying to yourself now, actively managed funds 
are more expensive than index funds, and they result in higher taxes and all 
that. But still, there certainly are some managers out there who are so darned 
smart that whatever they charge is worth it — whatever shortcomings active 
management has, they are worth it.
Well, maybe . . .
Granted, some active fund managers have rather impressive track records at 
beating the markets. There are, alas, very few of them. And how do you find 
these rock stars of finance? Just as many studies that show the superiority of 
index investing show that active managers with impressive past performance 
often show lackluster performance in latter years.
(True, index funds may also do very well in one year and terrible the next, 
but they don’t have high-priced managers who are allegedly there to see that 
kind of thing doesn’t happen.)
Heck, as I’m writing this chapter, three months into 2008 — a terrible time for 
most markets — I thought I would call mutual fund analyst Morningstar just 
to see how a few of last year’s top-performing mutual funds were doing this 
year. Ready for some depressing numbers? See Table 3-1.

Part I: The (Mostly) Nonviolent Indexing Revolution 
There are a number of reasons why active management, although it appears 
great in theory (do your homework, and you’ll find great buys in the market!), 
usually flops in reality. In fact, the theory behind active management — that 
buying securities is like buying a used car; kick the tires and you’ll get those 
great buys — just doesn’t make much sense. Securities are not used cars. The 
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ bear very little resem-
blance to Bob’s Formerly Owned Vehicles.
In the one case (honk honk), you may be able to walk onto the used car lot, 
check out all 500 cars, and, if you really know cars, buy the one that has been 
underpriced by the market. You drive home happy. The car lasts you for 
years. All is good. In the other case, you find a stock that you think is under-
priced. You buy it. But in order for you to be happy, the price of the stock 
has to rise . . . more than the market at large. That’s when you find out that 
the stock you thought was underpriced was perhaps right-priced — or over-
priced.
As just about anyone who has tried active management for long enough 
(oh, yes, yes, that includes me) can attest, if you kick the tires repeatedly, 
all you’re likely to get are sore feet. If you try to get the NYSE or NASDAQ to 
throw in free mats, you’re only going to assure yourself that you’ll be driving 
home in a lemon.
The average investor is very 
smart and educated
Here, in a nutshell, is why active management is so often a dud, and invest-
ing is nothing like buying a used car: All the tires have already been kicked. 
Numerous times. Securities are not used cars, in that their purchase and sale 
is ongoing, and your quest to get a better deal than everyone else involves 
some very, very smart and talented everyone elses.
A strange paradox
Index investing works because the financial 
markets are quite efficient. That means that 
there are many buyers and sellers, and informa-
tion flows rather freely, so getting a better deal 
on a stock than the next guy is next to impos-
sible. Oddly enough, if everyone indexed, the 
market would no longer be efficient, and index-
ing would no longer work. We indexers NEED 
active investors who are constantly crunching 
numbers to make certain that stocks buy and 
sell at rational prices.

43
 Chapter 3: Why Indexing Works — and Works So Darned Well
Let me explain.
Suppose you find a fund manager with umpteen degrees, a mind for math, 
and a deep knowledge of the markets. That manager crunches numbers till 
the cows come home (“kicking tires”), and he comes up with what he sees as 
a good stock to buy for your portfolio. He buys that stock. Instead of going 
up, the stock goes down, as often happens with active management. Can you 
imagine what possibly went wrong?
Consider where your alleged knight-in-Brooks-Brothers bought the particular 
“can’t lose” stock from. He went to the NASDAQ or to the New York Stock 
Exchange, and he placed an order. And someone somewhere, through the 
market, sold him that stock. Why did the seller sell? Probably because he 
thought the stock was going down, or at least wasn’t going to go up as much 
as other stocks. And — here’s the catch — that seller is, in all likelihood, 
every bit as educated and smart as your guy.
In fact, the vast majority of stocks are bought and sold by very highly paid 
and educated professional fund managers, endowment managers, insurance 
company and pension managers, and the like. These are, by and large, people 
who know their stuff. These are no financial fools.
But whenever one of these Brooks Brothers knights is buying, another is 
selling. When one is selling, another is buying. What I’m describing is known 
in financial circles as an efficient market. There’s a lot of knowledge out 
there, shared more or less equally among potential buyers and sellers. It is 
extremely hard to get a really good deal.
If you are inclined to pick stocks on your own, I encourage you to ask your-
self this one question before sinking part of your life savings into any indi-
vidual security: If I buy that stock, someone will be selling it. Why would that 
someone (very likely a professional trader) be selling — and what makes me 
think that I’m smarter than he is? Unless you have a very good answer to that 
question, you should think twice before trying to beat the market.
Market rigging is rampant
Of course, if the markets were all efficient and the playing field were completely 
level, you’d have a 50/50 chance of beating the market by picking your own 
stocks. But I don’t believe the playing field is entirely level. Neither you nor 
the typical professional buyer on Wall Street has a particular advantage — 
but others do. True “insider” trading, which is illegal, is probably not all that 
common. But there is a boatload of quasi-insider trading going on out there 
that makes it very difficult for the little guy, or even the not-so-little guy, to 
come out ahead.

44
Part I: The (Mostly) Nonviolent Indexing Revolution 
Consider, for example, two studies:
 
✓ Big executives may donate gifts of company stock to their own family 
foundations — and get tax deductions for doing so. Research by David 
Yermack, a finance professor at New York University, found that such 
donations have an astonishing way of being made just before sharp 
drops in the company’s stock price. In fact, 151 such gifts of more than 
$1 million were made between mid-2003 and the end of 2005, and stock 
prices fell relative to the market in about 60 percent of the cases.
 
✓ U.S. senators seem to do as well at market timing as corporate execu-
tives. Alan Ziobrowski, a professor at Georgia State University, examined 
the personal stock portfolios of the top U.S. politicians and found that 
they tended to outperform the market by 12 percent a year. Most stocks 
bought by senators — seemingly average stocks before they were pur-
chased — somehow outperformed the market by nearly 29 percent the 
calendar year after being purchased by the senators. The eight-year 
study, released in 2004, also found that the high-flying stocks somehow 
returned to normal after leaving the senators’ portfolios.
Moral of story: Buy index funds, and you won’t need to worry about certain 
securities being bought and sold by those in the know, whether captains of 
industry or Washington elite. One stock may be inflated by their shenanigans; 
another stock may be deflated. You won’t care, because you’ll own them 
both — and lots of others, to boot.
Imitation is the greatest form of flattery
Suppose you buy into an actively managed 
mutual fund, pay a boatload of cash for the 
honor of doing so, and then find out that the 
managers are really indexing the vast majority 
of your money. In other words, they are run-
ning a closet index fund, putting your dollars 
exactly where they would be if you had put 
them in a real index fund, but charging you two, 
three, or four times as much. It happens all the 
time, according to Yale University researchers 
Martijn Cremers and Antti Petajisto. In fact, a 
study they did in 2007 came to the startling con-
clusion that nearly 30 percent of all “actively 
managed” mutual funds hug the indexes so 
closely that you may as well be investing in a 
real index fund.
Why do so many active fund managers hug the 
indexes? Because indexing works! Why don’t 
they just call their funds index funds? Because 
they make more money off you by pretending to 
be active managers!
How do you avoid buying into a closet index 
fund? If you know what to look for, avoiding 
this common rip-off isn’t all that hard to do. I 
describe how in Chapter 13.

n 1951, Eric Hoffer, a manual laborer from San Francisco with no formal 
education, wrote a book that was to become a highly acclaimed classic, 
both in academia and elsewhere. The book was entitled The True Believer. It 
attempted to explain why large groups of people, even seemingly very smart 
people, can sometimes do really dumb things.
I’m convinced that if Hoffer were alive today and writing a new edition, there 
would be at least one chapter devoted to active investing and active investors.
If you know Hoffer, you know that he spends a lot of time decrying the ridicu-
lous thinking (alleged thinking) of fascists. Mind you, I am not comparing fol-
lowers of active investing to people who wear knee-high boots and goose-step 
in the streets! Active investors — those who choose active mutual funds or try 
to actively trade stocks on their own — aren’t nearly that crazy, or dangerous. 
But they can similarly be subject to delusional thinking and gross illogic. And 
they can also be highly susceptible to propaganda and manipulation.

Part I: The (Mostly) Nonviolent Indexing Revolution 
I hope I’m not sounding preachy or overzealous (or plum out of my mind), 
but given the enormous amount of evidence in favor of index investing (see 
Chapter 3), I find it hard to come to any other conclusion but that active 
investors — who outnumber index investors by roughly 5:1 — are often dizzy 
and confused, or manipulated beyond their senses.
Buy low! Sell high! Beat the market! Sieg heil! “Booyah,” as Mad Money’s Jim 
Cramer likes to shout into the camera, as he rolls up his sleeves and touts the 
stock of the hour.
In this chapter, I explain why and how and by whom many followers of active 
investing are easily manipulated, and how that manipulation costs them a ton 
of money.
Booyah!
 
Caveat: Not ALL active investing is fruity or manipulative or a rip-off — just 
most of it.
Booyah!
In fact, in Chapter 13, I talk about how active and passive investing can be 
fruitfully combined. Active investing must be done with extreme caution 
because it is most often a losing proposition. In terms of overall risk versus 
return over the long run, it can’t hold a candle to index investing.
Booyah!
Worshipping Wall Street
Man is the only creature that strives to surpass himself, and yearns for the 
impossible.
—Eric Hoffer
With roughly $7.7 trillion invested in actively managed mutual funds — with 
the average fund charging clients 1.29 percent a year — that gig alone is 
earning Wall Street more than the GDP of many smaller nations. Add to that 
the enormous amount of money held at places the likes of Smith Barney and 
Merrill Lynch and a gadzillion smaller investment advisory firms where com-
missioned stock brokers call themselves financial planners. At places like 
these, money is not made by making money for clients; it’s made by skimming 
money from clients. The more they make, the more you lose.
In total, we find a huge industry — both mutual funds and brokerage houses 
that actively trade securities — that is built in good measure on the lay pub-
lic’s ignorance. If everyone knew and truly understood the benefits of index

investing, Wall Street would very likely morph into something completely 
different, and the money shows on television would go the way of Mr. Ed and 
The Munsters.
As Table 4-1 shows, the differences between actively managed funds and 
index funds are not hard to see.

Warren Buffett, Russell Wild
With this kind of information readily available, brokerage houses and mutual 
fund companies must work to maintain the public’s ignorance and to ensure 
the continuation of misconceptions and doubt. Toward that end, they have 
developed some very slick tricks over the years.
Hiding the fees on financial statements
I see it time and time again . . . A new client comes to me with a “feeling’” that 
his or her portfolio hasn’t been doing especially well. I ask to see the broker’s 
portfolio reports. Here’s what I see:
 
✓ A stack of paper, including a detailed list of holdings with the historical 
returns and historical standard deviations of each holding.
 
✓ Graphs and charts of all shapes and colors showing portfolio returns 
versus the returns of various indexes over the years.
 
✓ Page after page of cost bases and time-weighted total returns for your 
portfolio (had your portfolio, such as it is today, been in place five years 
ago) versus the S&P 500.

48
Part I: The (Mostly) Nonviolent Indexing Revolution 
In other words, what they give you is a lot of useless and practically meaning-
less crap.
I’m not exaggerating.
In the small print of an actual Smith Barney quarterly review report that is 
sitting on my lap as I type, it says the following:
All rates of return on this page are presented before the deduction of 
management fees.
 
Huh? In other words, you have no idea what your real rate of return is after 
paying Smith Barney’s fees. And how much are those fees? Nowhere in the 
entire report can you find them, except perhaps on a line that mysteriously 
tabulates “Contributions/Withdrawals/Fees” as a single item. This purposeful 
subterfuge has been going on for years and years, and how they get away with 
it, I have no idea. It amazes and perplexes me that neither the Securities and 
Exchange Commission nor the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority clamps 
down on this nonsense.
Furthermore, when you call the Smith Barney broker (as I have asked a number 
of clients to do, and as I’ve sometimes done myself) to ask for your fees, you 
get a mouthful of tuna fish and a few I’ll-have-to-get-back-to-you-on-thats. Good 
luck getting a straightforward answer! I’m sure it is a small fortune.
As I show in Chapter 3, in the end, active trading of stocks or bonds typically 
earns you less than you would earn owning cheap index funds. But you’ll 
never know that reading the full-service broker reports.
Pumping short-term performers
Many active investors allow so-called full-service (read: ridiculously high 
commissioned) stock brokers to churn them. Churn means that securities 
are bought and sold, and then bought and sold again, with the only apparent 
benefits going to the churner (and perhaps to Uncle Sam) — very rarely to 
the churnee.
Many other investors rely on overpriced, underperforming actively run 
mutual funds to lose money for them, relative to the markets, year after year.
Mutual fund companies are very adept at grabbing investors’ money based on 
all sorts of unfounded promises relayed to the public through repeated adver-
tisements in glossy magazines, newspaper spreads, and Web site home pages.

49
 Chapter 4: Why Everyone Isn’t Indexing 
 
In the past few years, the Securities and Exchange Commission has taken 
some action — although far from enough — to reduce deceptive advertising 
in this arena. But a favorite trick of mutual fund companies that persists is the 
comparison of their funds’ performance to completely irrelevant benchmarks. 
The S&P 500 Index hasn’t done very well in the past ten years. For that reason, 
many active mutual fund companies just love to compare their funds’ ten-year 
performance to the S&P 500 . . . even if their funds invest very little in big U.S. 
companies, the likes of the 500. When compared to more appropriate bench-
marks, such as any number of, say, international stock indexes, those same 
actively managed funds may start to look rather miserable.
Another deceptive practice — pumping short-term performers — continues 
after years of practice and perfection to give the public a totally false perception 
that some stock pickers really know their stuff and can handily beat indexing.
Here’s how it’s often done: XYZ mutual fund company has 20 mutual funds. 
One invests in, say, large U.S. stocks. Another invests in European stocks. 
A third invests in the stocks of emerging-market (poor) countries. A fourth 
invests in oil and gold. Now say, for whatever reasons, the winds of the econ-
omy over the past year have blown hard in the face of developed-world stock 
markets, but emerging-market nations’ stock markets and commodities (they 
often go hand-in-hand) have flown. Chances are good that this company’s 
funds in those areas have done very well. Why? Because up to 90 percent of 
funds’ overall return will be due to the kind of investments it makes, rather 
than the specific security selection.
 
Let me repeat that: Up to 90 percent of funds’ overall return will be due to the 
kind of investments it makes, rather than the specific security selection. We know 
this through years of study. If you look at the best-performing mutual funds of 
any given year, they will almost always be funds that invest in the same asset 
class. An asset class is a kind of investment — such as large growth stocks or 
commodities — that tends to exhibit its own behavior, somewhat independent 
of other kinds of investments.
The XYZ mutual fund company, in its advertisement, doesn’t have to reveal 
that its funds clocked such fabulous returns simply because it was their turn 
to clock fabulous returns, given the kind of fund they are. Instead, the com-
pany takes out full-page advertisements boasting of the performance of, say, 
its emerging-market and commodity mutual funds, with the strong implica-
tion being that its active managers are brilliant.
Nowhere in the advertisement, or only in very small print, does it bother to 
mention that you would have done even better in an index fund that invests — 
and invests much more cheaply — in that very same kind of investment. (Yes, 
there are many such index funds.) And you are left with the false impression 
that XYZ’s almighty stock pickers had something to do with the fund’s superla-
tive performance. It simply isn’t so.

Tuning In (Tuning Out) the 
Circus on Television
Far more crucial than what we know or don’t know is what we do not want 
to know.
—Eric Hoffer
I mention Jim (Mad Money) Cramer at the onset of this chapter. With his 
bulging eyes and protruding veins and screaming and yelling and sounds of 
toilets flushing, the guy would be great entertainment, and a wonderful laugh, 
if only some investors didn’t take him seriously. I’m sorry, Jim, but these are 
real people investing real money and suffering real consequences when they 
take your bum tips. I love a good laugh, and I think I have a good sense of 
humor, but I simply don’t find you funny.
Jim Cramer is only the tip of the iceberg, of course. The media’s coverage of 
the markets and exploitation of the public are, by and large, shameful. I know 
of what I speak here. I was a journalist long before I became a financial plan-
ner. There is perhaps no area of the news where the media does a poorer job 
than in the area of investing.
Making market calls
Jim Cramer picks stocks. Many magazine articles pick stocks or funds. You’re 
familiar with the headlines: “10 Hot Stocks for the New Year!” “Best Funds to 
Buy NOW!” “Earn 30% in the Next Year!”
Most of us know, deep down, that plunking down $4.95 for a magazine is not 
likely to make us rich. But such headlines titillate and taunt us into buying 
magazines, and then tempt us to follow the get-rich-quick advice.
If you think about it, how could a stock tip relayed to potentially millions of 
readers or viewers possibly have any value? It doesn’t. Jim Cramer’s track 
record has been pretty well studied, and it is pretty miserable. (I won’t bore 
you with details. You can do an Internet search and find plenty of indepen-
dent analyses.)
What’s in it for the magazines, the newspaper columns, and Jim Cramer? Why 
not give reasonable investment advice, such as advising people to buy index 
funds and to buy and hold their investments rather than trying to quickly 
trade their way to richness? Why the big tease? Why the toilets flushing and 
the screaming and yelling?

51
 Chapter 4: Why Everyone Isn’t Indexing 
The answer, in short, is that indexing doesn’t hold the same entertainment 
value. Teasing people that they can make big money fast sells publications 
and air time. Telling people to buy index funds and buy and hold can be 
boring after a while.
Headlining what’s hot
 
If you look inside the pages of many investment publications, such as Money, 
Smart Money, and Kiplinger’s, you’ll find lots of good advice — including the 
advice to start index investing and stop trying to time the markets and pick 
cherries. It’s usually the cover pieces — designed to sell magazines off the 
news racks — that truly stink. My advice: If you want to read about money in a 
magazine, just ignore the cover story!
And keep in mind when you read a story such as one that recently appeared 
in U.S. News & World Report entitled “How to Make Money The Buffett Way” 
that investors such as Warren Buffett, while they may beat the market, also 
have way more control over the market than you do. When he buys stock in a 
company, Buffett often sends in management consultants to change the way 
a company does business. Can you do that?
Not even Warren Buffett can always do that. The billionaire from Omaha has 
numerous times recommended index investing for most investors.
Mad predictions
Every time you turn on the TV, there’s some guy 
shouting at you, telling you which stock to buy 
this week to beat the market. These antics help 
explain why many investors feel they should 
pick stocks instead of buying index funds. After 
all, why should they miss out on all the huge 
profits?
As I was writing this chapter, news broke 
that the brokerage firm Bear Stearns is facing 
bankruptcy. ”Anything to worry about?” asked 
a viewer named Peter of Mad Money’s Jim 
Cramer on March 11, 2008.
“NO! NO! NO! Don’t move your money from 
Bear!!!” screamed the host of the show, waving 
his arms, eyes digging into the camera. “If 
anything, it’s more likely to be taken over!” he 
added. “That’s just being silly! Don’t be silly!”
(I suggest watching the clip on YouTube. Search 
“Jim Cramer Bear Stearns,” and you’ll find it.)
Six days later, Bear Stearns shares fell by 90 
percent. I hope that Peter didn’t take Cramer’s 
advice. If he did, he is now feeling silly indeed.

52
Part I: The (Mostly) Nonviolent Indexing Revolution 
Also keep in mind that for every Warren Buffett, there are many, many more 
stock pickers who tried and failed. I’m one! And I know plenty of others. It is very, 
very difficult to pick winning stocks with any kind of regularity. With the costs 
involved, and taxes, you have to pick winning stocks rather consistently — and 
sell them at just the right time — to truly beat the markets. Not many people can 
do that — not many at all.
Patting themselves on the back
One of the reasons that you may find yourself lulled into reading and watch-
ing get-rich-quick investment stories is that the producers often praise them-
selves for making readers or viewers money, giving the firm impression that 
they’ve done so and can do it again. Horsedung.
 
Keep in mind that the same regulations that apply to, say, stock fund prospec-
tuses do not apply to the media. An investment-picking columnist or televi-
sion trading evangelist can (and often does) say just about anything he wants 
about his alleged past prowess at cherry picking.
But here’s what columnists and pundits and investment newsletters (mustn’t 
forget those!) often fail to tell you when patting themselves on the back:
 
✓ You would have made money regardless . . . and probably more. Jim 
Cramer ballyhooed his stock-picking performance over a recent one-
year period, exclaiming that his mad-money method had earned 16.2 
percent. Great. But when compared to index funds invested in the same 
kinds of stocks (mostly mid cap with a few foreign stocks), you would 
have seen a return of 21.8 percent. Throw in the (uncalculated) costs of 
actually making Cramer’s trades and paying the short-term taxes, and 
your simple index funds’ performance would have smashed Cramer’s.
 
✓ Costs are whitewashed. The cost of trading (commissions, spreads, 
and so on) can be so high that it makes frequent stock trading almost a 
guaranteed recipe for failure. Value Line Investment Survey newsletter, 
for example, makes extraordinary claims for its past prowess at earning 
subscribers high returns.
 
 From the Value Line Web site, we read the following:
 
 A stock portfolio of #1 Ranked stocks for Timeliness from The 
Value Line Investment Survey, beginning in 1965 and updated at 
the beginning of each year, would have shown a gain of 24,470% 
through the month end of December 2007.
 
 That compares with a gain of 1,355% in the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average over the same period. Value Line #1 Ranked stocks out-
performed the Dow by more than 18 TO 1.
 
 This gain would have beaten the S&P 500 by nearly 15 to 1 for the 
same time span.

53
 Chapter 4: Why Everyone Isn’t Indexing 
 
 Ready to plunk down your $600 a year and start making money fast? 
Hold on!
 
 Let’s check the real-world returns of the Value Line mutual fund (VLIFX), 
which, according to its prospectus, is run by the very same people and 
with the very same wisdom that guides the newsletter whose success 
is trumpeted above. How well has VLIFX done in past years? In other 
words, how well has the Value Line method worked in real life?
 
 According to Morningstar Principia, pretty darned poorly. The fund’s 
10-year annual return is now 10.75 percent, compared to 12.40 percent for 
the S&P 500. Going back 15 years, the fund returned an average annual 6.9 
percent, compared to the S&P 500’s 9.98 percent annual return. Not only 
did the fund fail to beat the major index, but the fund was waaaaay more 
volatile, and you would have incurred waaaay more tax.
 
✓ Ooops! Past goofs are simply forgotten. Some people have no shame. 
Paul R. La Monica, a CNNMoney.com editor and writer with a syndi-
cated column, makes regular stock picks that appear in my daily paper. 
Just for fun, I often hang onto his stock tips and see how they’ve done 
months after they’ve made the press. The man’s talent at losing money 
is almost not to be believed. If he invested in his own stock picks (I imag-
ine he’s way too smart to do that), he would have achieved bankruptcy 
a long time ago.
 
 And La Monica isn’t alone — consider the Beardstown Ladies, a group 
of older women from Beardstown, Illinois, who got together to form an 
investment club in the mid 1980s and claimed to beat the market by 
leaps and bounds. Their first book on stock-picking, The Beardstown 
Ladies’ Common-Sense Investment Guide, was a rave best seller. But 
then (at the prodding of my fellow Dummies finance author Eric Tyson), 
independent auditors started to look at the ladies’ real-world returns. 
They found that the Beardstown Business and Professional Women’s 
Investment Club would have seen far, far better returns investing in 
index funds rather than trying to pick stocks. Even after these indepen-
dent analysts showed that the ladies’ stock picks earned far less than 
the indexes, that didn’t stop the ladies and their publisher from putting 
out four additional books on picking stocks.
 
 My fave is James Glassman, who wrote a book called Dow 36,000, predict-
ing in 1999 that the greatest bull run in market history — the 1990s — had 
only just begun. Just as the book came out, the market crashed. Glassman 
just continued to write investment advice columns and hardly made men-
tion of his phenomenal goof, except to occasionally say that his timing 
may have been a little off.
 
 We’re still waiting for Dow 36,000. As I write this, the Dow is trading at 
about 11,000.
 
If people like Glassman and La Monica and the Ladies of Beardstown weren’t 
offering pipe dreams and pretending that they come true, I’m certain that 
more people would be indexing — and earning money rather than losing it.

Delving Deep into the Human Psyche
We lie loudest when we lie to ourselves.
—Eric Hoffer
A few years ago, I attended a large workshop in which participants were 
asked to rate themselves as drivers. The rating options were above average, 
average, and below average. On little slips of paper, we all voted on our own 
street navigation skills. If I recall correctly, 70 percent of the people consid-
ered themselves “above average.” Only 5 percent considered themselves 
“below average.” Of course, unless this was an extraordinary group of people 
5 out of 10 experts agree . . .
One of the prime reasons the public at large 
doesn’t believe in indexing is because there 
are so many experts out there claiming to 
know which way shares of Microsoft, General 
Electric, Radio Shack, and every other stock are 
going. It’s hard not to believe that they can actu-
ally see the future! Pick up the business section 
of your paper, read any financial magazine, or 
log onto any investment Web site, and you’ll 
find story after story in which John Executive, 
a vice president with SuchandSuch Wall Street 
Brokerage Firm, is firing off his predictions on 
the future performance of a particular security 
or market sector. HA!
Guess what? At any point in time exactly 
half the experts on Wall Street will say that 
Microsoft (or any other stock) is going up rela-
tive to the market, and exactly half will say it’s 
going down! When the reporter who wrote that 
story looked for sources, he could have just as 
easily found a source to support the notion that 
Microsoft was going up as he could have found 
a source to support the notion that Microsoft 
was going down. It’s all a game!
Here’s how I know that at any point in time the 
ratio is 50/50: It has to be.
The big people on Wall Street who get quoted in 
newspapers are the market movers and shak-
ers themselves. The vast majority of stocks 
are bought and sold by institutional buyers: 
mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, insur-
ance companies, and endowment funds. Very 
few are bought by Joe Schmoes. If more than 
half of the institutional buyers thought the price 
of a stock was headed north, the price would, 
in fact, go up as a reflection of that optimism. 
The price would go up to a point where fewer 
experts would deem the stock to still be a buy. 
Conversely, if more than half the movers and 
shakers thought the stock was going down, 
they would stop buying, and the price of the 
stock would drop until you got to a point where 
fewer experts would deem the stock a loser.
Again: At any point in time, the market will be 
50/50 as to whether a particular security is going 
up or down. So when you see that such-and-
such an expert predicted that a stock would go 
up, the reporter who quoted that expert could 
just as easily have found some expert to say the 
opposite. Moral of story: Buy the index. Tune 
out the prognosticators. They don’t know what 
they’re talking about.

55
 Chapter 4: Why Everyone Isn’t Indexing 
(it wasn’t), something had to be amiss! It was. And should you ask a similarly 
large group of investors about their own stock-picking stills, I’m certain you’d 
find that way more than an average number would consider themselves 
above average.
Returning to our question du jour: Why isn’t everyone indexing? It is largely 
because of overconfidence in our own abilities.
 
Here lies perhaps the biggest reason that everyone doesn’t index: It isn’t the 
way we are manipulated and fooled by Wall Street or the media; rather, it is 
the way we manipulate and fool ourselves.
Picking darlings, fixating on numbers
You hear a tip. You buy a stock. The stock goes up. The stock goes down. 
The stock goes back up. In order to do better than the index investor, you 
have to buy low and sell high; the timing needs to be right on both ends. To 
truly do better than the index investor, you need to not only beat the indexes 
in terms of performance, but you need to do it with comparable risk. And you 
need to cover all your costs, including the time you spend researching stocks 
and the money you pay for stock-picking advice. And you need to pull out 
your money, pay Uncle Sam, and still wind up ahead.
As you can see, active investing presents quite a few hurdles. That’s why 
very few people can do it.
These hurdles are only part of what makes it so very difficult to pick stocks. 
The other part is the mental games that you (and every other wannabe day-
trader) wind up playing. You buy the stock at $5. It goes to $10. Perhaps 
the stock is bound to go to $20, but goshdarnit, you bought at $5. Who can 
resist taking such a quick profit? So you do. You lose out on any further gain. 
Conversely, you buy the stock at $5, and it goes to $2. You don’t sell — even 
though you have bad vibes about the company — because that would mean 
locking in your loss. You don’t sell, and you continue to lose money.
 
Prices, it has been said, have no memory. The price you paid and the price 
you plan to sell at are both irrelevant in the real world of investing. But try 
making them irrelevant in your decision making!
Stock picking also lends itself to fixating on meaningless numbers and, often, 
falling in love with certain securities . . . for whatever reason we fall in love 
with anything. You may like the name, the logo, or the city in which the cor-
poration is headquartered. There are so many ways in which emotions can 
sway clear thinking.

Part I: The (Mostly) Nonviolent Indexing Revolution 
Stock traders are subject to all the same mind games that gamblers in Vegas 
are subject to, such as the classic gambler’s fallacy that leads us to believe in 
“inevitable” sequences: If the market goes down three days in a row, then it 
must go up the fourth, and such nonsense. Markets are largely random, and 
failure to accept that randomness leads people to not accept indexing as a 
powerful investment strategy — despite tons of evidence that it is.
 
If you believe that markets aren’t random, I invite you to do a simple little experi-
ment: Search the archives of The Wall Street Journal. Pick a date in history — any 
date. Read the stories about any particular company of which you know rela-
tively little. Try to predict, based on those stories, whether the company stock 
went up or down in the days and weeks that followed.
Alternatively, go onto a Web site such as Yahoo! Finance (www.finance.
yahoo.com) and pull up a chart showing the ups and downs of any stock or 
market sector over the past three months, six months, or year. Make sure 
this is a stock or market sector you are unfamiliar with. Take a piece of paper 
and cover the right side of your screen. Now, using only the left side of the 
screen as your guide, try to predict what’s on the right side.
What you’re doing in the first exercise, people in the investment world call 
fundamental analysis. That means looking at a company’s business to try to 
predict how well its stock will do. In the second exercise, I’m asking you to do 
technical analysis. That means using charts of stock movements to try to pre-
dict how well a stock will do. Neither is as easy as it looks, as these exercises 
will reveal.
Lots of stock pickers, both amateur and professional, think they can use fun-
damental and technical analysis to beat the markets. I’m sure that some can, 
but very, very few! Before you convince yourself that you are one, try my two 
exercises. I think you’ll find them quite humbling!
Keeping track of your own performance
I can’t tell you how often new clients come to me with their active portfolios 
and say, “I haven’t done too poorly, really . . . .” But then we start to crunch 
the numbers and discover how much better they would have done investing 
in indexes over the years.
It’s hard to measure portfolio performance accurately. You need to take 
account of all your deposits, withdrawals, trading and incidental costs, taxes 
(most often paid with money from outside the portfolio), and so on. If you 
think you’re an above average investor (as most investors do), it’s very easy to 
prove your point with a subtle, perhaps subconscious doctoring of the books.

57
 Chapter 4: Why Everyone Isn’t Indexing 
 
If you had simply invested $1 in the S&P 500 in 1926 and allowed it to sit and 
grow, that $1 would now be $3,100. And as I point out in later chapters, if you 
are going to invest in one index, the S&P 500 probably isn’t the best index to 
invest in. Had you invested, for example, $1 in a U.S. small cap value index in 
1926 (such a beast was only theoretical in 1926, but there are certainly many 
ways to tap into such an index today), your $1 would now be worth $51,000.
Granted, most people don’t have eight decades to invest their money and 
allow it to grow untouched. Still, I throw out these numbers so you can see 
that index investing certainly allows for ample creation of wealth.
The long-term track record is one good reason that index investing is well 
worth considering. And index investing’s fabulous track record also, despite 
all the reasons I discuss in this chapter, makes it odd that only a minority of 
investors are actually doing it. You, of course, will be in that minority. That 
means you’ll be one of the few investors who thinks he or she is above aver-
age who really, truly is above average!

haven’t been chopped off, but lots of fees were. The aristocracy wasn’t 
driven from the palace, but the small investor, for the first time in history, 
found himself no longer at a great disadvantage vis-à-vis (that’s a French 
expression) the large and powerful investor.
ETF stands for exchange-traded fund, and it is foremost and firstly an index 
fund. ETFs have all the advantages of index mutual funds — including low 
costs, tax efficiency, and transparency (you know what you’re buying) — 
with a few additional perks throw in, such as the ability to buy and sell them 
in a flash, just like an individual stock.
If you’re interested in finding out much more about ETFs, you may want to 
read Exchange-Traded Funds For Dummies (Wiley) by Russell Wild. (Hey, 
that’s me!) If you are interested mostly in a snapshot of how ETFs fit into 
the larger world of index investing, and how they are almost daily making 
that world even larger, then you’re exactly where you need to be. Vive la 
Révolution!

Part I: The (Mostly) Nonviolent Indexing Revolution 
Expanding the Indexing Universe
Beginning in the mid-1970s, and for 20 years to follow, if you wanted to be an 
index investor, the only practical way to do so (unless you were very, very rich 
and could build your own index portfolio) was through index mutual funds. 
You can still, of course, go that route, and there is nothing wrong with it.
In the mid-1990s, however, ETFs were born, and they have since exploded 
in popularity. As a result, you now have more than one viable route . . . you 
have two.
Introducing the new kid on the block
 
The difference between an ETF (the new kid on the block) and an index mutual 
fund (the old timer) is not as enormous as many investors seem to think. The 
words exchange-traded fund are frighteningly technical sounding, while the 
words mutual fund sound so soothing and friendly. In reality, one is no more 
complicated, technical, or unfriendly than the other. They both represent bas-
kets of securities or goods — stocks, bonds, or commodities — that you can 
buy or sell in one fell swoop.
If you’re comparing a mutual fund and an ETF that invest in the very same 
kind of investment — say, for example, large cap U.S. value stocks — there 
may be only marginal differences between the two. In most cases, a large cap 
U.S. value ETF and a large cap U.S. value index mutual fund that track the 
same index will have very similar costs, return potential, and risk. The differ-
ences between two such similar funds are discussed in Chapter 6.
In many cases, however, the ETF and the index mutual fund will not invest in 
the same kind of investment or track the same index. ETFs, you see, just like 
the Starship Enterprise, have clearly gone where no index mutual fund has 
gone before.
Tracking indexes that you 
never knew existed
The very first ETF introduced in the United States — just like the very first 
index mutual fund introduced about 20 years prior — tracked the venerable 
S&P 500, an index of stocks of the nation’s 500 largest companies. That auspi-
cious introduction came on January 29, 1993. That initial ETF was called the 

61
 Chapter 5: A New Era Begins: ETFs and Alternative Indexes
S&P Depositary Receipts Trust Series 1, also known as the SPDR (or spider) 
500. Issued by a company called State Street Global Advisors (SSgA), it traded 
then, and still trades, under the ticker SPY.
The next ETF to see the light tracked the even older Dow Jones Industrial 
Average, an index of the nation’s most powerful and influential companies 
as handpicked by a gang of editors at The Wall Street Journal. Also issued by 
SSgA, it trades under the ticker DIA.
Then came a slew of ETFs that invested in industry sectors, such as technology
stocks, healthcare stocks, or stocks of petroleum companies. And, at the same
 time, came ETFs that invested in different regions of the world, such as Europe, 
the Far East, or the emerging markets, as well as individual countries — 
Germany, Switzerland, or Canada, for example.
Lately, in an effort to capture more and more narrow slivers of the market 
(and capture more consumer dollars), ETF providers have given us a huge 
array of funds that track such industry niches as companies that manufac-
ture medical devices, broker/dealers, and home construction firms. Some of 
these more narrow indexes may have existed for years, but there were no 
investment products that tracked them.
Some of the newer ETFs — actually most of the newer ETFs, for better or 
worse — are now tracking indexes that were created specifically just so that 
an ETF could track them. Talk about the tail wagging the dog! Woof.
Tracking indexes that never existed before
Where ETFs have really changed forever the nature of index investing has 
been in the creation of indexes that offer the promise — if not the reality — 
of better investment tools.
These newfangled indexes sometimes reflect the markets like funhouse mir-
rors reflect your body. They exaggerate here and diminish there, giving us, 
for example, a version of the S&P 500 where the companies that pay high 
dividends appear as big as African elephants, and the companies that pay no 
dividends are portrayed as field mice.
Such distortions, of course, are aimed at garnering greater returns with 
lesser risk.
In the next section, I outline some of these “funhouse” indexes: how they are 
created, how they work, and whether they make any financial sense.

62
Part I: The (Mostly) Nonviolent Indexing Revolution 
Making Sense (or Nonsense) 
of the Old and New
Before I introduce you to some of the newer indexes and the methodology 
(and sometimes the touch of madness) behind them, I want to quickly 
review the older indexes and the traditional methodologies behind them. 
Then I’ll ask you to hold onto your pork pie hats, as I take you on a tour of 
the new-to-primetime.
Examining the tried and true
As I discuss in Chapter 2, the mother of all indexes, the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average, and her first-born son, the Standard & Poor’s 500, laid the frame-
work for years of indexing to come. Both of the older indexes base their mir-
roring of the markets on a representative sampling, as do nearly all indexes. 
(A perfect “entire market” index can’t exist for more than perhaps a few 
hours because new securities are born every day, while others fade away.)
In the case of the Dow, the sampling originally included 12 stocks; today the 
number is 30. Each stock is given a weight in the portfolio based on the price 
of the stock.
Since the price of a stock can be somewhat arbitrary, the index, when you 
think about it, doesn’t really make a lot of sense. (Back in the day it was 
formed, before sophisticated calculators, it made more sense because it was 
the easiest way to calculate market value with a pencil and paper.) And yet, 
over the course of history, perhaps just out of dumb luck (I believe dumb 
luck contributes to a lot in this universe . . . and may even explain the uni-
verse itself!), the Dow hasn’t done such a terribly poor job of mirroring the 
U.S. stock market at large. The S&P 500, however, generally does a better job.
The S&P 500 includes 500 stocks that are all given a weighting based on their 
market capitalization. This — the so-called cap-weighted index — has come 
to be the standard in the industry and what we normally mean when we use 
the words traditional index. Cap-weighted indexes may include any number of 
companies. Each one is given a weight proportionate to the total dollar value 
of all stocks issued by the corporation.
Grasping weightings and valuations
If the (fictional) Ace Noodle company issues, say, a million shares, and 
each share is worth $50, the total capitalization of that company would 
be $50 million. Ace Noodle would then have twice as much influence on a 

63
 Chapter 5: A New Era Begins: ETFs and Alternative Indexes
cap-weighted index, such as the S&P 500, as would another (fictional) company 
called Amalgamated Fruitcake that was worth only $25 million. If the entire 
index were to represent, say, $500 million, and Ace Noodle were to shoot up 
10 percent, then the index would rise 1 percent (or 1 point). If Amalgamated 
Fruitcake were to rise 10 percent, the index would go up only half a point. Ditto 
percentage should either Ace or Amalgamated take a tumble.
Most of the common indexes today are cap-weighted indexes, includ-
ing numerous offerings from Dow Jones Wilshire, Standard & Poor’s, 
Morningstar, Morgan Stanley (MSCI), and Russell.
Within the realm of cap-weighted indexes, there are nuances. Some indexes 
look at all the stock in existence, regardless of who holds that stock. These 
babies are called full cap indexes.
Other cap-weighted indexes include only shares of stock available to the 
unwashed masses (people like you and me), excluding shares that are pri-
vately held (usually by executive types). These puppies are referred to as 
free float indexes.
Yet others — so-called constrained or capped indexes — put limits on the 
degree to which the largest stocks can influence the index. Ace Noodle, for 
example, might get a 10 percent allocation of the index even if the People’s 
Republic of China were to order a trillion pounds of noodles.
In the next chapter, and throughout Part II, I discuss what these differences 
in how the indexes are formulated can mean to your portfolio, and how they 
should influence you in picking the best index funds.
Introducing newer variations 
(and variations on variations)
Move over, traditional indexes! Well, maybe not quite yet.
The traditional indexes formed the foundation on which index investing, by 
and large, was based up till a few years ago. Few people complained because 
index investing has paid off handsomely. But there were indications that one 
might be able to do even better.
One particular mutual fund company called Dimensional Fund Advisors (also 
known as DFA), for example, began experimenting years ago with indexes that 
sought to capture the performance of the entire market but to “lean” toward 
value (bargain basement) stocks and small-company stocks. These stocks, 
studies show, have a decades-long performance record that exceeds the per-
formance records of large-company and growth-company (popular-but-pricey) 
stocks.

64
Part I: The (Mostly) Nonviolent Indexing Revolution 
I talk more about the value and small cap lean in Chapter 7 and throughout 
Part III. Dimensional, in my mind, has pioneered what has come recently 
to be known as fundamental indexing: indexing designed to capture pos-
sible pluses in the market that may contribute to enhanced performance. 
(Dimensional eschews the term fundamental indexing and prefers to refer to 
its brand of indexing as enhanced. So be it.)
Fundamental (enhanced) indexing may have started with Dimensional (whose 
funds are available only to institutional investors and fee-only financial advi-
sors), but it has branched out in a thousand directions since the advent of ETFs.
Russell’s indexing report card
One purpose of an index may be to serve as a 
foundation for an investment (such as an index 
mutual fund or exchange-traded fund). With 
that as its purpose, some indexes do a much 
better job than others.
Here’s a quick grading system for judging 
whether a particular index is a potential star 
performer or a dud, and whether that index 
deserve a berth in your portfolio:
 ✓ Does the index make sense? Broad-based 
indexes that track entire markets make 
sense, because most markets go up over 
time. But what about a very narrow index, 
such as, say, an index of companies work-
ing on cancer cures? Is that really the basis 
for a solid investment? If one company finds 
a cure for cancer, its stock is certain to 
soar. But what of the stock of all the other 
companies in the index?
 ✓ Is there a straightforward and objective 
selection criteria? If the stocks that go 
into an index are picked randomly or sub-
jectively, you are looking at a variation of 
active management. Active management 
doesn’t have a very successful track record. 
Indexes put together behind curtains may 
be best left behind curtains.
 ✓ Is the index stable? If an index changes too 
often, any investment tracking that index 
is going to incur both trading costs and 
extra taxation. Equal-weighted indexes, 
for example, must trade fairly frequently to 
remain equally weighted.
 ✓ Does the index fit your financial needs? 
Some indexes — such as, say, a short-
term bond index — are going to come with 
little volatility and little potential return. 
Other indexes — such as, say, small cap 
value stocks, or commodities — will come 
with considerably more volatility but much 
greater potential return. One kind of index 
isn’t necessarily better or worse than the 
other. But your portfolio, based on your 
personal finances, may or may not warrant 
a certain level of risk and return. You must 
find your own risk–return sweet spot and 
then determine if a particular index helps 
you or hinders you from achieving it.
 ✓ Is the index too hot to touch? When a cer-
tain kind of investment is riding especially 
high (lately it has been emerging-market 
stocks and commodities, especially oil), a 
bevy of new index investments based on 
that kind of investment is bound to hit the 
market. But buying into something when 
that something is red hot is often not such 
a terribly good idea. All investment types go 
through cycles. In the long run, you want to 
buy low and sell high — not (as most inves-
tors continually do) buy high and sell low!

65
 Chapter 5: A New Era Begins: ETFs and Alternative Indexes
Figuring Out Fundamental 
Indexes and Beyond
Dimensional’s proprietary indexes identify value stocks by looking mostly at 
price-to-book ratios. (Price-to-book refers to the value of the stock as it relates 
to the value of the total company’s assets.) The lower the price-to-book ratio 
(the more deeply valued a stock), the greater representation that stock is 
given in a Dimensional index. There are some good reasons — foremost the 
history of stock returns — to think that Dimensional’s particular brand of 
fundamental indexing may offer real long-term benefits. I discuss this topic in 
Chapter 7.
But other fundamental indexes of more recent vintage are using other measure-
ments, such as dividend yield, growth of dividend yield, total company rev-
enue, and price-to-earnings ratios, as criteria by which the indexes are weighed.
Whether buying index funds that track such fundamental indexes will prove 
wise in the long run is highly questionable and a subject of much debate 
today among financial experts.
Promoting the uncertain 
with a positive spin
 
Fundamental indexing–based ETFs have been advertised extensively in the 
past couple of years. Many of them have shown great success in garnering 
outsized performance using back-testing. In other words, the indexes are given 
performance records as if they existed 10 or 15 years ago. Back-testing, as you 
can imagine, has great limitations. In fact, back-testing, especially if performed 
by someone who has a vested interest in showing positive results, can be 
almost worthless.
Silly example: If you wanted to create an index, for example, that “proved” 
that the Philadelphia Eagles was a better football team than the New York 
Giants, you could do so. Simply show the two teams’ wins and losses, but do 
so during a time frame when the Eagles were hot and the Giants were not.
Similarly, if you wanted to “prove” that high dividend–paying stocks were a 
more profitable investment than stocks that typically don’t pay dividends 
(which isn’t necessarily the case — trust me), you could choose a time frame 
in which high dividend–paying stocks soared. That happens to have been the 
case over the past several years, which may explain why ETFs linked to fun-
damental indexes that favor high dividend–paying stocks have been selling 
like hotcakes. (Well, they were at least until the collapse of financial stocks — 
which tend to pay high dividends — in October, 2008.)

66
Part I: The (Mostly) Nonviolent Indexing Revolution 
 
It is simply unknown whether fundamental indexes will wind up as better foun-
dations for index investments than the traditional indexes. I have my doubts. 
Markets are efficient. If an index of, say, high dividend–paying stocks winds up 
outperforming all other stocks for a good enough number of years, the market 
will eventually catch on, raising the price of high dividend–paying stocks to a 
point that they will no longer have an edge.
As much as I like my practically hometown Philadelphia Eagles, they aren’t 
going to be a top NFL team for all eternity, even though they’ve had a few 
good years of late.
Also bear in mind that fundamental indexes, which aim to beat the markets, 
tend to charge investors considerably more for that presumed edge. Most of 
the WisdomTree ETFs charge 0.58 percent a year in operating fees, and most 
of the PowerShares ETFs charge 0.60 percent. That compares to 0.22 percent 
or less for the majority of Vanguard’s traditional-index ETFs.
Getting even with equal-weighted indexes
Another kind of alternative index that has caught on to a great degree of 
late is the equal-weighted index. If an equal-weighted index includes, say, 50 
stocks, each stock is worth 1/50 of the index. A large company, such as Ace 
Noodle, would carry no more weight than would a smaller company, such as 
Amalgamated Fruitcake.
At first glance, it may seem that such an index would be better diversified 
than an index in which Ace Noodle would have too much sway. And that may 
be the case in certain circumstances.
 
You need to remember, though, that Ace Noodle, being a large and more 
stable company, is likely to be less volatile than Amalgamated Fruitcake. So 
giving the latter company an equal weighting will inevitably result in an index 
that is more volatile than a traditional cousin. When smaller stocks are doing 
great guns, you’ll want an equal-weighted index. When larger stocks are forg-
ing ahead, you’ll wish you had stuck to the traditional.
 
You want to keep in mind, too, that equal-weighted indexes require much 
more juggling than do cap-weighted indexes. If Ace Noodle doubles in size 
next year, it simply doubles its relative importance in the cap-weighted 
index. At the same time, unless the entire index doubles, the manager of the 
equal-weighted index has to sell off a boatload of Ace Noodle stock and buy 
something else to take its place. Such buys and sells create added costs to the 
investor and possibly ugly tax consequences.

67
 Chapter 5: A New Era Begins: ETFs and Alternative Indexes
The leader, at least so far, in equal-weighted indexing has been Rydex 
Investments. Through Rydex, you can get ETFs that track equal-weighted 
indexes of all sorts and flavors, including the broad-market Rydex S&P 
Equal Weight Index ETF (RSP) and any number of equal-weighted industry 
sector ETFs, such as the Rydex S&P Equal Weight Consumer Discretionary 
ETF (RCD), the Rydex S&P Equal Weight Consumer Staples ETF (RHS), the 
Rydex S&P Equal Weight Energy ETF (RYE), and the Rydex S&P Equal Weight 
Financials ETF (RYF).
The role that such ETFs may play — or not play — in your portfolio is dis-
cussed in Chapter 7.
Creating seemingly sociable 
screened indexes
A variation of sorts on fundamental indexing, screening is the process not of 
picking stocks to include in the index, but rather of picking stocks to exclude. 
Perhaps the most common use of screening is to weed out companies that 
are not so much financially undesirable as socially undesirable. By so doing, 
it becomes possible to be a socially responsible index investor, if one so 
desires. Granted, “socially responsible” is a subjective term.
The oldest and best-known such index is the Domini 400 Social Index, cre-
ated in 1990. Investors wishing to track this index can purchase shares of the 
Green Century Equity Fund (GCEQX).The majority of companies in the index 
come from the S&P 500. Companies are screened based on their performance 
records on environmental issues (such as waste disposal, toxic emissions, 
fines, and penalties), as well as on social issues (such as employee relations, 
corporate citizenship, product-related issues, and attitudes regarding con-
sumer issues).
The Calvert Social Index Fund (CSXAX), launched in June 2000, is based on the 
Calvert Social Index. Calvert takes the 1,000 largest companies in the United 
States and applies its particular brand of social criteria to create the index.
An outfit called KLD Research & Analytics has recently taken the lead in cre-
ating screened indexes, some of which are already being tracked by ETFs, 
and others of which are sure to follow. These indexes include the venerable 
Domini 400 Social Index (discussed earlier in this section), the KLD Catholic 
Values 400 Index, the KLD Global Climate 100 Index, and the KLD Global 
Sustainability Index. It also has created such indexes as the KLD Dividend 
Achievers Social Index — a combination of socially responsible and funda-
mental index.

68
Part I: The (Mostly) Nonviolent Indexing Revolution 
If you want to explore socially screened indexes more, I give some pointers 
(for stock investing) in Chapter 7 and (for bond investing) in Chapter 8.
Oh — there are also indexes (are you ready for this?) that allow you to invest 
in companies that are socially irresponsible! Yes, you can focus your invest-
ments, if you wish, on tobacco, gambling, alcohol, and weapons of mass 
destruction. Ugh.
Turning the world upside down 
with inverse indexes
An inverse index is indeed a strange beast. Unlike other indexes, which 
track the growth of markets, inverse indexes do best when the market 
shrinks or sinks.
Inverse indexes have been around for some time. They were pioneered by 
the folks at ProFunds, who ran and still run mutual funds, and now offer 
ETFs, as well, based on the upside-down beasts. Other major players include 
Rydex Investments and Direxion Funds.
 
Funds that track inverse indexes are often touted (by the companies that 
hawk them) as the perfect diversification tools. After all, if the rest of your 
holdings are going down, these babies are guaranteed to go up! Whoa . . . 
not so fast! Yes, having two different investments that zig and zag is the very 
essence of diversification — a good thing! But you also want different invest-
ments that tend to go up over time.
 
Investments tied to inverse indexes have a miserable history of losing money 
over the long run. You have much better diversification options, as I discuss 
in Part II. The ETFs based on inverse indexes are for market-timers, and 
market-timers typically make lousy investors.
Keeping hands completely off 
with unmanaged indexes
Some may argue that unmanaged indexes are the purest of the pure when it 
comes to indexes. An unmanaged index starts, like any other index, with an 
attempt to use sample securities to measure a particular market. The differ-
ence between unmanaged indexes and all others is that the unmanaged index 
remains static . . . always!

69
 Chapter 5: A New Era Begins: ETFs and Alternative Indexes
That’s the deal with HOLDRS, which are index funds very much like ETFs, 
issued by Merrill Lynch. These are baskets of stocks that, according to 
Merrill, represent a certain industry sector. There’s one, for example, that 
tracks the biotech industry (BBH), another that tracks the Internet business 
(HHH), and one that mirrors the semiconductor industry (SMH).
Because these indexes are cap-weighted, and they never change their lineup 
of companies, they can become very concentrated if one or two companies 
happen to grow much more than the others.
 
At the time of this writing, for example, the Internet HOLDR (HHH), created 
in 1992, is made up of 12 companies. But the last several on the list, including 
Earthlink and Priceline, make up doodly-squat. More than 86 percent of the 
index is composed of just four companies: Yahoo!, Amazon, eBay, and Time 
Warner.
One of hallmarks of a good index is that there should be better diversification 
than that!
Say, can you really call this an index?!
The very latest wrinkle in indexing is the advent of the so-called active index. 
If ever there were an oxymoron, this is it! And yet, active indexes are spawn-
ing an entire second stage of the ETF revolution.
I find it perhaps ironic that the very first actively managed ETF was intro-
duced by Bear Stearns in March 2008 — just as Bear Stearns was on the brink 
of bankruptcy!
That fund, the Bear Stearns Current Yield Fund (YYY), is based on an “index” 
of largely bonds and other debt obligations. Although I find the entire idea 
of active indexing a bit crazy, it may actually have an edge on other kinds of 
active investing. More on this in Part II.
The great index quiz
Once upon a time . . . financial indexes were 
delightful and simple things, designed to help 
measure the ups and downs and sideways of 
financial markets. There was the venerable 
S&P 500, the Dow, and a few assorted and 
sundry others. These indexes tended to be cap-
weighted, and they tracked large segments of 
the market.
In past years, however, we’ve seen a virtual 
explosion of indexes. Today, thanks in large 
part to the exponential growth of exchange-
traded funds (ETFs), you can find indexes that 
track just about anything, constructed in myriad 
and sometimes oh-so-questionable ways. Many 
are being birthed for the sole purpose of creat-
ing an ETF that can then track the newfangled 

70
Part I: The (Mostly) Nonviolent Indexing Revolution 
index. The tail is wagging the dog — and the 
dog is sometimes getting delirious!
Here, I present a list of a dozen indexes. Most 
of them are real, with real ETFs that track them. 
Some of them — well, I just created them for the 
fun of it; they are pure fantasy. Can you tell the 
real indexes from the make-believe indexes? 
(Answers are at the bottom.)
 1. ISE-Revere Wal-Mart Supplier Index. Ever 
walk into Wal-Mart and wonder if you 
could somehow buy shares of the com-
panies that generate most of their sales 
from the world’s most humongous retailer? 
Well, you can. The FocusShares Wal-Mart 
Supplier ETF is based on the ISE-Revere 
Wal-Mart Supplier Index, which tracks the 
performance of 30 companies that derive 
a substantial portion of their revenue from 
Wal-Mart.
 2. The GI/Gender Health Index. This index 
invests in healthcare, life sciences, and/or 
biotechnology companies that have been 
identified as gastrointestinal/genitouri-
nary/gender health companies. Companies 
included in the GI/Gender Health Index are 
engaged in the research, clinical develop-
ment, and/or commercialization of thera-
peutic agents for the treatment of a wide 
variety of diseases.
 3. MSCI Oil Derivatives Index. This one 
gauges the performance of companies 
manufacturing, processing, delivering, or 
storing petroleum byproducts and other 
derivatives of oil production. The index 
includes equities in selected companies 
that meet the profile, but may also include 
options and other derivatives of the deriva-
tives, so to speak.
 4. Credit Suisse Global Warming Index. It 
tracks a variety of stocks that analysts 
believe will benefit from the global push 
toward lower emissions.
 5. Pacific ex-Japan Dividend Index. This one 
measures the performance of dividend-pay-
ing companies incorporated in the Pacific 
region, excluding Japan. The index is com-
prised of companies incorporated in Hong 
Kong, Singapore, Australia, or New Zealand 
that meet other requirements necessary to 
be included in the index. Companies are 
weighted in the index based on annual cash 
dividends paid.
 6. ISE-CCM Homeland Security Index. The 
U.S. government has put a top priority on 
counterterrorism, law enforcement, and the 
securing of its national borders. The top 30 
companies at the forefront of such efforts 
comprise the FocusShares Homeland 
Security ETF, which is based on the ISE-
CCM Homeland Security Index, the fund’s 
benchmark index for the critical homeland 
security sector.
 7. BARRA North American REIT Index. This 
index reflects the performance of real 
estate investment trusts that benefit from 
the growth of highway and railroad infra-
structure throughout the United States, 
Canada, and Mexico.
 8. The Fortune 500 Index. It invests in secu-
rities that are known to be held by those 
investors in last year’s listing of the U.S.’s 
wealthiest people per Fortune magazine. 
The index aims to capitalize on the collec-
tive brainpower of the nation’s most power-
ful investors.
 9. The Super Bowl 20 Index. Companies 
whose commercials played during last 
year’s Super Bowl and were given most 
acclaim by television viewers are included 
in this index. The historical performance 
of the index (retrospectively) gives solid 
indication that a favorable showing on 
America’s most-viewed show is a good 
barometer of annual sales growth.

71
 Chapter 5: A New Era Begins: ETFs and Alternative Indexes
 10. The CEOpay Index. It starts with the S&P 
500 and eliminates those corporations 
where the ratio of CEO compensation to 
the compensation of the average employee 
exceeds 500. The rationale behind the index, 
formed in 2007, is that overfed CEOs both 
bleed a corporation of financial resources 
and damage employee morale.
 11. Dow Jones BRIC 50 Index. Designed to 
provide balanced representation across 
four markets, this index targets 5 stocks 
for Russia and 15 each for Brazil, India, 
and China. Stocks are selected within each 
country based on size and liquidity, and 
then the selections are aggregated to form 
the index.
 12. Dow Jones BRAC 50 Index. This index is 
designed to provide balanced representa-
tion across three markets, all somewhat 
tangential to the continental European 
market. Targeting 20 stocks for Britain, 20 
for Austria, and 10 for the Czech Republic, 
the selections are aggregated based on 
size and liquidity to form the index.
Answers: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 11 are the real indexes. 
(But I seriously wish someone would create 
number 10 as well.)

Getting to Know 
Your Index Fund 
Choices

In this part . . .
N
ow that you know the rhyme and reason behind 
index funds, it’s time to stop looking at them as a 
single entity and to do some comparing and contrasting of 
the various index fund options. Not all index funds are 
created equal. Some are born as mutual funds, others as 
exchange-traded funds. Some track the stock market, 
others the bond market. Some track investments that 
may be considered a bit wild and crazy. Most index funds 
have low expense ratios, but others, alas, are brazen 
rip-offs. Some are more tax efficient than others. When all 
is said and done, some are clearly better investments than 
others. After reading the next four chapters, you will be a

ndex investing bears more similarity to U.S. politics than it does to, say, 
European or Asian politics in that it is largely a two-party system. You can 
plunk your money into mutual funds (which was the ruling party for many 
years), or you can invest in exchange-traded funds (otherwise known as ETFs).
Oh, sure, you can invest in something exotic, such as a unit investment trust, 
just like you can vote for Ralph Nader for president. But you can bet your 
paycheck that Ralph isn’t going to become president because the political 
landscape is dominated by the Democrats and Republicans. And the invest-
ing landscape is similarly certain to be dominated by two prevailing forces 
for some time to come.
Although not yet nearly as popular as mutual funds, ETFs have caught on 
very rapidly in the past decade or so. In 2006, while I was writing Exchange-
Traded Funds For Dummies, investors had about $320 billion deposited 
in about 200 ETFs. Investors now have more than $650 billion invested in 
roughly 700 ETFs.
And mutual funds? A couple years ago, the sum total invested in mutual 
funds was $9.2 trillion; today it stands at roughly $8.5 trillion. At the moment 
I’m writing this page, the market is slightly up from a couple of years ago, so 
the majority of this decline is due to the emigration of money from mutual 
funds to ETFs.

Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
While ETFs are slowly muscling in on mutual funds (I strongly suspect they 
may surpass mutual funds in the next decade or so), ETFs have already 
become nearly an equal competitor in the arena of index investing. That’s 
because practically all of the $650 billion invested in ETFs is indexed. Of the 
trillions invested in mutual funds, on the other hand, only a fraction of that — 
about $840 million, according to Morningstar — is indexed.
In the first part of this kickoff-to-Part-II chapter, I help you understand and 
appreciate the differences between index mutual funds and ETFs so that you 
can better “vote” with your money.
The second half of this chapter aims to help you understand the indexes that 
form the bases for both ETFs and index mutual funds. Those indexes are the 
foundations on which your index investments — whether ETFs, mutual funds, 
or Ralph Nader–type investments — lie. Just as even the best recipe still 
relies on good ingredients, any ETF, mutual fund, or other investment worth 
your consideration needs to be based on a good, solid, logical index.
After you have a handle on what these investment vehicles are all about, I 
invite you to cruise the rest of the chapters of Part II, where I help you to pick 
from among the hordes upon hordes (with more hordes arriving daily!) of 
index mutual funds and ETFs on the market.
Riding the Index Vehicle
Both kinds of index funds — ETFs and mutual funds — represent baskets of 
securities. Usually the securities are stocks or bonds, although they could 
also be commodities such as oil or gold, or something slightly more exotic, 
like preferred stock.
ETFs differ from mutual funds mostly in how they trade. Whereas mutual 
funds are purchased directly from a fund company, ETFs trade on the open 
markets, like stocks. This allows you to do all kinds of fancy things with ETFs 
that you can’t do with mutual funds, such as buying options or shorting them.
(Options allow for high leveraging of your investments; you put a modest 
amount of money down now for the right to buy or sell a stock at a certain 
price in the future. Shorting a fund is a market-timing maneuver that banks on 
a downfall. If the index that the ETF counter-mirrors loses money, you actu-
ally win. Neither strategy is typically very successful for the small, unprofes-
sional investor.)

77
 Chapter 6: The Basic Index Investing Components
 
ETFs also trade throughout the day. You can buy or sell at a moment’s notice, 
and you can buy or sell at whatever price the market brings, whether at 10 
a.m. on a Monday morning or 3 p.m. on a Thursday afternoon. Mutual funds, 
on the other hand, are traded only at the end of the day; you cannot pinpoint 
your price.
As far as buying and holding either an ETF or a mutual fund (buying and 
holding is my favorite form of investing, as I discuss in Chapter 16), the differ-
ences between the two kinds of funds are largely academic.
 
The similarities between, say, an S&P 500 mutual fund and an S&P ETF are far 
greater than the differences. (Some say the same thing about Democrats and 
Republicans, but let’s not go there.)
All the same, knowing a few things about the basic structure for ETFs and 
mutual funds can’t hurt. Follow me!
Investing collectively through 
mutual funds
A mutual fund is a pooled investment, a repository for money, just like a 
library is a repository for books.
Lots of investors (so-called shareholders of the mutual fund) buy into the 
pool, and a manager or team of managers — the “librarian” — decides how 
to best invest the collective money. The managers may invest the money in 
stocks, bonds, or just about anything else in the hopes of earning sharehold-
ers a profit.
Dating back to England in the 1800s, mutual funds today account for the vast 
majority of household investments in the United States. Most mutual funds 
today are part of large fund companies, such as Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, or 
Charles Schwab. Fidelity, for example, is sort of like the Wal-Mart of financial 
supermarkets. It now offers 350 of its own funds, and many of those come in 
various classes.
Most, if not all, of the large fund companies offer index mutual funds. Fidelity, 
for example, offers 20 index funds. Table 6-1 lists the six largest index mutual 
funds as of this writing.

Some fund companies, like The Vanguard Group and Dimensional, special-
ize in index funds. The majority of Vanguard’s stock funds are indexed, and 
nearly all of Dimensional’s are.
But about 95 percent of mutual funds, including the majority of those run by 
Fidelity, Charles Schwab, T. Rowe Price, and others, are actively run. That 
means that the manager or managers in charge are picking certain securities 
or trying to time their buying and selling of securities in the hopes of beating 
the pants off of, rather than mirroring, the markets. They usually don’t suc-
ceed, but they keep trying.
Mutual funds may be cheap or expensive, well run or poorly run, good 
investments or bad. Because so much of the nation’s money is tied up in 
mutual funds — they literally are the market — it is virtually impossible that 
the average mutual fund can beat the market. On average and collectively, 
mutual funds will do about as well as the market, minus their expense ratios 
and minus the taxes resulting from trades.
 
In large part because index mutual funds are the least expensive of all mutual 
funds — in terms of management fees, trading expenses, and taxes — they 
tend to show better long-term performance than the rest of the pack and, 
therefore, are generally the better bet for your money.
When you invest in a mutual fund, you either purchase shares directly from 
the mutual fund company, or you can go to a financial supermarket, such as 
a Fidelity or a Charles Schwab, and purchase mutual funds from a variety 
of mutual fund companies through a funds network. Fidelity, for example, 
in addition to offering its own 350 funds, will allow you to purchase more 
than 4,000 funds from other companies through its Fund Network. Of those, 
roughly 1,100 can be purchased without a fee. The remainder will generally 
cost you $75 to buy. (They cost nothing to sell, if held for at least 90 days.)

 Chapter 6: The Basic Index Investing Components
Putting your money into 
the more modern ETF
Dating back only to the early 1990s, ETFs, like mutual funds, represent bas-
kets of securities. Unlike mutual funds, you don’t purchase ETFs from the 
companies that bundle the securities; you purchase them on an exchange, 
such as the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ, just as you would pur-
chase stocks.
Until very recently, all ETFs were index funds. Only as I was writing this book 
did several actively managed ETFs hit the market. It is still questionable 
whether they will take off and survive. At present, they are miniscule. (I hope 
they stay that way!)
 
ETFs tend to carry very low expense ratios, but they do require a commission 
to buy and sell them. Usually, the commission is small (perhaps $10 or so). 
Any brokerage house or financial supermarket will allow you to buy and sell 
any ETF. They are unlike mutual funds in that regard. You cannot necessarily 
purchase any mutual fund through any brokerage house.
Table 6-2 shows the six largest ETFs as of this writing.

As far as index investing is concerned, ETFs offer a much wider variety than 
do mutual funds. That’s because even though there are more mutual funds 
than ETFs, only about 5 percent of mutual funds are index mutual funds (the 
remainder are actively run funds). And of the index mutual funds, many track 
the same indexes, such as the S&P 500. There are, in fact, dozens of index 
mutual funds that track the S&P 500!

80
Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
In contrast, you can buy an ETF that tracks every index imaginable, from 
entire stock and bond markets to narrow industry market niches, and from 
large geographical regions (such as Asia and Europe) to individual countries 
(large and small). ETFs also allow you to buy investments that track both tra-
ditional indexes (such as the S&P 500 or the Dow) and all sorts of newfangled 
indexes based on myriad algorithms and investment theories. Table 6-3 gives 
you a taste of the variety you can sample, as of September, 2008.

Facing off: Mutual funds versus ETFs
Let’s forget for a moment about which index you wish to track. It doesn’t 
matter whether it is stocks or bonds, U.S. or foreign securities, something 
high-flying like tech stocks or ultraconservative like Treasuries. There are 
certain things you should look for in any index fund, whether it’s a mutual 
fund or an ETF.
Here are some of the key questions you need to ask yourself in deciding 
whether you want a mutual fund or an ETF portfolio — or some combination 
thereof:
 
✓ How well does the investment vehicle track the index?
 
✓ What kind of expenses are we talking about?
 
✓ What tax consequences are you likely to encounter?

81
 Chapter 6: The Basic Index Investing Components
 
✓ Do you need up-to-the-moment pricing?
 
✓ How transparent is the fund? (Do you know exactly what you’re buying?)
 
✓ Do you need the fancy stuff, like the ability to buy options or short 
the fund?
 
In some cases, such as if you think you require options, your choice between 
a mutual fund and an ETF will be clear: You’ll need an ETF. In most cases, how-
ever, it will be a judgment call. Neither index mutual funds nor ETFs are neces-
sarily better than the other. In each of the chapters that follows, I try to point 
you to specific funds that beat the pack. They may be mutual funds, or they 
may be ETFs.
 
Often, what’s better for you will depend on your particular circumstances. 
ETFs, which tend to be a bit cheaper than mutual funds, are often your best 
option for buy-and-hold investing. For money that is regularly invested in 
small amounts, or for an investment that you may need to tap with any regu-
larity, mutual funds may be better, as you can avoid the commissions charged 
on ETFs.
Because ETFs tend to be a bit more tax-efficient than mutual funds, they may 
also be a better bet, all other things being equal, in a taxable account.
Table 6-4 spells out some of the similarities and differences between these 
two investment options.

Spotting Rare Birds in the 
Index Investing Forest
Not all index funds are mutual funds or ETFs. There are two other options 
worth knowing about, even though they are far less common. These are 
exchange-traded notes and unit investment trusts.
Exchange-traded notes (ETNs)
According to Barclays Bank, the outfit that spearheaded ETNs, these are 
“senior, unsecured, unsubordinated debt securities . . . designed to provide 
investors with a new way to access the returns of market benchmarks or 
strategies.” In other words, they are strange ducks indeed.
Technically, when you buy an ETN (which you do on an open exchange, just 
as you would an ETF) you are buying a debt instrument sort of like a bond. If 
the issuer goes under — poof! — you lose your money. Otherwise, you get a 
“rate of return” — somewhat similar to interest on a bond but much less pre-
dictable — that is linked to the index the ETN is tracking.
Unlike ETFs, most of the ETNs in existence track commodity and currency 
indexes. The issuer may do all sorts of fancy maneuvers to track these often 
difficult-to-track indexes, but all that matters to you (as long as the issuer 
remains solvent) is that you get a rate of return equal to any growth (or 
shrinkage) in the value of the index. I talk more about ETNs in Chapter 9. Yes, 
they can sometimes make for good investments.
Unit investment trusts (UITs)
A UIT most resembles a mutual fund with an expiration date. You buy into 
a UIT, often as you would buy into a mutual fund, and you become a share-
holder of a basket of securities — stocks or bonds, usually — that were 
either hand-picked by a manager or that represent an index.
Some UITs mature in relatively short periods of time — say, within 5 years —
 at which point you take your money and go home. Others may not mature 
for as much as 30 years. Some of these longer-duration UITs are traded on 
exchanges and bear much resemblance to ETFs. In fact, they bear so much 
resemblance to ETFs that they are often referred to as ETFs, and I may do so 
myself later in this book.

83
 Chapter 6: The Basic Index Investing Components
Meeting the Major Index Makers
The biggest and brawniest of all indexes is the Standard & Poor’s 500. More 
investment dollars are linked to the S&P 500 than to all other indexes com-
bined. I’m not saying that you shouldn’t invest your money in the S&P 500, 
but there’s no question in my mind that most people (and institutions) do so 
out of sheer laziness. There are many indexes out there, and many of them 
may make better foundations for your investments than the Big Kahuna.
In this section, I introduce you to the indexes that form the foundations for 
much index investing, and I invite you to meet the major index makers.
Standard & Poor’s
As the producer of the world’s most oft-quoted index, by far, Standard & 
Poor’s — a division of McGraw-Hill — enjoys the catbird seat among index 
makers and shakers.
The S&P 500
S&P’s flagship product, the S&P 500, forms the foundation for four ETFs — 
including the oldest and largest ETF, the SPDR Trust Series 1 (ticker SPY) — 
and no fewer than 74 distinct index mutual funds. All together, those funds 
are valued at more than $1.53 trillion. (That’s more than the gross domestic 
product of Canada!)
Exchange-traded portfolios/products
Because UITs can resemble ETFs (and so can 
ETNs), some media, such as The Wall Street 
Journal, have recently coined the phrase 
exchange-traded portfolios to describe all bas-
ket-like investments that trade on exchanges, 
whether they are true ETFs, ETNs, or UITs. I’ve 
also seen the term exchange-traded products 
bandied about of late. (Fortunately, exchange-
traded portfolio and exchange-traded products 
carry the very same initials, so you’ll see them 
often referred to as ETPs.)
The term exchange-traded portfolios/products 
may also include closed-end mutual funds, 
which similarly trade on exchanges but, as far 
as I know, never track indexes. All closed-end 
mutual funds are actively managed. The more 
typical mutual fund, the kind of mutual fund 
we usually refer to when we speak of mutual 
funds, is technically known as an open-end 
mutual fund. The open-end funds do not trade 
on exchanges. Because closed-end funds are 
not index funds, I do not discuss them further 
in this book.

84
Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
So what exactly does this behemoth of an index measure? Although it tracks 
the ups and downs of only 500 stocks (out of more than 8,000 publicly traded 
stocks in the United States), those 500 stocks represent approximately three-
quarters of the value of the entire U.S. stock market.
The S&P 500 is a market capitalization index: Larger company stocks get 
to play a more important role in the index. The current top five companies 
are ExxonMobil (3.96 percent of the index), General Electric (2.9 percent), 
Microsoft (2.22 percent), AT&T (1.95 percent), and Procter & Gamble (1.76 
percent).
 
The 500 companies in the index — although they are all good-sized companies,
for sure — are not the 500 largest companies in the land. Rather, they are 
chosen by their standing within their respective industries; each one suppos-
edly is a leader. Two common misconceptions about the S&P 500 are that it is a 
mirror of the entire stock market (yes, but a little bit like a funhouse mirror) and 
that it is an index of all giant companies (close, but no cigar — about 10 percent 
of the companies in the index would be considered mid cap, not large cap).
Other S&P products
Other popular S&P indexes include the S&P 100 (a subset of the S&P 500 
focusing on the largest companies), the S&P Mid Cap 400, the S&P 600 Small 
Cap Index, and the S&P 1500 (which combines the S&P 500 with the Mid Cap 
400 and the 600 Small Cap). S&P also offers the S&P Total Market Index, with 
about 4,500 companies, including teeny weeny microcaps.
Can you create your own index fund?
In a word, no.
Academics have gone back and forth for years 
arguing about how many stocks you would 
need to have in your portfolio to attain true 
diversification — the kind of diversification you 
can have in a flash by investing in an index fund. 
At a bare-bones minimum, you would need, I 
believe, at least 30 stocks, with no one stock 
comprising much more than 3 percent of your 
portfolio, to say you are truly well diversified.
But even then, your “well-diversified” portfo-
lio would represent only, say, U.S. stocks. In 
order to have a portfolio so well-diversified 
as to include U.S. and foreign stocks, stocks 
and bonds, and commodities (not to mention 
exposure to growth stocks and value stocks, 
large caps and small caps), you’d have to have 
dozens upon dozens of securities.
Even if you had the money to invest in such a 
portfolio, the hassles of rebalancing and the 
resulting trading costs would make it very hard 
to come out ahead. Why not spend, if you wish, 
as little as 7/100 of 1 percent a year to own index 
funds (the cost of several Fidelity and Vanguard 
index funds)?
That’s obviously the way to go — even if you 
are super rich.

85
 Chapter 6: The Basic Index Investing Components
In addition, S&P offers a number of international indexes that form the basis 
for many of the SPDR brand of ETFs issued by State Street Global Advisors 
(SSgA), one of the leading ETF producers. And the firm produces style 
indexes (large growth, small value, and so on) used by ETF leader Barclays 
iShares for many of its domestic stock offerings.
S&P has also of late begun to produce a number of equal-weighted indexes — 
both for broad markets and for industry sectors — that certain smaller ETF 
providers, such as Rydex, are using to base their investment products. The 
firm is also busy producing various fundamental, or economic-weighted, 
indexes used by such ETF providers as RevenueShares.
Russell’s review
Popularity, alas, is great if you are a rock star but not so great if you are an 
index.
 
Given the huge amount of dollars invested in the S&P 500 index funds, a com-
pany that joins the S&P 500 index inevitably sees an immediate influx of cash, 
bidding up the price of the stock. If a company leaves the S&P 500, just as 
soon as that is announced to the public, the price of the stock inevitably takes 
a little plunge. The end result of this activity is that managers of S&P 500 funds 
are often forced to buy higher and sell lower than they should — and share-
holders in the funds lose. We’re not talking a lot of loss here — some analysts 
says 1/5 of 1 percentage point a year — but why have to suffer that loss at all? 
Other indexes are broader (better diversified) than the S&P 500, and their lack 
of such extreme popularity will add to your bottom line. I would not necessar-
ily avoid S&P 500 funds (some of them, due to economies of scale, have very 
low management fees), but I wouldn’t put them at the top of the pack, either.
As with all cap-weighted indexes, the S&P 500 and its ilk may give too much 
weight to companies that have growth too big for their britches. Over time, 
some of the newer, fundamental indexes may outperform. But even if the 
indexes outperform, it is still highly questionable whether the funds tracking 
the indexes (which are more expensive than the S&P funds, and generally will 
have greater turnover) will similarly outperform.
The S&P equal-weighted indexes, as well as some of its fundamental or eco-
nomic indexes, are interesting products. I wouldn’t rush to buy a fund based 
on an equal-weighted or other fundamental index, however, without fully 
understanding the ramifications. Many people don’t.
An equal-weighted index, for example, treats small cap companies the same 
as it does large cap companies. That egalitarian approach means that an 
investment based on such an index will offer greater long-term potential 
return but will also carry more risk (volatility) than an investment based 

86
Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
on a conventional index where the largest stocks have the greatest sway. 
Investments based on equal-weighted or other fundamental indexes versus 
conventional indexes also require more turnover, resulting in higher costs 
and possibly greater taxation.
Dow Jones/Dow Jones Wilshire
In Chapter 2, I dub the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) the “Mother 
of All Indexes.” The DJIA dates back to 1896 and, since that time, has been 
quoted more times than Shakespeare, Will Rogers, and Confucius combined. 
The DJIA, which originally consisted of 12 of the nation’s most influential and 
trendsetting companies, now consists of 30, all hand-picked by the editors of 
The Wall Street Journal.
The DJIA
The DJIA is price-weighted, which is a very strange way to construct an 
index. Stocks with higher prices tip the basket more than the others. 
Although it made sense 100 or so years ago (before the advent of electronic 
calculators, or even ballpoint pens), such a strategy really makes little sense 
today. And neither does an index made up of only 30 stocks that purports to 
represent the entire stock market.
 
The DJIA is an anachronism. It is a dinosaur. It is not representative of the 
entire stock market by any means and doesn’t even do a great job of repre-
senting large companies! And yet it continues to be quoted, every single day, 
as a matter of bad habit. (Could it be — shock! — because The Wall Street 
Journal is a Dow Jones newspaper?!) So be it. There are a handful of ETFs and 
index mutual funds that track the DJIA, but I wouldn’t put them on the top of 
my list for most people’s portfolios.
Other products
Dow Jones, however, produces several thousand other indexes that track 
every conceivable slice and sliver of the U.S. stock market, along with the 
stock markets of other nations.
In 2004, Dow Jones partnered up with the folks at Wilshire Associates, a 
California firm that had been producing its own popular indexes for a good 
number of years, to co-brand a series of indexes that measure the market 
at large. These include the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000, which aims to capture 
the return of the entire U.S. stock market — and does so rather well. And it 
includes the Dow Jones Wilshire 4500, which is essentially the Dow Jones 
Wilshire 5000 minus the S&P 500. The DJW 4500 is a very common measure 
for all the mid cap and small cap stocks of the land.

87
 Chapter 6: The Basic Index Investing Components
Unlike the clunky and anachronistic DJIA, the Dow Jones Wilshire 4500 
(which, at the moment, actually contains more than 4,900 stocks — go figure) 
and the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 (which currently has more than 5,400 
stocks) are both market cap–weighted. And unlike the DJIA, which replaces 
companies only when the editors of The Wall Street Journal are having a slow 
day and feel like issuing a press release, the Dow Jones Wilshire indexes 
update monthly.
At present, the five largest holdings in the DJW 5000 are ExxonMobil (3.32 
percent of the index), General Electric (2.2 percent), Microsoft (1.6 percent), 
Procter & Gamble (1.4 percent), and AT&T (1.4 percent). The top five in the 
DJW 4500 are Genentech (1 percent of the index), The Mosaic Company (0.5 
percent), Bunge (0.4 percent), MasterCard (0.4 percent), and McDermott 
International (0.4 percent).
Dow Jones, like S&P, has recently gotten into the business of producing fun-
damental indexes based on various economic factors, and some of these are 
packaged in the form of ETFs. The iShares Dow Jones Select Dividend Index, 
for example, is both an index and an ETF that tracks the index, which over-
weights companies that pay relatively fat dividends.
Russell’s review
The DJIA is not the best index for your investments to track. On the other 
hand, if you already own an ETF or mutual fund that tracks the DJIA, you 
could do worse — don’t panic! Read Chapter 7 and decide if another stock 
index fund — perhaps based on a broader (more diversified) and more logi-
cally weighted index — may suit your purposes better.
If you’re going to have only one U.S. stock index to base your investments 
on, the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 is a pretty good choice — not optimal, but 
pretty good. The Dow Jones Wilshire 4500 is not at all a bad representative of 
mid cap and small cap U.S. equities. I reveal optimal choices in Chapter 7!
Lehman Brothers
Personally, I’d just as soon be a tamer of lions with attitude than try to create 
a fixed-income index, so I’m glad Lehman Brothers is in business to do it for 
us. Indexing bonds is much, much trickier than indexing stocks. The reason: 
There are only several thousand public issues of stock being offered in the 
United States versus literally millions of bonds.
A large company like Johnson & Johnson or Coca-Cola, for example, may 
issue one, two, or possibly three kinds of stock. But such a company may 
issue hundreds of series of bonds, each with its own coupon rate, callability 

88
Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
features, and guarantees. The U.S. government and government agencies col-
lectively issue more bonds than McDonald’s makes hamburgers. And then 
there are the many, many municipalities that sell bonds to raise money for 
road repairs and bridges and such.
Lehman Brothers, the producers of such popular bond indexes as the Lehman 
Aggregate Bond Index, figures out how to take representative samples from the 
enormous bond universe and turn them into a workable index. Bless them.
 
The Lehman Aggregate Bond Index is far and away the nation’s most popular 
and broadest index for fixed-income securities. It tracks the performance of 
the entire U.S. investment-grade (high quality) bond market, which includes 
U.S. Treasury bonds, agency bonds, corporate bonds, and mortgage-backed 
securities.
At present, there are three ETFs and several dozen mutual funds that track 
the Lehman Aggregate Bond Index. Lehman offers hundreds of other indexes 
that track everything from high-yield (junk) bonds and municipal bonds to 
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and convertible bonds.
Russell’s review
If you’re going to have only one bond holding, by all means, owning an ETF or 
index mutual fund that tracks the Lehman Aggregate Bond Index isn’t a bad 
way to go — provided you want a taxable bond portfolio, you’re using the 
fixed-income position to generate cash, and you can handle a bit of volatility. 
The average maturity of the index is 6.5 years, which means that the value of 
any fund tracking the index will have its ups and downs.
You may need something less volatile, or you may want a fund that provides 
either a higher potential return or tax-free interest payments. Such fine-
tuning of your bond portfolio is the subject of Chapter 8. There, you’ll find 
suggestions for many bond index funds that track, in many cases, Lehman 
Brothers indexes of various sorts.
MSCI Barra
The “MS” in MSCI stands for Morgan Stanley, and the investment banking 
house is a majority shareholder in this firm, which is famous for, among 
other things, its global indexes.
MSCI produces indexes that track the performance of both stock and bond 
markets in nearly every nation on Earth, including 23 developed markets 
(England, France, Japan), 25 emerging markets (Russia, Brazil, India), and 20 
of what the MSCI folks call frontier markets (Kenya, Croatia, Sri Lanka).

89
 Chapter 6: The Basic Index Investing Components
A good portion of non-U.S. ETFs, including most of those issued by industry 
leaders Barclays and Vanguard, track MSCI global indexes. Vanguard also 
uses MSCI indexes for many of its domestic equity funds, both ETFs and 
mutual funds.
What makes for a superior index?
All indexes are not created equal. Where it 
comes to investing — and picking an index 
upon which to base an investment strategy — 
the following are signs that the index you’ve 
chosen to track is a winner or a loser:
What securities are included in the index?
 ✓ Winners: Inclusion of securities in the index 
is determined by an objective means, and 
that means is clearly spelled out and based 
on a crisp set of criteria that all can see.
 ✓ Losers: Securities in the index are chosen 
by men in funny hats who read tea leaves 
and use tarot cards.
What are the securities chosen meant to 
represent?
 ✓ Winners: The securities represent an entire 
market, or a good chunk of a market that 
may be defined as an asset class. In other 
words, the basket of securities has certain 
characteristics that set it apart from any-
thing else in your portfolio. Examples may 
include large cap growth stocks, real estate 
investment trusts, or commodities.
 ✓ Losers: The securities represent a tiny 
sliver of the market or have no real distin-
guishing characteristic that sets them apart 
from any other investments you may hold. 
Examples may include all companies whose 
CEO is named Fred or companies that issue 
dividends on the second Tuesday of each 
month.
How often does the index change?
 ✓ Winners: Updated at least annually to 
reflect changes in the market. But not 
updated so often as to create unnecessary 
turnover leading to excess expenses and 
negative tax consequences.
 ✓ Losers: Updated when the men in funny 
hats feel like it.
What kind of weighting method is used?
 ✓ Winners: It’s generally best that the index 
is cap-weighted according to the investible 
portion of companies (float-weighted) — 
but there may be exceptions.
 ✓ Losers: Weighted by some seemingly 
random or fleeting element, such as the 
price of the stock or the astrological sign of 
the CEO.
If the index is tilted to juice investment returns, 
just how is it tilted?
 ✓ Winners: The index uses long-term historical 
data to find market segments that outper-
form. Example: A broad stock market index 
that tilts toward value (bargain-basement) 
stocks.
 ✓ Losers: The index uses very recent market 
performance to concentrate on whatever 
happens to be hot at the moment. Example: 
A stock market index that tilts toward com-
panies that are making money off national 
security initiatives.

90
Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
MSCI indexes are cap-weighted, but they purposely allow for ample fudge 
room before bumping a company from one category and moving it into 
another. This results in instances in which you may occasionally find, say, a 
mid cap company in a large cap index. You may also find certain companies 
whose stock appears in both a value index and a growth index.
The downside to this methodology is that you wind up with somewhat nebu-
lous indexes with possible crossover. The upside is that the indexes neces-
sitate limited turnover, which can reduce trading costs and taxes to those 
who invest in funds that track MSCI indexes. (Hey, no index is perfect; they 
all have pros and cons.)
Russell’s review
 
Provided the fund management fees are low, funds based on MSCI indexes 
should be considered gems, although not necessarily Hope diamonds. In 
Chapter 7 where I outline my suggestions for specific stock ETFs and index 
mutual funds, you’ll find that many MSCI index–based funds make it to the top 
of the list.
Russell
Although they don’t have the same household familiarity as either Standard 
& Poor’s or Dow Jones, the Russell indexes are where most financial profes-
sionals look to measure the performance of the broad U.S. stock market.
Although Russell produces dozens of global indexes — with a particular 
emphasis on Japan (the Russell/Nomura indexes) — this index provider is 
best known for its U.S. indexes, especially the Russell 3000, the Russell 1000, 
and the Russell 2000. Here is how they work:
Each year, on May 31, the folks at Russell rank U.S. common stocks from larg-
est to smallest, using market capitalization but on a strictly free-float basis. 
(They ignore all stocks held in private hands that are very unlikely to be 
bought or sold anytime soon.) After they’ve calculated the entire list, they 
divide it up as follows:
 
✓ The broad market: The largest 3,000 stocks become the Russell 3000 
Index.
 
✓ The large cap and mid cap market: Within the broad market, the top 
one-third — the largest 1,000 stocks — become the Russell 1000 Index.
 
✓ The small cap market: The remaining two-thirds of stocks become the 
Russell 2000 Index.

91
 Chapter 6: The Basic Index Investing Components
Within each of these size categories, Russell further breaks up the world of 
stocks into value and growth, and the methodology it uses to do so (largely 
price-to-book ratio) makes eminent sense, even though it has been attacked 
of late for being old-fashioned.
Many ETFs, including a good number of Barclays iShares domestic stock 
ETFs, use the Russell indexes as their foundation.
Russell’s review
There is good rhyme and reason behind Russell’s lineup of indexes. (Plus, 
the name is excellent, don’t you think?) As I tend to like broad indexes on 
which to base investments, I naturally lean toward Russell as a solid base for 
any index funds chosen for a portfolio. Russell indexes, especially when com-
bined with the prowess of Barclays at producing index investment products, 
make for especially smart portfolio choices.
Getting to Know Some of 
the Secondary Teams
The minor leagues of indexing is where you are most likely to find things 
done in a nontraditional manner. Hold onto your hats as I introduce you to 
some players in the field you many not be familiar with. The following outfits 
produce indexes that have a substantial number of funds tracking them, so 
you should familiarize yourself with their names and basic styles. In the fol-
lowing several chapters, I may recommend either ETFs or index mutual funds 
that use their indexes.
FTSE
FTSE is to the United Kingdom what Standard & Poor’s is to the United 
States. It is an independent company owned by the Financial Times and the 
London Stock Exchange. Its flagship index, the FTSE 100, is often used to 
represent the British stock market, much as the S&P 500 represents the U.S. 
stock market. But just as S&P produces many indexes aside from the S&P 
500, so does FTSE produce many indexes aside from the famous FTSE 100. In 
fact, it produces more than 100,000 indexes covering all sorts of asset classes 
in nearly every country of the world.

92
Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
In the United States, FTSE has become a leader in the production of funda-
mental indexes: indexes that use various financial criteria to build investment 
portfolios designed to (they hope) outperform conventional indexes. For 
example, FTSE produces a host of industry-sector indexes (utilities, health-
care, consumer services, and so on) in which the companies included, and 
their weights in the index, are chosen by their book values, income, sales, 
and dividends.
Several purveyors of ETFs — most notably PowerShares and Vanguard — 
have chosen to base a number of index investment products on FTSE indexes.
Morningstar
From the company most famous for its independent analysis — and star 
ratings — of stocks and stock funds, Morningstar indexes cover everything 
from the broad stock market to small market sectors, as well as bonds and 
commodities.
Perhaps most particular to Morningstar indexes is the strong emphasis on 
style investing. You may be familiar with the Morningstar “grid” that breaks 
the universe of stocks into large, mid cap, and small stocks, as well as value, 
blend, and growth stocks. Many financial professionals, including the hand-
some guy writing this book, like to look at their portfolios in terms of the 
Morningstar grid. We therefore tend to like indexes that (in the words of 
Morningstar) “can be used for precise asset allocation and benchmarking, 
and as efficient tools for portfolio construction and market analysis.”
Barclays iShares issues a series of ETFs based on Morningstar indexes. 
They’ve been around for several years but have not become enormously 
popular. Nonetheless, they are among the better ETFs you can buy, in terms 
of both following a highly reasonable index and carrying low management 
expenses.
Dimensional
Dimensional Fund Advisors, also called DFA, has been around since 1981 
and has become an undisputed leader in index investing. The name isn’t 
nearly as well-known as Vanguard’s because Dimensional sells its funds only 
to institutions and fee-only (non-commissioned) wealth managers. I myself 
use Dimensional, in addition to Vanguard index funds and various ETFs. 
Dimensional produces its own indexes and does so brilliantly.

93
 Chapter 6: The Basic Index Investing Components
 
Here’s what’s unique about Dimensional: The firm embraces years of aca-
demic research that tell us certain kinds of stocks and bonds tend to show 
higher performance per unit of risk. Most notably, value stocks — stocks that 
sell at low prices compared to the innate value of the company — tend to kick 
butt over time. Small cap and microcap stocks similarly tend to yield higher 
returns per unit of risk than do large cap stocks. Based on this research, 
Dimensional’s indexes, even those that measure broad markets, tend to lean 
toward small cap and value.
This is something very few other producers of indexes seem to grasp or, even 
if they do, orchestrate as well as Dimensional.
On the bond side of things, Dimensional’s quasi index-based funds scour the 
developed fixed-income world looking for the highest yields. It’s a unique 
approach that has served Dimensional’s investors well.
The only problem with Dimensional is that the fund expenses, while reason-
able, are still considerably higher than some other index products on the 
market. And if you have to work through a fee-only advisor, that, too, will add 
to your expenses. Together, it means that Dimensional products, although 
excellent, are not a slam-dunk for your portfolio.
I weigh in more on Dimensional index funds in Chapter 7.
WisdomTree
Under the tutelage of investment gurus Jeremy Siegel (author of Stocks for the 
Long Run and esteemed professor at Wharton) and Michael Steinhardt (former 
hedge-fund king), an upstart company named WisdomTree is producing ETFs 
and the indexes behind them. WisdomTree’s propriety indexes are weighted 
according to both company earnings and the issuance of dividends. In essence, 
the company is taking a crack at redefining value stocks using a new method-
ology to pick them. Instead of using the traditional book-to-value and price-
earnings ratios used by most financial types, WisdomTree is looking more at a 
company’s profitability and trends in cash disbursements to shareholders.
Will the newer methodology bring better returns for investors? Only time will 
tell. Seigel and Steinhardt are very smart guys, for sure. But there are also finan-
cial powerhouses who still swear by more traditional methods of indexing.
If all else were equal, I’d be quite keen on WisdomTree ETFs. But because 
they tend to carry slightly higher costs than other ETFs, they also carry a risk 
that should the new methodology not prove clearly superior, investors could 
lose out. Time will be the judge.

Chapter 7
Investing in Stock Indexes: 
Your Gateway to Growth
In This Chapter
▶ Recognizing the importance of stocks in your portfolio
▶ Appreciating that not all stocks — or stock indexes — are the same
▶ Achieving diversification in your equity portfolio
▶ Understanding the basics of style investing
▶ Choosing the best index funds for your stock holdings
▶ Knowing what options are best to avoid
Yes, the heading to this chapter is 100 percent on the mark — stocks 
are indeed your “gateway to growth.” BUT, hey (you already know this, 
I’m sure, but a reminder won’t hurt), the gate swings both ways. Invest in the 
wrong stocks, or invest at the wrong time, and your nest egg can get seri-
ously scrambled.
Just ask grandma and grandpa about that little picnic called the Great 
Depression. Or ask anyone who was invested in stocks during the much more 
recent three-year bear market of 2000–2002. Or look at your own portfolio’s 
less-than-anything-to-write-home-about performance in even more recent 
days. (I write this three-quarters of the way through 2008, when the S&P 500 
is down more than 11 percent year-to-date.)
Indeed, the gate swings both ways, and if you aren’t careful, it can knock you 
on your financial butt.
 
Index investing can’t protect you entirely from market downturns. If you are 
invested in stocks — any stocks — most bear markets will still leave teeth 
marks in your portfolio. But investing in stock index funds can greatly lessen 
the severity of the bites. And by investing wisely in stock index funds along 
with, say, bond index funds (see Chapter 8) and commodity index funds (see 
Chapter 9), you can sometimes turn bear bites into cub bites.

96
Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
Diversification, you see, is one very important way to lessen the inherent risk 
in a portfolio that has a lot of stock. (Any portfolio poised for growth should 
have lots of stock.) And there is no better way to achieve diversification than 
through index funds.
In this chapter, I focus on stock index funds (which comprise about 90 percent of 
all index funds) and discuss the many options — good, great, and not-so-great — 
available to you.
Understanding the Whys and 
Wherefores of Stock Investing
Stocks go up. Stocks go down. But over the long run — sometimes you may 
need to wait till the very long run! — they go up. That’s why you want stocks 
in your portfolio. If you can stomach the inevitable volatility, you want pre-
dominately stocks. (See recommended percentages in Chapters 11 and 15.)
Stocks are nothing magic. They are little more than certificates (real paper-
and-ink certificates in the old days, virtual certificates today) that verify you 
are a partial owner in a company. As a partial owner, you are due a portion 
of any dividends issued by the company. You are also due to share in any 
increase in the price of the company’s stock. A stock’s price may increase 
because the company itself becomes more valuable (as evidenced by sales 
and profits and patents and such), or it may increase simply because the 
market suddenly thinks the stock should be worth more, whether sales and 
profits are going up or not.
Of course, if the company starts to lose money or goes under, or the market 
simply loses faith in a stock, the dividend payments will dry up faster than a 
sponge in the microwave, and the value of your holdings (the price of your 
shares) will drop.
Distinguishing individual stocks 
from stocks in the aggregate
An individual company stock — even for a company as large and powerful 
as McDonald’s or Coca-Cola — is subject to the whims of the market. That 
includes the market for burgers and soda, as well as the stock market itself.

97
 Chapter 7: Investing in Stock Indexes: Your Gateway to Growth
But in the aggregate, stocks are much less subject to whims. As long as the 
economy at large is doing well, most company stocks will do well. That’s 
because industry is the largest component in our economy.
To put it in other words, if you invest in a large basket of stocks, you will very 
likely see good return on your capital as long as capitalism is thriving. That’s 
not to say that capitalism will thrive forever. It won’t. Sooner or later, the sun 
will explode, taking even McDonald’s and Coca-Cola with it. But the current 
economic system, despite many problems, doesn’t seem on the verge of col-
lapse. (One of the tips I provide later on — in Chapter 16 — is to tune out the 
mass media coverage of the markets, which is forever forecasting imminent 
collapse.)
We invest in stocks because stocks have a long history of superlative perfor-
mance, and we assume that the future may look something like the past. And, 
despite what we may hear on CNN, scientists tell us that we have about 5 bil-
lion more years until the sun explodes.
Separating the two kinds of risk
The risk you take investing in stocks comes in two varieties. When you invest 
in an individual stock, say McDonald’s, you risk that the company itself will 
be hurt either by something it does wrong or something beyond its control 
that nonetheless crushes its stock. The company may offer a new product 
or product line (lizard burgers, for example) that the public simply hates. Or 
the CEO may have a heart attack (from eating too many lizard burgers with 
fries). Or there may be an expensive lawsuit brought by a rival company or 
an angry supplier or customer (who choked on a lizard bone). This kind of 
risk is known as nonsystemic risk.
The other kind of risk — the systemic version — is the risk that the entire 
economy will falter or that stock valuations will plummet simply because the 
public at large (after watching too much CNN) gets cold feet and decides to 
shove all its investment dollars under the mattress (or put it into Treasury 
bonds and CDs). This kind of risk is much more dangerous to investors.
 
Investing in stock indexes wipes nonsystemic risk off the map. When you are 
an index investor, you free yourself from the stupidity of individual CEOs and 
the vicissitudes of a fickle investing public that may like a certain stock one 
day and not the next.
Unfortunately, index investing can’t do a whole lot to eliminate systemic risk.

98
Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
But here’s the good news: Over the long run, you get compensated for sys-
temic risk. Investing in a high-risk market (like small cap stocks or emerging-
market stocks) has historically paid off very handsomely.
Investing in less risky markets, like blue chip stocks, has paid off hand-
somely, but less so. The higher the risk, the higher the return — as long 
as we’re talking about systemic risk! Nonsystemic risk, on the other hand, 
brings no concurrent reward. None. Zip. Nada.
If McDonald’s brings out a lizard burger, and you hold McDonald’s stock, you 
lose. There is no up side.
By investing in index funds and eliminating nonsystemic risk, you essentially 
increase your anticipated return per unit of risk. And that’s a very good thing! 
That’s one of many reasons that indexing makes such a sweet investment 
strategy.
Appreciating past performance
In Figure 7-1, I present a bird’s-eye view of how stocks of large companies 
and small companies have performed in the past 20+ years. What’s shown 
here are the rolling 36-month returns of two stocks indexes: the Russell 2000 
(small stocks) and the S&P 500 (large stocks). As a point of comparison, I 
also show you how well bonds — the obvious alternative to stocks — have 
done in the same time period. (Chapter 8 talks all about bond indexes.)
 
Keep in mind that history is history. Just because stocks have seen an average 
annual return of about 10 percent over the past 80 or so years is no guarantee 
that they will do so in the future. We simply don’t know.
Taking a cautionary approach
Note that such long-term charts as Figure 7-1 — I’m sure you’ve seen similar 
charts before — can be a wee bit misleading, giving you something of a false 
sense of security. Few people can invest their money for 20+ years. Many of 
us build sizeable nest eggs by the time we’re, say, 55 or so, and then hope 
to head to retirement within, say, the next 10 years. If we’re only a few years 
away from retirement, swings in the stock market can make or break us.
For that reason, investing in stocks, in the eyes of most financial types, is a 
no-brainer for the young who have lots of time to see their investments grow 
(or to replace those investments should they go poof). For older investors, 
mixing stocks with other, more conservative investments is the way to go. I 
talk about this subject more in Chapter 11 and then provide sample portfo-
lios in Chapter 15.

For the remainder of this chapter, I want to focus in on your choices in 
stocks, and stocks alone.
Investing in Stocks the Right Way
Within the world of stock investing, there are ways to invest brilliantly and 
ways to invest dumbly. I’ve seen both.
Here are some general guidelines for intelligent and profitable stock invest-
ing. Note that choosing stock index funds will help you achieve many of these 
guidelines!
 
✓ Be in it for the long haul. You don’t know where the value of your 
investment will be in one, two, or three years. Stock markets are volatile. 
Only invest money in stocks that you aren’t going to need for at least 
several years to come.
 
✓ Don’t tinker too much. Buying and selling stock can be expensive, with 
commissions and spreads (the difference between the ask and buy price) 
eating into your profits, and taxes eating up whatever is left. Resist the 
urge to day-trade, or anything close to it. Buying and holding saves 
money, and a penny saved is . . . you know.

100
Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
 
✓ Watch what you pay the experts. Mutual funds are great ways to own 
stocks. So are exchange-traded funds. And sometimes, having a profes-
sional broker or financial planner to guide you can be very helpful. But 
always watch your bottom line. Fund management fees and advisor costs 
should be scrutinized. Are you really getting what you’re paying for?
 
✓ Diversify to the hilt. At a minimum, you should have a good mix of U.S. 
and international stocks. Preferably, you should not only have a global 
mix, but you should also have large-company and small-company stocks, 
and value and growth stocks. And your stocks should be spread among 
various industries.
 
✓ Be tax conscious. Use tax-advantaged accounts, such as 401(k)s and 
IRAs, to stash whatever assets you can. Stocks that throw off lots of 
dividend income or stocks that can be expected to appreciate greatly 
can profit you a lot more if Uncle Sam’s hands can be kept away. Certain 
kinds of stocks — such as real estate investment trusts (REITs) — are 
notoriously tax-inefficient and should always be kept in tax-advantaged 
accounts.
 
✓ Be risk-appropriate. All stocks are potentially volatile and offer a crack 
at appreciation. Some stocks, however, are riskier (more volatile) and 
allow for greater growth. Know one kind of stock from another, and 
know what your personal level of risk should be. Generally, stocks in 
smaller companies and less advanced countries offer greater potential 
for return and the highest odds of taking a belly flop.
 
✓ Achieve balance in your portfolio. Know that even an optimally diversi-
fied stock portfolio will still carry risk. Few, if any, investors should have 
everything in stocks. Seek to balance your stock portfolio with bonds, 
commodities, and cash.
 
✓ Buy low, sell high! One of the biggest mistakes that investors make is 
bailing out of stocks when the going gets rough, then loading back up on 
the stocks when the going is grand. You don’t want to do that! Be better 
disciplined. If you feel that your portfolio deserves, say, a 60 percent 
allocation to stocks, get it there, and keep it there. Yes, that may mean 
buying more stock just when others are selling, and selling when others 
are buying. You’ll clobber those others’ returns over the long run!
 
✓ Buy and hold, but don’t ignore. Set yourself up with a solid portfolio 
strategy, but don’t forget to revisit it from time to time. You’ll be getting 
older, your income will change, your expenses may vary, your domestic 
situation may change . . . All of these factors can warrant a tweaking of 
your original plans.

101
 Chapter 7: Investing in Stock Indexes: Your Gateway to Growth
Choosing Wisely among Many 
Stock Index Funds
Your choice of stock index funds is enormous — and growing. (A select list 
of index mutual funds appears in Appendix A, and a select list of exchange-
traded funds appears in Appendix B.) If I were to review every single index 
fund, this book would run over 1,000 pages! In the following sections, I review 
only some of my very favorite stock index funds (and give dishonorable men-
tion to a few of my least favorite).
Note that there is no such thing as a “perfect” index or index fund. I try to 
give you a good idea of what comes close to perfect in this chapter, but much 
depends on your personal circumstances. I get into all that personal stuff — 
your investment style, your risk tolerance, your tax bracket, your career, 
your age, and so on — in Part III.
Home of the brave: Broad U.S. 
stock market index funds
For most investors living, working, and spending their hard-earned cash in 
the United States, taking a somewhat sizeable stake in the U.S. stock market 
makes enormous sense. A healthy financial exposure to the largest economy 
on the planet makes sense even in the portfolio of a Brit or a Japanese. And 
to a U.S. citizen, it makes even more sense. That’s because high inflation 
and stock market performance are somewhat correlated. If inflation zooms, 
chances are good (but not guaranteed) that the stock market will zoom, and 
your portfolio will protect you from poverty.
How much do you want to invest in the broad U.S. stock market? It currently 
represents 38 percent of the global stock market. I recommend that your 
total stock position be somewhere in the ballpark of 50 to 60 percent U.S. 
stocks. You want at least 40 percent international stock to diversify your 
portfolio. Even though most U.S. investors have recently poured money into 
foreign stocks (for all the wrong reasons — they were chasing recent perfor-
mance), most of them still could stand to have more invested abroad.
As for the 50 to 60 percent of your portfolio that you want in U.S. stock, 
it may belong in a broad-market index fund. For modest stock portfolios 
($20,000 or under), a single broad-index U.S. fund combined with a single 

102
Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
broad-index international fund is often the best route to go. Many mutual 
funds have minimum investments of $2,500 or so, but some of the best, unfor-
tunately, have minimums of $10,000. If you go with an exchange-traded fund, 
there will never be a minimum, but trading costs can add appreciably to your 
total investment costs if you try to split less than $20,000 too many ways.
Following are some broad U.S. stock market index funds worthy of 
consideration.
Mutual funds
Fidelity Spartan Total Market Index Fund (FSTMX)
Indexed to: Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 Index. The fund holds about 3,370 of the 
5,400 stocks in the index.
Expense ratio: 0.10 percent
Average cap size: $28.0 billion
P/E ratio: 15.8
Minimum initial purchase: $10,000
Minimum initial purchase in IRA: $10,000
Top five holdings: Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Microsoft, AT&T, Procter & 
Gamble
Notes: This fund tracks a very broad index (that’s good!) and is a true low-cost 
leader among index funds. If you can amass $100,000, you can then move the 
money to the Fidelity Spartan Total Market Advantage Class version — the 
very same fund, but with an absolute rock-bottom industry fee of 0.07 percent 
a year. Fidelity, I believe, has lowered the prices on a few of its broad index 
market funds for the main purpose of taking away index customers from

Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSMX)
Indexed to: The MSCI U.S. Broad Market Index, which captures 99.5 percent 
of the value of all the publicly traded stock in the United States. The fund 
typically holds the largest 1,200 to 1,300 stocks in its target index (covering 
nearly 95 percent of the MSCI index’s total market capitalization) and a repre-
sentative sampling of the remaining stocks.

Expense ratio: 0.15 percent
Average cap size: $34.5 billion
P/E ratio: 16.9
Minimum initial purchase: $3,000
Minimum initial purchase in IRA: $3,000
Top five holdings: Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Microsoft, AT&T, Procter & 
Gamble
Notes: If you qualify for Vanguard Admiral Shares, you can have this very 
same fund for a total of 0.07 percent a year, the lowest in the business (on 
a par with Fidelity). You qualify for the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index 
Fund Admiral Shares (VTSAX) if you have $100,000 or more invested in the 
fund, or if you’ve owned the fund for at least 10 years and have a balance of 
$50,000 or more. Alternatively, you can buy the same fund in ETF version, pay 
0.07 percent, and not have to have any minimum amount invested (although 
you will pay a trading fee).
T. Rowe Price Total Equity Market Index Fund (POMIX)
Indexed to: The S&P Total Market Index, which boasts a lineup of roughly 
4,500 stocks, cap-weighted.
Expense ratio: 0.40 percent
Average cap size: $31.1 billion
P/E ratio: 16.7
Minimum initial purchase: $2,500
Minimum initial purchase in IRA: $1,000
Top five holdings: AT & T, Bank of America, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, General 
Electric
Notes: This is a very similar fund to both the Vanguard and Fidelity options. 
Note the higher expense ratio but the lower minimum investment. T. Rowe 
Price has a tradition of being friendlier than most large brokerage houses to 
the smaller investor.

Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)
Indexed to: The MSCI U.S. Broad Market Index, which captures 99.5 percent 
of the value of all the publicly traded stock in the United States. The fund 
typically holds the largest 1,200 to 1,300 stocks in its target index (covering 
nearly 95 percent of the MSCI index’s total market capitalization) and a repre-
sentative sample of the remaining stocks.
Expense ratio: 0.07 percent
Average cap size: $31.0 billion
P/E ratio: 16.7
Top five holdings: Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Microsoft, AT&T, Procter & 
Gamble
Notes: This is the ETF version of Vanguard’s Total Stock Market Index Fund. 
At 0.07 percent (versus about twice as much for the mutual fund), the ETF 
is clearly a better way to go for most folks. Of all the total-market funds in 
the business, this will be the optimal choice for many investors, both for 
its breadth of investments and its super-low cost . . . not to mention a high 
degree of tax-efficiency.
SPDR DJ Wilshire Total Market ETF (TMW)
Indexed to: The Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 Index. The fund holds about 1,020 
of the 5,400 stocks in the index.
Expense ratio: 0.20 percent
Average cap size: $30.6 billion
P/E ratio: 13.8
Top five holdings: Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Microsoft, AT&T, Procter & 
Gamble
Notes: This is essentially the same fund as the Fidelity Spartan Total Market 
Index Fund (FSTMX) — but at exactly twice the cost. I sometimes use this fund 
as an example to illustrate that ETFs aren’t always cheaper than mutual funds. 
Of course, this ETF doesn’t carry a $10,000 minimum, as does the Fidelity 
mutual fund. It may also prove to be slightly more tax-efficient over time.

 Chapter 7: Investing in Stock Indexes: Your Gateway to Growth
iShares Dow Jones U.S. Total Market (IYY)
Indexed to: The Dow Jones U.S. Index, which aims to represent the top 95 
percent of U.S. companies based on float-adjusted market capitalization, 
excluding the very smallest and least-liquid stocks. IYY consists of approxi-
mately 1,500 stocks used as a representative sampling.
Expense ratio: 0.20 percent
Average cap size: $32.3 billion
P/E ratio: 19.8
Top five holdings: Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Microsoft, AT&T, Procter & 
Gamble
Notes: ETF industry leader Barclays iShares knows how to produce index 
funds, and this is indeed a well-greased product, on a par with the similar 
SPDR ETF (TMW) in terms of both breadth and expense ratio. Both of these 
securities, however, exceed Vanguard’s ETF (VTI) and Fidelity’s index mutual 
fund (FSTMX) in cost, and I doubt you will get any extra juice for your money.
What does the P/E ratio mean?
We financial people just love ratios, and per-
haps no ratio is as often quoted as the P/E, 
which is short for Price/Earnings.
To get the P/E, you start with the company’s 
total earnings over the past year, and divide 
that number by the total number of shares of 
stock issued by the company. The resulting 
figure represents earnings per share, repre-
sented by the letter E. The upper number of the 
equation — P — represents the market price 
of the stock. When a P/E is applied to a fund, it 
represents the aggregate of all the P’s and all 
the E’s in the fund portfolio.
Generally speaking, the lower the ratio (the 
higher the earnings in relation to the price of 
the stock), the more “valuey” a stock or a port-
folio. That’s often a good thing because valuey 
stocks and portfolios, over the course of history, 
all things being equal, tend to appreciate more 
over time. Growth stocks and growth funds typi-
cally have higher P/E ratios than value stocks 
and funds. (In fact, “growth” and “value” are 
often defined by the P/E ratios.) For a well-
diversified portfolio, you want both.

Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
Microsoft and McDonald’s: Large 
cap U.S. stock index funds
Big and beefy, U.S. large cap stocks (the term generally refers to stocks of 
companies worth at least $5 billion) are the single biggest component in most 
people’s portfolios. If your total stock portfolio is over $20,000 or so, and the 
total amount you have allocated to U.S. stock is above $10,000 or so, I recom-
mend that you consider splitting your domestic holdings into large cap and 
small cap, rather than dumping everything into a total market fund.
Why?
By splitting your holdings, you gain the ability to rebalance your portfolio 
every year or so. (I explain rebalancing in Chapter 16.) And by doing that —
 by adding to down positions and drawing from up positions — you can 
perhaps juice some added return from your portfolio. As your portfolio gets 
larger, you may want to slice and dice your domestic stock holdings into sev-
eral categories, but for a start, large cap and small cap work quite nicely.
Large cap stocks tend to do better in certain times (remember the 1990s?). 
Small caps tend to perform better in the long haul, but with considerably 
more volatility. I suggest proper proportions of each in Chapters 12 and 15. 
Here, I present some of the large cap funds most worthy of consideration.
Mutual funds
Vanguard Large Cap Index Fund (VLACX)
Indexed to: The MSCI U.S. Prime Market 750 Index, a diversified index of 
stocks of the most humungous U.S. companies, both value and growth.
Expense ratio: 0.20 percent
Average cap size: $47.5 billion
P/E ratio: 16.6
Minimum initial purchase: $3,000
Minimum initial purchase in IRA: $3,000
Top five holdings: Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Microsoft, AT&T, Procter & 
Gamble

107
 Chapter 7: Investing in Stock Indexes: Your Gateway to Growth
Notes: With $100,000, you can move to the Admiral Class of this fund 
(VLCAX) — the very same beast but with a yearly fee of only 0.12 percent. Or, 
if you want the ETF version of the same fund, you can purchase the Vanguard 
Large Cap ETF (VV), which has an expense ratio of only 0.07 percent.
Fidelity 100 Index Fund (FOHIX)
Indexed to: The S&P 100 Index, which is a subset of the S&P 500. (Would you 
believe that the 100 largest stocks in the S&P 500 constitute 60 percent of the 
S&P 500 and 45 percent of the capitalization of the entire U.S. stock market?!)
Expense ratio: 0.20 percent
Average cap size: $105.1 billion
P/E ratio: 15.3
Minimum initial purchase: $10,000
Minimum initial purchase in IRA: $10,000
Top five holdings: Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Microsoft, AT&T, Procter & 
Gamble
Notes: The Fidelity Spartan 500 Index Fund (FSMKX) is more popular and 
cheaper (0.10 percent annual management fee), but if you want a large cap 
fund that is truly large, the Fidelity 100 is the way to go. At 0.20 percent, the 
fee is reasonable, and this fund gives you excellent diversification if matched 
with a small cap index fund.
Exchange-traded funds
Rydex Russell Top 50 ETF (XLG)
Indexed to: The Russell Top 50 Index, which includes approximately 50 of 
the largest companies in the land.
Expense ratio: 0.20 percent
Average cap size: $139.8 billion
P/E ratio: 15.3
Top five holdings: Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Microsoft, AT&T, Procter & 
Gamble

108
Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
Notes: If you want BIG — really BIG — this is the fund to choose. The expense 
ratio is fine. The Russell indexes are well constructed. There’s nothing to lose 
here — unless large caps get clobbered.
Vanguard Large Cap ETF (VV)
Indexed to: The MSCI U.S. Prime Market 750 Index, a diversified index of 
stocks of the most humungous U.S. companies, both value and growth.
Expense ratio: 0.07 percent
Average cap size: $47.5 billion
P/E ratio: 16.6
Top five holdings: Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Microsoft, AT&T, Procter & 
Gamble
Notes: This is the ETF version of Vanguard’s Large Cap Index Fund (VLACX). 
The ETF has a considerably lower management fee, but, of course, you have 
to pay a commission to buy and trade it. Like all ETFs, there is no minimum 
investment.
iShares S&P 100 Index Fund (OEF)
Indexed to: The S&P 100 Index, which is a subset of the S&P 500.
Expense ratio: 0.20 percent
Average cap size: $104.9 billion
P/E ratio: 15.3
Top five holdings: Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Microsoft, AT&T, Procter & 
Gamble
Notes: This Barclays product is essentially the ETF version of the Fidelity 
100 Index Fund (FOHIX) — same expense ratio and everything. Which is the 
better bet? There isn’t going to be much difference, really. If you have the 
$10,000 to invest in the mutual fund, and you already have your money parked 
at Fidelity, I’d say it’s going to be pretty much a wash. If you have less than 
$10,000 to invest, or if you’re using another brokerage house (which will prob-
ably charge more for the Fidelity mutual fund than the ETF), go with the ETF.

109
 Chapter 7: Investing in Stock Indexes: Your Gateway to Growth
Small is beautiful: Small cap 
and micro cap index funds
 
In the parlance of Wall Street, small cap stocks are stocks in companies worth 
$250 million to $1 billion, and micro cap stocks are with companies valued at 
$50 million to $250 million. (Compare these figures to large caps, which are 
companies with more than $5 billion in capitalization, and mid caps, which are 
everything in between.)
Over time, small cap stocks clearly outperform larger company stocks. 
(Think Microsoft as a young company versus Microsoft today.) According 
to the latest figures from Morningstar, one dollar invested in large company 
stocks at year-end 1925 would have grown by now to $3,250. One dollar 
invested in small company stocks would have grown by now to $15,100. That 
equates to an average compound annual return of 10.4 for the large stocks 
and 12.5 for the small stocks.
Small stocks are also more volatile than large stocks. If you’re familiar with 
standard deviation, the most popular way that volatility is measured, large 
company stocks have a long-term standard deviation, per Morningstar, of 
20.0 percent versus 32.6 percent for small company stocks.
It pays to have both large company and small company stocks in your port-
folio because they tend to do better (or worse) at different times. A perfect 
example comes from the dot-com explosion of the 1990s, when large cap 
stocks were flying high, versus just a few years later, when small caps raged 
ahead. Note the dramatic difference in compound annual return between 
these two five-year periods:
1994–1998
2000–2004
Large company stocks
24.06
–2.30
Small company stocks
13.16
14.32

Following are a few small company stock index funds well worth your

Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
Mutual funds
Vanguard Small Cap Index Fund (NAESX)
Indexed to: The MSCI U.S. Small Cap 1750 Index, which represents the 
universe of small cap companies in the U.S. market. The index targets for 
inclusion 1,750 companies (sometimes it may be slightly more or less) and 
represents about 12 percent of the capitalization of the U.S. stock market.
Expense ratio: 0.23 percent
Average cap size: $1.5 billion
P/E ratio: 17.8
Minimum initial purchase: $3,000
Minimum initial purchase in IRA: $3,000
Top five holdings: CF Industries, Flowserve, Respironics, BE Aerospace, 
Terra Industries
Notes: This is a good all-around small cap index fund, although it isn’t as small 
cap as it could be. With $100,000 invested, you can move to the Vanguard 
Admiral Shares version of this fund (VSMAX) and pay only 0.13 percent a year 
in operating fees. Or, you can choose the ETF version (VB) and spend only 
0.10 percent.
Bridgeway Ultra-Small Company Market Fund (BRSIX)
Indexed to: The CRSP 10 index. The fund uses approximately 550 stocks to 
closely — but not exactly — mirror the performance of the CRSP 10, which is 
the smallest of the smallest of publicly traded companies. CRSP, by the way, 
stands for The Center for Research in Security Prices, which is associated 
with the University of Chicago’s Graduate School of Business.
Expense ratio: 0.65 percent
Average cap size: $338 million
P/E ratio: 16.8
Minimum initial purchase: $2,000
Minimum initial purchase in IRA: $2,000

111
 Chapter 7: Investing in Stock Indexes: Your Gateway to Growth
Top five holdings: iShares Russell 2000 Index ETF, iShares Russell 2000 Value 
Index ETF, Amedisys, Twin Disc, Hurco Companies
Notes: This is a quasi-index mutual fund, but that’s about all you’re going 
to find in the arena of very small-company mutual funds. That’s okay. 
Bridgeway’s reasonable costs (compared to some other managed small cap 
mutual funds) and index-like approach make this a good — although not 
great — choice for small cap exposure.
Exchange-traded funds
Vanguard Small Cap ETF (VB)
Indexed to: The MSCI U.S. Small Cap 1750 Index, which represents the 
universe of small cap companies in the U.S. market. The index targets for 
inclusion 1,750 companies (sometimes it may be slightly more or less) and 
represents about 12 percent of the capitalization of the U.S. stock market.
Expense ratio: 0.10
Average cap size: $1.5 billion
P/E ratio: 17.8
Top five holdings: CF Industries, Flowserve, Respironics, BE Aerospace, 
Terra Industries
Notes: This is the ETF version of Vanguard’s Small Cap Index (mutual) Fund. 
The low fee on this ETF makes it a very serious contender for best of the 
bunch if you’re going with an ETF portfolio and want exposure to small cap 
U.S. stocks. Note, however, that the cap size is considerably larger than some 
other options in this category.
iShares Russell Microcap (IWC)
Indexed to: The Russell Microcap Index, which measures the performance of 
the micro cap segment of the U.S. equity market. It makes up less than 3 per-
cent of the U.S. equity market and includes 1,000 of the smallest securities in 
the small cap Russell 2000 Index.
Expense ratio: 0.60 percent
Average cap size: $327 million
P/E ratio: 16.0

112
Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
Top five holdings: Cepheid, Arena Resources, Concur Technologies, Savient 
Pharmaceuticals, Argo Group International Holdings
Notes: Barclays’ microcap offering is quite a bit more pricey than the 
Vanguard fund (or several other ETF small cap offerings), but if you want 
ultra-small, IWC is the obvious ETF choice. To diversify away from a pre-
dominantly large cap portfolio, the added cost may be worth it. In addition to 
better diversification and probable greater performance than the Vanguard 
fund, you will also, however, undoubtedly see much greater volatility . . . 
HUGE volatility.
C’est bon: Developed world index funds
In recent decades (and my guess would be for decades to come), the total 
return on stocks in the United States and other developed countries has 
been rather similar. Why would it be otherwise? Risk and return, we know 
from years of studying the markets, tend to go hand-in-hand. The economic 
strengths and political environment of the United States, Canada, England, 
France, Japan, and Australia would seem to be roughly on a par.
 
As I discuss more in Part III where I address portfolio allocation, it would be 
nothing short of crazy to have all your eggs in one (national) basket. Non-U.S. 
stocks make up 62 percent of all the world’s stocks. I recommend that about 
half (and no less than 40 percent) of your total stock allocation be non-U.S. (I 
would suggest that 62 percent be non-U.S. except that non-U.S. funds tend to 
charge more, and there is currency fluctuation to be concerned with. As a U.S. 
resident, you also have domestic inflation to contend with. If inflation rages, 
the stock market will generally do well, offering you some protection from 
rising prices.)
Why no mid cap stocks?
You’ll notice that I recommend large cap stock 
funds and small cap stock funds, but no mid 
caps. The reason: You don’t need them. Other 
investment gurus may turn red in the face at 
such a suggestion, but so be it. Mid cap returns 
and risk are, well, midway between large cap 
and small cap. Almost always. So why include 
them in your portfolio? Most large cap and small 
cap funds are somewhat fluid and give you a 
smattering of mid cap anyway. Sector funds — 
like REITs — are predominantly mid cap. You 
don’t need to go out of your way to incorporate 
this middle-of-the-road style into your portfolio. 
Having large and small company stocks will 
give you better diversification. Adding mid cap 
funds generally only complicates matters and 
raises your overall expenses.

113
 Chapter 7: Investing in Stock Indexes: Your Gateway to Growth
International diversification makes enormous sense. As you can see in Table 
7-1, although the long-term return of most Western nations’ stock markets is 
comparable, the differences year-to-year and decade-by-decade can be large. 
And those differences can mean a much, much smoother ride for your entire 
portfolio.

One caveat: Some investors believe in country-picking, akin to stock-picking. 
(ETFs make that easy. You can buy ETFs that mirror the markets of countries 
from Belgium to Chile and Hong Kong to the Netherlands.) But country-
picking, in most instances, is no more successful than stock-picking. There’s 
no way for you to know that the Canadian stock market will do better than 
the Swedish stock market next year. When choosing international index 
funds, think broad. Think regions — Europe, Pacific, emerging markets — 
rather than Austria, Australia, and Brazil.
Mutual funds
Vanguard European Stock Index Fund (VEURX)
Indexed to: The MSCI Europe Index, which is made up of common stocks of

developed nations of the Far Orient and South Pacific. If you qualify, you may 
be able to purchase Vanguard Admiral Shares of this fund (VPADX), which 
carry a management fee of only 0.12 percent — the same as the ETF version

 Chapter 7: Investing in Stock Indexes: Your Gateway to Growth
Notes: This is the ETF version of the Vanguard European Stock Market mutual 
fund (VEURX) . . . only it’s cheaper, and there’s no minimum. As international 
ETFs go, this is one of the least expensive, and it tracks a broad index. Note 
that you are getting no small cap exposure with this fund. Small cap interna-
tional exposure will need to come from elsewhere.
Vanguard Pacific ETF (VPL)
Indexed to: The MSCI Pacific Index, which consists of common stocks of 
large companies located in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and New

Notes: This is the ETF version of the Vanguard Pacific Stock Index mutual 
fund (VPACX) . . . only it’s cheaper, and there’s no minimum. Note that you 
are getting no small cap exposure with this fund. Small cap international 
exposure will need to come from elsewhere.
iShares MSCI EAFE Small Cap (SCZ)
Indexed to: The MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australasia, Far East) Small Cap Index, 
which tracks small capitalization stocks in developed non-U.S. nations. The 
five top countries represented are Japan, the United Kingdom, Australia, 
Germany, and France.
Expense ratio: 0.40 percent
Average cap size: $1.6 billion
P/E ratio: 11.9
Top five holdings: Sagami Railway, Confinimmo, Cairn Energy, Incitec Pivot 
Ltd., Café de Coral Holdings Ltd.
Notes: This offering from Barclays is a very good bet for international small 
cap exposure. Small caps in various nations tend to cater to local markets 
and so have significantly less correlation to each other than do large cap 
company stocks. For example, a modest-sized bank in Toyko that lends Yen 
to businesses only in Japan may be unaffected by even large market tremors 
that may occur in Europe or North America.

A calculated risk: Emerging-market 
stock index funds
Whoooeee . . . Stocks of emerging-market (read: We hope they are emerging-
market) nations can yield high returns, but they can be very volatile. These 
are stocks of companies based in countries like Brazil, Russia, India, and 
China (often called the BRIC nations — these are the largest emerging mar-
kets), as well as Turkey, Chile, Taiwan, and Korea.
You want emerging-market stocks in your portfolio to some limited degree, 
mostly because they tend to have limited correlation to U.S. stocks — less 
correlation than other international stocks.
Mutual funds
Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund (VEIEX)
Indexed to: The MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which is made up of common 
stocks of large companies located in emerging markets around the world. 
The top five nations represented are China, Korea, Brazil, Taiwan, and India.
Expense ratio: 0.37 percent
Average cap size: $20.0 billion
P/E ratio: 18.3
Minimum initial purchase: $3,000
Minimum initial purchase in IRA: $3,000
Top five holdings: OAO Gazprom, China Mobile Ltd., Samsung Electronics, 
América Móvil, Petroleo Brasileiro
Notes: There aren’t many indexed options out there when it comes to invest-
ing in emerging markets. But you don’t need many. This one will do just fine. 
If you’ve got the bucks ($100,000), you can qualify for the Vanguard Admiral 
Shares of this fund (VEMAX), which charges 0.28 percent a year in manage-
ment fees. The ETF version (VWO) charges but 0.25 percent.

Expense ratio: 0.25 percent
Average cap size: $20.0 billion
P/E ratio: 18.3
Top five holdings: OAO Gazprom, China Mobile Ltd., Samsung Electronics, 
América Móvil, Petroleo Brasileiro
Notes: This is the ETF version of the Vanguard Emerging Markets Index 
(VEIEX) mutual fund, one of the only indexed emerging-market mutual funds. 
Among ETFs, there are a few options, but Vanguard’s is at the head of the 
pack (largely for its low cost).
Value and growth: Slicing the 
cake with style funds
When your stock portfolio gets large enough (ballpark $30,000), you may con-
sider breaking up your holdings by style as well as cap size.
By style, financial types are referring to value and growth. Value stocks are 
bargain-basement stocks, usually in slow-growing industries like utilities, 
natural resources, and banking. Growth stocks are often popular and may be 
expensive, and they belong to hot companies usually in glamour industries 
like technology and pharmaceuticals.
Value and growth tend to move in different business cycles, as Table 7-2 
demonstrates.
What the tickers on index funds 
designate (nothing much!)
Perhaps Wall Street lacks creativity, but all 
open-end mutual funds — indexed or not — 
have tickers with five letters, and the last letter 
is always an X. Thus, the Vanguard Emerging 
Markets Index Fund is VEIEX, and the T. Rowe 
Price Total Equity Market is POMIX. Exchange-
traded funds, on the other hand, typically have 
three letters in their tickers. Thus, the iShares 
Russell Microcap ETF is IWC, and the Rydex 
Russell Top 50 ETF is XLG. These three-letter 
ETFs may trade on any exchange. A handful of 
ETFs that trade on the NASDAQ happen to have 
four-letter tickers. The most popular of these is 
the PowerShares QQQ (an ETF that tracks the 
top 100 stocks of the NASDAQ) that uses the 
ticker QQQQ.

Owning both won’t give you the diversification of, say, stocks and bonds, or 
even domestic and international stock. But if you can afford to carry both in 
your portfolio and keep them separate, you should. Not only will you gain 
diversification, but you’ll be able to squeeze out extra return over the long 
run by rebalancing your portfolio every year or two (see Chapter 16).
If you’re going to split up your portfolio into the four major style groups — 
large value, large growth, small value, and small growth — following are some 
good funds to use. Note that you can divide up your domestic holdings into 
value and growth and, although there are fewer options for doing so, you also 
can — and should — divide up your international holdings.
Large value mutual fund
Vanguard Value Index Fund (VIVAX)
Indexed to: The MSCI U.S. Prime Market Value Index, a broadly diversified 
index predominantly made up of value stocks of large U.S. companies. The 
fund holds about 380 stocks.
Expense ratio: 0.23 percent
Average cap size: $57.3 billion
P/E ratio: 13.6
Minimum initial purchase: $3,000
Minimum initial purchase in IRA: $3,000
Top five holdings: Exxon Mobil, AT&T, General Electric, Chevron, Johnson & 
Johnson

Notes: Good P/E ratio, diversified holdings, low price . . . what’s not to like? 
With $100,000 to invest, you can switch to Vanguard Admiral shares (VVIAX) 
and incur only a 0.11 percent annual management fee. Or you can buy the 
ETF version of this fund (VTV), which also carries an annual expense ratio of 
0.11 percent, no minimum investment, and, at least theoretically, perhaps a 
tad more tax efficiency.
Large value exchange-traded funds
Vanguard Value ETF (VTV)
Indexed to: The MSCI U.S. Prime Market Value Index, a broadly diversified 
index predominantly made up of value stocks of large U.S. companies. The 
fund holds about 380 stocks.
Expense ratio: 0.23 percent
Average cap size: $57.3 billion
P/E ratio: 13.6
Top five holdings: Exxon Mobil, AT&T, General Electric, Chevron, Johnson & 
Johnson
Notes: This the ETF version of the Vanguard Value Index mutual fund 
(VIVAX). There’s nothing fancy about this fund. It’s a good, solid, core invest-
ment that fits most people’s portfolios like a glove.
PowerShares FTSE RAFI U.S. 1000 (PRF)
Indexed to: The FTSE RAFI U.S. 1000 Index. The index is designed to track — 
sort of — the performance of the largest U.S. equities, selected based on 
the following four fundamental measures of firm size: book value, cash flow, 
sales, and dividends. PowerShares claims it’s a better way to index.
Expense ratio: 0.76 percent
Average cap size: $34.4 billion
P/E ratio: 14.7
Top five holdings: Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Kraft Foods, Chevron, 
Wal-Mart
Notes: The FTSE RAFI methodology presents a new, comprehensive way of 
looking for value in stocks. Will it prove lucrative in the long run — lucrative 
enough to overcome an expense ratio considerably more than some of the tra-
ditional value alternatives (such as Vanguard’s)? That could be the case, and 
PowerShares has some smart proponents, but I wouldn’t bet the bank on it.

Large growth mutual fund
Vanguard Growth Index (VIGRX)
Indexed to: The MSCI U.S. Prime Market Growth Index, a broadly diversified 
index predominantly made up of growth (fast moving) stocks of large U.S. 
companies. The fund holds about 420 stocks.
Expense ratio: 0.22 percent
Average cap size: $39.5 billion
P/E ratio: 21.0
Minimum initial purchase: $3,000
Minimum initial purchase in IRA: $3,000
Top five holdings: Microsoft, Google, Cisco Systems, Apple, Intel
Notes: This is an excellent choice for large cap growth exposure, especially 
given the low expense ratio. That ratio can be lowered still — to 0.11 — if you 
qualify for the Vanguard Admiral share class of this fund (VIGAX). You can 
also purchase the ETF version of this fund (for a commission) and enjoy the 
same 0.11 expense ratio, with no minimum purchase.
Large growth exchange-traded funds
Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG)
Indexed to: The MSCI U.S. Prime Market Growth Index, a broadly diversified 
index predominantly made up of growth (fast moving) stocks of large U.S. 
companies. The fund holds about 420 stocks.
Expense ratio: 0.11 percent
Average cap size: $39.5 billion
P/E ratio: 21.0
Top five holdings: Microsoft, Google, Cisco Systems, Apple, Intel
Notes: This is the ETF version of the Vanguard Growth Index fund (VIGRX). 
In the area of index mutual funds, Vanguard is often a slam-dunk. With ETFs, 
you have choices, but Vanguard is still a very good one. Note that the current 
lineup of stocks makes this almost a technology-sector fund.

 Chapter 7: Investing in Stock Indexes: Your Gateway to Growth
iShares Morningstar Large Growth (JKE)
Indexed to: The Morningstar U.S. Growth Index, which tracks the perfor-
mance of stocks (673 of them) that are expected to grow at a faster pace than 
the rest of the market as measured by forward earnings, historical earnings, 
book value, cash flow, and sales.
Expense ratio: 0.25 percent
Average cap size: $47.3 billion
P/E ratio: 20.0
Top five holdings: Microsoft, Intel, Cisco Systems, Google, Apple
Notes: This ETF has a higher expense ratio than does Vanguard’s but offers 
potentially better portfolio diversification, given its greater average cap size. 
Morningstar also promises no overlap between its indexes: You’ll never find the 
same holding in both small value and small growth, which I like a lot. Note when 
buying the Morningstar iShares funds that they aren’t traded as frequently as 
are some other ETFs, so you may want to purchase them using a limit order 
rather than a market order. See Chapter 10 for a discussion about trading ETFs.
Small value mutual fund
Vanguard Small-Cap Value Index Fund (VISVX)
Indexed to: The MSCI U.S. Small Cap Value Index, a broadly diversified index 
of value stocks of smaller U.S. companies. The fund holds about 930 stocks.
Expense ratio: 0.23 percent
Average cap size: $1.46 billion
P/E ratio: 15.1
Minimum initial purchase: $3,000
Minimum initial purchase in IRA: $3,000
Top five holdings: Whiting Petroleum Corp., URS Corp., SAIC Inc., Puget 
Energy Inc., Rayonier Inc. REIT
Notes: The Admiral Shares version of this fund (VSMAX), if you qualify, lowers 
your annual expense ratio to 0.13 percent. The ETF version (VBR) carries an 
annual expense of 0.12 percent. Any way you go, it’s hard to lose. This fund is 
a very good way to gain exposure to small value stocks. In the long run, small 
value stocks will probably wind up as your best-returning asset class.

Small value exchange-traded funds
Vanguard Small Value EFT (VBR)
Indexed to: The MSCI U.S. Small Cap Value Index, a broadly diversified index 
of value stocks of smaller U.S. companies. The fund holds about 930 stocks.
Expense ratio: 0.12 percent
Average cap size: $1.46 billion
P/E ratio: 15.1
Top five holdings: Whiting Petroleum Corp., URS Corp., SAIC Inc., Puget 
Energy Inc., Rayonier Inc. REIT
Notes: Whether you choose the mutual-fund version of this ETF (VISVX) or 
the ETF itself, it’s hard to lose. This fund is a very good way to gain exposure 
to small value stocks. In the long run, small cap value stocks will very likely 
turn out to be your best-returning asset class.
iShares Morningstar Small Value (JKL)
Indexed to: The Morningstar Small Value Index, which measures the per-
formance of small cap stocks (305 of them) with relatively low prices given 
anticipated per-share earnings, book value, cash flow, sales, and dividends.
Expense ratio: 0.30 percent
Average cap size: $950 million
P/E ratio: 13.1
Top five holdings: Whiting Petroleum, Tenet Healthcare, Unit Corp., BJ’s 
Wholesale Club, Senior Housing Properties Trust
Notes: This fund has a higher expense ratio than Vanguard’s small cap value 
offering but a lower P/E ratio and small cap size for better diversification. 
Morningstar also promises no overlap between its indexes: You’ll never find 
the same holding in both small value and small growth, which I like a lot. 
Note when buying the Morningstar iShares funds that they aren’t traded as 
frequently as are some other ETFs, so you may want to purchase them using 
a limit order rather than a market order. See Chapter 10 for a discussion 
about trading ETFs.
Small growth mutual fund

Notes: Small growth probably won’t be your best-returning asset class, but 
it is still worth having in your portfolio, for sure. This Vanguard offering is 
a super choice. If you qualify for the Admiral Shares version of this fund 
(VSMAX), the expense ratio drops to 0.13 percent. The ETF version of the 
fund (VBK) is only 0.12 percent.

Notes: This ETF version of the Vanguard Small-Cap Growth Index Fund 
(VISGX) is one of the best small growth ETFs available, both for its breadth 
and its economy.
iShares Morningstar Small Growth (JKK)
Indexed to: The Morningstar Small Growth Index, which measures the per-
formance of small cap stocks (approximately 300 of them) that are expected 
to grow at a faster pace than the rest of the market as measured by forward 
earnings, historical earnings, book value, cash flow, and sales.

P/E ratio: 23.6
Top five holdings: FTI Consulting, Kirby Corp., Alpha Natural Resources, LKQ

Notes: This fund costs more than the Vanguard offering but has a smaller 
average cap size and higher P/E for better diversification. Morningstar also 
promises no overlap between its indexes: You’ll never find the same holding 
in both small value and small growth, which I like a lot. Note when buying the 
Morningstar iShares funds that they aren’t traded as frequently as are some 
other ETFs, so you may want to purchase them using a limit order rather 
than a market order. See Chapter 10 for a discussion about trading ETFs.
International value ETF
iShares MSCI EAFE Value (EFV)
Indexed to: The MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australasia, Far East) Value Index, 
which includes approximately 550 value company stocks from across the 
developed world.
Expense ratio: 0.40 percent
Average cap size: $38.7 billion
P/E ratio: 9.7
Top five holdings: BP, HSBC Holdings, Vodafone Group, TOTAL, Toyota 
Motor Corp.
Notes: This Barclays international value ETF (along with its sister interna-
tional growth fund) is the way to go if you want to split your foreign stocks 
into value and growth. I’m not crazy that MSCI allows for overlap between 
funds (you may find the same stock in both sister funds), but I have no other 
complaints about this reasonably priced, well-diversified security. And yes, 
it is a very good idea to split your international stock holdings — as well as 
your domestic stocks — into value and growth.

Diversify using both style and industry-sector funds
If you take the advice I give in this chapter and 
divide your stock portfolio into large cap, small 
cap, value, and growth, does it still make sense 
to have any industry sector funds? Yes, it may.
Certain industry sectors, like technology and 
financial services, are a huge part of our econ-
omy. Any of your style index funds are sure to 
include a large chunk of either. Breaking the 
sector out further and buying a technology 
index fund or financial services index fund isn’t 
going to add a lot of diversification. But smaller 
sectors may be worth overweighting by buying 
separate index funds.
Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are one 
example, and I discuss those in depth in Chapter 
9. But there may be others. Energy, for example, 
often moves out of lockstep with the rest of the 
stock market. (Use the Vanguard Energy ETF 
[VDE] or the Energy Select Sector SPDR [XLE].) 
And consumer staples — toilet paper and beer 
and such — have a way of staying buoyant even 
in the worst of times. (Use Vanguard Consumer 
Staples [VDC] or the Consumer Staples Select 
Sector SPDR [XLP].) Limit your exposure to 
either sector to no more than 20 percent of your 
domestic stock portfolio.
On rare occasion, if an industry sector — even 
a narrow industry sector — seems impossibly 
beaten down, I might condone allocating a small 
percentage of your equity pie and taking a shot 
on that sector using a sector index fund. This is 
one of two kinds of active management that I 
think are worthy of consideration. The other is 
very carefully choosing index fund–like actively 
managed funds for part of your portfolio. I talk 
about both in Chapter 13.

126
Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
Energy, technology, health care, and more: 
Splitting the pie by industry sector
Some investment gurus champion industry sector funds as a way of slicing 
and dicing the stock market pie, rather than using cap size (large stocks and 
small stocks) and style (value and growth). There is nothing terribly wrong 
with the industry sector approach, although I prefer to use style and size. I 
prefer cap size and style because it necessitates holding fewer funds (four 
versus a dozen or more for the U.S. side of your portfolio), and the funds tend 
to have lower operating expenses than industry sector funds.
If you decide to choose industry sector funds, search for the very same quali-
ties in an index fund that I have suggested all along: broad diversification 
(within each industry group), low costs, transparency (make sure you know 
exactly what you’re buying), tax efficiency (low turnover), and good diversifi-
cation among sector funds.
You can find a handful of technology and real estate index mutual funds, but 
if serious index sector investing is your game plan, ETFs are the way to go.
You have several choices in fund company lineups:
 
✓ Vanguard industry-sector ETFs include the Vanguard Consumer 
Discretionary ETF (VCR), the Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC), 
the Vanguard Energy ETF (VDE), the Vanguard Financials ETF (VFH), 
and seven others. They all carry an expense ratio of 0.22 percent, and 
they represent broad industry groups. Overall rating: A
 
✓ SSgA’s Select SPDRS include the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU), the 
Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK), the Industrial Select Sector SPDR 
(XLI), and half a dozen others. Like Vanguard’s ETFs, these are well-
diversified funds with a modest expense ratio of 0.23 percent. Overall 
rating: A
 
✓ SSgA also offers a lineup of S&P SPDRS that include the SPDR S&P 
Biotech ETF (XBI), the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB), and the 
SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (XME). These have expense ratios 
of 0.35 percent and tend to represent more narrow slivers of the stock 
market. Overall rating: B
 
✓ Barclays iShares offers ETFs in many industry sectors, including 
the iShares Dow Jones U.S. Healthcare ETF (IYH), the iShares Dow 
Jones Transportation ETF (IYT), and the iShares Dow Jones U.S. 
Pharmaceuticals ETF (IHE). The categories tend to be as broad as 
either the Vanguard ETFs or the SPDRs but carry an unnecessarily high 
expense ratio of 0.48 percent. Overall rating: B

127
 Chapter 7: Investing in Stock Indexes: Your Gateway to Growth
 
✓ PowerShares also has a complete lineup of industry sector ETFs, includ-
ing the PowerShares Dynamic Banking ETF (PJB), the PowerShares 
Dynamic Insurance ETF (PIC), and the PowerShares Dynamic 
Semiconductor ETF (PSI). These are narrow in scope, use questionable 
methodologies to form the indexes, and cost 0.60 percent a year in man-
agement fees. Overall rating: C
 
✓ I would advise you to avoid Merrill Lynch’s HOLDRS ETFs, which tend 
to have very concentrated holdings, complicated pricing, and purchase 
requirements. Overall rating: C-
 
✓ Also avoid the HealthShares series of industry-sliver ETFs that include 
the HealthShares Emerging Cancer ETF (HHJ), the HealthShares 
Autoimmune-Inflammation ETF (HHA), and the HealthShares 
Ophthalmology ETF (HHZ). They’re expensive (0.75 percent a year) and, 
well, there’s just no reason to hold these tiny market slivers, essentially 
market bets, in any portfolio. Will there be a cancer cure in the next sev-
eral years? Perhaps. Will that make The HealthShares Emerging Cancer 
ETF soar? Not necessarily. One of the companies in the fund may see its 
stock shoot to the sky, but the others, the losers in the race for a cancer 
cure, would very likely tank at the same time. Overall rating: D.
Exploring the Outer Limits of 
Indexed Stock Investing
There is nothing wrong with your television set. Do not attempt to adjust the pic-
ture. We are controlling transmission. If we wish to make it louder, we will bring 
up the volume. If we wish to make it softer, we will tune it to a whisper. We will 
control the horizontal. We will control the vertical . . . Welcome to the Outer 
Limits of index stock investing.
This is where indexers of a decade or two ago couldn’t even imagine we 
would be today . . . for better or worse. The categories I have in mind are 
screened index funds (such as socially conscious funds), high dividend 
funds, leveraged funds, inverse funds, and leveraged inverse funds.
Socially conscious stock index funds: 
Putting your money where your heart is
If you don’t like the idea of investing in tobacco, nuclear weapons, or coun-
tries that have no child-labor laws, there are screened indexes (and index 
funds) that filter out such undesirable investments.

128
Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
Some people argue that companies that do good tend to do well. Maybe 
that’s true. None of these funds has been around long enough to know for 
sure. In most cases, socially responsible funds cost a little bit extra but not 
so much that you should be turned off to them.
A few good index options are available. I would urge you to use the same set 
of criteria you would for any other index investment: Look for overall low 
cost, a respectable management team, an index that makes sense, and tax 
efficiency.
With a socially conscious fund you also have one other consideration: Is the 
management team using its muscle to lobby companies to do better for the 
world? I hate to say it, but the management of any index fund will probably 
not be as active in this regard as would the management of an actively man-
aged fund. For active management you want active management — duh.
Nonetheless, here are a few socially conscious index fund options to 
consider:
 
✓ If you want a mutual fund, choose the Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund 
(VFTSX). This is a large cap U.S. fund with an expense ratio of 0.23 per-
cent and a minimum investment of $3,000. The top five companies are 
Microsoft, AT&T, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, and Cisco 
Systems. The funds filters out the corporate riff-raff.
 
✓ Among ETFs, you have several options:
 
• The iShares Select Social Index Fund (KLD) uses a popular index 
that overweights companies purportedly making money in ethical 
fashion and underweights companies that aren’t. It is a large cap 
U.S. fund, mostly growth companies, with an expense ratio of 0.50 
percent. The top five companies are Microsoft, AT&T, Procter & 
Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, and Cisco Systems.
 
• You may also choose the iShares KLD 400 Social ETF (DSI), which 
attempts to eliminate companies involved in the production of 
tobacco, firearms, gambling, or anything nuclear. The expense 
ratio is 0.50 percent, and the companies are large U.S., mostly 
growth. The top five companies are Johnson & Johnson, Wells 
Fargo, IBM, General Mills, and Kimberly-Clarke.
 
• A handful of other ETFs are based on indexes of companies work-
ing on clean energy or other environmentally beneficial projects. 
Options include the PowerShares WilderHill Clean Energy ETF 
(PWB), the Van Eck Market Vectors–Global Alternative Energy ETF 
(GEX), and the Van Eck Market Vectors–Solar Energy ETF (KWT). 
All these offerings are on the pricier side of ETFs, and I have to 
wonder if choosing a reasonably priced actively managed fund in 
this area may not make more sense.

129
 Chapter 7: Investing in Stock Indexes: Your Gateway to Growth
High dividend funds: Wanting 
cash in hand
People love dividends. But is that love warranted? I don’t think so. Whether 
a company’s extra cash is issued directly to you (the investor) in the form 
of a dividend or funneled back into the company in which you are invested 
should not, in the long run, make a whole lot of difference. In fact, studies 
show that companies that pay high dividends, which tend to be value compa-
nies, don’t necessarily provide any better returns to investors over time than 
any other value companies do.
So why have a gadzillion high dividend–paying ETFs hit the markets in the 
past years? It’s because dividend-paying stocks performed exceptionally well 
for a few years, and investors made the eternally wrong decision that that 
would have to continue. Wall Street has been more than happy to cater to the 
market’s whims.
As I discuss in Chapter 16, the best way to raise cash (should you need it) is 
not through dividends but through regular portfolio rebalancing.
So in the end, I don’t really suggest dividend funds. If, however, you feel you 
must, an index fund makes enormous sense. As always, I urge you to choose 
one that is low-cost and well diversified. Two good options are the Vanguard 
High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM) with an annual expense ratio of 0.25 percent 
and the WisdomTree Total Dividend Fund (DTD) with an expense ratio of 0.28 
percent.
Leveraged and inverse “indexing”: 
Taking a gamble
Enter now into the twilight zone . . . beyond the outer limits of index invest-
ing. There are a few investments that I’m not sure whether to include in a 
book on index investing. So I’m going to compromise and mention them 
briefly.
Leveraged funds take a basic index (say the S&P 500) and, through a lot of 
financial hocus pocus, promise you a return double the index (more or less). 
They exist in mutual fund form, but most are ETFs.
Inverse funds promise you a return in direct inverse (more or less) from the 
index: If the index goes down 5 percent, your fund goes up 5 percent, minus 
expenses.

130
Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
Some funds are leveraged inverse funds, meaning that if the index goes down 
5 percent, you could stand to profit 10 percent.
Scores of these funds — nearly all of them ETFs — have been introduced in 
the past year or so. ProShares has a lineup of dozens. So does Rydex. Using 
one company’s ETFs or the other’s, you can leverage or short just about any 
kind of index imaginable, from U.S. stocks and foreign stocks to individual 
industry sectors to non-equities, like bonds and commodities.
Why would anyone wish to do such a thing? To make double the money, of 
course! But, believe me, there is a catch (actually three, including one whopper):
 
✓ First catch: The leveraged indexes include no dividends.
 
✓ Second catch: These funds are expensive, charging between 0.70 per-
cent and 0.95 percent in operating fees . . . way more than most ETFs.
 
✓ Third catch (the Big One): These funds double (or triple) your money 
on a daily basis, but that often means falling considerably short of dou-
bling your money in the long run. The math is a bit tricky, but here it 
goes. Pay attention!
 
 Imagine that you own $1,000 worth of shares in the Ultra Semiconductors 
ProShares ETF (USD), which charges you 0.95 percent for the honor of 
tracking the Dow Jones Semiconductors Index and doubling your money 
on a daily basis. Suppose that the Semiconductors Index goes up 10 
percent tomorrow but then drops 10 percent the next day. Even Steven? 
Well, no. Tomorrow, your $1,000 invested in the index is suddenly worth 
$1,100. The next day it drops 10 percent and is worth $990. Overall, the 
fund lost 1 percent ($10) in two days. The ETF, meanwhile, gets double 
the punch both ways. Tomorrow, your $1,000 gains 20 percent and sud-
denly is worth $1,200. But the next day it drops 20 percent and is now 
worth $960. Uh-oh. You didn’t lose 1 percent, as you would have in the 
index; you lost a total of 4 percent ($40). Ouch. Volatility, all things being 
equal, is not a good thing! You are getting double or triple the risk with 
leveraged indexes (perhaps more!), but not double or triple the return.
 
If you want to take more risk in your portfolio, you should get commensurate 
returns! Move from bonds to stocks or from large cap stocks to small cap or 
micro cap stocks before you consider a move to leveraged funds.
As for the inverse funds, these have existed for years in mutual fund form and 
recently have become all the rage in ETF form. But betting against the market 
is betting! The stock market goes up and down, but mostly it goes up. If you put 
your dollars on it going down, you are very likely to lose in the long run. If you 
want to hedge your long bets on stocks, do so with other asset classes — like 
bonds and commodities — that are likely to have positive long-term returns.

131

hether driving on a calm spring day or a wicked winter night, for the 
sake of safety, you’re well advised to wear your seat belt and shoul-
der strap. In fact, it’s the law. Investing in the stock market in smooth times 
(do those exist anymore?) or rocky times, you are advised to invest in bonds, 
as well. It’s for the sake of safety. It should be a law.
Bonds are not typically high-yielding investments, but bonds — particularly 
high-quality bonds, which is the kind I generally recommend — tend to be 
stable, which is their main purpose in life. They’ll keep your portfolio afloat 
when everything else is sinking like stones. If your grandparents weren’t 
reduced to selling apples in the street during the Great Depression, bonds 
were very likely the reason.
Just as the world of stocks offers many index funds in which to invest, so too 
does the world of bonds. And what makes sense in one world makes about 
just as much sense in the other . . . although, as I discuss shortly, not neces-
sarily for all the same reasons.
In this chapter, I introduce you to bond index funds. I reveal why you want 
them in your portfolio, and I help you to figure out which are the very best 
choices for you.

Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
Getting a Handle on What Bonds 
Are and Why You Want Them
Investment opportunities abound: stocks, bonds, real estate investment 
trusts, oil wells . . . But when all is said and done, despite all the fancy names 
and myriad money-making schemes, you can generally divide the entire 
world of investments into but two categories:
 
✓ Equity: Things you buy and own, and that you hope will appreciate in 
value. They may or may not pay dividends. Examples include stocks, 
commodities, real estate, and collectibles.
 
✓ Debt: Money you lend to someone else in return for that someone’s prom-
ise to pay you interest, usually for a certain period of time, and, when that 
period of time has expired, to return your money in full. Examples include 
bonds and CDs, as well as IOUs from your brother-in-law.
Stocks (and stock funds) are the mostly popular form of equity investment. 
Bonds (and bond funds) are the most popular form of debt instrument. 
That’s largely because everything else is, generally speaking, more prob-
lematic. The IOU from your brother-in-law will probably never be paid back, 
or only paid back in beer. The CD barely keeps up with inflation. The com-
modities are too volatile. The rental real estate is a pain in the neck, with the 
tenants calling you at all hours of the night. And making money in precious 
collectibles requires a lot of expertise, not to mention a safe and insurance.
In comparison with most other investments, stocks and bonds are easy . . . 
and often the most profitable.
Traveling into bondland
Bonds are not only the largest category of debt but also the largest invest-
ment of any kind — including stocks.
According to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association 
(SIFMA), the total value of all bonds issued around the world is now a little 
over $67 trillion. In contrast, the total value of all stocks issued around the 
world — the investment that gets the lion’s share of media attention — is 
“only” about $54 trillion. To put both numbers into some kind of perspective, 
if you took the gross domestic product (the value of all goods and services 
produced in a year) of every single country on earth, and added them all up, 
you’d get a figure (according to the World Bank) of about $65 trillion.
So who issues all those bonds, and in what parts of the planet?

135
 Chapter 8: Investing in Bond Indexes: Protecting Your Principal
Here’s what SIFMA says: Of all the bonds issued in 2006, 49 percent were 
issued in the United States, about 24 percent were issued in Europe, 13 per-
cent were issued by Japan, and the remainder came from all the other coun-
tries of the world.
Most of the bonds on the planet — 64 percent, according to Bank of 
International Settlements — are issued by corporate concerns such as 
Toyota, Bayer, General Electric, Honda, and so on. The rest — 36 percent — 
are issued by governments. They may come from federal governments (obli-
gations of central governments, such as U.S. Treasury bonds, are generically 
known as sovereign bonds), as well as state and local governments (these are 
often referred to as municipal bonds).
Recognizing the many different 
breeds of bond
Different kinds of bonds have different characteristics. But in general, most 
bonds are issued in denominations of $1,000, most make interest payments 
(often called coupon payments) twice a year, and most come with ratings — 
AA, A, BBB, and so on — that give you some idea of the creditworthiness of 
the issuer. The more creditworthy the government or corporation that issues 
the bond, the lower the interest rate will generally be. That’s because lower-
rated issuers must pay higher interest rates, or investors simply wouldn’t 
want their (riskier) bonds.
Bonds can be categorized in different ways. Often, they are referred to by the 
nature of the issuer: They are government bonds, corporate bonds, or agency 
bonds.
But they may also be categorized by their quality. Quality, in bondtalk, means 
the financial muscle of the issuer. Those bonds that come from borrowers 
with lots of financial muscle (strong companies and governments) are com-
monly called investment-grade bonds. Those that come from weaker issuers 
are often referred to as high-yield (that’s the positive spin) or junk bonds (the 
negative spin).
There are credit-rating agencies that (in addition to making a lot of money 
for themselves) help investors to better fine-tune the quality of a bond. Bond 
funds, index or other, generally lump their bond holdings by such quality 
distinctions. In Table 8-1, I outline these distinctions and what they mean 
according to three of the most popular credit-rating agencies: Moody’s, 
Standard and Poor’s, and Fitch. Note that the ratings shown in the table do 
not apply to municipal bonds. Munis (the vast majority of which tend to be 
high-quality bonds) have their own rating system.

Bonds also come in taxable and tax-free form. The term tax-free usually 
means that a bond is issued by a municipality, and the interest payments are 
generally free from federal income tax and sometimes (particularly if you buy 
a bond in your home state) free of local taxes, as well. Bonds issued by the 
U.S. Treasury are never referred to as tax-free because you do pay federal 
income tax on the interest, but you won’t pay state or local income tax.
Finally, bonds are also commonly categorized by their maturity dates. Those 
bonds with maturity dates of 12 years or more in the future are called long-
term bonds or, for short, long bonds. Bonds with maturity dates of less than 
12 years but more than 5 years are called intermediate bonds. And any bond 
with a maturity of less than 5 years away is called a short-term or simply a 
short bond. Long bonds usually pay higher interest rates than short bonds.
Since this is a book on indexing, I talk more about bond funds than I do about 
individual bonds. Whereas bond funds do not have maturity dates, per se, 
most funds, including index funds, are made up of bonds of somewhat similar 
maturities, be they short, intermediate, or long. Bond funds comprised of 
long bonds usually yield higher return but with greater volatility. Bond funds 
comprised of very short bonds often behave much as money-market funds 
do, with little volatility but modest return.

137
 Chapter 8: Investing in Bond Indexes: Protecting Your Principal
Keeping your expectations realistic
Even the longest of bonds (with 30 years maturity) and even the riskiest of 
bonds (the so-called high-yield or junk bonds) rarely yield the same kind of 
returns that stocks do. In the long run, most bonds yield considerably less 
than stocks. What is true of individual securities is equally true of funds: 
Bond funds tend to yield considerably less than stock funds over time.
According to figures from Morningstar, one dollar invested in long-term gov-
ernment bonds at year-end 1925, with all coupons reinvested, grew to $78.78 
by year-end 2007. This represents a compound annual growth rate over the 
82-year period of 5.5 percent. One dollar invested in long-term corporate 
bonds at year-end 1925, with all coupons reinvested, grew to $105.86 by year-
end 2007. This represents a compound annual growth rate over the decades 
of 5.9 percent.
Adjusted for inflation, the real return on government bonds has historically 
been about 2.4 percent; corporate bonds have yielded about 2.7 percent. 
This compares to a real (post-inflation) return of about 7.1 percent for large-
company stocks and 9.1 percent for small-company stocks.
 
As you can see, bonds over the past eight decades have returned consider-
ably less than half what stocks have. When you factor in taxes, you’re looking 
at even less than that. Moral of story: Don’t expect to get rich off bonds. That 
isn’t what they’re for!
Buying bonds for the right reasons
If you aren’t going to make a lot of money off your bonds, there must be 
another reason to buy them, or I wouldn’t be devoting an entire chapter to 
bonds, right? Right! And the reason must be the steady stream of income that 
bonds provide, right? Wrong!
Yes, bonds do provide a steady stream of income (except for zero-coupon 
bonds, which pay all your interest in a lump sum upon maturity). If you 
choose bond funds (and as an index investor, that’s exactly what you would 
do), you’ll similarly get a steady stream of income.
But for most investors — even including retired people living off the fruits 
of their portfolios — I generally don’t advocate using that steady stream of 
income to pay the bills. I explain more in Chapter 16, but in short, the best way 
to tap a portfolio is through regular rebalancing. You sell whatever has done 
the best and buy (or leave untouched) those assets that haven’t done as well.

138
Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
If bonds have produced more than stocks, you sell off your bonds (or index 
bond funds). If stocks have produced more than bonds, you sell off your 
stocks (or index stock funds.) By doing that, you are allowing that steady 
stream of income to be reinvested into your bond funds, preventing your 
principal from getting eaten up by inflation and tapping into the funds only 
when the going is good. This method of raising cash allows you a rebalancing 
bonus: By constantly selling high and buying low, you juice your total returns. 
(How much you juice your returns depends on the performance and volatility 
of your portfolio, but we’re talking ballpark 0.50 percent a year.)
The reason that I want you to own bonds, if not for cash flow, is this: 
diversification.
 
Bonds offer the surest, most time-tested way of diversifying a portfolio of pri-
marily stock. Bonds very often (but not always) provide zig when stocks zag. 
And that is why you want them.
In Figure 8-1, you can see the delicious lack of correlation: When stocks per-
form well, bonds (at least high-quality bonds) often don’t, and vice versa. 
And that, dear reader, is what protecting a portfolio through diversification is 
all about.

 Chapter 8: Investing in Bond Indexes: Protecting Your Principal
Banking on predictability
Unlike stocks, bonds promise you a steady stream of income. Whether you 
decide to tap into that stream of income or not is your choice. But bonds also 
tend to have much more stable prices than do stocks. The prices of bonds 
can go up or down, but they usually go up when you need them to most — 
when stocks are tanking.
When the going is tough for the stock markets, money is often said to “rush 
to safety,” which is really a euphemism for cash and bonds. When lots of 
people are scrambling to buy something — anything, be it bonds, bacon, or 
bananas — the price of that something will usually (if you remember from 
Economics 101) be driven up. Simple supply and demand is one reason that 
quality bonds are a good thing to have in bad economic times.
Another reason relates to interest rates. During a recession or depression, 
interest rates usually drop, which is partially a byproduct of low inflation and 
partially a result of government tinkering to try to get more steam into the 
engines of industry. As interest rates drop, bonds in existence (paying “old,” 
higher interest rates) tend to rise in value. And that is the second reason that 
quality bonds tend to more than hold their own during the darkest of eco-
nomic times.
In Figure 8-2, you can see that the worst years for stocks have generally been 
rollicking good times for bonds.

Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
There are other means of diversifying a portfolio that is primarily stocks, for 
sure. But none is as powerful as bonds. Hedge funds? They’re expensive and 
unpredictable. Gold? The gold metal is volatile as hell, and the price over the 
past 100 years has just kept even with inflation. Cash, CDs? Great, you need 
cash, but you won’t get much of a return . . . you’ll very likely lose money to 
inflation, even by shopping the best CD rates in town.
Consider how bonds would have protected your portfolio in the last bear 
market. Say you had a $100,000 portfolio before the market slide, on August 
31, 2000. What would your portfolio have been worth on September 30, 2002, 
after 25 horrid months for the stock market? Consider three scenarios:
 
✓ 100 percent invested in stocks: Ending value $55,880
 
✓ 60 percent in stocks, 40 percent in bonds: Ending value $82,900
 
✓ 40 percent in stocks, 60 percent in bonds: $96,410
 
✓ 100 percent in bonds: $123,430
Note: For “stocks,” I am using the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 Composite Index; 
for “bonds,” I am using the Lehman Brothers U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.
Bonds are the best hedge going. And there’s no better way to hold bonds, 
generally speaking, than in the form of a bond index fund.
Entering the World of Bond Index Funds
Bond indexes are somewhat trickier to construct than are stock indexes. 
That’s in large part because there are thousands of stocks but millions of 
bonds out there. One corporation or one government, for example, may issue 
many different series of bonds, each with its own coupon rate, maturity, and 
call features. How do you possibly corral such a large and diverse universe 
and create an index, never mind an index fund of a manageable number of 
securities that can accurately represent the entire kit and caboodle?
It isn’t easy. And largely for that reason, bond indexing has lagged stock 
indexing by a large margin. In the world of traditional mutual funds, accord-
ing to Morningstar, a mere 2.55 percent of fixed-income funds in the United 
States are index funds (29 out of 1,137). These index funds account for 8.9 
percent of all bond-fund money ($107 billion out of $1.2 trillion). This figure 
does not include any municipal bonds, as there are no indexed municipal 
bond mutual funds.

141
 Chapter 8: Investing in Bond Indexes: Protecting Your Principal
But the recent advent of ETFs has rocked both Wall Street and fixed-income 
investing, and now, for the first time ever, bond indexing is coming into its 
own. Virtually all ETFs are index funds. The number of fixed-income ETFs — 
including a few municipal offerings — is now 55 and growing fast. Together 
these 55 bond ETFs total more than $45 billion in assets.
As you can see in Table 8-2, bond index funds have an impressive history, 
tending to clobber actively managed bond funds — just as stock index funds 
tend to clobber actively managed stock funds. The table shows the percent-
age of actively managed funds that underperformed appropriate indexes over 
the ten-year period ending December 31, 2006.

The reason bond index funds do so well vis-à-vis actively managed bond 
funds is a wee bit different than the reason stock index funds do so well. 
Bond investing is potentially less efficient than stock investing. That is, 
because there are so many bonds issued (way more than stocks) and 
because bonds tend to be more complicated than stocks, a really smart man-
ager can more easily find inefficiencies in the market — cases where he can 
actually beat the market by finding superior securities.
On the other hand, the operating fees when buying a bond fund are even 
more important than they are when buying a stock fund. This is so because 
the anticipated returns are so much less. If you expect to earn only 5 percent 
a year on a bond fund, paying a manager 1.5 percent means that you are dish-
ing out 30 percent of your gains to the manager. A stock fund expected to 
earn 10 percent a year can charge 1.5 percent a year, and that requires that 
you fork over “only” 15 percent of your gains to the manager. Big difference.
Note that the bond index funds I recommend (coming in just a minute!) tend 
to charge waaaay less than 1.5 percent — and some actively managed bond 
funds charge waaaay more than that! (In the case of those very expensive 

142
Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
bond funds, the long-term performance records are painfully predictable. 
Consider, for example, the Morgan Stanley High-Yield Security C Fund, with 
an annual expense ratio of 2.20 percent. The 10-year average annual return on 
this “gem” is –3.53 percent. Ugh.)
Finding a good bond mutual fund
With only 29 index bond mutual funds, the pickings aren’t huge. I look for 
low costs, broad and solid indexes, and low costs (did I already mention low 
costs?). The particular kind of bond you choose, and how large an allotment 
to give to your portfolio, I address in Part III. Here, I simply present a few top-
notch selections — index funds appropriate to most portfolios — along with 
some particulars you should know about each fund.
Vanguard Total Bond Market Index (VBMFX)
Indexed to: The Lehman U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. Although the index 
includes over 9,000 bonds, this fund uses a (very healthy) representative 
sampling of nearly 2,700 bonds. About 80 percent of those have a Moody’s 
rating of Aaa, meaning the risk of defaults within the fund is negligible. (With 
2,700 bonds, if one or two did default, it would amount to nothing more than 
a burp anyway.)
Expense ratio: 0.18 percent
Average maturity: 7.0 years
Quality of bonds: Very high
Minimum investment: $3,000
Minimum investment in IRA: $3,000
Notes: It’s hard to go wrong with a bond fund that charges this little and gives 
you exposure to such a broad index (you won’t find broader). If you qualify 
for the Admiral Share class of this fund ($100,000 invested immediately, or 
$50,000 invested in the fund over ten years), the expense ratio drops to an 
extremely friendly 0.10 percent.
T. Rowe Price U.S. Bond Index (PBDIX)
Indexed to: The Lehman Brothers U.S. Aggregate Index, which consists of 
about 9,000 investment-grade bonds, including Treasuries, agency bonds, 
and corporate bonds. This fund uses about 520 bonds to capture the perfor-
mance of the index.

143
 Chapter 8: Investing in Bond Indexes: Protecting Your Principal
Expense ratio: 0.30 percent
Average maturity: 7.0 years
Quality of bonds: Very high
Minimum investment: $2,500
Minimum investment in IRA: $1,000
Notes: This fund is very similar to the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index, 
with a higher expense ratio but lower minimum. Use it if you are just getting 
started. Use it if you happen to have your money at T. Rowe Price and like 
their service. Note that the fund invests in fewer bonds than does Vanguard. 
These are mostly high-quality bonds, and yet, the lesser number of bonds 
will raise the risk of this fund just a bit. If one or two bonds should happen to 
default, it may make more than a burping sound.
Unit investment trusts (UITs): 
The pseudo-index of bonds
Some brokerage houses wrap up a bundle of 
bonds, usually 20 to 30 of them, and sell them 
to customers as a package deal. They call them 
unit investment trusts. There’s a commission to 
buy the bundle (usually 1 to 3 percent) and a 
modest management fee (typically 0.20 to 0.30 
percent) that you pay on a yearly basis. The UIT 
will have a maturity date of anywhere from a 
year to possibly 30 years down the road. When 
the UIT matures, just as is the case with an indi-
vidual bond, you get back your principal. Before 
the UIT matures, the bonds just pay you interest 
collectively, and the managers don’t play with 
the mix.
In other words, a UIT is like a mini-index of 
bonds . . . sort of. Some brokers may make a 
big deal about how their UITs are handpicked 
and likely to outperform the bond market. Other, 
more honest brokers present them for what 
they are: pseudo-indexes that offer you instant 
diversification in the bond market. A well put-
together UIT can make as much sense as a 
comparable (similar bond quality and maturity) 
index mutual fund or ETF. But because you pay 
a commission, you want to make sure this is 
going to be a fairly long-term investment. I’m 
not sure, for example, that a one-year UIT, no 
matter how well constructed, would be a wise 
investment.
Most bond UITs require a minimum investment 
of $5,000.

144
Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
Vanguard Short-term Bond Index (VBISX)
Indexed to: Lehman 1–5 Year U.S. Government/Credit Index. The fund holds 
approximately 900 bonds, two-thirds of which are Treasuries or U.S. agency 
bonds, and the rest are investment-grade corporate bonds. All are short 
term, meaning less return but less volatility.
Expense ratio: 0.18 percent
Average maturity: 2.4 years
Quality of bonds: Very high
Minimum investment: $3,000
Minimum investment in IRA: $3,000
Notes: Given that these are short-term, high-quality bonds, you aren’t going 
to get rich off the interest payments from this fund. But your money will be 
safe. And you’ll tweak out a little more than you would in an all-Treasury 
fund, such as the Fidelity option immediately following. If you qualify for the 
Admiral Share class of this fund ($100,000 invested immediately, or $50,000 
invested in the fund over ten years), the expense ratio drops to a jolly 0.10 
percent.
Fidelity Spartan Intermediate Treasury Bond Index Fund (FIBIX)
Indexed to: Lehman Brothers 5–10 Year U.S. Treasury Bond Index
Expense ratio: 0.20 percent
Average maturity: 6.3 years
Quality of bonds: Highest
Minimum investment: $10,000
Minimum investment in IRA: $10,000
Notes: Given the intermediate-term maturities and the iron-clad guarantee of 
the U.S. government, you aren’t going to get a very high rate of interest with 
this bond fund, but you’ll know your money is secure. The operating fee is 
certainly reasonable. This is a very good option for a place to park money 
that you feel you may need in a few years, or money that you want to make 
sure will be intact even in the worst of economic conditions. The Advantage 
Class of this fund (FIBAX) charges only 0.10 percent a year in expenses.

 Chapter 8: Investing in Bond Indexes: Protecting Your Principal
Buying a fixed-income 
exchange-traded fund
Bond ETFs have become an important part of the growth of the ETF market. 
From the time I finish writing this book to the time it appears in print, there 
could be a whole fresh crop of them out there! (Appendix C lets you know 
where to go on the Web for the latest fund updates.) Some of the bond ETFs 
are great, and others not-so-great. Here, I present some of the better choices.
Note: As with all ETFs, you’ll pay a commission to buy and sell, which is usu-
ally modest. But remember that those commissions can add up if you are 
regularly depositing money or making withdrawals. If that’s your game plan, 
you may be better off with a mutual fund.
Second note: ETFs have a reputation for being tax efficient, and that reputation 
is largely well-deserved. Keep in mind, however, that the vast majority of money 
produced by bond funds — whether ETFs or mutual funds, index funds or 
actively managed funds — will be interest, not capital gains. Interest, unless you 
get it from municipal tax-free bonds, is going to be taxable as regular income. 
The great tax efficiency of stock ETFs doesn’t, by and large, translate to bonds.
Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND)
Indexed to: The (very broad) Lehman U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. Although the 
index includes more than 9,000 bonds, this fund uses a (very healthy) represen-
tative sampling of nearly 2,700 bonds. About 80 percent of those have a Moody’s 
rating of Aaa, meaning the risk of any defaults in the portfolio are small.
Expense ratio: 0.11 percent
Average maturity: 7.1 years
Quality of bonds: Very high
Notes: This is the ETF version of the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index 
mutual fund (VBMFX). It is essentially the very same beast but with a lower 
expense ratio (unless you should happen to qualify for the Admiral Shares 
class of the mutual fund) and no minimum investment.
iShares Lehman TIPS Bond Fund (TIP)
Indexed to: Lehman Brothers U.S. Treasury TIPS Index. TIPS stands for 
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. This fund adjusts with inflation, while 
giving you a very modest rate of return beyond that rate of inflation. This fund 
uses 24 bonds to match the index. Since these bonds have the full backing of 
the U.S. government, there is no need for greater diversification — 24 is fine.

146
Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
Expense ratio: 0.20 percent
Average maturity: 9.6 years
Quality of bonds: Highest
Notes: In Chapter 12, I help you determine whether TIPS belong in your port-
folio. For most folks, the answer is yes — roughly one-third of a typical bond 
portfolio should be in TIPS. Owning the iShares fund is a darned good way to 
achieve that goal.
iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond (LQD)
Indexed to: iBoxx $ Liquid Investment Grade Index, an index of 100 bonds 
(the fund also holds 100 bonds) that seek to capture the performance of the 
entire U.S. investment-grade corporate bond market. Despite the funny name, 
the iBoxx index makes sense!
Expense ratio: 0.20 percent
Average maturity: 11.6 years
Quality of bonds: Medium high
Notes: Quality corporate bonds, over the course of time, tend to return about 
1 percent a year higher than Treasuries of similar maturity. (High-yield cor-
porate bonds tend to return yet another point or two above.) If corporate 
bonds belong in your portfolio, this iShares offering is a very good way to get 
them there.
SPDR Lehman Municipal Bond ETF (TFI)
Indexed to: Lehman Brothers Municipal Managed Money Index, an index of 
long-term, tax-exempt bonds from municipalities across the nation. The fund 
uses approximately 130 bonds to mirror the performance of the index.
Expense ratio: 0.20 percent
Average maturity: 9.1 years
Quality of bonds: Very high
Notes: If tax-free is a priority (as it should be if you are in a high tax bracket 
and you are investing in a taxable account), this fund may be just the ticket 
for your bond portfolio — either part or all of it. An expense ratio of 0.20 per-
cent is quite reasonable, especially considering the high markups involved in 
trading individual municipal bonds.

 Chapter 8: Investing in Bond Indexes: Protecting Your Principal
PowerShares Emerging Markets Sovereign Debt Portfolio (PCY)
Indexed to: The Deutsche Bank Emerging Market U.S. Dollar Balanced Liquid 
Index, an index that provides access to the sovereign debt of approximately 
17 emerging market countries.
Expense ratio: 0.50 percent
Average maturity: 15.6 years
Quality of bonds: So-so
Notes: If you want high-yield (junk) bonds, it may make more sense to have 
international junk than U.S. junk. I explain why in a sidebar in Chapter 12. If 
you want to take an indexed approach, this fund is currently the only option 
you have. I’m not crazy about the 0.50 percent fee — on the high side for an 
ETF — but it’s lower than you’ll pay for any emerging-market debt mutual 
fund. Feel free to go with PowerShares for now, but keep your eyes open for a 
less expensive offering down the road.
Inverse bond index funds: The worst 
investment idea of all time?
On May 1, 2008, ProShares introduced the 
first inverse bond index funds: the UltraShort 
Lehman 7–10 Year Treasury (PST) and the 
ProShares UltraShort Lehman 20+ Year 
Treasury (TBT). Here’s the concept: If the bond 
index goes down, your fund goes up. More 
inverse bond funds are sure to follow. As you 
know if you read Chapter 7, I’m not a big fan 
of inverse stock index funds, but compared to 
inverse bond index funds, inverse stock index 
funds are pure gold!
Unlike stocks, which go up and down and up 
and down, bonds just aren’t all that volatile. And 
when they do go down, they generally don’t go 
down all that much. You’re going to pay a gross 
expense ratio of 1.16 percent for a fund that will 
pay you the daily inverse of an index that usu-
ally goes up, and when it goes down, doesn’t 
often go down by much? Um . . . Er . . . 
The purveyors are selling these funds as 
“hedges” against potential losses in bonds. But 
. . . but . . . bonds themselves are hedges, and 
hedges don’t need hedges! If you truly, truly 
have clairvoyant powers, yes, you can make 
money by bopping in and out of these funds in 
anticipation of the occasional sudden drop in 
the bond market. For most of us mere mortals, 
however, these funds are virtually guaranteed 
to lose money in the long run. Unless, of course, 
you happen to be the company selling one!

Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
Mixing and Matching Bonds and Stocks 
with an All-in-One Index Fund
For the ultimate in simplicity, you may want to choose a single fund that com-
bines bonds with stocks. This may be a good choice if you have more than 
$3,000 but less than $30,000 to invest. Funds that combine stocks and bonds 
are known as balanced funds.
Choosing the static option
There is, as far as I’m concerned, only one choice for a combined stock-and-
bond all-in-one-portfolio among index funds: the Vanguard Balanced Index 
mutual fund. It is low cost, broadly diversified, and could be just the ticket to 
an instant portfolio . . . for some.
Note that the Vanguard Balanced Index fund is static: It is basically 60 per-
cent stock and 40 percent bonds. That’s the way it is today and will be tomor-
row. There are also variable options that change the ratio over time. These 
are called lifecycle funds, and I’m not crazy about them. I discuss why in a 
minute. First, allow me to introduce the Vanguard balanced offering.
Vanguard Balanced Index (VBINX)
Indexed to: 60 percent MSCI U.S. Broad Market Index and 40 percent Lehman 
U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. Together, we’re talking 3,450 stocks and 1,885 
bonds. The bonds are Treasuries, agency bonds, and investment-grade 
corporates.
Expense ratio: 0.19 percent
Average maturity (bond portion of portfolio): 7 years
Quality of bonds: High
Minimum investment: $3,000
Minimum investment in IRA: $3,000
Notes: If you belong in a 60/40 portfolio (60 percent stocks/40 percent 
bonds), you really can’t lose with this simple all-in-one broad index fund. 
The question is, of course, whether you do belong in a 60/40 portfolio. That’s 
something I can and do help you address in Chapter 11. If you qualify for the 

149
 Chapter 8: Investing in Bond Indexes: Protecting Your Principal
Admiral Share class of this fund ($100,000 invested immediately, or $50,000 
invested in the fund over ten years), the expense ratio drops to an extremely 
sweet and savory 0.10 percent.
Considering the variable options
Unlike the Vanguard (static) option for all-in-one investing, there are also 
variable options, otherwise known as lifecycle funds. In late 2007, a company 
called XShares Advisors teamed up with Amerivest Investment Management, 
a subsidiary of TD Ameritrade, to offer a bunch of lifecycle ETFs. These are 
index funds, and I know as an index investing advocate I’m supposed to like 
index funds, but I’m not too wild about these.
Currently, there are five lifecycle ETFs: The TDAX Independence 2010 ETF 
(TDD); the TDAX Independence 2020 ETF (TDH); the TDAX Independence 
2030 ETF (TDN); the TDAX Independence 2040 ETF (TDV); and the TDAX 
Independence In-Target ETF (TDX).
All the funds have an expense ratio of 0.65 percent, and they track various 
lifecycle indices developed by Zacks Investment Research. A lifecycle index 
assumes that you want a more conservative portfolio as you get older. (Fair 
enough.) And so you pick a retirement date, such as 2020, 2030, or 2040, and 
the portfolio shifts over time from more aggressive (mostly stock) to more 
conservative (mostly bonds).
It sounds good in theory, but it’s rather cookie-cutter, wouldn’t you say? 
These funds assume that all people aiming to retire in the same year — rich 
and poor, healthy and unhealthy, with kids and without kids, good-looking 
and ugly — warrant the very same portfolio. Um . . . okay, maybe good-
looking and ugly deserve the same portfolio. But all those others, too? No. 
Investing isn’t that simple. And so I can’t recommend these lifecycle index 
funds.
Your perfect portfolio “pie” should be determined by many factors. I review 
them in Part III.

n the not-so-distant past, if you wanted gold, you could either pan for it or 
go to a dealer and buy bricks or coins. Neither option was a particularly 
easy way to invest. Panning got your hands dirty. Buying bricks was perhaps 
easier, but you still had to make sure you were buying the real thing and not 
fool’s gold. You’d need an assessment, and that would cost money.
You then had to store the gold somewhere, preferably under lock and key. 
You would also have been wise to insure it. If you were buying coins, you’d 
pay a very high markup to both purchase and sell.
Such practices are now unnecessary. You can own gold without ever touch-
ing the stuff. You want to invest in the precious metal? You can buy shares 
of an exchange-traded fund online in an instant. Each share of the ETF repre-
sents a piece of gold, and the price of the share goes up and down with the 
price of gold, tit for tat, minus the expenses of the fund.
The same is true of silver. And oil. The Hunt brothers (those famous silver 
speculators from a bygone era) never had it so easy. Nor did Jed Clampett or 
J.R. Ewing.

152
Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
Whether these single-commodity funds qualify as true index funds, well, that’s 
debatable — but let’s not debate that here. I don’t advocate that most folks 
invest in individual commodities. There’s too much volatility without any way 
for you (or even the experts) to know which way that volatility will take you. 
But as for commodities as a whole — a mix of gold and silver, oil and plati-
num, pork bellies and wheat futures — yes, there is a rationale for investing in 
such a basket, and there are good index funds that make it easy to do.
Such commodity index funds are the first thing I discuss in this chapter. I 
then ask you to join me in a look at real estate — in the form of real estate 
investment trust (REIT) index funds — as another possible addition to your 
portfolio. And finally, I talk about a few index funds that are neither stocks 
nor bonds, commodities nor real estate. Such entities as a buy/write index 
and various currency indexes are truly on the fringes of index investing.
Panning for Gold with Commodity 
Investments
As I’m writing this chapter in mid-2008, gold, silver, and oil — the three most 
popular commodities for investment purposes (with the possible exception 
of Elvis dishware available on eBay) — have all seen a bull market like never 
before. In fact, the price of most commodities has gone through the ceiling, 
as evidenced in Table 9-1.

 Chapter 9: Diversifying Your Portfolio
Almost needless to say, investors have taken note, and there has been a huge 
influx of fresh capital into these commodity funds. Everyone is more than 
eager to join in the modern gold rush.
According to Morningstar figures, nearly $16 billion flowed into precious 
metal and natural resource ETFs in the past year (through April 2008). 
Compare that to the roughly $2 billion that flowed into technology ETFs! 
(Great money also poured into emerging-market stock ETFs, another cat-
egory that has done well of late). Investors are forever chasing hot sectors, 
which is a huge mistake (even among index investors).
But back to commodities . . . Will all these recent investors in commodities 
make out in the next year or two or five as well as those who were fortunate 
enough to get into the commodity game in the recent past?
There is plenty of controversy at present as to whether the recent blastoff in 
commodity prices represents a bubble (just like the tech-stock bubble of the 
late 1990s or the Dutch tulip bulb bubble of centuries prior). Some people 
argue that it instead represents a fundamental shift in the world’s demand for 
commodities (particularly due to the demands of resource-hungry nations 
like China and India) at a time when supply may be running short.
To be perfectly honest, I’m not sure. I expect there’s at least a minor bubble. 
If the prices don’t collapse, they are very unlikely to continue to climb at 
their present rate for too much longer. It may happen that commodities, if 
they do climb in price, will climb only about as fast as the general level of 
inflation. In fact, before this recent jump occurred, gold, over the past 100 
years, had done more or less just that: It didn’t reward investors in the long 
run at all; it merely kept up with inflation.
But investing in a commodity index fund, even if commodities rise in price 
only at the rate of inflation, may still make sense, in moderation. Let me 
explain why.
Protecting your portfolio from storms
I have a passion for diversification. That’s why I like commodities. Commodity 
prices and performance tend to move on their own, with very little, if any, 
correlation to stocks, bonds, real estate, or Elvis dishware. If you’re going to 
invest in something that holds its own in bad times for the major financial 
markets, commodities may be a good choice. Figure 9-1 demonstrates why.

I must take a minute to concede that not all investment advisors agree with 
me that investing in a commodity index makes sense. John Bogle, the father 
of index investing (see his Q&A in Chapter 20), doesn’t believe in commodity 
investing. Commodities, he points out, are not productive assets. Over the 
long run, he says, the growth in this index isn’t likely to be much greater, if 
greater at all, than the general level of inflation. Bogle is right (as he usually 
is). We just have a minor difference of opinion as to whether, given this fact 
of nonproductivity, commodities still deserve a spot in your portfolio.
 
Bogle says no. I say yes, but only a minor position in your portfolio should be 
devoted to commodities — ballpark 5 percent. And I further suggest that you 
hold reasonable expectations for this allotment. I believe that through regular 
rebalancing (which I discuss in-depth in Chapter 16), you can eek out a return 
slightly better than inflation. And, just as importantly, you’ll have a piece of 
your portfolio that very well may shoot up when everything else is sinking 
like, well, a brick of gold. I’m willing to accept only very modest long-term 
returns on 5 percent of my portfolio in return for that security.

155
 Chapter 9: Diversifying Your Portfolio
But I’m also not telling you that commodities are an essential part of your 
investment plan. I like the exposure to gold, silver, and oil. It isn’t necessary 
to hold them, however, to achieve a (ahem) well-oiled portfolio.
Assessing the commodity index options
Given the superlative performance of commodities — practically all com-
modities — in the months just prior to my writing this chapter, the number 
of exchange-traded products that track individual commodities or groupings 
of commodities hitting the markets has been staggering. I counted 32 total 
last, but the number will grow. Like the rest of the exchange-traded product 
market, the niches are now getting niched into nothingness. You can focus 
your investments not only on gold, silver, and oil, but also on grains, live-
stock, copper, or nickel.
 
I wouldn’t advise nickel. Or copper. Or anything that goes moo. Commodities 
are volatile enough. Choose a fund that indexes a bunch of commodities — a 
fund such as the iPath Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index Total Return ETN 
(DJP), which I describe momentarily.
In my description of this fund, please take special note of the section I call 
“Nature of the beast.” (This particular fund moos a wee bit, but that’s not 
what I’m talking about.) This fund is an exchange-traded note, which is quite 
different than the vast majority of index products.
iPath Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index Total Return ETN (DJP)
Indexed to: The Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index. The index currently is 
built of 34 percent energy (oil, natural gas), 7 percent livestock (moo), 10 
percent precious metals (gold, silver, platinum), 21 percent industrial metals 
(copper, nickel), and 28 percent agriculture (wheat, corn).
Expense ratio: 0.75 percent
Issued by: Barclays Bank PLC
Rating of issuer: S&P: AA; Moody’s: Aa1 (both indicate premium quality)
Nature of the beast (IMPORTANT!): This product looks like an ETF, but it 
is an ETN — an exchange-traded note — and there is a world of difference 
between the two. ETNs are unsecured debt obligations, sort of like bonds. 
You are actually lending Barclays your money, and the bank promises you 
a rate of return commensurate with the index, plus your principal back 
(adjusted to meet the index) when you ask for it. If Barclays were to go 
under, you’d stand to lose your money. (Not so with an ETF or index mutual 
fund.) I would recommend a product like this only if it were issued by a very 
solid company, which Barclays certainly is.

156
Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
 
If you are going to invest in this note, know that at present commodity ETNs 
are taxed quite gingerly. (This is not true of all ETNs; with currency ETNs, you 
can get IRS-clobbered.) You generally won’t pay any tax unless you sell at a 
profit and experience a capital gain. As such, this tax-efficient fund can find 
a home in your taxable account. But keep an eye on it. The IRS may change 
its initial ruling on commodity ETNs, making them less tax efficient. If that 
becomes the case, it may be time to reassess the wisdom of this fund.
Other financial instruments that allow for an indexed approach to commod-
ity investing include the iPath GSCI Total Return Index ETN (GSP) and the 
Deutsche Bank Commodity Index Tracking Fund (DBC). Of the three funds, I 
prefer DJP because it offers the greatest diversification within commodities. 
At present, no other index fund tracks a similarly diversified portfolio. I use 
DJP in my own portfolio.
Holding Property in Your Portfolio with 
Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)
Real estate investment trusts, otherwise known as REITs (rhymes with Keats, 
the poet), are companies that hold property: shopping malls, office buildings, 
hotels, healthcare centers, storage facilities, or timberland. Alternatively, 
these companies may hold certain real estate–related assets, such as com-
mercial mortgages. About 200 publicly held REITs exist in the United States. 
There are at least as many in Western Europe, Australia, and Japan.
Yes, there are various REIT indexes, and yes, you can find a good number of 
funds — both mutual funds and ETFs — that track those indexes.
REITs have caught on with investors in the past few years, mostly for the 
wrong reason. You can probably guess what that reason is: They are chasing 
high returns.
The so-called NAREIT All REIT Index has enjoyed an average annual return 
of 16.64 over the past five years. That outshines the S&P 500’s annual return 
of 10.62 percent for the same time frame. Foreign REITs have similarly done 
great guns. European REITs have seen a five-year annual average return of 
18.16, and Asian REITs, 20.88. (As is the case with most foreign investments 
over the past years, the weakening dollar and strengthening of other curren-
cies has helped to propel returns for the Yankee investor.)

157
 Chapter 9: Diversifying Your Portfolio
Will such phenomenal performance continue? Who knows? But the primary 
reason to invest in REITs (or anything else, for that matter) shouldn’t be to 
chase recent performance. Rather, the reason should be to add to your port-
folio diversification — to add a holding that is going to go up over the long 
run but not move in lockstep with the rest of your portfolio.
According to NAREIT, the National Association of Real Estate Investment 
Trusts, the correlation between the S&P 500 and the NAREIT index is less 
than 40 percent. In other words, your odds are at least 6 in 10 that if the 
broad stock market falls, your REIT holding may not . . . and vice versa. 
Figure 9-2 demonstrates this fact.

Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
Understanding the true nature of REITs
For whatever reason, REITs are very often misunderstood. So before I intro-
duce you to a few good REIT index funds, I’d like to talk about what makes 
REITs special and, in some cases, not so special:
 
✓ Ultimately, REITs are stocks. And to a certain extent, they behave as other 
stocks do. The price of REITs, and their return to investors, is subject to 
the same irrational exuberance and despair that other stocks are. We’ve 
seen some despair in the last year or so.
 
✓ REITs pay very high dividends. That’s because REITs get special tax 
status, and in exchange for that status, they are required by law to pay 
out 90 percent of their income as dividends to shareholders. Over the 
past decade or two, REITs have tended to pay dividends in the 5 to 7 
percent ballpark. In the months prior to my writing this chapter, with 
all the problems in the real estate market, those dividends have shrunk 
to about 4 to 5 percent. But that is still way higher than the 1.6 percent 
dividend being paid by a basket of S&P 500 stocks — even higher than 
the highest-paying dividend ETFs (which tend to be made up of mostly 
financial stocks), now yielding perhaps 3 percent.
 
✓ Any fund that pays high dividends is going to be not terribly tax effi-
cient. That’s especially true of REIT funds. Few, if any, REIT dividends 
qualify for the dandy 15 percent dividend tax rate. For that reason, REIT 
funds, even REIT index funds, belong in a tax-advantaged account, such 
as your IRA or 401(k).
 
✓ REITs mostly represent commercial real estate — not domestic real 
estate. But the value of REITs and the value of your home will tend to 
be somewhat related. If you have a whole lot of your personal wealth 
tied up in the value of your home (or rental properties you own), you 
may want to pass on REITs or choose to invest in foreign, not domestic, 
REIT funds. You don’t want all your eggs tied up in the value of U.S. real 
estate. As we’ve all seen in 2007 and 2008, that value can go down as 
well as up.
 
✓ Speaking of international REITs . . . They have a delightful lack of correla-
tion to all U.S. stocks, including U.S. REITs. When you think about it, real 
estate is the quintessential local economy. It involves very little interna-
tional trade, which is the primary reason that, say, large Canadian and 
European growth stocks tend to move up and down in price very closely 
with large U.S. growth stocks.

159
 Chapter 9: Diversifying Your Portfolio
 
✓ REITs comprise a sector of the stock market that tends to have limited 
correlation to the rest. That is, the market can go down, and REITs may 
hold their own. Or the market can go up, and REITs don’t, or perhaps 
they tumble. But other sectors — most notably energy, utilities, and 
consumer staples — also can have minds of their own. REITs are not 
as special as some people (including many investment professionals) 
make them out to be. Yes, I do think they belong in your portfolio as a 
separate category. But if you don’t want REITs, for whatever reason, you 
can still have a good portfolio. In fact, if you have room only in your tax-
able account, and you are in a high tax bracket, you may not want REITs. 
Ditto if you have lots of money tied up in real estate holdings.
Choosing REIT funds that 
will work best for you
 
As with all other index funds, you’re looking for an index that makes sense, 
and you’re looking for low costs. Remember that REITs pay mostly so-called 
nonqualified dividends, which means you’ll likely pay a tax on them in the year 
they roll into your account, equal to your income tax rate. For that reason, 
REIT funds can sting you on April 15. You should try to store them in a tax-
advantaged account, such as an IRA — yes, even though they are index funds, 
and you’ve heard that index funds are tax efficient!
Index mutual funds
 
Although there are several dozen REIT mutual funds, the REIT index mutual 
funds are scarce. In fact, only four of them exist. Of these, we can eliminate 
two: the Wells Dow Jones Wilshire U.S. REIT Index Fund (WDJAX) and the 
Wells Dow Jones Wilshire Global RESI Index Fund (WDGAX). These funds are 
from Wells Real Estate Funds, a company based in Norcross, Georgia (town 
motto: “Just like Wall Street, only more humid”). Both of the Wells funds bear 
loads (heavy commissions) and high expense ratios. They make no sense. You 
should never pay a load (4 percent in this case) or a high expense ratio (1.1 
percent) for an index fund. Never!
I could easily recommend the two others funds, especially the Vanguard REIT 
Index Fund (VGSIX). The Northern Global Real Estate Index Fund (NGREX) 
offers REIT holdings in both the United States and abroad.

160
Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
Vanguard REIT Index Fund (VGSIX)
Indexed to: The MSCI U.S. REIT Index, which is a free float–adjusted market 
capitalization–weighted index that represents approximately 85 percent of 
the U.S. REIT universe. Vanguard typically uses 100 REITs to replicate the 
MSCI index. (Free float–adjusted means that it includes shares held only by 
the general public and excludes those held by the controlling groups, which 
almost never trade. This is perhaps a bigger factor in REITs, which tend to be 
modest-size companies, than in most other stocks.)
Expense ratio: 0.20 percent
Average cap size: $5.8 billion
P/E ratio: 37.8
Current dividend yield: 5.6 percent
Minimum initial purchase: $3,000
Minimum initial purchase in IRA: $3,000
Top five holdings: Simon Property Group, Inc. REIT; ProLogis REIT; Vornado 
Realty Trust REIT; Boston Properties, Inc. REIT; Public Storage, Inc. REIT
Notes: With $100,000 you can move to the Admiral Class of this fund (VGSLX) — 
the very same animal as VGSIX but with a yearly fee of only 0.14 percent. Or, 
if you want the ETF version of the same fund, you can purchase the Vanguard 
REIT ETF (VNQ), which has an annual expense ratio of only 0.12 percent.
Northern Global Real Estate Fund (NGREX)
Indexed to: The FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Global Real Estate Index. (EPRA stands 
for the European Professional Realtors Association, and NAREIT stands for 
the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.) The index reflects 
the stock performance of more than 300 REITs, as well as non-REIT real 
estate companies in North America, Europe, and Asia.
Expense ratio: 0.64 percent
Average cap size: $10.5 billion
P/E ratio: 14.97
Current dividend yield: 3.60 percent
Minimum initial purchase: $2,500

 Chapter 9: Diversifying Your Portfolio
Minimum initial purchase in IRA: $500
Top five country holdings: United States, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia,

Notes: All things being equal, I’d like to see you split your REIT holdings into 
one U.S. REIT fund and one foreign. But I also don’t want to see you slicing and
 dicing your portfolio so many ways that it becomes unwieldy. So here’s a com-
promise: If you have a handsome enough portfolio — say, at least $75,000 — 
consider two REIT funds. If you have anything less than that, you’re probably 
better off with a global REIT fund that combines U.S. holdings and interna-
tional. Northern Global isn’t a bad option. Another option: the First Trust FTSE 
EPRA/NAREIT Global Real Estate Index Fund (FFR), which I discuss shortly; it’s 
an ETF, and it costs just a wee bit less than the Northern fund.
Exchange-traded funds
Unlike the world of mutual funds, the world of ETFs offers lots and lots of 
REIT funds. But as far as I’m concerned, it isn’t hard to eliminate a whole 
bunch of them that focus on narrow niches of the REIT universe. (The REIT 
universe itself is narrow enough for me!)
So, unless you happen to have a huge portfolio, I’d just forget about the REIT 
ETFs that specifically shoot to tap into mortgage REITs, residential REITs, 
retail REITs, and industrial/office REITs.
Among those I do recommend are the Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ) and the 
Dow Jones Wilshire REIT ETF (RWR) on the domestic side. And on the foreign 
side, I recommend the iShares FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Global Real Estate Ex-U.S. 
Index Fund (IFGL), as well as the SPDR DJ Wilshire International Real Estate 
ETF (RWX).
Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ)
Indexed to: The MSCI U.S. REIT Index, which is a free float–adjusted market 
capitalization–weighted index that represents approximately 85 percent of 
the U.S. REIT universe. Vanguard typically uses 100 REITs to replicate the 
MSCI index.
Expense ratio: 0.12 percent
Average cap size: $5.8 billion
P/E ratio: 37.8
Current dividend yield: 5.6 percent

Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
Top five holdings: Simon Property Group, Inc. REIT; ProLogis REIT; Vornado 
Realty Trust REIT; Boston Properties, Inc. REIT; Public Storage, Inc. REIT
Notes: This fund is the ETF share class of the Vanguard REIT Index Fund 
(VGSIX). They are identical funds, except for their structure, a minor point. 
Note that you’ll save money on the expense ratio of the ETF, but you’ll have 
to pay a small fee to buy and sell it. The tax efficiency of the ETF shouldn’t 
differ much, if at all, from the index mutual fund.
Dow Jones Wilshire REIT ETF (RWR)
Indexed to: The Dow Jones Wilshire REIT Index. State Street Global Advisors, 
the purveyors of this fund, currently use 87 REITs to represent the index of 
all U.S. REITs.
Expense ratio: 0.25 percent
Average cap size: $5.2 billion
P/E ratio: 28.1
Current dividend yield: 4.7 percent
Top five holdings: Simon Property Group, Inc. REIT; Prologis REIT; Vornado 
Realty Trust REIT; Boston Properties, Inc. REIT; Equity Residential REIT
Notes: This fund is similar enough to the Vanguard offering that the higher 
price tag makes it, in my book, an obvious second choice. It’s a good fund, 
and worthy of investing in, but only if you have some reason that I don’t 
know about to pass on the Vanguard REIT fund.
iShares FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Global Real Estate Ex-U.S. Index Fund (IFGL)
Indexed to: FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Global Real Estate Ex-U.S. Index. (EPRA 
stands for the European Professional Realtors Association, and NAREIT 
stands for the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.) 
Barclays is using 172 REITs to capture this broad index of the international 
global REIT market, which exempts all United States–based REITs.
Expense ratio: 0.48 percent
Average cap size: $7.6 billion
P/E ratio: 14.7
Current yield: 2.25 percent

163
 Chapter 9: Diversifying Your Portfolio
Top five country holdings: Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, United Kingdom, 
France
Notes: This fund, which entered the market a year after the SPDR DJ Wilshire 
International Real Estate ETF (RWX), is a little bit more economical while 
offering largely the same kind of diversification.
SPDR DJ Wilshire International Real Estate ETF (RWX)
Indexed to: The Dow Jones Wilshire ex-U.S. Real Estate Securities Index. State 
Street Global Advisors, the producers of this ETF, use 132 REITs to mirror the 
performance of this global index that includes exposure to 19 different coun-
tries, the United States not included among them.
Expense ratio: 0.60 percent
Average cap size: $6.0 billion
P/E ratio: 15.6
Current yield: 3.4 percent
Top five country holdings: Japan, Australia, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, 
France
Notes: Not a bad fund, by any means, but the iShares version costs less for 
very similar exposure.
First Trust FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Global Real Estate Index Fund (FFR)
Indexed to: The FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Global Real Estate Index. (EPRA stands 
for the European Professional Realtors Association, and NAREIT stands for 
the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.) The index reflects 
the stock performance of more than 300 REITs, as well as non-REIT real 
estate companies in North America, Europe, and Asia. First Trust uses almost 
all 300 REITs to replicate the index.
Expense ratio: 0.60 percent
Average cap size: $10.5 billion
P/E ratio: 14.97
Current dividend yield: 3.60 percent
Top five country holdings: United States, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, 
United Kingdom

164
Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
Notes: All things being equal, I’d like to see you split your REIT holdings into 
one U.S. REIT fund and one foreign. But I also don’t want to see you slicing 
and dicing your portfolio so many ways that it becomes hard to manage. So 
here’s a compromise: If you have a chunky enough portfolio — say, at least 
$75,000 — consider two separate REIT funds. If you have anything less than 
that magic number, go with a global REIT fund that combines U.S. holdings 
and international. This First Trust fund is a good option.
Knowing how much to invest in REITs
I can’t give you an exact percentage. The optimal allocation of REITs in 
your portfolio depends on a number of factors, including how much of your 
personal wealth is tied up in non-portfolio real estate (your home, rental 
properties, and so on) and how much space you have in your tax-advantaged 
accounts. (You need room in there for other tax-inefficient funds, like most 
bond funds.) I’ll get personal in Part III and try to address these questions 
specifically. For now, let me throw out just a few rough guidelines:
 
✓ For most folks, 10 to 20 percent of your total equity holdings might be 
in REITs. Let’s split the numerical baby and say 15 percent would be a 
good starting point.
 
✓ I would divide that up so that roughly 15 percent of your domestic stock 
holdings are in domestic REITs, and 15 percent of your foreign holdings 
are in foreign REITs. (Thus, if you have a portfolio of 75 percent stocks, 
and 60 percent of that is domestic, your U.S. REIT allocation may be 
6.75 percent [75 × 60 × 15 percent] of your total portfolio. Your foreign 
REIT allocation may be 4.5 percent [75 × 40 × 15 percent] of your total 
portfolio.)
A lot of people assume that their U.S. REITs and their foreign REITs will show 
similar patterns of performance. Uh-uh. Largely because of exchange rates, 
your foreign REITs are more likely to perform similarly to your other foreign 
stocks than they are to your U.S. REITs.
 
Go with those REIT funds, both U.S. and foreign, based on the broadest 
indexes (such the funds I introduce in this chapter). Avoid the niche areas, 
such as mortgage REITs and retail REITs, unless you have a fat portfolio (more 
than, say, half a million) and could really stand to benefit from huge diversifi-
cation. I generally prefer traditional cap-weighted indexes to the newfangled 
fundamental indexes. Avoid like the plague the Ultra Real Estate ProShares 
fund (URE) and the UltraShort Real Estate ProShares fund (SRS) — such lever-
aged and inverse ETFs are more tools of speculation than investments.

165
 Chapter 9: Diversifying Your Portfolio
Investing — or Not — in Some 
Truly Unorthodox Indexes
The explosion of exchange-traded products in the past several years has not 
only led to a great number of new ways for index investors to tap into the 
stock, bond, commodity, and REIT markets; it has also stretched into areas 
where few investors — index or otherwise — have ever ventured. There’s no 
compelling reason that I’ve found to venture into these areas, and the fact 
that they are now indexed doesn’t in itself create a compelling reason. Hold 
onto your seat — whoooeeee! — while I take you on a quick tour of currency 
indexes, as well as indexes of preferred stock, covered calls, and private equity.
Cashing in on currency quackery
As every international traveler knows (as well as buyers of French cheeses, 
Italian wines, and BMWs), the U.S. dollar has plummeted vis-à-vis most for-
eign currencies. On October 26, 2000, the U.S. dollar was at a high water 
mark, and it could buy you 1.21 Euros. By April 22, 2008, a greenback would 
get you only 0.62 Euros. On January 18, 2002, the U.S. dollar could get you 
1.61 in Canadian dollars. By November 7, 2007, cashing in that same U.S. 
dollar would get you only a lousy 92 Canadian cents.
And that, dear reader, is why there are now dozens and dozens of currency 
ETFs, each linked to an index of various sorts. People are thinking, “Hey, 
if the dollar keeps falling, and if I index my investments to some other cur-
rency, I’ll get rich!” But that isn’t going to happen. If the U.S. dollar keeps 
falling at the rate it has been, in another few years, an average Canadian 
plumber would be able to work an extra weekend, saunter across his south-
ern border, and buy the state of Vermont. Look again. Currency fluctuations 
work both ways! They always have.
I’m not even sure that these currency ETFs qualify as index investing. But 
they’re being advertised as index funds, and most people think (rightfully so) 
that ETFs are index funds, so I suppose I need to comment both on the funds 
and the advertisements. (Note to advertisers: You aren’t going to like what 
follows.)
One such advertisement, for WisdomTree Dreyfus Currency Income ETFs, 
reads, “Your stocks and bonds have gone international. Why not your cash?” 
I’ll tell you why not: Because cash should be kept as cash! Cash is meant to 
be spent in the present or in the near future. It isn’t supposed to be gambled 
with. Stocks and bonds are where you expect to see return (and deal with 
risk) — not cash! The price you pay for the WisdomTree ETFs — 0.45 percent 

166
Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
a year — is going to drain whatever meager interest you make on the cash. 
And the currency fluctuation is just as likely to work against you as for you. 
That’s why your cash should not go international.
Oh, one more reason: If you have foreign stocks and bonds (which you should) 
then you already have exposure to foreign currencies — probably too much!
The WisdomTree Dreyfus Currency Income ETFs — such as the WisdomTree 
Dreyfus Brazilian Real Fund (BZF), the WisdomTree Dreyfus Chinese Yuan 
Fund (CYB), and the WisdomTree Dreyfus Indian Rupee Fund (ICN) — are 
very short-term debt funds (sort of like foreign-denominated money mar-
kets). Some of the other currency index ETFs, such as the CurrencyShares 
(Rydex) lineup of ETFs, are a bit different in structure but offer the same 
promise. Funds like the CurrencyShares Mexican Peso Trust (FXM) and the 
CurrencyShares British Pound Sterling Trust (FXB) charge 0.40 percent a 
year and promise to make you money only if the U.S. dollar continues to drop 
vis-à-vis the currency you choose.
PowerShares has also jumped onto the currency bandwagon with its 
PowerShares DB U.S. Dollar Index Bullish Fund (UUP) and — for real contrar-
ian index investors — the PowerShares DB U.S. Dollar Index Bearish Fund 
(UDN), each with an expense ratio of 0.55 percent. Barclays is in the game, 
too. You can buy exchange-traded notes the likes of the iPath EUR/USD 
Exchange Rate ETN (ERO) or the iPath GBP/USD Exchange Rate ETN (GBB), 
each with a yearly expense of 0.40 percent. Unlike the commodity-based 
ETNs I discuss earlier in this chapter, these babies are not tax efficient at all. 
And you take the same (minor, but real) default risk that you do with bonds 
but not ETFs. I like Barclays. A lot. I dislike these particular funds. A lot.
 
I’m not saying that the currency funds don’t make any sense in any circum-
stance for any person. They make a lot of sense for the people selling them! 
They may also make sense for certain institutional buyers and very sophisti-
cated financial types (exporters, importers, international bankers) who need 
currency hedges for various reasons. For a typical buy-and-hold individual 
investor, especially a smart index investor who demands rhyme and reason to 
his investments, they make no sense. They’ll make you no cents. Or pesos. Or 
yen. Or whatever. Over the long run, these currency plays will only bite you 
on the derriere. Stay away.
Doing like the rich: Investing 
in private equity (sort of)
The term private equity brings to mind caviar, yacht clubs, and toy poodles 
with pedicures. Private equity means just what it sounds like: ownership 
in a business interest that is not publicly traded, most typically very small 

167
 Chapter 9: Diversifying Your Portfolio
start-up companies. There’s often great risk but potentially great return. 
Some legendary hedge fund managers have made billions with their private 
equity deals. (Clarification: They’ve made billions for themselves, and typi-
cally much less for their investors.) How do you turn private equity into an 
investment for the unwashed masses? And, even trickier, how do you index 
such a thing? The folks from PowerShares say they’ve found a way with the 
PowerShares Listed Private Equity ETF (PSP).
Note the word “Listed.” That’s the alleged trick. “The PowerShares Listed 
Private Equity Portfolio seeks to replicate the Red Rocks Listed Private 
Equity Index, which includes over 30 U.S. publicly listed companies with 
direct investments in more than 1,000 private businesses,” says the 
PowerShares brochure. (The Red Rocks literature says “30 to 50” companies. 
Who knows?) In other words, you’re getting in through the back door. Or 
maybe the side door. I’m not sure. You’re investing in mud flaps by buying a 
truck, investing in toothpicks by buying a lumber company. Hmmm . . .
It’s a novel idea, and it promises great return. In fact, the Red Rocks index 
has a reported ten-year return of 14.64, which clobbers the return of the S&P 
500 (5.9 percent), as the PowerShares literature makes abundantly clear. But 
is that a fair comparison? The companies that make up the Red Rocks Listed 
Private Equity Index are, by and large, small and mid cap value companies. 
The return on small value over the past ten years: 13.80. The cost of the 
PowerShares ETF: 0.60 percent a year. So even if the future is as kind to these 
companies as was the past (and that’s a huge question), the cost of this fund, 
considerably more than you’d pay for a typical small or mid cap value ETF, 
may be enough to wash out any advantage.
This is a novel idea, and I give PowerShares lots of credit for creativity, but I 
don’t see PSP as a terribly good choice for your portfolio.
Making a preference for preferred stock
Preferred stock is often described (accurately enough) as something of a 
cross between a stock and a bond. Preferred stocks pay high dividends (usu-
ally taxed more delicately than bond interest). And some preferred stock 
(convertible preferred) offers an opportunity for considerable price apprecia-
tion, like a common stock, sort of. Generally speaking, preferred stock offers 
a return potential higher than bonds but lower than common stock. It is 
riskier than bonds but less risky than stocks.
Does preferred stock make sense? I’m not a huge fan. Why not instead invest in 
stocks and bonds, and create a hybrid portfolio? To me, that makes more sense. 
But some people (those with a dividend fetish, mostly) really like preferred 
stock. They could do worse, I suppose. Until recently there was no way for an 

168
Part II: Getting to Know Your Index Fund Choices 
index investor to touch preferred stock, but all that has changed with the advent 
of exchange-traded products. Two ETFs now attempt to mirror the performance 
of indexes created to track the market performance of preferred stock:
 
✓ The iShares S&P U.S. Preferred Stock Index Fund (PFF) has an expense 
ratio of 0.48 percent and a current yield of 6.6 percent. (Don’t confuse 
yield with return! This fund, as I’m typing this paragraph in May 2008, 
is showing a three-year annualized return of only 0.5 percent; that’s 
because the price of the shares had tumbled.)
 
✓ The PowerShares Preferred Fund (PGX) tracks the Merrill Lynch Fixed 
Rate Preferred Securities Index Fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.50 per-
cent and a current yield (for what that’s worth) of 7.3 percent.
There you have it. They are available. But I’m not urging you to buy.
Covering calls with the buy/write index
Perhaps the most innovative, unusual, and exotic of all ETFs uses something 
called a covered call strategy in hopes of capturing good returns with mini-
mal risk. I am intrigued with this strategy, for sure, but I don’t think it’s quite 
ready for primetime just yet.
In a covered call strategy, you, the investor, buy a certain stock, and then you 
write call options (which are “covered” because you actually own the stock), 
allowing someone else the option to buy the stock at a set price at a certain 
time. That someone else pays you a premium for that right. In most cases, 
especially when the markets are relatively flat, the options expire, and the 
writers of the options make good money off the premiums. When the markets 
are shooting up, however, writers of call options don’t fare as well, as they 
tend to lose their appreciating shares.
So far, so good? The folks from Barclays and PowerShares have created a way 
to index covered calls, in which you buy shares of the S&P 500 and then write 
calls on a regular, systematic basis.
In theory, the process works well. The index, when backtested, shows aver-
age annual returns of five and ten years only a tad less than the S&P 500, with 
only about two-thirds the volatility. Who knows if that’s the way it will work 
in the next five to ten years. But even if the strategy does work, is it such a 
great thing? You can accomplish pretty much the same objective, I feel, by 
adding 20 percent or so bonds to your stock portfolio. And you can do it for 
less money than the two buy/write exchange-traded products, both of which 
charge a fairly hefty annual fee of 0.75 percent.

169
 Chapter 9: Diversifying Your Portfolio
The PowerShares product is called the PowerShares S&P 500 Buy/Write fund 
(PBP), and the Barclays product is called the iPath CBOE S&P 500 BuyWrite 
ETN. I encourage you to wait a few years before investing in either of these 
products to see if the performance in the real world matches that of the 
backtested index returns. You may be surprised. I may be surprised! If you 
absolutely must go for one or the other sooner, I’d choose the PowerShares 
option — the ETF rather than the ETN — and I’d stick it into a tax-advantaged 
account.

Drawing a 
Blueprint for Your 
Index Portfolio

In this part . . .
T
o your left (the first two parts of this book), you find 
the tools and the building blocks with which an index 
investor works. It all starts with good, low-cost index 
funds based on reasonable indexes. To your right (this 
part of the book), you find out how to use those tools and 
building blocks to construct the optimal portfolio.
In Chapter 10, for example, you discover the best broker-
age houses where index funds may be purchased. I then 
guide you through the all-important allocation questions: 
How much should you have in stocks? In bonds? In cash? I 
help you understand that the right allocation for you and 
the best index funds for you are very individual matters. 
Finally, in Chapter 15, I present you with sample portfo-
lios. Use them as starting points for drawing up your 
personal portfolio blueprint.

W
hen you shop for food, you can go to the farmer’s market and buy 
directly from the source. That would be akin to buying an index mutual 
fund directly from a mutual fund company. Or, you can do like the masses and 
buy your food at the supermarket. That would be similar to buying an index 
mutual fund or exchange-traded fund through a retail brokerage house (such 
as a Charles Schwab, Fidelity, or T. Rowe Price), which is sometimes called, 
aptly enough, a financial supermarket.
Going to the farmer’s market (or the mutual fund company) directly may 
have a few advantages, but supermarkets can be awfully convenient.
In this chapter, I compare and contrast the two ways for you to buy an index 
fund: either directly from a mutual fund company, or through a financial 
supermarket. (With mutual funds, you have a choice. But with exchange-
traded funds, you must go through the intermediary; you generally cannot 
buy an ETF directly from the source.) Some mutual fund companies and 
financial supermarkets are friendlier to small investors than others. Some 
offer special sweet deals on new accounts. Some are better suited to meet the 
specific needs of index investors.
I can’t say I’ve had intimate relationships with every mutual fund company 
and brokerage house in America, but I do have enough experience to pass on 
a few words of wisdom to make your shopping easier. These shopping point-
ers, along with a few tips about negotiating the best deals with brokerage 
houses, form the bulk of this informative chapter.

174
Part III: Drawing a Blueprint for Your Index Portfolio 
Knowing What’s Important 
and What’s Not
As an index investor, you have special needs and desires, hopes and dreams. 
(Oh, you weren’t aware?) For example, it hardly makes sense to own low-
cost index funds if you’re going to pay a small fortune to buy and sell them. 
You don’t need stock-picking or market-timing advice, thank you, and you 
certainly don’t want to pay for it. Perhaps most of all, you need access to the 
best selection of index funds available.
Additional considerations:
 
✓ How knowledgeable and friendly is the staff?
 
✓ Do you get to a staffer by second or third ring, or are you put through 
voicemail hell and connected intercontinentally to someone on a fuzzy 
phone line who seems half asleep?
 
✓ What kind of return do you get in your cash (money market) account?
 
✓ Does the financial supermarket help you to keep track of your capital 
gains, or are you on your own to do that onerous task?
 
✓ Can you reinvest your dividends and interest payments automatically, 
at no cost?
 
✓ How user-friendly or tech-scratchy is the Web site interface?
 
So many questions . . . It’s hard to pick the best brokerage house. But I will 
say right off the bat that as an index investor, you want a discount broker-
age house such as Fidelity, Vanguard, Charles Schwab, T. Rowe Price, TD 
Ameritrade, Zecco, or ShareBuilder (run by ING Direct).
 
As an index investor, you do not need a full-service brokerage house with full-
service prices and hungry salespeople in expensive suits who call themselves 
“advisors” and try to convince you to trade often. You don’t need a Morgan 
Stanley, a Smith Barney, a Merrill Lynch, or a UBS. Their prices are high, their 
advice is unnecessary, their 50-page colorful performance reports are ridicu-
lously devoid of any important information, and if they have their own index 
funds, those funds generally stink. (Sorry if I sound a bit opinionated, but I 
really am speaking the truth here!)
Sorting through apples and oranges
Among the discount brokerage houses, you’ll find considerable differences in 
everything from service to price. Unfortunately, just as when you buy tires or 
mattresses, it can sometimes be difficult to compare and contrast.

175
 Chapter 10: Finding a Happy Home for Your Money 
Fidelity and Schwab, for example, charge you different prices for purchasing 
an ETF online versus on the phone. They may charge you different prices 
depending on how much money you have in your account and how often you 
trade. Zecco, in many cases, will charge you nothing to place a trade for an 
ETF, but you’re going to have to pay to buy a mutual fund. Vanguard issues 
different phone numbers to different customers . . . the richer customers 
get somewhat richer service. T. Rowe Price, which has excellent service all 
around, charges slightly higher fees for its index funds than do other major 
discount brokers, but the minimum balances tend to be considerably less.
The largest of the brokerage houses — Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab, T. Rowe 
Price — issue their own index mutual funds, and they all make it easier, natu-
rally, for you to buy their own brand rather than one of their competitor’s 
products. Buying and selling from the home team is usually free.
Despite all these many considerations, there is a brokerage house (or a com-
bination of brokerage houses) best for you. Don’t despair — I’ll help you to 
find it!
Allowing your specific investments 
to guide you
If you’re new to index investing, you need to determine whether you are 
going to build an indexed portfolio out of mutual funds, exchange-traded 
funds, or a combination of the two.
 
If you are going the pure mutual fund route, I don’t think you can do better 
than to open an account with Vanguard. Vanguard started index investing. 
Vanguard has the largest selection and the lowest-cost mutual funds of any 
brokerage house. Of course, you can buy Vanguard funds at just about any 
financial supermarket, but you often have to pay to do so. Fidelity, for exam-
ple, typically charges $75 to buy a Vanguard fund. (Vanguard and Fidelity, like 
the Army and Navy teams, don’t tend to like each other very much.)
If you’re going with a pure or predominantly ETF portfolio, your consider-
ations change. Unlike a mutual fund, an ETF — any ETF (Vanguard, Barclays, 
ProShares, State Street) — can be purchased and held at any brokerage 
house. There is generally no advantage to holding an ETF with the home team.
Because ETFs trade just like stocks, you pay the usual commission to trade 
stocks. That commission, provided you make the trade online, should run 
you no more than $20 or so. If you are a buy-and-hold investor with lots of 
bucks, the fee will obviously matter less than if you are a frequent trader or if 
your portfolio is still in the four figures.

176
Part III: Drawing a Blueprint for Your Index Portfolio 
Choosing the Financial Supermarket 
That Best Meets Your Needs
In this section, I help you choose among the discount brokerage firms by 
highlighting some of the personality quirks that make each one distinct.
The Vanguard Group
One can only speculate where index investing would be, or if it would even 
exist, if it weren’t for Vanguard. Vanguard was founded by John Bogle (who 
participates in a Q&A session with me in Chapter 20). It was founded specifi-
cally as an index shop, and today that remains its main focus. In addition 
to Vanguard’s 29 index mutual funds (and many more ETFs), it also offers 
actively managed funds, but the actively managed funds are very index-like 
(meaning low cost, low turnover).
Is it safe to put all your money 
into one brokerage house?
After the chaos surrounding Bear Stearns and 
Lehman Brothers (once two of America’s most 
prestigious brokerage houses) and the sub-
prime mortgage crisis, you may wonder if stor-
ing all your index funds under one roof is a good 
idea. Know that U.S.-based brokerage houses 
are required by Congress to be insured by the 
Securities Investor Protection Corporation 
(SIPC). The SIPC, in turn, regulates the broker-
age houses, making sure that your funds are 
kept separate from the brokers’ own funds 
and securities (including all those subprime 
mortgage contracts). If the broker should go 
belly up, as brokers do from time to time, your 
stock or bond funds should remain intact. They 
remain yours to transfer to another institution. 
In a worst-case scenario, the SIPC will protect 
you up to $500,000.
Since the SIPC was founded in 1970, a number 
of brokerage bankruptcies have occurred. The 
SIPC estimates that “no fewer than 99 percent 
of persons who are eligible have been made 
whole” in such cases.
Most large brokerage houses carry supple-
mental insurance that will protect you well 
beyond that half-million covered by the SIPC. 
(TD Ameritrade carries enough insurance 
through Lloyd’s of London to insure each client 
account up to $150 million; Zecco carries insur-
ance to protect each client up to $35 million.) 
For more information, check out the SIPC Web 
site: www.sipc.org. If you have more than 
$500,000 in your portfolio, you may want to ask 
a prospective broker about supplemental insur-
ance it carries.

177
 Chapter 10: Finding a Happy Home for Your Money 
If you are going to invest in index mutual funds, you’ll find none better 
than Vanguard’s. If you house them at Vanguard, you will save yourself the 
transaction costs that just about any other firm will charge you. (That could 
be $10 at Zecco or $75 at Fidelity.) It makes sense. To buy and sell ETFs, 
Vanguard tends to charge more than some of the other discount brokers — 
$20 per online trade, for most folks.
Founded: 1975
Assets under management: $1.5 trillion
Number of proprietary index mutual funds: 29
Best features: Way more index funds, and better index funds, than most 
other major brokerage houses. Also, the customer service people are index-
oriented. You will never be encouraged to make quick trades or time the 
market. None of Vanguard’s funds — index and active — charges a load (a 
sales fee). If you’re going to mix and match active and index investing (as I 
discuss in Chapter 13), Vanguard active funds are among the best you’ll find 
anywhere. Yields on Vanguard cash and near-cash (short-term bond) funds 
tend to be the highest available.
The Vanguard conversion gig
The Vanguard Growth Index Fund (VIGRX) and 
the Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) are, technically 
speaking, different classes of the same fund. 
Same thing for the Vanguard European Stock 
Index Fund (VEURX) and the Vanguard Europe 
Stock ETF (VGK). Why should you, technically 
speaking, give half a hoot? Because Vanguard, 
like no other purveyor of either mutual funds 
or ETFs, allows you to switch from the mutual 
fund to the ETF. It will cost you $50 to make the 
conversion. Again, you can only do this with 
Vanguard funds; the firm actually has a patent 
that gives it a monopoly on this kind of swap-
out deal.
Doing the conversion can save you from having 
to pay capital gains tax on a mutual fund that 
you may have held for years. And by moving 
from, say, the Vanguard Growth Index Fund 
to the Vanguard Growth ETF, you’ll be saving 
money in the long run: The mutual fund charges 
0.22 percent a year in operating fees, and the 
ETF charges only 0.11 percent. So if your bal-
ance is $20,000, you’ll save (0.22 – 0.11 = 0.11 
percent) $22 per year. You’ll have your payoff in 
a little over two years.
Caveat: If you have $100,000 or more in the 
Vanguard Growth Index Fund, you can qualify 
for the Vanguard Growth Admiral share class 
of the mutual fund and pay only 0.10 percent 
a year. As a rule, therefore, I’d say you should 
consider conversion of any individual Vanguard 
mutual fund in which you have more than 
$20,000 but less than $80,000. (The $80,000, in 
a good market, could become $100,000 in little 
time.) Be aware that the conversion process 
works only one way; you can’t convert back 
from an ETF to a Vanguard mutual fund, except 
by cashing out of the ETF, which could result 
in a tax hit.

Part III: Drawing a Blueprint for Your Index Portfolio 
Worst features: If you go the ETF route, the trading costs will tend to be sev-
eral dollars higher than with most other brokerage houses. Vanguard is also 
second rate where it comes to tax reporting on capital gains; I find myself 
having to call them every April, which I never have to do with Fidelity. And, 
if you have mutual funds and ETFs, your Vanguard statements will come 
broken in two, which is a bit of a pain to keep straight.

Fidelity Investments
Fidelity is huge, but the company has been able to keep its commitment to 
decent service. Although it boasts less than half the number of index funds 
as its top competitor, Vanguard, the index funds that Fidelity does offer are 
pretty good. Lately (in an effort to steal away clients from Vanguard, I’m 
sure), Fidelity has been lowering the fees on its index funds. It now boasts 
some of the lowest-cost index funds to be found.
I use Fidelity quite a bit. I like the Web site interface. The statements are 
readable. The tax reporting is excellent. The price of trades (for ETFs, for 
example) is fair but varies depending on how much you have invested. For 
most folks, it’s $10.95 per online trade, although Fidelity can be very gener-
ous (especially if prompted to be) in awarding free trades to new account 
holders. The company also runs specials from time to time, whereby you can 
get goodies, like free airline miles, for every trade you make.
Founded: 1946
Assets under management: $1.5 trillion
Number of proprietary index mutual funds: 11
Best features: Fidelity’s funds network is among the largest in the business. 
There’s no problem building an entire portfolio at Fidelity. Its own index 
funds are extremely low cost and sensible. And its money-market funds are 
among the highest paying in the industry. Customer service is available 24/7, 
even on Christmas Day, which few, if any, other brokerage houses offer.

 Chapter 10: Finding a Happy Home for Your Money 
Worst features: Only some of the non-Fidelity funds in the company’s fund 
network can be purchased without a transaction fee. If you buy a mutual fund 
outside of the Fidelity universe, you’re going to pay a pretty penny: $75 to 
purchase most Vanguard mutual funds, for example.
Special deals: The cost of Fidelity trades is based on the amount of money 
you have in your household account. I have found some, but not all, Fidelity 
reps to be quite liberal when it comes to defining “household.” Argue, for 
example, that you and your parents, or you and your brother, are very close 
and share many financial matters. You may just luck out.

Charles Schwab
As the original discount brokerage house, Schwab (“Talk to Chuck”) had lost 
its way for a while, charging too much. Lately, however, prices have dropped, 
and most folks will now spend $12.95 for an online trade of a stock or ETF.
Founded: 1971
Assets under management: $1.4 trillion
Number of proprietary index mutual funds: 15
Best features: If you have a minor child who has job income and wants to 
open a Roth IRA (a great idea!), Schwab is the only major brokerage I’ve found 
that will allow you to do so.
Worst features: Others may disagree, but I find Schwab’s Web site extremely 
clunky. “Chuck” also took a big black eye in 2008 when its YieldPlus fund, sold 
to the public as a cash-like investment, tumbled by more than a third. Schwab 
is currently being sued by angry investors, many of whom, if they could get 
Chuck on the phone, might have some rather ugly words to share with the guy.

T. Rowe Price
The Baltimore-based financial supermarket clearly positions itself as an ally 
to the small investor. Reps tend to be very friendly (they seem almost lonely 
at times) and well trained at avoiding jargon. The index mutual funds have 
lower minimum investments ($2,500 for taxable accounts; $1,000 for IRAs) 
than most brokerage houses require.

Opening an account and placing trades
Opening a mutual fund account is usually done 
by sending a check or wiring money to an insti-
tution, and filling out a bunch of forms. After the 
institution gets your money, you’re sent confir-
mation that you are now the proud owner of X 
shares of the ABC Mutual Fund. Nothing could 
be simpler.
When buying an exchange-traded fund, you 
have to first set up your account by filling out all 
the necessary forms. Then you transfer money 
to the brokerage house. Finally, you place an 
order to buy — either by phone or online. Do it 
online! It will always be cheaper.
There are two basic ways to place an order for 
an ETF: You can place a market order or a limit 
order. A market order places your bid on the 
market, and you get the best available price at 
the moment you place the bid. A limit order is 
a more conservative way to go: You place an 
order to buy, say, 100 shares of an ETF at $30.10 
a share. If someone, somewhere is willing to 
sell you 100 shares at that price, you’ll have 
your purchase. If no one is willing to sell at that 
price, you won’t get your purchase.
Which is better? In most cases, for a buy-and-
hold investor purchasing an ETF for a long-term 
investment, I’d say that you should simply place 
a market order. I would recommend that you do 
so after the market has been open for at least 
half an hour (after 10 a.m. Wall Street time). 
Don’t place your market order after 3:30 p.m. 
(The market closes at 4:00 p.m.) The markets 
can be jumpy at the beginning and end of the 
trading day. You’re more likely to get a fair price 
at some point in between.

Zecco
Zecco — which stands for “Zero Commission Cost” — allows you ten free ETF 
(or stock) trades a month, provided you maintain a total account balance 
of $2,500 or more. If your balance falls under that amount or you exceed ten 
trades in a month, the price per trade is $4.50. A buy-and-hold index investor 
with a fair-sized portfolio isn’t going to save a fortune, percentage-wise, going 
with Zecco over another discount broker. But the smaller investor with total 
assets of $2,500 to $25,000 may do well with Zecco.

Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA)
Arguably, Dimensional discovered “fundamental” indexing that is now sud-
denly so popular. Using scads of historical data, the founders of Dimensional 
reckoned a long time ago that leaning a portfolio toward value and small cap 
may bring better long-term performance, and they structured their index 
funds accordingly, using their own proprietary indexes rather than the S&P 
500 and such. So far, Dimensional funds’ real-world performance has been 
quite extraordinary.
Founded: 1981
Assets under management: $160 billion
Number of proprietary index mutual funds: 54 (Morningstar categorizes 
most of these as active funds, not index funds; I disagree.)

 Chapter 10: Finding a Happy Home for Your Money 
Best features: Very smart indexes, packaged in funds by very smart people.
Worst features: Dimensional funds are mid-priced when compared with other 
index funds. And you can’t buy them unless you’re an institution or you go 
through a fee-only registered investment advisor. As such, Dimensional funds 
make sense only to people with fair amounts of money (at least $300,000) 
who can find a really good investment advisor willing to work for a reason-
able fee. I discuss where you may find such a bird in Chapter 17.

What, No Index Funds in Your 401(k)?
Most company retirement plans are chosen by the human resources depart-
ment. Most human resources people know no more about investments than I 
know about the ancient artists of Uzbekistan.
I’ve seen 401(k) plans so bad, with such pitiful choices of investments, that 
it would be a miracle if any of the participants in the plan will ever be able to 
retire. (Hey, maybe that’s what the boss wants!) If your 401(k) plan has no 
index funds — only expensive actively run funds with horrible track records — 
you may want to cry, and I couldn’t blame you. Do know, however, that human 
resource people are amenable to being educated.
 
Hand the folks in your personnel department a copy of this book, and let 
them know that good retirement plans that offer low-cost index funds — both 
mutual funds and ETFs — are available!

184
Part III: Drawing a Blueprint for Your Index Portfolio 
Your HR people can contact Vanguard, Fidelity, or T. Rowe Price — all three 
companies can set up 401(k) plans with index options. (Contact information 
can be found earlier in this chapter.) Another good bet is to contact Invest n 
Retire by checking out www.investnretire.com or calling 503-419-2894.
Rolling Over Your Retirement Plan
If you leave your present job to take another job, you will have the option, 
in most cases, of rolling your existing 401(k) into either your new company 
401(k) or an IRA. In most cases, you’ll be better off rolling the entire bundle 
into an IRA. When the money is in an IRA, you can invest in index funds, and 
nothing but — the investment decisions will be all yours.
 
The rules for a 401(k) and a traditional IRA are the same: You can’t touch the 
money until you are 591/2, unless you care to pay taxes and a penalty; and you 
must start taking the money out when you turn 701/2. Roth IRAs (which get you 
no tax deduction when you put the money in, but incur no taxes when you 
take the money out) do not obligate you to ever take distributions.
Here’s a handful of things to be careful of before you transfer your retirement 
hoard:
 
✓ Transfer the money directly into your IRA so the IRS doesn’t get the 
impression that you are cashing out of your retirement plan, at which 
point they may want to tax and fine you.
 
✓ If you think you ever may want to roll the money back into a company 
401(k), keep the transferred money in a separate IRA and don’t mingle 
it with any other funds. I’m not sure why you would want to do this, but 
perhaps keeping the option open isn’t a bad idea.
 
✓ If you believe that someone may someday sue your pants off for any 
reason, know that 401(k) plans are federally protected from lawsuits. 
IRAs may or may not be; it depends on the state in which you live.
 
✓ If you have company stock in your current 401(k), know that you may be 
giving up some very positive tax benefits by liquidating that stock. You 
may want to speak with a financial professional before disinvesting.

O
ne of the great unsung virtues of index investing is its predictability, 
at least compared to active investing. Mind you, I’m not saying that 
index investing is entirely predictable — only that it is, especially in the long 
term, much more predictable than some other kinds of investing. By putting 
together a mix of largely index funds, you can fine-tune your portfolio (as 
much as a portfolio can ever be fine-tuned) to just the right degree of aggres-
siveness or conservatism.
Do you want a high-rolling, risk-be-damned, poised-for-prosperity portfolio? 
(Hint: You may want to buy some stock index funds.) Or do you want a 
tried-and-true, tortoise-paced, can’t-lose-too-much-but-probably-won’t-gain-
too-much portfolio? (Hint: Think bond index funds and money-market funds.)
Unsure which kind of portfolio you want? This chapter helps you to deter-
mine just that.

186
Part III: Drawing a Blueprint for Your Index Portfolio 
Understanding Asset Allocation
The single largest determinant in whether you can expect stomach-churning 
volatility in your portfolio (but potentially very sweet returns) is the percent 
of the portfolio you have in stocks and the percent you have in bonds.
 
Stocks, which represent ownership in companies, rock when it comes to long-
term returns. But the ups and downs can be extreme, and sometimes, if not 
handled with care, the volatility can be devastating. Bonds, which represent 
money you lend to either companies or the government, tend to provide 
modest returns but limited volatility.
Over the past 80 or so years, the nominal (preinflation) return on bonds has 
been about half that of stocks (roughly 5 percent average annual return for 
bonds versus 10 percent for stocks). After inflation, bonds have yielded more 
like one-third the return of stocks. After inflation and taxes (bonds are gener-
ally taxed more harshly than stocks), bonds have yielded about one-quarter 
as much as stocks.
But the nominal value of bonds rarely goes down, and if it does, not by much. 
Stocks, on the other hand, have seen periods in which they’ve lost half their 
value in a bear market; see Table 11-1. The value of cash — money-market 
accounts, savings accounts, CDs — doesn’t change at all on paper, but over 
time, it can be eaten away severely by inflation.

In general, money invested that you aren’t going to need to touch for the very 
long run — at least several years (I get more specific later in the chapter) — 
should be invested mostly in stock index funds. Shorter-term money needs are 
best invested in less volatile investments, like bond index funds and money-
market funds.

187
 Chapter 11: Developing Your Broad Investment Goals
Setting basic parameters 
for a sensible portfolio
There are, alas, no simple formulas to tell you what percent of your portfolio 
is best put in stocks and what percent in bonds and cash. You will, of course, 
hear talk of all sorts of simple formulas. A popular one tells you to subtract 
your age from 100, or your age from 110, and that’s what you should have in 
stocks. Pay (almost) no attention to such formulas! Age is but one of many 
determinants you should use to get to your optimal asset allocation — and 
by far not the most important one.
Before I delve into the nitty-gritty, however, know that I am a strong advocate 
of diversification, and I can foresee almost no circumstances where an inves-
tor would want all stock or all bonds (or all of any one investment of any 
kind, for that matter).
 
The most aggressive of aggressive portfolios should still have some bonds; the 
most conservative of conservative portfolios should still have some stocks. 
For most folks, I would use 60/40 (60 percent equity, 40 percent bonds) as a 
good default position.
 
Studies — lots of them — show that a 60/40 portfolio, more than perhaps any 
other kind of portfolio, is apt to persevere in both good times and bad, to hold 
its own against both inflation and market turbulence. It is a very good default 
position from which to begin tweaking your portfolio to the left or to the right.
Viewing asset teamwork in action
A portfolio that contains different kinds of assets (stocks, bonds, cash, pos-
sibly real estate and commodities) is the strongest of portfolios. That’s 
because stocks and bonds (and commodities and real estate) tend to zig and 
zag and sometimes zog: When one goes down, the others (not always, but 
much of the time) may go up or at least hold their own. This lack of correla-
tion is what good diversification is all about.
Diversification among asset classes keeps your portfolio on a more even keel. 
It also allows for effective regular rebalancing. Every year or so, you can sell 
off whatever asset is up and buy whatever is down. By so doing, you’ll be 
continually buying low and selling high, which over the course of many years 
will likely juice your total average annual returns by 0.5 to 1.5 percentage 
points. The rebalancing bonus will depend on how often you rebalance and 
how good your diversification is.

188
Part III: Drawing a Blueprint for Your Index Portfolio 
Beyond these diversification basics, stocks, bonds, and cash play different 
essential roles in a diversified nest egg.
Stocks: Your primary engine for growth
Over the past 80 years, stocks have gained about 10 percent a year, on aver-
age. But they lose money almost one in every three years. Stocks are your 
best investment for the long run . . . almost sure to beat bonds, and almost 
sure to keep you ahead of inflation, which has run at an average of about 3 
percent a year.
 
If you have a timeframe of, say, 15 years, stocks are sure to be your best bet, 
at least if history is our guide. (No guarantees.) Generally speaking, however, 
because of their volatility, you don’t want to invest in stocks any money you 
may need in the next two to three years.
Also, because the future may not be as kind as the past, don’t put all of your 
money in stocks. More aggressive portfolios may warrant as much as 85 per-
cent stocks — a variety of stock index funds, preferably. A more conservative 
portfolio may contain only 40 percent stocks.
Bonds: Your stabilizer in a storm
Over the past 80 years, bonds have gained between 5 and 6 percent a year, 
on average. But there have been a good number of years in which bonds have 
failed to keep up with inflation.
 
High-quality bonds are probably your best hedge against a serious bear 
market, so make sure you have enough money in bonds to keep you covered 
for any funds you may need in the next couple of years. If you are living off 
your portfolio, I’d like you to have at least five (and preferably ten) years’ 
living expenses in intermediate- and long-term high-quality bonds.
Conservative portfolios may include as much as 60 percent bonds. I generally 
wouldn’t recommend more than that, except perhaps for some people in high 
tax brackets who don’t need much return, and for whom tax-free municipal 
bonds may make up almost an entire portfolio. Just about everyone should 
have at the very least 15 percent of his or her portfolio in bonds.
Cash: Your lick of liquidity
Although bonds aren’t as jumpy as stocks, sometimes (especially when inter-
est rates are rising) bond prices can sink, and you don’t want to have to 
cash them out at that point. As a general rule, try to keep six months’ living 
expenses in cash. That means money-market accounts, short-term CDs, very 
short-term bond funds, or online savings accounts.

189
 Chapter 11: Developing Your Broad Investment Goals
Real estate: Net worth you can live in and possibly live on
I suggest that you not tally up the value of your home as part of your nest 
egg. After all, you will always need a place to live, so cashing out completely 
isn’t in your stars. The exception is if you plan to downsize, in which case 
part of the net worth you have tied up in your home will be available for 
other expenses. In that case, your home equity can be counted as part of 
your portfolio. Ditto for a rental property or other real estate that you can 
opt to turn into cash.
 
Real estate tends to be a nice diversifier to stocks and bonds. If you don’t want 
the hassles of direct ownership, consider a position in real estate investment 
trusts (REITs), which I discuss in Chapter 9.
Commodities: As good as gold
Gold, silver, oil, and such provide the promise of return independent of the 
ups and downs of stocks and bonds. Unfortunately, their long-term return is 
very uncertain. Commodities are not, in themselves, productive assets. Gold, 
for example, has shot up in the past few years, but prior to that, for decades 
and decades, its price rose at just about the level of inflation.
 
Commodities are an optional investment. For added diversification, you may 
want about 5 percent of your portfolio — no more — devoted to a diversified 
commodity index fund, such as I discuss in Chapter 9.
Annuities: Steady streams of income
Especially for healthy older folks with no dependents and no fears of dying 
broke, a fixed-income annuity can make a lot of sense. Here’s how it works: 
You fork part of your portfolio over to an insurance company, surrendering 
the capital and your right to it, in exchange for a steady stream of income. 
That stream of income would likely be much greater than anything you could 
pull from a diversified index portfolio.
 
If you fit the bill, I suggest a good, hard look at annuities after you reach the 
age of 70 or so. I’m talking about an immediate fixed annuity, and I suggest you 
start your shopping by looking at the offerings at Vanguard and Fidelity, which 
work with top-rated insurance companies.
 
Other annuity products (such as variable annuities, which offer a stream of 
income that varies based on the return of a hypothetical portfolio) may make 
sense for some other folks, under certain other conditions. But be careful out 
there! No area of the investment world is rifer with fraud, deceit, and con-
sumer manipulation!

190
Part III: Drawing a Blueprint for Your Index Portfolio 
Alternative investments: Nothing is too wild
Hedge funds and hedge fund–like mutual funds can be expensive and unpre-
dictable. They can also, if chosen carefully, offer good diversification and a 
reasonable expectation of favorable returns. Ditto for collectibles and expen-
sive art . . . if you have the education. You need to be very picky about which 
alternative investments you choose. I discuss a few in Chapter 9 and offer 
some examples of how they may work into your portfolio in Chapter 15. In 
only very rare circumstances would I suggest that alternative investments 
make up more than 10 percent of your portfolio.
Zeroing in on your optimal percentages
I’m going to disregard the more exotic investments for the moment and focus 
on where the lion’s share of your wealth should be invested: diversified stock 
index funds and diversified bond index funds. Using 60/40 (stocks/bonds) as 
our default, which way might you want to tweak your portfolio to best suit 
your personal financial needs? Following are a few guidelines. I also invite 
you to visit Chapter 15, where I provide sample portfolios. Perhaps you’ll see 
yourself in one of my case studies, and you can model your own portfolio 
accordingly.
 
✓ Get a handle on your time frame. Simply put, the more time you have, 
the greater the chances that your stock investments will outshine your 
bond investments. When you invest in stocks, you stand to lose a good 
chunk of your capital tomorrow. That’s not so serious if you have the 
time to allow the market to (we hope) recoup. It’s also not so serious 
if you are making regular, sizeable deposits that allow your balance to 
float upwards. But losing a good chunk can be very serious if you are 
recently retired, with no more money going into your account, and sell-
ing your depressed stock index funds becomes a necessity.
 
 If you are fairly certain that you aren’t going to need to tap your funds in 
the next 15 years, consider putting perhaps 85 percent into diversified 
stock index funds. If your investment time frame is 10 years, perhaps 80 
percent . . . 5 years, maybe aim for 75 percent.
 
✓ Know your own tolerance level for risk. It’s easy to say, “Oh, sure, I’m 
tough. I can handle ups and downs in my portfolio.” It’s another thing to 
actually do it.
 
 One of the most common, and more painful, mistakes that even a smart 
index investor can make is to pull out of the stock market just as the 
market falls. (For a full list of such morbid mistakes, see Chapter 19.) 
An aggressive portfolio of, say, 85 percent stocks, no matter how well 
indexed and diversified, is going to take a few tumbles in your lifetime. 
Using history as our gauge, you’ll probably lose money in one out of 
every three years.

191
 Chapter 11: Developing Your Broad Investment Goals
 
 I would say the odds are very small that you would lose more than 25 
percent in one year — that has happened only once in most readers’ life-
times, in 1973–74. However, it’s certainly possible. Be realistic with your-
self. Could you handle that loss without panic? (A personal note: If you 
Google “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy — Don’t Panic,” and hit Search 
Images, you’ll see the wallpaper image I use on my office computer.)
 
✓ Assess your personal financial situation carefully. You may think you 
aren’t going to need any cash infusions in the next two or three years, 
but how secure is your income, really? If you needed money in a hurry, 
do you have any family members who could help you out? How strong 
are your home, auto, and health insurance policies? Very importantly, 
what are your sources of income? A 70-year-old retiree who is comfort-
ably living off Social Security and a pension can take much more risk 
with her portfolio than a person of similar age who is directly dependent 
on her portfolio income to pay the bills.
 
✓ Take no more risk than is necessary. In the following section, I help you 
to determine how much you’re going to need to be financially indepen-
dent. The more you need, generally speaking, the more reason you have 
to push for higher portfolio returns by upping the percentage of your pie 
that you have in stocks. Anything beyond financial independence, and 
you’re looking at pure gravy. Is it worth losing sleep at night so you can 
have that gravy?
 
 I generally recommend that as you get within arm’s length of your 
reasonable financial goals, you start to temper the risk. There comes 
a point in our lives where protecting against loss becomes more impor-
tant than securing gains.
Determining How Much You 
Need to Have . . . and Save
I can imagine all sorts of financial goals. You may, for example, want to leave 
tens of millions of dollars to your already spoiled kids. You may want to save 
enough to start your own foundation, à la Bill and Melinda Gates, and start 
issuing grants to worthy causes. You may be aiming to fork over a pile of 
cash to your alma mater in exchange for their naming the new sports center 
in your honor. But such goals are rare.
For the rest of us simple folk, our financial goals tend to be similar: We want 
to get out of debt and then build up a reserve large enough so that we have 
enough money to meet our anticipated spending needs at some point in 
the future. Those needs may include a college education for the kids, a new 
home, or a few weeks at the beach next summer. Ultimately, people without 

192

fixed pensions (that is, the vast majority of under-65 Americans who aren’t 
public school teachers or members of Congress) will need a nest egg to live 
off if they’re ever going to stop gassing up the car and showing up at work 
every morning.
But how much do you need in dollar terms? And what will it take to get 
there? In this section, I give you a rough idea and refer to resources that can 
offer a more specific picture.
Employing the 20x rule
 
To get you in the ballpark of what you’re going to need in your portfolio to call 
yourself financially independent, start with the amount of money you need 
to live on comfortably for a year. Throw in all of your expenses, including not 
only the biggies — food, shelter, and medical care — but also transportation, 
clothing, movie money, and taxes. What’s your figure?
Let’s suppose it’s $60,000. Now subtract from that amount whatever you 
expect to get in income from sources other than your nest egg. Let’s sup-
pose you plan to collect $20,000 a year from Social Security. You are left with 
$40,000 a year that you’ll need from your savings.
Okay, take that $40,000 and multiply it by 20. That gives you $800,000. That 
is roughly the size of the portfolio you’re going to need to stop working at 
normal retirement age (mid-60s) and live comfortably for the rest of your life. 
(We can shave that 20 number down if you’re willing to be flexible in your 
spending; see the last section of this chapter.)
If you plan to give up the paycheck at a younger age, you should multiply 
your yearly expenditure need by 25. (Again, this can possibly be shaved 
down a bit; see the last section of this chapter.)
 
How much will you need to save to achieve that goal? For many of us, the 
answer is, very roughly, about 10 to 12 percent of our paychecks throughout 
our working years. That amount, invested wisely, should give us the nest egg 
we’ll need to be financially independent. But the amount you should be saving 
will vary greatly depending on how much you have right now, how well you 
invest, luck, inheritances, and other factors. To get more specific, both on 
the ultimate number and how much you have to save, I would refer you to a 
number of fairly good online retirement calculators, which I discuss next.
Using retirement calculators
The goal here is to plug your personal numbers into a good retirement calcu-
lator. Many retirement calculators will do you more harm than good!

193
 Chapter 11: Developing Your Broad Investment Goals
You’ve undoubtedly seen the kinds of retirement calculators I’m talking 
about, because they are all over the Internet. You input your current age, 
your retirement age, your presumed lifespan, the amount of money you 
think you’ll need a year, and — presto! — out pops a number, telling you 
the lump sum you need to save in order to retire without resorting to eating 
cardboard. You may get another number, as well, telling you how much you 
should be saving right now in order to get your requisite lump sum.
 
Um . . . I hate to tell you this, but the amounts being recommended by most 
online calculators are probably too small. Most of these calculators figure that 
you’ll be getting returns year in and year out that approximate the histori-
cal average returns of the markets (10 percent for stocks, 5 to 6 percent for 
bonds) and that the average inflation rate will continue to be 3 percent. In the 
real world, even if these averages end up being correct, you’re bound to expe-
rience huge fluctuations along the way. The only way to account for such fluc-
tuations is to use a retirement calculator that employs something called Monte 
Carlo simulations.
Understanding Monte Carlo simulations
If you were to stop collecting a paycheck tomorrow, and if you were to start 
drawing money from your nest egg, a few lousy market years at the start of the 
game could just about kill the entire plan. On the other hand, if you experience 
a few up market years at the start of the game, you’ll wonder why you didn’t 
retire years ago. Monte Carlo simulations look at all possible permutations of 
the stock and bond markets, and they show you the range of possibilities.
Figure 11-1 shows a typical Monte Carlo retirement analysis model. Note that 
some retirement calculators that use Monte Carlo actually show this analysis, 
while others use it behind the scenes and then just spit out the numbers you 
need to know.

Part III: Drawing a Blueprint for Your Index Portfolio 
This analysis reveals that a portfolio of $800,000, from which you are taking 
$40,000 a year, has a fairly good chance of lasting 30 years.
 
Calculators that use Monte Carlo analysis aren’t perfect, but they are a whole 
lot better than calculators that use just straight-line analysis.
Here are three online calculators that I recommend:
 
✓ www.firecalc.com: FIRE is short for Financial Independence/Retire 
Early, and this free Web site (feel free to contribute!) is one of the best 
you’ll find. There’s lots more here than a calculator, including some 
pretty good general investment advice, and even a forum where you can 
chat with others about retiring young, if that’s your thing.
 
✓ www.moneychimp.com/articles/volatility/retirement.htm: 
Moneychimp is a funny name, but it’s a great Web site full of all kinds 
of financial calculators. For some funny reason, there’s a ridiculously 
simple and simple-minded retirement calculator featured on the home 
page. The better calculator is buried deeper within. Make sure you use 
the long link provided here.
 
✓ www3.troweprice.com/ric/RIC/: Many of the financial supermarkets 
offer silly retirement calculators, but T. Rowe Price’s uses Monte Carlo 
simulations and is presented in an easy-to-read fashion. RIC stands for 
Retirement Income Calculator.
Knowing the limitations of even 
the best retirement calculators
 
The problem with the straight-line retirement calculators that don’t use Monte 
Carlo analysis is that they tend to greatly underestimate what you’ll need to 
be financially independent. But, alas, the Monte Carlo calculators tend to 
overestimate.
For example, suppose I have $500,000 in my portfolio and I’m a year off from 
retirement. If I assume an average 7 percent growth rate in my portfolio, and 
I plan on living off my money for 30 years, I can withdraw $40,300 a year and 
my money will last, according to the simple straight-line calculator on the 
homepage of www.moneychimp.com.
But if I run the same numbers though the Monte Carlo retirement calculator 
that appears elsewhere on the same Web site, I’m told that, given the volatil-
ity of markets, my $500,000 portfolio has only a 46 percent chance of lasting 
30 years if I withdraw $40,300 a year. To have a 96 percent chance of my 
money lasting as long as I do, I’d have to have $800,000 in the bank, according 
to this calculator!

195
 Chapter 11: Developing Your Broad Investment Goals
So which is it? If I need $40,300 a year, am I shooting for a $500,000 nest egg 
or $800,000? The answer: Something in between. Yes, you need to account 
for the volatility that exists in the real world, and that is reflected in the 
Monte Carlo analysis. On the other hand, Monte Carlo analysis is looking at 
worst-case scenarios, and do you really want to scrimp your entire life on the 
chance that you’ll encounter a worst-case scenario?
 
If I wanted to enjoy a 30-year retirement, and I needed $40,300 a year (inflation-
adjusted) from my portfolio to have that retirement, I’d feel great if I had 
$800,000 in the bank. If I didn’t have that kind of money, but I dreaded going 
into the office every day, I’d make a deal with myself: To retire and withdraw 
$40,300 a year (adjusted upward slightly each year for inflation), but to be will-
ing to tighten my belt and reduce that spending amount considerably if the 
market didn’t do well, especially in the early years of my retirement.
My asset mix would likely be somewhere in the 60/40 (60 percent stocks/40 
percent bonds) range. The vast majority of that money would be in low-cost 
index funds, of course. And I’d have diversification not only between stocks 
and bonds, but within the stock and bond sides of my portfolio, as well. What 
kind of diversification? Glad you asked! That’s the subject of the very next 
chapter.

▶ Understanding the difference between value and growth
▶ Differentiating among your bond index holdings
I
f you’ve read Chapter 11, you should have step one of your index portfo-
lio blueprint complete. (If you haven’t done so, I encourage you to back 
up one chapter!) You know where your risk–return sweet spot is generally 
located, and you have determined your proper mix of stocks and bonds.
Now comes step two.
There are thousands of stock indexes, and nearly as many bond indexes. They 
come in every size, nationality, industry sector, maturity, and quality. Which 
ones do you choose (and in which proportions?), and which ones do you 
ignore?
Whereas the split between stocks and bonds is fairly easy to grasp, this 
second stage of portfolio diversification usually leaves hapless investors 
tearing out their hair by the roots. Those who decide to become index inves-
tors must still decide which indexes to follow. INDEX INVESTING DOES NOT 
MEAN PLUNKING ALL OF YOUR MONEY INTO THE S&P 500! (Sorry to shout, 
but some obnoxious proponents of active investing sometimes throw this 
assumption out as a straw-man argument against indexing, and it ticks me 
off!) Proper index investing calls for a diversity of index funds.
But do you want primarily U.S. stocks or foreign stocks? Value companies 
or growth companies? Large caps or small caps? Index funds exist for all of 
them. On the bond side, do you want Treasuries or corporate bonds? Long-
term bonds or short-term bonds? Investment-grade bonds or high-yield 
bonds? Index funds exist for all of those, too.

198
Part III: Drawing a Blueprint for Your Index Portfolio 
 
The answer, in a nut: You want them all, provided that your portfolio is large 
enough and that you don’t wind up slicing and dicing yourself into too compli-
cated a portfolio to properly manage.
Achieving excellent diversification through index funds isn’t really that hard. 
All you need is a bit of background information, which I give you on the fol-
lowing pages. Please note that I mention plenty of individual index funds in 
Part II (stock funds in Chapter 7, bond funds in Chapter 8, others in Chapter 
9). In Chapter 15, I present model portfolios with specific funds. This chapter 
isn’t so specific . . . It’s more about the kinds of indexes you want your funds 
to mirror. To put it another way, this chapter is about asset allocation — 
what kinds of assets do you want to invest in?
Expanding Your Geographic Horizons
 
The world is a big place, and yet U.S. investors seem to have only recently 
discovered that. Thanks to the high returns in international stocks over the 
past decade, Mr. and Mrs. Smith have finally been diversifying. Still, the world 
stock market is now about 60 percent non-U.S. (see Figure 12-1), and few U.S. 
investors have anywhere near that percentage of foreign stock in their portfo-
lios. That’s okay . . . 60 percent isn’t necessary. I would, however, like to see 
you with at least 40 percent international holdings on the equity side of your 
portfolio.
Of that minimum 40 percent in non-U.S. stocks, you want a division between 
developed (rich) markets and emerging (not-so-rich) markets, because the 
two kinds of markets tend to move in different cycles. (Emerging market 
economies tend to be tied very much to the prices of the commodities they 
produce.)
 
There’s no magic formula for deciding what percent of your stock portfolio 
should be invested in General Electric, Microsoft, and Wal-Mart versus Nestle, 
British Petroleum, and Toyota Motor Corporation. But for maximum diversifi-
cation, you want to spread your bets out as much as possible. The most highly 
diversified (and therefore, in some ways, safest) portfolio would give you a 
share of every stock on the planet, in every country.
In the real world, however, foreign stocks, even big ones in stable coun-
tries, bring somewhat more volatility. That’s because of currency swings. 
Emerging-market stocks, as you would expect, are considerably more volatile 
in their own right, given that poor countries are more susceptible to eco-
nomic upheavals, government coups, and such. In addition, the index funds 
that invest in foreign stocks, especially emerging-market stocks, tend to carry 
heavier expenses.

For those reasons, and not for any jingoistic inclinations, I assure you, I feel 
that an optimal portfolio is justified in overweighting the United States a bit. 
That’s why I don’t insist that you invest 60 percent of your stock portfolio 
abroad — 40 percent is just fine. A range of 35 to 50 would work.
Considering correlation
You hear lots of people these days talk about how it’s a small world. They 
speak of globalization and the greater correlation among national stock mar-
kets caused by that globalization.

200
Part III: Drawing a Blueprint for Your Index Portfolio 
Yes, oui, si, ja. There is truth to that indeed.
In 1998, about 30 percent of all the revenues of U.S. corporations were derived 
from business activities outside of the United States — the sale of McDonald’s 
hamburgers in France and John Deere tractors in Argentina. That figure is 
now higher than 40 percent. So even if you hold nothing but U.S. stocks, your 
portfolio returns will be closely linked to foreign economies. And the reverse is 
very much (even more) true, as well: Most foreign stocks and all foreign stock 
markets are at least somewhat linked to the humongous U.S. economy.
But that doesn’t eliminate the need for global diversification in your stock 
portfolio.
 
While stocks in different countries have become largely correlated in the same 
direction, there is still plenty of diversification, at least in the degree of change.
Even the stock markets of Canada and Mexico — two countries whose econo-
mies and stock markets are very, very closely tied to the U.S. economy — still 
offer good diversification power. In the first seven months of 2008, for exam-
ple, the Dow was down 16 percent, while the Canadian market had dropped 
only 1.6 percent and the Mexican market barely 5 percent.
 
Also, keep in mind that while large company stock indexes tend to move more 
in synch, small company stock indexes still very much go up and down some-
what independently. Small companies generally cater to local markets much 
more than they export. That’s why I suggest that a full half of your foreign 
stock investments be linked to foreign small company indexes. (I discuss this 
topic more in a few pages.)
Just a few years ago, foreign small company indexes were hard to invest in. 
That has changed. Several foreign small company ETFs now allow you to 
index this important part of your portfolio.
Going regional, not national
I do feel a need to issue one strong suggestion where it comes to interna-
tional investing: Go regional, please. Think Europe, Asia, and emerging mar-
kets as your asset classes — not Belgium, Singapore, and Brazil.
 
Many ETFs, in particular, track foreign single-country indexes. With the excep-
tion perhaps of the Japanese and British stock markets — the second and 
third largest in the world — I would avoid buying such ETFs. The Japanese 
and British markets are large enough to qualify as regional investments. Other 
countries’ stock markets are generally smaller than you’d think, offering lots 
in the way of volatility and little in the way of diversification. The entire market 
capitalization (all public stocks of all companies based in a country) of certain 
nations is only a fraction of the total market capitalization of certain single 
corporations! (See Figure 12-2 for examples of this point.)

Part III: Drawing a Blueprint for Your Index Portfolio 
 
You can slice and dice a portfolio only so many ways. It is impractical to own 
ETFs representing 50 individual countries, and it is overly hopeful to think 
that you are smart enough to pick the one or two countries that will do better 
than all the rest. Choose ETFs or index mutual funds that represent good-sized 
areas of the planet, not pin-points.
Choosing Large and Small, 
Value and Growth Stocks
In the often Alice-in-Wonderland world of investing, where little makes sense, 
people seemingly can’t get enough in the way of big company stocks and, in 
particular, growth stocks. But if you’re going to pick any kind of company to 
invest in, small value companies, rather than large growth companies, make 
the most sense.
Sizing up the difference between 
large and small
Ready to witness a big, fat paradox? According to Morningstar figures, the 
amount of money invested in U.S. large cap stock funds is now $2.7 trillion. 
That compares to only $315 billion invested in small cap stock funds. The 
ratio is 8.6 to 1.
Yikes!
Consider now, again from Morningstar, the standard deviation (a classic 
measure of volatility), total return, and Sharpe Ratio (which measures return 
per unit of risk) for large cap stocks versus small cap stocks over the past 15 
years. Table 12-1 shows all the details.

203
 Chapter 12: Fine-Tuning Your Index Selections
If we go back even farther in time, the difference in long-term return on small 
company versus large company stocks becomes even starker. The average 
annual return for all U.S. large company stocks from 1925 to the present is 
estimated to be 10.4 percent. For all U.S. small company stocks, the average 
annual growth rate has been 12.5 percent. That’s a difference in return of 20 
percent a year between the two.
 
General moral of story: Small cap stocks are a bit more volatile than large cap 
stocks, but they provide greater long-term return. On balance, per unit of risk, 
small cap stocks are the winners.
 
Specific moral of story: As much (or almost as much) as you invest in large 
cap, you should also invest in small cap stocks, both on the U.S. side of the 
portfolio and the international. This is not only because of the numbers in 
Table 12-1; it’s also because there’s less correlation between U.S. and interna-
tional small cap stocks than between U.S. and international large caps.
Will a portfolio of 50 percent (or almost 50 percent) small cap stocks be more 
volatile than an S&P 500 portfolio? A bit, yes. If you feel uncomfortable with 
that risk, tone it down by adding to your bond and cash positions.
Tallying up the difference between 
value and growth
A much stronger paradox — an almost unbelievable paradox — exists where 
it comes to comparing growth company stocks to value stocks. People just 
love growth stocks. But value stocks truly kick butt.
As I discuss in Chapter 7, value stocks are bargain-basement stocks, usually 
in “turtle” industries like utilities, natural resources, and banking. Growth 
stocks are often popular and may be expensive, but they belong to hot, 
fast-growing companies usually in “hare” industries, like microtechnology, 
genetic medicine, and solar energy panels.
According to Morningstar figures, the amount of money invested in U.S. 
growth stock funds is now $1.26 trillion. That compares to only $880 billion 
invested in value stock funds. Double yikes!
According to figures from Ibbotson Associates, a Morningstar company, con-
sider the difference between the historical return of value stocks and growth 
stocks. As Table 12-2 shows, the difference in return per unit of risk is rather 
dramatic. These figures are for the period 1969 through 2007.

How can it be that value stocks have such a superior long-term track record —
higher returns with lesser volatility? No one knows for sure, but it’s probably
due to people’s perpetual confusion that good companies make for good 
stocks.
 
Growth companies, undoubtedly the best companies to work for, do not 
always make for the best investments. Everyone expects them to grow, 
and the lofty price of their stocks (often a great multiple of actual earnings) 
reflects that. If the company grows as everyone expects, the stock may do 
well. If the company doesn’t do as well as everyone expects — even if it does 
well! — ker-pow!, the stock gets hammered.
Value companies, on the other hand, aren’t expected to take off, and there-
fore their stocks sell cheap. If the company does better than expected — 
even if it doesn’t make money! — the stock may take off. Value companies 
also pay much higher dividends than do growth companies, which typically 
funnel most of their profits back into R&D, advertising, and fuel for the CEO’s 
yacht.
 
Moral of story: In the large cap arena, given the long-term track record of value 
versus growth, I would lean toward value. You don’t want to put everything in 
value, should we have another decade like the 1990s, when growth ruled. But I 
would suggest that if you have, say, 20 percent of your stock portfolio devoted 
to large cap U.S. stocks, and you divide that into value and growth, you might 
have 11 percent in a large cap value index fund and 9 percent in a large cap 
growth fund.
 
On the small cap side, the value “premium” is much stronger . . . or at least, 
it has been. There are no guarantees that the value premium will continue. 
But I do doubt that it will disappear entirely, and it is hard for me to imagine a 
growth premium lasting for too long. If you have, say, 20 percent of your port-
folio allocated to U.S. small cap stocks, and you are splitting that up between a 
small cap value and a small cap growth fund, I might devote 12 percent to the 
value fund and 8 percent to the growth fund.
Yes, the value premium is just as strong in other countries as it is in the United 
States. Your international holdings also deserve a good solid value lean.

Putting the Stock Side of 
Your Portfolio Together
When you factor in the divisions between U.S./foreign, large/small, and value/
growth, you get a portfolio that looks something like the one I present in 
Table 12-3. This is a very general guideline to what an optimal portfolio (at 
least the stock side of the portfolio) may look like for an average investor.

Factoring in your personal connection 
to the markets
I need to talk to you very personally for a moment. You are, after all, an 
individual. Unique . . . even if you’re a twin. Your optimal portfolio is not 
your brother’s or your best friend’s. I want you to think about several things 
before choosing your optimal asset allocation. That optimal asset allocation 
may look a lot like the one I present in Table 12-3 — or it may not.

206
Part III: Drawing a Blueprint for Your Index Portfolio 
Do you, for starters, own real estate other than your primary home? If so, 
and if the value of your combined properties equals a good percentage (more 
than 40 percent or so) of your net worth, you may want to lighten up on your 
U.S. REIT exposure, applying more of your portfolio money to either non-U.S. 
REITs or the rest of your stock portfolio. Housing prices, including the price 
of your home and the performance of REITs, go somewhat hand-in-hand.
Adding up your options
Next personal question: Do you own company stock? If your 401(k) is filled 
with company stock, or if you are given stock options as a bonus of the job, 
you may want to factor that into your portfolio mix.
If, for example, you work for a large, foreign value company, and the value 
of your stock options with that company is equal to half your net worth, you 
certainly would want to lighten up on the large foreign allocation that I sug-
gest for the average portfolio, or at the very least lean that allocation heavily 
toward growth stocks.
See how it works?
Fixing Your Fixed-Income 
Side of the Portfolio
Just as on the stock side of your portfolio, it makes perfect sense to diver-
sify the fixed-income side of your portfolio by choosing various index funds 
Recognizing industry sector funds
Some people choose to divide their stock port-
folios up entirely by industry sector: energy, 
consumer staples, consumer discretionary, 
utilities, natural resources, and so on. There are 
many ETFs, as well as index mutual funds, that 
allow for this kind of portfolio diversification.
There’s nothing wrong with this approach, but 
I find it more cumbersome than dividing up a 
portfolio by style (large/small/value/growth). 
It also tends to be more expensive. The style 
funds, for whatever reason, tend to be cheaper 
than the sector funds.
The main beef I have against the industry-
sector approach is that it doesn’t allow you to 
take advantage of the value or small cap pre-
miums I discuss in this chapter. And those are 
premiums well worth taking advantage of!

207
 Chapter 12: Fine-Tuning Your Index Selections
that mirror different indexes. It may not be as crucial, because bond indexes 
aren’t as volatile as stock indexes, but diversification is still important.
Stocks tend to be broken up by geography, cap size, and style, and sometimes 
by industry sector. Bonds, on the other hand, tend to be broken up most often 
by maturity and credit quality, both of which I discuss in Chapter 8.
Reframing the reason for bonds
The purpose of bonds is to provide ballast to a portfolio. The high returns 
(we hope the high returns!) in your portfolio will come from stocks. So the 
first question I ask myself in constructing the bond side of a portfolio is, natu-
rally enough, how to get the most ballast.
You obviously want your bonds to zig if the stock market should zag. For 
that reason, I’m not a big fan of high-yield (junk) bonds, which tend to sink in 
value, just like stocks do, in hard economic times. Rather, I prefer top-quality 
bonds issued by institutions that are unlikely to go belly-up. I’m also wary 
of holding too much in very long-term bonds, which offer less price stabil-
ity than shorter-term bonds. Long-term bonds, although they tend to be less 
volatile than stocks, can be volatile all the same.
Do you need international bonds?
Having a global bond portfolio adds diversi-
fication but also, because you are most likely 
adding in foreign currency, adds possible vola-
tility. I don’t mind volatility on the equity side of 
a portfolio, but I don’t like it in fixed income. For 
that reason, if you buy my advice and already 
have roughly half your stock allocation abroad, 
I’d say you can pass on international bonds.
If you really want them, there are currently a 
handful of indexing options, including the SPDR 
Lehman International Treasury Bond ETF (BWX) 
and the SPDR DB International Government 
Inflation-Protected Bond ETF (WIP). Both offer 
high-quality international bond exposure; both 
charge 0.50 a year in operating expenses.
You can also find two international high-yield 
options: the PowerShares Emerging Markets 
Sovereign Debt Portfolio ETF (PCY) and the 
iShares JPMorgan USD Emerging Markets 
Bond Fund (EMB). Although I’m not a big fan 
of junk bonds or international bonds, when 
you combine them, they actually make for an 
okay investment. I would suggest considering 
one of these funds if your portfolio is more than 
$100,000 or so. I have a slight preference for 
the PCY, which has a lower expense ratio than 
EMB: 0.50 percent versus 0.60 percent.
International junk bonds promise high returns 
without the correlation to the U.S. stock market 
that you’ll find with U.S. junk. I would not, how-
ever, include this as part of the fixed-income side 
of your portfolio. Even though it is technically 
fixed income, you’ll be seeing possible stock-
like returns and stock-like volatility; include this 
fund as part (a small part — less than 10 per-
cent) of the equity side of your portfolio.

Part III: Drawing a Blueprint for Your Index Portfolio 
Zeroing in on safety first, returns second
U.S. Treasuries, backed by the full credit of the federal government, repre-
sent the gold standard of high-quality bonds — just what you want if the 
stock market starts to tank. Investment-grade corporate bonds, issued by 
solid companies, also tend to hold their own in bad economic times, and 
they provide a little added juice, generally a percentage point higher than 
Treasuries.
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are issued by the federal gov-
ernment. They pay you a very modest rate of interest, but the principal is 
adjusted upwards twice a year to meet inflation. TIPS tend to move in some-
what different cycles from traditional bonds.
For most folks, I recommend a bond allocation that looks something like what 
I present in Table 12-4. There are plenty of index funds to represent each of 
the bond asset classes.

Mixing and Matching Passive 
and Active Investing
In This Chapter
▶ Examining index-like active mutual funds
▶ Ferreting out the best fund companies
▶ Seeking out irrational despondency
▶ Tilting your portfolio to (maybe, just maybe) beat the market
T
his is the chapter, dear reader, where I, your friendly well-meaning 
author, risk getting tarred and feathered, and possibly hanged, drawn, 
and quartered, by the most diehard proponents of index investing. If you are 
such a diehard proponent, please give me a chance to explain why I think all 
active investing isn’t all bad all the time! I have my reasons. Good reasons. I 
promise!
Before you read this chapter, please know that nothing I say within contra-
dicts what I say in this book’s other chapters. Index investing is far and away 
a superior kind of investing, and if you do nothing but index invest (provided 
you do it with intelligence), you’re going to beat the pants off the vast major-
ity of investors. There is no need to delve into active investing. This chapter 
is optional. You can do just fine without it. Honest.
If, however, you’re willing to do a bit of extra legwork and take on perhaps a 
smidgeon of added risk, I believe that mixing and matching index investing 
with active investing may make for a truly optimal portfolio. It’s the portfolio 
I built for myself years ago (yes, that portfolio has done very well, thank you) 
and the portfolio I recommend to my clients (they’ve done very well, too). 
The portfolio is mostly an index portfolio . . . with a few carefully chosen 
exceptions, which are all made for solid reasons.
On the pages that follow, I describe those exceptions. They come in two 
large, general categories, which I call Buy-and-Hold Index Investing Exception 
Type A and Buy-and-Hold Index Investing Exception Type B. Here is how I 
define them:

210
Part III: Drawing a Blueprint for Your Index Portfolio 
 
✓ Buy-and-Hold Index Investing Exception Type A: Incorporating some funds — 
mutual funds or ETFs — into your portfolio that use active management, 
but only certain funds from certain well-trusted companies that pay deep 
respect to the important lessons of indexing, such as low costs, tax effi-
ciency, and strategic clarity. Even then, I look for one more thing in an 
actively managed fund: a tendency to zig when my stock index funds zag.
 
✓ Buy-and-Hold Index Investing Exception Type B: Tweaking — preferably 
mildly! — your index fund holdings to overweight sectors of the market 
that are perhaps undervalued and poised for a return from oblivion. In 
essence, this is the exact opposite of what most investors do, which is 
to chase hot sectors. You (oh-so-cautiously) chase cold sectors! If you 
want a fancy word for this strategy, some investor types call it tactical 
asset allocation.
I’ll now explore each of these exceptions in turn. Hold the tar and feathers at 
least until the end of the chapter!
Using Active Strategies That Borrow 
from the Wisdom of Indexing
As you know if you’ve read the first few chapters of this book, the reasons 
that index investing works, and works so well, are numerous. But tops on 
anyone’s list is the low cost of indexing. You can easily build an entire indexed 
portfolio that’ll run you about 0.30 percent or less in operating fees a year — a 
full percentage point less than what most actively managed portfolios would 
cost you. That difference, over the course of time, gives indexers an almost 
unbeatable advantage.
Following right behind the difference in operating fees, we find differences 
in miscellaneous expenses (namely, the costs involved with the frequent 
trading of stocks that often occurs in actively managed portfolios) and big 
differences in tax efficiency. Actively managed portfolios, by virtue of their 
constant turnover, often send you very depressing tax bills.
But what if you could find an actively managed fund, or two, or three, that 
offer you low costs and tax efficiency? Or what if you were to build your port-
folio in a tax-advantaged account, such as an IRA, where the tax efficiency of 
individual funds isn’t really an issue? Might an actively managed approach 
make possible sense in such circumstances?
Yes, it might. Might. You will still likely lose if you start picking actively man-
aged funds willy-nilly. But if you follow a few rules, you may just do okay for 
yourself.

211
 Chapter 13: Mixing and Matching Passive and Active Investing
Seven rules for investing in 
actively managed funds
If you want to add an actively managed component to a primarily indexed 
portfolio, I would ask you to start your shopping by going through the rules 
below, step by step.
Rule 1: Look for index-like qualities in any fund you pick
The link between long-term fund performance and operating expenses 
(sometimes called the net expense ratio or management fees) is as tight as 
the link between green grass and rain. Low-cost funds are best. Don’t even 
consider any funds with loads (up-front commissions); choose only no-load 
funds. From the universe of no-load funds, look most strongly at funds that 
charge less than other funds in their category. For domestic stock and bond 
funds, for example, you shouldn’t need to go over 1 percentage point a year 
in expenses. For international funds, perhaps 1.5 percent should be the maxi-
mum you’re willing to spend.
Rule 2: Avoid closet index funds
If you’re going to choose an actively managed fund to slip into your predomi-
nantly indexed portfolio, make sure that you are actually getting an actively 
managed fund. Some “active” fund managers, knowing full well the power of 
indexing, sneakily hug the indexes but charge you much higher fees than you 
would have to pay for an index fund. These are called closet index funds.
 
How do you identify one? If you have access to certain fund analysis pro-
grams (such as Morningstar Premium), you can check the fund’s coefficient 
of determination, otherwise referred to as R-squared or R2. Any fund with an 
R-squared of more than 85 or so may qualify as an index fund. An R-squared 
of, say, 85 in a large cap U.S. blend fund would mean that 85 percent of the 
fund’s holdings are the same as the holdings of the S&P 500 index. If that’s the 
case, why not just hold the index?!
The other, perhaps easier, thing you can do is go to http://finance.
yahoo.com, look up the fund in question, find the chart for one-, three-, and 
five-year performance, and compare the ups and downs to those of the index. 
If they move in unison, you may as well just hold the index.
Rule 3: Show a bias for small cap
This isn’t a biggie, but if you are going to go active anywhere on the style 
chart (large growth/large value/small growth/small value), you probably up 
your chances of beating the market in the small cap arena. I suppose it is 
logical that an active manager who focuses on small cap stocks has a better 
chance of discovering a hidden gem than some manager focusing on large 

212
Part III: Drawing a Blueprint for Your Index Portfolio 
cap companies, which tend to be much more in the public (and analyst) eye. 
What seems true and what is true are often not always the same, but in this 
case, some research shows that small cap actively run funds do have a better 
chance than large cap funds of beating their respective indexes. Keep in 
mind, however, that in both categories — large cap and small cap — the odds 
are in the favor of index funds.
Rule 4: Search for yin and yang
This is the corollary to the point I make above about avoiding a closet index 
fund. You want something different than the indexes you already own . . . 
something that will add to the diversification of your entire portfolio . . . 
something that may do well when everything else in tanking. One of the very 
first things I look at in choosing an actively managed fund is that fund’s perfor-
mance record during the bear market of 2000–2002. And look again at how the 
fund did in the more dismal days of 2008. Any fund that held its own during 
these terrible times for the stock market just may hold its own the next time 
the market starts to bleed.
Rule 5: Pick a fund company that you can trust
Too many actively managed funds have been involved in scandals of one sort 
or another, with investors losing money in the process. (As I’m writing this 
chapter, the business pages are full of news about Bear Stearns executives 
allegedly stealing money from investors in certain of its hedge funds.) That 
sort of thing never happens with index funds, and likely never will.
Do a Google search of any fund companies you are considering, and check 
out the ten clean fund companies I list in the next section. I list one possible 
fund to consider from each company, but in most cases, you can find other 
funds worth investigating. This is especially true for Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, 
and Dodge & Cox — these are all scandal-free companies with a diverse 
selection of actively managed funds that tend to be among the best in the 
industry. Vanguard and T. Rowe Price also serve as discount, diverse bro-
kerage houses (sometimes known as financial supermarkets) where you can 
invest in index mutual funds, ETFs, or just about whatever you like. Fidelity 
Investments, although involved in at least one minor scandal involving cer-
tain traders and certain strippers, is also an overall reputable mutual fund 
company and brokerage house.
Rule 6: Check the long-term performance history
I put performance history almost last on my list, even though it is first — and 
often the only thing! — on most people’s lists. Don’t buy a fund because it 
scored big in the past 12 months and is now featured on the cover of Wise 
Money magazine! That’s just plain dumb. The fund manager may have been 
lucky. More often than that, the fund is simply investing in a certain kind of 
investment (such as commodities or Latin American stocks) that happens to 

213
 Chapter 13: Mixing and Matching Passive and Active Investing
have done exceptionally well last year. Performance figures don’t mean squat 
unless you are looking at long-term performance figures! Check the figures for 
10 years, 15 years, or longer if possible. Performance figures are especially 
important when you are looking into funds that use highly unconventional 
investment strategies, such as merger arbitration or long–short tactics.
Rule 7: Don’t go overboard! Remember that index investing is likely to 
be superior in the long run!
Keep the majority of your money in index funds. Consider the active funds 
section of your portfolio the ancillary part of your nest egg. Limit it to no 
more than 25 percent of your portfolio. Some call this strategy a core–satellite 
approach to portfolio construction: Use index funds as the core of your 
portfolio and actively managed funds as your satellites. Alternatively, limit 
the overall average expense ratio on your entire portfolio to no more than 
0.50 percent, and you’ll force yourself to keep an index or largely index-like 
approach.
Ten actively managed funds 
that fit the bill
To get you started in the possible (strictly optional!) mixing and matching of 
active with passive investing, I’m going to share some of the actively man-
aged funds that I’ve used either in my own portfolio, the portfolios of clients, 
or both. I give you some basic information, such as the operating expenses, 
the long-term performance record, and the fund’s bear-market performance 
track record. And I share with you my rationale for considering that a par-
ticular fund be added to a primarily indexed portfolio. Please research these 
funds carefully before buying, however. You always incur somewhat more 
risk when buying an actively managed fund than when buying an index fund. 
(The manager could go on an African safari tomorrow and be trampled by an 
angry hippopotamus, for example.)
You may note that all of the funds below are mutual funds, and none are 
ETFs. Actively managed ETFs are new, and they lack the track record that 
gives me any great confidence. Some of the fundamental indexed ETFs that 
I discuss in Chapter 14 may qualify as actively or quasi-actively managed in 
some people’s books, I realize. But I’ll leave those to Chapter 14 and restrict 
the conversation here to the self-acknowledged and universally agreed-upon 
active management mutual funds.
I present these funds in alphabetical order, so you can’t assume the top one 
is my favorite. These funds are all over the map in terms of what they invest 
in. In choosing a particular fund, you want its asset class to fit into your 
entire portfolio, as I discuss in all the other chapters of Part III. (Asset class 

214
Part III: Drawing a Blueprint for Your Index Portfolio 
means a category of investment that tends to move somewhat independently 
of others. Some examples are large cap value stocks, long-term municipal 
bonds, and gold.) Your choice of asset classes will tend to have a greater 
bearing on your portfolio performance than the choice of individual funds.
CGM Focus (CGMFX)
This fund doesn’t have the longest of track records, but what it does have 
has been beyond spectacular. Could it be luck? Yes, it certainly could be. If 
you’re itching to test a bit of your portfolio with active management, a small 
percentage of your portfolio in the CGM Focus fund may just pay off — but be 
sure you’re willing to take the added risk. Caveat: The turnover on this fund 
is HUGE (around 400 percent a year). Do not put this terribly tax-inefficient 
fund into a taxable account! This fund belongs only in your IRA. And limit 
your exposure to a small percentage of your portfolio — no more than 5 per-
cent, and preferably 4. This fund can be very volatile! Note, too, that the CGM 
Focus fund, unlike the vast majority of mutual funds, is not available at most 
financial supermarkets. You must go directly to the Boston-based fund com-
pany. Filling out the application form isn’t too onerous, but keeping this fund 
will require a bit of extra paperwork year in and year out.
What the fund invests in: About 25 company stocks, roughly half of them 
U.S.-based and the other half from Canada and farther away. The companies 
are fairly large, with a bias toward growth.
The fund’s birth date: September, 1997
Minimum purchase, IRA: $1,000
Your yearly fees to the mutual fund company: 0.99 percent
10-year average annual return (5/31/08): 25.72 percent
10-year average annual return of relevant index (S&P 500): 4.1 percent 
(Note that since half of the fund’s stocks are non-U.S., this benchmark is not 
terribly relevant, but I don’t know of any that are.)
Performance during the three-year bear market (2000, 2001, 2002): 53.9 
percent, 47.6 percent, –17.8 percent

Dodge & Cox Stock (DODGX)
This Boston-based company has been around for a very long time, and they 
quite obviously get it. With an index-like approach to active investing, Dodge 
& Cox’s five mutual funds rather consistently match the markets or some-
times do a little better. The fund management is done by teams, and they 
clearly take a long-term, sensible approach to what they do, eking out enough 
alpha to earn their management fee and have a bit left over for investors. 
(Alpha is a bit of industry jargon; it means return due to active management.) 
If you are inclined to step a little bit into active management, the flagship 
Dodge & Cox Stock fund is without question one of the best choices you 
could make. The other Dodge & Cox funds aren’t bad, either.
What the fund invests in: Stocks of largish U.S. companies with a lean toward 
value.
The fund’s birth date: January, 1965
Minimum purchase, non-retirement account: $2,500
Your yearly fees to the mutual fund company: 0.52 percent
15-year average annual return (5/31/08): 13.26 percent
15-year average annual return of a relevant index (S&P 500): 9.88 percent

Fairholme Fund (FAIRX)
Fairholme is a one-fund shop, and even though this fund charges a teeny bit 
more — 0.01 percent more! — than I would normally advocate for any domes-
tic stock fund, I find it enticing enough to bend my rule. Whatever it takes 
to pick stocks, the people behind Fairholme seem to have the stuff. Still, the 
fund doesn’t have a very long track record. It is also subject to style drift, 
making crisp portfolio allocation difficult. So even though I am impressed and 
intrigued with Fairholme’s performance — especially during the bear market 
years — I wouldn’t recommend that you put more than a few percentage 
points of your portfolio into Fairholme . . . certainly no more than 5 percent. 
You are taking something of a gamble.

Fidelity Low-Priced Stock (FLPSX)
Fidelity is a humongous company, and sometimes the right arm doesn’t know 
what the left arm is doing. (As a financial journalist, several times asking for 
permission to reprint Fidelity charts, I’ve run into more bureaucratic red tape 
than existed in the former Soviet Union. In fact, I’m certain that Fidelity has 
hired former Soviet KGB agents to run its legal department.) Nonetheless, 
the company does seem to get it right where it comes to running some of 
its many, many actively managed funds. Take Fidelity Low-Priced Stock, for 
example. It’s been around for a good while and has a rather impressive track 
record.
What the fund invests in: Stocks of small and middle-sized companies, mainly 
in the United States but also abroad, all with a strong lean toward value
The fund’s birth date: December, 1989
Minimum purchase, non-retirement account: $2,500
Your yearly fees to the mutual fund company: 0.97 percent

Hussman Strategic Growth Fund (HSGFX)
This is what’s known as a long–short fund. Technically, it’s a stock fund. But 
the manager, John Hussman, picks both stocks he sees poised for growth, 
which he buys long (outright) and, at the same time, picks stocks poised for 
death, which he buys short. In the end, you get a fund that should, in theory, 
perform with very little if any correlation to the stock market. On the other 
hand, you probably aren’t going to see the long-term performance that you 
would see by investing in stock index funds. Use Hussman, if you wish, for 
a hedge against your stock holdings. Although it’s technically a stock fund, 
I would treat it more like a bond fund: Have bond fund–like expectations for 
this holding (about 5 percent growth a year), and you probably won’t be too 
disappointed. If you see it as a stock fund, you likely will be disappointed. 
Use this fund only in a retirement account — the tax ramifications could be 
nasty.
What the fund invests in: Stocks of large companies, mostly U.S.-based and 
mostly growth. But, unlike most stock funds, Hussman buys some stocks long 
and others (banking on a downfall) short.
The fund’s birth date: July, 2000
Minimum purchase, IRA: $500.
Your yearly fees to the mutual fund company: 1.17 percent
Five-year average annual return (5/31/08): 6.29 percent
Five-year average annual return of relevant index: There really is no rel-
evant index, but I would tend to compare it to the Lehman Aggregate Bond 
Index, which in the past five years has returned an annual 3.83 percent. (The 
Hussman fund would tend to be a bit more volatile.)

Longleaf Partners Fund (LLPFX)
If all actively managed funds were this good, I may not have written this book! 
Longleaf uses an index-like approach (modest costs, little turnover) to choose 
stocks the managers see poised for growth. They’ve been at it for over two 
decades, and they are doing better than the vast majority of actively managed 
funds. Like Dodge & Cox, Longleaf offers an alternative approach to wise core 
investing. This fund, and the Dodge & Cox fund, are just about the only actively 
managed funds to which I would even consider allocating more than 5 percent of 
your portfolio. The flagship Longleaf Partners Fund could, if you want it to, give 
you much of your U.S. large cap exposure. Unfortunately, because it isn’t a pure 
U.S. large cap stock fund, it will make your total portfolio construction difficult.
What the fund invests in: About 80 percent large U.S. company stocks, 20 
percent large non-U.S. company stocks
The fund’s birth date: April, 1987
Minimum purchase, non-retirement account: $10,000
Your yearly fees to the mutual fund company: 0.89 percent

Loomis Sayles Bond Fund (LSBRX/LSBDX)
Honestly, I don’t know how they do it. I also wrote Bond Investing For 
Dummies, so I do know something about bonds. And the rules of bond invest-
ing tell us that the bond markets are very efficient, so it’s extremely hard 
to beat the market. Yet Dan Fuss and his team at Loomis seem to do it with 
great consistency. The long-term returns of the Loomis Sayles Bond Fund are 
eye-popping, far superior to the relevant indexes. As I said, I’m not entirely 
sure how they do it, but they do, and they’ve done it for a very long time. I 
must question, of course, whether the next 15 years will be as kind to Loomis 
investors as the past 15 years, but I think it may be worth a small gamble. 
You may consider as much as one-third of your long-term bond holdings in 
the Loomis Sayles Bond Fund, especially if you have a fat portfolio and can 

219
 Chapter 13: Mixing and Matching Passive and Active Investing
afford to allocate $100,000. That qualifies you for the Loomis Sayles Bond 
Institutional class (LSBDX), which comes with a much smaller expense ratio 
than does the retail class of the fund (LSBRX).
What the fund invests in: Bonds, bonds, bonds of all sorts, but mostly invest-
ment grade, mostly U.S., and mostly long term
The fund’s birth date: May, 1991
Minimum purchase, non-retirement account: $2,500 for LSBRX; $100,000 
for LSBDX
Your yearly fees to the mutual fund company: 0.95 percent for LSBRX; 0.67 
percent for LSBDX
15-year average annual return (5/31/08): 9.76 for LSBRX; 10.04 percent 
for LSBDX
15-year average annual return of relevant index (Lehman Brothers 
Aggregate Bond): 6.2 percent
Performance during the three-year bear market (2000, 2001, 2002): 4.1, 2.3, 
13.2 (Note: These were not bear market years for investment-grade bonds, so 
most of the funds in the same category as Loomis did okay or better.)

Unfortunately, most other Loomis Sayles funds are load funds, although the 
loads may be waived if you are working with a financial advisor.

Merger Fund (MERFX)
The five managers of this fund look for news of corporate mergers and take-
overs. Taking advantage of their many years of experience with such deals, 
they’ve figured out the likely trajectories of the stock prices in both the fish 
about to be eaten and the soon-to-be-fattened fish. It sounds a bit crazy, but 
these guys have been doing it for nearly two decades, with fairly consistent 
results. In the past ten years, they lost money in only one year (2002, when 
the fund dropped 5.7 percent). Overall, like the Hussman Fund, this fund can 
be seen as a potential hedge against the stock market, because it tends to 
have little correlation to the stock market. On the other hand, you shouldn’t 
expect long-term performance on a par with the stock market. Keep your 
expectations for this fund modest, and you’ll do okay! I wouldn’t allocate 
more than 5 percent of my portfolio to the Merger Fund, and I would do so 
only within a tax-advantaged retirement account. The turnover is very heavy, 
which could result in your getting slammed at tax time.

T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation Fund (PRWCX)
The Baltimore-based fund company and financial supermarket takes a rea-
sonable approach to active investing, with low costs and a long-term strate-
gic approach to investing. The Capital Appreciation Fund has been around 
for many years and has proven itself a winner on a number of counts: perfor-
mance, limited volatility, and lack of correlation to the stock market. Whether 
the future will be as sweet as the past is unknowable, but if you are tempted 
to invest in an actively run, balanced fund, you could do a lot worse than the 
Capital Appreciation Fund. The turnover on this fund in 2007 was 53 percent, 
so I would strongly recommend that you use this fund only in a tax-advan-
taged account, such as your IRA.
What the fund invests in: About two-thirds of the fund is invested in the 
stocks of large, U.S. companies, mostly value companies. About one-third of 
the fund is invested in a combination of bonds and cash.

Vanguard PRIMECAP Core Fund (VPCCX)
You would expect Vanguard, the world’s largest purveyor of index mutual 
funds, to produce actively managed funds that somewhat resemble index 
funds. You’d be right. Vanguard’s managed funds are low priced (compared 
to most other actively managed funds) with reasonable turnover and gener-
ally good tax efficiency. And, yes, they tend to perform very well — in the 
case of the Vanguard PRIMECAP fund, very well indeed. Note, however, that 
the fund doesn’t have a very long track record. I would therefore probably 
not recommend this fund, except that it is a Vanguard product, which gives 
me the confidence to invest.

Part III: Drawing a Blueprint for Your Index Portfolio 
Spotting Irrational Despondency, and 
Tilting Your Portfolio Accordingly
In December 1996, with the stock market, and especially tech stocks, on 
a multi-year rage, then–Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan 
first used the phrase irrational exuberance. It seemed to Greenspan that the 
stock market, and particularly the tech sector, might be getting overheated. 
Investors, of course, paid little heed and continued to pour their money into 
dot-coms. Some of those same investors are still waiting to recoup their 
losses from what followed in 2000–2002.
Of course, it’s easy to say in retrospect that the tech bubble seemed certain 
to pop.
It wasn’t the first time, and it won’t be the last, that investors sink the lion’s 
share of their portfolios into whatever is hot hot hot. John Bogle, the founder 
of Vanguard and a great proponent of indexing and buy-and-hold investing, 
writes the following in The Little Book of Common Sense Investing (Wiley): 
“[D]uring the past 25 while the stock market index fund was providing an 
annual return of 12.3 percent and the average equity fund was earning an 
annual return of 10.0 percent, the average fund investor was earning only 7.3 
percent a year.” Why? As Bogle explains, “Fund investors have been chasing 
past performance since time eternal, allowing their emotions — perhaps even 
their greed — to overwhelm their reason.”
I contend — with some caution — that if investors by and large chase past 
performance (buying the hottest funds in the hottest sectors) and lose heav-
ily as a result, it may be possible to do just the opposite, using index funds 
to occasionally buy low and sell high, to wind up ahead of the game. Such a 
strategy is sometimes known as tactical asset allocation. I call it searching for 
irrational despondency. The strategy is hard to use and very easy to misuse, 
so I hesitate to bring it up. But because I do employ it myself, to a small 
degree, I feel the obligation to discuss it.
 
Here’s the strategy in a nutshell: After you have your optimal portfolio alloca-
tion (see Chapters 11 and 12), consider mild tilts and gentle tweaks if you see 
a particular industry sector (technology, energy, consumer staples), style 
(growth, value, large cap, small cap), or geographical area or country (Europe, 
Japan) dragging for some time seriously below its historical return rate, drag-
ging seriously below other kinds of investments, or (preferably) both. You 
are banking on a rule called reversion to the mean: If a particular asset class 
returned, say, an average of 10 percent a year for the past 80 years, and has 
seen a negative return over the past several years, a bounceback may be 
likely.

223
 Chapter 13: Mixing and Matching Passive and Active Investing
Discovering the secrets of 
tactical asset allocation
 
Mind you, picking market sectors likely to outperform the market isn’t easy, 
cannot be done mechanically, and will increase your portfolio risk. That being 
said, I do believe that you can juice your returns without too much added risk 
if you can keep your enthusiasm in check.
A good number of my colleagues, even those who, like me, are strong pro-
ponents of indexing, similarly see value in tactical asset allocation. “Markets 
with low price/earnings ratios tend to do better than markets with high price/
earnings ratios. Tilting your portfolio toward low price/earnings markets can 
boost performance,” says Harindra de Silva, Ph.D., CFA, portfolio manager 
with Analytic Investors, a Los Angeles–based investment management firm. 
The price/earning ratio (P/E), a standard measure of an index’s valuation, can 
readily be found on the fact sheet on any index mutual fund or ETF. The P/E 
ratio is something of a measure of the public’s exuberance or despondency 
for a stock or sector.
De Silva recommends that 70 to 80 percent of your portfolio remain static, 
invested in broad indexes at all times, at set allocations. The remaining 20 to 
30 percent may be invested specifically in indexes that seem beaten down. 
Your best bets, he says, will be asset classes that have been beaten down for 
a few years but have shown recent signs (in the past 12 months) of a turn-
around and appear to be on their way back up.
He cautions that such a strategy is not market timing, and it is not going to 
make you rich quick. “Done right, I believe that tactical asset allocation using 
index funds can add 1, perhaps 1.5 percent to your annual returns over time,” 
he says. But even the best tactical allocation strategists won’t always get it 
right. “Expect that you’re going to beat the broad indexes perhaps 55 to 60 
percent of the time,” he says. “Tactical asset allocation may not improve your 
bottom line until you’ve done it for a few years.”
Fine-tuning your portfolio tilting skills
Michael Kitces, CFP, is director of financial planning with the Pinnacle 
Advisory Group in Columbia, Maryland, and publisher of The Kitces Report 
(www.kitces.com). He agrees that tactical asset allocation can beat 
owning the entire market, but it must be done with care and finesse. “We 
have plenty of evidence that asset classes that have done poorly tend to do 
better moving forward,” he says. Part of the reason is that people get “overly 
gloomy” when an asset class tanks, and the valuations (P/E ratio) may 
become dirt cheap.

224
Part III: Drawing a Blueprint for Your Index Portfolio 
Still, says Kitces, identifying an overvalued asset class is difficult, and you are 
sure to sometimes get it wrong. He recommends that you lean your portfolio 
toward underperformers but set strict parameters for how much you’ll lean 
so that you don’t fall over backwards. “If you normally would want a port-
folio that is, say, 60 percent stock and 40 percent bonds, and you decide to 
overweight stocks, you might want to commit to staying within 10 percentage 
points of your neutral allocation,” he says. He recommends having similar 
parameters for U.S. versus foreign stocks and how much you may be willing 
to plunk into any one specific industry sector.
Like de Silva, Kitces also advises extreme patience. “I’m not suggesting 
market timing, and I’m not suggesting you’re going to get instant rewards. As 
with basic index investing, you are focusing on the long term. The rewards of 
portfolio tilting will come, but it may take considerable time.”
Searching the current landscape for opportunity
Let me offer an example of how tactical asset 
allocation can work. As I’m writing this chap-
ter, the two industry sectors most beaten down 
are the financial and banking industry and the 
housing-construction industry. Several ETFs 
allow you to tap into these industry sectors, 
and I’ve got my eye especially on the iShares 
Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB), 
a fund that tracks an index of companies such 
as Pulte Homes and Toll Brothers. At the start 
of 2007, shares of ITB were selling for more than 
$40. As I’m writing this chapter, they are going 
for around $14.50 — a drop of about two-thirds 
in value.
Granted, there are many reasons — good 
reasons — that the housing industry is in the 
doldrums. But could there be just a bit of irra-
tional despondency in the air? I think there just 
may be.
I wouldn’t take a huge bet on this ETF, but a 
small allocation may make sense. I have no 
idea what is going to happen to the hous-
ing industry in the next year or two. But I do 
know that as long as houses aren’t being built, 
demand will slowly build. When the economy 
turns around — and chances are pretty good 
that it will (no guarantees) — housing should 
turn around as well.
If I were to expect the stock market at large 
to return, say, 8 percent in the next four to five 
years, I would expect housing to do a wee bit 
better, maybe 9 or 10 percent. But I wouldn’t 
bank my house on that! If I want to lean my 
stock portfolio slightly toward this one sector, 
I’d invest maybe 5 percent of my stock allo-
cation into ITB — it could tweak my returns 
upward.

Chapter 14
Making Your Final Investment 
Decisions
In This Chapter
▶ Choosing between mutual funds and ETFs
▶ Selecting traditional or fundamental indexes
▶ Timing your purchases — or not
O
kay, Mr. or Ms. Primarily Index Investor, the time has come to choose. 
Which of the two major kinds of index investments — index mutual 
funds or exchange-traded funds — will get the bulk of your money?
And a much trickier and stickier question: Are you going to choose funds that 
are tracking traditional, older indexes, such as the S&P 500 and the Wilshire 
4500? Or are you going to pick funds that mirror the many newfangled fun-
damental indexes and, by so doing, shoot for potentially better performance 
than plain-vanilla indexing?
In this chapter, I aim to assist you in making both decisions, so you can be 
the strongest index investor possible. Ready or not, here we go . . .
But wait! I also explain in this chapter the timing of when to best launch your 
new index portfolio. Should it be today, regardless of where the markets were 
yesterday? Or should you wait for the stars over Wall Street to find just the 
right alignment? Answers are coming right up.

226
Part III: Drawing a Blueprint for Your Index Portfolio 
Making the Choice between 
Mutual Funds and ETFs
Don’t sweat the small stuff. For the buy-and-hold investor (which I hope, 
hope, hope you are), the difference between an index mutual fund and an 
exchange-traded fund (assuming that both track the same index and carry 
the same expense ratio) is akin to the difference in flavor between two 
brands of bottled water — not all that great.
 
At first, keep your eyes on the big picture, please. What kinds of invest-
ments are you choosing? (Stocks? Bonds? U.S.? Foreign?) What are the funds’ 
expense ratios? (Lower is better!) What sorts of indexes are being tracked? 
(I’ll get to that momentarily.) After you’ve tackled these bigger issues, you can 
spend a bit of energy deciding on whether you want a mutual fund or an ETF.
Tallying up your costs
 
The easiest guide to follow is that if you are investing in drips and drabs, or 
if you are taking out money at regular intervals, you want mutual funds, not 
ETFs. The costs of buying and selling ETFs, if you are doing so wholesale, will 
amount to too much. This is pretty straightforward math. If you have $1,000 
in an ETF, and you pay $10 per trade, making ten trades a year will add up to 
$100, or 10 percent of your investment. That would be an extremely costly 
way to invest.
What do you do for a living?
If you have strong economic ties to a certain 
industry (such as you work in the technology 
sector), and you have lots of company stock in 
your 401(k), you may want a portfolio that goes 
light on technology. If you have sizeable real 
estate holdings, you may want to avoid invest-
ing in REITs. If you work for a Swiss pharma-
ceutical company, and the company is loading 
you up with stock options, you may want to go 
easy on any investment in European stock index 
funds, and lean a little more than you normally 
would on U.S. and Asian indexes. The name of 
the game in successful investing is diversifica-
tion. And the best diversified portfolios — index 
or other — take into consideration your job or 
other personal links to the economy.

227
 Chapter 14: Making Your Final Investment Decisions
If you have $1 million to invest, however, the $10 trade cost becomes mar-
ginal. In this situation, any reduction in yearly fees (which you may be able 
to achieve with ETFs) may easily become more substantial. For example, if a 
mutual fund will cost you 3/10 of 1 percent a year, and an ETF will cost you 
2/10 of 1 percent, that’s 1/10 of 1 percent you have to play with. If making the 
trade to buy the ETF is going to cost you 1/10 of 1 percent, you’ll need only a 
year to make up the difference.
Adding up your total numbers
Generally speaking, for most folks, a diversified ETF portfolio will make the 
most sense for buy-and-hold investors with $50,000 portfolios or greater. 
Anything less than that, and you may want to consider index mutual funds or 
a mix of index mutual funds and ETFs.
If you have a substantial portfolio (several hundreds of thousands), look 
seriously at Vanguard Admiral shares. Available with most Vanguard index 
funds, they can wind up costing you even less than most ETFs (only about 
8/100 of 1 percent) if held in an account at Vanguard. (Holding Vanguard 
mutual funds at another brokerage house will mean added costs.)
If you’re just starting off as an investor, with several thousand or even just 
several hundred dollars, you may not have the minimum required to invest 
in most index mutual funds. In that case, you’re better off with one or two 
broad-based index ETFs. (See the examples I provide in Chapter 15.)
Avoiding the itch to rapid trade
One of the prime reasons that ETFs have exploded in popularity is that they, 
unlike mutual funds, can be traded throughout the day. Most people see this 
as a great benefit. If the market falls, you can sell! If the market rises, you can 
buy! Of course, as you know from reading the rest of this book, I’m not in 
favor of such impulsive moves. More often than not, they lead to investors 
shooting themselves in the financial foot.
 
If you have any gambling tendencies whatsoever, perhaps you are better off 
avoiding ETFs and using index mutual funds, just so you aren’t tempted to 
give in to panic at the worst times. Since index mutual funds can be bought 
and sold only at the end of the trading day, they can force impulsive investors 
to sit a few hours before making a rash decision.

228
Part III: Drawing a Blueprint for Your Index Portfolio 
Planning to pay less in taxes
 
Both index mutual funds and ETFs tend to be very tax efficient. In a retire-
ment account, where all your money is taxed as income when you withdraw 
it, the tax efficiency of a fund doesn’t really matter. But in a taxable account, 
it can matter greatly. I would therefore suggest that if all else is equal between 
two funds, one mutual fund and one ETF, and you are investing it in a taxable 
account, you may want to favor the ETF. That’s especially true if you are in a 
high tax bracket or live in a state, like Connecticut or New York, with a signifi-
cant income tax.
“There is a slight tax advantage to ETFs over index mutual funds,” says 
Jeffrey Ptak, an ETF analyst at Morningstar, “so if you are choosing between 
the two for a taxable account, that could give the ETF an edge.” The real tax 
differences, says Ptak, exist between actively run mutual funds and index 
funds. Actively run funds, which often rely on frequent trading, can be 
very tax inefficient. If you invest in them, placing them in a tax-advantaged 
account, such as your IRA, should be a priority.
Most index portfolios are, by their very nature, tax efficient, although some 
may be much more tax efficient than others. Taxable bonds are not tax effi-
cient, even if indexed. Neither are real estate investment trusts (REITs). And 
growth funds are generally more tax efficient than value funds because they 
pay fewer dividends.
Deciding between Traditional Indexes 
and Fundamental Ones
You may be aware that a raging controversy is brewing among investment 
professionals. Are the newer fundamental indexes, upon which many of the 
newer ETFs and several index mutual funds are based, superior to the tradi-
tional (cap-weighted) indexes we’ve been using for decades?
 
The answer: We’ll know for sure in about 20 years! In the meantime, I recom-
mend that you take a skeptical approach to any full-page advertisements 
claiming the raw superiority of one type of index over another.
Favoring a newer approach
On one side of the argument are such financial gurus as Robert Arnott and 
Jeremy Siegel. They admit that traditional index investing has done a great 
job but insist that traditional cap-weighted indexes are flawed, and that 

229
 Chapter 14: Making Your Final Investment Decisions
newer indexes based on other criteria can do better. The problem with tra-
ditional, cap-weighted indexes, they say, is that the most heavily weighted 
securities are those with the largest cap value, and that they get that huge 
cap value as a result of being overpriced. (That’s what they say . . . I’m not 
necessarily agreeing.)
So instead of weighting an index by cap size, Arnott and Siegel recommend 
other ways to weight companies. Siegel likes dividends. Siegel-inspired 
indexes are at the heart of most WisdomTree brand ETFs.
Arnott’s formula looks at revenue, book value (the company’s raw asset 
value), cash flow, and gross dividends. If you think Arnott is on to something, 
pick an ETF from PowerShares, or the new Charles Schwab or PIMCO mutual 
funds based on RAFI indexes.
There is also a whole lineup of ETFs — RevenueShares — based on indexes 
that weight companies according to their (you guessed it!) revenues.
Proponents of fundamental indexing “prove” that their way is better by back-
testing: creating charts showing theoretical returns as if their indexes existed 
5, 10, 20 years ago. This backtesting shows that the fundamental indexes 
yield bigger returns than the traditional S&P 500 or the Wilshire 4500.
The results of backtesting, and the results of forward-testing, however, have 
been known to diverge greatly.
Hugging onto the tried and true
Of course, traditional indexing doesn’t mean you have to invest in a single 
fund that mirrors the S&P 500 (against which the fundamental indexes are 
frequently compared). All sorts of traditional, cap-weighted indexes allow 
you to lean toward, say, small cap stocks or value stocks.
And that is one of the arguments being trumpeted against fundamental 
indexes. Financial gurus such as John Bogle (founder of Vanguard) and 
Burton G. Malkiel (author of A Random Walk Down Wall Street) argue that 
much of the backtesting that shows the alleged superiority of fundamental 
indexes is due to the fact that fundamental indexes tend to favor value stocks 
and small cap stocks.
But a larger part of their argument is that even if fundamental indexes bring 
extra juice to a portfolio, will they bring enough extra juice to compensate for 
certain drawbacks? The drawbacks they cite are higher management costs 
(cap-weighted indexes are very simple to maintain), higher portfolio turnover 
(there’s rarely a reason to change anything in a cap-weighted index), and a 
potentially higher tax burden (turnover can result in capital gains tax).

230
Part III: Drawing a Blueprint for Your Index Portfolio 
Who do you believe?
My take on fundamental indexing? It is promising. Some kinds of fundamen-
tal indexing may possibly prove superior to traditional indexing. But while 
we’re waiting for that proof, you’re probably better off with traditional, cap-
weighted indexes.
If, however, you have a hankering to “beat the markets,” using ETFs or index 
mutual funds linked to fundamental indexes may allow you a better chance 
than would an actively managed fund portfolio. It’s a way to quasi-index your 
money and still get off relatively cheaply, with limited managerial risk. Unlike 
active mutual funds, you know what you’re getting. I have no huge objections 
to building a portfolio of funds that mirror these indexes.
 
If I had to choose, I’d say Robert Arnott’s formulas make the most sense, at 
least on paper, of the newer fundamental indexes. Look for any funds that 
track a RAFI index. RAFI stands for Research Affiliates Fundamental Index. 
Arnott is the chair of Research Affiliates.
Should You Time Your Entry 
into the Markets?
A lot has been written about dollar-cost-averaging, and a lot of what’s been 
written is wrong. Yes, it makes sense to dollar-cost-average — to buy into the 
market over time — if you are socking away $X a week out of your paycheck. 
The beauty of dollar-cost-averaging is that your $X a week will tend to buy 
Equal-weighted indexes: Somewhat in-between 
traditional and fundamental
Equal-weighted index funds don’t necessarily 
aim to beat the market, as do fundamentally 
based index funds. Instead, they aim to more 
fairly represent the market, and give you more 
equal exposure and better diversification. In 
reality, because you get more small cap expo-
sure than you would with a cap-weighted, 
traditional index, equal-weighted indexes will 
tend to bring more volatility but potentially 
higher return. Nothing wrong with that, except 
that equal-weighted indexes must be regularly 
rebalanced to make sure that the components 
do have equal weight. That’s one reason per-
haps why the Rydex S&P Equal Weight Index 
ETF (RSP) has an expense ratio of 0.40, but the 
SPDR Trust Series 1 ETF (SPY), which tracks the 
same 500 stocks but cap-weights them, carries 
an expense ratio of 0.09 percent. All that trading 
brings other, largely unseen costs as well. I’m 
not a big fan of equal-weighted indexes.

231
 Chapter 14: Making Your Final Investment Decisions
the most shares during those weeks when shares are selling for cheap. Over 
the long run, you come out slightly ahead of where you would be if you pur-
chased the same shares willy-nilly.
So by all means, if you want to take a certain amount out of your paycheck 
each week and invest, do it! (Just be careful of the trading costs, as I discuss 
earlier in this chapter.) But what if you are sitting on a pile of cash? In that 
case, I contend, it doesn’t make sense to dole out your dollars slowly. If 
you’re ready to invest, just do it!
Taking the plunge
It isn’t just my opinion to take the plunge, of course. A good number of stud-
ies have shown that, if you have the cash, moving it into a balanced portfolio 
tomorrow, rather than waiting to do it over months or years, is usually — but 
not always — going to result in more money in your pocket. That’s largely 
because the market tends to go up more than it goes down. (Over the course 
of history, the market climbs about two out of every three days . . . pretty 
good odds, if you ask me!)
Of course, by taking the plunge, you are taking some risk that the stock 
market could tank tomorrow. But by having a well-diversified index portfolio, 
that risk is something you can mollify . . . to whatever degree you wish to 
mollify it.
Living with your decision
In my book — hey, this is my book! — index investing and buy-and-hold 
investing go hand-in-hand. Rather than trying to time the market, you buy the 
market . . . and today is the best day to do that.
In the next chapter, I pull together actual sample portfolios, culled from the 
real-life world of index investing. You may want to choose one based on the 
client descriptions, finding one that resembles you, and use the suggestions I 
provide to start your own index portfolio.
Counting the Number of 
Funds You’ll Be Buying
Two people may have everything in common to indicate that they should 
have similar portfolios, but someone with $10,000 will want to invest differ-
ently than someone with $1 million.

232
Part III: Drawing a Blueprint for Your Index Portfolio 
Trading off diversification 
for ease and economy
There is a tradeoff between optimal diversification (which may warrant a 
dozen or more index funds) and the costs and hassle involved with owning 
a whole bunch of holdings. Every time you rebalance (which I discuss in 
Chapter 16), you could face trading costs, either in the form of commissions 
(with ETFs), spreads (with either ETFs or mutual funds), or possibly other 
expenses. (You’ll incur fees, for example, if you buy or sell a Vanguard index 
fund that’s held at Fidelity or Charles Schwab.)
 
The size of your portfolio is an important consideration in deciding whether to 
own one index fund or (in the case of very large portfolios) a dozen or more.
Deciding between one index and many
 
As a rough rule, if you have $5,000 or less, you’re probably better off with 
perhaps one or two index funds. With a portfolio of $500,000, you should be 
looking at about a dozen, and as you reach $1 million (if you’re lucky enough 
to ever get there), you may want to think about 20 to 25 funds. Of course, for 
amounts in between, you should adjust accordingly.
In the next chapter, you find actual index portfolios, arranged by portfolio 
size. I start with smaller portfolios — those with less than $5,000 or so — and 
proceed to the $1 million and plus kitties. Somewhere in the selection of port-
folios I provide, you may find one that fits you fairly well.

index portfolios based on all the things that make an individual an individual.
At the end of this chapter, I ask you to take everything you’ve learned in this 
book and create a portfolio for yourself.
Investing with Small Change: 
Choosing an All-in-One ETF
I often get the question “How do I start investing?” It happened just the other 
day. I was having a bit of hip trouble, and as Roberto, my 29-year-old physical 
therapist, was yanking my leg back as far as it would go, he asked me how to 
get started in investing.

234
Part III: Drawing a Blueprint for Your Index Portfolio 
I told Roberto that the best way to get started in investing is to find out if 
his employer has a 401(k) plan and, if so, whether the employer provides 
matching funds. You simply can’t beat a guaranteed 50 percent immediate 
return anywhere on the planet.
In this case, Roberto told me that he had been on the job only for several 
months and wasn’t yet eligible for the 401(k). But, he explained, he had $500 
to invest. His question was, “What could I do with it?”
As I explained to Roberto, if we’re talking about several hundred dollars, 
and you’re just trying to get your feet wet, that’s a different ball of wax than 
building a serious portfolio.
 
If you have a bit of money that you won’t need in order to pay bills, then what 
the heck — go ahead and put it all into stocks. But, be sure you put it in a very 
well diversified stock portfolio. There is a single ETF that will do the trick: the 
Vanguard Total World Stock ETF. The fund offers exposure to nearly 2,000 
stocks from around the entire globe — roughly 40 percent U.S. and 60 percent 
everywhere else. VT (that’s called the fund’s ticker) is an ETF, which means 
you need to pay a commission to buy it. Do so online, and don’t pay more 
than $20 for the purchase. The fund then costs you only 0.25 percent a year in 
operating expenses. Not a bad way to get started!
Because it is all stock, this fund will be fairly volatile. But if you want 
diversification in a flash, there’s perhaps no better way to get it. (The 
Barclay’s iShares MSCI ACWI Index Fund [ACWI] is similar to the Vanguard 
fund. It costs 0.35 percent a year.)
Want to add bonds? The simplest stock-and-bond portfolio imaginable would 
be a combination of VT and the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND). 
That fund, which is exactly what the name implies, has an expense ratio of 
0.11 percent.
Sticking to the Simple and Easy
And now I’d like to continue this portfolio-building exercise by giving you 
two very sleek, elegant, yet adjustable portfolios, useful especially to those 
who don’t want to be bothered with a more complicated portfolio. Both are 
most appropriate for people with less than $100,000 to invest. If you have 
more than that amount, you can afford greater diversification, although these 
simple portfolios would certainly be adequate.

235
 Chapter 15: A Bevy of Sample Index Portfolios
The following two index portfolios — each with just seven holdings — can 
be adjusted to meet the needs of a conservative investor, a very aggressive 
investor, or anyone in between. The first portfolio is built of ETFs, and the 
second is built of index mutual funds. Favor the ETF portfolio if you intend 
to buy and hold, leaving your money untouched except for perhaps a yearly 
rebalance. Use the mutual fund portfolio if you will make regular deposits or 
frequent withdrawals.
Note: The mutual fund portfolio contains one ETF: the iShares MSCI EAFE 
Small Cap Index Fund (SCZ). The acronym EAFE stands for Europe, Australia, 
Far East (including Japan), and this particular ETF gives you exposure to 
smaller foreign companies. I believe it adds very important diversification to 
a portfolio, and there simply are no index mutual funds right now that do the 
same job.

Formulating a More Complex 
Index Strategy
If you have $100,000 or more to invest, I believe that adding several funds 
to the ones I suggest in the previous section provides diversification. Given 
the amounts of money involved, the increased hassle and the costs of hold-
ing the extra funds are worth it. In this section, I show you how to add index 
funds that allow you to build a portfolio that is aggressive, moderate, or con-
servative.

 Chapter 15: A Bevy of Sample Index Portfolios
Going for glory: Building an 
aggressive index portfolio
Generally speaking, the two kinds of people who warrant the most 
aggressive portfolios are the very young and the very rich. It’s something of 
a cruel paradox, but people who least need the potential return of a high-risk 
portfolio are just about the only ones who can afford to take that risk.
Take Mark and Elaine. They are, financially speaking (and by just about 
anyone’s definition), quite fortunate. Mark (58) works as a senior manager for 
a pharmaceutical company. He not only pulls in very big bucks but actually 
has a fixed pension, like many people had years ago but few do today. That 
pension will kick in when he retires in about five years. (If he retires before 
that time, he’ll get 80 percent of his salary.) Elaine (57) worked in real estate 
sales for a number of years and is no longer employed. Contrary to public 
wisdom that would put a couple in their mid- to late-50s into a conservative 
portfolio, Mark and Elaine actually warrant a quite aggressive portfolio.
The couple doesn’t mind the risk that comes with a predominantly stock 
portfolio. Chances are very small that they will ever need, in their entire 
lifetimes, any of the $1.5 million currently in their portfolio. As Mark 
explained to me, this savings is earmarked as a legacy — something to leave 
behind for the two kids, both currently in high school. (Mark’s $750,000 
salary with guaranteed pension will more than pay for college, including 
textbooks and milkshakes, and any other expenses that come up in the next 
decade.)
The couple’s portfolio is divided mostly between the two spouse’s tax-
advantaged IRAs, to which they have been contributing since their late 20s. In 
Figure 15-1, I show the investments I made on Mark and Elaine’s behalf. I put 
the U.S. growth index funds and the commodity fund (both very tax efficient) 
into Mark and Elaine’s taxable account, and everything else into the retire-
ment accounts.

✓ The standard deviation is 8.0, which means it’s slightly less volatile than 
the S&P 500.
A very similar aggressive portfolio may be appropriate for a 30-year-old with 
no children, no debt, a fair salary, and many years until retirement.

 Chapter 15: A Bevy of Sample Index Portfolios
Aiming for growth: Creating an aspiring 
but not too aggressive portfolio
Tom and Helene are by far more typical than Mark and Elaine. Tom (48) is a 
self-employed land surveyor. Helene (45) does freelance commercial writing. 
Together, they have cobbled together a portfolio of $445,000. They both enjoy 
what they do and have no dreams of early retirement. Still, their goal is to be 
economically self-sufficient within 12 years.
Given their yearly expenses of $70,000, I provided them with a ballpark figure 
of $1.4 million: When their portfolio gets to that size, more or less, they 
can work or not work. At the rate they are contributing to savings (roughly 
$30,000 a year), they will need to see an average annual return of about 8.0 
percent in order to get to the magic $1.4 number within 10 years. (I discover 
this fact with the help of my handy dandy HP12C financial calculator.)
Given that they are both self-employed with fairly predictable incomes, 
and their only debt is a mortgage, Tom and Helene are unlikely to need to 
touch their nest egg in the next dozen years. If they tap into it at that point, 
it should initially be for only a modest amount. This couple warrants a more 
middle-of-the-road portfolio than do Mark and Elaine. There’s no need to set 
the world afire with stratospheric returns. And unlike Mark and Elaine, a 
serious crash in the stock markets could most certainly adversely affect Tom 
and Helene.
Figure 15-2 shows how I divided up the moderate-growth portfolio I built for 
Tom and Helene.

Taking few chances: Erecting a (mostly 
indexed) portfolio with limited volatility
Richard just turned 62, isn’t too keen on working for any longer than he 
needs to, lives on $65,000 a year, and will not get any kind of pension when he 
retires from his job in newspaper production. Did I say retire? His job situa-
tion is anything but secure. Although Richard plans to work another three to 
four years, the future is anything but clear. If he loses his spot at the paper, 
Richard is uncertain that he’ll be able to find employment elsewhere, and it’s 
very unlikely that he’ll be able to match his $80,000 salary. His $600,000 port-
folio may have to support him for the rest of his life. If he can hang in there 
till age 65, his portfolio, along with Social Security, should be enough to com-
fortably get by. But there isn’t a lot of room for error.
Richard is conservative by nature and would lose sleep if the markets took 
a serious dive. I am therefore limiting his stock market exposure. Because 
he lives in a state with high income tax (New York) and a part of Richard’s 
portfolio is in a taxable retirement account, I have given him a position in a 
New York municipal index fund, which will yield tax-free income and provide 
some stability to the nest egg. Not eager to take on too much in the way of 
bonds, however, I have also put some of Richard’s money into a couple of 
non-indexed, hedge fund–like “market-neutral” funds. I’d like to see a slightly 
greater return from them than the bonds will provide, yet they’ll still provide 
ballast to the portfolio.
I’ve also given Richard a position in the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR 
ETF, a sector of the economy (toilet paper and such) that tends to hold its 
own fairly well, even in rough times.
Figure 15-3 shows what Richard’s overall portfolio allocation looks like.

 Chapter 15: A Bevy of Sample Index Portfolios
Your Personal Nest Egg
Using the sample portfolios in this chapter, I hope you can get a good feel for 
what your own index portfolio may look like. In this section, I give you a few 
more ideas for figuring out the details.
Looking over your financial 
situation carefully
As you begin to construct your own portfolio, ask yourself the following 
questions (which rarely come up in quick online questionnaires!). Based 
on your answers, adjust your portfolio toward more aggressive, more 
conservative, or perhaps just different allocations than you may find in the 
sample portfolios I present in this chapter. Under certain circumstances, you 
may want to build a portfolio that looks quite different from any of the ones 
I’ve shown you so far.
Russell’s “present and future” portfolio 
modeling technique
I find it makes enormous sense to map out 
today’s portfolio, as well as tomorrow’s, so 
that you know where your portfolio is headed. 
That way, you know which areas of your 
portfolio you’re looking to fatten up, and which 
can stand to go on a diet. That information 
can come in very handy at times when you 
are either contributing fresh funds or needing 
to make a withdrawal. For example, say you 
currently have $500,000 invested. When you 
reach $650,000, you’ll be that much closer to 
your ultimate goal — financial independence 
(retirement!) — and you figure (intelligently) 
that it will be a good time to turn down the risk. 
Your two-tier model portfolio may look like 
this:
The $500,000 portfolio you have today:
 ✓ U.S. stocks: 35 percent
 ✓ Foreign stocks: 30 percent
 ✓ REITs: 10 percent
 ✓ Bonds: 20 percent
 ✓ Commodities: 5 percent
The $650,000 portfolio you’ll have, whenever:
 ✓ U.S. stocks: 30 percent
 ✓ Foreign stocks: 20 percent
 ✓ REITs: 5 percent
 ✓ Bonds: 40 percent
 ✓ Commodities: 5 percent

244
Part III: Drawing a Blueprint for Your Index Portfolio 
 
✓ Is your job status shaky? Your investment timeframe, which might 
normally allow for an aggressive portfolio, may not be as long as you 
think. You may need to tap your nest egg sooner than anticipated. If 
that’s the case, you don’t want everything in stocks, which could be 
down on the day you get your pink slip.
 
✓ Are you expecting a fat inheritance? You can take more risk, and hope 
for greater return, than someone who isn’t expecting an inheritance.
 
✓ Are you getting stock options or company stock in your 401(k)? If you 
are overloaded with company stock, and you work for a large growth 
company, you may want a lesser amount of large growth stock in your 
portfolio than the next guy. Large growth stocks — which include your 
company stock — tend to move together.
 
✓ Are you the nervous type? Two people with very similar finances may 
not want the same portfolio. If you can’t handle the heat, be true to 
yourself. There’s no point losing sleep over an overly aggressive portfolio.
 
✓ Are you a land baron? If a lot of your net worth is tied up in real estate, 
lower (or even eliminate) your exposure to REITs. There’s no point in 
property overkill.
 
✓ Are you in a stratospheric tax bracket? High taxes warrant a serious 
look at municipal bonds. All things being equal, you may want to tune 
down your allocation to tax-inefficient funds, such as REITs and high-
dividend–paying funds.
Positioning your portfolio correctly
Remember, too, that where you put your funds can matter greatly over the 
long run. If you have both a tax-advantaged account, such as an IRA, and a 
non-retirement taxable account, you want the fixed income and high-dividend 
funds in the tax-advantaged accounts.
These funds are generally best in tax-advantaged retirement accounts:
 
✓ Taxable bonds
 
✓ REITs
 
✓ Value stocks (with high dividends)
 
✓ Non-indexed (actively managed) mutual funds 
These funds are generally best in non-retirement taxable accounts:
 
✓ Municipal tax-free bonds
 
✓ Growth stocks
 
✓ International stocks

Ensuring Happy 
Returns

In this part . . .
C
are and maintenance are the hot topics of this part of 
the book. I start with the assumption that you’ve 
digested the knowledge necessary to build a solid index 
portfolio, and you’d like to know what comes next.
In Chapter 16, I discuss the importance of having a portfo-
lio plan and sticking to it. It’s advice you’ve perhaps 
heard before, but I present it in a manner that makes it 
(I hope) both palatable and digestible. I fully realize that 
sitting tight on a portfolio through tough times requires 
resolve, and I invite you to read and reread this chapter 
as the years roll by. In Chapter 17, I talk about investment 
professionals of various shapes and sizes who may help 
you — or harm you! — in your index investing adventures 
to come. You want to make sure you can distinguish the 
helpers from the harmers.

But It Really Works
In This Chapter

▶ Knowing when you need to tinker
▶ Keeping an eye on Father Time
▶ Eyeballing economic trends
O
h yes, there can be a certain adrenaline rush to buying and selling 
securities. You watch the prices rise. And (gulp) fall. And then, perhaps, 
rise again. You carefully time your move. Fingers on the keyboard, eyes on 
the monitor, you race in for the kill . . . the quick and fat profit. Sometimes, 
when the going is good, you may just get your profit. Unfortunately, frenetic 
activity where stocks or bonds are concerned is wrought with peril. Over 
time, because trading costs money, and because you are (whether or not 
you know it) competing against pros, losses tend to exceed profits by a good 
margin.
Trust me on this, please. You’ll find few frequent traders on Easy Street. 
Heck, even the pros themselves fail most of the time, as proven by the 
inability of actively managed funds to even match the indexes. (I discuss this 
topic in depth in earlier chapters.)
Indexes? Did someone just mention indexes? Index investing offers no big 
rush of adrenaline, but over time, profits tend to exceed losses. And that’s 
why you, as a smart investor, have chosen to build an index portfolio.
I now wish to speak about your index portfolio’s proper maintenance and 
feeding. An index portfolio, like a planted cactus, doesn’t require all that 
much attention . . . hardly more than the patience to watch it grow, and some 
very occasional care.
On the following pages, I provide care instructions.

248
Part IV: Ensuring Happy Returns 
Keeping Your Eyes Firmly on the Future
Lest you have any doubt, I’m something of a traditional guy where it comes 
to index investing. While many of the newer index products on the market — 
namely, ETFs that track every conceivable market and submarket in every 
conceivable way — are designed for easy buying and selling, easy buying and 
selling is not such a good thing.
 
The tried and true, the proven-beyond-a-shadow-of-a-doubt strategy that 
ensures you’ll be one of the most successful investors in your neighborhood, 
is a long-term, buy-and-hold strategy — a strategy that proved itself long 
before ETFs ever existed.
Index investing largely works because it equates to lower managerial 
expenses, lower trading costs, and lower taxes. The frequent trading of 
higher-priced index products can — and often does — easily negate all three 
of these advantages. On the other hand, wisely chosen index funds, allowed 
to do what they do best — earn interest or dividends and grow in price over 
time — allow you to tap into the surest money-making strategy you’ll find 
anywhere.
Will you make money every month or every year as an index investor? No, of 
course not. That’s where patience plays a key role.
Disaster-proofing your portfolio
It’s easy to have patience when times are good. During a bull market, most 
people, indexers and active investors alike, not only put their money into 
the markets, they often put too much into the markets. During the bad times, 
however, people tend to panic. We’ve seen it time and time again: As stock 
prices plummet, investors move their money to cash (money-market funds, 
CDs, savings accounts, or literally cash . . . bills under the mattress). When 
stock prices rise again, investors move their money from cash and back to 
stocks. Over time, this is a losing formula. Even index investors who play 
this game lose. You’re forever cashing out when things are bad (and prices 
are low) and buying back when things are good (and prices are high). Do the 
math!
 
To be a successful investor of any sort, you need to have a portfolio that you 
can live with in good times and bad . . . the kind of portfolio that you won’t be 
inclined to abandon. This is the best way to prevent yourself from panicking 
(and lifting that mattress) when Wall Street hits the skids.

249
 Chapter 16: Buying and Holding: Boring, But It Really Works
 
So be honest with yourself. If you think your blood pressure may shoot 
through the roof and sweat will form on your brow if your portfolio were to 
lose 10 percent in the next year, you may not really want an 80/20 (80 percent 
stock, 20 percent bonds) portfolio. You may be better off with a more sedate 
60/40 portfolio.
A person’s emotional makeup is critical to choosing the optimal portfolio.
Ignoring the hoopla and hype
Panicking during a bear market and throwing your portfolio all into cash isn’t 
the only mistake an index investor can make. Many people have been known 
to have a solid plan in place, only to blow it by suddenly taking a gamble on, 
say, 5,000 shares of some high-tech company in Mexico City or Hong Kong 
that “Mad Money” host Jim Cramer or the brother-in-law who works in insur-
ance assures will soon shoot through the ceiling. (Jimbo himself is way too 
smart to invest in this company, and the brother-in-law allegedly doesn’t 
have the money, but that won’t stop them from insisting that you take the 
plunge.)
 
As oil and gold prices have risen in recent times, providers of commodity 
funds have tried to sell investors on their products. It can sometimes be an 
easy sale because their fancy charts and graphs “prove” how much better 
you’d be with 40 percent of your portfolio in their funds. (As I’m writing these 
words, you would have been better off if you bought their funds two years 
ago!) Ditto for real estate funds. Or for healthcare funds. Remember that 
different asset classes do better or worse during certain periods. You can’t 
assume that past performance, especially short-term past performance, is at 
all indicative of what may happen tomorrow.
 
Because we as human beings are so susceptible to hype, I suggest you try 
to shield yourself from it as much as possible. Don’t watch Jim Cramer. Shut 
off the TV when you hear his shouting. Don’t pay attention to the myriad 
advertisements for actively managed funds (or narrow index funds) that 
tout the past few months’ (or even the past few years’) performance. Ignore 
altogether ads with testimonials (“JR from Denver”) from people who claim 
to have made a mint actively trading and claim that you can do the same by 
subscribing to such-and-such newsletter.
Don’t buy the hype.

250
Part IV: Ensuring Happy Returns 
Rebalancing on a Regular Basis
Even a cactus occasionally needs water. And even the best designed and 
carefully allocated index portfolio needs attention. The problem with letting 
things slide altogether is that one or several of your investments will do better 
than the rest. Your large cap stocks, for example, may do significantly better 
than your small cap stocks. Your foreign stocks may do better than your 
domestic stocks. Or your bonds may rise, and your stocks may fall. In any of 
these cases, your carefully constructed portfolio will find itself out of whack.
Failing to rebalance could mean that you are taking on added risk as your 
diversification dissolves and you become too heavily weighted in one or several 
types of investment. A second reason for rebalancing: It forces you, despite 
whatever your emotions are telling you, to sell off the recent overachievers 
and buy up the underachievers. Over the years, you’ll find yourself buying low 
and selling high (the direct opposite of what most people do!). That process of 
buying low and selling high, sometimes known as the rebalancing bonus, may add 
as much as a full percentage point to your long-term annual average returns.
 
There are two ways to rebalance your portfolio. Fortunately, both methods 
are fairly easy to do, especially when your portfolio consists of wisely chosen 
index funds that represent crisp and clear asset classes.
The first, more common, method is to attack your portfolio allocations 
according to the calendar . . . say once a year, or every 18 months. The other 
strategy is to eyeball your portfolio more regularly, and rebalance if and 
when things get out of whack, regardless of whether that’s a year from the 
last time you rebalanced or a week and a half. Both methods have their fans, 
and neither is necessarily better than the other. Which is better for you will 
depend on several factors.
Using the calendar to keep your 
portfolio on an even keel
If you use the calendar method, most financial advisors would suggest you 
rebalance either every year or every 18 months. I think that 18 months is fine 
for most folks. If you are living off your portfolio and need to raise regular 
cash, you may consider doing it every six months. The advantage to using 
the calendar is that it gives you a certain discipline and tends to result in less 
trading (with fewer trading costs and taxes) than using the as-needed basis. 
The calendar method also makes sure that you don’t rebalance too often, 
which allows you to take advantage of the momentum that sometimes drives 
investments north over a period of months.

251
 Chapter 16: Buying and Holding: Boring, But It Really Works
If you use the calendar method, I suggest that you consider buying or selling 
any piece of your portfolio (such as, for example, a large cap growth index 
fund) that has shrunk or grown more than 10 percent away from its target 
position. In other words, if your portfolio plan allocates 20 percent to large 
cap growth, consider buying or selling should your position be greater than 
22 percent or fall short of 18 percent.
But don’t be too rigid about that 10 percent plan. . . . Someone with a smaller 
portfolio, or someone with an ETF rather than a mutual fund portfolio, may 
want to use 15 percent. The smaller your portfolio, the smaller the positions, 
and the greater your trading costs may be. You obviously don’t want to 
spend $10 to trade $100 worth of a single index ETF.
Adjusting your portfolio 
on an as-needed basis
The other way to attack the rebalancing issue is to ignore the calendar and 
do your juggling just as soon as you note a large enough swing to warrant a 
buy or sell. Doing it this way allows for a potentially larger rebalancing bonus 
but risks eating up that bonus with trading costs and added taxation. Plus, 
you may lose out on the momentum that drives some securities higher than 
they sometimes should probably go.
So which method of rebalancing is best?
The better method will depend on several factors:
 
✓ How large is your portfolio? Larger portfolios can be rebalanced with 
greater frequency.
 
✓ Do you pay for trades, and if so, how much? I would never make any 
trade that cost me more than, say, 1/5 of 1 percent of what I was trading. 
In other words, a $10 trading commission is okay to buy or sell $10,000 
of a security (that’s 1/10 of 1 percent), but I wouldn’t incur a $10 com-
mission to buy or sell $1,000 of a security (that’s a full percentage point). 
Index mutual fund portfolios, provided there’s no cost to trade, may be 
rebalanced more frequently. Ditto for an ETF portfolio if it’s kept at (no 
commission) www.zecco.com or a brokerage house that charges you a 
nominal amount.
 
✓ Are your investments in a taxable or tax-advantaged account? If 
they’re in a taxable account, you need to be more careful of short-term 
trades that could result in short-term capital gains taxes.

252
Part IV: Ensuring Happy Returns 
 
✓ How volatile is your portfolio? A portfolio of all bonds — one 
corporate bond index fund, one Treasury bond index fund, and one 
municipal bond index fund — requires rebalancing less often than a 
portfolio of tech stocks, commodities, and emerging-market stocks.
 
✓ Are you taking money out or adding money regularly to the portfolio? 
Either way, you may want to rebalance more often.
Tweaking Your Allocations 
as the Years Go By
If you’ve ever filled out one of those online, quick-and-dirty, build-your-own 
portfolio tools, you know that age is almost always the first question you are 
asked. Sometimes, it is the only question you are asked!
The common wisdom has it that the older you get, the more conservative your 
portfolio should be. There’s some truth to that (see Part III), but age is only one 
factor that you want to look at in determining your optimal portfolio.
Bucking the common wisdom
So, what changes to your index portfolio do you want to make as you get 
older? I suggest that you make far fewer changes than the common wisdom 
dictates! Age itself doesn’t mean, for example, that you want to rush from 
stock index funds to bond index funds.
Yes, you generally want a more conservative portfolio (more bonds and cash, 
less stock, less exposure to commodities) as you reach your ultimate financial 
goals, which, for most people, include having a portfolio large enough to not 
have to work for money. At that glorious point, after all, you start having more 
to lose than you have to gain.
A financial planning colleague of mine, William P. Bengen, CFP, has made 
something of a career out of crunching the numbers and figuring out what 
kinds of portfolios last the longest in all kinds of economic climates. What he 
finds is that those people with the most aggressive portfolios (say, 100 percent 
stock) should start to shave off 2 percentage points of stock each year as soon 
as they get within 15 years of retirement.
In other words, if you have 10 years till retirement, you may want as much as 
90 percent stock, with 10 percent bonds. If you are within 5 years of retirement, 
you may consider 80 percent stock with 20 percent bonds.

253
 Chapter 16: Buying and Holding: Boring, But It Really Works
Entering the golden years
What happens on the day you retire and start withdrawing money from your 
index portfolio? At that point, says Bengen, his exhaustive studies show that 
a portfolio of roughly 60 percent stock and 40 percent bonds is where you 
have the best chance of seeing your portfolio survive for the longest time. 
You’ll have enough bonds to keep your portfolio afloat in times the stock 
market does poorly, and you’ll have enough stock to keep your portfolio 
ahead of inflation and to supply you with the cash you need.
 
If you’re fortunate enough to have a very healthy nest egg, I encourage you 
to tweak your portfolio upon retirement so that you have ten years of living 
expenses in high-quality bond index funds. If you have that, and only if you have 
that, consider getting more aggressive than Bengen’s suggested 60/40 mix. Ten 
years of living expenses in quality bonds pretty much assures you that whatever 
the economic climate, you’ll have enough to pay for the necessities of life.
Where do smart indexing retirees get their 
spending money from?
One costly mistake made by even the smartest 
investors is to confuse income with cash flow. 
A bond index fund generally produces much 
more income than a stock index fund. But a 
stock index fund generally produces greater 
long-term capital appreciation. For some 
reason, many retirees think that it is okay to 
touch the income from the bonds but not okay 
to touch the capital appreciation on the stocks. 
The explanation I’ve heard from some is this: 
”Well, Russell, if I sell off the stocks, I’m selling 
a productive asset. If I use just my bond income, 
I’m not.” It sort of sounds logical, but it really 
isn’t. Not at all.
If you are living off your portfolio, it makes the 
most sense to rebalance every six months or so, 
selling off whichever of your index funds have 
outperformed the others. If you started the six 
months with the bond funds at 30 percent, and 
now they are worth 35 percent of your portfo-
lio, sell bonds. If stocks started at 70 percent 
of your portfolio and are now at 75 percent, sell 
stocks. That way, you keep your portfolio risk 
constant, you sell off your highest performing 
assets, and you raise the cash you need.
Don’t differentiate so much between interest on 
bonds and capital appreciation on stocks. You 
want a portfolio with the highest possible total 
return. That generally means more stock and 
less bonds than you find in a typical conserva-
tive retiree’s portfolio.

Part IV: Ensuring Happy Returns 
Gauging Economic Trends
Active investors are forever looking at economic indicators, trying to time 
the markets or figure out what kind of around-the-corner economic climate 
may warrant what kind of trading. As an index investor, you don’t need to 
worry too much about economic indicators, most of which aren’t terribly 
indicative of anything. But can you ignore the economy altogether? No, that 
may be going a tad far.
To what extent should index investors be concerned with economic trends?
Trends matter and matter greatly, but predicting trends is very difficult. I 
wouldn’t attempt it often, if ever. However, here I show you a few economic 
indicators worth an occasional look, which may possibly prompt a tweak to 
your carefully constructed index portfolio.
Considering price/earning (P/E) ratios
All sorts of events and formulas have been used to predict stock market 
returns — you name it, from which league wins the World Series in any given 
year to U.S. presidential cycles to weather patterns in lower Manhattan. 
(There actually is some evidence that the market does better when the sun 
shines over Wall Street.) But by and large, these theories are bunk.
One fairly good predictor has been rather well studied, however, and that is 
prevailing P/E ratios. P/E stands for price over earnings:
P/E Ratio = Price per Share / Annual Earnings per Share
 
No, you can’t use P/E ratios to forecast next Wednesday’s stock market! But if 
you want to forecast market returns over, say, the next decade or so, knowing 
what P/E ratios are today may actually have some limited predictive value.
Price per share refers to the market price of any stock or basket of stocks. 
Annual earnings per share refers to the net income of a company or group 
of companies for the past 12 months, divided by the number of outstanding 
shares. In other words, P/E ratios measure how expensive a stock or group 
of stocks may be in relation to the earnings power of the company or compa-
nies behind the stock. As Yale researcher Robert Shiller put it, a high P/E is 
something of an indication of the market’s irrational exuberance. A low P/E 
may indicate irrational despondency.

255
 Chapter 16: Buying and Holding: Boring, But It Really Works
Shiller’s studies and others show fairly conclusively that a low P/E for the 
overall stock market is a fairly good bellwether that the following decade 
will show better-than-average returns. And conversely, high P/Es, such as we 
saw in the late 1990s, indicate that the following decade may see less-than-
average returns. (As I write this, it certainly looks like that prediction is going 
to pan out.)
Moral of story: You may want to tweak your portfolio, ever so slightly, 
toward a more aggressive stance if the market’s overall P/E is low. And you 
may want to tweak it, ever so slightly, toward a more conservative position if 
the P/E is riding exceptionally high. The average P/E for the S&P 500 over the 
past several decades is about 15. It is, at the time of this writing, just about 
15. In the late 1990s, it was up to about 32.
If, for example, your normal allocation would call for 65 percent stock, and 
the P/E for the market dips to 14 or even lower, you may want to up your 
stock allocation to 70 percent. If corporate earnings start to dip but market 
prices rise, and the P/E therefore climbs into the 20s, you may want to scale 
back to, say, 60 percent stock.
You may also want to very slightly overweight markets (Europe, for example) 
where the P/E is riding lower than elsewhere on the planet.
Want an easy way to find P/E ratios for the large indexes? Go to http://
finance.yahoo.com, and search for an ETF that tracks the index you’re 
interested in. No, the ETF and the index itself won’t have the exact same P/E, 
but the number will be awfully close.
Note: You’ll often see the notation P/E (ttm). Those last three letters stand 
for trailing twelve months. That retrospective formula is the most common 
formula for determining P/E.
Here are a few ETFs that you may want to use to see how the P/E of the 
market stands.

Noticing the interest yield curve
Under most economic skies, the interest curve on bonds — the relation-
ship between the long-term bond rates and short-term bond rates — slopes 
upward to the right. In other words, long-term bonds pay higher interest 
rates than short-term bonds do. That’s the norm. But it isn’t always so. 
Sometimes, such as was the case throughout most of 2007, the yield curve 
flattens. At very rare times, you may even see a higher return on short-term 
bonds than long-term bonds.
Don’t be obsessed with the yield cure, but don’t ignore it either.
Long-term bonds generally pay higher interest rates because the issuers are 
asking you to tie your money up for longer and to take additional risks by 
so doing. If the yield curve is flat, it makes less sense to invest in long-term 
bonds. But it still makes sense! If, for example, interest rates were to plum-
met, the total return on your long-term bonds, regardless of interest pay-
ments, would likely skyrocket.
 
So don’t trash your long-term bonds, by any means, should the yield curve 
flatten. But you may possibly want to lighten up. If, for example, your normal 
allocation calls for one-third short-term bonds (available and recommended 
in index fund form) and two-thirds long-term bonds (also purchased as an 
index fund), you may want to tweak that allocation a bit. You could go, say, 
to three-quarters long-term bonds if long-term bonds are paying higher 
interest rates. If not, you may want to divide your bond portfolio in half, 
lessening the longer-term bonds for the time being and going with the 
less-volatile short-term index options.
Check out the yield curve on bonds by going to the free Bloomberg site: 
www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates.
Respecting reversion to the mean
One of the most powerful forces in both nature and finances is reversion to the 
mean. Say a particular industry sector or style of investment has returned an 
average of 10 percent a year for the past 100 years, but in the past three years 
it has jumped 100 percent. That comparison tells you something. If the asset 
class has returned an average of 15 percent a year for the past many decades 
but has languished in the past three years, that tells you something, too.
You can never tell when something will return to the mean. A certain asset 
class may outperform its norm for years on end (think tech stocks in the 
1990s). But eventually, the forces of the universe seem to dictate that there 
will be a magnetic pull toward the mean.

257
 Chapter 16: Buying and Holding: Boring, But It Really Works
What’s that mean to you? Consider lightening up a wee bit on those portions of 
your portfolio that have soared beyond their norms for the past several years. 
Consider beefing up just a tad on those sectors that seem to have languished 
for so long. For example, if your REIT index fund were to lose 50 percent in a 
three-year period, you may consider giving it a 10 percent allocation in your 
stock portfolio rather than the normal 8 percent. If your small cap growth 
index fund has beaten the pants off all your other style index funds (large cap 
and value stocks) for the past two or three years running, you may give small 
growth a 6 percent allocation in your portfolio rather than the normal 8 percent.
Once again, I’m asking you to do the opposite of what most investors do!
 
It is hard to buy more of a fund that has lost money for you and to sell a recent 
winner, but by doing so, you’ll fare way better than most investors!
Noting Positive Changes 
in the Indexing Industry
New index products have been popping up like mushrooms after a rainstorm. 
Although the index products I recommend in this book are the best the market 
has to offer, keep your eyes open (see Appendix C for indexing Web sites to 
visit), and take note when possibly superior products may hit the streets.
Costs, costs, costs
Remember that a key advantage to index investing is the low cost. Some 
of the index products I recommend in Part II and Part III may be faced with 
tough competition in the years to come. If two index funds look and feel very 
similar, and one costs half what the other costs . . . well, I don’t need to tell 
you what to do.
Diversification opportunities
With more than 700 ETFs on the market, you’d think that every kind of worth-
while investment would be indexed by now. Not so. Oh, there are many non-
worthwhile kinds of investments you can invest in! But as yet, for example, you 
have very limited offerings in the way of international small cap stocks and 
tax-free municipal bonds (especially state-specific municipal bonds). I expect a 
variety of ETFs in these areas in the near future. Keep your eyes open.
One investment product I’d love to see: An inflation-protected, tax-free, 
municipal bond index fund. It will come in time.

Seeking Additional Assistance 
from Professionals . . . Carefully
In This Chapter
▶ Determining your need for help
▶ Avoiding scams
▶ Finding just the help you may need
S
omehow, as a child during the Johnson administration, I got my hands 
on a small booklet that had a corny title — something like “Healthy 
Eating for a More Vibrant You.” In this booklet were all kinds of helpful tips 
for eating healthy breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and snacks. It consisted 
largely of daily schedules, a sample of which I reproduce here. (Note: If you 
were born after 1970, you probably won’t believe it, but “healthy eating” 
looked very different when we Boomers were kids; it really did include things 
like bacon and toast with butter.)
MONDAY
Breakfast
2 eggs
2 strips of bacon
1 glass of orange juice
1 slice of toast with butter
2–3 cups of delicious hot tea (lemon optional)
Morning snack
1 cup of pudding or four cookies
1–2 cups of tasty hot tea (milk optional)

260
Part IV: Ensuring Happy Returns 
Lunch
1 bologna or roast beef sandwich
1 slice of cheese
1 apple or pear
2–3 cups of scrumptious iced tea (sugar optional)
Anyway, you get the picture. The booklet was published — surprise! — by the 
American Tea Council, or something like that. And it bears a lot of resemblance 
to (and is no less silly than) what most often passes for investment advice 
these days. You tell me who is giving the advice and who is signing that person’s 
paycheck, and I’ll tell you what kinds of investments are being suggested.
News flash! Most investment professionals are something less than hog wild 
about low-cost index products. They just love costly actively managed funds — 
as much as the American Tea Council loves tea.
I’m not saying that there aren’t good investment advisors out there, both 
knowledgeable and objective. I like to think that I’m one! I’m only saying that 
you are going to have to do some work to find a really good advisor, someone 
who knows his stuff and can share what he knows objectively. In this chapter, 
I outline the steps you can take to begin such a quest for such a good soul. I 
also help you to decide if you need a professional in the first place. Certainly, 
not everyone does. And finally, I give you a clue as to what you should be 
paying for help, if you need it.
Sizing Up Your Need for a Helping Hand
Using the tools available in this book, you can build yourself a first-class 
index portfolio, and you can maintain it. And you can probably do a great job. 
(Thank me later!) So why the heck would you even consider a professional’s 
help? Here are four possible reasons:
 
✓ A good investment advisor can help you fine-tune your portfolio, 
possibly using state-of-the-art investment software, to build a slightly 
better index portfolio than you could do on your own. A competent 
investment advisor will look at your personal finances in the broadest 
sense (including everything from insurance policies to terms of your 
mortgage) and perhaps have a better idea than you do of just where 
your risk–return sweet spot should be — how much risk you should be 
taking for how much potential return.
 
✓ An investment advisor, like an exercise coach, can not only set you up 
with the best “exercises,” but he or she can also help to monitor your 
progress and make sure that you stay the course. If you’re paying 

261
 Chapter 17: Seeking Additional Assistance from Professionals . . . Carefully
someone to help with your portfolio, you’re more apt to also pay 
attention to that portfolio! After you’ve hired a professional, there’s no 
more procrastinating about your investments.
 
✓ An investment advisor can potentially help save you time and energy. 
Doing a portfolio right, rebalancing regularly, making sure you have the 
best index investment products available, tax harvesting at the end of 
the year . . . you may be able to do it all yourself, but a professional can 
save you a fair amount of effort. With a good investment advisor on your 
side, you can also save time by not having to constantly keep abreast of 
new financial products, new tax laws that may change your investment 
strategy, and so on.
 
✓ Many investment professionals (I’m thinking of true financial planners 
now) can not only help set up and maintain your portfolio, but may also 
be helpful in reducing your taxes, providing estate and insurance advice, 
finding a mortgage, and so on. Granted, you can pay for such types of 
advice separately — and perhaps you should — but in the real world, 
they often come as a package deal.
Assessing your knowledge and interest
The first thing you want to look at in deciding whether to hire an advisor is 
your level of ease with handling financial matters. Do you feel that you under-
stood most of what you read in this book so far? Do you have a desire to get 
your hands dirty? Do you have the time and energy to keep track of your port-
folio? If so, you may be a good candidate to handle your own index portfolio.
Also ask yourself if you believe that you really have the resolve it takes to be 
a good investor. If you are prone to rash decisions, making decisions based 
on emotion rather than reason, you may be better off having someone to 
hold your hand, especially during the rough times. Be honest with yourself.
Assessing your wealth
 
Plain and simple, if you have less than $50,000 to invest, I encourage you 
to build an index portfolio on your own using the information in this book. 
Between $50,000 and $150,000, you’re in the in-between zone. If you have over 
$150,000, you may start to benefit by hiring a fee-only consultant to work with 
you on an hourly basis, at least to set up an initial portfolio. And before even 
considering handing your money over to an advisor to actually manage (an 
arrangement typically called “assets under management”), I would suggest 
that you have a portfolio of at least $200,000.
If you don’t know what fee-only means, well, I explain that in just a moment.

262
Part IV: Ensuring Happy Returns 
Asking Where the Money Comes From
As someone determined to be an index investor, whether you know it or not, 
you’ve already eliminated about two-thirds of all the investment advisors in the 
nation. You won’t want to work with them. They won’t want to work with you. 
That’s because a majority of investment professionals (at least 60 percent) 
work either entirely or partially on commission. Index investment products — 
at least good index investment products (good for YOU, that is) — don’t charge 
high enough fees to afford anyone a commission.
 
Fee-only means that an advisor takes no commissions and works only for the 
money he or she charges you. A fee-only advisor is therefore much more likely 
to work with index funds than a commissioned advisor.
Now, just to completely confuse you, commissioned advisors may sometimes 
be referred to as fee-basis advisors. So here’s what you must remember: Fee-
only = no commissions. Fee-basis = commissions. Got that? Good!
Finding out how the advisor 
expects to be paid
 
If you wind up talking to a fee-basis or full commission advisor, you have 
a right to know exactly what kind of pay he or she is getting for selling you 
your investments. Ask! And don’t settle for anything less than a specific 
number. Whatever that number is, just remember that you are paying for that 
commission. It may be indirect, but you are paying all the same.
Fee-only advisors will tell you what they charge up front. But even among 
fee-only advisors, there are differences in how they are paid. The vast majority 
of fee-only advisors charge in one of three ways:
 
✓ Assets under management: You pay a percentage of the size of your 
portfolio. This is usually a sliding scale. The more you have, generally, 
the lower the percentage. A typical fee may be 1 percent a year for 
assets under $500,000, 0.75 percent for assets $500,000 to $1,000,000, 
and 0.50 percent for assets greater than $1,000,000. Although these rates 
are typical, I also believe that they are too high.
 
 You should never pay more than 0.50 percent for asset management 
alone. If a financial planner is also giving you regular advice on taxes, 
estate matters, insurance, and such, that’s another story. But 1 percent 
for asset management is a high hurdle for you to jump.
 
 Most advisors who charge based on a percentage of assets under 
management will expect to be paid four times a year.

263
 Chapter 17: Seeking Additional Assistance from Professionals . . . Carefully
 
✓ Hourly basis: Hourly fees generally range from $150 to $300 an hour. 
Some advisors require a minimum number of hours in order to meet 
with you — usually two to three hours.
 
✓ Per job: You may be asked to pay, say, $3,000 a year for portfolio 
management, regardless of portfolio size. Or you may pay $2,000 to have 
a portfolio set up and then an additional $1,500 a year for management. 
If the advisor does comprehensive financial planning (reviewing your 
insurances and wills and such), that work may be charged for separately.
 
Most fee-only advisors prefer to charge based on assets under management. I 
believe that most investors, and especially index investors, may be better off 
doing the grunt work themselves (filling out paperwork, making trades) and 
hiring the professional on an hourly basis to provide advice.
But good, hourly fee-only advisors are hard to find. There’s more money to 
be had in taking assets under management. Also, hourly consultants (and I 
include myself here, although I also take assets under management) often get 
frustrated with clients who pay for good advice and then feel a need to be 
selective in the advice they choose to take. I know a number of hourly consul-
tants who later decided to switch to strictly assets under management.
Eliminating biases that could harm you
A fee-only advisor may have his or her biases — we all do — but I firmly 
believe that you are more likely to get objective investment advice by paying 
for investment advice directly, rather than working through someone who 
earns a commission from what you decide to buy.
As I’ve already noted, most index investment products would earn little or 
no commission to advisors, and those that do pay a commission to advisors 
aren’t going to be the best products for you.
I’m not saying that you can’t get objective investment advice from someone 
who stands to make more money by steering you toward certain products, 
but the chances aren’t in your favor. You may, in fact, wind up with “tea,” 
“tea,” and more “tea.”
Using free services from a brokerage house
Large financial supermarkets often offer free investment advice to their cus-
tomers, especially larger customers. What the heck . . . take it if it’s free! But 
do realize that you’ll be on the receiving end of a strong bias toward each 
brokerage house’s own funds, and they generally won’t be index funds.
Take whatever free advice you get for what it’s worth.

264
Part IV: Ensuring Happy Returns 
Sifting Through the Alphabet Soup
I don’t want to scare you, but in addition to there being a lot of potential conflict 
of interest among financial advisors, there is also a lot of plain incompetence. 
Part of the reason: Regulations are lax. It takes little education and no real 
credentials to practice investment advising. All it took me, for example, was a 
Series 65 license in the state of Pennsylvania. I passed an exam that, if I recall, 
took less than one hour. It wasn’t too difficult, either. And I have to pay the state, 
of course, a yearly fee to maintain my license. No big deal.
Looking up investment advisor John 
Doe, AAMS, AWMA, AFC, ETC
 
You don’t need credentials to give investment advice, but investment advisors 
use more credentials than you can even count! Hundreds of credentials are 
available, and many of them — including a bunch of recent arrivals, many with 
the word “senior” or “retirement” in them — are next to worthless. They often 
require a weekend workshop and a short quiz, at most.
 
If you see credentials or letters after an advisor’s name that you don’t 
recognize, try the professional designations database at www.finra.org/
designations. That’s on the Web site of the Financial Industry Regulatory 
Authority. It gives you a thumbnail sketch of what each of the designations — 
AAMS, AWMA, AFC, C3DWP — means, and what kind of effort (or lack of effort) 
is required to get it.
Free lunch? C’mon
Landing a free lunch or dinner at a seminar 
given by an investment advisor is about as easy 
as finding dirt on a farm. Such seminars are a 
popular way for advisors to fish for new clients. 
As those of us in the profession know, however, 
the quality of the advice you get from an advisor 
is likely to be in direct inverse proportion to the 
quality of the meal. Lobster lunches equate to 
low-tide investments!
An advisor who shells out $150 per plate for a 
bunch of prospects is going to have to make 
that money up somehow. He’ll generally do it 
off the one or two suckers who go for the bait. 
Even if such an advisor puts you in index funds 
(unlikely, but possible), you’ll be paying such 
astronomical fees that you won’t possibly wind 
up ahead. More likely, your lunch or dinner 
host will put you into an investment such as 
an equity-indexed annuity, which (even though 
it has the word “index” in it) is the investment 
snake oil of the decade.

Checking for competency and criminality
Some of the more popular credentials among investment advisors include the 
CFP, which stands for Certified Financial Planner, and the CFA, which stands 
for Chartered Financial Analyst. These are both pretty strong indicators that 
an investment advisor has some good investment knowledge. But they are 
not guarantees. Nor is an MBA (such as I have), a CPA (some accountants 
know very little about investments), or any other designation a guarantee of 
competency or impartiality.
 
Regardless of the credentials being offered, check to make sure an investment 
advisor is licensed, and check to see if he or she has any record of malpractice. 
Start by going to www.finra.org and clicking on the words “BrokerCheck.” 
You’ll find sometimes revealing histories of brokers and advisors. Alternatively, 
you can call the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority at 800-289-9999.
 
If you are about to hire an advisor who isn’t licensed, you are taking a far 
greater risk than I would ever consider!
Protecting yourself from outright fraud
It’s one thing to lose money in the stock market. 
It’s another to have your nest egg ripped off by 
a squirrelly “investment advisor” who never 
intended to invest your money in anything but a 
new Hummer for himself. If you care to read about 
such blatant rip-offs, go to the Web site of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission — www.
sec.gov — and click on “Litigation Releases” 
toward the bottom of the home page. You’ll 
find hundreds of cases involving fly-by-night “
advisors” who steal money from unwitting 
clients.
To protect yourself, don’t ever sign a check or 
hand money over to anyone you don’t know 
very well. Any money you invest — in index 
funds or otherwise — should be held by a bro-
kerage house that is a member of the Securities 
Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). Unsure? 
Contact the SIPC Membership Department at 
202-371-8300, or visit it on the Web at www.
sipc.org. SIPC doesn’t protect you against 
stock market crashes, but it does protect your 
assets should a custodian go under. And for 
that reason, SIPC makes sure that its members 
have some financial muscle and that Al Capone 
isn’t running the store.
If you are giving an independent investment 
advisor permission to make trades for you, pro-
vide that advisor with limited power of attorney, 
and not full power of attorney. Limited power 
of attorney allows the advisor to make trades 
within your account on your behalf. Full power 
of attorney allows that advisor to make with-
drawals — whether on your behalf, or not.

266
Part IV: Ensuring Happy Returns 
Shopping for the Best Advisor in Town
So where exactly do you start your search for such a gem as I describe in the 
preceding paragraphs — someone who is objective and competent and not 
too greedy?
You may want to start with the National Association of Personal Financial 
Advisors (I am a member) at www.napfa.org. Most fee-only advisors belong 
to this organization. On the Web site, you can plug in your home state and 
find advisors near you.
 
Unfortunately, unless you have lots of bucks and are looking for someone to 
actually manage your money (take assets under management), you may find 
it hard to locate a fee-only advisor. Two national networks of advisors that 
specialize in working with the non-wealthy and on an hourly or set-fee fashion 
include Alliance of Cambridge Advisors (www.cambridgeadvisors.com) 
and the Garrett Planning Network (www.garrettplanningnetwork.com).
Also check out the referral service provided free at www.indexshow.com. 
Click the icon at the top of the home page that says, “Yes, I want help with 
my 401(k), IRA, or portfolio.”
You can also, of course, ask your friends and family members to recommend 
advisors. Be aware, however, that many people do a poor job of accurately 
judging the performance of their investment advisors. (They often look at last 
year’s returns and judge their advisor by that. If the market’s up, the advisor 
is good; if the market’s down, he stinks.)
Finding an index kind of guy or gal
The future is unknowable — in life, in love, and especially in financial 
markets. You’ve decided to become an index investor because you realize 
the folly of trying to time markets and pick individual stocks. Now make sure, 
if you do hire an advisor, that the advisor shares your wisdom and philosophy.
You may know everything there is to know about index investing, but if your 
advisor is a rapid trader, you may rapidly lose your savings. Poke a potential 
advisor a bit to learn about his or her investing philosophy.

267
 Chapter 17: Seeking Additional Assistance from Professionals . . . Carefully
Asking the right questions, and 
getting the right answers
Start with the following questions to determine whether an advisor is a good 
match for an index investor such as yourself.
Question #1
What kind of investment returns can I expect you to generate for me over the 
next year? Five years? Ten years?
Good answer: “Well, I don’t generate returns; the markets generate returns. 
Over the very long run, stocks have historically returned about 10 to 11 
percent a year, and bonds, about half as much. The return on your portfolio 
will depend largely on what percentage of stocks and bonds we ultimately 
choose for your portfolio. Of course, future returns may differ from past 
returns, so I’m afraid we’re a bit at the mercy of the markets.”
Bad answer: “I can guarantee you at least 30 percent a year.” (Run! Run!)
Question #2
How can you help me be less at the mercy of the markets and more in control of 
my own financial destiny?
Good answer: “I can do that by building you an optimally diversified portfolio 
with minimal costs. By so doing, I’ll see that you get maximum return with 
minimal risk. You’ll still be somewhat at the mercy of the markets, but regard-
less of what the markets do, you should still, over the long run, do better than 
the vast majority of investors, and see a positive return.”
Bad answer: “I’ll be keeping an eye on the markets for you every day. If 
things start to look ugly, I’ll quickly move all your money into cash.”
Question #3
So how exactly are you going to choose the best index funds to put me into?
Good answer: “All the index funds I use are chosen for their low costs, the 
broad and sensible indexes that they track, their tax efficiency, and their 
appropriateness to your portfolio. The total final mix will offer you a well-
diversified portfolio with exposure to all major asset classes.”
Bad answer: Anything else!

efore we finish our great indexing journey together, I 
leave you with the following three lists of ten index-
ing tidbits. I first provide you with ways to deal with the 
temptation to beat the market. Oh, yes, the temptation 
will come . . . and come again. Those who succumb to the 
temptation to beat the market often wind up getting 
beaten in the market! I then take you through ten ways to 
screw up a perfectly good index portfolio. It’s the route 
that many of the sorely tempted take — a route you will 
successfully avoid. And finally, I finish up this section with 
ten Q&As with none other than John Bogle, the Father 
of Index Investing. Hear what Bogle has to say about the 
latest twists and turns, trials and tribulations in the world 
of index investing.

Chapter 18
Ten Ways to Deal with the 
Temptation to Beat the Market
In This Chapter
▶ Realizing that you will be lured
▶ Tuning out the noise
▶ Understanding benchmarks
▶ Swallowing a dose of humility
Y
ou know that index investors wind up ahead the vast majority of the 
time. You’ve seen the numbers. You’ve read what the studies — stud-
ies prepared by hard-nosed academics in tweed jackets with leather elbow 
patches — say the odds are. You realize that you have, statistically speak-
ing, almost no chance of beating the markets, at least not after expenses and 
taxes. You are resolute to remain true to your indexing strategies and allow 
the markets to work for you, knowing that you will beat the pants off most 
investors. You are content to be the tortoise, crawling over those poor hares. 
And yet . . . and yet . . . the sirens call.
Slick magazines call out to you from airport kiosks with promises of 50 percent 
returns. For a mere $5.25, you can find out which stocks are the hottest, which 
mutual funds are certain to kick ass, and which sectors are poised for certain 
explosion. The television is worse. Jim Cramer and others scream at you, eyes 
bulging, to buy, buy, buy . . . and they tell you exactly what to buy to retire 
next month rich, rich, rich. You open your daily paper and the finance column 
similarly is telling you where to place your bets, implying strongly that you’re 
an idiot not to buy Microsoft, or Burger King, or Booger King, or whatever the 
stock du jour happens to be. Before you cash in your index funds and decide to 
get rich quick, please, please read this short chapter!

272
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Here are ten things you should do the next time temptation starts to get the 
better of you.
Turn Off the TV
Yes, it’s that simple! You don’t need what they’re selling you: not the 
get-rich-quick schemes, the junk food, or the gas-guzzling SUV. Shut out 
the noise. Cancel your subscription to Wise Money magazine. Stop reading 
the hot tips in your local paper. This will be hard to do, but it’s possible! Of 
course, your shutting out the noise won’t please the media advertisers — the 
brokerage houses and mutual fund companies — that help push so much of 
the money media drivel, but to heck with them.
Ask Yourself Who Is Doing 
the Pushing — and Why
Advertisers? Did I say advertisers? If you do pick up that magazine that, on 
pages 37 through 40, reveals the “Hot Funds for the New Year!,” you should 
notice which fund companies are advertising on pages 48, 52, and the back 
cover. What a coincidence! Notice, too, how many other suckers are buying 
that same magazine in hopes of getting rich. If the truth were printed on the 
cover — “Indexing (Yawn) Is Still the Best Strategy” — how many people 
would reach into the kiosk to buy that magazine? Precious few. Indexing 
stories don’t sell magazines. “Hot Funds!” stories sell magazines. “Become a 
Millionaire Tomorrow!” stories sell magazines.
Google the Past
A number of columnists and talking heads on TV make their living telling 
readers what to buy and what to sell, and they do it with such conviction. Oh 
yes, they have their reasons that you should buy Amalgamated Electronics 
and sell Acme Chili-and-Pudding Products this week. (It all has to do with 
consumer demand, interest rates, and China, you see.) Before you even think 
of taking any advice you read in the paper or see on TV, do an online search 
for the stock pickers’ suggestions this time last year. You’ll probably get as 
much indigestion as if you ate a bowl of Acme chili-and-pudding.

273
 Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Deal with the Temptation to Beat the Market
Remember the Rule of Appropriate 
Benchmarks
If a market prognosticator or a mutual fund manager claims to have a great track 
record and bases his success on “beating the S&P 500,” that should raise your 
eyebrow right away. Remember that the S&P 500 represents 500 of America’s 
largest corporations. Large companies tend to lag small companies when the 
markets are hot. So after a few months of stock market rise, many stock pickers, 
who generally pick the stocks of smaller, lesser-known companies, will seem 
successful. But just wait till the market goes down (as markets always do)! 
Beating the S&P 500 in the short-term is no big deal. Find out how this great 
prognosticator has done in the long run. If there is no long-run record, at 
the very least find out how this person’s picks have done against appropriate 
benchmarks, which will often not be the S&P 500, but indexes that track 
either small value stocks or small growth stocks.
Understand the Ratings Claims
Ads for actively run mutual funds and mutual fund companies are rife with 
subtle misrepresentations that may give you the impression that indexing 
is for suckers. You should be aware of these subtle misrepresentations. 
Keep an eye open for them. Here’s misrepresentation #1: “Eight out of ten of 
our funds achieved Morningstar/Lipper ratings of [insert impressive rating 
figures here].” Many mutual fund companies, especially the smaller ones, 
specialize in a certain kind of investment, such as bonds, foreign stocks, 
or real estate. If that particular kind of investment (asset class) happens to 
have done well in the past months, it can make a mutual fund company look 
genius. Don’t buy it. Studies show that the single largest determinant of how 
well a particular investment does (up to 95 percent of how well that invest-
ment does) relates to the type of investment group (asset class) it belongs to.
Watch Out for Expiration Dates
Here’s subtle misrepresentation #2: You pick up a magazine in September, and a 
particular mutual fund is showing you how well it did one year, three years, and 
five years prior to December of the previous year. Advertisers often hand-pick 
their starting and ending dates to make their returns appear as high as possible. 
If you see an ending date that looks suspiciously old, check to see how the fund 
has performed in the past few months. You may be in for a surprise.

274
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Recognize Random Success
You may see an advertisement informing you that such-as-such fund beat 
such-and-such index over the past three years, five years, or whatever. Even if 
the index is an appropriate benchmark, such claims are still no guarantee that 
the fund’s manager has any stock-picking abilities whatever. Keep in mind that 
there are thousands of such managers out there. Suppose they were flipping 
coins and trying to get all heads instead of trying to beat the indexes by picking 
stocks. Randomness tells us that of 6,000 managers flipping coins, 3,000 will 
get heads on the first flip. If they do the exercise again, 1,500 can be expected 
to get heads twice in a row. The third time, 750 will get heads. After five tosses, 
187 of the managers will still have a perfect head-tossing record. Studies show 
that active managers with great track records tend to be far fewer than you 
would expect from randomness alone! Studies also show that star performers 
in any given year rarely exhibit such star performance the following year.
Pull Out Your Calculator
You wouldn’t buy a car or a washing machine without wanting to know the 
full price, would you? Before plunking, say, $10,000 into a mutual fund that 
charges 1.5 percent a year in management expenses, punch out the numbers 
on your calculator: $10,000 × .15 = $150. Over the next ten years, you’ll pay 
this manager ($150 x 10) $1,500 in the hopes he can beat the market for you. 
Keep in mind that it isn’t really $1,500; it’s much, much more. Every year, 
that money you pay the manager is denied the opportunity to grow for you. 
And that denied growth is compounded year in and year out. John Bogle (see 
Chapter 20) refers to the “tyranny of compounding costs.” He reckons that 
over ten years, investing in the average actively managed mutual fund costs 
you about 21 percent of your possible gains. If you look at the real-world 
performance figures of actively managed funds verses index funds (provided 
on the cheat sheet at the front of this book), you’ll see that Bogle’s numbers 
are right on the mark.
Recognize That Someone, Somewhere 
Is Betting Against You
Most shares of stocks and most bonds — the vast majority in both cases — 
are bought and sold by professionals, men and women with fancy suits, lots 
of degrees, and incredible resources at their fingertips. Keep that in mind 
when your brother-in-law tells you to buy XYZ Corp. stock because he works 
with a gal whose husband once worked for XYZ, who says blah-blah-blah and 
$30 per share is a steal. When you go to buy your shares at $30, someone — 

275
 Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Deal with the Temptation to Beat the Market
very likely one of those professionals in a fancy suit — will be selling those 
shares for $30. Why is that? If this stock “must go up,” as your brother-in-law 
is telling you, why is there some professional out there betting otherwise? 
And what makes you think that your brother-in-law knows more than this 
professional, who probably tracks this stock full time and has a bevy of 
researchers?
Review the Facts
Remember that by index investing, you are not going to beat the market, but 
you are going to beat the performance of the vast majority of other investors. 
I hope I make that clear in the early chapters of this book. If you doubt me, 
flip through Part I. If that doesn’t work, try a few other reads, including the 
seminal A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton G. Malkiel (W.W. Norton 
& Company) or John Bogle’s The Little Book of Common Sense Investing 
(Wiley). Or flip to Appendix C of this book for suggestions as to many other 
sources for information on index investing. After all, the message that you 
can beat the markets is coming to you from many sources — you may need a 
few good tools to resist the temptation. But you can do it!

I
ndex investing doesn’t require any kind of Herculean intellectual effort, 
but it does require some smarts. If you’ve read this book, you can do it — 
and you can do it very well! All you need at this point is not to fall prey to any 
of the ten foibles I describe in this chapter.
Chase Hot Sectors
As I’m writing this, people are lining up to buy commodities and emerging-
market stocks, and they are turning largely to (highly advertised) exchange-
traded funds (ETFs). When commodities and emerging markets cool, these 
same investors will sell, and then they’ll look for whatever ETFs are hot at 
that time and buy those. Over the long run, these poor, confused investors will 
be buying high (as sectors heat up) and selling low (as they cool). Numerous 
studies show that individual investors tend to see much lower returns than 
the markets, or even the average funds. That’s because they’re chasing hot 
sectors. Don’t!

278
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Take Inappropriate Risks
Index funds remove some of the risk of investing, but there’s still plenty 
left behind, especially when investing in stock index funds. Only the rare 
individual should have a portfolio of more than 80 percent stocks — even 
if those funds represent a highly diverse collection of stock indexes. Most 
people should have at least 30 percent non-stocks in a portfolio (bonds and 
cash, mostly). Yes, in the long run stocks will probably return more than 
those other asset classes — but don’t get greedy! Regardless of your age, 
your income, or whatever else, you need diversification.
Invest in Nonsense
Some indexes and index funds just make limited sense. And some indexes 
and index funds, well, even to say “limited sense” would be a compliment! 
Some of the ETFs based on newfangled “fundamental indexes” seem 
promising, but exercise caution with anything that hasn’t been road-tested. 
The index funds that truly scare me, however, are the leveraged indexes 
that promise you double the returns of the market, and the inverse indexes 
that promise you returns opposite the market. Some funds even offer double 
the inverse of the market. Forget about them. The leveraged funds and the 
inverse funds have been around for years and have left behind too many 
burnt investors to count. Steer clear, too, of index funds that track tiny 
markets (individual countries with populations smaller than Montana’s) or 
thin slivers of markets (such as drug companies working on cancer cures).
Pay Too Much to the Fund Company
Part of the rationale for index investing is that it saves you money — or it 
should. Most index mutual funds and ETFs charge operating expenses of 
fractions of 1 percent; I list some of the more economical options throughout 
this book. Fill your portfolio with index mutual funds and ETFs from Vanguard, 
Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, Barclays, and State Street. Do not pay some of the 
ridiculous fees (in some cases 2 percent or more — and sometimes with an 
odious load on top of that) from the more expensive, what-the-market-will-bear 
companies like ProFunds, Rydex, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and State Farm. 
This is one case where you most certainly will not get what you pay for . . . 
you’ll be getting considerably less!

279
 Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Screw Up a Perfectly Good Index Portfolio
Fail to Change with the Times
Buying and holding, right along with indexing (they compliment each other 
so well!), is overall the best investment strategy. But don’t take that to the 
extreme. The “perfect” portfolio for you today may not be right tomorrow. 
In particular, as we move on in years and presumably get closer to reaching 
our nest egg goals, it makes eminent sense to throttle down on the risk. After 
all, after you reach your financial goal, you’ll find yourself with more to lose 
than to gain. Buy and hold, yes, but don’t allow your portfolio to rust. Give it 
a good going-over every 18 months, at a minimum. (Rebalance at that point, 
as I discuss in Chapter 16.) Review your holdings, as well, anytime there 
has been a major life change (marriage, divorce, new career, your kid gets 
accepted into Princeton).
Put the Wrong Funds in 
the Wrong Accounts
Some index funds are much more tax-friendly than others. Put your stock 
index funds, which pay you mostly in appreciated share price and qualified 
dividends, into your taxable account. Stick your bond index funds, and your 
REIT funds, which pay you mostly through nonqualified dividends or interest 
payments, into your tax-advantaged accounts, such as your IRA or 401(k). 
Such proper placement can make a huge difference at tax time. If you have 
both U.S. and foreign index funds, the foreign index funds should be in your 
taxable account — not in a retirement account. That’s because you get credit 
at year-end for any taxes paid to foreign governments, but only if the foreign-
stock fund is held in your taxable account. If you keep those funds in your 
retirement account, you get no credit.
Allow Yourself to Get Eaten 
Alive by Little Charges
Even if you have your ETFs and index mutual funds in the most discounted 
of discount brokerages, those $5 or $10 charges can add up. ETFs are the 
more likely culprits to cost you more than you think over time. Regular, small 
deposits and withdrawals should not be made using ETFs. Most index mutual 
funds cost nothing to buy and sell, but there may be charges if you move 
money too often. Be sure to check with your brokerage house.

280
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Get Scared and Head for the Hills
It’s easy to say, “I’m an aggressive investor,” but are you really? Could you 
stomach a 50 percent decline in the markets? A lot of people thought they 
were aggressive investors during the great bull market of the 1990s. But when 
the growly bear came out to snag them in 2000–2002, many of those investors 
suddenly lost their nerve and pulled their money from the markets faster than 
you could say dot-com. Of course, they then locked in their losses and were not 
present when the market popped back up in the few subsequent years. More 
recently, many investors dumped their financial stocks just as soon as the going 
got tough. My guess is that the financial market will pop back, and these people 
will have missed the boat. Be honest with yourself. If you are going to pull out of 
the market when the going gets rough, you really shouldn’t be there now.
Pay Too Much for Investment Advice
Reading this book probably qualifies you as a do-it-yourselfer when it comes 
to your finances. But you may feel more comfortable seeking the advice of an 
expert. That’s fine. A good investment counselor (such as, ahem, yours truly) 
will work with you on an hourly basis to set up your portfolio, determine reason-
able goals, and set you on your way. Others may want to take your assets under 
management and put themselves on retainer. Some financial people will be 
happy to look at your portfolio alone; others will want to do a complete financial 
plan, examining not only your investments but also your insurance, your estate 
plans, and your will. What’s a reasonable amount to pay for financial advice? If 
you’re looking for primarily investment advice, I would draw the line at about 1 
percent of your portfolio for the initial setup. If you’re looking at ongoing man-
agement of your index portfolio, I would draw the line at about half a percent a 
year. I strongly urge you to hire a fee-only advisor (that means the advisor takes 
no commissions from third parties) and to run — don’t walk, run — from any 
advisor who suggests you buy any index funds that involve paying a load.
Obsess
A big part of the appeal of index funds, to me, is that they allow you to relax. 
You don’t have to worry about any manager absconding with your money, 
taking dumb bets, or moving your funds to someplace entirely inappropriate. 
In the long run, you know what your return will be: roughly that of the entire 
market. There’s no point in checking your account balance every day, or 
even every week. Your money should be working for you . . . you should not 
be working for your money. So kick back and enjoy life. Golf! Take a bike ride! 
Go to the beach! Don’t allow a basically automatic plan to consume your time 
and energy. Obsessing about your portfolio, even if your portfolio does well, 
is the ultimate investor screw-up!

Chapter 20
Ten Q & As with John Bogle, 
Father of Index Investing
In This Chapter
▶ Reflecting on the past and present of the business of indexing
▶ Commenting on newfangled index methodologies
▶ Considering what the future of indexing may bring
▶ Offering advice on investing success
I
n 1974, John (“Jack”) Bogle founded The Vanguard Group, and in 1975, 
he introduced the very first index mutual fund available to the public. 
For 22 years, he served as chairman and chief executive officer of Vanguard, 
introducing other index funds and shaking up the financial industry as no one 
has done before or since.
Today, Bogle is the president of Vanguard’s Bogle Financial Markets Research 
Center, as well as a prolific author. He’s written six books in all, most recently 
The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism (Yale University Press) and The Little Book 
of Common Sense Investing (Wiley). He is a frequent commentator on how the 
little guy (and big guys, too) should invest for success. TIME magazine named 
him one of the world’s 100 most powerful and influential people. Some serious 
proponents of index investing refer to themselves as “Bogleheads.”
Jack Bogle is the undisputed Father of Index Investing, and I am very pleased 
that he made the time to join me for an informative and provocative Q&A 
session on that very subject.
Q. It’s now been more than three decades since you introduced the first 
index fund. Is there anything you know now about index investing that 
you wish you had known from the get-go?

282
Part V: The Part of Tens 
A. There’s really nothing major, no. Our very first fund — The First Index 
Investment Trust; it has since been renamed the Vanguard 500 Index fund 
and trades under the ticker VFINX — has tracked the market with great 
precision and has outperformed 80 to 85 percent of all active funds. That’s 
what we figured would happen from the onset, and that’s exactly what did 
happen . . . so the proof is in the pudding. I suppose if there is one thing that 
we could have done better, it was in the introduction of small cap indexing. 
We initially didn’t realize how much turnover there would be as companies 
graduated to larger size, or failed, or merged with other companies. That 
made the first small cap index funds less tax efficient than we anticipated. 
But we’ve since made correction for that with much better indexes.
Q. What are some of the more positive developments in index investing that 
you’ve seen in recent days? And are there any index investing (or alleged 
index investing) abominations you’ve noted and care to comment on?
A. I’m pleased with the development of the total-market index fund. I’m quite 
displeased with the number of funds tracking narrow slices of the market. 
The real problems with index investing began with the advent of exchange-
traded funds (ETFs). There are now approximately 700 of them, and only 15 
of them are broad-market index funds. The rest tend to track narrow markets, 
such as industry sectors — technology, healthcare, energy, and such, and 
specific countries. I’m also not too happy with the number of so-called index 
funds that seek to beat the market with fundamental indexing, whether that 
means zeroing in on dividend payouts, company revenues, earnings, or 
whatever. A true index must be cap-weighted, with each company represented 
in proportion to its market value.
Another abomination is the introduction of all those ETFs that are leveraged 
and inverse. . . . The only way such funds will ever work for you is if you’re 
one of those people (if they exist at all) who know in advance what the 
market is going to do each day.
Finally, although broad-market index ETFs can be wonderful buy-and-hold 
investments, they are being used too often as vehicles for speculation — 
bought today and sold tomorrow. That’s not what indexing is all about. 
That’s speculation. And it involves high costs and often considerable taxation. 
It’s great for the brokerages and the creators of these funds, and maybe 
Uncle Sam, but it isn’t so great for investors.
Q. What would you say is the number one misunderstanding that many 
people have about index investing?

283
 Chapter 20: Ten Q & As with John Bogle, Father of Index Investing
A. It’s almost too bad that we use the words index investing, because that 
in itself leads to misunderstanding. We should perhaps call it all-market 
investing. That would make it clear that the very best investment strategy 
is to capture the returns, not of narrow market sectors, but of the entire 
business world at a minimal cost. The way to do that is to invest in the 
entire market — U.S. and foreign — through low-cost, broad-market funds. 
Everything else is essentially speculation. Another common misconception 
is that indexing is safe. Broad-market investing does eliminate certain risks, 
that is true — the risks in individual stocks, of picking market sectors, and 
of actively managed funds. But there is still market risk, and that can be 
significant in and of itself.
Q. Despite the success of index investing — despite the triumph of index 
investing over the past decades — the vast majority of people still believe 
in active investing. Why the heck is that? And does it frustrate you?
A. Yes, that’s true — broad-market index funds account for only about 12 
percent of all money invested in the stock market. And, yes, that frustrates 
me! The number one reason why so many people still rely on active investing: 
The investment industry has done a great job, and continues to do a great 
job, of marketing. The fund marketers always have more information than 
the public, and they can always produce a few funds that have done better 
than the index, and then advertise the heck out of them. They sell their active 
funds, while index funds have to sell themselves.
The second reason: Index investing is counterintuitive, and at first blush, it 
seems un-American. Most people in this country believe that you get what 
you pay for, and it’s hard for them to believe that the cheapest funds are 
really the best funds. It’s similarly hard to believe that the best management 
of all is no management. And finally, people have way too high an opinion of 
their own investment prowess. . . . We all believe that we’re smarter than our 
peers . . . we think we can do better. Of course, on average, we’re all average!
Q. What’s your prediction for the future of index investing over, say, the 
next 30 years?
A. My prediction is that true broad-market investing will be far larger than 
now. At present, it’s about 12 percent of the entire stock market; I would 
think that we’ll see that number at least double in the next 30 years. All that 
that requires is that investors get it — that they understand that costs are 
all-important, and that the promises of the “market beaters,” as alluring as 
they are, are false promises.

284
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Q. You mentioned fundamental indexing earlier. Some index fund 
providers today are using some rather radical methodologies for creating 
indexes, and these newfangled indexes have been catching on fast with 
many investors. You maintain, however, that the more traditional 
cap-weighted indexes are best. Why?
A. Oh, whenever anyone says that they’ve come up with a new system that will 
beat the market and work regardless of market conditions, I put a hand over 
my wallet! Many of the newer ETFs are tracking fundamental indexes that have 
beaten the traditional indexes in the past — but the ETFs were not created in 
the past. They were created only after the indexes they are tracking had done 
well. Their superlative track records exist only on paper, in a theoretical world. 
As time moves on, I’m quite certain that the outperformance we’ve seen from 
such back testing won’t continue. In fact, just in the past year, we’ve seen many 
of those fundamentally weighted funds underperform the traditional indexes 
by a wide margin. That wasn’t supposed to happen!
Q. Many of the index products today, particularly ETFs, are tracking things 
other than stocks and bonds, such as commodities and currencies. Do 
these asset classes belong in an average person’s portfolio at all?
A. Stocks and bonds are productive assets. They are investments that earn 
an internal rate of return. Bonds pay interest. Stocks produce earnings 
growth and usually pay dividends, reflecting the return on capital invested by 
the companies that issue the stocks. Currencies and commodities are pure 
speculations that have no internal rate of return . . . they are not productive 
assets. They may produce short-term returns in certain economic environments, 
but over the long run, I wouldn’t expect that to be the case. As such, they 
should play no significant role in the portfolio of a long-term serious investor.
Q. Some of the index fund providers today are charging operating 
expenses considerably higher than, say, Vanguard ever has. In fact, some 
are charging more than even active funds! Is there a limit to what one 
should ever pay for an index product? What should that limit be?
A. I would draw the line at 0.20 percent in yearly operating expenses for a 
broad-market index fund. There’s not much reason to pay more than that, 
and some broad-market index funds charge a lot more. A firm like Morgan 
Stanley, for example, charges what the traffic will bear, getting away with 
murder, and their investors are losing greatly in the process. [Author’s note: 
The Morgan Stanley S&P 500 Index fund, A class (SPIAX), charges a front load 
(commission) of 5.25 percent, a net expense ratio of 0.64 percent, and a 12b-1 
fee (ongoing marketing fee) of 0.24 percent.] It’s absurd. The whole success 
of indexing depends on low cost. And there’s no reason to charge a lot of 
money for an index fund, as the fund requires no management. In the case of 
international developed-world funds, I’d draw the line at 0.30 percent. And in 

285
 Chapter 20: Ten Q & As with John Bogle, Father of Index Investing
the case of emerging markets, I wouldn’t pay more than 0.40 percent. That’s 
not to say that costs should be your only consideration in choosing an index 
fund — you also want a fund issued by a solid company with good people at 
the helm — but costs should always be paramount.
Q. Let’s talk for a minute about the Big Picture. Ultimately, the returns on 
stock indexes are tied to the success of businesses operating within our 
capitalistic system. How is our economic system doing? You expressed 
some serious concerns in The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism. Do 
indexed portfolios of stocks and bonds still make sense, given some of the 
problems we’re seeing today?
A. I feel that capitalism, for all its problems, is still strong. And our 
economy is very resilient. We’re gotten through recessions, depressions, 
and war. And we’ll get through the challenges we’re seeing today. I have 
enormous confidence in our youngest generation. The returns on capital and 
the performance of the markets, in the long run, should continue to be fairly 
similar to what they’ve been in the past. But with the dividend yield on stocks 
today less than half of the long-term norm (2.3 percent versus about 5 percent), 
future returns on stocks will likely be lower than history might suggest.
But I see changes, and not all good ones, including greater global 
competition and a higher failure rate of companies, that forewarn of more 
turbulent markets. That turbulence will make it more important to index than 
ever. More than ever, you want to own a piece of all companies. By keeping 
your costs low and resisting the urge to speculate, you’ll let the system work 
for you in the long run — and I don’t think the system will let you down.
Q. Thank you very much for your time, Jack. And thank you for all that 
you’ve done for the common investor. I have only one last question: 
What’s it like to be a living legend?
A. I travel much of the time, and I meet with a lot of people. I get many 
positive comments, and it makes me feel very good to know that I’ve helped 
people meet their financial goals. But a legend? Someday, perhaps, I’ll get to 
that point where I feel like a legend, soak that up, and really enjoy it. But for 
right now, I’m simply too busy trying to get my message out there to take 
much time to reflect. As Sophocles said, “One must wait until the evening to 
see how splendid the day has been.” I may be 79, but I don’t see this as the 
evening of my life . . . not yet. It’s still day.

elcome to the end of Index Investing For Dummies. 
In this part, I give you some very useful reference 
material, including a handy list of  index mutual funds 
(courtesy of Morningstar) and a similarly handy list of 
index exchange-traded funds (courtesy of ETFguide.com). 
Both lists, but particularly the list of ETFs, can be 
expected to change over time, which is exactly why I also 
provide you with a list of Web resources that you can use 
to keep as up-to-date as possible on any developments in 
index investing.

Appendix A
A Select List of Index 
Mutual Funds
M
orningstar graciously provided me with a complete list of index 
mutual funds for this book. For space purposes, and also to eliminate 
index funds that I’d rather you don’t invest in anyway, I’ve removed the 
following types of funds from the comprehensive list:
 
✓ Funds with expense ratios greater than 0.70 percent
 
✓ Funds that require ridiculously high minimums and are used primarily 
by institutions
 
✓ Very small index funds from small companies that may be difficult to 
purchase and probably aren’t worth the effort anyway
 
✓ Funds with odious loads (commissions paid to brokers)
In the end, what you see here is a list of what I consider to be acceptable 
index mutual funds available to individual investors. My faves are outlined 
throughout the book.

A Select List of Exchange-
Traded Funds
T
o create this list, I started with a complete list of exchange-traded funds, 
provided to me by the kind courtesy of the folks at www.etfguide.com. 
Because that list is long and forever growing, and because not everything on 
it is worthy of your consideration, I’ve pared it down a bit.
The list that follows is a great starting point to do your ETF shopping. The 
following categories of ETFs have been eliminated:
 
✓ ETFs with expense ratios of greater than 0.70 percent
 
✓ Leveraged and inverse ETFs
 
✓ Currency ETFs
 
✓ ETFs that track extremely narrow indexes
 
✓ Single-country indexes, except for Japan and the U.K. (the second- and 
third-largest stock markets in the world)
 
✓ Commodity ETFs, except for a few select funds that may make sense 
in certain portfolios. Important note: This category includes exchange-
traded notes, which are not exactly ETFs. Read Chapter 9 before you 
invest. A few of these have expense ratios as high as 0.75 percent.
What’s left behind are by and large the building blocks — along with perhaps 
index mutual funds (see Appendix A) — that you want to use to create your 
index portfolio.

Helpful Web Resources for the 
Smart Index Investor
T
imes change, indexes change, index products (sometimes for better, 
sometimes for worse) continue to proliferate. Make sure you stay up to 
speed by popping in now and then to some of these Web sites.
Web Sites with an Index Investing Focus
www.bogleheads.org: Not only the official fan club of John Bogle, father 
of index investing, but also a place to engage in intelligent conversation with 
some ardent fans of index investing, as well as a few very knowledgeable 
investors and advisors.
www.efficientfrontier.com: The Web site of finance guru William 
Bernstein. Bernstein presents a scientific look at index investing, with some 
rather weighty discussions. Lots of good food for thought.
www.etfconnect.com: Quotes, yields, and ETF nuts-n-bolts information 
(expense ratios, performance records, and so on). A search function allows 
you to rummage through the world of ETFs to find one that fits your specific 
needs. The sponsor is Nuveen Investments, a provider of closed-end mutual 
funds. Purposely, there is a blurring of the lines between closed-end mutual 
funds and ETFs. They are not the same!
www.etfguide.com: A good, quick summary of the entire ETF world — 
what’s hot, what’s not, and why. It contains a complete listing of all ETFs 
available, along with ticker symbols. 
www.etftrends.com: A gossip column of sorts for ETF enthusiasts. There’s 
chit-chat about new ETFs on the market, ETFs pending approval of the SEC, 
behind-the-scenes industry workings, rumors, and ripoffs.
www.etfzone.com: Discussion, data, news, and more . . . practically 
everything you want to know about ETFs, and then some.

316
Part VI: Appendixes 
http://finance.yahoo.com/etf: Features a search function with 
intimate details on individual funds, an ETF glossary, and regularly updated 
news and commentary.
http://finance.yahoo.com/funds: Focuses on mutual funds, with all 
sorts of helpful shopping tools.
www.indexfunds.com: A commercial Web site from a guy, Mark Hebner, 
who wants to manage your money (in index funds, of course). But he is also 
an index-investing evangelist and packs his Web site with scads of information, 
both old and new, on the virtues of indexing.
www.indexshow.com: Would you believe that there’s a syndicated radio 
show about index investing? Check out the stations, the schedule, and the 
topics by logging on here.
www.indexuniverse.com: See “Breaking News” for the most up-to-date 
information on ETFs and index mutual funds. The commentary section 
features some of the most intelligent discussion of indexing you’ll encounter 
anywhere.
www.morningstar.com: (Click either the ETF icon or the Funds icon on the 
blue bar at the top of screen.) Thorough information on individual funds, 
along with Morningstar’s trademarked rating system. (One star is bad, five 
stars is grand.)
www.seekingalpha.com: Tons of information, some good, some bad. I 
like the ETF selector, which divides up the ever-growing world of ETFs into 
manageable chunks.
General Investing News, Advice, 
and Education
www.bankrate.com: Compare rates on all sorts of fixed-income invest-
ments. Get the latest lowdown on CD rates, mortgages, and home-equity 
loans.
www.bloomberg.com: Rather hardcore financial data, news of Corporate 
America, and sporadic dirt on CEOs being sued by their ex-wives.
www.cnnfn.com: Get your daily dose of everything markets-related, includ-
ing pre-market trading quotes, currency exchange rates, and bond yields.
www.dinkytown.com: Financial calculators of every sort imaginable.

317
 Appendix C: Helpful Web Resources for the Smart Index Investor
http://finance.yahoo.com: Surf your heart out . . . tons of information 
on financial markets. There’s also a section that allows you input data on 
your own portfolio and track its performance.
www.finra.org/fundanalyzer: Compare the expenses of up to three 
ETFs, mutual funds, or share classes of the same mutual fund.
www.marketwatch.com: An encyclopedia of investment information, 
updated daily. Links to blogs and podcasts allow you spend hours and hours 
reading or listening to news about the markets, if you care to.
www.moneychimp.com: For the beginning to the more advanced investor, 
this site with a silly name offers quick and mostly accurate hits on a number 
of important investment subjects.
www.morningstar.com: Exclusive ratings of funds, and much more. 
Morningstar offers many premium services. If you’re going to subscribe to 
any, you may, as a serious index investor, consider the ETFInvestor newsletter 
($150/year).
www.riskgrades.com: A novel way of looking at investment risk and return, 
much simpler than standard deviation.
www.socialinvest.org: A wealth of information on socially responsible 
investing.
Financial Supermarkets
Otherwise known as large brokerage houses, here are some places where you 
can buy, sell, and house your index funds.
www.fidelity.com: Or telephone Fidelity at 800-544-8888.
www.schwab.com: Or telephone Charles Schwab at 866-232-9890.
www.amtd.com: Or telephone TD Ameritrade at 800-454-9272.

www.zecco.com: Or telephone Zecco at 877-700-7862.

Index Fund Providers: Exchange-Traded 
Funds
Here are the big players in ETFs (which also happen to be those I tend to 
most often recommend):
 
✓ Barclays Global Investors iShares: www.ishares.com
 
✓ State Street Global Advisors (SSgA): www.ssgafunds.com
 
✓ Vanguard ETFs: www.vanguard.com/etf
And here are the smaller players:
 
✓ Claymore Securities: www.claymore.com
 
✓ Currency Shares: www.currencyshares.com
 
✓ Deutsche Bank: www.dbcfund.db.com
 
✓ First Trust: www.ftportfolios.com
 
✓ Invesco PowerShares: www.invescopowershares.com

entire portfolio:

✓ www.tiaacref.com
 
✓ www.troweprice.com
 
✓ www.vanguard.com

 Appendix C: Helpful Web Resources for the Smart Index Investor
Stock Exchanges
This is where the action happens if you happen to be investing in ETFs rather 
than index mutual funds.
www.amex.com: Almost half of all ETFs are listed on the American Stock 
Exchange. Bland Web site, but it provides all the ETF basics.
www.nyse.com: Those ETFS that aren’t listed on the AMEX are by and large 
traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Surprisingly, there isn’t a lot of ETF 
information on the Web site, but there is a wealth of general information 
about the world of finance.
www.nasdaq.com: Despite the fact that not many ETFs are listed on the 
NASDAQ, there are some very cool things on this Web site. Check out 
especially the “ETF Dynamic Heatmap.”
The People Who Create the Indexes
In case you want to get to the nuts and bolts of it all . . .
 
✓ www.djindexes.com
 
✓ www.ftse.com
 
✓ www.lehman.com
 
✓ www.mscibarra.com
 
✓ www.russell.com
 
✓ www.standardandpoors.com
 
✓ www.wilshire.com
Best Retirement Calculators
www.firecalc.com: FIRE is short for Financial Independence/Retire Early, 
and this free Web site (feel free to contribute!) is one of the best you’ll find. 
There’s lots more here than a calculator, including some pretty good general 
investment advice, and even a forum where you can chat with others about 
retiring young, if that’s your thing.

320
Part VI: Appendixes 
www.moneychimp.com/articles/volatility/retirement.htm: 
Moneychimp is a funny name, but it’s a great Web site full of all kinds of 
financial calculators. For some funny reason, there’s a ridiculously simple 
and simpleminded retirement calculator featured on the home page. The 
better calculator is buried deeper within. Make sure you use the link 
provided here.
www3.troweprice.com/ric/RIC/: Many of the financial supermarkets offer 
silly retirement calculators; T. Rowe Price’s uses Monte Carlo simulations and 
is presented in an easy-to-read fashion. (RIC stands for Retirement Income 
Calculator.)
Where to Find a Financial Planner
www.cfp.net: The Certified Financial Planning Board of Standards, which 
lists Certified Financial Planners (CFPs) nationwide. The CFP designation 
assures that the person has a fair amount of education and experience, and 
passed a wicked ten-hour exam.
www.cfainstitute.org: CFA Institute is where you want to go to find a 
Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), which is not as well known but is very 
similar to a CFP.
www.fpanet.org: Financial Planning Association is the nation’s largest 
organization of financial planners. It doesn’t take much to join.
www.napfa.org: National Association of Personal Financial Advisors is the 
association for fee-onlys: financial people who don’t take commissions but 
rather work for a straight fee. About four out of ten financial planners are 
fee-onlys.
www.cambridgeadvisors.com: A national network of fee-onlys who are 
eager to work with middle-class folk.
www.garrettplanningnetwork.com: A list of 250 or so financial advisors 
who charge for services on an hourly, as-needed basis.
