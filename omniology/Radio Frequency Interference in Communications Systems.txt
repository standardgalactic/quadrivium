Preface
Radio frequency interference (RFI) is the kind of technical topic that creates anxi­
ety in those who use radio waves for telecommunications. We refer to this mode as 
radiocommunication, a contraction adopted by the International Telecommunica­
tion Union (ITU) and which identifies our domain of interest. But, RFI is a unique 
form of disruption to radiocommunication in that it enters through the receiving 
antenna as do desired signals. Radio waves know no boundaries because of their 
unguided nature and ability to cross geographic and political boundaries. For this 
reason, the ITU long ago established radiocommunication as one of its primary 
areas of activity, conducted through ITU-R, where the R stands for radio.
This book is about the practice of identifying, resolving, and managing RFI 
across the broad range of radiocommunication systems and applications. This is a 
technical field which, like medicine, demonstrates how a science of maladies has a 
direct impact on daily life. Radio developed over the years from the two most basic 
modes of one-way broadcasting and two-way point-to-point communication, to 
the point now that literally all forms of communication, including the Internet, rely 
on it to reach the end user. In the latter case, the popular terms are “cellular” and 
“wireless,” which seem to distinguish these uses from the classic term “radio.” But 
those of us who work in and across these domains know full well that RFI is still a 
common denominator of concern and even trouble. RFI has become a high-stakes 
game where entire business plans and mission strategies can succeed or fail if RFI 
is not resolved. 
We have evolved from a time when static and background noise were the main 
cause of reception problems and connection failures; now, RFI is often the de­
terminant of performance and, importantly, system capacity. Achieving the right 
capacity becomes a financial issue in terms of revenue to a commercial wireless en­
terprise. We all recognize that the radio spectrum is a limited resource and must be 
reused many times over across geography and direction. This book is dedicated to 
proper consideration of RFI, wherein we can maintain the reliability and promote 
greater use of radiocommunication going forward.
To understand RFI one needs to understand the principle of radio: modern 
transmitters and receivers employing digital modulation and coding, directional 
antennas to achieve coverage and reduce RFI in the environment, the ways that 
radio waves propagate in space and across the landscape, and the mechanisms that 
can produce RFI in the first place. From that, we address how it can be character­
ized and resolved into a workable problem with practical solutions. Many readers

Preface
will come into the topic of RFI with a solid background in radio engineering or 
practice. Others with less experience will still understand the importance of RFI 
and need for its resolution, but want some of the background that supports the 
necessary study and design (the “secret handshake” of radiocommunication art). 
For that reason, we provide sufficient description of radiocommunication so that 
all readers will be able to follow our exposition and apply its recommendations.
To that end, this book is organized into three broad topics: I) the requirements 
for and engineering of radiocommunication systems and technology, II) radio wave 
propagation, defining the direct and indirect paths on the Earth and between Earth 
and space taken by the desired signal and the undesired RFI, and III) the details 
of RFI analysis (particularly C/I assessment) and resolution strategies involving 
investigation and mitigation of problems before, during and after RFI is identified 
or experienced. 
Part I includes Chapters 1, 2, and 3 and is a review of radiocommunication in 
the context of the RFI question. There is enough technical material here to be a 
basis for subsequent examination of RFI. Expert readers can scan this material and 
then move on to the core topics in the remainder of the book. Chapter 1 points out 
where the consideration of RFI fits within the overall field of electromagnetic com­
patibility (EMC) and why RFI problems require effective study and brainstorming. 
The coverage of radiocommunication system design in Chapter 2 is at a fairly basic 
level but is technically accurate. This is a good jumping off place for further study 
using the World Wide Web or other resources referenced with the chapter. Chapter 
3 delves specifically into the sources of electromagnetic disruption to radiocom­
munication and provides a good review of such key topics as intentional and unin­
tentional interference; intermodulation and spurious signal generation; interference 
from pulse sources (e.g., radar); and the key topic of C/I, also called protection 
ratio (addressed in greater detail in Chapter 6). These are considered throughout 
part I) for land-based (terrestrial) systems as well as space-based repeaters and 
signal sources.
Part II provides Chapters 4 and 5 to identify the various propagation modes 
that radiocommunication signals and RFI take between transmitting emitter (an­
tenna or otherwise) and receiving antenna. This is a complex topic and depen­
dent on propagation data collected and analyzed over past decades and through 
experience with radio systems. These extend from 100 kHz on the low end up to 
100 GHz at the top of current millimeter wave development. Chapter 5 will be 
familiar to many who have involvement with radio since it covers propagation in 
free space. While this type of path may be unobstructed, there are key phenom­
ena in the earth’s atmosphere that both reduce (attenuate) signals and can allow 
RFI to propagate well beyond the horizon (rain scatter and ducting, for example). 
Obstructed paths are covered in Chapter 6 to address signals that may be blocked 
but nevertheless reach the receiver through a variety of means. The methods of 
knife-edge diffraction (Gourdet/Fresnel) and smooth earth diffraction (Bullington) 
are reviewed with examples provided. When mobility is introduced, the individual 
desired and RFI signals experience respective fading of their own that varies with 
time and position. The discussion includes methodologies for calculating the levels 
of signals for use in general assignment of spectrum to operators (which requires 
consideration of how transmission by one organization can produce RFI into the 

Preface 
xi
operation of another) and end users. Area coverage models such as Okamura and 
Langley-Rice are discussed with regard to their applicability.
This brings us to Part III with Chapters 6, 7, and 8, addressing the subject 
of how RFI can be evaluated properly and dealt with effectively. First, we see in 
Chapter 6 how various forms of RFI affect the desired signals. It’s not enough to 
know how much RFI is present; we must know and be able to quantify the impact 
on a victim service from the presence of a given type and level of RFI. Much of the 
effort in RFI resolution ends up going into this question, especially if parties to the 
discussion must agree on what is an acceptable impact on service quality for a given 
RFI condition. Fortunately, it can be addressed analytically using equations and 
computer number crunching, and through actual laboratory tests using the types 
of equipment to be fielded.
Chapter 6 gives some practical examples to provide a jumping off place for 
detailed study in a specific RFI case. These include quantitative studies done of 4G 
LTE sharing with radar and applicability of path analysis software available on 
the commercial market. Some proven ways of addressing RFI once it is identified 
and understood are covered in Chapters 7 and 8. There is never a final answer to 
all cases of RFI but Chapter 7 provides a number of proven tools and methodolo­
gies, especially spectrum analysis and spectrum monitoring. Chapter 8 follows in 
a similar vein by laying out practical spectrum planning techniques that can be 
introduced in many cases. This listing grows with time, as we gain experience with 
new systems and as technology advances in such areas as radio direction finding 
(RDF) and RFI cancellation.
In looking ahead, we offer Chapter 9 as a prospective for RFI resolution in 
future radiocommunication systems. Most of what we need is already known and 
being applied on a piece-meal basis. But, new models of how spectrum could be al­
located and shared are of great interest in a world where more services are desired 
by the global population. We address the topic of cognitive radio, where intelli­
gence within the system uses “white spaces” of spectrum that is currently lost due 
to the rigid rules of allocation and limitations on radio network management. So 
far, this topic has been of interest mainly to researchers in universities and regula­
tors wishing to grant more access. In time, many of these ideas will be tested in 
limited trials (in the US and elsewhere), and some will be implemented to mitigate 
the RFI that comes with increasing access to spectrum.
This book comes out of the author’s 50 years of experience with radiocommu­
nication in general and work involving RFI in particular. It’s not that one starts out 
to be an RFI practitioner; it happens as you get involved with real radiocommu­
nication systems and have to solve these problems as they are recognized to exist 
or, worse, when they raise their ugly heads. There is profound hope in our ability 
to understand RFI and find those solutions that work and are economical. But, as 
is always the case with systems engineering practices, you can pay for the solution 
now, or pay a lot more later.
The author wishes to thank the organizations and individuals who contributed

professor at CCNY. Also vital to the success of this project was the encouragement 
from the staff at Artech, including the publisher, and the acquisition team who as­
sisted at each step. The technical reviewer, Ray Sperber, really took on this project 
as a partner so that it represents the real world in all its dimensions and maintains 
its validity and relevancy in the years ahead. The original idea for a book on RFI 
arose in Indonesia in the late 1970s during the Palapa satellite project, with the 
help and encouragement of R. Wikanto and Dr. Arifin Nugroho of the Indonesian 
Public Telecom Corporation (PERUMTEL).
I want to express my heartfelt appreciation and love for my wife, Cathy, and 
our two wonderful daughters, Sheri and Michelle. They are the ones who make a 
book like this become a reality.

The What and Why of RFI in Radio and 
Wireless Communications
Radio frequencies (RFs) lie in the broad spectral range of 100 kHz to 100 GHz and 
employ the principles of radio wave propagation and electrical communications. 
We concern ourselves here with how what emanates from a transmitting antenna 
of one radiocommunication system causes radio frequency interference (RFI) that 
enters the receiving antenna of another. By “what,” we mean the fact that one 
radio signal can deteriorate proper reception of other radio signals by preventing 
the associated receiver from properly detecting the information, or data, on that 
particular signal. By “why,” we mean that the RF spectrum must be shared by many 
users and many applications in point-to-point communications and broadcasting; 
as a result, no user can expect to enjoy any particular part of the spectrum on a 
dedicated basis. These principles are explored in detail in this book, but the idea is 
relatively simple.
RFI is something that occurs by the very nature of this means of communica­
tion; as spectrum use increases, so does RFI. It is analogous to vehicle traffic on 
highways and streets. With little or no traffic (e.g., at 2 a.m.), traffic flows freely 
at the posted speed; with high traffic (during rush hour in major cities), traffic is 
intense and we all have to watch out carefully as we drive. That doesn’t mean that 
traffic cannot be handled in heavy situations; just that there must be techniques and 
tools to help address those places and periods of congestion. Similar analogies can 
be drawn with respect to flying airplanes on air routes. 
RFI is one category of a much broader field of electromagnetic practice 
involving:
••
Electromagnetic interference (EMI) is disturbance that affects an electrical 
circuit due to either electromagnetic induction or electromagnetic radiation 
emitted from an external source. EMI occurs due to physical proximity of 
components and elements of an electronic device or system, whether through 
cabinets, cables, or antennas. RFI is a subset of EMI, as discussed above.
••
Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) is the branch of electrical sciences 
which studies the unintentional generation, propagation, and reception of 
electromagnetic energy with reference to the unwanted effects that such en­
ergy may induce. The goal of EMC is the correct operation, in the same elec­
tromagnetic environment, of different equipment that uses electromagnetic

phenomena, and the avoidance of any interference effects. Emission issues 
are related to the unwanted generation of electromagnetic energy by some 
source, and to the countermeasures that should be taken to reduce such gen­
eration and avoid the escape of any remaining energies into the external en­
vironment. Susceptibility or immunity issues, in contrast, refer to the correct 
operation of electrical equipment, referred to as the victim, in the presence 
of unplanned electromagnetic disturbances.
The mechanisms for EMI are illustrated in Figure 1.1 [1]. We see many paths for 
EMI to take, beginning at the signal line with conducted coupling at the bottom and 
multiple other potential paths crisscrossing among the principle elements of both 
the interfering and interfered-with (victim) systems. At the top is the RFI path (of 
primary interest in this book), indicating radiated coupling between the antennas 
(the dashed arrow). Keep in mind that we are speaking of two normally uncon­
nected systems and that the radiated coupling is undesired. It should be possible 
to eliminate the non-RFI paths through proper design, construction, and testing 
of each of the operating systems. Often, one of these paths ends up the cause of a 
specific interference issue. When RFI arises in an operating system, we often must 
consider all paths for the interference to take, which makes this illustration particu­
larly valuable.
The definitions of EMI and EMC are meant to distinguish these related (and 
important) practices from our focus on RFI. The radiocommunication systems op­
erating on licensed or otherwise authorized frequencies can meet all of the relevant 
EMC requirements and still cause RFI to one another. This is because one person’s 
RFI is another person’s communication, and vice versa. It is up to the designers 
and operators of these radiocommunication systems to minimize how RFI impacts 
their respective operations. To address and control RFI (i.e., the “how”), we use 
the same principles of radio engineering as are applied to the design of the systems 
Figure 1.1  Coupling of EMI between two different radio systems [1]. RFI is illustrated as “radiated 
coupling” between the antennas; all other paths are unintentional and avoidable (although still pos­
sible in a working system).

themselves. The following summary of radio engineering is to provide readers with 
this background.
1.1  Engineering of Radiocommunication and Wireless Systems in Light 
of RFI
RFI appears in the receiver of a radiocommunication system like the thermal noise 
from the atmosphere and produced within active devices like amplifiers and mixers, 
and any type of passive matter that produces signal attenuation. From a technical 
standpoint, RFI may be equivalent to an amount of thermal noise, or if consider­
ably different, as a unique interfering signal. Many radiocommunication systems, 
such as cellular mobile radio and satellite transmissions, have internal forms of RFI 
that are evaluated as part of the operation of that particular system. Engineering in 
this context consists of techniques for analysis and means to take corrective action, 
and the methodologies for accomplishing this within the constraints of radiocom­
munication system operation.
Figure 1.2 illustrates the generic nature of a radiocommunication system, pro­
viding a point-to-point link. The transmitter contains a microphone that represents 
the information source, a modulator to transfer the information signal into a radio 
carrier suitable for transmission, and a transmitting antenna. From there, the car­
rier is propagated over the medium (to be discussed in detail) and received by the 
receiving antenna and the distant receiver. Electromagnetic energy is converted by 
the antenna into an electrical signal that is transferred to the demodulator. There is 
a bandpass filter between the receiving antenna transmission line and the demodu­
lator for the purpose of restricting the bandwidth to only that of the desired carrier. 
As such, it is the principle element that protects the receiver from unwanted signals 
that couple through the receiving antenna. The recovered information is amplified 
before it is applied to a loudspeaker. Modern radiocommunication systems transfer

information in digital form and employ modulation with digital coding to maxi­
mize the capacity and reduce the effects of distortion and interference that result 
from transmission and propagation. 
Any system that radiates from antennas in the typical frequency bands is po­
tentially a source (or receiver) of RFI from other radiocommunication systems. 
Examples of the former include radars, RF identification (RFID) systems, and navi­
gations systems using Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) system, and other radio 
techniques. Within the radio spectrum, we see allocations for all of the applications 
that employ RF and wireless schemes. Any and all can become part of a particular 
RFI issue.
All this may appear to be uncontrollable and beyond precise investigation; 
however, the basic physics behind all RFI issues and concerns are well known and 
quantifiable. This book provides a review of the relevant principles involving an­
tennas and RF devices, mathematics of electromagnetism, radio wave propaga­
tion in free space and on obstructed paths, communications technologies involving 
signal processing and detection, and engineering principles such as budgeting and 
design specifications, for considering RFI in modern radiocommunication systems 
on land, sea, in the air, and in space.
RFI may not obey national borders, but it can be constrained by geography. 
Propagation in free space is governed by the inverse square law, wherein the signal 
strength decreases by a factor of 4 (6 dB) for each doubling of distance. According 
to the range equation, also called the Friis transmission equation, the attenuation 
due to a free space path of distance R and at a wavelength λ can be expressed as
	
2
0
4 R
A
π
λ


= 


	
According to this equation, the attenuation as a ratio is also inversely propor­
tional to the square of the wavelength, which means that it is directly proportional 
to the square of the frequency (e.g., f=c/λ). In Figure 1.3 free space loss is plotted 
for frequencies of 1 and 10 GHz (or wavelengths of 30 and 3 cm) as a function of 
R, in the range of 10 to 10,000 km. Attenuation at 10 GHz is 20 dB greater than 
that at 1 GHz.
If we rely on range alone (and not isolation afforded by blockage or absorp­
tion), increasing the distance from 10 km to 10,000 km (a factor of 1,000) provides 
60 dB of protection from RFI. Such protection is called isolation in RFI terms.
Isolation on the ground is provided by the presence of the ground itself, in 
conjunction with variation in geography, due to hills, buildings, vegetation, and so 
forth. Figure 1.4 compares free space attenuation, governed by the inverse square 
law, with attenuation produced by diffraction and reflection by typical ground. 
Frequencies of 900 and 1,800 MHz are given over a distance range of 1 m to 10 
km. The smooth curve at the bottom is based on the same equation as that provid­
ed in Figure 1.3, adjusted for 900 MHz instead of 1 GHz. The other curves include 
the effect ground reflection, diffraction, and absorption, resulting in greater attenu­
ation than from free space propagation. Beyond a distance greater than 1,000 m (1 
km), the attenuation on the above Earth path follows a power of four (4) instead of 
two (2). Therefore, a doubling of distance reduces signal strength by a factor of 16, 

1.1  Engineering of Radiocommunication and Wireless Systems in Light of RFI 
7
or 12 dB. That is 6 dB more than free space propagation would indicate. This extra 
isolation helps with the reassignment of the same spectrum to a separate geographi­
cal region. This figure indicates that at a distance of 10 km, the attenuation of the 
path over the Earth experiences 20 dB more attenuation than that in free space.
Having an obstacle, such as a hill or building, adds significant attenuation 
through the principle of diffraction and blockage. The amount of attenuation de­
pends on the frequency, distance, and degree to which the obstacle penetrates the 
line-of-sight path. This will be addressed in detail in Chapter 5. As an example, 
Figure 1.5 is the profile of a path between an interfering transmitter and a receiving

point approximately 20 km away. There are several tall hills in the way, reducing 
the received RFI by in excess of 80 dB. Thus, near-complete isolation is afforded. In 
other cases, the diffraction loss from an obstacle will range between 6 and 20 dB, 
necessitating precise calculation using the principles reviewed in Chapter 5.
1.1.1  Efficient Use of Radio Spectrum
One of the truths about radiocommunication is that the RF spectrum is a limited 
resource, a limitation posed by the very RFI that we evaluate in this book. In an 
ideal world, we have ample spectrum to play with and its cost would, like the air, be 
free. After all, it takes a considerable investment to be able to transmit signals and 
thus occupy spectrum. The introduction of extensive radio infrastructure for broad­
casting and cellular/wireless has resulted in crowding of the bands as these systems 
reach almost everybody. The spectrum is divided into ranges, called bands, that 
allow for specific sets of services to be provided. Thus, the users within particular 
bands, such as 11.7 to 12.2 GHz for satellites that broadcast TV signals and 1,850 
to 1,920 MHz for 3G and 4G mobile wireless services, transmit very similar signals 
and can be considered to be homogeneous. That means that carrier characteristics 
and susceptibility to RFI are comparable among users of the particular band. This 
approach has been followed for almost 100 years and reduces uncertainty in the 
realm of RFI. 
Allocations of bands are made by the International Telecommunication Union 
(ITU) through the auspices of the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC) 
held every three or four years in Geneva, Switzerland. The ITU Table of Frequen­
cy Allocations [2], along with how these are carried forward within a particular 
country or jurisdiction, provides spectrum for applications in the wireless domain. 
The band allocations are contained in the first of four volumes of the Radio Regu­
lations, a free download from the ITU website (www.itu.int). There are literally

hundreds of spectrum allocations across the RF range, broken down among three 
ITU regions: (1) Europe and Africa, (2) North and South America, and (3) Asia and 
the Pacific. There are three major communication application areas: Fixed Service, 
providing communication between points on the ground, Mobile Service, among 
mobile platforms on ground, on water and in the air, and Broadcasting Service, the 
one-to-many application for distributing information and programming. There are 
comparable satellite-specific services in the three domains: Fixed Satellite Service 
(FSS), Mobile Satellite Service (MSS), and Broadcasting Satellite Service (BSS).
1.1.2  Frequency Band Assignments
In any given country, there is a national frequency regulatory body, such to the Fed­
eral Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States, and Ofcom in the 
United Kingdom.  Because radio waves do not recognize national borders, however, 
there is an overall international coordination effort through the ITU.
Other applications include radio navigation and radiolocation (radar and di­
rection finding), radio astronomy, space research, and amateur (ham) radio. As 
relates to radiocommunication, the tables discriminate between Earth-based (ter­
restrial) applications and satellite-based (space) applications. The tables cover over 
130 pages and include footnotes that add to or subtract from the allocations, as 
prescribed for a particular country or countries. There is a saying that what the 
table of allocation provides, the footnotes take away (they add as well). Guidelines 
exist for individual governments when authorizing users and operators in their 
respective countries; generally speaking, they follow these allocations reasonably 
well. A particular government may deviate from the standard allocations to accom­
modate specific users, who could be government agencies or private companies or 
groups. A general rule is that when a government or its assignee fails to follow the 
table, they must not cause harmful interference to those who do.
Another important aspect of the Radio Regulations is the processes they de­
scribe for how countries apply for and obtain internationally recognized protec­
tion of their particular use of spectrum. This is because radio waves do not obey 
national borders, an aspect of the technology that led to the development of these 
rules and allocations in the first place. The approach taken is that of frequency 
coordination and registration of spectrum use, including the use of satellite orbits. 
The procedures are laid out in detail, and ITU members are treated as equals before 
the Radio Regulations and the ITU bureaucracy. A brief discussion of this system is 
provided in the next section and further in our other work [3].
International and national rules for use of spectrum limit the frequency range 
and power of transmission as a means of increasing utilization. In addition, users 
are required to minimize the amount of energy radiated outside of their authorized 
bandwidth. This is especially important where frequencies are used to receive very 
weak signals, such as from spacecraft and distant stars (i.e., radio astronomy). 
Legacy and incumbent radio systems often receive special protection due to their 
extensive use and sometimes antiquated technology. There are cases where a pro­
spective user with a new application must pay these incumbents to facilitate their 
transfer to new frequencies or even retirement.

The What and Why of RFI in Radio and Wireless Communications
1.1.3  Efficient Use of the Geostationary Satellite Orbit and Other Space 
Environments
There is value to having spectrum applied to the purposes of highest importance or 
economic value. Sometimes, regulations end up holding spectrum resources back 
from their best use in terms of allowing more access and application. We see this 
play out in licensed wireless spectrum where terrestrial operators pay billions of dol­
lars to acquire the spectrum they need to meet demand and remain competitive. In 
the satellite domain, most usable Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) orbit positions 
are occupied by operators established decades ago. This resulted from a general 
presumption that an operator may replace a satellite in an existing orbit location 
with another of equal or better performance when the prior satellite either reaches 
end of life or experiences a failure. To economize on spacecraft vehicles, some op­
erators have joined together on shared communications satellites. The overall RFI 
environment, discussed later in this book, is well understood and reasonably well 
contained within the GEO domain.
An aspirant operator with capital and operational resources will find it dif­
ficult, but not impossible, to obtain an appropriate GEO orbit longitude location 
through the process defined in the ITU Radio Regulations in conjunction with the 
system of licensing from a particular host country. The licensing bodies have vary­
ing degrees of experience with the process; the regulators in the United States, the 
Russian Federation, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Luxembourg, 
Hong Kong, Japan, Brazil, Malaysia, and Indonesia having been at the game the 
longest. Completing the ITU and national regulatory process will take from two 
the five years, and there is risk that the assignment may end up being contested. 
The process is illustrated in Figure 1.6.
There are cases where holders of licenses and prior registrations of the ITU 
have sold or otherwise transferred their right to a location to a new operator or an 
Figure 1.6  Basic structure applied to the process of obtaining a new orbit location through the 
auspices of the ITU and a domestic regulatory body (administration).

existing operator needing expansion capacity. For example, the Kingdom of Tonga 
registered many orbit locations in order to rent them to prospective satellite opera­
tors. Intentional RFI has occurred on a few occasions as disputes boil over. The 
Isle of Man has become a popular jurisdiction for satellite companies wishing to 
obtain orbit locations, although the actual jurisdiction is the UK. There have also 
been outright purchases of operating satellites by operators in different countries 
and the associated licenses and ITU registrations have crossed borders. While the 
process is legal, it nevertheless can result in disagreements involving countries and 
their associated satellite operators.
The basic mechanisms of orbital RFI can be seen in Figure 1.7, which illustrates 
the geometry between the satellites in GEO and the transmitting and receiving 
Earth stations. The case of uplink interference, shown in the left, results not from 
the adjacent satellite but from the Earth station transmitting to that satellite. We 
see how energy radiated in off angles from the Earth station antenna can reach the 
satellite on the left, potentially interfering with the carrier coming up from the asso­
ciated earth station on the left. Downlink interference, illustrated on the right side 
of the figure, is what we would normally associate with orbital RFI. The adjacent 
satellite (on the right) radiates toward both receiving Earth stations, including the 
one on the left that is not intended as a point of reception. Interference enters that 
Earth station antenna through its off angle and thus can interfere with the desired 
signal coming from the left-hand satellite.
Non-GEO orbit constellations like Iridium and O3b involved a somewhat dif­
ferent process because only one such constellation can operate in a particular fre­
quency band at a time. Iridium engaged the FCC and the entire membership of the 
ITU to obtain its ability to launch something that had not been done before. O3b 
rode on the coattails of a previous effort called Teledesic that did not itself proceed. 
It is therefore a different process to gain access to non-GEO orbital spectrum re­
sources and more time could be required than for the typical GEO satellite. One of 
the reasons for this is that RFI would occur as satellites move through the sky and 
at an altitude considerably below GEO. Thus, terrestrial radiocommunication and 
GEO satellite systems may also be subject to a new source of RFI. The approach 
usually taken is to segment the particular frequency band so that the non-GEO

The What and Why of RFI in Radio and Wireless Communications
system has its own, noninterfering bandwidth to occupy. See Section 8.1.3 for a 
discussion of band segmentation.
1.2  Identifying RFI Modes and Consequences
We could call this RFI management because it encompasses the vital functions of 
reducing the problem to something that is manageable within the capabilities of 
the organization or industry. It can be broken up into the familiar discussion of 
Who, What, Why, When, Where, and How. We have to perform these studies and 
investigations well before the radiocommunication system is designed and brought 
into use, as well as after it is in operation when the RFI is actually experienced (at 
any time). Doing this within the system itself may be the easiest part of the problem 
because the characteristics of the radio stations and their locations are presumably 
known. The analysis can be performed according to the procedures in this book. 
What can be much more difficult is taking into account radiocommunication sys­
tems and radio emitters that are external. Some of these will exist prior to operation 
of the potentially interfered with system (the RFI going both ways), and some will 
come later when the undesired source (or receptor) of RFI appears on the scene. 
The impact could be anticipated if the new radio emitters must notify existing us­
ers through an established regulatory process, and the impacts determined before it 
goes live. Otherwise, it would be particularly troublesome because its characteris­
tics would not normally be known ahead of time.
1.3  Electromagnetic Compatibility and Spectrum Sharing
What we are trying to achieve when a new radio emitting system initiates operation 
is compatibility with all incumbent radiocommunication operations. Recall that 
all spectrum is shared among multiple user types and applications, using principles 
of RFI management. A review of the Table of Frequency Allocations of the ITU 
Radio Regulations makes it clear that spectrum sharing is in the DNA of all radio 
frequency assignment procedures. The Radio Regulations attempt to address this 
through technical rules governing how the frequencies are to be used with each 
service. If these rules are followed (and many are quite complex), spectrum sharing 
should work reasonably well. Actual enforcement of the rules is up to the member 
nations themselves and their regulatory agencies. Most of these entities lack criti­
cal resources for thorough review of license applications and monitoring the use 
of spectrum to identify violators. Companies like Aerosystems, Inc., of Canada, 
sell spectrum-monitoring systems that automate the scanning and verification of 
spectrum use in critical bands used by wireless and satellite operators. There are 
software tools that employ propagation models and mapping systems to predict 
RFI conditions and how one operator would have an impact on another. In addi­
tion, the operators themselves have a big stake in spectrum sharing and manage­
ment, both within their own bounds and on the borders where RFI can exceed an 
acceptable level.

1.4  Addressing RFI When It Occurs 
13
1.4  Addressing RFI When It Occurs
RFI incidents represent some of the more serious problems that beset radiocommu­
nication systems when we are dealing with an unknown assailant. The cause can 
be due to an equipment malfunction in our own system or in one within our field 
of view. It could come from the introduction of a new radio emitter or system of 
emitters of which we were unaware. Last, RFI can come from an intentional jam­
mer who wishes to disrupt the operation of a properly licensed or authorized user.
There are some tried-and-true techniques used in the troubleshooting of RFI 
incidents. These are can summarized as follows. More detail on measurement and 
mitigation techniques is presented in Chapter 7.
••
Is it from your own radio facility or system? Carefully review current opera­
tion and eliminate the possibility that the RFI is internally caused. All poten­
tial sources must be reviewed and eliminated from consideration.
••
Are there other “usual suspects”? These are RFI sources that have appeared 
in the past. Build a database of RFI incidents and corrective actions taken.
••
How can I gather facts to allow deductive reasoning? Use instrumentation 
such as a portable spectrum analyzer (discussed in Chapter 7), along with 
detailed reports from credible sources; from this, brainstorm what the pos­
sible RFI sources could be and how to gather additional data for verification 
and corrective action.
••
How can I get the attention and cooperation of possible sources? RFI identi­
fication and resolution, especially in the satellite communications and micro­
wave fields, involves getting the word out to all potential sources. Often, the 
RFI results from an issue with otherwise properly working equipment. The 
perpetrator has a stake in finding the source because it may accompany a loss 
of service on their end. Involve those entities that can assist with the process, 
including the high-level service operator (e.g., the satellite operator or domes­
tic telecom operator) as well as other users of the same or adjoining spectrum.
These are practical guidelines to get started in any RFI investigation, but the 
devil is in the details. Take advantage of all of the brains and thinking that come 
from good research as well as failure modes and effects analysis. Often, the process 
itself has its way of resolving the RFI issue even if the actual cause is never identi­
fied. More information and guidelines are provided in Chapter 8. A very serious 
RFI situation that prevents service may require its treatment as an incident in the 
context of emergency management is discussed in Section 8.4.

The Radiocommunication System in an 
Interference-Limited Environment
RFI management is but one aspect of the design and operation of a radiocommuni­
cation system serving some population or set of users. We recognize that the limited 
spectrum considered in Chapter 1 is what forces engineers to take RFI seriously in 
the development of a system in the first place. The overall RF design of the system 
will be driven by the communications requirements, discussed next. How RFI af­
fects this design can only be assessed as the architecture comes together and choices 
are made for the radio terminals and repeaters, and as locations are identified and 
exploited. This is an ongoing process, and so RFI planning needs to be integrated 
throughout the system lifetime (planning, building, and running). It will impact 
the particular part of the spectrum employed, as different allocations bring with 
them different bandwidth constraints, propagation characteristics, degree of prior 
occupancy by incumbents, potential for new entrants, and physical characteristics 
such as antenna designs, heights, application of shielding, choice of modulation 
and coding methods, and so on. This also goes for properties of orbiting satellites 
if these are included in the mix.
2.1  Radiocommunication Requirements
Radiocommunication systems are best developed through the time-tested process 
of systems engineering, the first step of which is to define the requirements for the 
services. These are identified in the communications field by answering the familiar 
questions, who, what, where, when, and how. Engineers generally get engaged in 
the “how” phase, but we must restrain our inclination to jump into the specific de­
sign/development process. There is also the tendency to repeat a design and concept 
that was used successfully in the past, even if it is suboptimal or even problematic 
in the current environment. It is also interesting that while the RFI properties of a 
previous radiocommunication system might have been well understood and con­
tained, it does not follow that RFI in the next context will likewise be under control. 
Any significant changes in the aforementioned characteristics will change how RFI 
is produced and must be resolved.

The Radiocommunication System in an Interference-Limited Environment
2.1.1  Who: The Organization or Market
Radiocommunication systems are conceived to meet a set of needs of some popula­
tion or market. The Family Radio system provides simple handheld push-to-talk ra­
dios, similar to the “walky-talky” used by the United States in World War II. These 
devices operate on unlicensed frequencies and so are expected not to interfere with 
licensed users. More elaborate wireless systems are employed in the cellular tele­
phone network, involving many base stations intended to cover the area of opera­
tion of the general public. Both radiocommunication systems support a handheld 
device, but the cellular requirements are much more demanding and the capabilities 
are substantially greater as well. It is a testimony to the ability of radio to provide a 
solid connection for voice and other applications that cellular systems have reached 
such magnitude and diversity of use. One key is to match the terminal device to the 
user and the associated application or applications. Often, the terminal design is 
heavily driven by how and where (discussed below) it is used.
The applications typically follow some kind of laundry list of particular uses, 
suggested by the following:
••
Voice/telephone services (billed by the minute or monthly for unlimited use)
••
Text, paging
••
Video conference
••
Internet access
••
Content distribution (sound, video, etc.)
••
Distance learning
••
Telemedicine
••
Netted radio (push to talk), and
••
Real-time control (machine-to-machine)
One question that comes to mind is whether these services are provided over a 
common network (which is effectively what we have with the Internet) and if they 
are delivered to a standard and common terminal design (like the smartphone or 
notepad computer). Larger devices can have larger antennas and transmit more 
power; smaller devices can be taken almost anywhere and used in very difficult 
environments.
Each of these has associated with it a basic requirement for data throughput 
in bits per second (bps), time duration and frequency of use (use statistics), service 
reliability (whether data delivery is guaranteed or “best efforts”), latency or delay, 
and so forth. Voice services are tolerant of variable quality and dropped bits, but 
latency needs to be kept to less than 1 second, round trip. Video is a bandwidth 
hog but may not be sensitive to delay. Machine-to-machine communications covers 
the gambit of commercial, industrial, and military uses, where lost bits or excessive 
delay could result in disaster. 
The “who” step in the systems engineering process is often the most difficult 
because it forces participants and stakeholders to make choices before anything is 
cast in concrete. Many have a very hard time being specific about their needs. In a 
commercial market, potential customers or subscribers can’t imagine what the new 

2.1  Radiocommunication Requirements 
17
service will do for them. Demonstrations and trials go a long way, but until people 
live and breathe with the terminal device and service they are at a loss to know how 
it will impact their work and their lives. The same goes for how RFI would impair 
or otherwise impact acceptance and ultimate success. An RFI incident can produce 
dropped calls, reduced throughput, capacity bottlenecks, and failure to connect at 
all. The system designer must think in many domains: like a user considering where 
and how to use the service, like a terminal device with its software, like a spectrum 
manager who considers where the bandwidth will come from and how RFI finds 
its way through the system, like a businessperson considering the ultimate capital 
and operating costs, and like a marketing person finding that marketing mix that 
will achieve the revenue requirements.
2.1.2  What: Network Topology and Frequencies
System design in radiocommunication is an iterative process, and it is often difficult 
to know when enough is known to move ahead with detailed engineering activities. 
Having identified the market and applications, the system engineer can begin to 
create a network topology. This is a scheme for using radio links, augmented by ter­
restrial links from fiber-optic cables and other such systems, to provide an overlay 
that reaches every point of service. This couples with the next step that considers 
where services are to be provided. A star topology uses a hub station as a central 
connection point with all remote terminals connected directly to it. Alternatively, 
a mesh topology does not use a hub; rather, remote terminals may communicate 
directly with each other. Also, you can combine star and mesh to address different 
needs in one overall structure. This is not unlike how cellular telephone operates 
using a base station to cover a cell, and terrestrial links by fiber and microwave to 
connect a myriad of stations back to the central switch. In Chapter 9, we consider 
some advanced concepts such as cognitive radio.
2.1.3  Where: Locations to Be Served
Telecommunications systems, whether by radio or physical means, accomplish 
what the name means: transmission of human intelligence over a distance. The 
network topology comes about as a more effective way to connect any and all users 
to the information resources they require or desire. Included is the interpersonal 
interactive element we expect from telephone services along with video-enabled 
connections (Skype, etc.). Radio has the special benefit of allowing almost complete 
freedom of location and the ability to communicate while in motion. Unlike fiber 
and copper lines, radio links are subject to RFI since they incorporate antennas that 
allow both wanted and unwanted electromagnetic waves to be received. The anten­
nas on the base station, the user terminal device, the very small aperture terminal 
(VSAT) Earth station, the satellite itself, and any other radio receiver are exposed to 
threat of impaired operation because of RFI. These threats are addressed through 
proper design, as discussed throughout this book. The more spread out the radio 
links are over a geographic region, the more opportunity there is for RFI to find 
that weak link.
There are two basic approaches to the RFI evaluation where radio links extend 
over a relatively wide area. The first is to establish a worst case where the radio 

18 
��������������������������������������������������������������������
The Radiocommunication System in an Interference-Limited Environment
terminal is receiving the weakest level of desired signal and at the same time subject 
to the largest RFI level. Then, the logic goes, service performance everywhere else 
will be better. This is a highly conservative approach that can burden the overall 
system with high cost or even render it impractical. The second approach involves 
a lot more work as it is based in evaluating RFI impact at every potential point in 
the overall radiocommunication network. Then, we can calculate levels of service 
impact, possibly on a percentage of quality basis at various points of coverage. Ra­
dio link performance can be enhanced by dynamic control when and where needed. 
Some of the computer and software tools to do this are on the commercial market; 
newer systems would require the development of custom software tools for the task 
at hand. Generally speaking, network operators are pursuing the latter approach as 
they tend to have substantial resources and a lot at stake. This is discussed further 
in Chapter 9. 
2.1.4  When: Timing for Fixed, Mobile, or Temporary Communications
Any new radiocommunication system will undergo a system development lifecycle. 
The initial step is to go from an idea to a conceptual framework, described in 
some kind of document or storyboard. Many assumptions will be made about the 
requirements to be addressed and the technology to be applied. From there, archi­
tecture studies are needed to address the “who,”  “what,” and “where” aspects. 
The timing to accomplish this can take from months to years, depending on the 
maturity of the market as well as the status of technology and its availability in 
the appropriate timeframe. The question of “when” is directed to the timeline for 
service introduction, coupled with the response of the market or environment to the 
presence of something new. It will also take time to identify and acquire the most 
appropriate spectrum, and to consider existing users who would be affected and 
could pose a threat. Section 6.4.2 presents an example of how a threat can under­
mine a new radiocommunication system.
2.1.5  How: Equipment and Other Resources
The actual engineering of the radiocommunication system commences with prepa­
ration of specifications for equipment and systems, based on analyses of the links 
and other characteristics discussed previously. The general process is illustrated in 
Figure 2.1, flowing from the user requirements and agreement on specifications, 
to optimization of the detailed design, link specification and operating characteris­
tics, installation and test, and troubleshooting as needed before demonstration of 
operating capability. This can be an iterative process, indicated by return loops at 
the design stage and as user terminals appear on the scene. RFI is a consideration 
during translation of requirements into a technical design; further, it must continue 
to be considered so that it does not become the focal point of troubleshooting after 
construction, when costs and time delays can be substantial.
The majority of terrestrial and satellite radio systems are designed in and 
around RFI that is of an internal nature. Generally speaking, the more users oper­
ating at a given time, the higher the level of this RFI. As stated previously, RFI can 
be treated as an equivalent increase in the noise level. The proviso is that it is of a 

2.2  Transmitters and Receivers 
19
steady nature. RFI that is pulsing or sweeps across the band will interfere when it is 
within the passband of the victim receiver and may have no impact at other times. 
Also to be considered are out-of-band signals that can overload preamplifiers and 
other active devices in the receive chain. This is of particular concern with regard to 
legacy systems that might have been designed to more relaxed specifications than 
for modern equipment in RFI-dominated environments.
The link budget is the primary tool for quantifying the key parameters that 
determine whether the service is possible or not. Figure 2.2 presents a basic illus­
tration to graphically display the progression through a link budget for a point-to-
point link. The carrier power level is indicated on the scale on the left in dBm. The 
particular path is free space, which is the ideal case discussed in Chapter 1. There 
will be additional losses on the path from the atmosphere, obstacles, multipath, 
and absorption from trees. These losses are resolved through higher transmit power 
and antenna gain on transmit and receive ends of the path. The receiver will experi­
ence both thermal noise and RFI that appears at the distant end. The widening of 
downward-sloping link power across the path is meant to represent how received 
power varies due to factors such as multipath and presence of obstacles.
Diagrams of the type shown in Figures 2.1 and 2.2 are created for the project 
and system at hand and will no doubt need updating from time to time. Documen­
tation such as the above needs to be maintained to define the “as built” state and 
to track issues and failures, as well as their remedies.
2.2  Transmitters and Receivers
We will now discuss transmitters and receivers to give an overview for all further 
investigation of RFI later in this book. Radiocommunication stations are all pretty 
much the same as they must contain elements that transmit as well as receive (for

ting only).  Figure 2.3 shows the major blocks of the transmitter and receiver, with 
the channel in the middle. The upper diagram is for analog transmission, generally 
obsolete in today’s environment. That said, it indicates the basics of how a user 
information source is processed, modulated, and applied to an RF stage (the actual 
transmitter). The receiving side is basically the reverse direction. The lower diagram

is for a digital chain that consists of more elements because the user information 
must be converted from analog form and then processed to reduce the bit rate 
(through compression) and encoded to improve the error-rate performance over the 
channel to the right. There has been a trend for the digitization and compression to 
be performed within the source device, such as a digital telephone or camera. The 
baseband segments of the transmit and receive chains are shown within the dotted 
boxes.
We will examine the digital transmitter and receiver in detail in the remaining 
chapters. To do this, we must consider how the RF stages on transmit and receive 
sides of the station interact with potential and existing RFI that is prevalent over 
the channel. The latter consists of all aspects of radiowave propagation as well as 
the detailed properties of the transmitting and receiving antennas. Through a de­
tailed knowledge of the RFI “entries” in the channel we are in a position to assess 
its impact on radiocommunication. The transmitters themselves also are capable 
of causing RFI to the receiving equipment at this and other stations through inter­
modulation and harmonic generation.
The receiver and transmitter baseband sections, within the dotted boxes, are 
nevertheless essential to the evaluation of RFI. Compression and coding systems 
can make the link more susceptible to RFI, depending on the nature of the interfer­
ence. Noiselike RFI would be easy to evaluate because coding systems are intended 
to correct errors in the presence of thermal, also called Gaussian, noise. Swept or 
pulsing interference could be a different matter where the effect will depend on the 
duty cycle for the presence of interference within the passband of the receiver. This 
can be seen in the comparison between continuous and pulsed RFI in Figure 2.4. 
Various types of pulsed interference are suggested, indicating a broad range of po­
tential sources. Continuous forms of RFI result from digital carriers including code 
division multiple access (CDMA), as well as unmodulated carriers used as reference 
signals (the pilot carrier on terrestrial digital TV signals being a good example).

are suggested for each category. Time waveforms are shown at the bottom.

The Radiocommunication System in an Interference-Limited Environment
2.2.1  Modem Properties
The modulator, or demodulator (modem), is that part of the receiver where desired 
carrier, noise, and RFI interact, producing final signal data. The placement and 
functions of its critical components are shown in Figure 2.5. Much of the perfor­
mance behavior under various forms of RFI can be explained in terms of these ele­
ments. Further details on digital modem design can be found in [1]. The following 
discussion highlights key sensitivities. The binary data at the input at the top-left 
already include any preprocessing such as compression, encryption, and forward-
error correction (FEC) coding. The driver amplifier establishes a fixed level, and 
the low pass filter limits the bandwidth of the pulse stream to that which is needed 
for proper demodulation. It shapes and constrains the baseband bandwidth to the 
minimum required, which is typically 10% to 20% greater than the bit rate (later, 
this becomes the symbol rate). The multiplier in the diagram performs modulation 
using the carrier provided by a local oscillator. In the case of time division multiple 
access (TDMA), which uses burst transmission, the carrier is turned on and off 
using a TDMA control signal synchronized to the network. The carrier from the 
oscillator now contains modulation in the form of a double sideband, suppressed 
carrier signal centered on the intermediate frequency (IF). A bandpass filter selects 
the upper sideband and removes and spurious frequencies (spurs). It is followed by 
amplification and final level adjustment before application to the RF aspect of the 
transmitting station. The resulting modulated signal has a constant spectral density

over 80% or 90% of its occupied bandwidth, with a symmetrical rolloff to zero. 
From an RFI perspective, the signal has a rectangular shape and the total power 
is the simple product of the bit rate times the constant spectral density previously 
mentioned.
The demodulator section of the station is its principal receptor of RFI, along 
with the noise from the received path. After the RF equipment, the carrier enters 
the IF amplifier. Identified in the diagram is the bandpass filter (BPF), which sets 
the input bandwidth for reception. It determines the amount of thermal noise that 
the demodulator must accept and rejects out of band RFI. Any RFI and noise 
within the bandwidth of the BPF passes through to the demodulator as it cannot 
be eliminated through filtering. This then sets the carrier to interference plus noise 
ratio of the link, the key determinant of bit error rate (BER). Following the BPF is a 
level adjust or automatic gain control (AGC) that maintains constant carrier power 
level into the demodulation circuitry to follow. If the level is too low, the remain­
ing components cannot extract carrier and data, and if it is too high, the devices 
saturate and cannot function property.
A three-way power divider delivers the same carrier to three critical operations 
in the demodulator. Actual demodulation requires a pure sinewave on precisely the 
same frequency to multiply against (mix with) the modulated carrier, present on 
the top arm of the power divider. The unmodulated carrier is produced by a phase-
locked oscillator in the carrier recovery circuit; the frequency reference for that 
oscillator comes from the received carrier, on the middle arm of the power divider. 
Modern demodulators employ direct digital synthesis (DDS) to produce an ideally 
synchronized sinewave [2]. The actual carrier frequency is subject to modification 
along the link: it begins within the modulator but is modified by the RF equipment 
of the transmitting and receiving station, along with Doppler on the path and any 
other frequency changes that might be produced in a repeater or other equipment. 
Thus, the carrier recovery circuit tracks the incoming frequency to remove error 
or jitter. The ability of the demodulator to recover the original baseband is related 
again to the ratio of carrier to noise power; RFI will increase this degradation until 
carrier recovery is not possible.
The last step in demodulation is the actual detection of the data in terms of 
ones and zeros. This is accomplished by the bit decision circuit shown at the top 
right. At a rate equal to the original bit rate, it measures the baseband signal at the 
optimum time to capture maximum energy of each bit. Simply stated, a 1 bit is 
established by a positive voltage and a 0 bit by a negative voltage. The bit timing 
recovery circuit, shown at the bottom, is a standard phased-locked loop configura­
tion where the I-channel signal is phased compared with respect to the bit timing 
clock stream. Like the carrier recovery loop, it obtains ideal bit timing from the 
incoming carrier on the bottom leg of the power divider.
The final step of obtaining ones and zeros is by the big decision circuit in the 
basic form of an integrate and dump filter. This classical device captures the en­
ergy of the bit during the symbol period to deliver a peak voltage for the decision 
process. Implementation in DSP provides for proper integration with minimal loss, 
and achieves ideal performance in the presence of thermal noise. A favored tech­
nique is maximum-likelihood detection, which analyzes more data to minimize the 
error probability.

The Radiocommunication System in an Interference-Limited Environment
This description relates to the most basic form of digital modulation, BPSK. As 
we move up the chain of methods that improve the spectrum use efficiency, most of 
these features are retained. The two variables used in modulation, amplitude and 
phase, allow designers to squeeze more bits into the same bandwidth. But, the basic 
properties of modulation and demodulation do not change. Also, the carrier itself 
retains the same shape, with its nearly constant spectral density and corresponding 
tendency to produce and be affected by RFI. With more efficient modulation than 
BPSK, the occupied bandwidth is established by the symbol rate rather than the bit 
rate. It can be seen that the symbol contains some quantity of bits (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
etc.), so the symbol rate can be expressed using the simple equation
	
=
2( )
b
s
R
R
log q 	
where Rb is the bit rate into the modulator (including FEC bits) and q is the number 
of phase and amplitude states (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc.).
2.2.2  Frequency Conversion and Amplification
The RF part of the station provides two basic functions:  frequency conversion (also 
called translation), and power amplification. The former is required because a mod­
ulator typically operates in the relatively low frequency of the IF. The carrier thus 
produced contains the correct modulation but is not necessarily in the proper fre­
quency band or on the assigned frequency. This is accomplished by an upconverter 
that adds a fixed frequency to the value in the IF to move the carrier to the appro­
priate transmit frequency. The downconverter performs the reverse process in the 
receiving station to transfer the carrier from RF back to IF. Frequency conversion 
up in frequency is called upconversion, and moving it back down is called down­
conversion. Again, the process is linear in that the carrier modulation is unmodified 
by either function. A significant aspect of proper design of frequency converters is 
the suppression and/or avoidance of undesired frequencies created during the fre­
quency conversion process. As discussed in Chapter 8, such harmonics and spurs 
often become RFI sources that result from improper equipment design or operation.
Figure 2.6 provides two examples of downconversion; in (A), the process is 
done with a fixed downconversion frequency. The local oscillator frequency is sim­
ply subtracted from the incoming RF frequency in the multiplier block. A BPF 
follows the multiplier to be sure that only the difference frequency is selected. This 
particular design uses a crystal oscillator frequency which is multiplied up to the 
frequency to be subtracted from the RF frequency. Note the use of a phase-locked 
oscillator to improve performance in terms of stability and phase noise. In (B), the 
fixed crystal oscillator is replaced by a frequency synthesizer that allows the down­
converter to select any particular carrier frequency in the band of interest. This 
frequency-agile approach is more flexible than the design in (A), and is more com­
mon in radiocommunication systems. The frequency synthesizer may sometimes be 
used as the reference for the phase locked oscillator to provide for better frequency 
translation quality. The demodulator discussed previously and shown in Figure 2.5 

2.2  Transmitters and Receivers 
25
has automatic frequency control to address the small variation in frequency on the 
carrier itself. 
The block diagrams in Figure 2.6 contain amplifier stages to provide the de­
sired power level either on input or output. If this is an upconverter, than the final 
power amplifier will output sufficient RF power to close the link to the distant 
receiver. Most RF systems employ solid state amplifiers using gallium arsenide field 
effect transistor (GaAsFET) and gallium nitride (GaN) transistors. This provides 
good efficiency and linearity. The transmit chain may also include channel equal­
ization in the form of gain and phase compensation, predistortion, and other forms 
of linearization.
Up until this point, we have considered only a single channel of communica­
tions, from data input to RF output, and from RF input to data output. Often, 
there are multiple channels of communications involving several modems and fre­
quency conversion stages. It is possible to use a single RF amplifier to provide suf­
ficient power to several carriers, but this must consider intermodulation distortion 
generated in that amplifier stage. Amplifiers are characterized in terms of their 
single-carrier 1-dB compression point and third-order intermodulation intercept 
point. These parameters allow the designer to size the amplifier in terms of its 
maximum power and consequential intermodulation properties.
The nature and configuration of station equipment depends to a certain degree 
on application. We consider here three broad categories, relating more or less to 
how the spectrum is allocated by the ITU and local jurisdictions.

tion station; (A) provides a fixed frequency translation using a crystal reference; (B) provides variable

The Radiocommunication System in an Interference-Limited Environment
2.2.3  Land-Based Radiocommunication Concepts
This category is of course the foundation of all radiocommunication since it dates 
from the first services offered by Marconi at the start of the 20th century. With 
relatively short distances and elaborate base stations now available, user terminal 
devices are small, intricate, and highly developed. Who could have imagined the 
smartphone even 20 years ago? It contains all of the radio functions described 
above along with features of advanced computers and displays. Various types of 
fixed stations have beefier devices, including amplifiers and converters, to support 
high traffic volumes and a wide range of link conditions. Because of this variety, 
we are often forced to address the needs of the lowest common denominator of 
performance capability. Improvements come along but legacy systems often exist 
side by side. Improvements in digital signal processing (DSP) and software defined 
radio (SDR) are important to optimizing link quality and adapting the radios to 
changing situations. Eventually, all radios will provide for the flexibility needed to 
adapt to user conditions, including varying degrees of RFI. An example of the front 
end of a mobile device is given in Figure 2.7 [3]. Nothing here is functionally unique 
to this design; however, the innovation comes through miniaturization, SDR, and 
sophisticated control.
2.2.4  Space-Based Radiocommunication Concepts 
This is the broad category that includes all forms of satellite communications, used 
in the public and private sectors. We have written extensively in this field, delineat­
ing the characteristics of satellite repeater systems as well as all types of ground 
communications facilities and terminal devices. The basic elements match what is 
done in land-based radiocommunication, although many characteristics are modi­
fied to consider the length of the path (thousands of kilometers instead of thousands 
of meters) and the propagation characteristics, which are influenced by the tropo­
sphere (especially rain) and the ionosphere. As a result, power amplifiers can reach 
levels of kilowatts on the ground and hundreds of watts in space. Generally speak­
ing, space-based radiocommunication suffers from less RFI simply because there 
are fewer sources of it. Also, it is easier to locate a source of RFI using satellites, as

Journal.)

discussed in Chapter 7. But its effect can be no less debilitating than in land-based 
systems. 
Figure 2.8 presents the block diagram of a satellite repeater such as that em­
ployed in the transmission of TV and broadband data services. This is the general 
class of “bent pipe” repeater on board a geostationary satellite with coverage of an 
area such as a country or continent; it operates in the Region 2 Ku band used for 
fixed satellite services (FSS) (uplink in the range 14.0 to 14.5 GHz and downlink 
in the range 11.7 to 12.2 GHz). As such, any ground transmitter within its uplink 
beam and its operating frequency band (14.0 to 14.5 GHz) will enter the repeater 
and be transmitted back to Earth on a frequency equal to the difference between 
the uplink frequency and the translation frequency in wideband Section 1 (shown 
as 2.3 GHz). The total bandwidth of 500 MHz is divided into 12 transponders of 
36-MHz bandwidth. Each transponder is provided with a preamplifier/linearizer 
and a traveling-wave tube (TWT) power amplifier. More complicated types of sat­
ellites with multiple beams and frequency bands are operating, but the basic prin­
ciple of the bent pipe is almost universal. An exception is the on-board processor 
(OBP) type of repeater that provides high degrees of flexibility for signal routing 
and regeneration. In the design of an OBP, the details of signal structure must often 
be taken into account and the trend has been away from this approach in favor of 
the bend pipe. In this way, the satellite does not modify the signal itself, yet the RFI 
will be transferred along with it.
There are a variety of types of Earth stations that can employ an FSS satellite 
of this type. Figure 2.9 provides a simplified block diagram of a ground terminal 
used for Internet access services. VSATs of this type have proliferated in recent 
Figure 2.8  Block diagram of a typical satellite repeater for use in TV broadcasting or data communications. 
From the uplink range of 14.0 to 14.5 GHz, the band is amplified and translated to the downlink range of 11.7 
to 12.2 GHz, and then separated into 12 RF channels that are approximately 36 MHz wide; each RF channel 
is amplified by its own transponder TWT amplifier, and the resulting assembly is passively combined and re-
radiated to earth in the downlink beam.

years and are unattended. They can use the type of repeater shown in Figure 2.8 to 
reach a hub station with a large antenna; the hub transmits a wideband broadcast 
signal to many VSATs, which return data typically using one of the multiple access 
techniques, TDMA being most common.
The most critical VSAT element with respect to RFI is the antenna itself, usu­
ally a dish-type with feed. The example in Figure 2.9 employs an ortho-mode 
transducer (OMT) to combine transmit and receive waveguides using orthogonal 
linear polarization (nominally vertical and horizontal). RFI is generated by or en­
ters through the reflector, both in terms of cross-polarized interference (XPI) and 
adjacent satellite interference (ASI). The latter is addressed in the subsequent sec­
tion on antennas.
2.2.5  Communications in Space Research and Remote Sensing
Spacecraft in general and orbiting artificial satellites in particular have always been 
dependent on radiocommunication. The first tracking stations were intended for 
scientific purposes and these continue today to provide links to weather satellites, 
space telescopes, and missions to planets and comets. The farther away the space­
craft, the larger the ground station needed to provide communications. In some 
cases, repeaters on other spacecraft transfer data between the remote vehicle and 
the ground, reducing the demands on the earth station.
The NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) system, reviewed in Sec­
tion 4.1.4, initiated service in 1984 to support a diverse community of scientific 
and other spacecraft orbiting Earth and during launch phases. Operating in geo­
synchronous Earth orbit, a TDRS can acquire a spacecraft in S, X, Ku, or Ka bands 
Figure 2.9  The configuration of a VSAT for broadband satellite communications. The antenna is configured 
to use linear polarization and would have a diameter in the range of 0.6m to 1.8m, depending on the fre­
quency of operation and the satellite performance.

and relay transmissions in both directions, reducing dependency on earth stations 
around the globe. Applications also include relay of unmanned aircraft and science 
bases in Antarctica. From an RFI standpoint, the system has been relatively im­
mune because these bands are nearly dedicated to space research with little conflict.
The baseband systems involved with space research and remote sensing are 
quite different from their counterparts in communications. This is because the for­
mats used are customized for science and their high variability of path geometries 
and potentially much longer distances. Also, the spacecraft are not repeaters as 
such, which means that the uplink and the downlink are isolated from each other. 
This tends to reduce their sensitivity to RFI as does their use of specific frequency 
bands since it is not shared with other applications. Still, RFI is very much a con­
cern because stray and unintended signals can affect reception from distant sensors.
The previous discussion of transmitters and receivers was meant as an over­
view for all further investigation of RFI later in this book.
2.3  Antennas in Radiocommunication Services
We introduced the antenna as the primary means of RFI production and entry. Fig­
ure 1.1 presented the coupling of EMI between two different radio systems, where 
RFI is illustrated as “radiated coupling” between the antennas; all other paths are 
unintentional and avoidable. According to Stutzman and Thiele [4], “The radio 
antenna is an essential component in any radio system. An antenna is a device that 
provides a means for radiating or receiving radio waves. In other words, it provides 
the transition from guided waves on a transmission line to a “free space” wave (and 
vice versa in the receiving case).”
Any conductor can transmit and/or receive if exposed to free space. What dif­
ferentiates an antenna is that it is designed to deliver, or receive, a radio wave that 
can reach the intended destination or destinations. Below, we consider the wide 
range of alternatives that are employed across the broad range of applications. In 
addition to different intended radiation properties, there are difference in their RFI 
properties, something that is of utmost interest in the field of this book. 
2.3.1  Nondirectional Antenna Radiation Patterns
A nondirectional antenna is simply one that does not favor a particular direction, 
exemplified by what is on a vehicle or handset. The whip antenna that used to be 
common on cars for AM and FM reception is intended to be nondirectional for 
obvious reasons. While the whip is constrained to the horizontal plane, an omnidi­
rectional antenna has the ability to transmit and receive in a near-spherical volume 
to cover all directions at some level. In contrast, the ideal case of true-spherical 
radiation (uniform across 4π steradians) is the isotropic antenna, which can be 
visualized like a star in space. It is not physically realizable, however, because of 
the inability to couple power to or from it (i.e., it has an impedance of zero ohms). 
Any of these antennas lack ability to reject RFI on receive because they allow all 
directions to enter the receiver.
Two types of nondirectional antennas are illustrated in Figure 2.10: the half-
wave dipole antenna and the quarter-wave ground plane, or monopole antenna. 

30 
��������������������������������������������������������������������
The Radiocommunication System in an Interference-Limited Environment
These are the ideal dimensions and larger or smaller dimensions can be used with 
appropriate impedance matching. The dipole in (A) is oriented vertically and pro­
duces what appears to be a bidirectional pattern with nulls pointing upward and 
downward (indicated as “min.” or “no-signal” in the figure). Shown at (B) is a 
three-dimensional representation where the circles in (A) are rotated about the axis 
of the dipole itself. This has been described as the “donut” pattern because of its 
familiar shape. The dipole is often used as an element of more complex antenna 
designs, as will be discussed later. Now, if we substitute the ground for the lower 
half of the dipole we obtain the monopole given in the lower figure. The lower half 
is actually not there, and the ground provides a reflecting plane that mirrors the up­
per half of the pattern. With a good ground (such as a metal plate of sufficient size), 
the pattern has the same shape as half of a donut sliced across the axis marked 
“max.” in the upper figure. So the half-ellipse for the monopole is actually rotated 
360 degrees about the vertical axis of the antenna.
The size of either the dipole or monopole is related to wavelength, and we 
find numerous examples of both scaled to the respective frequency. So monopoles 
at 10 MHz and 10 GHz are 7.5m and 0.75 cm, respectively. Both types of anten­
nas produce linear polarization in the direction of the conductor. The monopole is 
popular as the microwave waveguide transition element to allow electrical signals 
to be converted to electromagnetic waves. It is the main component of the common 
coax-to-waveguide adaptor.
To obtain circular polarization, we need to add a second conductor at right 
angles and with the same signal either delayed or advanced in phase by 90 degrees. 
Such elemental antennas are illustrated in Figure 2.11 [6]. At the top are patch 
antennas of the type used to receive from GPS satellites and in two-way mobile 
satellite communications. The crossed dipole at (C) and drooping dipoles at (D), re­
spectively, work in the manner just described. Finally, the quadrafilar helix antenna

provides near-uniform radiation across a hemisphere to provide coverage of the 
entire sky from a location on the ground. All of these antennas could be categorized 
as omnidirectional for areas above the ground.
One limitation of all of these antennas is their bandwidth, which is centered on 
the frequency corresponding to resonance of the dipole or monopole, respectively. 
The discone is a type of omnidirectional antenna (radiating in the same shape as the 
monopole, i.e., a donut) that is capable of very broad bandwidth (Figure 2.12). It is 
fed with coax at the center top and provides a bandwidth of 10% of the resonant 
frequency. Each of the tilted spokes is approximately 0.7 wavelength, making its 
dimension 21m and 2.1 cm at 10 MHz and 10 GHz, respectively. A ground plane 
is not necessary and the antenna can be placed at any height.
The general property of nondirectional antennas is that they cannot discrimi­
nate RFI from the desired signal. They also cannot support frequency reuse based 
on direction, an important requirement in land mobile as well as satellite applica­
tions. Still, there is an important place for them because of their compactness and 
ease of use.
2.3.2  Waveguide Horns
Waveguide horns derive from the principle of the open-ended waveguide, which 
radiates in a directional pattern away from the opening and with the same polariza­
tion that exists inside the guide. Most waveguides are either rectangular with the 
ability to covey a single linear polarization, square or circular with dual linear or

circular polarization, or elliptical used where physical flexibility is needed. Figure 
2.13 presents a variety of feed horn designs, each with their respective characteris­
tics and benefits [5].
The flared horn in (A) maintains the same ratio of dimensions to maintain its 
vertical polarization and minimize the conversion to higher order modes from the 
fundamental mode in the waveguide section. The opening is optimized for gain and 
to match the impedance of free space (377 ohms). In (B) and (C), only one dimen­
sion is expanded to produce the appropriate pattern and impedance. The E-plane 
horn maintains polarization purity due to the constrained width while the H-plane 
horn offers control of pattern but presents the issue of moding. The square horn in 
(D) could be used for dual-linear or circular polarization; however, this particular 
example starts with rectangular waveguide and uses the transition elements to con­
nect to the square opening. It is conceivable that a polarizer can be installed in the 
transition to convert from linear to circular. Conical horns at (E) and (F) are useful 
where dual linear or circular polarization is employed. The stepped transition in 
(F) provides an impedance transformer; on receive, it can also restrict the frequency 
to a higher value in the waveguide. The corrugated horn, shown at (G), has the 
features of a conical horn but the interior contains circular ridges or rings (shown 
in cross-section). These are applied to space communications and radio astronomy 
as the feed element of reflector antennas (discussed below). This is because of their 
pattern symmetry, low cross-polarization and sidelobes, and higher efficiency.

Horn antennas can be used as the primary antenna in certain applications. 
One example is line-of-sight microwave systems engineered for transcontinental 
communications through multiple hops. Another is for testing as a standard gain 
antenna and for RFI searches.
2.3.3  Directional Antennas
The benefits of directional antennas in terms of high gain and interference sup­
pression are well known and there are many options, based upon the frequency 
of use, the link requirements, and issues related to physical restraints such as the 
need for mobility or low profile. The basic radiation properties of a directional an­
tenna are shown in Figure 2.14 and can be represented in the spherical coordinate 
system used to evaluate antenna performance; it is different from the presentation 
of antenna patterns for link design. Yet, all of the information is presented in this 
diagram. Shown are the major (main) lobe, pointed in the z direction, along with 
minor (side) lobes that represent energy lost from the major lobe and which allow 
paths for RFI into and out of the antenna. The x and y directions present the plane 
perpendicular to the direction of primary radiation, z. The area element, dA, is used 
when integrating antenna properties and varies with direction of calculation along 
the three axes.

The numerator is simply the relative power in the maximum direction, and the 
denominator is the integrated area of a cross-section of the pattern, for example, 
along the y-z axis. Once the pattern is known, the peak gain can be estimated using 
this technique, called pattern integration [7].
It is common practice to prepare antenna radiation patterns in two dimensions 
to simplify their application in link studies. Figure 2.15 presents four common pre­
sentations of antenna radiation pattern data, each derived from the common source 
such as Figure 2.14. Antenna measurements are a difficult process and so only a 
portion of the pattern is actually measured. Generally speaking, we are interested 
in the maximum, or peak, gain value and the level of the sidelobes that contribute 
to RFI. Cross-polarization performance is important as well, but this is usually 
taken separately. The polar plot in (A) and the rectangular plot in (B) are popular 
as they provide a clear representation of the major lobe and sidelobes. These are 
shown as relative directivity where peak gain is 0 dB and all other values are nega­
tive in dB. More commonly, the peak gain is some positive value determined by the 
aperture of the antenna, its frequency of operation, and various losses. The contour 
plot in (C) is useful mainly in satellite antenna radiation patterns, indicating how 
well the satellite “footprint” covers an area of interest. Last, the three-dimensional 
plot in (D) provides quantitative data on the entire coverage of the antenna but is 
challenging to obtain and apply in given situations.
These principles apply to all directional antennas because they perform by re­
directing energy as required and yet will allow some degree of undesired radiation 
through sidelobes and the like. Side and back lobe levels are usually specified by 
a mask that defines the maximum allowable gain in every direction. For example, 
suppose that we were to specify -20 dB as the maximum allowable sidelobe level 
in (B) of Figure 2.15. That can just about be met although the design would likely 
need to be modified to satisfy the -20 dB. On the other hand, we see that the ac­
tual gain in the sidelobe region is typically below -20 dB and in fact has nulls at 
particular angles.
2.3.4  Multiple Element (Yagi-Uda Array)
The Yagi-Uda array is a simple antenna employing the dipole as a radiating ele­
ment and one or more additional linear elements that redirect energy in the desired 

2.3  Antennas in Radiocommunication Services 
35
direction. Figure 2.16 shows the relationship of these elements and Figure 2.17 is 
a typical radiation pattern in polar form. The additional elements are termed para­
sitic elements since they intercept energy from the radiating element and re-radiate 
it in a constructive manner. Aside from the horn, it is one of the basic forms of direc­
tional antenna design. It is prominent at frequencies below about 100 MHz because 
of its simplicity; however, it is still useful up to about 2 GHz where it is compact and 
relatively inexpensive to construct.
The log-periodic array is a variant of the Yagi which contains many linear ele­
ments all fed with power. The elements have spacing and lengths that vary according 
to a logarithmic progression, producing an antenna with a very wide bandwidth.
2.3.5  Reflector Aperture (Dish Antenna)
The reflector aperture is composed of a radiating element chosen for the particular 
frequency band and transmission line and a reflector surface used to redirect the 
incoming wave to or from the radiating element. In actuality, the reflector surface 
is like the parasitic elements of the yagi—the fields produced by the feed induce 
incremental currents on the reflector surface, and these re-radiate the energy along

applications.

a planar wavefront in the forward direction. A familiar form is the parabolic reflec­
tor and feed, generally known as the dish. Its first applications were in radio as­
tronomy, line-of- sight microwave systems and space communications. An example 
of a classic parabolic reflector antenna is provided in Figure 2.18.
The geometry of the most basic parabolic reflector system is called the prime-
focus fed design, illustrated in Figure 2.19. The feed is located at the focus of the 
paraboloidal surface, F, and all points of reflection, P, produce parallel rays, P – A. 
The focal length, O – F, divided by the diameter, D, determines how concave the 
surface will be and has secondary impact on beam characteristics. This places the 
feed at the center of the path from the reflector where it produces blockage and 
scattering of energy. The dish antenna is the most popular in use at microwave fre­
quencies, particularly because of its relatively low cost for the gain produced. The 
dish is exploited in a number of configurations, with three common examples being 
shown in Figure 2.20. In the prime-focus fed parabolic reflector system, discussed 
above and shown at the left, we see that most of the energy is directed properly 
along a parallel wavefront. However, there may be spillover at the edge of the 
reflector, which happens when the feed illumination is not zero at the edge of the 
reflector. In addition, there is blockage by the feed which also causes scattering 
due to diffraction. In the offset feed design to its right, the feed is moved below the 
direction of radiation so that there is no blockage or scattering. On the other hand,

the beam is skewed from its most desirable orientation, producing a defocusing of 
the beam. This has the effect of reducing gain as compared to the center fed design. 
There is a tradeoff between defocusing and feed blockage, with the optimum choice 
being a result of the interaction of these factors. The folded optics design on the 
far right solves the mechanical problem of feed location, allowing all electronics as 
well as the feed to be placed behind the reflector. The reflector of the Cassegrain 
approach is hyperbolic (convex), as illustrated to the right of Figure 2.20 and in 
Figure 2.18. Another equally popular folded-optics feed design is the Gregorian, 
which uses a concave subreflector located further from the reflector and causing a 
crossing of the beam along the axis of the antenna. Both folded optic designs can 
be optimized for the best performance through fine tuning of feed and subreflector, 
and adding absorptive material around the subreflector to reduce sidelobes. This is 
discussed further below.

The Radiocommunication System in an Interference-Limited Environment
The radiation characteristic of a reflector antenna is generally analogous to 
the sin(u)/u property, shown in Figure 2.21. The main beam contains most of the 
energy and produces a beamwidth measured at the 3 dB points. According to the 
relationship just mentioned, the first sidelobe is approximately 14 dB down from 
the peak of the main beam. This offers the greatest potential for RFI other than 
what might occur in the main beam itself. The upper diagram illustrates how this 
pattern appears for a cross section along the vertical or horizontal axis, looking at 
the energy in the same polarization as the antenna itself. Cross-polarized energy 
(the dotted line) is essentially zero due to the symmetry of the reflector. When we 
take the cross-section at 45 degrees (shown to the lower right), the pattern in the 
same polarization again takes the shape of sin(u)/u but the cross polarized pattern 
is no longer zero (the dotted pattern). Rather, it has a null at the center of the main

beam and produces sidelobes comparable in level to the co-polarized case but in­
terleaving across the angular range.
One of the primary means of reducing sidelobe levels in reflector antennas 
is through optimization of the pattern illumination of the reflector by the feed. 
One ideal form is presented at the top of Figure 2.22: uniform illumination that 
produces a constant level of radiation on the entire reflector surface. Through the 
Fourier transform, the primary radiation pattern produces a secondary pattern in 
the far field which, in this case, is determined by

The first sidelobe is approximately 13.2 dB down from the main beam and the 
half-power beamwidth follows a relationship

While the sidelobe level is relatively high, the directivity gain factor is optimal 
at 1. This means that from the standpoint of antenna efficiency, uniform illumina­
tion is best. On the other hand, sidelobe performance is the poorest. This is seen 
by looking down the listing of alternative illumination patterns, to see a progress 
to lower sidelobes while efficiency decreases as well. We can obtain the lowest sid­
elobe at -32 dB at the point of poorest efficiency, 0.67. The tradeoff is therefore 
clear—if low sidelobes are needed, we may design the antenna with a correspond­
ingly larger dimension to compensate for lost gain. The mainbeam beamwidth 
increases as we progress down the chart, but this too can be compensated with 
increased dimension.
The beamwidth relationship also comes into play if the reflector is oval or rect­
angular in shape. What happens is that the beamdwidth is determined by diameter 
of the reflector in the corresponding plane. Thus, if the reflector is rectangular and 
oriented horizontally, then the resulting beam is nearly rectangular, but oriented 
vertically. 
2.3.6  Array of Elements (Flat-Panel Array)
Individual elements can be assembled into an array to achieve high gain and re­
duced sidelobes. The patch antenna introduced in Figure 2.11 (A) is a common 
element of the array, especially as dimensions get smaller due to higher frequency 
of operation (i.e., at 1 GHz and above). For example, Figure 2.23 presents an array

of patch elements in microstrip that is provided with appropriate power distribu­
tion. This arrangement would provide a fixed beam perpendicular to the page, 
with vertical (in the plane of the page) linear polarization, based on how power is 
introduced to each element. Often referred to as a planar array, it can be produced 
in a thin package that simplifies mounting and pointing.
An example of a commercially produced planar array is shown in Figure 2.24, 
which is applied to a mobile wireless base station operating in two bands. This an­
tenna would provide 90 degrees of horizontal coverage; thus, four antennas would 
cover the full 360 degrees around a base station tower. It can be used in either ver­
tical or horizontal polarization. The gain in a direction opposite to the peak (i.e., 
the back lobes) is down approximately 25 dB, indicating its ability to suppress RFI. 
The lower radiation patterns present the beam along the vertical plane to indicate 
that its primary direction is horizontal. Other angles of elevation can be obtained 
by tilting the antenna.
2.3.7  Phased Array
A phased array is a collection of antenna elements whose phasing can be varied in 
such a manner that the beam can be pointed electrically rather than physically. This 
principle is illustrated in Figure 2.25 (A), which presents four elements each con­
nected through phase shifters. The direction of the beam, Y, is established at angles 
θ and φ by the phase progression across the elements. The array can be scanned

to any angle and the pattern is little changed except for translation [8]. Four such 
arrays are combined in (B) to achieve a two-dimensional array.
The performance of a seven-element linear array with half-wavelength (λ/2) 
and full wavelength (λ) spacing is given in Figure 2.26 (C) and (D), respectively [9]. 
All elements are driven in-phase in both examples and the main-beam is directed 
toward zero degrees of azimuth. Note the reasonable sidelobe performance for λ/2 
spacing and the extremely high grating lobe at ±80° for λ spacing.
The direction of pointing can be changed by introducing a phase progression 
across the elements of 30°. In other words, the first element on the right is at 0°, 
the next at 30°, the next at 60°, and so on. As a result, the main beam steers to the 
left by approximately 10°. This angle can be computed from

sion. The resulting pattern in Figure 2.27 has a noticeable asymmetry about it with 
some sidelobes increasing and others decreasing.

Phased arrays are useful for interference rejection as well as beam pointing. In 
fact, both can be accomplished at the same time provided that a number of con­
ditions are met. Generally speaking, cancellation works best outside of the main 
beam where it is less likely to reduce the power of the desired signal. This is illus­
trated in Figure 2.28 for a small array (six in-line elements). The quiescent pattern 
represents the array performance when aligned with the desired direction and no 
cancellation in action. The cancellation pattern is that which the array provides 
with appropriate amplitude and phase coefficients. Finally, the synthesized pattern 
shows the null that is produced in the direction of the interfering signal. Key to the 
operation of this array is knowing the direction to the interference. In the absence 
of this, it is still possible to introduce a processor that can dynamically adjust the 
weightings to produce the null. However, this only works under a number of stan­
dard conditions. More will be said about interference cancellation in Chapters 8 
and 9.
2.3.8  Integrating RF Electronics with the Antenna
The synergy between transmitter and receiver with antennas has been demonstrated 
in radar and broadband satellite communications. Generally based on the phased 
array, each antenna element is fitted with its own amplifier or pair of amplifiers 
(a low-noise amplifier (LNA) and a power amplifier (PA). Figure 2.29 illustrates 
an example of horns as transmit elements; a corresponding amplifier would be 
placed immediately behind each horn to reduce losses and simplify alignment. In 
the Spaceway broadband satellite, the array consists of 1,500 horn elements with 
amplifiers, and is used to create a cellular beam pattern over the continental United 
States. This type of integration provides the benefit of reducing the power required 
per element so that a given beam is generated by the sum of powers through the

principle of the phased array. The beams can be created dynamically and there is 
the potential to introduce beam nulling to reduce RFI on receive or transmit. The

Key Concepts for Evaluating RFI
Operation in radiocommunication is similar to other telecommunications transmis­
sion techniques in that there is a sending end and a receiving end. Unlike fiber-optic 
links, which maintain near-complete isolation from the external environment, ra­
diocommunications are readily subject to disruption from electromagnetic sources. 
In this chapter, we address the specific nature of RFI disruptions, what they rep­
resent, and how they can be addressed and resolved through proper engineering. 
Some aspects are part of an exact science while others fall under the general cat­
egory of the art of radio—wherein we use proven methodologies such as EMC 
design, failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA), and troubleshooting through 
decision trees. Real-life examples play an important role in gaining an understand­
ing of RFI resolution practice; there is no substitute for good anecdotal information 
from experienced people. Nevertheless, an objective and scientific point of view 
often proves most effective when dealing with the complexity of RFI resolution.
The simple picture in Figure 2.4 makes clear that RFI comes in many forms 
that require different treatment in the planning and operation of a system. Some 
of these are easily identified when a system is conceived; others are not anticipated 
(or possibly cannot be anticipated), which complicates the steps we must take to 
address it now and in the future. We must “know the enemy” if we are to take the 
most effective and efficient steps in mitigating RFI in whatever forms it takes. Be­
low, we review different categories of electromagnetic radiation that exist within a 
system or may be contained in the external environment. They are all capable of in­
troducing RFI into the victim receiving antenna(s), both in-band and out-of-band.
3.1  Manmade RFI (Unintentional and Intentional)
Under the principle that “one operator’s interference is another’s communications,” 
we can expect that much of the RFI that we receive is a man-made condition like 
highway traffic. We discussed in Chapter 1 that spectrum must be shared and re­
used, and RFI is a natural outcome. Most of this is unintentional, meaning that 
it occurs from the internal operation of one system and is not a disruption that is 
done on purpose. An interesting example of intended disruption reported in the 
press [1] involved some hotels that were jamming Wi-Fi hotspots set up by guests. 
Devices that do this are intended to deny service and are available on the commer­
cial market. The FCC took this seriously and has fined at least one hotel chain for

doing this. That aside, we can expect that the majority of RFI is produced in nor­
mal operation and consists of the radiated signals themselves, along with spurious 
radiation of harmonics and intermodulation products. Spurious signals can look 
like communication carriers that are operating on different frequencies, but can fall 
inside our operating band due to the signals and non-linearities that produce them.
The majority of communication carriers in terrestrial and space service contain 
digital modulation transmitted continuously (or at least continuously during an 
“on” period). That applies to phase shift keying (PSK) and amplitude and phase 
shift keying (APSK) modulation and to CDMA using spread spectrum as well. 
Regarding CDMA, bandwidth is determined by the chip rate rather than the bit 
rate (i.e., applying the spreading factor). Systems that employ TDMA have a duty 
cycle ranging from under 10% during “on” periods to as much as 95%. Of course, 
it will depend if we are looking at the transmission coming from a single station 
(which is on the low end of the range) or what exists over a multiple access chan­
nel containing all users as is experienced by a satellite transponder or other type 
of radio repeater. The basic spectrum of a digital carrier is presented in Figure 
3.1 for constant data rate and modulation characteristics and assuming a symbol 
rate of unity. The parameter in this figure is the spectrum roll-off factor, α, which 
represents that amount of extra bandwidth due to the raised-cosine spectrum shap­
ing. Minimum occupied bandwidth is achieved at α equal to zero. This produces a 
perfectly rectangular spectrum with a bandwidth equal to the symbol rate, Rs, and 
a constant power spectral density in watts/Hertz that is simply the ratio
	
c

R 	
where Pc is the total carrier power in watts. Also shown are spectra for other values 
of roll-off factor between 0 and 1; however, in every case the maximum value of 
power spectral density is that computed above (which is the worst case). The total 
power, Pc, in every case is the area under the spectrum curve. This tends to simplify 
the analysis of the impact of RFI due to common carriers of this type. 
Figure 3.1  Spectrum of a digital carrier with raised-cosine spectrum shaping, for various values of 
spectrum roll-off factor, α, based on a normalized symbol rate of 1. The minimum bandwidth cor­
responds to α=0 and is equal to the symbol rate.

3.1  Manmade RFI (Unintentional and Intentional) 
49
We must consider the total RFI carrier power, Pc, if it falls entirely within the 
bandwidth of the victim carrier. In the limiting case, the bandwidth of the RFI is 
so small relative to that of the victim that it can be treated as an unmodulated 
carrier. If, on the other hand, the RFI has greater bandwidth and overlays the vic­
tim, then we employ the maximum power spectrum density of the RFI across the 
bandwidth of the victim. This has the effect of increasing the noise floor by the 
amount of power spectral density or by an equivalent noise temperature increase. 
To determine the total noise power in the victim bandwidth, take the product of the 
RFI power spectral density and the victim bandwidth. Varying the roll-off doesn’t 
change the total power of the carrier since it is represented by the area under the 
spectrum. However, the RFI will tend to overlap more as the roll-off increases even 
though its total power does not increase. The trend in radiocommunication systems 
has been for low values of roll-off (≤0.2) as this improves spectrum usage efficiency. 
As a result, spectrum shaping is more rectangular and the power spectral density 
it produces is the constant value computed above. An interesting variant is the 
North American Advanced Television Standards Committee (ATSC) digital carrier 
using residual sideband modulation (Figure 3.2), composed of a digital transmis­
sion along with an unmodulated pilot carrier [3]. Both the digital signal and the 
pilot must be considered individually when evaluating interference from an ATSC 
signal into another radiocommunication service.
Systems that employ dynamic features to change modulation and coding will 
produce and be affected by RFI in varying degrees according to the instantaneous 
condition. For example, the digital video broadcasting satellite (DVB-S2) TV broad­
cast standard that has gained acceptance in many satellite applications offers a 
wide range of modulation from quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) to 64 APSK 
and coding rates from ¼ to 9/10 [2]. This standard includes an optional feature 
called Adaptive Coding and Modulation (ACM) that permits dynamic real-time 
changes of the modulation and coding parameters in response to link conditions. 
Our discussion of protection ratio (C/I), below, demonstrates that impact of circuit 
quality (e.g., BER) will depend on these parameters and time-based statistics. A

helpful aspect of ACM as provided through DVB-S2 satellite networks is that their 
symbol rate is held constant (i.e,, constant bandwidth and power spectral density).
3.2  RF Intermodulation and Harmonics
We depart from a discussion of RFI from real carriers to the consideration of sig­
nals that can be created or introduced through some type of nonlinear or abnormal 
operation. Generally referred to as intermodulation (IM) products, they exist at 
frequencies that can be predicted based on the frequencies that generate them. The 
IM can come from either the system causing the RFI or the victim system that may 
have susceptibility beyond what the basic communications capabilities would indi­
cate. A range of such interference sources is given in Table 3.1. The last category, 
fundamental overload, is not the result of a nonlinearity in the system causing RFI 
but more a consequence of proximity and/or extremely high radiated power of the 
interfering carrier. It can reduce receiver sensitivity (“desensitization”) or produce 
IM within the receiving system.
All forms of intermodulation are the result of the interaction of two or more 
carriers on different frequencies within a non-linearity. This mechanism creates 
new frequencies in the output, each being mathematically related to those present 
at the input. The particular formulation depends on the nature of the nonlinear­
ity, as discussed next. Figure 3.3 presents this mechanism for two carriers that are 
multiplied by each other, which is a basic nonlinear mechanism.
The nonlinearity represented by the X within a circle produces the product of 
the two inputs, both of which are individual frequencies. The primary output of 
the device consists of the sum and difference frequencies, the property of a double-
balanced mixer. The absence of the input frequency, which is suppressed, is clearly 
undesirable in an amplifier and this type of device is more appropriate to the op­
eration of a modulator or frequency converter. A more general representation of 
the nonlinearity is given in [4] in the form of a limiter that compresses the signals 
as they approach a maximum or saturation level (Figure 3.4). This is typical of

amplifiers but also occurs in metallic junctions as power approaches a critical level 
to make that junction behave as a diode.
Assuming the same inputs as in Figure 3.3, the output will consist of the input 
carriers along with a third carrier at a frequency equal to the difference of the two 
input frequencies. This is illustrated in Figure 3.5 in terms of the frequency spec­
trum and the phasor diagram. Frequencies at a and b interact and produce an IM 
product at the third frequency at c. (Another IM product will appear on the upper 
side, but this nonlinearity produces less power than that of the lower sideband 
IM.) The mechanism might be better understood as the response of the nonlinear­
ity to two vectors (referred to as phasors that present the amplitude and phase of 
sinusoids)—the first being the vector produced by the large carrier and the second 
produced by the small carrier attaching itself to the tip of the first and rotating in a 
clockwise sense at the difference frequency. The nonlinearity produces the counter-
rotating dotted phasor at the difference frequency.
The characteristics for two carriers can be extended to three or more by recog­
nizing that the IM products, at a multiplicity of new frequencies, are determined 
by the arithmetic permutations shown at the top of Figure 3.6. The frequency of 
a given IM product is governed by the sum and difference of integer multiples of 
Figure 3.3  The multiplication of two carriers produces a sum and difference frequency at the out­
put. This is the principle behind the operation of an upconverter or downconverter.

the generating frequencies, where m and n are integers the sum of which indicates 
the order of the product. Thus, for m=1 and n=2, a third (3) order product exists 
at 2f1 – f2 and 2f2 – f1. The fifth (5) order products are located at 3f1 – 2f2 and 
3f2 – 2f1. As a general rule, the higher the order, the lower the power level of the 
intermodulation product, illustrated in the output at the right. This is a good thing 
since higher order products can affect more victim signals.
While the frequencies of all IM products are established by those of the signals 
generating them, the levels of these products are determined by the unique transfer 
characteristics (amplitude and phase) of the device. The data for relevant amplifiers 
are presented in empirical graphs of the type shown in Figure 3.7. Measurements 
are made with two carriers that are equal in power that are on separate frequencies 
in the amplifier passband. The 3rd order intercept point (IP3), while not physical 
and directly measurable, nevertheless can be projected from the data. More general 
properties can be determined with a single carrier measurement of both amplitude 
and relative phase shift [4].

large carrier a and a weaker carrier b, producing an IM product (dashed arrow); (A) presents the 
spectrum of the output and (B) presents the phasor relationship
Figure 3.6  IM produced by two carriers in a soft limiter characteristic. The frequency of a given 
intermodulation product is determined by the linear permutation of the carriers producing it. The 
spacing between IM products is equal to the carrier spacing (i.e., f2 – f1 = Δf).

3.2  RF Intermodulation and Harmonics 
53
Harmonics as well as IM are produced by real amplifiers not operating in their 
linear regions. This is illustrated for the simple Class A amplifier circuit in Figure 
3.8. While the ideal linear circuit will not produce unwanted products, a real-world 
device and its operation are non-linear over some range of signal input and out­
put. The figure shows a sinusoid as input and produces an amplified but distorted 
output that exhibits clipping and an unbalance of positive and negative excursions. 
The waveform is still periodic but contains the harmonics to be discussed below.
Harmonic generation is the result of a nonlinearity operating on an individual 
carrier, producing spurious frequencies at integer multiples of the fundamental fre­
quency of the carrier. It is also the principle behind the frequency multiplier circuit, 
illustrated in Figure 3.9. The pair of diodes in the frequency multiplier can be real­
ized when two dissimilar metals make contact, or at an oxidized junction of metals. 
A classic example is when rivets of a different metal than the base are located in 
the presence of high-RF power or due to a rusty bolt and nut that is exposed to a 
high electromagnetic field. A practicing EMC engineer recounted the story of RFI 
produced by a metal fence near a TV broadcasting tower that interfered with radar 
at a nearby airport [6]. Junctions of this type can produce rectification of a sinusoi­
dal carrier, thus creating the types of harmonics illustrated in Figure 3.9. The tuned 
circuit at the right of the schematic is used to select a single output frequency, but 
in its absence, the device produces a wide comb of harmonics, potentially reaching 
the microwave band.

quasilinear regions. The third and fifth order intercept points indicate the virtual location of where 
the single carrier linear characteristic intercepts the extension of graphs of the third order inter­
modulation product and fifth order intermodulation product, respectively. The absolute numerical 
values are for illustration purposes and do not represent real characteristics; however, the slope of 
the straight-line sections is correct for most solid state amplifiers.

elevated levels. In a study of potential radar interference to 4G long-term evolution

(LTE) terrestrial wireless systems in the 3.5-GHz band, the authors characterized 
the class of weather radar in the following manner [7]:
Traditional (legacy) long-range air-search radar waveforms often use pulse widths 
(PWs) that are between 1 and 10 μs long, at pulse repetition rates (PRRs) of be­
tween 300 and 1,000 pulses/sec. The transmitted waveform duty cycle (or DC, 
defined as time interval during which waveform power is transmitted divided by 
total time of the waveform’s periodicity) of such radars is about 0.1 percent. Such 
radars use tube-type output devices (e.g., magnetrons, klystrons, crossed-field am­
plifiers) that generate effective isotropic radiated peak power levels (peak EIRP) 
of 1–10 GW (90 to 100 dBW). Newer radars often use solid-state output devices 
radiating peak EIRPs of 10–100 MW (70 to 80 dBW) but at the cost of longer PWs 
and higher DCs that can approach 10%. The longer PWs of current and future 
solid state radars require, in turn, that transmitted pulses be frequency-modulated 
or phase-coded to maintain adequate range resolution.
This succinctly describes the waveform and power characteristics of a common 
radar system and provides a general framework for evaluating its effect on radio­
communication. The study in question by the National Telecommunication and 
Information Agency (NTIA) was undertaken to determine if 4G wireless networks 
could share the same 3.5-GHz spectrum as existing weather radars, which we con­
sider further in Chapter 6. 
The effect of radar can be considered according to either the time or frequency 
domains. In the time domain, the critical factor is the duty cycle discussed above. 
Owing to relatively narrow bandwidth of the victim carrier, the pulsed interference 
only passes through the demodulator filter for a limited fraction or percentage of 
the time. In the frequency domain, a pulsed waveform such as radar will affect 
other spectrum usage according to the principles of the Fourier Series and Fourier 
Transform. The Fourier Series contains harmonically related sinusoidal terms due 
to the periodic pulse waveform [8]:

The relationships of this equation are illustrated in Figure 3.10. In the first ex­
ample of radar, pulses are transmitted with a period of T seconds, which is equiva­
lent to a pulse rate of 1/T pulses per second (identified as f0 in the figure). The 
pulse width is τ seconds, so that the duty cycle is simply τ/T (not as a percentage). 
The spectrum plot indicates frequency components at odd multiples (1, 3, 5, etc.) 
of f0; further, the envelope of the spectrum has nulls at multiples of 1/ τ, defined as 
f. Summarizing this information, the location of the frequencies in the spectrum is 
defined by the pulse repetition rate and the nulls in the spectrum are defined by the 
inverse of the pulse duration. Reducing the pulse rate but not the pulse duration, in 
the second illustration, has the effect of producing more frequencies closer together, 
but the location of nulls remains the same. Finally, according to the Fourier Trans­
form of a single rectangular pulse of duration T,

the spectrum has all frequencies (the spectrum is filled in like by noise) and the nulls 
remain at the inverse of the pulse duration.
This discussion explains the basic nature of radar and other pulsed signals as 
they may produce RFI. As these are periodic in nature, the energy is distributed 
across a wide spectrum that contains components at multiples of the pulse rate. 
The effect on a victim receiver may be more complex even though the impact may 
occur only during the “on” periods of the duty cycle, as discussed in Chapter 6.
3.4  Protection Ratio and Receiver Sensitivity
Proper operation of a radiocommunication link is ensured if the received signal 
level is sufficient to meet the requirements of service quality. This can be stated in 
terms of a carrier-to-noise ratio, C/N, in the carrier bandwidth, or by a minimum 
signal power called the receiver sensitivity. The former is a relative measure while 
the latter is absolute, typically measured in dBm. The importance of the relative 
measure is that we can treat noise and interference in terms of the power values, and 
in relation to the desired carrier. Then, the carrier power in absolute terms (dBm in 
the example) can be established at the demodulator using post-amplification (i.e., 
after the pre-amplification at the antenna). The C/N analysis amounts to computing 
Figure 3.10  Spectra of pulsed waveforms; the top two illustrations present the Fourier Series repre­
sentation of the spectrum while the bottom figure is based on the Fourier Transform of a single pulse 
[9]. The latter has no discrete frequencies as the spectrum is effectively filled in with noise.

The terms on the right are called interference “entries,” which recognizes that 
they enter the victim radiocommunication system independently of each other. The 
contributors will depend on the specific system design, but generally consist of 
thermal noise, internal interference, external interference, intermodulation, and 
possibly others. Each of the terms on the right side of the equation is the inverted 
value of carrier to noise or interference and can be understood as a normalized 
noise or interference contribution (normalized in terms of the carrier power). We 
treat noise and interference as independent Gaussian random variables; for Gauss­
ian noise, the variance is the noise power. Hence, we can add powers to obtain the 
total.
We discussed how RFI from radar is pulsed with a certain duty cycle and that 
it is not like Gaussian noise. On the other hand, it can have a noise-like effect when 
it passes through the receiver bandwidth. This effectively adds another entry in the 
above equation to correspond to the “on” time of the entry.
3.4.1  How to Determine Receiver Threshold
In a real system, the designer must establish each interference entry and be able 
to state what the absolute value of total noise exists at the receiver. Knowing the 
required C/N permits the designer to then calculate the minimum needed value of 
C, which is the receiver threshold. To reinforce the meaning of this, the receiver 
threshold power, usually in dBm, must consider all sources of noise and interfer­
ence, not just the thermal noise. Table 3.2 presents an example of the calculation 
of receiver threshold for a system with the RFI terms identified above. As this is a 
terrestrial line-of-sight path over smooth earth, we assume a fading loss allocation 
of 16 dB to allow for Ricean fading and absorption by foliage. Propagation effects 
are considered in detail in Chapter 5. The thermal noise power is calculated from 
the system noise temperature and carrier bandwidth from the basic equation,

We can see the impact of increasing external RFI by making the carrier-to-
interference (C/I)  external entry into an independent variable and computing the 
resulting C/N total (noise plus all sources of interference). This is given in Figure 
3.11 for a constant received power level and varying the assumed external C/I from 
a high initial value of 34 dB to the extremely low value of 0 dB (i.e., the total power 
of noise plus interference equals the carrier power). Under the former condition, 
external RFI is negligible (the right-hand side of the curve); but as we increase ex­

58 
�������������������������������
Key Concepts for Evaluating RFI
ternal interference, the overall link first is unaffected until the external C/I reaches 
approximately 20 dB (i.e., an increase in its level of 14 dB).
We next examine how external RFI can be mitigated through an increase in 
receiver threshold. This is presented in Table 3.3 for the same link assumed in Table 
3.2 and Figure 3.11, with a column added that reflects an increase in external RFI 
of 17.5 dB (corresponding to a decrease in the C/I of the same amount). In order to 
maintain an overall C/N at the demodulator of 14.4 dB (the bottom line in Table 
3.3), the receiver threshold must increase by 9 dB. This is seen in two places in 
Table 3.3: the transmitted power increases from 3 dBW to 12 dBW (i.e., from 2 to 
16 watts) and the resulting received carrier power increases from approximately 
–80 dBm to –71 dBm. We see that the combining of different ratios of carrier power 
to noise or interference power has a softening effect in that the overall link is not 
affected in equal proportion to the rise in the interference itself. However, there is 
still a substantial impact on receiver sensitivity that nevertheless must be taken into 
account.
This example includes an external RFI entry from an unspecified source. It 
could be from a neighboring radiocommunication system that is considered during 
the development of the victim system. Alternatively, it could appear in the future, 
in which case the characteristics of the victim system (e.g., the receiver threshold)

may need modification. In many practical situations, the transmitter of the victim 
system is boosted in power when the RFI appears. This may be impractical if the 
power is already at a maximum for reasons related to the design of this particular 
link or system. The course of action will generally follow a process similar to what 
we discuss in Chapter 8.
3.4.2  Receiver Desensitization
The previous section dealt with receiver threshold, which is the received power that 
sufficiently exceeds the noise and interference to achieve satisfactory link perfor­
mance. Under these conditions, the interference that is present is comparable to the 
noise and need only be treated as added noise in the receiver. Within the receiver 
itself, the RF and IF amplifiers and demodulator circuit are operating within their 
respective linear ranges and perform according to specification. This may require 
either an increase or decrease in gain ahead of the demodulator; however, the C/N 
will not be affected as the overall noise figure is determined at the first stage of 
amplification. The RF entry point to the receiving system is likely to have signifi­
cantly more bandwidth than that of the desired carrier and as a result strong signals 
including other carriers and RFI can affect the operating condition and linearity of 
amplifiers in the receive chain. The threat posed by the transmitted signal of the re­
ceiving station in question can be addressed through proper filtering and duplexing 
at the antenna, or by the use of separate antennas for transmit and receive. Signals 
of substantial strength can be emitted close by especially in the case of base station 
towers and teleport Earth stations. As one moves the out-of-band RFI generator 
farther away, the threat decreases to the point where normal filtering in the receive 
chain provides adequate protection from overload.

ternal; C/N thermal without RFI is constant at 16.1 dB, per link budget in Table 3.2.

�������������������������������
Key Concepts for Evaluating RFI
The basic mechanism for receiver desensitization and overload can be under­
stood from Figure 3.7, which shows the input/output characteristic of a typical 
solid state RF amplifier. The top curve applies to each of two equal carriers in the 
amplifier, displaying saturation at the maximum power output. When the output 
reaches saturation, there is no more power to be added and the amplifier acts as 
a limiter. Intermodulation products rise to a maximum as well. For unequal input 
carriers, the strong carrier dominates and will drive down the weaker carrier as the 
former reaches saturation. Reception of the weaker carrier is thus degraded and 
can force it below threshold in the demodulator. This suppression is in the range of 
5 to 10 dB, depending on whether the strong signal is unmodulated or modulated 
over some particular bandwidth [4].
An undesired strong carrier can be addressed once it is identified and its source 
located. Techniques for this are discussed in Chapter 8. The primary approach is 
to suppress this signal at the input to the receiving station, probably between the 
antenna and the first active stage. It may also be possible to shield the antenna 
from the interference if the direction is known and the shielding applied in an ef­
fective way. It may even be possible to use signal cancellation through the antenna 
(discussed in Chapter 8).

As a final note, interference analysis contains many assumptions about both 
the RFI and the victim system. The pessimism in some of these makes for a con­
servative prediction of overall C/N and its impact on service performance. On the 
other hand, we cannot know everything about system operation or of RFI sources 
that might change or appear in the future. So, some conservatism is a good thing 
as it can compensate for unknowns. There is also the danger of overdesigning to 
the point that feasibility comes into question along with how much it might cost 
to deliver the capability. More options and methodologies are presented in the fol­
lowing chapters to provide the reader with some tools and ideas that help with this 
fluid process.

Link Properties Under Free Space 
Conditions
Free-space radio-wave propagation was introduced previously as a mechanism that 
influences all forms of radio communication, for both the desired and interfering 
signals. The first part of this chapter reviews a free space path without atmosphere. 
This is followed by consideration of the impact of the ionosphere on frequencies 
below about 100 MHz and the troposphere on higher frequencies. This purpose of 
this discussion is to provide a framework for transmission of desired and undesired 
signals and is not a detailed examination of radiocommunication system design. 
However, we reference a number of good resources that can fill in detail that may 
be of interest to the reader on furthering the examination of RFI introduced into 
the receiving system.
We use algebra to express the relationship of this basic form of transmission 
because the calculation of path loss is both very accurate and straightforward. The 
general principle is that signal power decreases as the square of the distance, or in 
the form of an inverse square low:
	
2
t
r
P
P
R
∝
	
where Pr is the received power as measured at the distant end, Pt is the transmitted 
power in terms of the EIRP, and R is the range. The same relationship applies to the 
RFI as well. This can be expressed as an equation rather than a proportionality by 
taking into account the gain of the receiving antenna and the frequency or wave­
length. The range equation (also called Frii’s transmission equation wherein EIRP 
is substituted by the equivalent transmit power times transmit gain) is most often 
used to identify important factors in line-of-sight propagation:

where Gr is the gain of the receive antenna and λ is the wavelength. This can be 
expressed in terms of a loss factor in the denominator by inverting the bracketed

This equation is strictly accurate for computing the free space loss in dB and 
the received power (at the antenna) in dBW, based on a line of sight path where 
the only loss is due to “spreading” of the signal as it propagates out from the 
transmitting antenna. It is figured in the direction of the receiving antenna and 
thus includes the gain of the transmitting antenna as part of the EIRP (see further 
discussion in Section 4.2.1). Atmospheric losses, fading, blockage and other im­
pairments to the radio signal are not included but will be introduced as additional 
losses in the calculation of Pr. This is the process that was employed in Chapter 
3 in Tables 3.2 and 3.3. The range equation is plotted in Figure 4.1 with range as 
an independent variable and frequency as a parameter for 100 MHz, 1 GHz, and 
10 GHz. Owing to the square law relationship versus frequency, the curves are 
20 dB apart. For example, each doubling of range increases the free space loss by 
6 dB (owing to the squaring of frequency in the range equation) and likewise for 
frequency. In the past, engineers have used specialized slide rules that take account 
of different antenna design factors and unique aspects of the particular radiocom­
munication system. However, it is most convenient to use software for the personal 
computer to compute losses for complex paths over variable Earth topography and 
on Earth-to-space paths through the atmosphere. Lacking this, the analyst can still 
use Microsoft Excel or a math package like MatLab with the equations and data in 
this and the following chapters. Calculation of C/I, reviewed in Chapter 3, involves 
two separate path calculations: one for the desired carrier, C, and the other for each 
interference entry, I.
4.1  Path Geometries
The previous discussion and analysis was for a line-of-sight path in free space and 
in a vacuum. As such, there is nothing to alter the pure electromagnetic field of 
the wave as it leaves the transmitting antenna, propagates through space over a

distance and is converted back into an electrical signal in the receiving antenna. The 
next order of business is to establish realistic conditions for the ground and other 
potential obstacles under which free-space propagation over the Earth is essentially 
achieved. This brings in the concept of the Fresnel Zone [1], which is an ellipse ex­
tending between transmitting and receiving antennas that is the locus of a total path 
length that is half a wavelength longer than the line-of-sight path. As such, a wave 
that reflects off of a point on this ellipse arrives at the receiving antenna exactly in 
the opposite phase (i.e., delayed by 180°). The dotted lines in Figure 2 represent 
such a path. The radius of the first Fresnel Zone, r, is given by

d d
r
D
λ
=
	
where D is the direct line-of-sight path length, and d2 and d1 are the distances from 
transmit and receiving antennas, respectively, to a particular  point on this ellipse. 
This is illustrated in Figure 4.2; the broken line segments, TP and PR, sum to be 
the path length, D, plus a half wavelength, λ/2. In principle, a reflected wave will 
cancel the direct wave if received at R with equal intensity. This would only happen 
in practice when the transmitting and receiving antennas have the same gain along 
these two paths and there is perfect reflection at the first Fresnel Zone. In practice, 
the first Fresnel Zone is a generally accepted zone of required clearance to obtain 
an effective line-of-sight path with no loss due to blockage. Reflection can still be 
an issue and can introduce constant or time-varying fading.
In the following sections, we identify three unique types of paths encountered 
in radiocommunication: ground-to-ground, air-to-air, and space-to-ground (space-
to-space is considered as well). Within each, we find a range of possibilities that 
provide for an environment that facilitates propagation for the desired signal as 
well as potentially interfering signals. Unguided electromagnetic waves can be

treated independently of each other owing to linear properties of vacuum, air and 
any passive medium the waves encounter. This is different from the types of nonlin­
earities in amplifiers and other devices that were discussed in Chapter 3.
4.1.1  Ground to Ground
The vast majority of radiocommunication systems offer ground-to-ground com­
munications and likewise have the potential to introduce and receive RFI from 
others of similar and different characteristics. The propagation and link analysis 
starts with free-space and adds several other mechanisms for desired and undesired 
frequencies; either or both can vary with time, location and frequency band. We 
need to consider the full spectrum of radiocommunication: 100 kHz on the low end 
to 100 GHz on the high end.
The primary modes of ground-to-ground propagation, for both desired and 
interfering carriers, are illustrated in Figure 4.3 [2]. We use the traditional “adjec­
tival” band designations: medium frequency (MF), high frequency (HF), very-high 
frequency (VHF), ultra-high frequency (UHF), super-high frequency (SHF), and ex­
tremely high frequency (EHF), which extend from 300 kHz to 30 GHz in decades. 
Frequencies below 30 MHz are for narrowband applications with less than 100 
kHz of bandwidth.  In the medium frequencies (MF, 300 kHz to 3 MHz), waves 
can follow the curvature of the earth through a form of conduction that produces 
the surface wave (also called ground wave) illustrated along the Earth. The dis­
tances involved are dependent on the frequency and ground conductivity but are 
generally less than 100 km. The upper end of MF and the full range of HF can ex­
perience sky-wave propagation through reflection by the ionosphere, the charged 
layers above 100 km produced by ionization by the sun’s ultraviolet radiation and 
solar wind. 
As shown in Figure 4.3, sky wave establishes links that extend across national 
borders and continents, having the ability to bring desired signals and RFI long 
distances into the receiving antenna. The angle at which a radio wave will achieve 
total reflection is governed by the following relationship [3], maximum usable fre­
quency (MUF), which is the highest frequency that allows communication over a 
specific point-to-point path, is equal to:

where fc = the critical frequency at the time of the communications (the lowest fre­

up α = 90° and sin(α) = 1. In this case, MUF = fc, as it should.
As the angle α decreases, the value of sin(α) becomes smaller (less than 1), 
causing the MUF to be greater than fc. This is an approximation that is useful to 
obtain an idea of the relationship and actual data will differ, based on ionospheric 
conditions at the time. Under these assumptions, and for the flat earth, the distance 
that can be achieved at a given value of MUF becomes:

Link Properties Under Free Space Conditions
This is illustrated in Figure 4.4 where the F-layer is the predominant layer of 
the ionosphere at an altitude of approximately 200 km and f3 is the MUF yielding 
the longest possible path. 
The ability of the ionosphere to produce skywave is influenced greatly by solar 
activity, measured by the number of sun spots. These exhibit an 11-year cycle that 
have peaks that vary due to changes in overall solar activity, as illustrated in Figure 
4.5. Sun spots and other solar activity increases the electron count in the iono­
sphere, which in turn helps skywave propagation. However, the immediate impact 
of a solar event such as a coronal mass ejection, composed of gas and magnetic 
flux, overpowers the ionosphere and can produce a short-term radio blackout.
Use of the HF portion of the spectrum is almost always associated with sky­
wave propagation as it provides beyond line-of-sight communications. The excep­
tion is a very short-range mode called Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS), 
which provides a straight up-and-down path due to reflection off of the ionosphere 
for frequencies below approximately 10 MHz. In Figure 4.4, this corresponds to 
Station A and Station B being in close proximity. NVIS is consistent during day­
light hours when conditions establish the “critical frequency,” fc, for mirror-like 
reflection. Skywave propagation is less likely as one goes above 100 MHz, giving 
confidence that RFI will not reach the receiving point except by ground paths. 
Originally a service based on manually controlled transmitters and receivers, HF 
skywave is simplified by automated systems that identify the best usable frequency 
and automatically establish and reestablish the link. This overcomes some of the 
variability and RFI characteristics that are encountered on a day-to-day basis. Of 
course, the better approach for services with greater bandwidths and the need for 
high availability is to employ frequencies in the UHF range and above that offer 
line-of-sight propagation using the direct wave in Figure 4.3.
Our focus in ground-to-ground radiocommunication is on paths through the 
troposphere in the direct wave mode of propagation. This is actually not true line-
of-sight because the layered atmosphere acts like a lens to bend radiowaves toward 
Earth. There is a variation in refractive index of air as density decreases as one 
moves from lower to higher altitude, matching the decrease in temperature over the 
Figure 4.4  The MUF, f3, is the highest HF that can be used on a particular point-to-point path on 
Earth [3].

same range. In still air, the refractive index will vary smoothly; or with turbulence, 
the variation will be irregular so as to cause a change in the path of propagation. 
See Section 4.2.5 for a discussion of tropospheric scatter, which relies on these ir­
regularities to cause a radio wave to extend beyond the horizon. The general basis 
is for the smooth variation, resulting in a bending of the wave toward the earth. 
Standard variation in refractive index of the troposphere is suggested by the fol­
lowing relationship [5]:

Engineering studies usually don’t need to go into depth on this matter and 
refraction is taken into account with the assumption of 4/3 Earth curvature. This 
is shown graphically in Figure 4.6 and can be approximated with the quadratic 
relationship:

where h is the downward drop from a flat plane at a distance d (including refrac­
tion), k is the curvature correction factor (i.e., 4/3), and R is radius of Earth (i.e., 
6400 km).
A special condition called a temperature inversion occurs when a higher layer 
is at a higher temperature than a lower layer. This can produce ducting, which is a 
phenomenon whereby the signal follows Earth like a surface wave but in the VHF 
to SHF range (30 MHz to 30 GHz). A path length of over 2,000 km has been dem­
onstrated over water at 144 MHz and 10 GHz [6], [7]. The paths at 10 GHz are 
shown in Figure 4.7. This suggests that RFI can occur from very distant transmit­
ters, particularly for an over-the-water path. The same can be said for tropospheric 
scatter, discussed in Section 4.2.5.
Terrestrial mobile wireless propagation can be complex owing to the wide vari­
ety of user conditions. We first examine how open, non-urban, conditions influence 
signal transfer. Figure 4.8 presents a direct wave along with a wave that is reflected 
Figure 4.6  Illustration of the how typical tropospheric refraction yields an effective curvature of 
4/3 earth radius. What was supposed to be a path blocked by the earth (solid lines) turns out to 
provide a direct wave without blockage (dotted lines). In this illustration, h corresponds to true earth 
curvature (k = 1).
Figure 4.7  The map shows the paths covered on 10 GHz in tests that took place in July 2010, 
achieving a maximum range of 2,696 km [7].

by the ground to introduce a potentially interfering signal at the receiver. The lon­
ger path length of the reflected wave will result in a time delay and, equivalently, 
a difference of phase with the direct wave. Being the same carrier, the two will 
combine on a vector basis at the receive antenna and produce either enhancement 
or cancellation. There will be a loss of energy at the point of reflection as it will be 
on the ground with less than ideal reflection properties. A representative loss is 10 
dB, also called the K-factor. Another factor is the antenna radiation pattern in the 
direct versus the reflected directions; both the transmitting and receiving antennas 
must be considered when evaluating the relative signal strength of the reflected 
wave.
A final point is that the rounding of Earth itself (and without the influence of 
atmosphere) will produce a degree of diffraction or bending, allowing some energy 
to extend beyond the horizon. Referred to as “smooth Earth” diffraction, it is in 
addition to the effect of refraction in air with 4/3 earth radius. We will discuss the 
mechanism of diffraction in Chapter 5.
Ground-to-ground radiocommunication is most popular for mobile wireless 
networks, including cellular 3G and 4G. The base station antennas are arranged 
in such a manner as to match height to the size of the respective cell being served. 
A high tower as in Figure 4.8 creates a “macro-cell” with a radius of as much as 
50 km, while microcells that are important in suburban and urban areas are much 
smaller and allow greater frequency reuse across territory. The operator designs the 
network to control the RFI from their distant towers that repeat the particular seg­
ment of spectrum. The spectrum of different operators, however, is segmented so 
that there is no potential inter-operator RFI. This works as long as propagation 
phenomena and intervening terrain maintain isolation between metropolitan areas 
where the same spectrum might be reused. More will be said about this in Chapter 8.
4.1.2  Air to Ground
Air-to-ground (ATG) communication is radiocommunication between aircraft and 
stations on the ground or on water. Generally speaking, there is a line-of-sight path 
between these points and the range is from a minimum of the lowest altitude of the 
aircraft (directly overhead) to a maximum of the range extending to the horizon. 
The latter is illustrated in Figure 4.6, where the tower on the right represents the air­
craft height and the point in the center is where a ground station can still “see” the 
transmitter. The same works in the opposite direction. The principle of atmospheric 
Figure 4.8  The direct line-of-sight path can experience cancellation from a reflected multipath 
signal.

74

refraction yields an effective earth curvature of 4/3. Thus, at an altitude of 600 
meters, the range to the earth’s tangent is approximately 100 km. Consider also 
RFI paths from aircraft that are extended by ducting and smooth-earth diffraction.
The author’s experience with ATG as a radio officer in the U.S. Army is instruc­
tive as to one unique feature of having transmitters on aircraft. Aircraft are capable 
of, and frequently, change altitude. This alters the potential range and the ability to 
communicate, and RFI likewise increases with altitude. We saw this as a problem in 
that our unit employed VHF channels for ground-to-ground communications, but 
the same channels were used to communicate with helicopters. Further, the limited 
spectrum meant that the channels were used several times across extended geogra­
phy. Ground-to-ground communications worked fine without RFI from a neigh­
boring unit in a different area, but could appear when helicopters transmitted from 
the air. It is easy to see how the reuse of frequency channels was inconsistent with 
ATG, but we had little choice as we relied heavily on this dual use of radiocommu­
nication. The alternative was to restrict ATG to a subset of the channels available, 
but this would have complicated tactical operations. On the other hand, the U.S. 
Air Force has its own frequencies for ATG and air-to-air radiocommunication and 
the aforementioned problem never happened for them. The coordination issue was 
solved by having an Air Force radio operator on location who would have ATG 
communication available on non-interfering frequencies. Note also that the Army 
radios employed frequency modulation (FM) while the Air Force radios employed 
amplitude modulation (AM). This further complication was resolved years later 
by the introduction of joint radio equipment using standard digital modulation 
instead of analog modulation.
ATG radiocommunication is vital for the control of civilian airspace and most 
of these operations employ line-of-sight paths at VHF and higher frequencies. So, 
the principles just described still apply. When out of range of ground stations, air­
craft can use HF radios with capability for skywave. However, this has become a 
backup mode with the introduction of satellite communications over the Inmarsat 
and Iridium systems. Inmarsat employs geostationary satellites located over the 
major oceans, while Iridium satellites (reviewed in the next section) are in low 
Earth orbit (LEO) and cover the entire globe. From an RFI standpoint, both sys­
tems have near exclusive use of their respective portions of L-band (around 1,500 
MHz).
Another form of ATG is used by Internet service providers who offer Internet 
connectivity on commercial airplanes. GOGO, Inc., for example, has an extensive 
ATG network across North America through towers formerly used for the discon­
tinued Airphone voice telephone service. Again, they have exclusive use of their 
segment of the spectrum and have engineered their system in a manner similar to 
how cellular telephone networks operate.
4.1.3  Space to Earth
The space-to-Earth path is fundamentally line-of-sight with only the various lay­
ers of atmosphere to contend with. This was acknowledged early on when satellite 
communications was considered as an alternative to long-haul microwave systems, 
which require repeaters every 25 to 50 km, and land-based and undersea cables. 
Point-to-point satellite links with a single-hop from uplink to satellite to downlink

provide service that is essentially insensitive to distance. This basic mechanism is 
illustrated in Figure 4.9 for a geostationary satellite at 36,000 km altitude and in 
the plane of the equator. The satellite provides an area coverage beam called the 
“footprint,” where the uplink can originate from any location and the downlink 
can likewise be received at any covered location. With the altitude and equatorial 
orbit, the band of GEO satellites, numbering over 300 in total, cover the planet ex­
cept for the polar regions above about 80 degrees latitude. The illustrated footprint 
clearly covers the continental United Stations and the contours indicate constant 
levels of EIRP, in dBW in the downlink (transmit) direction from the satellite. The 
uplink footprint, which has the same shape, would have contours measured in 
either saturation flux density (SFD) in dBW/m2 or gain-to-noise temperature ratio 
(G/T) dB/K. Along with these RF characteristics, the satellite repeater usually con­
sists of dedicated RF channels that subdivide the total allocated bandwidth, such 
as 500 MHz, into “transponders” of nominally 36 MHz each. The typical block 
diagram of a repeater with transponders is shown in Figure 4.10, where there is a 
separate power amplifier for each transponder. A repeater of this type is called a 
“bent pipe” because the uplink signal is simply returned unmodified to the down­
link after frequency translation and amplification. The frequency plan in Figure 
4.11 corresponds to a 24 transponder Ku band satellite with both horizontal and 
vertical polarization. The area coverage beam acts on RFI in the same manner as 
desired signals, relaying from any uplink location to the full downlink footprint.
The majority of communications satellites in geostationary orbit are of the 
area-coverage bent-pipe variety described above. With the need to achieve greater 
bandwidth and lower cost per Mbps, several commercial satellite operators have 
introduced specialized repeaters aboard high-throughput satellites (HTS) that em­
ploy spot beams and a high quantity of point-to-point bent-pipe channels. Links 
are possible between hub earth stations and many remote VSATs to permit efficient

access to the Internet. Hub stations are restricted as to location as they must enter 
the repeater through specific beams that are not contiguous with beams serving the 
VSATs. This is shown in the coverage illustration in Figure 4.12. RFI impact here 
is limited to specific uplink and/or downlink beams, an advantage over the area 
coverage in Figure 4.9.
Either bent-pipe configuration, while being the most popular and simplest ap­
proach, has the property that the thermal noise on the uplink and downlink add on 
a power basis. This is because uplink noise is transferred through the repeater to 
the downlink along with the signal. On a spectrum analyzer connected to a down­
link ground antenna, you can see the uplink noise adding to the noise floor within 
the bandwidth of the transponder. RFI on the uplink will likewise be  transferred

vidual transponder channels.

to the downlink provided that it is within the transponder bandwidth. There is an­
other class of repeater not employing the bent-pipe within which the uplink signal 
is demodulated and reduced back to the original data. Referred to as demod-remod 
or regenerative repeater, the uplink and downlink are isolated from each other in a 
noise and interference sense.
With the launch of the Iridium system in 1998, the satellite communications 
industry saw a rebirth of non-GEO systems and a few others have since come or 
are planned. Unlike the GEO approach, low Earth orbit (LEO) and medium Earth 
orbit (MEO) systems employ moving satellites (relative to the ground), so their user 
antennas either must have broad beams or the ability to maintain pointing at the 
satellite in use. Iridium, illustrated in Figure 4.13, is a narrowband system that sup­
ports handsets for voice service and other simple terminals for low-speed data ap­
plications. By virtue of having 66 satellites in 6 near-polar orbits, the constellation 
illuminates the entire globe (and is the only system to do so). The use of L-band 
frequencies around 1.5 GHz is beneficial to propagation because it is insensitive to 
rain and allows for some diffraction and penetration of nonmetallic (e.g., wooden) 
structures. It is able to close the link because of the nature of the service and the low 
altitude of 780 km. But the link geometry is highly dynamic, ranging from as much 
as 3,000 km as the satellite rises from the horizon to as little as the altitude, which 
causes the path to experience a variety of impairments due to multipath fading, 
obstruction by buildings and vegetation, and the complexities of handoff among 
the satellite’s beams and between satellites (which incorporate intersatellite links). 
The satellites are also packet switches and perform the demod-remod approach 
as a result. The line-of-sight properties of a LEO system like Iridium exist but are 
confounded by the need to communicate through and around obstacles. 
Another non-GEO system, O3b, employs 12 MEO satellites that orbit at an 
altitude of 8,000 km in the plane of the equator. This system serves ground loca­
tions ranging approximately 8,000 km from the equator and provides Ka-band

bent-pipe capacity to tracking antennas. With at least two antennas per station, 
end users can maintain continuous service as satellites rise from and fall below the 
horizon, provided that the two locations have a view of a common satellite. Paths 
are intended to be line-of-sight as any blockage will severely impair communica­
tions. Adequate margin for rain attenuation is required due to the frequencies em­
ployed. The non-GEO concept for broadband service at Ka band was under con­
sideration at the time of this writing for direct-to-user service and in the backhaul 
segment of cellular telephones.
4.1.4  Space to Space
Space-to-space communication was pioneered by the U.S. National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration (NASA) with the introduction of the Tracking and Data 
Relay Satellite (TDRS) system. The basic arrangement of TDRS with its ground sta­
tions and user spacecraft is illustrated in Figure 4.14. Also shown is a large-diame­
ter ground antenna in the Deep Space Network (DSN) for the link to a very-distant 
planetary spacecraft. The TDRS are located in GEO orbit while most NASA users 
have LEO satellites that require relay of data and commands as they circle Earth. 
The TDRS system was introduced to reduce the number of ground-tracking anten­
nas around the world, which today are used for backup and in the DSN. Three 
frequency bands are supported: S-, Ku-, and Ka-bands. The two large dishes on 
TDRS provide point-to-point links as S- and Ka-bands and are referred to as Single 
Access (SA). These are useful for high data rates, particularly at Ka-band. On the 
front face of TDRS is a set of S-band antenna elements that form a phased array for 
the Multiple-Access (MA) service, a capability based on the use of CDMA. TDRS 
Figure 4.13  The Iridium constellation employs six near polar orbits to provide coverage of the 
entire surface of Earth. The solid lines for the ground-to-space link are at L-band (1.5 GHz) and the 
space-to-space intersatellite links are at Ka-band (20 GHz); gateway Earth stations also communicate 
with the satellite in the Ka-band. Each satellite has 48 beams over a total footprint that covers ap­
proximately 2,200 km.

also provides links to users within the atmosphere of Earth, including balloons, 
unpiloted aeronautical vehicles (UAVs), and a ground station at the South Pole.
All paths are true line-of-sight, making the service very reliable in terms of 
propagation; on the other hand, there are limits as to duration of a path due to the 
motion of user spacecraft in LEO, which make a complete orbit in approximately 
90 minutes. From an RFI perspective, TDRS is reasonably protected because the 
frequencies have received international recognition through the ITU and are dedi­
cated to NASA by the NTIA of the U.S. Government. The ground stations are 
located in fairly isolated areas like White Sands, NM, and Owens Valley, CA.
One of the more fascinating approaches used for planetary missions involves 
a relay satellite revolving about the planet in question. The repeater provides the 
path back to a ground station on Earth. Operation at the remote planet could be 
viewed as RFI free provided that the internal operation from the planet’s floor to 
the repeater is clean. From the repeater to a DSN antenna on Earth, the path is 
much the same as any deep-space mission. The dishes at DSN stations tend to be 
larger than those used in commercial communications and are treated more like ra­
dio telescopes. They tend to have lower sidelobes as well, owing to their design for 
low noise and high efficiency. These factors can mitigate RFI from the surrounding 
area.
As a final note on space-to-ground radiocommunication, the GPS system em­
ploys L-band spectrum and may be a factor in RFI studies. These satellites effec­
tively broadcast important ranging signals from MEO, and there are over a billion 
receivers throughout the planet (with some in Earth orbit as well). The system has 
dedicated spectrum but can be susceptible to out-of-band RFI at the receiving end 
of the link. Russian and European GPS systems are to be considered as well.
4.2  Line-of-Sight Propagation Characteristics in Atmosphere
We’ve looked at basic link properties for an unobstructed path and see that there 
are variations based on the locations of the terminating points. The next step is to 
consider the technical characteristics of the stations and atmospheric effects that 
introduce attenuation through absorption and scattering of RF energy. As discussed 
for refraction above, the latter property of the troposphere attenuates signals and 
allows RFI to propagate along otherwise obstructed or extended paths. These come 
into play for each of the systems discussed previously, depending on the particu­
lar link geometry and presence of absorptive or ionized media that surround our 
planet.
4.2.1  Coupling to the Antenna 
The effective radiated power is what is transmitted from the antenna in the desired 
direction. The reference for this measure is an antenna with unity gain, or 0 dBi. 
The result is the effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) that is measured in dBW 
(dB relative to 1W). Other measures, such as dBm, are often used but we must be 
sure of the reference because any value in dBm is 30 dB higher than the correspond­
ing value in dBW. Computing the EIRP is a very straightforward process, requiring 

4.2  Line-of-Sight Propagation Characteristics in Atmosphere

only a few items of information. The block diagram of a typical transmitting sta­
tion, regardless of application and how it is employed, is illustrated in Figure 4.15. 
Like most two-way communication stations, it employs a single antenna but takes 
advantage of the reciprocity of the device to combine both transmit and receive 
functions. The component that allows the transmitter (TX) and the receiver (RX) 
to connect to the antenna is referred to as a duplexer (DUP). Two forms of DUP are 
found in the variety of wireless services: frequency division duplex (FDD) and time 
division duplex (TDD). These are defined as follows [8]: 
••
FDD uses the idea that the transmission and reception of signals are achieved 
simultaneously with two different frequencies. Using FDD, it is possible to 
transmit and receive signals simultaneously as the receiver is not tuned to 
the same frequency as the transmitter as shown. For the FDD scheme to 
operate satisfactorily, it is necessary that the channel separation between 
the transmission and reception frequencies must be sufficient to enable the 
receiver not to be unduly affected by the transmitter signal. This is known 
as the guard band.
••
TDD is used with data transmissions (data or digitized voice), transmitting 
a short burst of data in each direction. With this constraint, the duplexer 
is nothing more than a T/R switch. The transmission periods are relatively 
short to minimize time delay on voice transmissions. While FDD transmis­
sions require a guard band between the transmitter and receiver frequencies, 
TDD schemes require a guard time or guard interval between transmission 
and reception. This must be sufficient to allow the signals traveling from the 
remote transmitter to arrive before a transmission is started and the receiver 
inhibited. For systems communicating over short distances (e.g., a few ki­
lometers), the guard interval is normally small and acceptable. For greater 
distances it may become an issue. The guard interval required for TDD will 
comprise two main elements:
•	 A time allowance for the propagation delay for any transmissions from 
the remote transmitter to arrive at the receiver. This will depend upon 
the distances involved, but it takes 3.3 ms to travel a kilometer, 5.4 ms 
to travel 1 mile. 
Figure 4.15  Simplified diagram of the RF portion of a transmit/receive radio station.

82 
�������������������������������������������
Link Properties Under Free Space Conditions
•	 A time allowance for the radio to change from receive to transmit. 
Switching speeds can vary considerably between equipment and can 
range from a few microseconds to tens of milliseconds.
Either technique can be used over land, sea, and air paths. LEO Iridium actu­
ally used TDD since it provided the dual benefits of a low-cost DUP in the handset 
and established the link in both directions with the same frequency. Multipath, in 
particular, is frequency sensitive and would have caused greater difficulties in two-
way voice connections. FDD is the standard technique beyond LEO and requires 
separate transmit and receive frequencies, the scheme contemplated in most ITU 
frequency allocations for space communications. The DUP is actually a set of fil­
ters (and possibly an orthomode transducer that combines two polarizations). In 
terrestrial radiocommunication (including OFDM), FDD is needed for broadband 
communications owing to the difficulty of fast switching of transmit and receive 
and the bandwidth required to meet service requirements.
Referring to the details of Figure 4.15 and considering only the transmit di­
rection (from left to right), we first encounter the transmitter itself. As discussed 
above, its output power would be measured in one of the standard forms but can 
be converted to dBW for this calculation. The carrier passes through a transmis­
sion line with a fixed attenuation (loss), Lt , the loss of the DUP, Ldup, and the loss 
of the transmission line, Lg, to the antenna itself. These values correspond to the 
transmission band that the system is intended for. The EIRP for this transmitting 
station is simply

This equation assumes that there are no mismatch losses due to reflections at 
junctions of cables and devices or at the antenna itself, which has a gain of Gt. 
Any spurious outputs of the transmitter might be attenuated in the DUP, but this 
is generally not assumed because the unit is designed to combine transmit and re­
ceive with minimal loss. A transmitter that emits out of band will probably require 
a bandpass filter with the concomitant loss to be included in the computation of 
EIRP. The transmission line that extends to the antenna itself will depend on the 
application. If the antenna is located on a tower and the transmitter is at the base, 
which is typical of wireless and microwave installations, then this line will be one 
with low loss per foot or meter. For frequencies below approximately 6 GHz, rigid 
coaxial cable with air dielectric and a helical spacer (heliax) is generally preferred. 
At 6 GHz and above, the line would be waveguide sized for the particular transmit 
and receive frequencies. These transmission lines provide very effective isolation 
and protection from RFI that may couple in from around the locality.
The antenna on the right in Figure 4.15, discussed in detail in Chapter 2, pro­
vides the transition between electrical signals and electromagnetic signals, using 
the principle that this conversion should be as efficient as possible. The maximum 
gain of the antenna, Gt(0), for a circular aperture can be estimated with the for­
mula provided in Chapter 2 and typically demonstrates an aperture efficiency of 
between 55% and 70%, or an equivalent loss ranging from a high of 2.6 dB to a 
low of 1.5 dB. Antennas can do better or worse, based on the specific construction 
and frequency of operation. Antenna gain is measured in the far field and typically 

4.2  Line-of-Sight Propagation Characteristics in Atmosphere

quoted as the peak value at a specific frequency (because gain typically increases as 
the square of the frequency, in nominal terms) in a specified direction. Gain at other 
frequencies may not even be quoted and could be a concern with respect to out-of-
band radiation or coupling to space. The peak gain is important for point-to-point 
links and occurs if and only if the antenna is aligned properly. Owing to installation 
errors and the effects of propagation through the atmosphere, however, there can 
be variation in gain due to the angle of arrival of the wave departing from ideal. 
This can be addressed by allowing an error, such as the 3-dB point on the antenna 
pattern, represented by the 3-dB beamwidth, θ3db. The loss for this angular offset 
is, by definition, 3 dB. The actual angle involved can be estimated from

where f is the frequency in GHz and D is the aperture diameter in meters. The actual 
antenna pattern should be consulted when designing or evaluating a real system and 
patterns of the type provided in Chapter 2 should be consulted. Of importance are 
the sidelobes and backlobes shown dotted with the antenna in Figure 4.15. Their 
contribution to RFI will be discussed in detail in Chapter 8.
4.2.2  Alternative Measures of Signal Strength
While transmitted power is reasonably straightforward in terms of computation 
and measurement, the received side of the equation can become a complex mat­
ter. One reason is that there are many ways of expressing the amount of energy 
that is delivered to the far end. The particular form will depend on the general 
standards and context as well as the technical characteristic of the particular radio­
communication system. Computing these levels may be straightforward, including 
measures of RFI that the particular transmitter might produce at the input to the 
victim receiver. As a communications systems engineer, one has to understand these 
variations and be able to translate among them. An overview of the more salient 
measures of received RF energy appears in Table 4.1. These consider line-of-sight 
propagation in free space without atmospheric effects, which will be considered in 
the next subsections. All of these measures can be related to one another through

4.2.3  Atmospheric Loss
The troposphere contains gasses that absorb and therefore attenuate radio signals, 
particularly those above 1 GHz. Terrestrial line-of-sight paths as well as ATG and 
space-to-Earth paths will experience some degree of atmospheric loss. There have 
been many studies and measurements of this phenomenon and it is well understood. 
The ITU, for example, has published recommended values and formulations that 
are useful for estimating purposes [11]. Figure 4.16 presents the specific attenua­
tion, measured in dB/km, for a terrestrial path that is horizontal or nearly horizon­
tal. We see that there are two primary constituents: dry air and water vapor. These 
are given individually and summed in the top curve. At 6 GHz, the attenuation is 
only 0.01 dB/km; for a 50-km path, this amounts to 0.5 dB, total. Above 6 GHz, 
the attenuation rises monotonically to a peak of 2 dB/km at 22 GHz and then dips 
down before reaching a big peak of 15 dB/km at 66 GHz. The peaks at 22 GHz 
and 66 GHz are produced by molecular resonance from water vapor and oxygen, 
respectively, as is clear from the data. The total curve would give the impression 
that the troposphere is benign for freuencies below about 20 GHz with respect to 
air and water vapor. The conditions of temperature inversion and ducting, how­
ever, can cause deep fades for short periods. As a result, line-of-sight microwave 
systems may employ space or frequency divisity to counter the fade and maintain 
high availability.
The space-to-Earth path will pass through the entire troposphere, but the path 
length depends on the angle of arrival. The same can be said for ATG with the 
proviso that the value will also depend on altitude. Figure 4.17 provides the data 
for a path toward the zenith (i.e., for a vertical direction from the ground to space).
This value is the lowest or best case since the path length through the atmo­
sphere is a minimum. For other angles (slanted), the sine of the angle applies:

where φ is the elevation angle from the ground. A0 and Aw are attenuation values to 
the zenith from the oxygen and water vapor curves, respectively, at the frequency of 
operation; their sum is simply the total curve value. Both this relationship and the 
graph are valid for elevation angles between 5° and 90°; below 5°, use Figure 4.16 
and calculate the total attenuation based on path length.
4.2.4  Rain Attenuation
Rain is a dominant source of attenuation and signal outage at frequencies above 
approximately 10 GHz. It is caused by raindrops, which scatter and absorb radio 
waves, and raincells, which are clouds with water present in liquid form. The degree 
to which the path is subject to rain attenuation will depend on a number of factors 
[12]. The geographic region has the strongest influence and is categorized in terms 

4.2  Line-of-Sight Propagation Characteristics in Atmosphere 
85
of rain rates, with tropical regions having the greatest intensity. But temperate cli­
mates also experience thunderstorms that produce heavy rain and the attenuation 
that comes with it. Rain attenuation is usually presented in terms of a probability 
of a certain rain rate or greater occurring, expressed as the specified value in mm/
hour, or less. On this basis, you can plan on the link operating reliably if you design 
Figure 4.16  Specific attenuation due to atmospheric gases (ITU-R).

for this amount of rainfall for a specified probability, which is called the availability. 
The rain rate can be turned into a corresponding rain attenuation value based on 
the frequency and the elevation angle of the path through the rain. A horizontal 
path in terrestrial communications would experience the most water and therefore 
have the highest rain attenuation for a given percentage of time. As the elevation

angle increases toward 90°, attenuation is reduced because there is less water to 
overcome.
Rain attenuation is a strong function of frequency and rain rate, as illustrated 
in Figure 4.18 [13]. The details for calculating the specific rain attenuation from 
the rain rate can be found in ITU-R Recommendation P.838. Missing from the data 
is the path length to be used to covert specific attenuation into an absolute value. 
The characteristic of rain is that the path length is itself a function of rain rate and 
other factors. Figure 4.18 indicates that generally rain attenuation increases mono­
tonically up to about 150 GHz, at which point it flattens. Rainfall at 150 mm/hr, 
the highest on the graph, corresponds to tropical regions around the equator and 
for perhaps only 0.01% of the time. Rates near 50 mm/hr are experienced during 
thunderstorms in temperate climates.
As a simple example, consider a line-of-sight 14-GHz path that traverses a 
raincell of 2-km dimension. Assume the location is in the Northeastern United 
States with a corresponding rain rate of 50 mm/hr at 0.01% outage. Figure 4.18 
gives a specific attenuation of approximately 2 dB/km, yielding a total rain attenu­
ation of 4 dB. This is based on an estimated path length through the cell of 2 km, 
but this will depend on local conditions. Other examples are provided in [14].
The way rainfall distributes across Earth is illustrated in Figure 4.19, which is 
taken from the commonly applied ITU Dissanyake, Allnutt, and Haidara (DAH) 
model [15].
Figure 4.18  Specific attenuation due to rain versus frequency for various rainfall rates.

Link Properties Under Free Space Conditions
What remains is a means to compute the total rain attenuation for a given 
path, including its elevation angle if applicable. Much work was done for space-to-
ground communications, and this can be extended to terrestrial paths as well. The 
ITU DAH model is the best place to start because it is the most extensively used on 
a global basis. There is still the possibility of local conditions impacting the rain 
on the path, and there is no substitute for experience with the particular location 
and systems.
Rain also has the effect of scattering radiowaves, causing them to traverse be­
yond the local horizon. This, or course, only happens when it is raining but may 
need to be considered when frequencies are reused with a range of approximately 
100 km.
4.2.5  Tropospheric Scatter
Tropospheric scatter is a mode of propagation that was developed for over-the-
horizon use before satellites generally became available. Systems of this type have 
largely gone out of use except in some remote parts of the world and for temporary 
service. It takes advantage of signal propagation by turbulence in a volume of air, 
which produces a relatively weak by stable signal through scattering and refrac­
tion in the troposphere. Figure 4.20 provides a simplified diagram of how this type 
of point-to-point link functions where the requisite scatter occurs in the common 
volume defined by the overlap of the two radio station beams. The signal experi­
ences both slow and fast fading due to the effects of multipath, causing the signal 
level to vary with time of day, season of year, and latitude, among other variables. 
Also, the signal levels average 10 dB lower in winter than summer, and morning and 
evening signals are 5 dB stronger than in midafternoon [14]. The reliability of this 
mode, however, is superior to HF skywave but lower than for most satellite links.

Troposcatter propagation may represent another mechanism by which RFI enters a 
victim nontroposcatter radiocommunication system.
In this chapter, we reviewed many mechanisms by which both the desired sig­
nal and the RFI can propagate from transmitter to receiver. An understanding of 
these principles can prove vital when investigating the cause of RFI and its remedia­
tion. In the next chapter, we review how obstacles and other media will influence 
propagation and generally make RFI play an even stronger role in developing and 
operating a radiocommunication system.

Propagation on Obstructed Paths
We now consider the types of obstructed radio paths experienced on Earth, both 
terrestrial and space-to-Earth. The discussion of line-of-sight propagation through 
atmosphere still applies and the losses of the previous chapter must be included as 
well (unless the obstructed path substantially alters the environment). Geographic 
features like hills, mountain ranges, and valleys have a pronounced impact, par­
ticularly as frequency increases above about 30 MHz and especially in the micro­
wave range. Their characteristics have been well understood with the availability of 
global 3D mapping and GPS. Buildings also introduce blockage and are important 
in mobile systems in city streets and where interior penetration is desired. This is 
difficult to predict and often relies on direct measurements. Vegetation brings in 
another variable as there can be a seasonal variation, along with growth patterns 
that take years. Finally, the precise location of an end user is another variable: 
where they stand or place antennas, including use inside vehicles and other modes 
of transportation. Consider also that RFI usually comes from a different direction 
than the desired signal, resulting in wide variation in antenna gain and the value of 
C/I that exists for a particular situation and timing. The static situation is one that 
can more easily be addressed than one where either the user or the cause of RFI, 
or both, are on the move. Another variable is due to the propagation path itself, 
especially with regard to infrequent phenomena like ducting and rain scatter that 
allow RFI to appear in an otherwise isolated system. These factors are considered 
in models developed over the years and reviewed in this chapter.
5.1  Path Profiles and Obstructions
The path profile is the primary tool for understanding the natural obstructions 
that attenuate radio signals, introduce diffraction paths, and offer the potential for 
extended range. It is plotted as the cross-section of Earth along the path between 
transmitter and receiver. The transmitter could emit the desired signal or it could 
be the source of RFI. Likewise, the receiver is the point of reception of desired and 
undesired signals. As a result, we need to understand potential paths, for every 
location where operations are intended. The tools discussed at the end of this chap­
ter offer an automated means of preparing and evaluating profiles; otherwise, we

must use topographic maps of the type used in surveying and by the military. An 
example of a hand-drawn path profile including 4/3 Earth curvature, as prepared 
by the author in 1967, is given in Figure 5.1. This illustrates the virtual line-of-sight 
along the bottom, which is blocked by the mountains, and the diffraction path over 
the highest peak. The latter has the effect of avoiding the second, lower, peak. The 
amount of diffraction loss can be computed using the procedure given in Section 
5.3. Note that this path is beyond line of sight due to low height of the endpoints.
Diffraction loss is a straightforward calculation, based on the same theory as 
affects the diffraction of light [1]. Figure 5.2 illustrates the arrangement of the geo­
metric elements and their relationship to the Fresnel Zone, discussed in Chapter 4. 
The upper illustration shows how the obstacle blocks the line-of-sight path; yet, 
some signal will propagate through diffraction with the amount depending on the 
height, h, relative to the dimensions of the first Fresnel Zone. In the lower illustra­
tion, the path is not blocked, but the obstacle introduces some loss that is again 
dependent on the degree of impingement of the first Fresnel Zone.
The dimensionless Fresnel-Kirchoff diffraction parameter, υ, is a necessary step 
to calculate the diffraction loss:

The diffraction loss will depend on whether h is negative, as in the lower figure, 
or positive, as in the upper figure. The following formulae can be used to calculate 
the loss in dB as a function of the diffraction parameter, υ:

The combination of these equations are plotted in Figure 5.3 to cover the range 
from the first impingement on the first Fresnel Zone, to the obstacle just touch­
ing the line-of-sight path (which is a loss of 6 dB a v = 0), to blockage that ranges 
through total blockage of the signal.
Knife-edge diffraction requires good clearance at the respective antennas and 
only the presence of the obstacle or obstacles over the path. In the latter case, each 
knife edge is computed separately and their total loss simply added. This may pre­
dict more loss than actually experienced, as in the case of the path in Figure 5.1. 
The large obstacle alters the path and any remaining obstacles need to be treated 
with respect to a more complex geometry [2]. Obstacles are important sources of 
isolation that protect one operating radiocommunication system from potential 
RFI from others. Real geography can provide very stable isolation and is often the 
best source of such protection.
Propagation across smooth Earth at frequencies above approximately 100 
MHz is governed by a combination of free space and diffraction but is different 
owning to the lack of a knife-edge terrain feature. This is illustrated in Figure 5.4 
for a smooth Earth path with antennas elevated to a height of h1 and h2 in meters 
and a total distance of D in km. Distances d1 and d2 correspond to the range from 
Figure 5.2  Illustration of geometries for diffraction paths: blocked path and line-of-sight path with 
partial blockage [1]. The dotted ellipses represent the first Fresnel Zone.

antenna to the horizon, and include K factor of 4/3 Earth curvature. Distance d3 is 
that portion of D that is beyond line of sight for the total link. We provide sample 
calculations using the procedure developed by Bullington [3] using Figure 6 (re­
printed below as Figure 5.5), a nomogram for determining each of three contribu­
tors to the total attenuation. This is in addition to the free space loss calculated 
with the formula in Chapter 4. The original nomogram, created in 1957, uses feet 
and miles and is fairly straightforward in its application. The same method was 
made available in a slide ruled developed by J. Deygout [4]. We provide another 
example in Table 5.1 using metric values: total path length, 100 km; height of an­
tenna, 50 m on both ends; and three different frequencies of operation, 100 MHz, 
1 GHz, and 10 GHz. The results are presented in Table 5.1 and present diffraction 
loss alone; the free space loss for the path is fixed and can be calculated from the 
equation in Chapter 4.
According to the Bullington method, each segment of distance produces an 
amount of loss, as indicated in the columns. The total loss for the path, exclu­
sive of the free space component, is simply the sum of the three segment losses. 
We see from Table 5.1 that total smooth Earth attenuation increases rapidly with 
frequency for column d3 (i.e., in which there is no line of sight). Operation in the 
VHF spectrum still offers reasonable propagation across smooth Earth, but the 
attenuation almost doubles in dB for an increase in frequency from 1 GHz to 10 
GHz. Note also that free space loss increases as well, at the rate of 20 dB per factor 
of 10 increase in frequency. This overall behavior is consistent with how spectrum 
is reassigned across geography, but ignores the potential for knife-edge diffraction 
from tall hills and buildings and other modes of propagation such as ducting or 
scatter that can provide higher levels of RFI than are predicted in this manner. The 
models and software discussed later in this chapter provide a means of evaluating 
more terrain options.

The methodologies just explained are relatively straightforward and repeatable 
but make assumptions about the path and terrain. Real-world situations can differ 
greatly, especially when considering the effect of foliage, buildings (including inside 
buildings) and obstructions found in suburban and urban areas. There has been a 
lot of research in the past, looking at various environments and taking measure­
ments at different frequencies with different types of antennas. Examples of com­
plex terrain models are given in Section 5.3. As one would imagine, there is a lot of 
variability in all of this as there are no definite, predetermined answers. It is an area 
requiring a lot of trial and error and a practical approach. The next section consid­
ers fading due to multipath, which brings another large variable into this critical 
evaluation of both the desired and the potentially interfering signal.

Propagation on Obstructed Paths
5.2  Fading on Direct and Blocked Paths
The topic of multipath was introduced in Chapter 4 and depicted for a line-of-sight 
path in Figure 4.8. We have reproduced this in Figure 5.6 and will show two impor­
tant fading mechanisms in radiocommunication in the presence of reflections alone 
and under the influence of heavy obstructions; these are Ricean fading and Rayleigh 
fading, respectively. Either form of fading occurs through the vector addition of 
multiple samples of the same radio signal which result from the aforementioned 
reflection and obstruction. It is vector addition because the signal at its particular 
frequency can be represented by its amplitude and phase, presented as a phasor. 
The tower in Figure 5.6 could be a terrestrial repeater or base station, or it could 
represent a communications satellite or aircraft.
5.2.1  Direct and Reflected Signals: Vector Addition
We now take the direct signal and the multipath signal, one of each, and examine 
how they interact at the antenna on the mobile receiver. Two sine waves at fre­
quency f0 can be added to each other in vector form to produce a resultant ampli­
tude, Ar, at a phase angle, φr:

The imaginary exponents are a mathematical way of representing the phase 
angles of the respective phasors. This is evaluated graphically in Figure 5.6 for 
the case of the direct line-of-sight signal and the signal reflected off the ground in 
Figure 5.6. If the direct and reflected happen to combine in phase, which can occur 
if the reflected path is exactly one full wavelength longer, then the resultant signal 
has increased amplitude and is simply equal to A1 + A2. On the other hand, if there 
is a phase difference of 180° for a reflected path that is exactly a half a wavelength 
longer, then there is cancellation and the resultant is A1 – A2. All other conditions 
for a constant reflected signal amplitude are presented by the dotted circle in Figure 
5.7. The precise condition will depend on the difference in path length, which is 
geometry, and the frequency of operation. The latter point means that the fading 
will depend on the specific frequency, or in other words, will present what is called 
selective fading. If we are using frequency division duplex (FDD), which is most 
common in two-way radiocommunication, then it is likely that the transmit and 
receive links will fade differently on an instantaneous basis. The same properties 
Figure 5.6  Simplified diagram depicting a mobile receiver that is subject to multipath.

5.2  Fading on Direct and Blocked Paths 
97
apply to an interfering signal as well. This argues for additional protection margin 
if multipath is anticipated.
5.2.2  Ricean Multipath Fading
The condition in Figure 5.7 is one in which the direct signal, Ar is fairly constant 
and not significantly attenuated by shadowing. This is referred to as Ricean fad­
ing in recognition of its statistical behavior. It can be observed in terms of signal 
strength of an operating link, which is discussed next.
How multipath can influence link quality is illustrated in Figure 5.8, which 
presents the measured signal strength at 2.2 GHz transmitted by a GEO satellite 
low on the horizon. The portion of the graph of interest is the right half, labeled 
“Outside Building (Ricean).” The left half of the graph will be discussed in the next 
section. The receiver and antenna were handheld and carried along an outdoor 
walkway on the side of the building facing the downlink path. We see decided fades 
and dips of typically 6 dB but as much as 10 dB relative to nominal (free space)

Propagation on Obstructed Paths
level. Note also that there are peaks of signal enhancement of up to about 3 dB, 
behavior that is expected in light of the phasor diagram in Figure 5.7. 
The periodic nature of the trace is the result of the slow motion of walking 
as the reflected signal vector rotates around the direct path signal vector and is a 
consequence of the particular wavelength and velocity of the walker. There is also 
a fixed point of reflection such as another building causing the geometry to change 
with motion of the receiver. Alternatively, if the point of reflection was from flat 
ground in the direction of the satellite (i.e., a point that moves with motion) the 
amount of attenuation (or enhancement) would have been constant or unvarying. 
This is because the satellite is so distant (36,000 km away) that the angle of arrival 
at the receiver does not change with motion.
The Ricean fading mechanism is well understand and its behavior is fairly be­
nign. It can be addressed with a reasonable amount of margin, typically 6 dB, so 
that both terrestrial and satellite links can be maintained in its presence. Interfer­
ence conditions at the receiver may involve more dynamic properties, particularly 
if the desired signal is distant but the RFI is close.
5.2.3  Rayleigh Fading
The radio environment that most of us experience as mobile device users is that pro­
duced by Rayleigh fading. We expect to use our wireless devices no matter where 
we are: at home, in office buildings, on rail lines and busses, and even on airplanes 
after landing. In most cases, the direct line-of-sight path to the emitting base sta­
tion is blocked and we employ what signal exists in the time and place of our oc­
cupancy. The complexity of these situations is illustrated in Figure 5.9 in which the 
direct path to the user in the truck is blocked by a tree. In urban areas, the mobile 
device would more likely be in a building. Multipath signals will occur at the same 
time and these may or may not be blocked. As a result, the vectors in Figure 5.6 
are altered in that the reflected signal may actually be stronger than the direct (but 
attenuated) signal. Any interference must be considered in a conservative way and 
it could be received without such attenuation. Service inside a building without 
Figure 5.9  Radiocommunication in the wireless world often involves using a non-line-of-sight path 
to the emitter, relying instead on signals that have been absorbed, reflected and diffracted before 
reception. There is also the presence of additional such signals that combine on a vectoral basis, 
producing fading that is dependent on position and is widely variable.

5.2  Fading on Direct and Blocked Paths 
99
internal repeaters is even more complex and difficult as the ability to receive ad­
equate signal (direct or indirect) depends on the precise location inside and the 
construction of the building itself.
A phasor diagram for Rayleigh fading is a jumble of vectors that represent frag­
ments of the original signal that have experienced a variety of propagation mecha­
nisms. As illustrated in Figure 5.10, the resultant, Ar , can actually be stronger than 
what exists of the direct signal, A1. If all elements are static, then the resultant will 
also be static; however, if any contributor is variable (changing power, direction, 
distance, velocity, etc.), that the resultant can experience wide variations and at 
times disappear altogether. This is illustrated on the left side of Figure 5.7 where we 
see more than 10 dB of attenuation relative to free space combined with even deep­
er fades of the signal as one moves around the interior of the building in question.
Further to the subject of building penetration, Figure 5.11 shows locations and 
orientations of structures in the same testing performed at Jet Propulsion Laborato­
ry in La Cañada, California, using the TDRS satellite. Its low elevation angle of 22° 
makes this relevant for terrestrial radiocommunication as well as space to ground 
communication. Engineering measurements were made with a handheld receiver as 
the holder worked through and outside of Building 161. In addition to blockage by 
the building walls, the path was at times blocked by a high rise building located to 
the west-southwest. These features produce a fading environment that covers liter­
ally all facets, especially Rayleigh fading within much of the building. The actual

produces the variations in signal strength over a 50-dB dynamic range, allowing a 
precise study of the Rayleigh-induced signal fading.
The text boxes in Figure 5.12 indicate the location of the receiver, beginning 
from outside the building and entering some interior offices. Without blockage 
from the adjacent structure, the signal levels appear to average about 15 dB of at­
tenuation with some excursions below –30 dB. The section on the second floor out­
side stairs presents minor shadowing loss of about 3 dB along with Ricean fading 
of up to 6 or 8 dB, and one point of near cancellation at –20 dB. Upon reentering 
the building and being blocked by the adjacent eight-story building, the signal level 
drops below –20 dB  with many nulls of over –40 dB to as much as –50 dB. This 
is a region of extremely poor coverage. Upon exiting the building to the northeast 
and proceeding to the open portion, the signal gains line of sight to TDRS and the 
fading is again Ricean. These measurements provide the reader with a good picture 
of how the fading mechanisms perform on a real world path. 
5.3  Geographic Coverage Analysis
Line-of-sight conditions are easy to analyze based on a relatively small number 
of parameters, but paths with high degrees of blockage are difficult if not impos­
sible to characterize on a general basis. Our concern relates to both components 
of C/I: desired carrier power varies depending on propagation from the desired 
emitter; interference power likely experiences a different path to reach the victim re­
ceiver. The resulting dynamics when these combine can prove intractable in a strict

mathematical sense. Hence the need for these models for estimating propagation 
over a wide area. The good news is that the RFI is only one component of the total 
C/N, which provides some mitigation in real world operations.
There have been attempts to do this by establishing categories of the kinds of 
environments that would be encountered in a given radiocommunication system. 
These could include such distinctions as: open and unobstructed, open with foli­
age, suburban with trees but without structures, suburban with structures up to 
two stories, urban with buildings up to eight stories, and urban concrete canyons. 
There is also the question of the locations of the end points: outside structures in 
the open, inside buildings, exterior to moving vehicles or aircraft, or inside a means 
of transportation. Buildings offer a wide range of variables that affect penetration: 
wood frame structures, exterior rooms in concrete structures with windows, inte­
rior rooms in concrete structures, high floors versus low floors, and a variety of 
variables having to do with the nature of the windows and ceilings. Much of this 
was investigated in connection with the mobile satellite systems under development 
in the late 1990s [6]. However, just applying a few words as a descriptor leaves out 
much of what actually differentiates environments given similar names. The inter­
action with the design of the radiocommunication system itself is critical as well. 
We review below the techniques used to establish geographic coverage in various 
environments, recognizing that the most effective methods use computation and/
or measurement based on the actual conditions of the radiocommunication system 
and the RFI that can affect it.
5.3.1  Path Computation Using Software
We have reviewed the mathematical formulae used to estimate losses due to free 
space, knife-edge obstacles, smooth Earth, and the atmosphere. To this could be 
added predicted losses versus frequency for wood, concrete, glass (without and 
with window tinting), plastic, as well as other materials that might be encountered 
in the radio path. Over the years since this author considered these factors using 
the manual techniques in the 1960s and early 1970s using topographical maps and 
calculators, a variety of computer tools have been developed and, more recently, 
marketed to the various organizations that implement and operate wireless systems. 
The basic theory has not changed, but modern tools greatly simplify and accelerate 
the process, and include topography from Google Earth and other sources as an 
integral element. Some include databases of equipment characteristics, including 
antenna properties, receivers and transmitters, and ancillary items like filters and 
transmission lines. It then becomes a relatively simple matter to configure the soft­
ware for a particular study and run the calculations across many of the variables 
that one encounters.
An example of a study performed with the modern class of analysis software 
arose from a report of RFI at a major satellite communications earth station near 
Fillmore, California. The receiver in question was connected to a 9m, 4-GHz (C 
band) receive antenna pointed out over the Pacific Ocean at an Intelsat satellite 
around 180° Longitude, which was low on the local horizon (Figure 5.13). As a 
result, the characteristics of this link are similar to terrestrial paths as well. There 
was intermittent overload of the front-end low noise amplifier, producing inter­
modulation products and reducing gain through fundamental overload. The RFI 

102

Propagation on Obstructed Paths
source identified was from S-band radar systems on board U.S. Navy ships when in 
harbor at Port Hueneme, CA. The problem was resolved by installing a bandpass 
filter between the antenna feed and the low noise amplifier, a common solution 
to problems of this nature. This was suspected because the antenna in question, 
outlined in Figure 5.13, has an alignment that suggests a high level of reception 
through the antenna close-in sidelobes.
We used this case as a basis to re-create the problem using Terrain Analysis 
Package (TAP™), PC-based terrestrial RF propagation software from Softwright 
LLC. The line-of-sight path across the terrain from Port Hueneme to Fillmore is 
given in Figure 5.14, indicating that the intervening mountains block the signal. 
This means that propagation will include a substantial diffraction loss across the 
mountain peaks.  The actual profile is plotted using TAP in Figure 5.15.
The computation of losses by TAP for two frequencies, 300 MHz and 3 GHz, 
is summarized as follows:
••
Path length 40 km (25.2 mi)
••
Free space loss is 114.2 dB at 300 MHz and 134.2 dB at 3 GHz
••
Total loss including all peaks at 300 MHz is –283.5 dB. Worst single peak 
is –22.3 dB.
••
Total loss including all peaks at 3 GHz is –431.7 dB. Worst single peak is 
–40.0 dB.
These losses at 300 MHz and 3 GHz are extremely high and more than enough 
to protect the receiver at Fillmore. So, the question is, how can the RFI in fact 
happen? If we look at the map, it is possible to recognize that there is a clear path 
Figure 5.13  Antennas at the Fillmore, CA, earth station. The RFI victim antenna is pointed at an 
Intelsat satellite at 180° longitude and is close to the horizon.

across the valley encompassing Ventura. The most likely source of the radar signal 
is from the ship when it is in coastal waters away from port but in the line of sight 
afforded by the valley path. This theory has not been verified, a step that might be 
needed if the filter had not cured the problem.
5.3.2  Measures of Radio Coverage
Terrestrial wireless systems are intended to provide coverage of some area of ter­
rain. Software like TAP has the means within it to compute multiple paths from, 
say, a base station around a circumference of intended service. The computations

includes Ventura, CA.

follow the same process but are done in rapid succession to give the appearance of 
a blanket of radiation to see where there might be gaps and holes. Once this is done, 
an operator would use scouting vehicles to make measurements around the cover­
age area to validate the prediction and help understand if additional base stations 
are needed. The same process can be used to evaluate how undesired signals might 
extend beyond the intended area of coverage and present RFI to neighboring users.
Spectrum managers and regulators have the difficult task of assigning bands 
of frequencies to different users who in many cases must use the same frequencies. 
This can be accommodated if there is sufficient terrain isolation between areas on 
the same bandwidths. We have discussed how propagation can extend beyond line 
of sight through mechanisms such as refraction, diffraction, ducting and scatter. 
The practice is to establish boundaries based on generalized models of coverage, 
which are discussed in the next section. This can be validated or modified through 
detailed investigations along point-to-point paths across the geography using soft­
ware such as TAP. Figures 5.16 and 5.17 compare two approaches for service in 
a common area [7]. The FCC model in Figure 5.16 portrays clean coverage of the 
area around the northeast corner of Jefferson County, CO, with some variation due 
to a general trend of geography. It indicates areas of high signal strength as well as 
areas where the signals are perhaps measurable but not of high intensity. Beyond 
the outer area, no signal is predicted into the surrounding counties.
When we look at a more accurate portrayal of coverage, however, taking ac­
count of actual paths emanating from the central point, signal strength variation 
is much greater and range can extend well beyond the expected limits posed in the 
FCC model. Note that the area of most intense coverage around the center is very 
similar between the two approaches. The extensive departure occurs beyond line of 
sight where propagation over and around terrain obstacles dominates. A compre­
hensive discussion and presentation of the various propagation models at a detailed 
level can be found in [8].

5.4  Complex Propagation Models
The evaluation of propagation and RFI over wide areas has been a challenge to the 
rapid expansion of radiocommunication. An approach is to employ some type of 
comprehensive model that can be agreed-upon and employed at least as a starting 
point in the system development and spectrum management process. We review 
a few of the more prominent models below; several references are suggested for 
further study and application; [8] in particular, presents an excellent discussion 
of models and their relative merits. Many of the details of the propagation char­
acteristics were given previously, including relevant formulas and data. However, 
the application of the models is still problematic owing to the irregular behavior 
of physical topography and characteristics of the radio systems themselves. The 
atmosphere also produces considerable variability. The following caveats are given 
in the fine paper cited here:
••
None of the models studied provided an adjustment for reflections from 
buildings and hills (which may provide signal enhancement but cause fading 
as well);
••
None of the models studied made an allowance for transmission loss due to 
foliage (which can change with seasons, growth and removal);
••
The Longley-Rice model underestimated the transmission for most typical 
mobile situations;
••
The Okumura urban model generally overestimated the transmission loss for 
most United States cities (because data for the former were collected around 
and in Tokyo, Japan);
••
Both TIREM and Longley-Rice models provided serious discontinuities in 
the transmission loss values when changing from one mode of propagation 
to another;

••
None of the models studied provided data on sector transmission loss dis­
tributions due to multipath reception, except to assume a loss deviation of 
8.2 dB (which is well below expectation for conditions of Rayleigh fading).
The models we have chosen, particularly that of the Institute for Telecom­
munications Sciences (ITS) of the US National Institute of Science and Technology 
(NIST), formerly the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), have fairly wide accep­
tance for general studies of radiowave propagation in the terrestrial environment. 
In addition, they are best used to perform general and preliminary studies of the 
RFI that would exist in or could be caused by operation of a radiocommunication 
system. The ITU-R offers their methodology for predicting interference between 
radio stations on the surface of the Earth, employing various propagation models 
as previously discussed [9].
5.4.1  Okumura and Hata Macroscopic Propagation Models
One of the oldest terrestrial radio frequency propagation models was developed 
empirically in the Tokyo, Japan, area by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) 
Electrical Communication Laboratory (ECL). Published in 1968 by the team led by 
Dr. Yoshihisa Okumura, who was recognized in April 2013 for outstanding contri­
butions to the advancement of engineering by the National Academy of Engineering 
[10]. The Okumura model, as it is well known, still performs well as a benchmark 
for evaluating terrestrial propagation environments in built-up areas, especially cit­
ies. The model is presented in terms of basic equations and graphical results from 
measurements, provided in parametric form for frequencies between 200 and 1,920 
MHz [10]. Owing to the complexity of the model, a more convenient form was 
produced by Masaharu Hata in 1980 for ease of computer programming [11, 12]. 
Our caveat regarding the variability of environments (and their interpretation) is 
intelligently addressed by Okumura and Hata through the naming of three funda­
mental area types:
••
Urban: “Built-up city or large town crowded with large buildings and two- 
or-more-storied houses, or in a larger village closely interspersed with houses 
and thickly-grown tall trees.” These are subclassified for the purposes of cor­
recting for mobile antenna heights as follows:
•	 Large city
•	 Medium city
••
Suburban: “Village or highway scattered with trees and houses—the area 
having some obstacles near the mobile radio car, but still not very congested.” 
••
Open: “No obstacles like tall trees or buildings in the propagation path and a 
plot of land which is cleared of anything 300 to 400m ahead, as, for instance, 
farmland, rice field, open fields, etc.”  These are subclassified as follows:
•	 Open
•	 Quasiopen (defined as midway between Open and Suburban)

5.4  Complex Propagation Models 
107
The basic Okumura model employs a simple equation in dB, similar in con­
cept to the link budget of Chapter 4. The formula addresses the free space loss 
as well as a terrain loss term for the median loss from an urban environment. 
The assumed transmit and receive antennas have elevations of 200 m and 3 m, 
respectively. There are adjustment terms, discussed below, to account for different 
antenna heights (more loss if the antenna is lower, less loss if the antenna is higher). 
The total path loss for a terrestrial radio link from a base station tower to a mobile 
terminal can be expressed as

where
L50 is the median path loss between transmitter and receiver;
LFS is the free space computed from the range equation, reduced by the sum of 
the gain of the transmit and receive antennas;
Amu is the basic median attenuation due to propagation in an urban environment;
Htu is the height gain correction factor (variation from the assumed base sta­
tion height of 200m); and
Hru is the height gain correction factor (variation from the assumed mobile 
terminal antenna height of 3m)
The basic median attenuation is taken from a graph in Okumura, while Hata 
has developed curve-fitted equations that eliminate the graphs. Figure 5.18 is from 
[11] and presents the basic mean attenuation as a function of frequency with path

length from 1 to 100 km as a parameter. As an example from the graph, the basic 
median attenuation at 1,000 MHz (1 GHz) and a range of 60 km is approximately 
50 dB. This accounts for the existence of terrain in the urban environment and is in 
addition to the free-space loss, which can be computed as 128 dB. Summing these 
values gives 178 dB as the median path loss between transmitter and receiver for 
the assumed heights and environment.
The height gain correction factors can be estimated from data presented in Fig­
ures 5.19 and 5.20 for the base station and mobile terminal antennas, respectively. 
The effective antenna height is calculated as the height of the antenna’s radiation 
above the average terrain, calculated along the direction of the radio path for the 
distance between 3 and 15 km of the respective antenna. A base station antenna 
above 200m yields a positive gain, while one below 200m yields a negative gain. 
Applying Figure 5.19, at 100m height and a 1-km distance, the base station an­
tenna gain, Htu, is approximately -4 dB. In the case of the vehicular antenna (Figure 
5.20) at 800 MHz and with a height of 5 m yields a gain of approximately 2 dB 
relative to the 3m reference antenna in a large city (e.g., Tokyo). According to [13], 
corrections in Figures 5.19 and 5.20 are seldom used.
These graphs are for the urban/large city environment. The basic median 
field strength will be increased (reduced attenuation) for suburban (6 to 14 dB), 
quasiopen (18.5 to 27.5 dB), and open areas (23.5 to 32.5 dB). According to [14]:
Care should be exercised in selecting the area type to use, keeping in mind the fact 
that these definitions are based on Japanese environs. Application to U.S. and other 
cities should make appropriate adjustments.
As discussed previously, the Hata models provide empirical formulas that replace 
the graphs found in Okumura. These employ linear and parabolic approximations

that are within 0.5 dB to 1 dB of the original data. Owing to the greater variability 
and uncertainty of our knowledge of the precise topography and atmospherics, 
these errors can be ignored.
5.4.2  ITS: Longley-Rice Models
The Okumura and Hata models just discussed are practical structures that are us­
able for a variety of planning purposes in the specific field of land mobile com­
munications. However, there remains the more general problem of assessing signal 
strength and potential RFI across a broader field of frequencies, terrain types, and 
propagation modes that extend well beyond line of sight (even considering diffrac­
tion). Several agencies of the U.S. Government have investigated and developed 
models of such propagation and made these available in the form of written reports 
and computer code. The most respected and the oldest of these is based on the 
work of the ITS at NBS (now NIST). The names of two principle researchers, A.G. 
Longley and P.L. Rice, are used to refer to these methods and programs, much in the 
way that Okumura is used as a collective reference to the work performed around 
the same period in Japan. A complete review of the basic modeling approach and 
content can be found in Technical Note 101 [15], produced in 1965, and further 
clarified in [16]. Another name applied to the approach is the “ITS irregular terrain 
model,” wherein a series of parameters must be defined for each path [9]:
••
Frequency;
••
Polarization;
••
Path length;
••
Antenna heights above ground;
••
Surface refractivity;
Figure 5.20  Mobile station height correction gain (after Okumura [11]).

Propagation on Obstructed Paths
••
Effective Earth’s radius;
••
Climate;
••
Ground conductivity; and
••
Ground dielectric constant.
A series of path-specific parameters must be defined as well:
••
Effective antenna heights;
••
Horizon distances of the antennas;
••
Horizon elevation angles;
••
The angular distance for a trans-horizon path; and
••
Terrain irregularity of the path.
There are two prediction modes: point-to-point and area coverage. To perform 
the analysis using point-to-point mode, the actual path profile must be known so 
that individual paths can be evaluated. While unavailable at the time, the graphical 
computing tools given in Section 5.3.1 are invaluable for point-to-point evalua­
tions. Lacking these specifics, the area coverage mode allows prediction of cover­
age based on assumed topographical environment characteristics as in the Oku­
mura model. Such a comparison was given in Figures 5.16 and 5.17.
The documents are all available on line and software is available both as free 
download and from suppliers like Softwright LLC. and EDX Wireless Inc., so we 
will not reproduce the details here. They are also subject to many revisions and 
extensions, and it can be concluded that the expression “the devil is in the details” 
clearly applies here. The U.S. DoD has also developed its own model called Terrain-
Integrated Rough Earth Model (TIREM), described in [17]. These approaches have 
the benefit of giving answers when data is lacking or incomplete but bring with 
them uncertainty of the type discussed in Section 5.3. This uncertainty translates 
into RFI experiences that might not have been detected based on analysis using 
area-coverage type analysis. Point-to-point analysis, therefore, will always be pre­
ferred and is how we addressed the existence of RFI in the example in Section 5.3.1.
The age of computer analysis and large databases has greatly eased the chal­
lenge of coverage and link studies. With the right tools, almost any radiocommuni­
cation system can be evaluated as to the range of transmission, both for the desired 
and undesired signals. The art keeps advancing every year, based mainly on the 
sophistication of data processing, manipulation and presentation. The underlying 
theory, on the other hand, never changes.

Interference Protection Ratio (C/I) and Its 
Application
Interference analysis and performance prediction is founded on the principles in 
radiocommunication of signals detected in noise. We address the RFI much like an 
accountant since it is often a detailed study of all of the interference cases, called 
entries, and adding them up to assess the typical and worst cases. The most basic 
measure of RFI potential is the protection ratio, defined simply as the ratio of de­
sired carrier power to interference power. As discussed in previous chapters, it is 
relatively straight forward to calculate these power levels using link budget tech­
niques along with knowledge of the propagation paths that both signals may take. 
In the case of cofrequency RFI, the protection ratio is indicates the amount of mar­
gin the signal can deliver above the associated RFI that falls within its bandwidth. A 
discussion of adjacent channel and out-of-band RFI is provided later in this chapter. 
These relationships are illustrated in the spectrum in Figure 6.1.
The definition and basic application of C/I, or protection ratio, was covered 
in Section 3.4. For those less familiar with the detailed meaning and use of C/I, we 
provide the following review. We must know the total power of the desired power, 
which can be determined from its unmodulated (CW) state before modulation, or 
after modulation by integrating the power across the bandwidth of the signal. In ei­
ther case, the power is measured in watts, or equivalently dBW or dBm, depending 
on the approach used in the design and analysis of the radiocommunication system. 
The power of the interfering signal is determined in the same manner; if the signal 
is unknown, then its power can be estimated by multiplying the maximum power 
spectral density (PSD) of the interference, N0, by the bandwidth of the desired sig­
nal, B. It is a common practice to substitute the symbol rate, Rs, for the bandwidth 
because it represents an average bandwidth or, more precisely, the noise equivalent 
bandwidth. The value of I is again in watts, or using the decibel in dBW or dBm. 
Note that the C/I is the dimensionless ratio of powers in the case of true powers in 
watts, or the difference in dB, again dimensionless (being careful to avoid a 30-dB 
mistake by mixing dBW and dBm).
C/I can be converted into either Eb/N0 or Es/N0 in the following manner:

where R is the code rate and q is the number of phase and amplitude states of the

Figure 6.1 shows upper and lower adjacent channels that are contiguous with 
the symbol rate bandwidth of the desired carrier. While this is feasible for certain 
types of modulations, it is a common practice to allow for roll-off of the filter 
bandwidth and place the adjacent carriers accordingly. The roll-off factor, α, ac­
commodates the filtering along with providing control of intersymbol interference 
(ISI) in the demodulated signal.
When the RFI occupies less bandwidth than the desired carrier, the value of I is 
simply the total power of the interfering carrier. We treat this just like the equiva­
lent amount of noise from a broadband interferer within the same bandwidth (i.e., 
N0B). This is a reasonable and perhaps conservative assumption for conventional 
digital demodulators of the type discussed in Chapter 2. Certain radio systems, par­
ticularly radar, behave differently due to their pulsed nature, as discussed in Section 
3.3 . We present an example later in this chapter.
Another special case arose regarding interference from a wideband FM car­
rier sweeping across a narrow-band digital transmission using a technique known 
as single channel per carrier (SCPC). The case is described in Section 7.5.2 as an 
Figure 6.1  General relationship of carrier to interference, both in band and in the adjacent channel. Inter­
ference that occupies a bandwidth greater than the desired signal can usually be treated as noise, which is 
shown as a constant power spectral density. The C/I is the ratio of desired power (under the matched filter 
curve) divided by the noise in the same equivalent bandwidth.

previous assumptions about a narrow or unmodulated carrier have the same effect 
on BER as an equivalent amount of thermal noise in the receiver bandwidth. Basi­
cally, the BER increased only during the time that the interfering carrier was within 
the victim demodulator bandwidth; conversely, when the carrier swept outside of 
this bandwidth, the BER returned to its uninterfered-with state. 
Many radiocommunication systems are subject to multiple sources of interfer­
ence in addition to the thermal noise present within the system itself. A methodol­
ogy for adding noise and interference powers is discussed in Chapter 4, wherein 
each interference “entry” is treated as an independent source that can be added on 
a power basis with thermal noise to produce a total value of C/(N+I).
6.1  C/I Criteria
One of the more complex and potentially contentious areas of RFI investigation 
and mitigation is the issue of the proper value of C/I to be used. As stated above, 
there are often multiple RFI entries and associated sources, and each may need to be 
evaluated individually. Then, the total must be considered against what is produced 
at the input to every demodulator on the receiving end. We can look at this in terms 
of the worst case which produces the lowest possible value of C/I. If a given system 
is not affected by the worst case RFI, then all is well. On the other hand, it is often 
the situation that most receivers will operate effectively but perhaps a limiting or 
even nonexistent case may end up driving the study and ultimately be the bone of 
contention between the parties involved. In the latter case, more study and measure­
ment is probably called for as there are likely to be answers that allow the victim 
and interfering systems to coexist. This is, after all, the ultimate objective of RFI 
investigation and resolution.
A good example of how a worst case analysis is used as an initial filter for de­
termining if there could be unacceptable RFI is the approach within ITU regulation 
of geostationary satellites. ITU member administrations should assign frequencies 
to operators within their borders (or under their jurisdiction) in a way that doesn’t 
cause unacceptable interference to the operation of an existing system in another 
country. The Advance Publication of Information (API) initial stage of obtaining a 
satellite orbital location is described in Article 9, Section 1, of the Radio Regula­
tions [1]. An administration is required to compile technical information about the 
planned satellite and Earth station network and provide this to the ITU for review 
and publication to all administrations. From there, the data are used by other ad­
ministrations to determine the potential for unacceptable RFI using the technique 
described in Appendix 8. Boiling this all down, the methodology provides a worst 
case assessment of how much the total received noise in the victim receiver will 
be increased by the maximum possible power spectral density in that system that 
could be produced by operation of the new entrant. The threshold is set at 6%, 
which is equivalent to an offending C/I which is 12 dB higher than the total C/N of 
the victim system. The latter is derived for a link operating with the planned C/N 
(with margin) while the former corresponds to the highest possible power spectral 
density, assumed to exist at the same frequency. As a result, the threshold C/I would 
probably be a relatively high value (making the coordination threshold low). The 

118 
�������������������������������������������������������
Interference Protection Ratio (C/I) and Its Application
6% threshold is not used as an allowable level but only as a trigger to determine if 
detailed frequency coordination based on thorough C/I analysis is required.
Terrestrial radio systems tend to interfere with each other in more complex 
ways than do satellites (because the range is shorter and propagation is more com­
plex). Spectrum is divided up among operators in a particular geographic area, 
and RFI can be expected in transition regions. Also, short term propagation can 
extend the distance and mechanisms that need to be considered. This is why com­
plex propagation models like Longley-Rice are popular and yet RFI occurs on a 
fairly routine basis. Owing to the ability of W-CDMA to withstand such RFI, the 
complexity has generally been manageable in terrestrial wireless. Part of this is the 
adaptive nature of these systems: a sudden increase in RFI is automatically miti­
gated through changes in MODCOD, data rate, and allowed access.
6.1.1  Calculation of Static Values
We start with the assumption that the RFI is noise-like and can be added to the 
thermal and other noise power prior to arrival at the receiver. This will apply in the 
majority of cases; however, RFI of an unusual nature requires careful inspection 
and evaluation (time-varying RFI is considered in a later section of this chapter and 
Chapter 7 as well). Common noise-like RFI is illustrated in Figure 6.2 for three 
cases: pure thermal noise (Gaussian white noise), narrowband RFI, and wideband 
RFI. The thermal noise case was addressed in Chapter 3 and will treated as a given 
since all radiocommunication systems are subject to it. The narrowband and wide­
band cases are treated next.
6.1.1.1  Protection Margin in Narrowband RFI
A constant interfering carrier that resides within the bandwidth of the victim carrier 
(and its associated receiver bandwidth) is considered to be a narrowband RFI case. 
This ranges from an unmodulated (CW) signal up to one that occupies the total 
receiver bandwidth. It is typically assumed that the demodulator filter can suppress 
Figure 6.2  The desired carrier with thermal noise (constant spectral density, N0), a narrowband interfering 
carrier, and a wideband interfering carrier.

6.1  C/I Criteria

out-of-band signals, including RFI, by 30 dB. We discuss a case in Section 6.4.2 
where such filtering is not provided due to cost economies. What we are interested 
in is the total RFI carrier power integrated across this bandwidth, and we treat that 
as a like amount of thermal noise. For a reasonably large quantity of narrowband 
interferers, we simply add their power together to produce the total interference 
power, I, and take the ratio of C/I that results. Multiple interfering carriers are 
bounded by the maximum quantity of these that can be present at the same time. 
The relationship of these RFI carriers to the noise floor (assumed to account for in­
ternal noise of the victim radiocommunication system) also needs to be considered. 
An exception to this rule can occur when there is only one or possibly a few CW in­
terference sources that produces a high instantaneous peak voltage. Under this con­
dition, the carrier recovery loop of the demodulator, covered in Chapter 2, could 
experience a loss of lock and data lost as a result. The RFI in this case would have 
to be quite strong in relation to the thermal noise present in the receiving system.
A simple calculation illustrates how interference entries influence the overall 
link, and how the choice of C/I per entry can be a very critical design parameter. 
Figure 6.2 was created using the following equation for total C/N as a function of 
individual interfering signals within the same bandwidth:

where C/Nth is the thermal C/N (excluding any interference entries) and C/I is the 
ratio of carrier to total interference power in the bandwidth of the carrier. Note that 
these are true values and not in dB. This expression gives us the necessary value of 
C/Nth before interference is included and for a specific desired value of link C/N. 
If that value of C/N is assume to be 10 dB, Figure 6.3 presents the relationship be­
tween C/Nth and C/I per entry, for cases of a single RFI entry (N = 1) and 10 RFI 
entries (N = 10). We use the simple mathematical model which assumes that noise 
and interference can be added on a power basis, which is justified in the common 
case of independent signals. The graphs are presented in terms of dB, allowing us to 
look over a relatively wide range of C/Nth (10 to 15 dB) and C/I per RFI entry (10 
to 35 dB). A review of the two curves in Figure 6.3 can be very instructive about the 
interplay of basic link characteristics in the presence of noise and RFI. The lower 
curve assumes one entry while the upper (dotted) curve assumes 10 RFI entries. On 
a simple basis with RFI entries that are of equal power but uncorrelated (i.e., from 
independent sources), each of the ten entries can only be one tenth the power (e.g., 
C/I 10 dB greater) than the case of the single RFI entry. As a general rule, the more 
entries, the higher the C/I per entry must be (because they add on a power basis to 
produce an effective total C/I reduced by 10 log10(N), where N is the number of 
entries). Stated another way, the two curves are separated by the same 10 log10(N), 
which is 10 dB in this example.
The case of N = 1 will come about where there is a single interference source 
degrading service; it is addressed by increasing link C/N in the absence of RFI to the 

120

Interference Protection Ratio (C/I) and Its Application
amount shown on the X-axis corresponding to the value of C/I on the Y-axis. For 
example, an RFI condition of C/I = 20 dB with one entry (N = 1)  requires that the 
link operate at a C/Nth greater than or equal to 10.5 dB (assuming the combined 
link C/N = 10 dB). This would require a nominal increase of 0.5 dB in link power, 
or about 10%.  On the other hand, the condition of C/I = 13 dB requires a 3 dB 
increase in C/Nth to the same value of 13 dB. This is expected since both the power 
of the RFI and the noise in the bandwidth of the carrier are equal, resulting in a 
combined C/N that is 3 dB less than either. The asymptotic nature of the graph to 
the right indicates that one cannot allow a C/I approaching 10 dB, for which the 
thermal noise would have to be zero in power terms (or –∞ in dB).
Taking a look at the dotted curve for 10  RFI entries, the C/I of each must be 
10 dB greater than for the N = 1 example below it. The horizontal line presents 
how a C/N = 10 dB can be achieved with C/I = 21 dB for both conditions. However, 
the C/Nth would have to be about 5 dB greater to accommodate 10 such carriers. 
This seems like a good trade because 10 dB in RFI can be accommodated with only 
about 5 dB of carrier power, which is a factor of about 3 (rather than 10). The rea­
son for this is the presence of the thermal noise in the link which helps compensate 
for RFI. All of this discussion is meant to provide some insight into the practical 
relationships between these critical variables. These values interact in the manner 
presented and the analyst must examine all cases that can arise for a particular 
system.
There is a special case for multiple RFI carriers if they are unmodulated (CW). 
Pure sinusoids when added together can produce peaks in voltage and hence power

that can overdrive receiving devices that lack sufficient dynamic range. For exam­
ple, two CW interferers if equal in power cause peak values according to the square 
of the voltage (i.e., 6 dB). On the other hand, if the RFI signals are modulated as 
they would be if they contained digital data, then the summation used in Figure 6.2 
will be appropriate. Section 6.4 provides a real example of RFI that is Gaussian 
noise, CW, and pulsed or swept,
6.1.1.2  Protection Margin in Wideband RFI
We can extend this to the case of wideband RFI by simply recognizing that we 
need only consider the RFI power that falls within the bandwidth of the victim 
carrier (and hence passes through its demodulator filter). The simple approach is 
to determine the power spectral density of the interference and multiply that by 
the bandwidth of the victim carrier; this yields the appropriate value of interfer­
ence power, I. In the case of CDMA using direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS), 
use this wideband RFI approach for the victim carrier, assumed to have narrower 
bandwidth as illustrated in Figure 6.1.  However, if all signals employ CDMA over 
the same bandwidth, then we have the situation contemplated in Figure 6.2 and 
multiple CDMA signals add to produce a total noise “floor” that can exceed the 
thermal noise. De-spreading of the desired carrier will provide an effective C/N that 
is increased by jamming margin, 10 log10(N), where N is the number of simultane­
ous CDMA signals. But, 10 log10(N) is also the contribution of multiple RFI car­
riers within the same passband and the jamming margin is thusly consumed. This 
assumes that all spread spectrum signals are equal in power spectral density, a con­
dition that is very difficult (if not impossible) to maintain in a real CDMA system. 
Any degree of power imbalance, due to imperfect power control, will transfer into 
higher noise and a loss of capacity.
Figure 6.4 presents one example of the effect of imperfect power control on the 
capability of a CDMA network. The measure shown is the frame error rate (FER), 
or the number of received frames in error divided by the total frames transmitted. 
FER is related to BER in that it is always a higher rate by a factor approximately 
equal to the number of bits in the frame. This is only presented as an illustration 
and should not be used in assessing the specific performance of a given system. The 
lower curve is for the case with ideal power control, indicating a generally declining 
FER as a function of Eb/N0. However, even just 1 dB of power control error results 
in nearly an order of magnitude increase in FER, and a flat or constant character­
istic as Eb/N0 rises above about 4 dB.
Generally speaking, if a mobile transmitter is adjusted so that the C/I received 
at the base station is at a minimal acceptable level, the capacity of the system is 
maximized [3]. Any increase in mobile power raises the interference in the sys­
tem, and capacity is compromised. Line-of-sight conditions and short ranges with 
small delays allow for the most precise power control, including the use of a closed 
loop system. Fading on satellite and mobile links introduces a strong random vari­
able that tends to counter attempts at precise power control. We already presented 
examples of how Rayleigh fades can exceed 20 dB when the user is exposed to 
blockage. Many CDMA systems use a combination of closed-loop and open-loop 
power control. For the latter, the measured signal power from the base station 
indicates degradation in the mobile channel caused by blockage. The system can 

122

Interference Protection Ratio (C/I) and Its Application
help accommodate this fade by increasing transmit power, thus raising the Eb/N0 
at the base station. However, as more stations employ this strategy, the total power 
radiated increases as does the interference. The system tends quickly toward over­
load and capacity drops rapidly. Alternatives to this involve complex strategies that 
group users according to common properties, and grant priorities based on service 
levels and the like. Dynamic adjustment of MODCOD and throughput are also 
prevalent and effective countermeasures.
6.1.2  Antenna Characteristics and Isolation
Antennas offer isolation from RFI to the extent that their radiation patterns sup­
press signals received or transmitted. Generalized principles of antenna design and 
performance were covered in Chapter 2. In this section, we examine various ap­
proaches to RFI analysis and control in the far field of the antenna. Obviously, this 
is based on the two key properties of antennas: directivity and polarization. Figure 
2.14 provides a standard coordinate system for antenna radiation; this is refined 
using various cuts or projections taken along different axes, such as those shown 
in Figure 2.15. 
Figure 6.5 gives an example of the simple case of interference from a single 
antenna radiator into another operating antenna pointed in a different direction. 
We will assume that the paths are all line of sight, which should yield worst case 
interference to the antenna on the right. The two antennas are assumed to be dif­
ferent, which is the case if they operate in totally different systems. The protection 
ratio, or C/I, is obtained using the radiation patterns for the specific antenna gain 
values in the directions where interference will be produced. The numerator, C, is

computed using a link budget for the desired system (discussed in Chapter 4), while 
I is computed for the path taken by the interference. The following equation is used 
to represent the interference, where the primes (‘) indicate interference (I) source

The illustration and equation are deceptively simple since only a few parame­

, is a simple step and yields a very accurate value (based only on 
knowledge of the frequency or wavelength, and the distance). What we have not 
considered so far are the propagation characteristics involved in the paths for both 
C and I. The gains, G(θ) and G′(θ′) for the victim and interfering antennas, respec­
tively, are in directions that correspond to their paths of interference coupling. The 
respective sidelobes of these antennas are effectively opposite each other, yielding 
a transmission path not unlike one for actual communications. Before we can ad­
dress suppression of this path of distance R′, we must understand its nature and 
constituents.
6.2  Non-Steady State Propagation: Scatter, Rain-Induced Interference, 
Ionospheric Conditions 
At this point, we consider the various propagation characteristics covered in Chap­
ters 4 and 5. Calculation of RFI levels and effects will need to reflect the time-varying 
aspects of propagation, the majority of which introduce attenuation. Therefore, RFI 
will generally be reduced by such non-steady state propagation factors, including 
Figure 6.5  Example of interference geometry involving one source of interference.

124 
�������������������������������������������������������
Interference Protection Ratio (C/I) and Its Application
rain attenuation (at frequencies above approximately 5 GHz), ionospheric scintil­
lation (for space-to-ground links at frequencies below approximately 8 GHz), and 
tropospheric ducting and scintillation. Scattering of waves by the atmosphere can 
cause RFI to propagate into locations not reached by line of sight; a good example 
of this is tropospheric scatter transmission, which was discussed in Section 4.2.5 
as a method of providing communications beyond the horizon. Also, ducting can 
introduce RFI at microwave frequencies along paths measured in hundreds or thou­
sands of kilometers typically over seawater. 
Appendix 7 of the ITU Radio Regulations gives detailed procedures for esti­
mating these various losses to establish conditions under which RFI from an earth 
station in one country can propagate into the territory of another. This approach 
was developed over 40 years ago to assist with terrestrial coordination of fixed 
service stations with Earth stations in the fixed satellite service. The calculations, 
defined in Appendix 7, can be performed by software provided by the ITU to its 
member administrations. The output is given in terms of the minimum required 
distance from a transmitting earth station, called the coordination distance, to pro­
vide protection for terrestrial stations potentially in range of RFI. Typically conser­
vatively determined, it is used as a trigger to determine if the earth station must be 
coordinated with terrestrial stations the might receive RFI in a neighboring coun­
try. A microwave station in the fixed service is referred to as a terrestrial station. 
Two modes of propagation are evaluated: (1) for a great circle path (smooth Earth) 
and (2) for scattering in the troposphere primarily by rain and mist. According to 
this formulation that defines the minimum acceptable propagation loss, Lb(p):

this value must be exceeded by the propagation mode (1) predicted path loss for all 
but p% of the time

station

source
Gt: gain (dB relative to isotropic) of the antenna of the transmitting terrestrial 
station or earth station. 
For a transmitting Earth station, this is the antenna gain toward the physical 
horizon on a given azimuth; for a transmitting terrestrial station, the maximum 
main beam axis antenna gain is to be used.
Gr: gain (dB relative to isotropic) of the antenna of the receiving terrestrial or 
Earth station that may be subject to interference. For a receiving Earth station, this

is the gain toward the physical horizon on a given azimuth; for a receiving terres­
trial station, the maximum main beam axis antenna gain is to be used. In the case 
of a receiving Earth station, the permissible interference power Pr(p) is specified 
with respect to the actual percentage of time the receiver is in operation, rather 
than the total elapsed time.
For propagation mode (2), a volume scattering process is involved and a modi­
fication of the above approach is necessary. Where the coordinating earth station 
antenna beam intersects a rain cell, a common volume may be formed with a ter­
restrial station beam or an earth station beam (operating in the opposite direction 
of transmission in bidirectionally allocated frequency bands). In the case of a ter­
restrial station, the assumptions are made that the terrestrial station beamwidth is 
relatively large in comparison with that of the coordinating earth station and that 
the terrestrial station is some distance from the common volume. The terrestrial 
station beam is therefore assumed to illuminate the whole rain cell, which is repre­
sented by a vertical cylinder filled with hydrometeors that give rise to isotropically 
scattered signals. This scattering process may give rise to unwanted coupling be­
tween the coordinating Earth station and terrestrial stations or other Earth stations 
operating in bidirectionally allocated frequency bands, via the common volume.
6.3  Service Performance in the Presence of Interference
The bottom line in radiocommunication is determined by the quality of service 
delivered to end users. Therefore, our study must consider all of the previously dis­
cussed and analyzed factors whereby RFI impacts transmission throughout a period 
of service. Consider variables such as propagation (of the desired victim carrier and 
of the RFI itself), the dynamics of transmission activity, especially how various sig­
nals get loaded and unloaded over time, and the behavior of the users themselves. 
Principles of how interference affects service quality can be summarized as 
follows:
••
Fundamentally, BER has an inverse relationship with the total value of C/N 
in the bandwidth of the carrier. Service quality in digital services is directly 
related to the BER, as well as packet error rate (PER). Established values and 
curves of this performance are available for commercial modem products 
and wireless systems that employ them. The C/N must be maintained high 
enough so that BER is satisfactory; a drop in C/N from this threshold condi­
tion will result in reduced data throughput and loss of link synchronization.
••
C/I is combined with link C/N without interference using the approach given 
in 6.1.1. The resulting value of C/(N+I) will determine the BER for the link.
••
There are aspects of link quality and reliability that go beyond simple BER 
prediction. Pulsed or sweeping RFI need to be considered based on the tim­
ing of the pulse or sweep (i.e., the temporal characteristics) along with its 
impact on actual receivers and demodulators. The case of radar interference, 
covered in Section 6.4.1, is a good example. Another example is provided in 
Section 7.5.2 for SCPC satellite communications with swept FM interference.

126 
�������������������������������������������������������
Interference Protection Ratio (C/I) and Its Application
We can do a reasonable job of predicting the protection ratio in a given case, 
using methods discussed earlier in this chapter. From there, the impact on service 
quality and reliability may be assessed analytically or by experiment. The former 
requires a body of knowledge that addresses service quality versus C/I, considering 
the relative bandwidth of I versus the C (see Section 6.1). For a new combination 
of modulation and coding, such knowledge needs to be developed, for which some 
examples are given in the next section.
Thinking about the temporal aspects suggested in a previous paragraph, RFI 
can appear suddenly, along with an unexpected service impairment or disruption. 
These are fairly difficult to deal with as they typically are not in the design or plan 
for the system. From there, it becomes the detective mystery problem that we cov­
ered in Section 1.4 and again in Section 8.4.
6.4  Interference Among Various Systems
We can discuss RFI and its impact in abstract, but it is probably more instructive 
to look at some real systems and the interference situations they have faced. RFI is 
a part of how typical radiocommunication systems are designed, implemented and 
operated. These examples provide a jumping-off place for looking at systems that 
differ in important ways; however, the principles as discussed previously do not 
change.
6.4.1  Radars vs. Land Mobile Systems
Evaluating RFI that can exist between a radar and a land mobile radiocommunica­
tion system involves a two-way street. Radar poses either a swept or pulsed inter­
ference source, as covered in Section 3.3, and the impact requires that its temporal 
nature be considered carefully. One the other hand, transmissions from wireless 
communications devices have the potential to produce false readings on radar dis­
plays. The former was the subject of a detailed study and test program conducted 
by the U.S. National Telecommunication and Information Agency (NTIA), which is 
reviewed in this section [4]. The particular land mobile service is Long-Term Evolu­
tion (LTE), also known as 4G cellular. The impact of radar on another radiocom­
munication service would require its own investigation, potentially of this order. In 
the other direction, radar systems are listening over a fairly wide bandwidth and 
are subject to interference primarily when the radar antenna is aligned with the in­
terfering radio source, such as an antenna on a tower, vehicle or earth station. This 
produces radial lines called “strobes” on the pulse-position indicator (PPI) of the 
radar display device.
NTIA evaluated protection ratios and performance for radar interference into 
LTE wireless systems, based on radar transmitters on naval vessels. This is illustrat­
ed in Figure 6.6 given in the report [4]. To maximize coverage, LTE-enhanced Node 
B (eNB) base station antennas are typically situated at high locations such as at the 
tops of towers or building rooftops and, therefore, have a higher probability of 
receiving radar interference. User equipment (UE), such as personal smart phones 
and vehicular terminals, would be protected by terrain blockage and smooth earth 
attenuation due to their reduced height. However, UE terminals on hilltops and in 

6.4  Interference Among Various Systems 
127
aircraft could easily experience RFI similar to that received by the eNB illustrated 
in Figure 6.6.
NTIA provides the following insight into the RFI-producing characteristics of 
radar (discussed in Section 3.3).
Traditional (legacy) long range air-search radar waveforms often use pulse 
widths (PWs) that are between 1 and 10 μs long, at PRRs of between 300 and 
1,000 pulses/sec. The transmitted waveform duty cycle (DC, defined as time inter­
val during which waveform power is transmitted divided by total time of the wave­
form’s periodicity) of such radars is about 0.1 percent. Such radars use tube-type 
output devices (e.g., magnetrons, klystrons, crossed-field amplifiers) that generate 
effective isotropic radiated peak power levels (peak EIRP) of 1–10 GW (90 to 100 
dBW). Newer radars often use solid-state output devices radiating peak EIRPs of 
10–100 MW (70 to 80 dBW), but at the cost of longer PWs and higher DCs that 
can approach 10%. The longer PWs of current and future solid state radars re­
quire, in turn, that transmitted pulses be frequency-modulated or phase coded to 
maintain adequate range resolution. Solid-state radars can cause more interference 
than higher-power tube-transmitter radars because the peak EIRPs of the newer ra­
dars are still high enough to exceed interference thresholds for many systems, while 
their higher DCs of around 10 percent have more impact in the time domain than 
the 0.1 percent DCs of older radars. Radar pulses were modeled as either fixed-
frequency carrier waves, designated by NTIA as [an unmodulated pulse sequence 
containing no information] P0N or [an angle-modulated carrier with a single chan­
nel but containing no information, e.g., chirping] Q3N [5].
The investigation centered on actual testing of radar interference into the 
aforementioned LTE base station. The radar interference waveform parameter 
space was designed to span the entire range of all existing and possible fu­
ture radar waveforms that do/may occur in 3.5-GHz band. Measurements in­
cluded LTE data throughput, block error rate (BLER), and modulation and coding 
scheme (MODCOD) usage for both the downlink and uplink, and additionally UE 
transmit power and resource block (RB) usage for the uplink. Each RB represents a 
block of bandwidth equal to 180 kHz which is dynamically assignable by the eNB. 
These diagnostics were recorded for a wide range of interference power levels, I, 
by varying the interference duty cycle (DC) values in an approximately logarithmic 
progression: 1%, 3%, and 10%. Pulse width (PW) and pulse repetition rate (PRR) 
values were adjusted to achieve these DCs. For the P0N pulses, setting DC was

straightforward: DC = PW ∙ PRR. The P0N pulses were centered at 3,600 MHz for 
the downlink testing and 3,520 MHz for the uplink testing. Two additional P0N 
tests were performed on the downlink path at +2 MHz and +4 MHz offsets from 
3,600 MHz (3,602 MHz and 3,604 MHz, respectively). The target value of BLER 
was 10%.
Measured spectra for the carrier transmitted by the base station (eNB down­
link) is shown in Figure 6.7 under peak and average conditions. The spectrum is 
similar to Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) emission 
spectra presented in a recent NTIA Report [5], which employ orthogonal frequency 
division multiplex (OFDM). It is also noted that the spectrum is from a prototype 
3.5-GHz LTE eNB.
The emission spectrum structure of the LTE UE transmitter, as measured with 
both peak and average detection, is shown in Figure 6.8. While the UE transmis­
sion is centered at f0 = 3,520 MHz, the lowest (in frequency) 10 resource blocks 
(RBs) were unused, leaving only the upper 40 RBs active. As each RB is 180 kHz 
wide, the total occupied bandwidth of the emission spectrum of the UE is 7.2 MHz, 
causing the center of the intentional emissions to appear to be at 3,520.9 MHz. It 
should be noted that in the presence of interference, this spectrum can change dra­
matically as the UE changes the number of RBs in use. A change in RBs will change 
the total occupied bandwidth of the UE emission spectrum

where BW is the total emission bandwidth, RB is the number of resource blocks in

Steady-state interference shows the effects of Gaussian noise interference and 
radar waveform interference on the LTE UE receiver (downlink) data throughput

to noise of 22.5 dB with no interference, which is essentially standard industry 
practice.
Figure 6.9 presents the results of measurements made under the condition of 
continuous (Gaussian noise) interference in a band 10 MHz wide (essentially the 
UE bandwidth). The nominal operating conditions without interference were a 
received signal power of –75 dBm with a thermal noise power of –98.4 dBm. For 
each datapoint on each graph, the circle indicates the mean throughput or BLER 
as calculated from all of the data samples recorded by diagnostic software for each 
interference waveform power level. The number of samples used to calculate mean 
and standard deviation was approximately 100 for throughput and over 2,000 for 
BLER. The error bars associated with each point show the standard deviation from 
the mean. In the figure, a smoothing spline was used to demonstrate general trends 
for both throughput and BLER. These data indicate the complexity of both the 
measurement and the results, providing a challenge to anyone trying to make gen­
eral conclusions. For example, the downlink throughput declines from 45 Mbps to 
near zero as the Gaussian noise interference increases from –90 dBm to –75 dBm 
(5 dB greater than the carrier) while BLER is held constant at 10%. However, they 
point to the behavior of a dynamic system like LTE under steady-state interference. 
The results on service for a true pulsed radar signal are presented in Figure 
6.10. On first examination, the sets of curves appear to be very similar, leading one 
to possibly conclude the radar interference appears to the UE receiver about the 
same as constant Gaussian noise. However, an examination of the horizontal axis, 
which presents average received interference power, indicates that there is as much 
as a 40-dB difference (a factor of 10,000 in power), rendering the pulsed interfer­
ence to have substantially less impact of service for the same service quality. This is 
actually a result of the fact that the interference duty cycle is only 1%.
One must be careful, however, not to make a definitive conclusion based on a 
couple of cases. Figure 6.11 presents a case of a swept-frequency carrier wave pulse

modulation (called chirped radar and designated Q3N) into the LTE UE receiver 
where the BLER blows up to greater than 50% in a 20 dB range of interference 
power. This unexpected behavior could not be explained by the authors from the 
data and must relate to the specifics of link dynamics and modem design. This 
would require detailed investigation of receiver properties, which was not part of 
the investigation.
Measurements were also conducted in the uplink direction, where the UT is the 
transmitter and the eNB base station is the receiver. The system is very dynamic and 
adaptive in nature, so the best measure is how throughput is maintained during RFI 
exposure. The received signal level at the eNB was –85 dBm. Figure 6.12 presents 
the case with wideband Gaussian noise interference while Figure 6.13 presents the 
case with swept radar-type interference (Q3N), again displaying a substantial ad­
vantage for chirped interference as compared to continuous noise. With Gaussian 
noise, throughput measured in RB transfer falls off when interference exceeds -80 
dBm; while it does not vary with chirped radar even as the interference exceeds -30 
dBm.
The NTIA concluded that theoretical analysis is recommended to better un­
derstand why various radar interference waveforms have the particular effects that 
have been published in this report. LTE signal detection needs to be understood to 
perform such analyses. We learn a lot about how the radiocommunication system 
behaves in the presence of the expected RFI environment. Clearly, LTE and radar 
in the same band have significant sharing problems. The challenge remains to com­
pletely understand what is going on and how the system will respond when oper­
ating in a live environment. Sharing concepts for future systems are presented in

6.4.2  Protection of GPS from Terrestrial Wireless Systems 
Radiocommunication presents an ever-changing environment in which new tech­
nologies and systems are introduced while older, legacy systems remain in wide­
spread service. One of the best examples of this kind of interplay involved the 
now-pervasive and all-essential Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) system, owned 
and operated by the U.S. Government but used by billions of devices on the Earth, 
seas, and skies, and even in space. There is great potential for interference to the 
myriad of standalone devices with nondirectional antennas and chips embedded 
in almost anything that needs position or location data. These devices work well 
enough using signals from GPS satellites in space to compute location and other 
data, and employ a dedicated piece of spectrum between 1,559 and 1,591 MHz, 
a bandwidth of 32 MHz. Protection is afforded by its primary status and lack of 
other users in this band. Out-of-band transmissions that are powerful and close 
enough in frequency (especially in an adjacent higher or lower band), however, 
can produce some form of receiver overload and desensitization. The problem is 
mitigated by having good bandpass filtering on the GPS user device, as well as re­
stricting the power and location of out-of-band transmitters that pose a threat. This 
problem came to a head in connection with an innovative idea called Ancillary Ter­
restrial Component (ATC), advanced by LightSquared, Inc., of the United States. 
ATC, illustrated in Figure 6.14 and discussed below, would reuse MSS spectrum by 
terrestrial base stations. Note that LightSquared was formerly known as Mobile 
Satellite Ventures (MSV), which held an L-band MSS license and obtained FCC 
authority to implement ATC.

Interference Protection Ratio (C/I) and Its Application
6.4.2.1  MSS Spectrum Made Available for Terrestrial Wireless Services
The U.S. FCC had allowed a US-MSS operator, LightSquared, to reuse its MSS 
satellite spectrum in a terrestrial wireless network that employs conventional base 
station towers and user equipment that could operate in the MSS L-band frequency 
range. The relationship among the spectrum assignments for MSS and GPS is pre­
sented in Figure 6.15. LightSquared planned to employ the prevalent fourth-gener­
ation cellular standard known as LTE for their terrestrial network and stated their 
intention to always operate base stations at least 4 MHz separated from the start of 
the GPS L1 band (1,559 MHz). There was no regulatory requirement to maintain 
this guardband, however, nor did LightSquared’s MSS ATC authorization impose 
such a restriction [8]. In addition, the FCC authorization permitted use of ATC 
power levels as much as 10 dB in excess of what LightSquared intended to use and, 
as a consequence, tests could not be conducted at the maximum allowable ATC 
levels. At these allowable higher levels, there may be additional deleterious effects, 
such as intermodulation products caused by ATC emissions.
6.4.2.2  Assessing RFI from MSS into GPS: Technical and Business Issues
An independent technical working group (TWG) examined the performance of GPS 
receivers in the presence of LightSquared’s terrestrial operations [9]. The TWG 
testing, discussed in detail in the TWG Report, shows a wide range of individual 
GPS receiver performance, illustrating conclusively that the problem is one of GPS 
device design and characteristics, rather than an issue of fundamental incompatibil­
ity between LightSquared’s planned transmissions and all GPS receivers. The tested 
GPS receivers had varying abilities to reject LightSquared’s transmissions depend­
ing, as expected, on the nature of the filtering employed in the receivers as well as 
other aspects of receiver design.
Although the results vary among devices, the overall conclusion of the test­
ing is that transmissions in the upper 10-MHz channel—the channel nearest to 
the 1,559-1,610-MHz GPS band—would adversely affect the performance of a

acteristics of GPS Receivers in Proximity to LightSquared’s L-Band Terrestrial Base Stations (BTS) and

significant number of legacy GPS receivers. The tests confirm that this problem is 
not caused by emissions from LightSquared’s base stations into the GPS band, but 
from the failure of these legacy GPS receivers to reject transmissions from Light­
Squared’s licensed frequencies, which are adjacent to the spectrum allocated for use 
by GPS. Ultimately, the FCC pulled the ATC authorization, and LightSquared was 
unable to introduce terrestrial services using MSS spectrum.
6.5  Satellite Communications vs. Terrestrial Microwave Systems
The FSS was established before 1965 using C-band (6-GHz uplink and 4-GHz 
downlink) to provide spectrum for introduction of long-distance satellite commu­
nications between fixed locations on Earth. It allowed the establishment of the 
global system originally known as the International Telecommunications Satellite 
Consortium (INTELSAT), a joint-venture organization owned by major public and 
private telecommunications operators in the respective countries that INTELSAT 
interconnected. The particular spectrum provided by the ITU for this service previ­
ously had been allocated to the terrestrial Fixed Service (FS), which basically was 
for point-to-point microwave links of the same operators. The FSS was co-primary 
with FS, which is to say that the spectrum was to be shared.
The forced partnering of FSS and FS of necessity introduced requirements for 
coordination, the complicated ITU process to identify and resolve international 
conflicts between radiocommunication services that result from RFI. Many rules 
were put in place to manage the interference:
••
Space to Earth,
••
Earth to Space, and
••
Earth to Earth.
The approach depends on the use of fixed locations that are coordinated and li­
censed by the respective nations. To control interference, C-band Earth stations had 
to be located in remote places that had isolation from terrestrial microwave links. 
This system worked fairly well but tended to hinder application of space commu­
nications, until an unshared Ku-band allocation arrived on the scene around 1972. 
An important and often-challenging aspect deals with the coordination of the satel­
lites themselves. From 1965 through the time of this writing, geostationary satel­
lites have been the foundation, and these have the benefit of being fixed in relation 
to Earth and to one another. Consequently, coordination amounts to adequately 
defining how a given satellite is to be used and what RFI it will cause and receive 
with its neighbors when put into use (moved into the assigned orbit longitude and 
turned on so it can relay signals from the ground). 
These procedures are laid out in Article 9 of the ITU Radio Regulations and 
conducted by the Radio Regulations Board of the ITU in Geneva, Switzerland. We 
will not go into the details of these regulations nor about how nations and their 
respective satellite operators interact on formal and informal bases. Suffice it to say 
that the process favors established operators who have a presumption of the ability 
to replace satellites as they reach end of life, but for which careful following of the 

136 
�������������������������������������������������������
Interference Protection Ratio (C/I) and Its Application
rules is mandatory. A new operator will face challenges in finding a usable orbit 
longitude (slot) and completing this process in time to launch the first satellite into 
orbit. This is probably why potential new entrants are focusing their attention on 
nongeostationary satellite orbit (NGSO) satellite systems or constellations operat­
ing in the low Earth orbit (LEO) and medium Earth orbit (MEO) regimes.
The classical example of an NGSO would be the Iridium system, implemented 
by Motorola in the 1990s using 66 LEO satellites in a near-polar orbit at an alti­
tude of 780 km. To proceed with Iridium, Motorola required a dedicated piece of 
spectrum allocated by the ITU and subsequently assigned to them on a sole-user 
basis by the FCC. To do the latter, the FCC segmented the band to give them ap­
proximately 8 MHz and like amount to their main competitor, a joint venture of 
Loral Space and Communications and Qualcomm. The MSS band in question is in 
proximity to the same segment of L-band used by LightSquared and GPS; their re­
spective protection is again provided by having adequate frequency separation and 
controls on power. Coordination with any terrestrial uses of this spectrum were 
nearly unnecessary as few if an existed at the time of introduction. One major ex­
ception was for Radio Astronomy (RA) also using a proximate band but sensitive 
to out-or-band emissions from space. A protocol was established wherein Iridium 
would not exceed a certain specified flux density in areas populated by radio tele­
scopes like Greenbank, WV. Iridium satellite operation was automated in such a 
way that the appropriate beam was throttled when a satellite was in view of this 
area of the ground.
The various RFI paths that can exist between Earth stations, satellites and ter­
restrial microwave stations is illustrated in Figure 6.16. The paths labeled (2) and 
(3) are addressed through the process of terrestrial coordination, discussed previ­
ously for Article 7 of the ITU Radio Regulations. Path (1), which is directly from 
the terrestrial microwave station to the satellite in orbit, is unlikely and in any case 
is addressed by the general rule that terrestrial microwave stations must not point 
their antennas at the geostationary arc. 
Section 5.3.1 provides a clear example of how RFI is introduced into an Earth 
station. In this example, the RFI is from a ship-board radar operating in an adjacent 
Figure 6.16  Interference between terrestrial microwave stations, and Earth station and a satellite.

frequency band. It produces front-end overload in the LNB and was cured using 
an RF filter. The situation with respect to a shared frequency band between FS 
and FSS, particularly C-band, demands more than filtering as the interference is 
generally within the passband of either the earth station LNB or the terrestrial 
microwave receiver.
RFI along Path (4), which is directly from the satellite into the terrestrial micro­
wave station, is controlled through a flux density limitation on satellite transmis­
sion to the earth. An example of such a limitation is presented in the set of formulas 
in Table 6.1 [10].
This somewhat obscure specification limits the power flux density on Earth’s 
surface, with the more severe limit toward the limb of the Earth (i.e., where a ter­
restrial microwave antenna might be pointed at a satellite near the local horizon). 
The two reference bandwidths consider the carrier bandwidth, further restricting 
the power spectral density. The variable Y in the second set of formulas is specified 
in a footnote to the table of frequency allocations:
The value of Y is defined as Y = 0 for max(NN, NS) ≤ 2; Y = 5 log(max(NN, 
NS)) for max(NN, NS) > 2, where NN is the maximum number of space stations in 
a system simultaneously transmitting on a cofrequency basis in the fixed-satellite 
service in the Northern Hemisphere, and NS is the maximum number of space sta­
tions in the same system simultaneously transmitting on a co-frequency basis in 
the fixed-satellite service in the Southern Hemisphere. In determining NN and NS, 
two space stations simultaneously transmitting during periods of short-duration 
handover shall be considered as one satellite.
We now address the local problem of RFI between an Earth station and one 
or more terrestrial microwave stations (i.e., paths (2) and (3), respectively). Figure 
6.17 illustrates the problem in terms of a terrain profile where the earth station is 
shielded to some extent by a hill or other obstacle. This is the general approach 
since radiation is diminished by blockage and diffraction loss. Section 5.1 addresses 
the theory and analysis of this aspect of RFI under an obstructed path.
While most of the INTELSAT C-band Earth stations were placed outside of 
urban areas, new entrants saw benefits for having teleport facilities in proximity 
to customers like cable TV networks and television producers. The teleport in Cul­
ver City, CA, was perhaps the first to construct and operate antennas right in the 
middle of an urban center. They exploited the isolation provided by tall buildings 
that blocked the path of offending microwave links, and placed their frequencies 
to be noninterfering.

Interference Protection Ratio (C/I) and Its Application
We have reviewed how protection ratio is assessed and applied in real-world 
RFI management. There is a methodical process here as it is a fairly straightfor­
ward matter of computing the values of C and I for each case, and assessing how 
the victim system responds to these disturbances. But, the complexity comes in 
when the situation is dynamic in terms of variation in carrier power and activity 
while the existence of RFI emitters may or may not be well understood. Add to this 
the variables associated with propagation and you have something that behaves 
more like the weather than electrical currents that obey Ohm’s law. It takes a good 
understanding of the radiocommunication system itself and the resources to dis­
cover the properties of the entire RFI environment, both as it  exists and as it will 
evolve in the future.

RFI Resolution Techniques
Up until this point, we have worked to identify the various types of RFI that affect 
radiocommunication systems and services. An understanding of the causes of this 
issue is essential for proceeding with the key step of preventing and/or removing 
RFI once it has occurred and had its impact. For this, we need to consider two 
regimens:
1.	 RFI resolution: the process of quantifying the type and source of the RFI 
and its effect on the planned or operating radiocommunication system.
2.	 RFI mitigation: the important step of identifying ways to remove or correct 
for the presence of the RFI when and if it occurs. This includes remediation 
of the unacceptable state of operation.
This is not unlike how a medical doctor first diagnoses a disease and deter­
mines the best treatment for its cure or reduction in the symptoms. This chapter is 
dedicated to the first process and provides some proven steps and guidelines, but 
the actual methodology for a given case will need to be worked out based on the 
specifics. The remaining chapters address the step of RFI mitigation.
7.1  Spectrum Analysis and Monitoring
Spectrum analysis is a basic and vital aspect of RFI investigation and its resolu­
tion and so is worth some explanation. The measurement tool that performs this 
function so admirably is called, simply, the spectrum analyzer. It is to spectrum 
analysis what the oscilloscope is to time waveform analysis. According to Keysight 
Technologies, the company originally known as HP and a strong proponent of this 
device [1]:
At the most basic level, a spectrum analyzer can be described as a frequency-selec­
tive, peak-responding voltmeter calibrated to display the rms value of a sine wave. 
It is important to understand that the spectrum analyzer is not a power meter, 
even though it can be used to display power directly. As long as we know some 
value of a sine wave (e.g., peak or average) and know the resistance across which 
we measure this value, we can calibrate our voltmeter to indicate power. With the 
advent of digital technology, modern spectrum analyzers have been given many 
more capabilities.

RFI Resolution Techniques
The original instrument was built on the foundation of the superheterodyne 
receiver to allow it to select and recover a signal over a much wider bandwidth and 
ultimately display it on an oscilloscope. These became commonplace in test and 
operating facilities across the widest range of radiocommunication systems. The 
basic arrangement of the superheterdyne spectrum analyzer, more commonly called 
a swept spectrum analyzer, is presented in Figure 7.1. All of the components and 
circuits were implemented in the early units with physical elements, such as induc­
tances, capacitances, transistor amplifiers, diode detectors, oscillators, and the like. 
As such, calibration was always an issue, both in the originally manufactured unit 
and as the unit was subject to operation and active use. Still, the basic function is 
completely valid, wherein the input is taken from a source of signals and RFI and 
applied to attenuators and filters before a mixing stage. A variable local oscilla­
tor is driven by a sweep generator to cause the IF signal to represent different RF 
frequencies across the bandwidth of the input. This is unlike a standard receiver 
where only one narrow frequency range is applied to the IF at a time.
The fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectrum analyzer, shown in Figure 7.2, uses 
digital signal-processing (DSP) techniques to provide in-depth analysis of signal 
spectra. DSP overcomes several deficiencies with swept frequency analyzers, en­
abling a multiplicity of fast capture and detailed analysis not possible with ana­
log sweep/superheterodyne techniques alone. With the availability of high-perfor­
mance analog-to-digital converters, the latest spectrum analyzers digitize incoming 
signals much earlier in the signal path compared to hybrid analog/digital spectrum 
analyzer designs of just a few years ago. Digital IFs have had a great impact on 
spectrum analyzer performance, with significant improvements in speed, accuracy,

and the ability to measure complex signals using advanced DSP techniques. Addi­
tional benefits of using the FFT approach include
••
Fast capture of waveform: In view of the fact that the waveform is analyzed 
digitally, the waveform can be captured in a relatively short time.
••
Ability to capture nonrepetitive events: The short capture time means that 
the FFT analyzer can capture nonrepetitive waveforms, giving them a capa­
bility not possible with analog spectrum analyzers.
••
Ability to analyze signal phase: As part of the signal-capture process, data is 
gained that can be processed to reveal the phase of signals (i.e., “i” and “q” 
components). 
••
Storage of waveforms: Using FFT technology, it is possible to capture the 
waveform and analyze it later should this be required. This allows compari­
son over time and trending.
There are two domains where the spectrum analyzer has great benefit: (1) the 
identification of unknown signals that are present within a bandwidth that con­
tains noise and existing signals (RFI investigation), and (2) detailed measurement 
of signal characteristics to verify prediction based on mathematical analysis or lab­
oratory measurement. The former can be qualitative, while the latter is both quali­
tative and quantitative. Whenever quantitative measurements are needed, there is 
the basic question of accuracy and precision of measurement. With improvements 
in direct ADC at RF, spectrum analysis is has moved quickly in the FFT direction.
The applications of spectrum analysis are varied, testifying to the versatility of 
this type of instrument. It provides a clear window into what is going on in a par­
ticular piece of radio spectrum, ranging from kilohertz up into the gigahertz region. 
Basic measurement capabilities include carrier power, noise spectral density, band­
width, and spectral shape. Furthermore, a spectrum analyzer is capable of contrib­
uting to our understanding of underlying characteristics of a given communica­
tions signal. In this regard, the other common spectrum analyzer measurements 
include modulation, intermodulation, and noise [3]. Measuring the quality of the 
modulation is important for making sure a system is working properly and that 
the information is being transmitted correctly. Understanding the spectral content 
is important, especially in communications with limited bandwidth. The amount 
of power being transmitted (e.g., to overcome the channel impairments in wire­
less systems) is another key measurement in communications. Tests such as modu­
lation degree, sideband amplitude, modulation quality, and occupied bandwidth 
are examples of common modulation measurements. In communications, measur­
ing distortion is critical for both the receiver and transmitter. Common distortion 
measurements include intermodulation, harmonics, and spurious emissions; any of 
these can produce RFI internally and externally as well. Tests such as noise figure 
and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are important for characterizing the performance 
of a device and/or its contribution to overall system noise. For all of these spectrum 
analyzer measurements, it is important to understand the operation of the spec­
trum analyzer (discussed below) and the spectrum analyzer performance required 
for a specific measurement to help choose the right analyzer for the application as 
well as get the most out of it.

The spectrogram is the basic display feature of the spectrum analyzer, presenting 
power (in dBm) versus frequency. The former is adjusted to a reference level based 
on an input attenuator; this allows relatively precise and accurate measurements 
of absolute power. The strength of the analyzer, however, is the ability to measure 
relative levels, say, down 3 dB or up 20 dB from a reference signal. The frequency 
display is selected by the user based on the range needed for the particular measure­
ment and the top frequency of the analyzer itself. The latter are typically 2 GHz or 
30 GHz, based on the chosen instrument. Control of the display is exercised using 
a combination of numerical keys, function keys (and associated menus), and at least 
one knob to manually adjust the center frequency, as shown in Figure 7.3(a). Some 
spectrum analyzers are “black boxes” that interface with a PC to display spectra 
and control all settings in the instrument.
Figure 7.3(a) presents the traditional embodiment of the spectrum analyzer; 
more recently, they are packaged in essentially handheld units to ease portability 
and use in the field (see Figure 7.9). Others are in the simple form of a black box 
or dongle to attach to a laptop computer, placing all controls within the normal

keyboard and mouse of PC  as in Figure 7.3(b). Since FFT calculations around 
spectrum analysis is compute-intensive, software-based test and measurement com­
panies like National Instruments have gained standing in the field. Rack-mounted 
and display-less spectrum analyzers operate as servers in a communication facility 
or laboratory environment. Most important to proper use of any format are the 
basic spectrum analyzer specifications:
••
Frequency range: This is the operating range of the analyzer, ending at some 
maximum frequency in the GHz range. Keep in mind that the frequency of 
observation may need to be a multiple of the expected carrier so that inter­
modulation products and harmonics can be observed as well.
••
Accuracy, frequency and amplitude: These are dictated by the respective sen­
sors within the analyzer, typically ±1 dB.
••
Resolution: Frequency resolution is the ability of a spectrum analyzer to 
separate two input sinusoids into distinct displays. While simple in concept, 
realization of this capability requires narrow filtering in the analyzer IF. On 
the other hand, a narrow filter has a slow response time, which means that 
the sweep rate must be low enough to permit resolution of the sine waves. 
Fast sweep is preferred unless the display has memory or persistence.
••
Sensitivity: Range of input signal, minimum to maximum, typically in dBm. 
Consider also the internal noise floor. The low end of the range is needed 
when measuring into deep signal fades or nulls.
••
Distortion: Produced when signals exceed the linear range of spectrum ana­
lyzer input. The RF input attenuator is a step attenuator located between 
the input connector and the first mixer. This is used to adjust the level of the 
signal incident upon the first mixer to prevent mixer gain compression and 
distortion due to high-level and/or broadband signals. The resulting range 
may need to be as much as 100 dB.
••
Dynamic range: Dynamic range is defined as the maximum ratio of two signal 
levels simultaneously present at the input that can be measured to a speci­
fied accuracy. This interacts with distortion and sensitivity. This is important 
when observing weak signals, such as RFI, present along with strong carriers. 
A dynamic range of 60 to 100 dB may be needed for particular measurements.
All of the above specifications can be determined by reviewing the manual of 
the particular analyzer (typically available for download from the vendor’s Web 
site). The more interesting aspect of the device is how it behaves in presenting the 
spectra of interest. We need to be able to see actual signals in the noise and deter­
mine peak power level (relative to some reference), bandwidth, and total energy 
of a given signal. Also, spectral shape can be of interest when analyzing unknown 
signals or measuring power spectral density. To do this, we must trade sweep rate, 
sweep range, predetection bandwidth (also called the resolution bandwidth), and 
postdetection bandwidth (also called video filter bandwidth). Resolution band­
width and video bandwidth are discussed next.
The intermediate frequency (IF) bandwidth is set following the swept down­
converter and plays a critical role in the ability to display and measure signals. As 

146 
�������������������������
RFI Resolution Techniques
shown in Figure 7.4, the IF follows the swept oscillator, producing what is called 
the resolution bandwidth (RBW). Specifically, the IF filter defines the RBW of the 
analyzer and can be changed via the front panel of the analyzer (or menu setting of 
the FFT processor). A broad range of variable resolution bandwidth settings can 
be used to optimize sweep for various signal conditions, yielding a tradeoff among 
frequency selectivity (the ability to resolve signals), SNR, and measurement speed 
(sweep rate).
We can see in Figure 7.4 that as RBW is narrowed, selectivity is improved (i.e., 
we are able to resolve the two input signals). This can also often improve SNR. The 
sweep speed and trace update rate, however, will degrade with narrower RBWs. 
The optimal RBW setting depends heavily on the characteristics of the signals of 
interest and is best determined by experimentation using the various controls. For a 
signal with defined sidebands, an excessively wide value of RB will cause the power 
of these sidebands to be lumped in with the overall carrier and thereby become 
invisible in the broadened display. Narrowing the RB allows the sidebands and 
other spectral details to become clearly visible. The sweep speed will need to be de­
creased, however, to permit spectral energy to pass through the filter or, in the case 
of an FFT analyzer, to be computed quickly enough to display the spectral details.
The video filter is a low-pass filter that is located after the envelope detector 
and before display processing. This filter determines the bandwidth of the video 
amplifier and is used to average or smooth the trace seen on the screen. These ele­
ments are illustrated in Figure 7.5.
Analyzers with DSP have capabilities beyond what the RBW and video fil­
ters are capable of doing. For example, the data after capture can be processed to 
produce various types of averages. A moving average, for example, smooths the 
Figure 7.4  The IF section of the analyzer provides the RBW, which permits finer definition of spec­
tral properties. (Courtesy of Keysight Technologies, Inc.)

7.2  Spectrum Monitoring and Carrier Measurement

spectral shape by removing short-term fluctuations that are due to various analyzer 
artifacts and internal and external noise.
The spectrum analyzer displays signal plus noise so that the closer a signal is to 
the noise level, the more the noise makes the signal difficult to see. When signal and 
noise are equal in power in the same RB, the signal appears to be 3 dB above the 
spectrum analyzer noise floor. By changing the video bandwidth (VBW) setting, we 
can decrease the peak-to-peak variations of noise. This type of display smoothing 
can be used to help find signals that otherwise might be obscured in the noise. To 
do this, we need to first narrow down the scan range and sweep rate; this means 
that the particular signal must be isolated so that it can be analyzed in this manner. 
Another postdetection feature displays a history of past traces, called peak hold. It 
is provided by a frame store of past traces to capture intermittent or highly variable 
signals such as RFI. Modern DSP analyzers offer many other features such as the 
waterfall display, helpful when observing intermitted signals like radar RFI.
7.2  Spectrum Monitoring and Carrier Measurement
Spectrum monitoring is performed by network or spectrum management facilities, 
usually associated with a master control station or satellite operator. They can be 
as simple as a spectrum analyzer of the type discussed in Section 7.1 that is con­
nected to a conveniently located antenna. The important feature of the antenna is 
that it provide the proper frequency range and pattern of reception for the area be­
ing monitored. A more elaborate facility would use computing resources to control 
various spectrum analyzers that are connected to local or remote antennas with 
coverage of various areas or regions. Both approaches are used extensively, with

ducing the baseband for envelope detection and video filtering. The scan on the left shows signal 
in noise and without video filtering; the benefit of video filtering is clear from the scan on the right.

the latter depending on software and databases to collect, process and display the 
spectral data.
According to infoDev [4], the purpose of spectrum monitoring should be to 
achieve
••
Spectrum efficiency in determining planned and actual frequency usage and 
occupancy, assessing availability of spectrum for future uses; 
••
Compliance with national spectrum management regulations to shape and 
sustain radio environments and user behavior, maximizing the benefit of the 
spectrum resource to society; and
••
Resolution of interference problems for existing and potential users.
The general arrangement of a spectrum monitoring system is indicated in Fig­
ure 7.6. A spectrum monitoring system for use in land-based applications would 
include many of the following capabilities:
••
Monitors and captures all types of signals (as expected in the application):
•	 Continuous, transients, high level, low level, adjacent channel;
••
Uses commercially available hardware and computer operating system; 
••
Modular design to permit update/add of subsystem components 
independently;

base of previous measurements;

Spectrum monitoring, particularly important for communications satellites, 
has evolved over the past 50 years to the point where systems can be deployed at as 
many locations as are needed. This simplifies the job of the network operator who 
may need to monitor transmissions on multiple satellites around the geostationary 
arc or on non-GEO constellations. The first such systems were installed in network 
operations centers of satellite operators for use in completing uplink access tests 
when a new earth station is entering the network. Power frequency, bandwidth, 
and polarization isolation are measured and checked against a predefined set of op­
erating parameters. The spectrum analyzers are then used to monitor power levels 
to be sure any variation is within acceptable limits. Other major users of satellite 
bandwidth, like TV networks and data communications providers, installed simi­
lar systems so they could monitor their respective networks of Earth stations. The 
system is also useful for troubleshooting remote Earth stations to detect abnormal 
conditions and perform routine maintenance. Those needs have migrated to the 
domain of larger wireless operators with towers and base station facilities over a 
wide or continental area.
Figure 7.7 presents the specific arrangement of the spectrum monitor and re­
corder (SMR) system by Crystal Solutions, a provider to Earth station operators. 
Remote sites have one or more antennas with associated spectrum analyzers that 
have the capability of being accessed by computer. The system allows the use of 
analyzers from different manufacturers and provides a consistent UI for all. There 
is a central server that houses the spectrum and carrier monitoring configuration 
for the remote sites, providing historical data and records for analysis and RFI 
troubleshooting. Examples of spectrum displays from different sources, but avail­
able centrally, are given in Figure 7.7.

and control local or remote analyzers.  Users working with a common ana­
lyzer can simultaneously view different measurements on different segments 
of a spectrum or different switch ports.
••
Background monitoring: measures transponders/carriers behind the scenes. 
Monitoring continues even when operators may not actively view the spec­
trum thus continuing to detect any anomalous carrier condition  or RFI, and 
log relevant carrier measurements for later analysis.
••
Historical trending and spectral playback: users can graph and view histori­
cal measurements for a transponder/carrier.  Users can also play back the 
recorded spectrums to view the spectrum as it changes.  Playback includes 
leap-to-anomaly feature to improve RFI investigation.
••
Spectrum recording: records the spectral trace for transponders/carriers full 
time or “On Anomaly” (i.e., recording automatically launches when an 
alarm condition occurs on a monitored spectrum segment). 
7.3  Interference Location and Radio Direction Finding
Location of an unknown source of RFI is a multiple-step process that (1) begins 
with identification and characterization and (2) moves through an investigation to 
find the location and specific emitter. The first steps are conducted using spectrum 
analysis with individual spectrum analyzers connected to the affected antennas, or 
a spectrum monitoring system of the type described in Section 7.2. This will yield 
the character of the RFI and provide some clues into its source. If it falls within the

antennas and spectrum analyzers [5]. (Courtesy of Crystal Solutions, LLC.) 

7.3  Interference Location and Radio Direction Finding

range of known or expected signal types, then it might be possible to demodulate 
the carrier in question and identify it directly (see Section 7.4) or indirectly through 
deductive reasoning. A process for the latter was suggested in Section 1.4.
The location of RFI is the most challenging step in the RFI resolution process. 
Assuming we have a clear picture of the RFI in terms of its frequency, power, and 
bandwidth, we will need a means of radio direction finding (RDF), which is noth­
ing new in radiocommunication. Something as simple as a directional antenna and 
a portable spectrum analyzer, shown in Figure 7.9, will suffice in many situations. 
A measurable peak in signal level (dBm on the scale) indicates the direction of 
source. Using this type of broadband antenna with a gain of approximately 12 
dB, there is an angular uncertainty of several degrees. The absolute level of signal 
indicates range, possibly allowing a calculation based on the basic link properties 
(assuming line-of-sight propagation). Even if the interference signals are attenuated 
by objects on the path, the reading can provide a measure based on past experience. 
The resulting signal reading could be a strong even if a long distance away. On the 
other hand, it could also be a closer weak signal.
RDF can also employ the known technique of triangulation, which is used 
in map reading with a compass to locate your own position from two known 
landmarks. The technique is illustrated in Figure 7.10 based on the use of the 
RDF equipment of Figure 7.9. Using a topographical map produced by the U.S. 
Geological Survey, we are able to discern hills and, to the extent they exist on 
the map, roads, and buildings. Error in the angle measurements will lead to some 
uncertainty in final location, as indicated by the dotted triangles (the RFI source 
could be anywhere within the polygon where the triangles overlap). It is a simple 
matter to move closer and obtain a more accurate location, however. It is assumed 
Figure 7.8  SMR software uses one or more spectrum analyzers to monitor hundreds of RF sources. 
When integrated with Crystal’s NMS+ solution, SMR can react to detected anomalies and automati­
cally route affected signals to digital signal processors for further investigation or reconfigure the 
signal path to an alternative path (either on the same site or to an alternative site) to restore service 
integrity. (Courtesy of Crystal Solutions, LLC.)

that there is one tester who must relocate from measurement position 1 to 2, a time 
period during which the RFI must remain on. Having the simultaneous measure­
ments will, of course, eliminate this delay. Location of RFI based on RDF amounts 
to RF snooping in the general vicinity of the source. Sometimes, propagation af­
fords us the opportunity to extend the range to hundreds or even thousands of 
kilometers. Yet the accuracy could suffer as a result and ultimately a close in RDF 
will be needed. Use of aircraft or satellites as points of reception is also a possibility, 
as discussed later in this section.

Schwartz.)

triangles (angle uncertainty) and shaded polygon (position uncertainty) provide an initial indication 
of location.

7.3  Interference Location and Radio Direction Finding 
153
More recently, the technique generally known as interferometry has gained 
in popularity as it allows RDF to be performed from a single location rather than 
multiple locations. The basic concept is to receive two or more samples of the 
same electromagnetic wave such that there is a phase and/or frequency difference 
between them. A phase difference indicates a different path length, because phase 
angle is related to wavelength (one wavelength equaling 360 degrees of phase) and 
a frequency difference indicates a difference in Doppler (equivalently, speed). If 
we receive the same signal with two antennas that are separated by some multiple 
of a wavelength, then we can discern something about the position of the source. 
This is because there is only one direction where the two samples of the same wave 
combine in a constructive manner. This direction, however, may in fact represent a 
line of possible source locations and a second measurement, perhaps later in time 
or with another frequency, can reduce this uncertainty.
Satellites are both a source of RFI and provide a means for its location. The ca­
pability to locate Earth-based RFI sources was established using the Time Difference 
of Arrival (TDOA) system, an interferometric technique, in which the propagation 
time for the uplink signal to a particular satellite is compared with the propagation 
time to an adjacent satellite. It was first established in satellite communications in 
the mid-1980s in response to a case of intentional jamming on the Galaxy 1 satel­
lite by an individual who called himself Captain Midnight. While this individual 
was found by the FBI through conventional police work, it was decided at Hughes 
Communications, the satellite operator, that some type of RDF system needed to 
be created. Through a literature search, we identified and subsequently evaluated 
TDOA. The technique was then demonstrated and shown effective using two an­
tennas located at the Fillmore, CA, Earth station and subsequently turned into an 
operational system by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology [6]. Given 
that the positions of the two spacecraft relative to the receiving station are precisely 
known, the difference in time of arrival over the two different paths isolates the 
possible uplink transmitter location to a one-dimensional curve on Earth’s surface. 
Such a system requires a two-channel receiving system capable of accurately esti­
mating the differential delay between the two paths, as is illustrated in Figure 7.11. 
Because the level of the uplink signal through the adjacent satellite path is typically 
30 to 40 dB lower than that through the primary satellite due to radiation in a 
sidelobe, high-sensitivity equipment is required for the adjacent satellite downlink. 
The corresponding transponder aboard the adjacent satellite should be only lightly 
occupied so as not to interfere with the relatively weak signal from the source of 
interest. Measurements taken at least eight hours apart isolate the problem to an 
area of an ellipse that is approximately 50 km along its major axis. From here, local 
RDF can be used to pinpoint the location of the source.
Over the years since 1990, TDOA has been extended to faster computation, 
better calibration, and ease of use. Major satellite operators and some users have 
installed such location systems, and at least one company provides it as a service. It 
has been proven effective in locating RFI, principally resulting from operational ac­
cidents and equipment malfunctions. Capabilities have been improved further with 
a technique called frequency difference of arrival (FDOA), which takes advantage 
of the frequency difference between the path over the interfered-with satellite and 
the adjacent satellite. This difference results from Doppler shift and from the fact 
that the frequency translation oscillators in the respective satellites are producing 

154

slightly different frequencies since they are not tied to the same source. Also, better 
location accuracy is provided by having accurate satellite orbit data, called ephem­
eris, to perform the calculations. Several system suppliers compete; some offer RFI 
location services using extensive database of satellites and Earth stations.
SAT Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kratos Corporation, provides 
a system called Sat ID, which is their TDOA/FDOA system that can provide an 
uncertainty ellipse of only 1 km in diameter as opposed to 300 km under the con­
dition of poor ephemeris data. These systems are owned by satellite operators and 
governments, and SAT Corporation also operates its own system to provide RFI 
location as a service.
7.4  Transmitter ID
We rely on the spectrum analyzer and spectrum analysis to identify and categorize 
RFI signals as we receive them through the victim system. Also, ancillary antennas 
can be used for this purpose as long as they are able to detect enough of the of­
fending signal. In terrestrial systems such as cellular and microwave line-of-sight 
radiocommunication, the distances involved are relatively short. A path including a 
satellite can extend the range many thousands of kilometers, however. As a result, 
the potential population for RFI sources can be extremely large and far removed. 
For this reason, there have been various efforts to create standards for inclusion of 
an identifying signal in the transmitter (transmitter ID), allowing a receiver the po­
tential to determine the source and follow up as appropriate. With a closed system 
using proprietary equipment, it is usually a simple matter to provide identification 
in the basic transmission or protocol structure. Open systems in a multivendor 
environment, however, can pose a challenge unless there are rigorous controls or 
standards that can be applied. This is the case in push-to-talk services used by pub­
lic service and the military, because all transmissions must be identified by the user.
A technique for introducing the ID data onto a standard TV transmission was 
first introduced into the satellite broadcasting industry around 1988, again as a

nas [6].

result of the Captain Midnight incident. As proposed by Home Box Office (HBO), 
a baseband subcarrier with Morse code was added to the normal video and audio 
modulation. This carried the industry well until broadcast went digital with digital 
satellite TV and digital cable TV. There are currently two forms of carrier ID in 
use in the commercial satellite industry: those that are embedded in MPEG Stream, 
or in the Network Information Table (NIT) field, and a subcarrier underneath the 
main carrier (spread spectrum). The NIT conveys information relating to the physi­
cal organization of the multiplexes carried via a given network, and the character­
istics of the network itself [7]. This approach works well on broadcast (DVB) video 
and data carriers that contain the MPEG stream, whereas the subcarrier technique 
can be applied more generally, but not on burst-mode TDMA signals from remote 
earth stations (VSATs). The latter is still unresolved yet viewed as a significant 
source of RFI into adjacent satellites.
Carrier ID was implemented for the 2014 Olympics using the NIT. ISI has 
a system for reading the NIT and operators will have their capability. Comtech 
EF Data introduced an alternative and more generally applicable system using a 
spread-spectrum subcarrier hidden under the main carrier, indicated in Figure 7.13.
Here is another caveat about applying transmitter ID to satellite signals. RFI 
on the satellite path can be introduced from a separate terrestrial source by leakage

fied. (Courtesy Comtech EF Data.)

into or from IF cables at an uplink Earth station. In the past, it was mostly from 
local FM stations around 88 MHz getting inside the 70-MHz IF found in older 
equipment. Now, with Earth stations using L-band IF systems (950 to 2,150 MHz), 
signals from cell towers can leak into the uplink side of VSATs. GSM 2G signals 
are being retransmitted around 950 MHz, which is at the bottom of the range. 
3G signals come higher in the United States. Also, 4G can potentially leak in at 
1,900 MHz. The Block Upconverter (BUC) that transmits at the VSAT can also be 
a source of leakage. Société Européene des Satéllites (SES) uses older Nokia GSM 
cell phones in the engineering mode, which allows a unit to identify the number of 
the cell tower that it is receiving. The cell tower in question is probably in another 
country leaking into the IF transmit (L-band) of a VSAT uplink. SES uses that 
phone in their teleport and in the field to read out the identification of the offend­
ing cell tower.
7.5  Additional Resources and Strategies
The many decades of experience with digital radiocommunication systems that 
employ land based towers and satellites provides an extensive repertoire of meth­
odologies and strategies for evaluating and mitigating RFI. In light of the fact that 
practically everyone on the planet is dependent on at least one form of radiocom­
munication (i.e., wireless), however, what we have is still not enough. Technology 
providers continue to build systems that minimize the threat of RFI and tend to 
mitigate its effect through improved MODCOD and adaptive features. So, we have 
a situation where the sheer volume of users and data transfer, and applications that 
use basic bandwidth and connectivity, grow rapidly. One trend is that regulatory 
bodies like the ITU and national agencies like the FCC, Industry Canada, ETSI, and 
others, work to increase the amount of spectrum available. This is a zero-sum game 
in that spectrum added for consumer wireless or government service must be taken 
from some other class of user. We discussed the process of sharing of spectrum, but 
this is not a panacea because sharing involves an acceptance of RFI between poten­
tially incompatible systems, which is easier said than done. A case in point can be 
found in the discussion in Section 6.4.2 of the failed attempt to introduce terrestrial 
wireless services using satellite L-band spectrum. The FCC belatedly recognized 
that fundamental GPS location services would be harmed by adjacent-channel RFI 
resulting from the introduction of the Ancillary Terrestrial Component (ATC).
7.5.1  Planning and Coordination
The current volume of radio traffic on legacy systems can probably handle the 
bulk of RFI incidents under the stable assumption of annual growth in the 5% 
to 10% range. There are lots of horror stories from the past, but the experience 
around 2015 has been good, even in the more contested areas such as 4G wireless, 
WiFi, and GEO satellite services throughout the world. This situation will not last 
because of changes in business and government strategy, notably the introduction 
of new technologies and competitors. We depend on those regulatory bodies and 
standards setting organizations to provide a level playing field and opportunity for 
new entrants that promise more and better in the way of wireless capabilities.

7.5  Additional Resources and Strategies 
157
But this must be balanced with the need to keep what is working in order. In the 
past, the dynamics made for interesting reading and even spectacle. For example, 
the prospective broadband satellite operator of the late 1990s, Teledesic, was able 
to corral literally all delegations at a key ITU World Radiocommunication Confer­
ence and thereby obtained their own sole-user block of spectrum at Ka-band. The 
spectrum in question was carved out of the existing FSS spectrum that had rela­
tively light usage. This trade would allow Teledesic to proceed without much risk 
of causing or receiving RFI. Alas, their efforts to build a system fell apart because 
of unacceptable cost of development, and the spectrum remained unused for more 
than a decade. Now, in 2015, a number of new entrants intend to follow Teledesic 
with their respective technical strategies, while the GEO community has discovered 
the benefits of Ka-band for their own broadband and broadcast services. Hav­
ing multiple LEO operators in the Teledesic spectrum will present an interesting 
challenge, and the planners will work out the details based on the past record and 
whatever technical data can be produced ahead of initial system operation. Strate­
gies for spectrum allocation in such instances are covered in Section 8.1.3.
Similarly, we saw that NTIA has studied the possibility of sharing C-band spec­
trum between 4G LTE operators and the currently existing maritime radar com­
munity. The study presented in Section 6.4.1 gave only a small part of the picture 
of what could happen when these systems collide in space and time. Sharing among 
very different systems is not so easily done, and the rules of the road can impose 
harsh limitations. An incumbent like the U.S. Navy might not appreciate having a 
new source of RFI appear on their screens, so to speak. And the wireless operators 
might not find the value they are looking for in spectrum that, to them, is polluted 
with powerful and intermittent radar signals. The discussion of cognitive radio in 
Section 9.2, however, along with good spectrum monitoring and carrier ID, offers 
a path forward for intelligent spectrum sharing.
7.5.2  Research and Testing
Planners cannot do their job without meaningful data concerning new or modified 
radiocommunication systems, especially with regard to RFI threats. Keep in mind 
that the threat can go both ways, so it is a case where cooperative investigation is 
the best approach. But this is not often the case because the players in this game 
can be competitors or even adversaries. A case in point was a threshold situation 
that existed around 1975 when a new regional operator needed to put satellites into 
service in a region that seemed lightly occupied with GEO satellites tens of degrees 
apart. They did not expect the kind of resistance they got from some powerful 
incumbents who resisted this new entrant on more than RFI grounds, however. It 
took an extended effort on technical, business, and political levels to achieve the 
satisfactory result that was obtained.
Part of the issue involved a new digital application that was to use the tech­
nique of Single Channel per Carrier (SCPC), where each voice circuit would employ 
a carrier with QPSK modulation under the management of a demand assignment 
system. It was not understood at the time how this link would behave in the pres­
ence of analog frequency-modulated TV transmissions in transponders on adjacent 
satellites. The basic geometry and signal spectrum for this situation is presented 
in Figure 7.14. The digital link operates at a nominal information data rate of 64

kbps corresponding to the DS0 channel, while the FT/TV transmission contains an 
energy dispersal (ED) frequency sweep of 2-MHz bandwidth to reduce the radiated 
power spectral density (PSD). The rate of sweep is only 15 kHz corresponding to 
the line sweep rate of analog TV. As a result, the FM/TV signal appears as a quasi-
static unmodulated carrier when it is within the bandwidth of the SCPC receiver/
demodulator. With adjacent satellite isolation of approximately 30 dB and a dif­
ference in carrier power in the range of 10 to 20 dB (the TV carrier is at maximum 
power and the SCPC carrier is backed off), the carrier C/I is in the range of 20 dB 
to 10 dB. But this is only present when the FM carrier passes through the victim 
SCPC receiver bandwidth. 
Let us assume that this increases the BER from 10–8 to approximately 10–5.
The interfering carrier sweeps back and forth across the bandwidth shown with 
a constant power. Thus, RFI exists during the fraction of time (e.g., duty cycle):

where Rs is the symbol rate. For example, if we assume QPSK then Rs = 32 kHz and 
the ratio above is 32/2,000 or 0.016. Simply stated, the BER is unaffected during 
98.4% of the period and experiences RFI at the assumed protection ratio, C/I, only 
during 1.6% of the time. Taking the worst case C/I of 10 dB and the corresponding 
BER of 10–5, we can estimate the average BER by the following relationship:

The first term in the equation counts bit errors when the interfering carrier is 
out of band and the second term counts bit errors during the actual interference 
when the sweeping carrier is within the bandwidth of the SCPC signal. We see 
that the average BER is more in line with the out-of-band condition. Remediation 
would consist of increasing carrier power and hence C/N in the absence of RFI by 
some amount, perhaps 1 dB.
The analysis and its result, above, were taken by the other party as supposition 
of a theory that needs verification. Verification was performed at the time using an 
off-the-shelf digital SCPC modem and FM/TV modulator, confirming the analysis. 
An expanded test program, subsequently conducted and reported by Eutelsat 
[8], involved an updated set of link parameters, reflecting the improvements in 
satellite operation over the intervening period of ten years. Specifically, the early 
studies summarized above had been operated under relatively high carrier-to-ther­
mal noise ratio (15 to 16 dB) in the SCPC channel bandwidth (i.e., 32-kHz noise 
equivalent bandwidth) to achieve a BER of less than 10-6 in the absence of inter­
ference. Data rates available in the then-existing Eutelsat Satellite Multiservices 
System (SMS) in the range 64 kbps to 1,920 kbps needed to be evaluated under 
this RFI environment. Furthermore, the system uses rate ½ convolutional FEC en­
coding with eight-level soft-decision Viterbi decoding as a means of improving the 
tradeoff between space segment bandwidth and power. As a result of this encoding, 
the SCPC carriers in the SMS operated with much lower carrier-to-thermal noise 
ratio (by approximately 6 dB) than those considered in the previous studies. The 
changed conditions could invalidate the conclusions from ten years prior.
The interference from a co-channel FM television signal harming an encoded 
SCPC channel raises several questions: 
How will the decoder react to a potential burst of errors created by a high-
energy component falling within in the channel bandwidth?
What C/I values can an SCPC channel tolerate when encoded?
What is the dependence on C/I for SCPC channels having different bandwidths?
The laboratory tests were performed with the configuration shown in Figure 
7.15 employing commercially available equipment to evaluate the interference 
caused by the same FM/TV carrier to the encoded SCPC/QPSK channel.

RFI Resolution Techniques
We present some of the more important results of this investigation in Table 
7.1. These tests evaluated the degradation suffered by the SCPC channel when sub­
jected to an unmodulated TV interferer in three different forms: CW plain carrier 
within the SCPC carrier bandwidth, the ED waveform only (sweeping carrier), and 
ED with video synchronization pulses (black picture). The ED deviation was varied 
in the range 1 to 4 MHz peak to peak to evaluate the effect of duty cycle for the RFI 
being within the bandwidth of the SCPC carrier. Initial tests without RFI produced 
values of C/N at measured BER of 1×10–6 that were 5.4 dB and 5.1 dB for data 
rates of 64 kbps and 1,920 kbps, respectively. The degradation caused by the RFI 
represents an increase in C/N required to return the error rate to the required value. 
A degradation of 0.5 dB will cause the error rate to climb approximately one order 
of magnitude (e.g., from 10–6 to 10–5), which is correctable by increasing the link 
C/N (without RFI) by 0.5 dB.
The table illustrates several principles in RFI investigation, such as the effect of 
a pure carrier versus a swept carrier that extends substantially beyond the band­
width of the victim carrier. The digital mode of transmission with QPSK has a 
degree of inherent protection (higher orders of modulation that combine phase and 
amplitude keying may not be as resilient). A pure sinewave causing the RFI should 
have a value of C/I of about 14 dB, which means that the interference should be 
approximately 10 dB below the carrier. The case of the spread carrier allows the 
C/I to approach the link C/N, or RFI power equal to carrier power, however. This is 
because the RFI remains outside the bandwidth of the carrier for a substantial frac­
tion of the time, the conclusion reached in the original analysis discussed above. 
As one would expect, if ED bandwidth is approximately equal to digital carrier 
bandwidth (1 or 2 MHz for the 2-Mbps carrier), the RFI has nearly the same effect 
as the CW interference. The investigation also showed that there were no unusual 
burst-error effects due to the duty cycle of the swept carrier.
This real-world case study demonstrates the importance of the methodology of 
evaluation and testing to yield a robust conclusion about RFI under the specified 
conditions. The operator was able to use the data to establish C/I criteria that ad­
dress the various conditions of the RFI and the link. One cannot generalize based 
on the answer, but the process is shown to be valuable when the parameters are 
known.

7.5.3  Remediation
Remediation is defined as simply the correction of something that is bad or defec­
tive. We have to live with some level of RFI, especially because it is usually due to 
the normal operation of internal and external transmitting sources of RF energy. 
But remediation has to do with our response to RFI that causes unacceptable deg­
radation to our service. As we have discussed previously, the first task after the RFI 
is identified is to establish if it is internal to our own system or network, the case 
perhaps 50% or more of the time. We can then work to improve our internal opera­
tion and either avoid or remove the cause (or make the link less susceptible). If it is 
an external RFI source, then we need some kind of cooperative approach; barring 
that, we need to find ways to operate in the presence of this external RFI. 
All of these approaches can work. The choice will depend on the time, cost, 
and resulting performance. The next sections address the nature of our corrective 
action: is it a short-term “stopgap” solution, or is it a long-term type of perma­
nent resolution of the problem (until something changes that introduces a new RFI 
source and effect).
7.5.3.1  Short Term
A short-term stopgap RFI remediation strategy may be something cobbled together 
quickly to arrive at a solution to the immediate problem. Alternatively, it could 
work more profoundly to address the situation in a more lasting and sustainable 
manner. The RFI could be a one-off incident without reoccurrence or much reper­
cussion, or it could indicate something more serious like a change in the overall 
operating environment. As a result, we have to treat a new RFI incident as a serious 
matter and conduct a thorough investigation using the methodologies discussed 
previously. Our remediation efforts could involve changes to the receiver to sup­
press RFI, or to the transmitter to limit its presence in the first place. While both 
sides of this equation are involved, changes to the transmitter (and its antenna) are 
potentially complex and more difficult than changes to the receiver. However, a 
large inventory of existing receivers (as in the ATC vs GPS case) pose a major chal­
lenge when encountered late in the process.
Let us say that we have characterized and localized the source and are now 
ready to determine a remediation approach. If the RFI source is under our control 
and can be removed with ease, then it is an ideal situation. On the other hand, a 
source outside our system or jurisdiction will involve actions on several levels. This 
means that more authority needs to be activated, including managers, other opera­
tors (including competitors), and possibly governments.
A situation arose like this for the author back at the time when the U.S. FCC 
ordered that GEO satellite spacing for the United States be reduced from 4 deg to 
2 deg. The U.S. community of satellite operators were generally in agreement and 
had contributed to the overall study of the issue. But the actual environment had 
never been experienced in practice. The real-world came into view once our satel­
lite was located within 2 deg of its neighbor.
Most C-band video uplink Earth stations at the time used antennas of the 9m 
or greater class, permitting acceptable operation even at the reduced orbit spacing. 
The uplink C/I would be at least 30 dB, assuming identical satellites 2 degrees apart 

162 
�������������������������
RFI Resolution Techniques
with the standard formula for sidelobes and a 9m antenna. There were temporary 
operators, however, who used transportable antennas of the 6m class (reducing 
the C/I by 4 dB or more) to provide uplinks at venues like stadiums and news 
scenes. One night, we received a complaint from another operator about RFI to 
one of their broadcast channels, and it was determined that it was in fact a tempo­
rary transmission on our satellite from one of these transportable stations. As the 
technical manager, I placed a call to my counterpart at the other satellite operator, 
which was our primary competitor, to discuss the situation going forward. In a 
friendly way, he informed me that the FCC had classified these smaller antennas 
as nonstandard and that if they were to cause interference with others using stan­
dard antennas then they must shut down. After thanking him, I contacted our 
legal counsel in Washington, D.C., who followed up and confirmed the FCC order. 
From that point, we issued instructions to our network operation center that these 
smaller antennas were only allowed to transmit on frequencies that would not 
cause adjacent satellite interference. The total time from incident to final resolution 
was less than a week.
Here we see that an incident of RFI was really the precursor for how our sys­
tem must be operated in the new environment. Other situations arise where the RFI 
is indeed a single case requiring only a limited corrective action. A case in point was 
out-of-band radar interference that overloaded the front end of an Earth station 
operating in an adjacent band, discussed in Section 5.3.1. The simple and effec­
tive solution was to insert a bandpass filter ahead of the low-noise amplifier in the 
Earth station antenna. The same kind of solution removed RFI in a C-band receiver 
due to RFI from radar on train engines and to automobile radar detectors. Filters of 
that type are readily available and one wonders why they are not standard design 
practice. But, we often have to relearn well-proven solutions. 
An example of unexpected RFI to a GSM cellular operation was reported by 
COMSEACH, a unit of CommScope Company [9]. A U.S. cellular operator was 
experiencing a high degree of dropped calls in one sector of a base station. When 
COMSEARCH investigated, however, the problem did not immediately present 
itself. Eventually, it was found to be due to private and improper use of vehicular 
cellphone amplifiers in the 800-MHz band capable of causing in-band RFI to the 
GSM network. This device couples to a cellphone using a small antenna that is 
connected to the amplifier and an external vehicular antenna to reach the base sta­
tion. If the cellphone is too close to this antenna, the amplifier overloads and emits 
spurious signals that are as much as 30 dB higher that what is required. It was no 
wonder that when a vehicle functions in this manner that the operation of the cell 
site is disrupted. Any solution to this kind of issue will require controls placed on 
customers who might employ such nonstandard and RFI-prone equipment. One 
idea might be to detect if a subscriber is using one of these amplifiers and then to 
move them to an open segment of the band. More strategies are suggested in Sec­
tion 8.1.1, which particularly involve changes in frequency assignment.
7.5.3.2  Long Term
The long-term picture for remediation follows along the lines of good engineer­
ing and operating design and practice. Our radiocommunication systems must be 
designed and employed under the assumption of existing RFI and the potential 

7.5  Additional Resources and Strategies 
163
appearance of RFI in the future. New systems like 4G wireless and advanced broad­
band satellite networks include many dynamic features with inherent ability to miti­
gate RFI as it appears. With regard to satellites, the ITU regulatory process has been 
particularly effective in promoting innovation [10]. But, even these will need human 
intervention and design work as performance degrades beyond what was initially 
recognized. The long term involves a thorough understanding of all of the principles 
discussed previously in the volume, as well as the details of the characteristics of the 
potentially victim system. The examples covered in this and the previous chapter 
suggest the range of what can be involved. The extent of investigation and testing 
can grow well beyond what one initially thinks is adequate. Most RFI involves 
other parties and players so it is partly engineering and partly conflict resolution. 
The latter is best addressed in friendly collaboration or negotiation. If it becomes 
an unfriendly type of conflict, there may be no currently available resolution with­
out one party vacating the spectrum or drastically changing how they operate. The 
good news is that RFI is a two-sided issue: the party causing RFI is probably trying 
to conduct its own radiocommunication and wishes to enjoy its rights to spectrum 
with minimal impairment. Methodologies covered in the remaining chapter offer 
state-of-the-art schemes for adaptive systems that address these challenges.

How to Identify, Prevent, and Fix 
Common RFI problems
This chapter is about the tactics of addressing RFI before it rears its ugly head or 
after it causes trouble and/or harm to an operating radiocommunication system. 
As a critical type of troubleshooting in telecommunications, RFI is a menace that 
appears when least expected and often with dire results. There is a host of activity 
we can do in response to an RFI incident, whether short term (nice, because it even­
tually disappears), long term (troublesome, but addressable through a change in 
technical design or operation), or intermittent (often nasty and usually the hardest 
to deal with due to the “cat and mouse” nature of getting to the problem). First we 
consider the mind-set of the RFI planner/avoider as well as the troubleshooter who 
must take the most appropriate corrective steps. In anticipation of RFI in a system, 
we address planning steps and interference-reduction strategies for the long term. 
The impact will be lessened if RFI has a localized impact and the frequency change 
does not affect the overall system.
8.1  Frequency Planning Techniques
Frequency planning consists of making assignments that avoid RFI in the first 
place and allow it to be mitigated when it does occur. We first consider making a 
frequency change as a simple but effective means of sidestepping RFI. A pool of 
available frequencies is perhaps the best means of being ready for an RFI incident. 
Employing this reserve to dodge RFI, however, means that there must be a means of 
issuing and installing the new frequencies in a rapid and reliable manner. 
8.1.1  Frequency Assignment
The following provides a few examples, which while from the past, illustrated the 
principles of using extra frequency channels when needed. The radiocommunica­
tion system for military tactical radiocommunication operated in the VHF band 
(direct and with repeaters) and consisted of approximately 100 independent “nets,” 
using push-to-talk radios where one user talks while the others on frequency lis­
ten. There is always a central network control station, but any user can request to

transmit. This principle is often applied to automated systems such as trunk radio 
and some satellite networks.
••
Inter-net (net-to-net) interference could be produced when a user happens 
to be located on high ground or in an aircraft, extending the range beyond 
what was planned. Some of this type of RFI is expected since channels need 
to be reused across a broad geographical area with normal terrain provid­
ing needed isolation. All user nets would have backup channels to switch 
to in such an event, a step that did not require central coordination since 
the channel was preassigned for their use. RFI would be less likely during a 
temporary change.
••
Interference from any external source that persists would require a perma­
nent change to a different channel, which was maintained by the assign­
ment authority (the author) and doled out when needed. A rogue source 
we experienced was from broadcasters who commandeered frequencies to 
transmit music or other content. This would necessitate informing all users 
in the particular net, as well as those in a higher or related command who 
had need to enter the particular net at any time. The rejected channel would 
be returned to the pool (my card file) and perhaps applied in another area, 
subject to any repeat incident. Channels prone to repeated RFI issues (about 
5% of the total) would be kept out of service indefinitely, allowing time for 
further investigation or other disposition such as “trading” with a neighbor­
ing command.
••
Channels were periodically shuffled and reassigned to maintain security, be­
cause assignments to specific organizations were classified. Also, each net 
used its own verbal callsign, such as “Dark Flight,” and these names changed 
for security reasons as well. A civilian or consumer application probably 
does not require such shifting of assignments, but like passwords, periodic 
change does enhance security as radio signals are easily intercepted.
This short case study represents the real world, and we can find additional 
examples in a more modern era. Spectrum that is supposed to be clear can end up 
having RFI within it, either initially or in the future. Excess channel capacity is 
a means to assure ourselves that the service can continue as we conduct our RFI 
investigation and remediation activities. The difficult part is having the means to 
distribute the new frequencies to the radio terminals that need them and then verify 
that all is working correctly. An example in satellite communications involved an 
SCPC satellite network using a central hub station and remote VSATs operated by 
independent subscribers who required Internet access. A portion of the satellite 
transponder experienced RFI that was being investigated by the satellite operator; 
however, service had to be maintained until the RFI could be removed. In the mean­
time, we used the network management system to direct the affected terminals to 
a different segment of the band. This is a simple solution that provided “breathing 
room” until the satellite operator had located and removed the source of RFI.
The NTIA test of 4G LTE operation in the presence of radar, described in 
Section 6.4.1, highlighted how modern networks automatically correct for the 
presence of high traffic loading and RFI. Through the process of assigning RBs, 

8.1  Frequency Planning Techniques 
167
the base station commands the remote user equipment to employ a particular fre­
quency or block of frequencies. These are taken from a pool of resource and that 
pool can be adjusted to reflect an understanding of the local RFI environment. Ad 
hoc networks such as Wi-Fi perform this function automatically as well, being able 
to change modulation and bandwidth dynamically in response to increases in the 
combination of noise and interference. Furthermore, Fluke Networks, provider of 
electronic measurement systems, offers a Wi-Fi monitor that can identify and locate 
RFI affecting Wi-Fi network performance. We can watch for the presence of RFI 
through monitoring the behavior of such systems.
8.1.2  Transmitter Control and ID
The treatment in this text of RFI is based on the premise that the cause is a trans­
mitter that is reaching the victim receiver as a result of one of the following mecha­
nisms: abnormal propagation; an equipment malfunction or configuration error; or 
possibly due to improper and intentional operation. Consequently, standard prac­
tice in radiocommunication is to have a means of disabling every transmitter. This 
is mandated by whatever regulatory body licenses the operation of transmitters in 
the particular locale. Legal but unlicensed transmitters may be another story, be­
cause they are not supposed to cause harmful interference to licensed systems. But, 
Murphy’s Law is always at play and there is the potential for rogue transmitters 
that start transmitting on their own. Most incidents involve this type of failure, as 
evidenced through spectrum monitoring and RDF activities in the satellite com­
munications field. Also, rogue transmitters may be activated on purpose either to 
“pirate” bandwidth or intentionally cause harm to others. Developed countries 
have good systems of licensing and possibly enforcement; however, the situation in 
other parts of the world can produce high levels of unexpected RFI from sources 
not considered typical in North America, Europe, and Japan. The time spent in­
vestigating RFI gives a better understanding of the local environment and ways of 
identifying a potential source. Taking legal action may be another matter as regula­
tors have varying levels of involvement. In recent years, the U.S. FCC has moved 
away from RFI enforcement and closed many of their field offices. So, it becomes 
a matter of watching out for your own spectrum while others do the same with 
respect to theirs.
In RFI control, our first priority is to be able to remove the source of interfer­
ence once it is identified, and transmitter control is the obvious way to do this. 
Transmitter control can be exercised locally by an operator or technician, or re­
motely either over the radio link or by some other connection such as through the 
voice network or the Internet. Having two such facilities available is the ideal case 
and probably necessary for any system using high-powered RF transmitters and 
antennas capable of propagating over a long distance. 
Network operators know the value of “getting the word out” when an abnor­
mal RFI situation arises. The objective is generally to remove the problem; getting 
to the bottom of it in terms of the source or perpetrator is important and useful 
as well. The priority can be on the latter provided that the spare channels, dis­
cussed in the previous section, are readily available. If not, the RFI is causing harm 
and the former (removal) is number one. A culprit may remove the RFI but does

not acknowledge their responsibility. A good system of event logging (e.g., trouble 
ticketing) and spectrum recording provides evidence for RFI forensic investigation.
Once identified, the removal would involve one of the following procedures:
••
Communicating with all potential sources via e-mail, telephone, or some 
form of broadcast messaging to improve the chance that the RFI will just 
disappear.
••
Using spectrum analysis and possibly RDF to narrow the options and pin­
point the source.
••
Performing maintenance, including realignment and rebooting of equipment, 
to correct an issue or uncover what might be an unexpected source. Accord­
ing to Sherlock Holmes in The Hound of the Baskervilles, “The very point 
which appears to complicate a case is, when duly considered and scientifi­
cally handled, the one which is most likely to elucidate it.”
••
Modifying the operation to reduce radiated power, or changing direction of 
transmission or reception.
Additional steps and techniques are covered in the following paragraphs. The 
body of knowledge and experience is great, but there is perhaps no limit to the 
steps that can be taken. As this must be tailored to the specific situation, the inci­
dent management approach covered in Section 8.3 should be considered in cases of 
RFI that seriously hamper or endanger an operating radiocommunication system.
A source of RFI that is a licensed transmitter will usually self-identify through 
the modulation that it contains. Standardized systems like 3G and 4G wireless base 
stations and user equipment, digital TV (MPEG and DVB) transmissions over the 
air and satellites, common-carrier microwave links, and many HF and VHF radio 
transmitters all incorporate identification along with other internal network con­
trol data. Network operators in these domains all have provision to receive and 
interpret such data, which is a good reason why they are the first line of defense 
when RFI appears. Barring transmitter ID, we are left with the various RDF tech­
niques discussed in Section 7.3.
RFI response is often difficult and time consuming. Again according to Hol­
mes, “Genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains.” You must “dig in” and work 
it hard to identify the potential causes, narrow down to the one that needs to be 
addressed, and finding a solution – specifically short term and/or long term – that 
allows the services to continue or be restored swiftly.
8.1.3  Interleaving Spectra and Band Segmentation
Gross incompatibility can result from differences in transmissions that are extensive 
and prevent a straightforward way of coexistence in the same band. One user that 
occasionally transmits at high power in either random or particular directions can 
cause unacceptably high interference to another that maintains a fairly low level of 
power spectral density. Getting around this often involves an agreement to split up 
the spectrum into segments where like users can operate and reasonably coexist. 
This and other strategies for assigning uses to a block of spectrum are illustrated in 
Figure 8.1 and detailed below.

8.1  Frequency Planning Techniques 
169
8.1.3.1  Single Block of Spectrum Shared by All Classes of Users
The general approach of strategy A in Figure 8.1 provides that users, regardless of 
their technical and service strategies, coexist within the same block of spectrum. 
This was allowed in the past when technology limited what each user could actually 
transmit in terms of bandwidth and power (e.g., Morse code transmission in the HF 
bands or taxi radios). The basic concept of “listen before transmitting” can work 
as long as time delays are short (as in short-distance communication) and a user 
can wait if the particular channel is already occupied. With a central control point, 
like the net control in military radio nets, it is possible to prevent interference using 
strict protocol and procedures. As a general principle, though, the ITU has estab­
lished certain “services” to force a degree of commonality among groups of users. 
For example, the Fixed Service is restricted to point-to-point transmissions between 
fixed points on the ground, along with many technical specifications that tend to 
improve overall bandwidth use efficiency and preclude RFI caused to other services 
that share this band (e.g., FSS). When users operate within a set of constraints, we 
often describe the overall occupancy of spectrum as “homogeneous.” Allowing 
significant variation in power and bandwidth, that is, a “heterogeneous” environ­
ment, however, is more problematic as a higher power user may achieve their goals, 
but the lower power user can suffer from RFI due to the high power user.
Working within the single block of A is like traffic on major highway that 
has limited access but allows a wide range of vehicle size and weight (motorbikes, 
cars, pickup trucks, tractor trailers, recreation vehicles, etc.). Each vehicle enters 
by an on-ramp and mixes in with others of varying sizes. The same might be said 
of railroads, which have fewer lanes of traffic and with limited ability to pass one 
another. It is possible to accommodate more traffic by using a scheme of assign­
ing priorities, such as to a “presidential” train granted sole-user status on a given 
line, and by time scheduling all occupancy. Both require some kind of coordination 
entity that has master control capability. This can be done by a “traffic cop” to 
direct traffic and be ready to step in when activity results in conflict. Some have

suggested computerized highways where vehicles are controlled through a wireless 
link. These models can be applied to providing spectrum access.
National regulatory agencies and the ITU have a role here, but they lack re­
sources and, like the ITU, have no real power over operators. It is possible to 
implement self-regulation and policing, where user groups depend on each other’s 
behavior. One such suggestion was to treat a block of spectrum like a commons, 
defined as resources belonging to or affecting the whole of a community and held 
in common. The problem with a commons is that the right of access will be ex­
ploited by some in a manner that thwarts others from doing the same (e.g., selfish 
over-grazing).
8.1.3.2  Interleave Spectrum into Blocks for Like Users
Interleaving of bands in strategy B offers the opportunity to group similar signal 
types together, as illustrated in Figure 8.2. Thus, the forward links (also called 
downlinks) that broadcast information to all users can use the bottom segment 
while weaker transmissions from user terminals transmit in the return direction 
(uplinks) in the next higher band. These are homogeneous in their respective rights. 
This approach would seem to produce the best results by precluding the need for 
detailed coordination or conflict in the absence thereof. Next, sensitive or criti­
cal links for network control could be positioned above the return link band, and 
another segment provided at the high end for low-power mesh networks (possi­
bly for multi-access for mobile users indicated in Figure 8.2). The performance of 
these bands, individually and collectively, could be assessed by some combination of 
analysis, computer simulation, and testing. The areas at the geographic boundaries 
of cells pose the greater difficulty among users within the same segment. But this is 
the classical issue for frequency reuse patterns employed in cellular networks and 
for satellites with multiple-beam coverage.

interleaving (strategy B) to control RFI.

171
8.1.3.3  Segment into Individual User Blocks to Avoid RFI
Bands can be segmented to protect a more sensitive group of users from what would 
otherwise be incompatible. Strategy C in Figure 8.1 illustrates this approach; in it, 
there is an issue at the boundary as for base stations in Section 6.4.2 that would 
potentially interfere with the multitude of GPS receivers operating in an adjacent 
band. The U.S. FCC intended to allow ATC to employ MSS L-band spectrum that 
had already been in use for several decades. The potential for out-of-band interfer­
ence to GPS receivers in the adjacent band had not been adequately addressed even 
though it was known that ATC base stations would transmit at high power levels 
relative to what the MSS satellites are capable of doing. That particular problem 
was insoluble because the guardband involved would push ATC beyond the range 
of spectrum available to the operator. On the other hand, this type of band seg­
mentation is done all the time to allow different cellular and wireless operators 
to serve the same region or metropolitan area. One does not hear much about 
operator-to-operator conflict because they employ separate spectrum and use simi­
lar equipment.
There is usually a desire to make all of the spectrum available across the user 
base to maximize the bandwidth that a given user or application can obtain. But, 
the RFI can produce an unworkable situation in terms of its net effect on Eb/N0, 
negating the benefits of a wide RF bandwidth. Even though band segmentation is 
the logical means of addressing this, there may still be issues where the band edges 
meet. This situation can be addressed through power control and frequency as­
signment tactics (reduce power and/or change frequency if a given user causes or 
receives unacceptable RFI at the border). More will be said on this in Chapter 9.
8.1.4  Power Control
When noise and interference combine, the result is often a reduction in the predetec­
tion C/N or, equivalently, Eb/N0. Taken in isolation, this can be compensated by a 
simple increase in transmitted power. The amount of increase can be estimated from 
the link budget, which takes into account all interference and noise sources (Section 
6.1.1). However, the downside of this could be an increase in the level of RFI to a 
victim system operating within proximity or reachable via sporadic propagation. 
A general principle of spectrum management is that users should employ the least 
power necessary to provide a working link. The ITU Radio Regulations stipulate 
that “Stations should use the minimum power necessary to cover the area.” If all us­
ers were to do this, capacity is maximized. However, variations due to propagation 
and user antenna location and orientation tend to undermine this simple principle, 
unless power is tightly controlled. As discussed in Section 6.1.1.2, error or inaccu­
racy in power control results in a loss of capacity relative to the ideal situation. We 
will come back to this in Section 8.3 where interference cancellation is discussed.
8.2  Avoiding Intermodulation
Intermodulation in this context refers to signals that result from the nonlinear in­
teraction of multiple signals on different frequencies within RF equipment or a

modulation frequencies can be predicted based on the source frequencies according 
to

Where M and N are integers (1, 2, 3, …), ftx is a transmit frequency, and flo is 
another frequency from a local oscillator or other proximate source of RF. The new 
frequencies appear across a wide spectrum and their respective levels are highly 
nonlinear. Generally speaking, the designer or operator of a facility seeks to avoid 
those frequencies that fall in band or close to in band of receivers. This is illustrated 
in Figure 8.3 for an equipment chain that could represent a more complex facility 
with unintended nonlinear elements within transmission lines and antennas (i.e., 
passive intermodulation). The first oscillator is multiplied to produce a desired RF 
frequency, filtered and applied to another nonlinearity. Within the latter, the input 
frequencies interact and produce a broad spectrum of intermodulation products. 
Filtering can only reduce the quantity of spurious (spur) carriers; it cannot remove 
those that fall close to or within the bandwidth of the desired signal.
Equations of the above form are programmed into software tools and graphi­
cal charts that guide engineers so that intermodulation products remain outside 
of the band of interest. An example of such a chart is provided in Figure 8.4, 
produced using the Keysight Genesis analysis software tool that evaluates “what 
if” scenarios by calculating all frequency combinations. Operation in the solid bar 
channels must be avoided as they contain the strongest spurious frequencies. Other 
regions are deemed “spur free,” meaning that there is no risk of interference. This 
type of presentation has also been referred to as a “spotty dog chart” in recognition

of its graphical appearance. Technology providers often supply versions of this 
chart with the transmission equipment to guide users who wish to operate multiple 
transmitters and receivers in a common facility.
Because intermodulation frequencies are predictable, their existence and power 
level can be checked using straightforward spectrum analysis. If the RFI is in fact 
on an intermodulation frequency, it could be resolved through the identification 
of the nonlinear element where the generating frequencies interact. Any bimetallic 
structure acting as a diode will produce the intermodulation, so it is a case of ex­
amining the facility carefully for such points of trouble. One such example involved 
RFI to an airport radar that was determined to be local UHF broadcast station 
generated PIM from a chain-link fence.
8.3  Interference Cancellation
Simply stated, interference cancellation is accomplished by subtracting a sample 
of the RFI from the inbound signal that contains the desired carrier plus the RFI. 
The trick is to be sure that the amplitudes are equal and that the phase, polarity, 
or other appropriate property is opposite. The domains where this can be done are 
presented in Figure 8.5. Relatively recent advancements in interference cancellation 
are promising good solutions for reducing or even removing RFI within the receiv­
ing chain. Historically, cancellation requires a separate sample of the interfering 
signal which can be adjusted in power and phase, and properly subtracted from the

signals received from the primary antenna. This is basically the same principle of 
noise cancelling headphones. Cancellation can also be performed after the antenna 
with this interference sample in the IF, baseband, and even after the data itself are 
recovered. The latter generally only applies where the detailed characteristics of 
interference modulation are known to some degree [1]. Figure 8.5 illustrates a de­
sired signal, C, and two potential interferers, I1 and I2. The various stages are areas 
where cancellation could potentially be introduced, to be discussed in the following 
paragraphs. Cancellation of more than one interferer will require greater complex­
ity such as more antenna elements (e.g., a phased array) or digital processing in the 
subsequent elements of the receive chain. Furthermore, cancellation after demodu­
lation and detection requires knowledge of the interfering signal. This presumes a 
somewhat closed system with controlled access.
8.3.1  Cancellation at RF (Antenna)
RFI can be canceled at RF provided that its energy can be recovered separately from 
the desired carrier. Cancellation can in fact be near perfect and yield a signal that is 
clear of the RFI. Figure 8.6 shows the simple block diagram of a receiving system 
to cancel RFI entering in a particular sidelobe of the receive antenna. The carrier, 
C, is received by the communications antenna through the main lobe; therefore, 
it has sufficient power to overcome the noise in the receiving system on the right. 
There is an interfering carrier, I1, entering through the first sidelobe below the main 
beam. We have at the input to the RF equipment the desired carrier and the RFI, 
with the ratio of carrier to interference being C/I1. By pointing an auxiliary antenna 
at the RFI (in the same direction as the sidelobe in question), the interfering carrier, 
I1, can be recovered by itself and with only a residual amount of the desired carrier 
power. The sample of the RFI is received separately and adjusted in amplitude and 
phase so that it can be subtracted from the carrier plus RFI coming from the RF 
equipment. The purpose of the loop with the X and integrating filter is to perform 
this correction in an optimal manner, subtracted in a processing loop. Any residual 
energy of the desired carrier via the auxiliary antenna will result in a reduction of 
Figure 8.5  RFI is introduced within the receive antenna through the main beam or sidelobes. RFI 
cancellation techniques are possible at any level in the reception process, from within the antenna 
and feed (RF), the intermediate frequency where the signals are still modulated; after demodulation 
or detection, cancellation involves detailed knowledge of data characteristics and/or some form of 
access control [1].

carrier power, C. The technique in Figure 8.6 derives from a radar receiver [2 ] but 
has more general application in radiocommunication.
The complexity of the RF processor and modulation circuit (shown as a circle 
with an X) will depend on the nature of the signals and environment. If the signals 
are stationary in time, all that is required is that the amplitude and phase of the 
interfering carrier be adjusted to match the interference as it comes through the 
main antenna. This produces subtraction in the circle shown prior to the receiver. 
There is a commercial satellite communications technique that provides for can­
cellation of a carrier using an adaptive approach. Termed “carrier-in-carrier,” the 
concept is to allow two Earth stations to transmit to each other to provide a duplex 
point-to-point link. The carriers are transferred over a bent-piper repeater within 
the same area-coverage satellite beam. Normally, the carriers must be on different 
frequencies so that reception of the opposite end’s carrier is not jammed by one’s 
own carrier. In carrier-in-carrier, both stations transmit on the same frequency but 
use cancellation (at IF) to remove the RFI. This is possible because each end knows 
what its own signal is at any instant and can thus cancel it out on receive. The mo­
dem on each end is presented with the received carrier with a sufficient C/N, with 
only residual RFI, for the process of demodulation.
A phased-array antenna system offers the opportunity to include RFI cancel­
lation within the requirements and capability of the original design [6]. Even the 
two-element array in Figure 8.7 has the ability to cancel one RFI source. The same 
signal is received by both antennas and adds constructively for the desired carrier. 
Cancellation occurs at the off-angle toward the interference (see Figure 2.28) [3].
For the two-element example in Figure 8.7, the amplitude and phase adjust­
ment “weighting factors” for each of the two elements can be expressed in complex 
form by

The equations show that the jammer is removed at the jammer center fre­

the jammer power spectral density is 40 dB greater than that of the internal noise, 
performance is degraded by approximately 12 dB at the edge of a bandwidth 3% 
of the jammer center frequency. Generally speaking, the degree of cancellation de­
pends upon
••
Element spacing and size of array (number of elements),
••
Interference signal bandwidth.
••
Mutual coupling and mismatch among elements of the array, and
••
Propagation delay across the array aperture (limiting the maximum effective 
aperture).
RF cancellation can be applied to almost any signal and RFI type because it ad­
dresses the modulated carrier in free space. Also, it can be introduced into the sys­
tem after it is already in operation provided that suitable antennas can be installed. 
The approach of beam-nulling has been applied for almost as long as radiocom­
munication has existed, and improvements have employed adaptive technology to 
address dynamic RFI conditions.
8.3.2  Cancellation at IF
Cancellation of IF signals proceeds in much the same way as RF since the carriers 
contain their original modulation (i.e., predetection cancellation). The dominant 
approach today is perform A/D conversion on the entire IF band and rely on com­
plex digital processing to select the desired carrier and accomplish all processing 
including detection and decoding. This approach also allows the greatest complex­
ity in terms of matching the relative gain and phase of signal and RFI. It would 
be possible to attempt cancellation based on expected characteristics of the RFI, 
something that can be updated through external means of measurement. There 
could be some difficulty achieving the accuracy needed for good cancellation be­
cause of gain and phase variation in the analog devices in the frequency translation 
and amplification stages between the RF section and the processor. A phased array 
that accomplishes phase and amplitude combining at IF and after A/D conversion 

178

offers the means to enhance signal and cancel noise as well. A system such as this 
can include adaptive channel characterization to improve suppression of channel 
noise and impairments.
8.3.3  Cancellation at Baseband (Postdetection)
Baseband cancellation occurs after demodulation and therefore requires knowledge 
of the RFI signal structure. It can be applied in either a homogeneous environment 
or in those heterogeneous environments where the RFI is coming from well-known 
sources. This is the case where the RFI is static or where the cause is another li­
censed and standardized operation, such as from other wireless operators or in the 
case of sharing of spectrum between a limited set of user types. Modern cellular net­
works are now designed based on the levels of internal and external RFI as opposed 
to thermal noise. Conventional thermal noise can be overcome by transmitting at a 
higher power, but higher levels of RFI result and that becomes the limiting factor in 
cellular networks. RFI cancellation is an important means of increasing the quantity 
of users in a given space and of increasing the throughput data that each is afforded.
Baseband processing avoids the calibration issues associated with the analog 
sections of the receiving station. It would be most appropriate within a structured 
RF network environment. A network with a central hub or under control of a base 
station would be a candidate. Such networks, including most terrestrial wireless 
networks as well as VSAT networks over GEO satellites, have two types of links:
••
Base station to user terminal, called the forward or outbound link (the uplink 
in cellular networks) and
••
User terminal to base station, called the return or inbound link (the downlink 
in cellular networks).
There is a third type of called mesh or point-to-point link that avoids connec­
tion to a hub station. The use of the terms uplink and downlink to describe the 
forward and return links, respectively, is an item of confusion for those in satel­
lite communications since the hub Earth station and the user VSAT terminal each 
have respective uplinks and downlinks. So, we will use the more general terms of 
forward (hub transmit) and return (remote transmit) links in the current discus­
sion. Forward links use the principle of digital code orthogonality of base-to-user 
transmissions because all are synchronized. Return links come from unsynchro­
nized transmitters, however, and hence cannot employ orthogonality to reduce RFI 
impacts.
Terrestrial wireless networks generally use some form of spread-spectrum 
transmission to simplify assignment of channels to cells and to reduce RFI. Gener­
ally speaking, the forward direction is the easier to deal with since, in a given cell, 
there is one dominant forward carrier and RFI is caused by a few distant base 
stations transmitting their respective forward carriers on the same frequency. The 
user terminal receiver then only has to cancel RFI from a limited number of sources 
(e.g., one or two). On the other hand, the fact that there are many user terminals 
transmitting return carriers, which are transmitted independently of each, results in 
a more difficult RFI control environment. Mitigating this factor is that the receiver 

8.3  Interference Cancellation 
179
is now at the base station and can be more complex and sophisticated in terms of 
its ability to process and potentially remove RFI. The base station can employ mul­
tiple receivers of greater complexity to decode all desired and potentially interfer­
ing signals and perform the type of cancelling that is to be discussed. 
Modern wireless systems are employing antennas that are based on the concept 
of multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO). A MIMO antenna might have four 
beams that cover some angular range. Each antenna connects to its own receive 
chain, which is typical of how sectors were laid out in the past. The connections 
are made through some type of phase and amplitude combining network similar 
to what is shown in Figure 8.7 for two elements or Figure 2.26 for seven elements, 
however. We have discussed how RF cancellation can be used to null the pattern 
in a specific direction. The context here, however, is for systems where interference 
cancellation is done at baseband after demodulation. This improves data quality in 
the same way as forward error correction but does it by processing samples of the 
RFI to enhance the recovered data.
There appear to be two viable approaches to interference cancellation at base­
band: parallel interference cancellation (PIC) and successive interference cancella­
tion (SIC), illustrated in Figures 8.8 and 8.9, respectively [1]. As shown in Figure 
8.8, PIC is characterized in that all users are detected individually and processed si­
multaneously. The technique can be repeated to improve cancellation (in much the 
same manner as turbo codes do). The initial very course estimate may be used to 
cancel some of the interference, allowing parallel detection to be repeated. Because 
of this repetition, PIC has been referred to as multistage interference cancellation. 
Soft interference cancellation is necessary since the first state usually results in very 
noisy data estimates. 
SIC, shown in Figure 8.9, detects one user per stage, where the strongest signal 
is detected first and used to cancel itself out of later stages that detect the weaker 
signals. The received signal for each signal is reconstructed by recreating the trans­
mit signal, allowing subsequent users to experience a cleaner signal. All users have 
improved performance because the earlier user starts with a stronger signal while 
later users experience better cancellation of this same stronger signal.

timate may be used to cancel some interference, followed by repeated parallel cancellation. (Repro­
duced from [1] with permission.)

180

How to Identify, Prevent, and Fix Common RFI problems
PIC has decreased latency because all users must be processed in parallel; but 
increased complexity because there must be a quantity of cancellation stages for 
each user as well. In contrast, SIC only requires one stage per user, reducing com­
plexity; latency increases at the same time because of the sequential nature of pro­
cessing (i.e., one stage after another). The analysis shows that if all users are equal 
in power (a condition rarely met in practice), PIC has superior performance; how­
ever, SIC wins out in the real-world where power levels vary. This imbalance of 
power can be exploited in the system by assigning users at cell boundaries a lower 
power to reduce interference caused to their neighboring cells.
In summary, base station return-channel receivers need to suppress RFI from 
many independent user transmitters, in contrast to forward-channel receivers in 
user terminals that must be able to suppress interference from just a few neighbor­
ing cells. The latter employ a single antenna or at most two antennas and so RF 
cancellation is not available as a part of the solution. The benefit will be the reduc­
tion in the required distance between cells operating on the same frequency or an 
increase in throughput within the same cell.
Work continues in the wireless arena to address RFI as the primary limita­
tion of coverage and service capability. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project 
(3GPP™) is studying Network-Assisted Interference Cancellation and Suppression 
(NAIC) as a primary means to boost capacity in denser cell deployment [4]. This 
is because cochannel interference, either from independent intercell or coordinated 
intracell users is expected to become the limiting factor for achieving higher net­
work capacity. The idea is to increase the role of the receiver to achieve interference 
rejection combining (IRC) in user equipment, applying network assistance where 
appropriate. The tradeoff in evaluating various IRC receiver structures include: 
performance, complexity, network coordination, and network signaling. The block 
diagram of the link abstraction model for one form of IRC receiving system is given 
in Figure 8.10. This covers the Link-to-System  (L2S) as applied to system-level 
interference cancellation (SLIC), described by Andrews [1] as NAIC.
According to 3GPP, synchronous network deployment is assumed for NAIC 
receivers but receiver performance degradation from timing, frequency synchro­
nization error and asynchronous deployment is for future study. Another area for 
Figure 8.9  Successive interference cancellation, which detects just one user per stage. The stron­
gest received signal is detected first, then the next strongest, and so on. (Reproduced from [1] with

future study is misalignment of control regions and whether better network signal­
ing or UE detection of interference are needed. The trend then involves intelligence 
in network management and improved signal waveforms that are more resilient to 
RFI.
8.4  RFI as an Incident Needing Effective Tools and Management 
Section 1.4 provides an introduction to active management to resolve an RFI situ­
ation. In addition, the technical and operational bases of RFI characterization and 
performance impact have been reviewed in the previous chapters; we now become 
engaged in the vital process of rapid response to achieve the necessary cure. The 
specifics of the process will differ from case to case, necessitating a tailored plan of 
action but managed by those who understand these ground rules. There are mod­
ern methodologies, discussed next, that improve on what Sherlock Holmes, that 
imaginary genius of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, might have considered in his day over 
100 years ago.
We should consider active RFI to be an “incident” in the context of emergency 
preparedness—for a given incident there must be a team to create and conduct 
its resolution, and there must be an incident commander. According to the US 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), “The Incident Commander has 
overall responsibility for managing the incident by establishing objectives, plan­
ning strategies, and implementing tactics.” [5] The process of incident command 
has become well established in the U.S. emergency management domain and those 
who have employed it successfully see its profound benefits. Without a command 
structure, the incident will probably not be completely resolved and lead to yet 
worse problems. It may not be apparent from the system behavior that RFI, in fact, 
is the cause. This is especially the case with user- installed equipment such as Wi-Fi 
access points and satellite TV receiving antennas, and microwave links operating 
around national borders where knowledge of neighboring country operations may 
be limited.
The general principle of technical troubleshooting is that of deductive reason­
ing, summarized by Doyle, via Sherlock Holmes, stating, “Eliminate the impossible 
and whatever remains, however improbably, must be the truth.” The strength of 
this precept can be found in Doyle’s classic story, The Red Headed League among 
others. We get to this desirable point by identifying all possible causes through 
the process of brainstorming with the right people and using methodologies such 
as fault trees, failure mode and effects (FMEA, not to be confused with FEMA, 
the U.S. emergency management agency) analysis and Pareto charts. According to 
Warwick University [6], we use fault tree analysis to
••
Examine the system from top-down;
••
Provide graphical symbols for ease of understanding;
••
Incorporate mathematical tools to focus on critical areas.
The fault tree identifies the cause and FMEA allows us to choose the best means 
of resolution. The academic approach, part of the field of industrial engineering, 

8.4  RFI as an Incident Needing Effective Tools and Management  
183
tends toward the mathematical/computational and can inform us on the value of 
alternative approaches. 
At the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Pareto charts and other tools are the 
kit needed to address any problem in the industrial engineering domain. According 
to their guidelines [7]: 
This tool is based on the Pareto principle, which states that in a given situation, a 
small number of causes (usually 20% of the total) account for most of the prob­
lems (usually 80% of the total). Often called the “80/20 Rule,” the Pareto concept 
suggests that you can get the greatest results for the least amount of effort by 
identifying and focusing on a few key issues. It requires collecting and organizing 
data into root causes or categories of causes. The data are then displayed in a bar 
chart [histogram] to give a visual representation of the relative importance of the 
root causes. A cumulative percentage line shows the contribution of each category 
to the total problem.
However, to avoid suffering “analysis paralysis,” there must be action-oriented 
leadership (discussed next) and the use of action items to provide details and fur­
ther investigation of alternatives. Only then can the cause be identified along with 
the best approach to resolution. It is not enough to identify root causes and po­
tential forms of resolution; this is not just an exercise in knowing that a solution 
“exists.” We must move from the study into corrective action. To make this work, 
we have certain critical management functions (read, leadership and control): 
••
Incident command: Sets the incident objectives, strategies, and priorities and 
has overall responsibility for the incident;
••
Operations: Conducts operations to reach the incident objectives. Establishes 
the tactics and directs all operational resources;
••
Planning: Supports the incident action planning process by tracking re­
sources, collecting/analyzing information, and maintaining documentation;
••
Logistics: Provides resources and needed services to support the achievement 
of the incident objectives;
••
Finance and aministration: Monitors costs related to the incident. Provides 
accounting, procurement, time recording, and cost analyses.
FEMA adopted the Incident Management System (IMS) to improve the rapid 
response of emergency resources that come from different agencies and groups. 
The key is coordination of efforts, elimination of duplication and gaps, and im­
provement of information availability during troubled times. For the typical RFI 
incident, we can probably focus on the first three or four functions, leaving part 
of logistics and finance and accounting to an existing administrative structure. (In­
cidentally, “logistics” includes emergency communications, using radio and other 
means.) Command and control, operations, and planning are key to a successful 
response and correction of RFI issues that affect a working radiocommunication 
system.
Frequent physical and virtual meetings are an effective means of brainstorm­
ing, generating action items, and creating data and tactics for evaluation by the

can be addressed once we understand its causes. We include the basic means of tak­
ing corrective action: frequency planning, physical separation filtering and shield­
ing, and very important, RFI cancellation.

Prospective for RFI Resolution in Future 
Radiocommunication Systems
We have presented an extensive body of knowledge about RFI characterization and 
methods for its resolution in the wide range of radiocommunication systems and 
networks, both terrestrial and satellite. As discussed in many places, our ability to 
address this problem continues to improve but there are challenges as new systems 
are added and the demand for spectrum increases. It is a truism that the spectrum 
resource is limited; however, schemes exist that could multiply the effective capacity 
of this spectrum. This needs to be done in the recognition that RFI cannot be ig­
nored but most be a central design criterion and, in most cases, occupies a dominant 
place in the engineer’s and planner’s minds. The paragraphs that follow provide cur­
rent innovations being advanced, studied and experimented with. We also offer our 
thoughts on RFI resolution futures—how smarter radios and control systems can 
provide more services at higher speeds to the diverse operator and user community.
9.1  New Approaches to Interference Management
Historical and current approaches to interference management can best be sum­
marized by either of two words: avoidance or tolerance. In avoidance, the sharing 
of the same band amounts to one user not causing unacceptable or harmful inter­
ference to another (typically by segmenting the band or restricting operation to a 
particular geographic area). The victim system operates without any significant 
interference from the potentially interfering source. Under the tolerance mode, the 
victim accepts a limited amount of interference into the link budget of their system, 
which will require some amount of additional power or improved threshold recep­
tion performance. It might be measured in terms of an equivalent increase in ther­
mal background noise (say 6%), an equivalent entry in terms of C/I, or some impact 
of service performance such as an increase in bit error (say by 10%). As long as the 
system causing interference constrains it operation to stay below the criterion, they 
may operate independently. What may be wasteful about either approach is that 
a worst case is assumed about the presence of interference; in practice and under 
many conditions, interference is either well below the allowable level or has no 
practical effect whatsoever.

186 
�������������������������������������������������������������������
Prospective for RFI Resolution in Future Radiocommunication Systems
The new approaches to interference management are based on the inclusion of 
additional information at either the source or the victim or both, and the ability to 
process and exchange such information if available. Thus, the source acts intelli­
gently to minimize or preclude any measureable impact on the victim, or the victim 
has information about the source that allows it to remove it from the signal path 
or avoid it through some other strategy. We saw that interference cancellation in 
Chapter 8 provided some of this capability. What all of this does is to capture the 
capacity lost due to the assumption of worst cases that ignore the actual transmis­
sion characteristics and details of behavior of the system causing RFI and the victim 
as well. Making this happen is rather a challenging task as existing (incumbent) 
systems lack such resources and the new system may incur very large costs or oper­
ating limitations to “close the loop” on RFI mitigation.
Motivation to pursue these strategies comes from a capacity constraint in fu­
ture RFI environments. There is the general principle that as the number of simul­
taneous users increases and the total RFI with it, the capacity of the channel will 
saturate. [1] provides us with an application of information theory to evaluate new 
techniques against old standards. In particular, Shannon’s theorem states that the 
capacity of a communication channel in the presence of Gaussian noise is bounded 
at 






log C
N . In the interference free case (a single user-to-user path), capacity is 
increased in direct relation to carrier power. When we go to a channel with mul­
tiple users that can interfere with another, however, the capacity must be written 




+


∑
log
C
N
I . The summation contains the carrier power of individual interfering 
signals, which eventually dominate the denominator and hence define the resulting 
capacity. When RFI is introduced, capacity can only be held constant by decreasing 
N (unlikely since it is intrinsic to the receiving system) or increase C (which tends 
to increase RFI to others). CDMA systems are ones in which capacity is determined 
by this summation since all carriers occupy the same frequency and time space. As 
discussed next, researchers have identified some techniques that apply more so­
phisticated software defined radios and intelligent back-channel communications 
to open up pieces of bandwidth that otherwise are lost.
9.2  Cognitive Radio
The term cognitive radio (CR) and its concept have been around for approximately 
15 years at the time of this writing. The ITU defines CR as follows [2]:
A radio system employing technology that allows the system to obtain knowledge 
of its operational and geographical environment, established policies and its in­
ternal state; to dynamically and autonomously adjust its operational parameters 
and protocols according to its obtained knowledge in order to achieve predefined 
objectives; and to learn from the results obtained.
Actual implementation of the requisite intelligence and functionality of CR 
still lags because of its complexity and the “tyranny of inventory” posed by the 
global quantities of current non-CR radiocommunication systems. Some agencies, 

9.2  Cognitive Radio 
187
including the ITU, European telecom regulatory agencies, and the FCC, are work­
ing to see it implemented at some point. The intent is to have non-CR users op­
erating in the same spectrum and physical space as CR users. Historically, these 
would be designated in regulatory terms as primary and secondary spectrum users, 
respectively. The primary user should enjoy full use of the spectrum without harm 
or unacceptable interference from the secondary users; while the secondary users 
employ available spectrum resources in a way that does not conflict with the en­
joyment of the primary users. Further, secondary users must accept all RFI from 
primary users who operate in accordance with their licenses. We know that in the 
absence of one of the strategies given in Figure 8.1, introduction of secondary users 
can produced unacceptable RFI absent something like CR.
Simon Haykin provided clear definition and exposition on CR in his seminal 
paper published by the IEEE [3]. In it, he defines CR as:
“Cognitive radio is an intelligent wireless communication system that is aware of 
its surrounding environment (i.e., outside world), and uses the methodology of 
understanding-by-building to learn from the environment and adapt its internal 
states to statistical variations in the incoming RF stimuli by making corresponding 
changes in certain operating parameters (e.g., transmit-power, carrier-frequency, 
and modulation strategy) in real-time, with two primary objectives in mind:
·  Highly reliable communications whenever and wherever needed;
·  Efficient utilization of the radio spectrum.”
According to Haykin, six keywords stand out in this definition: awareness, 
intelligence, learning, adaptivity, reliability, and efficiency. Figure 9.1 depicts three 
elements in the cycle of a CR in operation. The first two elements are part of the 
CR receiver and the third is of the transmitter, as follows:
1.	 Radio-scene analysis, which encompasses the following:
•	 estimation of interference temperature of the radio environment;
•	 detection of spectrum holes.
2.	 Channel identification, which encompasses the following:
•	 estimation of channel-state information (CSI);
•	 prediction of channel capacity for use by the transmitter
3.	 Transmit-power control and dynamic spectrum management.
Much of this draws from our general experience with radiocommunication 
where in the past these functions were performed manually by human operators 
and, more recently, with the help of monitoring and network management systems 
(discussed in Chapter 7 and again in Section 9.3). But, the differentiator is that the 
human management and quick-reaction function is performed by what we might 
refer to as artificial intelligence (knowledge-based systems). The term “cognitive 
radio” was coined by Joseph Mitola in an article published in 1999. In it, Mitola 
described how a cognitive radio could enhance the flexibility of personal wireless 
services through a new language called the radio knowledge representation lan­
guage (RKRL) [4]. This language is part of a back channel of communication to 
transfer information about the state of the radio environment at every instant as 
well as other data relative to the non-CR users that need to be protected. One of the

more interesting possibilities is for the CR user to actually improve communication 
performance of the non-CR user, by suppressing noise or retransmitting informa­
tion of the latter to its intended receivers.
The pathway to a workable CR system is not going to be easy because of the 
complexity of the problem, the constraints on any given approach, and limitations 
on the ability to obtain needed knowledge of the instantaneous RF environment. 
Satellite communication systems are especially restricted in the latter because of 
the time delays involved. With a short time delay, it could be as simple as listening 
before transmitting; the most common approach in conventional radiocommuni­
cation and one effectively applied with Ethernet. Non-CR users, however, will not 
know of the presence of CR users and could suddenly appear in what might have 
been spectrum holes. The idea that the CR system would know what non-CR users 
are expected to do is perhaps unreasonable as they represent totally independent 
demands for communication. The way around this, of course, is to have a cen­
tral management authority with the ability to know the activity of CR users and 
control necessary aspects of non-CR users. An example in cellular radio (5G) is 
provided later in this section. We don’t need to achieve the ideal outcomes of CR 
and some of its features will, no doubt, appear in time within the structure of wire­
less systems and others that may arise as a result of capabilities offered within the 
broad domain of CR. 
CR is, after all, the marrying of all of the features of a modern radiocommu­
nication system, as discussed in Chapters 1 and 2, with the capability of a knowl­
edge-based system to add the cognitive element we need to grant access to spectrum 
holes as they appear and to protect the primary users who otherwise are unaware

channel identification, and a transmitter task of transmitter control and dynamic spectrum manage­
ment [3].

of the presence of the CR secondary users. The CR must be flexible in terms of 
modulation and coding and adapting to channel conditions and the sensitivity of 
non-CR receivers. This takes advantage of what is termed Software Defined Radio 
(SDR), a concept well ingrained into many current wireless systems. SDR allows 
the user and the network to alter the waveform along other aspects of signal trans­
mission and protocol structure. A trip around the flow in Figure 9.1 gives one the 
sense of what needs to happen and where new capabilities need to be created and 
proven in the real world.
We note that while the U.S. FCC was first to identify and promote CR as a 
creative means to add users and exploit spectrum holes, efforts followed in Europe 
through the auspices of European Committee of Posts and Telecommunications 
(CEPT) and the ITU. Not surprisingly, this broader international community came 
up with their own naming convention and style. They used the term “white spaces” 
instead of spectrum holes, offering the definition as follows. 
Definition for white space in Report 24 from CEPT (June 2008):
White space is a part of the spectrum, which is available for a radiocommunica­
tion application (service, system) at a given time in a given geographical area on a 
noninterfering/unprotected basis with regard to primary services and other services 
with a higher priority on a national basis. [5].
Sensing and subsequently protecting a primary user is the responsibility of the 
CR secondary operator. One approach is to assure the primary user that the opera­
tion of the CR will not increase their noise floor by some amount. This, of course, 
is the well-established technique covered in Section 3.1 of a percentage increase in 
equivalent link noise temperature used to determine if coordination of a new satel­
lite network is required. We are applying it now in a new and broader area. Yet, 
the technique is very conservative because the interference may occur on a different 
frequency from the protected user and at a different time as well. It will, however, 
work provided that the calculation or measurement done by the CR is valid.     
CR has considerable promise in developing intelligent radiocommunication 
systems that can evaluate the RFI environment and apply concepts from artificial 
intelligence and SDR to grab unoccupied spectrum and operate so as to minimize 
occurrence of interference. Various academicians have addressed and continue to 
address promising strategies. They also evaluate the efficiencies and capacities that 
these can attain, at least in theory. It is left to the private sector to actually imple­
ment some form of CR in a real world radiocommunication system. The fact that 
we live in an interference-limited environment and that regulators favor approach­
es that can capture resources currently “lost” in spectrum holes (or white spaces, if 
you will) provides much motivation.
Efforts to date involve current systems such as cellular and broadband where 
the user device is capable of multiple modes (i.e., 3G CDMA, 4G OFDM, Blue­
tooth, and Wi-Fi), and research continues on systems that operate in the back­
ground to improve performance. An example of an application of CR in cellular is 
for direct device-to-device (D2D) communication using cellular spectrum without 
going through a base station [6]. Like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, D2D employing cog­
nitive spectrum access (CSA) allows one device to establish a direct connection 
to another in an ad hoc manner. Instead of using a band dedicated to this mode, 

190 
�������������������������������������������������������������������
Prospective for RFI Resolution in Future Radiocommunication Systems
however, the devices can remain in the licensed cellular spectrum but operate in a 
way that does not interfere with the licensed carrier’s network. By communicating 
directly on a single-hop basis, the devices use half the spectrum they would have 
needed if a base station had been employed, and with less power provided they 
are in close proximity (typically the case with such applications). This is illustrated 
in Figure 9.2, where in (a) we have D2D in operation that is independent and 
unaware of the enhanced Node B (eNB) base station (BS) and its backhaul to the 
mobile switching center. In case (b), direct D2D communication is allowed, but it 
is managed through the standard wireless link with the base station that is aware 
of D2D services.
According to the authors in [7], “We have proposed a semi-distributed CSA 
solution in which cognition at the D2D terminals allows interference-aware deci­
sion making and limited control at the BSs helps the D2D users in selecting the 
spectrum band with the least interference.” They describe allowing simultaneous 
D2D and cellular communication in the same spectrum (i.e., “in band” communi­
cation). There are challenges involving interference management among the coex­
isting cellular and D2D users along with the need for a low-complexity centralized 
or semi-distributed spectrum access and interference mitigation techniques with 
minimal signaling overheads, and the notion of priority for the resource manage­
ment of D2D and cellular user equipment. They suggest a tiered approach rather 
than all-in with CR. This is because the complexity of CR may only be needed un­
der conditions of excessive RFI or traffic loading. The rest of the time, D2D users 
can transmit in spectrum holes that appear static while cellular users continue to 
operate with their associated base station sites. The overhead associated with CR, 
requiring communication between D2D users and the base stations, will probably 
result in less resource for their use; however, they will have access and the ability to 
transfer some quantity of data.
Spectrum sharing between cellular users and D2D pairs allows higher spectrum 
reuse. However, it may lead to severe cross-tier interference at D2D links when they 
coexist with cellular users and small cell tiers in a multi-tier cellular network. The 
concept of multitier celluar is part of the forthcoming body of standards. Accord­
ing to Ekram Hossain, 5G systems will adopt a multitier architecture consisting 
of macrocells, different types of licensed small cells, relays, and D2D networks to 
serve users with different quality-of-service (QoS) requirements in a spectrum and

out network control or with network control. (From [5], with permission.)

energy-efficient manner [7]. The variety of multitier networks, including cellular 
and D2D users, is presented in Figure 9.3. We see a variety of types of coverage, 
including a macrocell for the broad region along with smaller pico- and femto-cells 
that address urban areas and individual buildings/homes respectively. User equip­
ment (UE) may connect through the base stations associated with these cells; in 
addition, one UE device can connect directly to another (D2D) using cellular spec­
trum but with a CR function managed through the macrocell. 
Worth mentioning is the growing role of MIMO antenna systems as a means to 
modify these coverage areas in response to occupancy and service demands [8]. In 
5G, MIMO is expected to play a significant role as it increases spectrum efficiency 
with phased arrays that can generate hundreds of antenna beams on the fly. The 
cellular users have priority to access the channels over the D2D users; in particular, 
the channels for the cellular users are fixed allocated to them. Pairs of D2D users 
access the cellular users’ radio resource under the condition that the cellular users’ 
services are not disrupted. With MIMO antennas, it is well understood that power 
control and precoding are an effective means to mitigate interference. Perfect chan­
nel state information at the transmitter is usually not possible in practical MIMO 
wireless networks, where the base station uses an array with hundreds of active 
antennas to serve tens of users on the same time/frequency resources by coherent 
precoding. There is added cost in terms of hardware to achieve a MIMO base sta­
tion complex.
The rich environment proposed in Figure 9.3 leads to a need to assess how well 
D2D with CSA can perform in realistic terms. Figure 9.4 presents the probability 
of successful access to spectrum in terms of the channel access probability (CAP). 
Two policy strategies are proposed:
••
D2D-unaware spectrum access (DUSA): A base station can utilize any chan­
nel to serve any cellular user based only on its scheduling policy, whereas 
each D2D pair selects a random channel.
••
D2D-aware spectrum access (DASA): A base station first assigns one of the 
channels (say cd) for D2D transmissions and exchanges the ID of this channel 
with the D2D users in its coverage area over the standard LTE user to user 
interface. Once the D2D users are informed of the D2D channel, they are 
responsible for initiating the communication session by exchanging control 
and data signals with no further supervision from the BS. This channel is not 
exclusive for D2D users and can be used for cellular transmissions.
In Figure 9.4 [6], cognition improves the CAP for a D2D transmit terminal for 
both the DUSA and DASA strategies. Cognition is most effective in dense networks 
where RFI is greatest, however. For example, the improvement in CAP with DUSA 
due to cognition is only 3% (i.e., from 0.85 to 0.87) when the density of CUE is 
10 CUEs/km2 compared to 85 percent (i.e., from 0.29 to 0.53) when the density of 
CUEs is 50 users/km2. This result suggests that CSA is not crucial when the number 
of CUEs is low and the D2D TXs have a good chance of finding free channels. On 
the other hand, for dense networks, CSA is crucial to avoid the nearby interferers 
and increase the efficiency of using the available resources.

One of the promises of CR as conceived early on was some means of the new 
CR system actually improving the ability of non-CR users to transfer their informa­
tion. A way to accomplish this is to reduce the total noise within the band of the 
non-CR user. This is done with a new regime called transform-domain communi­
cation system (TDCS) that removes its energy from areas where there is or could 
be other carrier energy. In a basic TDCS implementation, spectral interference and 
friendly signal presence are estimated using Fourier-based or general spectral esti­
mation techniques. According to the Air Force Institute of Technology [14], TDCS 
would accomplish the following: 
Once frequency bands containing interference or other signals are identified, 
typically through estimation and threshold detection, those bands are effectively 
notched (removed) prior to creating the time-domain fundamental modulation 
waveform (FMW) using the appropriate inverse transform (e.g., inverse discrete 
Fourier transform, DFT). Data then modulates the FMW to generate the digitally 
encoded waveforms. Since the FMW is spectrally synthesized to specifically avoid 
interference regions, transmitted communication symbols do not contain energy at 
spectral interference locations, and received symbols are largely unaffected.
This is different from assigning carriers to RFI-free frequencies as suggested 
in Chapter 8. Instead, the system automatically senses or predicts RFI locations 
and then modulates carriers with spectral holes or gaps that overlay those areas 
of trouble (e.g., occupancy by non-CR users). A way to achieve this is to use con­
ventional spread-spectrum CDMA but to adapt the spectrum to the presence of 
RFI. Conventional time-domain matched filtering and maximum likelihood (ML)

tive spectrum access (CSA) [6].

detection estimation are employed at the receiver. It is interesting to note that the 
idea of notching CDMA signals was proposed by Dr. Larry Milstein of University 
of California, San Diego, in a presentation he made to the IEEE prior to 2000 [16].
We have briefly explored the concept and structure of CR based on the theory 
and one possible application in cellular wireless systems. The logical ability of CR 
to employ spectrum holes cannot be disputed. However, the challenge still remains 
to find ready applications including the needed intelligence and communication to 
provide immediate information about the RFI environment and the sensitivities of 
non-CR occupants. Ideally, CR is a way to employ the common band approach 
given in Figure 8.1 and still manage RFI as part of providing an acceptable service 
to all who require it.
9.3  Spectrum Management Tools and Resources
Our review in Section 7.1 of current spectrum analysis and monitoring devices and 
systems establishes the basis for knowing the current status of desired signals as 
well as RFI within the spectrum of interest. Discussions of interference cancellation, 
spectrum sharing and CR provide some hope for new methodologies to mitigate 
interference effects and increase utility of and access to valuable spectrum. We now 
move in this section to the regulatory side of the equation to see how international 
and national agencies may apply the tools, some of which are still experimental and 
some which are purely theoretical at this point in time. The conclusion addresses 
advanced concepts in spectrum monitoring and RFI remediation.
9.3.1  Licensed Shared Access
The ITU identified future benefits to the use of CR in managing access to spectrum, 
including the following deployment scenarios [5]:
••
Reconfiguration of connections between terminals and multiple radio 
systems; 
••
Technology to improve the management of its assigned spectrum resources;
••
Use of CR technology as an enabler of cooperative spectrum access;
••
Use of CR technology as an enabler of opportunistic spectrum access.
Licensed shared access (LSA) represents an advanced approach to licensing 
spectrum to users employing principles of CR to more efficiently employ spectrum 
and control RFI at the same time. It is defined by the ITU in the following manner: 
A regulatory approach aiming to facilitate the introduction of radiocommunica­
tion systems operated by a limited number of licensees under an individual licens­
ing regime in a frequency band already assigned or expected to be assigned to one 
or more incumbent users. Under the Licensed Shared Access (LSA) approach, the 
additional users are authorized to use the spectrum (or part of the spectrum) in 
accordance with sharing rules included in their rights of use of spectrum, thereby 
allowing all the authorized users, including incumbents, to provide a certain Qual­
ity of Service (QoS)

9.3  Spectrum Management Tools and Resources 
195
In general, LSA aims at a certain guarantee in terms of spectrum access and 
protection against harmful interference for both incumbent and new LSA licensees, 
thus allowing them to provide a respective quality of service. LSA excludes con­
cepts such as “opportunistic spectrum access” (listed above), “secondary use” or 
“secondary service” where the applicant has no protection from primary user(s). 
LSA licensees and incumbents operate different applications and are subject to dif­
ferent regulatory constraints. They would each have exclusive individual access to 
spectrum at a given location and time. It’s hard to disagree with these objectives; 
achieving them will require much of what CR intends to provide.
CEPT is perusing LSA from a uniquely European perspective, claiming that 
LSA assists addressing the market demand for harmonized introduction of new 
applications in specific bands characterized by fragmented incumbent uses which 
have to be maintained in different countries. The latter (fragmented incumbent 
uses) refers to old legacy radiocommunication systems that might even employ 
analog modulation and operate independently of one another (e.g., taxi radios 
and private point-to-point microwave links). National administrations therefore 
require some flexibility in the national implementation to enable the protection of 
incumbent services. In the past, a new service provider might have to compensate 
the incumbent who must move to a new band or use different technology. A CEPT 
harmonization measure would designate a frequency band and define harmonized 
conditions of use (e.g. waveforms, radio interface). The first practical use cases of 
LSA will be to provide access to additional spectrum for mobile broadband services 
(MFCN) for the frequency band 2.3-2.4 GHz. The incumbents could be accom­
modate by providing them with the CR-capable radios they need to continue to 
operate in the LSA environment.
9.3.2  Model Cities Demonstrations
A program is being developed at the time of this writing in the United States to 
demonstrate how CR and/or LSA would work in a particular area or set of applica­
tions. The U.S. FCC and NTIA, the agencies responsible for civil and government 
frequency assignment, respectively, have the objective of turning some government 
spectrum to commercial use under a program called Model Cities. The approach is 
to create a public-private partnership (PPP) in a given city wherein some underuti­
lized spectrum can be exploited through techniques such as CR. The statement in 
the Federal Register is as follows [9]: 
…establish a public-private partnership to facilitate the creation of an urban test 
city that would support rapid experimentation and development of policies, un­
derlying technologies, and system capabilities for advanced, dynamic spectrum 
sharing. The test services (referenced herein as a ‘‘Model City’’) for demonstrating 
and evaluating advanced spectrum sharing technologies could include large-scale 
sustainable facilities for systems-level testing in real-world environments across 
multiple frequency bands, including public safety and selected federal bands. . . .  
The FCC’s experimental licensing program makes spectrum available to any non-
federal party interested in experimenting with new radio technologies, equipment 
designs, radio wave propagation characteristics, and innovative service concepts 
(including market trials), especially in new innovation zones.

196 
�������������������������������������������������������������������
Prospective for RFI Resolution in Future Radiocommunication Systems
The reference to “new innovation zones” is to efforts by the FCC to grant 
licenses in possibly deprived areas such as cities affected by economic downturn. 
Initiated in 2014, the Model Cities program is still in the developmental stage but 
demonstrates the keen interest of government regulators in seeing something of this 
kind work in practice.
A Model City workshop was held at the FCC in April of 2015 at which govern­
ment interacted with the private sector [10]. The DoD, which is the incumbent of 
the subject spectrum at 3.5 GHz, had something to say about how they needed this 
process to be conducted [11]. Currently, they enjoy primary and sole user status, 
allowing them to assign frequencies to DoD users without much regard to external 
RFI sources. Desirous of seeing a successful introduction of a viable commercial 
service, they nevertheless expected an engineering process that offers reasonable 
protection to DoD use in a shared band. The body proposed an orderly structure 
and process, as indicated in Figure 9.5. The approach provides for thorough evalu­
ation of proposals under the direction of an impartial third party in the form of the 
National Institutes of Science and Technology. The National Advanced Spectrum 
and Communications Test Network (NASCTN) was established by the Depart­
ment of Commerce (NIST and NTIA) in 2015 in order to organize a national 
network of Federal, academic, and commercial test facilities that would provide 
testing, modeling and analysis necessary to develop and deploy spectrum-sharing 
technologies and inform future spectrum policy and regulations. A key mission is 
to create a trusted capability for federal, academic and industry spectrum users to 
facilitate spectrum sharing studies; optimize access to engineering capabilities; and 
engage federal, academic, and industry spectrum users in active collaboration.
Alcatel Lucent, which includes what was once Bell Laboratories, is assembling 
their own testbed to evaluate spectrum sharing in the 3.5-GHz band discussed in

Section 6.4.1 and mentioned above. Figure 9.6 presents the basic elements un­
der evaluation, including the incumbent 3.5-GHz government (Navy) radar and 
proposed access for licensed LTE and unlicensed Wi-Fi. In it, we see a 3.5-GHz 
prototype “small cell” connected to a network on one side and to separate base sta­
tions for LTE and Wi-Fi. Also shown is a Naval radar operating in the same band. 
This is more comprehensive than the testing by NTIA because it includes back end 
functions and a scheme for managing service in a manner to protect the Naval ra­
dar from operation of commercial users. Recall from Section 6.4.1 that there are 
conditions where the LTE user downlink is detrimentally affected by operation of 
the radar while interference to the radar was not evaluated in the particular tests.
Critical to Alcatel Lucent’s operation is the Spectrum Access Server (SAS), 
which provides the following functions:
••
Activation of exclusion zone for a spectrum chunk;
••
Vacating of commercial users operating in an interrupted spectrum chunk;
••
Reassignment of channels to commercial users;
••
Tiered access;
••
Aggregation of sensing data.
This all sounds very good but the proof will come as testing goes forward and 
eventually as real projects unfold. We saw that ATC and spectrum sharing between 
radar and LTE can be problematic owing to the level of RFI and its effect on victim 
receivers (some of which may not be part of either radiocommunication system). 
Adding a layer of spectrum management, with CR capabilities, can mitigate much 
of the RFI. But, there must be restrictions on power levels, spectrum occupancy in 
certain circumstances, and the quantity of users on both sides of the sharing space. 
We still have the situation that RFI to one end is communication to the other. Us­
ers that already enjoy their services will find it difficult to accept new entrants who 
operate in different and potentially interfering ways. Generally, it requires a more 
powerful authority that can impose new rules and require that incumbents accept 
some level of RFI or operating restrictions even if they had clear bandwidth in the

past. The latter can be expected to do this provided that the pain is manageable. 
The new comers, on the other hand, need to understand what the restrictions on 
their use means to the applications they provide or employ. This appears to be an 
objective of the Model City program, where the various sides come together in a 
test case that foretells a successful offering of services. While the results may be 
encouraging for the particular case under investigation, we have to be careful not 
to generalize about something as complex as spectrum sharing using CR or other 
unproven scheme that looks good on paper.
The Defense Research Projects Agency (DARPA), made famous by its support 
of ARPAnet that evolved into the Internet, has considered the use of CR in a de­
fense context. Here, the object is to achieve a fault tolerant radiocommunication 
system that provides diverse and automated routing much like that of the Internet 
Protocol family [11]. This is the DARPA Wireless Network After Next (WNaN) 
cognitive radio program, among whose objectives are:
1.	 A network that will adapt to the mission and organization to responsively 
conduct traffic flow and QoS across the entire range of tactical dynamics, 
network size, and network density;
2.	 The architecture that will create the best mission topology rather than 
passively accepting network topology and routing provided by existing 
systems;
3.	 In addition to a variety of multi-use network capabilities, WNaN will pro­
vide Disruptive Tolerant Networking (DTN) as a native mode.
Someone who has been around DoD advanced research and development for a 
long time will recognize much of this as the standard wish list. However, we may be 
at the point where critical aspects are within reach. One of these facilities is DTN, 
which can be defined as follows:
The delay and disruption tolerant network demonstrated the benefits of hop by 
transport of contents, and the use of adaptive caching and persistence within wire­
less networks.
This recognizes that radiocommunication must provide real-time access for the 
broad range of uses, but there are cases where some delay is allowable but with 
guaranteed delivery.
9.3.3  Spectrum Monitoring and RFI Remediation
The programs and objectives described previously in this chapter take us from the 
current environment of operating restrictions and spectrum limitations to one that 
offers more services in less spectrum. Theoretically, this can work and much has 
been done to define and quantify the characteristics and benefits. But, the techni­
cal resources to achieve this are daunting; in addition, the systems to provide these 
must be more information-intensive and coordinated than we currently see. These 
will increase in importance in the wireless systems that much of the world’s popula­
tion depends on. Likewise, terrestrial fixed and satellite systems need better capa­
bilities that are perhaps more static in nature. However, greater crowding in these 

9.3  Spectrum Management Tools and Resources

systems will require better RFI mitigation resources, enumerated next (but this is 
not a complete list):
Some of the capabilities needed now in RFI identification and resolution could 
include:
••
Improved spectrum analysis that can display signals in both frequency and 
time, adjusting automatically and dynamically, without human intervention;
••
Measuring signal power by integrating spectra and waveforms, suggesting 
the nature of the modulation or material modulating the signal;
••
Ability to compile a database of signals, automatically indexing signals 
and providing a clear user interface to better understand both desired and 
undesired signals (being sure the characteristics are clearly displayed and 
recorded);
••
Using a knowledge-based system to suggest most likely sources of RFI and 
approaches for resolution;
••
Improved interference location with high accuracy and fast response;
••
Means to interconnect various radiocommunication operators and users in 
a network that provides situational awareness and direction for identifying 
and removing RFI.
The last item recognizes that even with better RFI analysis and resolution tools, 
we still need excellent communication to “get the word out” when service is dis­
rupted from an unknown RFI source. We are sure that these capabilities and more 
will arise in coming months and years. The fact that communications have largely 
gone “wireless” provides motivation to technology providers to be as innovative 
in this area as we have seen them to be in social networks and smart phones apps.
Underlying these innovations is the basic precept that the party being interfered 
with will experience a loss of some kind. This can be measured in a variety of terms:
••
Degradation of the quality of service, as indicated above;
••
If that quality of service is not acceptable to the end user, then the victim 
operator must make adjustments in its operation. The strategies to do this 
include:
•	 Increase power
•	 Reduce the data rate to maintain quality of service
•	 Change the modulation and coding, which may result in a reduction in 
data rate
•	 Change the technology platform to take advantage of innovations
As suggested in the first bullet, RFI that produces service degradation makes 
the service less attractive to users or potentially unsuitable for the application. In 
the second bullet, we see a cost burden on the operator that would be passed on 
to the consumer and/or cause the radiocommunication system to not meet service 
needs.
The above is not meant as a condemnation of methods being perused along 
such lines as Licensed Shared Access or Model Cities. In fact, it demonstrates the 

200

wisdom of moving methodically through the evaluations of strategies and busi­
ness models. Our optimism for beneficial changes to how spectrum is allocated 
and managed are evident in a heuristic called Cooper’s Law. Similar in concept to 
Moore’s Law, related to the density of transistors on a chip, Cooper’s Law states 
that “the number of ‘conversations’ (voice or data) that can theoretically be con­
ducted over a given area in all of the useful radio spectrum. It turns out that this 
number has doubled every two-and-a-half years for the past 104 years.” This ob­
servation was made by Martin Cooper, Chairman Emeritus of ArrayComm [17]. 
Radiocommunication is one of our technology domains where innovation has been 
and remains a powerful force.
