About the Author
Marsha Collier spends most of her time on something related to eBay. She’s 
a charter-member eBay PowerSeller as well as one of the original instructors
for eBay University. As a columnist, an author of four best-selling books on
eBay, a television and radio expert, and a lecturer, she shares her knowledge
of eBay with millions of online shoppers. Thousands of eBay fans also visit
her Web site, www.coolebaytools.com, to get Marsha’s latest insights on 
e-commerce.
Out of college, Marsha worked in fashion advertising for the Miami Herald
and then as special projects manager for the Los Angeles Daily News. She also
founded a home-based advertising and marketing business. Her successful
business, the Collier Company, Inc., was featured by Entrepreneur magazine in
1986, and in 1990, Marsha’s company received the Small Business of the Year
award from her California State Assemblyman and the Northridge Chamber of
Commerce.
Bargains drew Marsha to eBay in 1996, but profitable sales keep her busy 
on the site now. Marsha applies her business acumen to eBay, and in this
book, she shares that knowledge with you. In eBay Business All-in-One Desk
Reference For Dummies, Marsha combines her knowledge of business, mar-
keting, and eBay savvy to help you make a smooth and quick transition from
part-time seller to full-time moneymaker.


Dedication
I dedicate this book to budding eBay entrepreneurs. This book will help you
through the tough spots and, I hope, to a hugely successful eBay business.
Author’s Acknowledgments
My career on eBay is totally due to the kindness of others. I have met many
fine people on eBay and I’d love to acknowledge them all (but my publisher
won’t let me have the space). 
I’d like to thank the eBay education group: Susan Philips, Sharon Guldner,
Mike Rudolf, and  Tom Cotton. My goal is your goal; we’re in this education
thing together.
Thanks also to Marc Cohen and Mark Oleesky from the KABC Computer &
Technology Show for letting me stand in for a missing host every now and
then. I’ve learned a lot from you guys and it’s about time I thanked you 
publicly!
And thanks to the Wiley crew, once again: Andy Cummings, for the access;
Steven Hayes, for your creativity and humanity in a dog-eat-dog publishing
business, and Susan Pink, for your continued work on my books — I’ll bet
this will be the last one for a while!
Patti Louise Ruby, my technical editor, is also my good friend. Thank you for
your fine work on this challenging project.

Introduction
I
am lucky enough to have been selling on eBay since 1996 and am a char-
ter member of the PowerSeller program. Running a business on eBay has
given me the opportunity to spend more time with my loved ones and have
better control of my life. I can make my own schedule and enjoy what I’m
doing because my business is making a profit. Owning an online business
can be empowering.
Those of us who run an eBay business always seem to be doing something.
Buying, selling, even going on a vacation, our business keeps humming.
There’s no 9 to 5, no weekends or holidays. Our stores on eBay are always
open for business: making sales and making us money.
Alas, all that success and freedom take some work. That’s why you have
this book.
About the Book
This book will give you the basics, the hows and whys of setting up a 
home-based business on eBay. I’ve authored several best-selling books
about running a business on eBay. This book gives you the information
you need to get started in one nifty (albeit heavy) volume.
What You’re Not to Read
There’s little in this book that you won’t find useful. Some of it may be 
too basic if you’re a more advanced seller, so just skip right on by that 
information. 
Sidebars are scattered through the book with additional information on a
subject. If you want to know the subject in depth, read the sidebar. If it’s not
important to you, blow right past it.
There’s no need to start at the beginning. Check out the table of contents
and see whether something piques your interest. Have a question about
eBay? Look it up in the index. This book is meant to be your useful desk ref-
erence on eBay.

Foolish Assumptions
2
Foolish Assumptions
While writing this book, I’ve made a few assumptions about you. Because
you bought this book, I assume that you’re an intelligent person with refined
tastes. Okay, that may be true, but the main assumption I’ve really made
about you is that you want to find out more about eBay. 
I assume also that you
✦Have a computer and an Internet connection
✦Are comfortable browsing the Internet
✦Are familiar with e-mail
✦Are looking for a way to make some extra money
✦Have checked out eBay and perhaps bought a few items
Perhaps you think that eBay just might be a good place to earn a regular
stream of extra income. If you can accept that nothing comes without a bit
of effort, you might just be on the track of a new career.
How This Book Is Organized
Here, in one volume, are nine individual books related to becoming an expert
on eBay. Each book is broken down into individual chapters to give you more
in-depth information on the subject at hand. Here’s the lineup.
Book I: eBay Basics
Book I provides the beginning stuff you have to know to make your way on
eBay. Sure, you can do business on eBay and not know all the small details,
but this book has the information that will give you the winning edge over
other sellers. Even if you’ve been on eBay for a while, you might just dis-
cover a few things reading this book.
Book II: Essential Tools
Using eBay means using some of the basic tools that eBay has developed for
buyers and sellers. In Book II, you research prices (for buying or selling), find
an item (no matter how badly the seller mislisted it), and use PayPal with
ease. You also find out how an Internet search can help you with your eBay
business.

Also, there’s a chapter on effective eBay communications. Sounds a bit stuffy,
I know, but your e-mail communications are the cornerstone of your eBay
business
Book III: Selling Like a Pro
Anyone can list an item for sale on eBay, but after you read the information
in Book III, you’ll be among the elite who can squeeze extra profits from your
sales. You also find out how to use advanced eBay tools that can cut your
work time to a fraction of what other sellers spend. 
Book IV: Sourcing Merchandise
The number one question that people ask me is “What should I sell on
eBay?” To me, it’s intuitive — but then again, I love to shop. Book IV gives
you the tools for finding the right items to please your customers and make
regular sales. The information in this book is not just someone’s theory.
Instead, it comes directly from professional retailers, people who are suc-
cesses on eBay!
Book V: Presenting Your Items 
All the salesmanship in the world won’t sell your items if your pictures 
are fuzzy and your auctions look amateurish. Book V teaches you just a 
bit of HTML, so that your auctions will have some extra pizzazz. You also
uncover the photography secrets of eBay pros.
Book VI: Promoting Your Goods
After you have some items selling well on eBay, it’s time to expand your hori-
zons. Find out how to use marketing tools to let the world know about your
eBay sales and store. Start a Web site! A Web site can be a small investment
that can up your monthly profits without increasing your workload. The
Internet is open to the world — use it to bring more customers to your door.
Book VII: Storing and Shipping
Yawn. Storing and shipping may not be the sexiest topics in the world, but
they are two places where many eBay businesses fall down. In Book VII, see
how some of eBay’s biggest PowerSellers organize their merchandise. Find
out how you can turn your shipping area from a headache to a profit center.
That turns shipping into a sexy topic, doesn’t it?
Book VIII: Power Selling
Step up your sales to the next level. Become a PowerSeller, open an eBay
store. Book VIII shows you how to grab information from your sales statis-
tics and ramp up your profits.

Icons Used in This Book

Book IX: Office and Legal
The American dream (success) comes with some responsibilities (bookkeep-
ing, licenses, taxes). And the more successful you become, the more you need
to follow the rules. Read Book IX to understand the rules for your business
in your own state. Successful is as successful does. 
Icons Used in This Book
I’ve written quite a few books in the For Dummies series, and they all have
cute little icons to draw your attention to special comments. Following are
the ones I use and what they mean.
This icon indicates a story about a real event. It may have been one of my
auctions or one from a fellow user. I hope you find the story interesting and
learn from another user’s mistake (or dumb luck).
When you see this icon, it’s a friendly reminder to keep in mind the short
fact that follows. No doubt it will come up again, and you’ll be ahead of the
game if you remember it.
Here are a few words from me to you, to help you do things the easy way.
I’ve made the mistakes, but you don’t have to make them too.
This little bomb of a fact will keep you out of trouble. Often these facts are
not generally known. Be sure to read them to avoid common pitfalls.
Where to Go from Here
It’s time to open the book and dive in. Be sure to also visit my Web site,
www.coolebaytools.com, for updates on this book. You’ll also find articles
about things going on at eBay and a place to sign up for my free newsletter. I
send out the newsletter as often as I can, sharing new and interesting tidbits
of information with my readers. Your e-mail address is safe with me because
I promise to never share it.
You can also e-mail me from the feedback link on my Web site. I read all my
e-mails, and try to answer as many as I can. But please remember that I’m
just me. No giant staff, no big offices. I write books, research new products
to help eBay sellers, teach for eBay University, run an eBay business, and
try to have a home life. 
Thank you for buying this book. Please e-mail me and let me know about
your eBay successes.

f the whole idea of technology gives you the willies, don’t back out now. 
I feel your pain. Every tech-oriented bit of knowledge that’s entered my
pea-sized brain has penetrated only after a great deal of mental whining. 
I suffered the pain so that you wouldn’t have to.
Better yet, you don’t need to know much technology (in the true sense of
the word) to run a successful online business. Most online sellers have no
more knowledge than you will after you read this chapter.
Starting with the Right Computer
You don’t have to know a lot of fancy computer mumbo-jumbo to do well on
eBay, but you must have a computer. If you’re in the market for a computer,
you can buy or lease a new, used, or refurbished system, depending on your
computing needs.
The absolute necessities
Although the following list is geared mainly toward the purchase of new
PCs, which you can get for considerably under a thousand bucks, you
should read this info even if you’re thinking of buying a used computer:
✦Look for a computer with a good memory. Remember that 1950s
horror movie, The Blob? The more time you spend using your computer,
the more stuff you want to save on your hard drive. The more stuffed
your hard drive, the more Blob-like it becomes. A hard drive with at

least 40 gigabytes (GB) of storage space should keep your computer
happy, but you can get hard drives as big as 200GB. I recommend you
buy the biggest hard drive you can afford because no matter how large
your hard drive is, you’ll find a way to fill it up.
✦Make sure you have a top-quality modem if you have a dial-up connec-
tion. Your modem connects your computer to the Internet using your
telephone line. Even if you have a broadband connection (see later in
this chapter), you should have a modem that can connect you on the off-
chance that your high-speed service is down. (A modem transfers data
over phone lines at a rate called kilobytes per second, or just plain K). 
A 56K modem is standard equipment these days, especially if you plan
on using a lot of digital images (photographs) to help sell your items.
✦Get a big screen. A monitor that has at least a 15-inch screen can make
a huge difference after several hours of rabid bidding or proofreading
your auction item descriptions. Anything smaller and you’ll have a hard
time actually seeing the auctions and images. Also, opt for an LCD moni-
tor if your budget can stand it. They take up tons less room on your desk
and make you feel kinda space age.
✦Make sure the computer’s central processing unit (CPU) is fast. A CPU
is your computer’s brain. It should be the fastest you can afford. You can
always opt for the top-of-the-line, but even a slower 900 MHz (megahertz)
processor could suffice. One of my computers is an antique slowpoke,
but it’s still fast enough that it won’t choke when I ask it to do some minor
multitasking. If you want lightning-fast speed (imagine a Daytona 500
race car with jet assist), you have to move up to the 3 GHz (gigahertz)
hyperthreading Pentium 4.
✦Get a CD-R drive. A CD burner is standard equipment. You use the 
CD drive to load new software programs into your computer from com-
pact discs. You can also use the CDs for your system backups. Top-end
models even play DVD movies on your computer, but I think you’ll be 
so entertained by eBay that you can skip the frills and save the bucks.
✦You must have a keyboard. No keyboard, no typing. The basic key-
board is fine. They do make funky ergonomic models that are split in 
the middle. But if the good old standard keyboard feels comfortable 
to you, stick with it.
✦You need a pointing device, usually a mouse. Some laptops come with
touchpads or trackballs designed to do the same thing — give you a
quick way to move the pointer around the screen so that you can select
options by clicking.
Buying a used computer
If you don’t have a computer yet and don’t have much money to spend, you
might want to investigate the used market. Thousands of perfectly good

9
used machines are floating around looking for a caring home. You can pick
up a Pentium III for a few hundred dollars, and it will serve your budding
eBay needs just fine. The same holds true for used Macs. Make sure a moni-
tor is included in the purchase price.
Buying a refurbished computer
If you don’t feel comfortable buying a used machine, you may want to con-
sider a factory-refurbished model. These are new machines that were
returned to the manufacturer for one reason or another. The factory fixes
them so they’re nice and spiffy, and then sweetens the deal with a terrific
warranty. Some companies even offer optional, extended, on-site repairs.
What you’re getting is a new computer at a deep discount because the
machine can’t be resold legally as new.
For the most part, refurbished computers are defined as returns, units with
blemishes (scratches, dents, and so on), or evaluation units. The factories
rebuild them to the original working condition, using new parts (or some-
times used parts that meet or exceed performance specs for new parts).
They come with 60- to 90-day warranties that cover repairs and returns.
Warranty information is available on the manufacturers’ Web sites. Be sure
to read it before you purchase a refurbished computer.
Major computer manufacturers such as Dell, IBM, Sony, Hewlett-Packard,
and Apple provide refurbished computers. Check whether their Web site 
has an outlet store. (Their outlet stores may reside in eBay Stores.) I visit
shopping.hp.com and check the HP/Compaq outlet for closeouts and refur-
bished goods all the time — and I’ve never been burned!
Because the inventory of refurbished computers changes daily (as do the
prices), there’s no way of telling exactly how much money you can save by
buying refurbished instead of new. I suggest that you find a new computer
system you like (and can afford) in a store or a catalog, and then compare
it with refurbished systems. If you’re thinking about buying from the Web
or a catalog, don’t forget to include the cost of shipping in the total price.
Even with shipping costs, however, a refurbished computer may save you
between 30% and 60%, depending on the deal you find.
Upgrading your system with the help of eBay
You may think I’m putting the cart before the horse with this suggestion, but
you can get a new or used computer system at a great price by signing on 
to eBay before you buy your computer. You can get online at a local library
or ask to borrow a friend’s computer. I’ve seen eBay listings for Pentium 3
machines, fully outfitted, for $400. Often such systems also come fully

Connecting to eBay without a Computer

loaded with software. And when you have your new system in shape, why
not auction off your old system on eBay?
You can also find on eBay all the bits and pieces you need to upgrade your
computer. The items you may find most useful include
✦Digital cameras and scanners
✦Disk drives, including CD-ROM drives and memory cards
✦Modems
✦Monitors
✦Printers
If you have a good used computer without a modem, you can upgrade to a
pretty fast 56K model for about $20 by watching eBay auctions carefully.
If you plan on using a lot of digital images (photographs) to help sell your
items, you’re going to need that 56K modem. Considering the reasonable
price, it certainly makes sense to buy the fastest modem you can afford.
(Of course, then you’d have to have a modem so you could connect and
buy another modem. . . .)
You may have to keep checking in and monitoring the different auctions that
eBay has going on; listings change daily. Go put in your best bid, and check
back later to see whether you’ve won! (If you want to find out about the fine
art of sniping — bidding at the last minute — skip to Chapter 6. I won’t be
insulted if you leave me for awhile now. Honest.)
Connecting to eBay without a Computer
Yes, sometimes life is a Catch-22 situation. Say your goal is to make some
money on eBay so that you can afford to buy a computer. Because you can’t
log on to eBay without a computer, you can’t make money, right? Well, not
exactly. Here’s how you can start selling and bringing in some cold hard cash
for that shiny new (or not-so-shiny used) hardware.
Libraries: From Dewey Decimal to eBay
If you haven’t been to your local library lately, you may be surprised that most
libraries are fully wired with computers that connect to the Internet. The card
catalog has been replaced by computers that keep the Dewey Decimal System
(DDS) alive and connected to libraries all over the world. For example, you’ll
find this book classified in 381.17, with the subject heading “Auctions — 
computer network resources.” Some libraries don’t even require you to have

Chapter 1

11
a library card if you want to use a computer. Others limit the amount of time
you can spend online and the sites you can log on to (often only adult sites
are blocked). eBay is considered fair game, and exploring it is even considered
research.
The upside of using the library’s computer is that it’s free. The downside is
that you may have to wait for some kid to finish doing research for a term
paper on the ceremonial use of yak milk.
Commercial cyber-outlets
If you strike out at the public library (or you’re tired of the librarian shushing
you as you cheer your winning bids), your friend throws you out of the
house, and your boss watches you like a hawk, you can use a commercial
outlet to kick off your eBay career. National chains such as FedEx Kinko’s or
your favorite local cybercafé offer computer usage at an hourly rate. FedEx
Kinko’s offers computers (both PCs and Macs loaded with all the software
you need) that can get you online for around $12 per hour or $.20 per minute.
No restrictions apply: You get full access to the Internet and can enjoy all 
the elements of eBay. You can conduct your auctions by posting them and
checking back regularly. You can also watch for great computer deals that
you may want to bid on.
Cybercafés can be another way to go. If you live near a college, you’ll proba-
bly find some. Hourly rates are much cheaper because you end up ordering
a cup of joe or a soda. I once checked on my auctions from a cybercafé in
Peru; they charged only $1.50 an hour — what a deal!
Hooking up from work
If you get a long lunch at work or have to kill time waiting for clients to call
back, you may want to get started on eBay from your work computer. But
give it a lot of thought before you do. Pink slips can come unbidden to those
who run auctions on company time.
Choosing an ISP
Okay, so you bought (or found a way to access) a computer, and you’re
ready to surf eBay. Hold on a minute — before you start surfing, you need
access to the Internet. (Details, details. . . .) The way to access the Internet 
is through an ISP, or Internet service provider, such as America Online (AOL),
Earthlink, MSN (Microsoft Network), or RoadRunner. If you don’t already
belong to one of these, don’t worry; joining is easy.

Choosing an ISP
12
To join a telephone dial-up ISP, just load the freebie registration disc that
comes with a computer (or free at the computer store) into your CD-ROM
drive and follow the registration steps that appear on your computer screen.
Have your credit card and lots of patience handy. With a little luck and no
computer glitches, you’ll have an active account and instant access to e-mail
and the Internet in less than an hour.
When you go to a computer store or buy a computer, you’re hit with all kinds
of free trial offers that beg you to “Sign up now, get 30 hours free!” You can
find free introductory CDs everywhere! I have a friend who painted all her
free CD-ROMs and hung them on her Christmas tree. Another sawed them in
half and made a very unattractive cyberbelt. If you’re new to the Internet and
not sure which ISP to go with, your best bet may be to start with America
Online. AOL is the largest ISP around, and it’s easy to find and easy to use.
If you’re not happy with AOL down the road, you can easily cancel your
membership and sign up with a different company.
If you have a need for speed, and your time is worth a bit more than an
increase in ISP cost, you may want to look into getting a broadband connec-
tion. The quality of the different types of broadband (DSL and cable) can
vary greatly from area to area and even from street to street.
Before you decide what kind of broadband connection you want, go to the
following:
www.broadbandreports.com
Type your zip code, and read the reports for other users in your area (see
Figure 1-1). You can e-mail, post questions, and get all the information you
need to decide what kind of high-speed connection will work best for you.
Broadband, or high-speed, connections can be a boon to your eBay busi-
ness. Here’s the skinny on the different types:
✦DSL: Short for Digital Subscriber Line. For as little as $39.95 a month, 
you can get rid of your pokey, analog dial-up connection and always be
connected to the Internet. A DSL line can move data as fast as 6MB per
second — that’s six million bits per second, or 140 times as fast as a 56K
modem. At that speed, a DSL connection can greatly enhance your eBay
and Internet experiences. For more information about what DSL is and
how to get it, visit www.dsllife.com.
✦Cable: An Internet cable connection is a reliable method for Internet access
if you have cable TV. Your Internet connection runs through your televi-
sion cable and is regulated by your cable TV provider. With the advent of
digital cable, this reliable and speedy Internet connection is an excellent
alternative. (See my speed report in Figure 1-2.) Most cable accounts
include several e-mail addresses and space to store your images.

Accessing E-Mail
After you have access to the Internet, you need access to e-mail. If you have
your own computer and an ISP, you probably have e-mail access automati-
cally. But if you’re logging on to the Internet away from home, you might
want to look into setting up a free e-mail provider.

Most ISPs will allow you to check your e-mail from their Web sites, but com-
monly, you’ll be using Microsoft’s Outlook Express to check your mail on
your home computer.
Yahoo! and Hotmail are two of the most popular e-mail providers. Both are
free and secure, and signing up is a snap. I like them both because they have
a Mail Alert feature, which allows you to instruct Yahoo! or MSN Mobile to
contact you through your pager (or Web-enabled cell phone) when you have
new e-mail. You can join Yahoo! e-mail at www.yahoo.com. You can join
Hotmail by going to www.hotmail.com.
Some commonsense rules can help you protect your account:
✦Select a password that’s difficult to guess. Use letter-and-number 
combinations or nonsensical words that nobody else knows. Don’t
use common names or words relating to you (such as the name of
your street).
✦Keep passwords secret. If someone asks for your password online, you
can bet it’s a scam. Never give out your password.
✦Don’t open an e-mail with an attachment from an unknown person.
The attachment (another file attached to your e-mail message) could
contain a virus.
✦Don’t respond to spam e-mail. Spam is online slang for harassing, offen-
sive, or useless-but-widely-distributed messages or advertisements. If
you ignore such junk, the sender will probably just give up and go away.
Browsing for a Browser
When you get a computer, you get an Internet browser for free. A browser is
the software program that lets your computer talk to the Internet. It’s like
having your own private cyberchauffeur. Type the address (also known as
the URL, for Uniform Resource Locator) of the Web site you want to visit, and
boom, you’re there. For example, to get to eBay’s home page, type www.
ebay.com and press Enter. (It’s sort of a low-tech version of “Beam me up,
Scotty!” — and almost as fast.)
The two most popular browsers are Netscape Navigator and Microsoft
Internet Explorer. (They are what Coca-Cola and Pepsi are to the cola wars.)
Both programs are powerful and user-friendly. Figures 1-3 and 1-4 show you
these browsers. (Sit, browser! Now shake! Good browser!)

Perusing the menus
At the top of almost all Microsoft-enabled programs are standard drop-down
lists that invoke various programs. Who’d ever think you’d need to use
menus, given all the colorful icons that Internet Explorer provides? Well,
the drop-down lists give you more in-depth access to the program’s capabili-
ties. Table 1-1 is an overview of the various tasks you can perform from the

A
s I’ve said before, the writer Thomas Wolfe was wrong: You can go
home again — and again. At least with eBay you can! Day after day mil-
lions of people land at eBay’s home page without wearing out the welcome
mat. The eBay home page is the front door to the most popular e-tailing site
on the Internet.
Everything you need to know about navigating eBay begins right here. In
this chapter, I give you the grand tour of the areas you can reach right from
the home page with the help of links.
Homing In on the Home Page
The eBay home page is shown in Figure 2-1. It includes several key areas:
✦A navigation bar at the top of the page with five eBay links that can zip
you straight to any of the many eBay areas and four additional — and
powerful — links right above the navigation bar
✦Links to eBay’s specialty sites
✦A list of links to auction categories
✦Links to Business Marketplace, featured auctions, fun stuff such as char-
ity and live auctions, and the 23 international eBay sites
In the upper-right corner of every eBay page is a search box that helps you
find items by title keywords

Homing In on the Home Page
20
Do not adjust your computer monitor. You’re not going crazy. You may
notice that a link was on the eBay home page one day but gone the next day.
The links on the eBay home page change to reflect what’s going on — not
just on the site but also in the world. Figure 2-2 gives you a look at the alter-
nate eBay home page, which is only shown to new, unregistered visitors
when they arrive at the site.
Home page links, the next generation
If you look carefully on the home page, you can see several other links that
give you express service to several key parts of the site. Here are the 
highlights:
✦Specialty sites: Here’s where clicking a link gets you to eBay’s specialty
sites. A click on the eBay Motors link brings you to ebaymotors.com, an
area dedicated to the sale of almost everything with a motor and wheels.
The eBay Stores link (stores.ebay.com) takes you to a separate area of
eBay loaded with thousands of stores run by eBay sellers. eBay stores
are filled with items you can purchase without bidding. Visit half.com by
eBay — a virtual marketplace for books, music, video, and electronics.
There’s also a link to eBay’s PayPal online payment service.

✦Featured items: Visit the featured items links in the center of the page.
Here at eBay, money talks pretty loudly, so a seller can pay extra to feature
his or her auction and maybe it will land on the home page sometime
during its run. eBay rotates six featured items throughout the day so
that as many sellers as possible get a shot at being in the spotlight.
When you click the featured auction’s All Featured Items link, you’re
instantly beamed to eBay’s Home Page Featured Items section.
You can find everything from Las Vegas vacations to Model-T Fords to diet
products in the Home Page Featured Items section. Home Page Featured
Items are not for mere mortals with small wallets. They’ve been lifted to
the exalted featured status because sellers shelled out lots of money to
get them noticed. All you need to get your auction featured is $39.95
($79.95 for Multiple Item listings), plus a second or two to click Home
Page Featured Item on the Sell Your Item form.
Note that bidding on these items works the same way as bidding on reg-
ular items.
✦Business marketplace: This link takes you to a themed area geared to
business-to-business transactions. In this area you’ll find categories that
will aid you in outfitting any kind of business — and I mean any. From
construction backhoes to restaurant equipment, it’s here.

✦eBay Pulse: Here you’ll find a daily snapshot of the heart of eBay.
There’s a list of the top ten most popular searches on the site, a list of
the largest eBay stores, the top most-watched auctions, and lots more
interesting info.
✦Giving Works (Charity): This link takes you to the hub page for the
many charity auctions that benefit worthwhile organizations. Charity
auctions are a great way for memorabilia collectors to find one-of-a-kind
(and authentic) items. Winning bids contribute to programs that help
charities. If you’re involved in a nonprofit and are interested in running
a charity auction on eBay, check out Chapter 4.
✦Live auctions: This link takes you to incredibly fun live auctions, where
you can place bids in real time against other bidders. Chapter 4 is the
place to go for more info on live auctions.
✦Wholesale: This link takes you to the Wholesale Lots hub page, which is
loaded with links to the wholesale lot areas in eBay categories. Check it
out in Figure 2-3.
✦Global sites: This links you to eBay’s international auction sites. You 
may enter eBay Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada,
China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Korea, Mexico,
Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
Taiwan, and (whew) the United Kingdom. The international sites are in
the country’s native language. It might be a good place to practice your
third-year French — or maybe not! Remember that after you leave eBay
USA, you’re subject to the contractual and privacy laws of the country
you’re visiting.
eBay’s Center Square: The promotion du jour
The eBay community is constantly changing. To
help you get into the swing of things right away,
eBay provides a couple of special boxes, smack
dab in the middle of the home page, packed with
links that take you to the latest eBay special
events.
Even if the main promotion box doesn’t appeal
to you, usually you can find some interesting
links dotted around the home page without a
headline. Also take a look at the small promo-
tion boxes below the featured items.
You can get there from here — lots of places,
in fact:
 A rotating list of special-interest links
changes at least once a day. (Half the fun
is getting a closer look at pages you haven’t
seen.)
 Special money-saving offers from third-
party vendors can be a boon if you’re on
the lookout for a bargain.

You may notice that the graphic links on the home page change from day to
day — and even hour to hour. If you’re interested in the featured areas of the
site, visit this page several times a day to see the entire array of special hap-
penings on eBay.
Bottoming out
At the very bottom of the home page is an unassuming group of links provid-
ing more ways to get to some seriously handy pages:
✦Feedback Forum: This link takes you to one of the most important spots
on eBay. The Feedback Forum is where you can place feedback, respond
to feedback left for you, and find out whether you’ve forgotten to place
feedback on a transaction — all in one friendly location.
✦Anything Points: eBay’s answer to Green Stamps. You can earn Anything
Points from sellers who give them with purchases, or by availing your-
self of many eBay offers.
✦Downloads: A link to eBay supplied software and toolbars. See Book II
for more on these super tools.
✦Gift certificates: Send an eBay gift certificate for any special occasion.
You can print it yourself, or eBay will send it to any e-mail address you
provide. The gift certificate is good for any item on the site, as long as
the seller accepts PayPal.

✦PayPal: This link takes you to the home page of PayPal, the eBay online
payment service.
✦Jobs: Click here if you want to work for eBay instead of through eBay.
✦Affiliates: If you have your own Web site and want to make a few bucks,
click this link. If you sign up for the program and put a link to eBay on
your Web page, eBay pays you $5 for any new user that signs up directly
from your Web site (plus other bonuses).
✦Developers: If you develop software and would like to design some to
use with eBay, you can join the developers network. First, check out
John Kaufeld’s new book, Developing eBay Business Tools For Dummies.
✦The eBay Shop: This link enables you to browse and buy eBay merchan-
dise from the eBay company store.
✦About eBay: Click this link to find out about eBay the company and to
get its press releases, company overview, and stock information. You
can also find out about eBay community activities and charities — and
even apply for a job with eBay.
✦Announcements: Visit the General Announcements Board when you
want to know about any late-breaking news.
✦Security Center: This link takes you to a page where concerns about
fraud and safety are addressed. Before buying or selling, it’s a good idea
to check out the Security Center in Chapter 3.
✦Policies: This is a good place to visit to brush up on the site’s policies
and guidelines.
✦Site map: Here’s a second link to the eBay site map (the other link is
above the navigation bar).
✦Help: For some reason, eBay felt the need to put another help link at the
bottom of the home page. Save yourself some scrolling and use the link
on the navigation bar!
On other eBay pages, the bottom navigation bar looks a little different. It often
includes even more links so that you can cruise the site quickly without using
the navigation bar.
Navigating eBay the Easy Way
The navigation bar is at the top of the eBay home page and lists five eBay
links that take you directly to different eBay areas. Using the navigation bar
is kind of like doing one-stop clicking. You can find this bar at the top of
every page on eBay. Clicking some of the links reveals a subnavigation bar
with links to other, related important places.

Think of links as expressways to specific destinations. Click a link and, the
next thing you know, you’re right where you want to be. You don’t even have
to answer that annoying old question, “When are we gonna get there?” from
the kids in the backseat.
Here, without further ado, are the five navigation bar links and where they
take you:
✦Buy: Takes you to the page that lists the top-level eBay categories and
provides many buying-related links, links to the home page’s Featured
Items (see Book III), and a Search window, as shown in Figure 2-4. You’ll
find a mini version of your My eBay page here with drop-down links for
your favorite searches, sellers, and categories. From this page, you have
many ways of finding any one of the millions of items for sale on eBay.
You’ll find top-level categories on the Buy page. When you click to browse
a category (for example, Books), you’ll be brought to a category hub
page that lists the subcategories of that category. Click your desired
subcategory, and you arrive at the subcategory page, where you see
three yellow tabs at the top of the listings. These tabs offer you different
viewing options to browse:
• All Items is the default setting for the page. This option delivers on
its promise — you see all items, including auctions and those items
that can be purchased immediately using Buy It Now.

• Click the Auctions tab to see only the items that are up for auction.
• The Buy It Now tab isolates a view of all items listed with the Buy It
Now feature.
Also, just below the tabs and above the listings is a Sort By drop-down
box (see Figure 2-5) that allows you to sort your category results. You
can sort in these ways:
• Time: ending soonest allows you to view the category listings in
time order, with the soonest to end on top. (This is the way I always
sort when I’m browsing.)
• Time: newly listed shows the items that have recently been listed in
the category.
• Time: ending today displays items that end in the next 24 hours and
are displayed with the item ending soonest listed  first.
• Time: new today is where you can get the jump on other bargain
hunters and see the full listing of items launched within the past
24 hours.
• Price: lowest first sorting can be deceiving. Many sellers list their
items at an extremely low starting price to attract bidders. You may
have to wade through twenty pages of ninety-nine cent items before
you reach the dollar ones — a huge waste of time.
• Price: highest first is a good choice if you’re looking for high-ticket
items in a category.

• Payment: PayPal first orders the items first by sellers who accept
PayPal, starting with those listings ending soonest.
• Payment: PayPal last shows you items sorted first by sellers who
don’t accept PayPal, starting with those listings ending soonest.
You can also search through the category. Type some keywords in the
search box to find, for example, a particular book. Because more than 
10 million items are up for auction at any given time, finding just one
(say, a book on antique Vermont milk cans) is no easy task.
✦Sell: Takes you to the first stop of the Sell Your Item form that you fill
out to start your listings. (More on how to sell in Book III.) You also see 
a bunch of links that can take you to a zillion different places on eBay.
Stop by someday when you have a lot of time on your hands.
✦My eBay: Takes you to your personal My eBay page, where you keep
track of your buying and selling activities, account information, and
favorite categories (more about My eBay in Chapter 3).
✦Community: Takes you to a page where you can find the latest news and
announcements, chat with fellow traders in the eBay community, find
charity auctions, and discover more about eBay. Several boxes in the
subnavigation bar correspond to the links on the page (more on the
eBay community in Chapter 8).
✦Help: Opens the eBay Help Center overview page, which consists of a
search box in which you can type your query and links for help topics.
Above and below the eBay navigation bar are five small (but mighty) links
that are just as important as the links on the navigation bar:
✦Home: Takes you right back to the home page. Use this link from any
other page when you need to get back to the home page right away.
✦Pay: When you click Pay, you go to a page that shows the last few items
you’ve won and haven’t paid for. There’s also a handy link to PayPal so
that you can pay for your entire shopping spree at once!
✦Services: Takes you to the eBay Services overview page. Here, you can
find links that connect you to the various buying and selling services, as
well as eBay general services.
✦Site map: Provides you with a bird’s-eye view of the eBay world. Every
top-level (or main) link available on eBay is listed here. If you’re ever
confused about finding a specific area, try the site map first. If a top-level
link isn’t listed here, it’s not on eBay — yet.
✦Sign In/Sign Out: This link, which is below the navigation bar, toggles
between Sign In and Sign Out depending on your sign-in status. This is
an important link, and I remind you about it throughout the book. When
you’re signed in, it reads Hello, followed by your user ID.

Maneuvering the Categories

Maneuvering the Categories
So how does eBay keep track of the millions of items up for auction at any
given moment? The brilliant minds at eBay decided to group items into nice,
neat little storage systems called categories. The home page lists most of the
main categories, but eBay also lists tens of thousands of subcategories, rang-
ing from Antiques to Weird Stuff. And don’t ask how many sub-subcategories
(categories within categories) eBay has — I can’t count that high.
Well, okay, I could list all the categories and subcategories currently available
on eBay — if you wouldn’t mind squinting at a dozen pages of really small,
eye-burning text. But a category browse is an adventure that’s unique for
each individual, and I wouldn’t think of depriving you of it. Suffice it to say
that if you like to hunt around for that perfect something, you’re in browsing
heaven now.
Here’s how to navigate around the categories:
1. Click the category that interests you, such as Books or DVDs &
Movies.
You’re transported to that category’s page. You see categories and sub-
categories listed next to each heading. Happy hunting.
If you don’t find a category that interests you among those on the home
page, simply click the Buy button on the navigation bar, and you’re off to
the main categories page. You get not only a pretty impressive page of
main categories and subcategories, but also a short list of featured auc-
tions and a link to them all.
If you really and truly want to see a list of all categories and subcategories
(see Figure 2-6), click See All Categories at the bottom of the category
list on the main Buy page. Or, if you want to make it easy on yourself, go
directly to the following:
listings.ebay.com/pool1/listings/list/overview.html
2. After the category page appears, find a subcategory below the main
category title that interests you. Click the subcategory, and keep dig-
ging through the sub-subcategories until you find what you want.
For example, if you’re looking for items honoring your favorite television
show, click the Entertainment Memorabilia category or the DVDs &
Movies category. Note that the Entertainment Memorabilia category
has many links, including the Television Memorabilia subcategory. Below
the Television Memorabilia link, you’ll see links to these subcategories:
Ads, Flyers, Apparel, Clippings, Photos, Pins, Buttons, Posters, Press
Kits, Props, Scripts, Wardrobe, and Other. Click the link that appeals to
you and you’re off on a shopping spree.

Book I
Chapter 2

3. When you find an item that interests you, click the item and the full
auction page pops up on your screen.
Congratulations — you’ve just navigated through several million items
to find that one TV-collectible item that caught your attention. (Pardon
me while I bid on that Lily Munster — Yvonne DeCarlo signed picture.)
You can instantly return to the home page by clicking its link at the top
of the page (or return to the listings page by repeatedly clicking the Back
button at the top of your browser).
Near the bottom of every subcategory or search results page, you can see a
list of numbers. The numbers are page numbers, and you can use them to
fast-forward through all the items in that subcategory. So, if you feel like
browsing around page 8 without going through 8 pages individually, just
click number 8; you’re presented with the items on that page (their listings,
actually). Happy browsing.
If you’re a bargain hunter by habit, you may find some pretty weird stuff
while browsing the categories and subcategories of items at eBay — some 
of it supercheap and some of it just cheap. There’s even a Weird Stuff 
category — no kidding! Remember that (as with any marketplace) you’re
responsible for finding out as much as possible about an item before you
buy — and definitely before you bid. So, if you’re the type who sometimes
can’t resist a good deal, ask yourself what you plan to do with the pile of stuff
you can get for 15 cents — and ask yourself now, before it arrives on your
doorstep. Chapter 6 offers more information on savvy bidding techniques.

Exploring Home Page Search Options

Exploring Home Page Search Options
There’s an old Chinese expression that says, “Every journey begins with the
first eBay search.” Okay, I updated the quote. Very wise words nonetheless.
You can start a search from the home page in one of two ways:
✦Use the search box. It’s right there at the top of the home page, and it’s
a fast way of finding item listings.
✦Use the Advanced Search link (which is below the search box in the
upper-right corner of the home page). This link will take you to the
sophisticated Search area, where you can do all kinds of specialized
searches.
To launch a title search from the home page, follow these steps:
1. In the search box, type no more than a few keywords that describe
the item you’re looking for.
Refer to Figure 2-1 to see the search box.
2. Click the Search button.
The results of your search appear in a matter of seconds.
You can type just about anything in the search box and get some informa-
tion. Say you’re looking for Star Trek memorabilia. If so, you’re not alone.
The television show premiered on September 8, 1966, and even though it
was canceled in 1969 because of low ratings, Star Trek has become one of the
most successful science-fiction franchises in history. You can use the search
box on the eBay home page to find all sorts of Star Trek stuff. I just ran a
search and found around 35,000 items in 1,454 categories on eBay with Star
Trek in their titles.
Try the Advanced Search link under the search box to narrow down your
search. This link takes you to the basic search page, which is explained in
Book II, Chapter 1.
When you search for popular items at eBay (a classic example is Star Trek
memorabilia), you may get inundated with thousands of auctions that match
your search criteria. Even if you’re traveling at warp speed, you could spend
hours checking each auction individually. (“Scotty, we need more power now!”)
If you’re pressed for time like the rest of us, eBay has not-so-mysterious ways
for you to narrow down your search so that finding a specific item is much
more manageable. Turn to Chapter 4 for insider techniques that can help
you slim down those searches and beef up those results.

T
he prospect of getting started on eBay is exciting — and daunting.
Perhaps you’ve visited the eBay Web site once or twice with the idea
that you might buy something. Maybe you’ve heard your friends talk about
the things they’ve bought. Did you look up something simple, such as a golf
club? Did eBay come up with several thousand listings? Or maybe you fig-
ured you’d get smart and narrow the search down to a 3 iron, but you still
got more than a thousand listings?
Did you consider buying something and then just left the site, for fear you’d
get ripped off? eBay works much better for me than any quasi-convenient 
TV shopping channel because there’s no overly made up huckster telling me
how great I’d look in the outfit on the screen (displayed on a size 4 model). 
On eBay, you have the opportunity to leisurely look an item over, read the
description and terms, and click a link to ask the seller a question before you
bid or buy. eBay’s as simple as that. If you don’t like the seller’s response, you
can just go on to the next seller. That’s the great thing about eBay. There’s
always another seller — and always another item.
Registering on eBay
You can browse eBay all you want without registering, but before you trans-
act any sort of business on eBay, you must register. I recommend registering
while you’re reading this book.
You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to register at eBay. The only hard-
and-fast rule is that you have to be 18 or older. Don’t worry, the Age Police
won’t come to your house to card you; they have other ways to discreetly

Registering on eBay
32
ensure that you’re at least 18 years old. (Hint: Credit cards do more than sat-
isfy account charges.)
If you’re having a momentary brain cramp and you’ve forgotten your age,
just think back to your childhood. If your first memory of Will Smith is as the
Fresh Prince of Bel Air, you’re in. Head to the eBay home page and register.
The entire process takes only a few minutes.
During the early days of online trading, I was selling Star Trek memorabilia
on Auction Web (the initial eBay site) and doing quite well. I ran into William
Shatner (Captain Kirk of Star Trek fame) at a marketing meeting in mid-1997.
Anxious to let him know how well I was doing with my merchandise online, 
I tried to explain Auction Web. Shatner scoffed, “no one will ever make any
money on the Internet.” (Really, I have witnesses — remember this is the
future Mr. Priceline.com.) Ah, well.
Before you can sign up, you have to be connected to the Web, so now’s the
time to fire up your computer. After you open your Internet browser, you’re
ready to sign up. In the address box of your browser, type www.ebay.com
and press Enter.
Your next stop is the eBay home page. Right there, where you can’t miss it, is
the Register Now button. Click this button and let the sign-up process begin.
You can get to the Registration form also by clicking the register link in the
upper part of the navigation bar at the top of the page.
When you’re at the Registration form, you go through a four-step process.
Here’s an overview:
1. Enter the basic required info.
2. Read and accept the User Agreement.
3. Confirm your e-mail address.
4. Breeze through the optional information.
The following sections fill you in on all the details.
You register on eBay through an encrypted (supersecret) connection called
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). You can tell because the normal http at the
beginning of the Web address is now https and a small closed padlock
appears at the bottom-left (or bottom-right) corner of your screen.
The padlock icon means that eBay has moved you to a secure place on their
site that is safe from unauthorized people seeing or receiving your informa-
tion. Your information is treated with the highest security and you can fill

Book I
Chapter 3
Signing Up and
Getting Started
Registering on eBay
33
out these forms with the utmost level of confidence. I could tell you how SSL
works, but instead I’ll just give you the bottom line: It does work, so trust me
and use it. The more precautions eBay (and you) take, the harder it is for
some hyper-caffeinated high-school kid to get into your data.
Filling in required information
After you click the registration button, you’re taken to the first registration
page. At the top of the page, eBay shows the steps of the registration process
and asks you to fill in some required information (see Figure 3-1).
To get started, follow these steps:
1. eBay needs to know stuff about you. Enter the following information:
• Your full name, address, and primary telephone number. eBay keeps
this information on file in case the company (or a member who is a
transaction partner) needs to contact you.
• You can also include, if you want, a secondary phone number and a
fax number.
• Your e-mail address (yourname@myISP.com).
Figure 3-1:
Some of the
required
information
for your
eBay
registration.

If you register with an anonymous e-mail service such as Yahoo! Mail or
Hotmail, you’re taken to a page that requires additional information for
authentication. You must provide valid credit card information for iden-
tification purposes. Your information is protected by eBay’s privacy
policy, and your credit card won’t be charged.
After you input your personal information, you’re ready to create your
eBay persona.
2. Scroll down the page to type your new eBay user ID.
Don’t strain your brain too much right now over your choice of user ID.
You can change your user ID once every 30 days. See “Selecting Your
User ID,” later in this chapter, for some tips on selecting your user ID.
If your chosen ID is taken, eBay has a handy tool to help you select one,
as shown in Figure 3-2.
3. Choose a password, enter it in the Create Password box, and then
type it a second time in the Re-enter Password box to confirm it.
The best passwords for eBay or any Web site are more than six charac-
ters and a combination of letters and numbers. Never use your user ID,
name, pet’s name, address, or anything that may be easily known by
others. C’mon, get a little cagey. For more information on choosing your
password, see “Picking a Pickproof Password,” later in this chapter.
4. Create your secret question and input the answer.
Figure 3-2:

ID widget

Book I
Chapter 3
Signing Up and
Getting Started
Registering on eBay
35
eBay uses the secret question you select here as a security test should you
need help to remember your password. There are six choices. I suggest
you do not select the “What is your mother’s maiden name?” question
because banks and financial institutions often use this question for identi-
fication. Guard your mother’s maiden name and don’t give it out to anyone
blithely. Select one of the other questions and fill in the answer. For more
info on secret questions and their power, visit Book IX, Chapter 4.
5. Type your date of birth.
eBay needs to have your birth date. This is for two reasons. First they
want to be sure that you are of legal age to do business on eBay, and
second, they send you a nice birthday e-mail!
6. Make sure all the info you entered is correct, and then click Continue.
Think back to your second-grade teacher, who kept saying, “Class, check
your work.” Remember that? She’s still right! Review your answers.
If eBay finds a glitch in your registration, such as an incorrect area code
or zip code, you will see a warning message on the next page. This is
part of eBay’s security system to ward off fraudulent registrations.
Use the Back button to correct the information — if you put in a wrong
e-mail address, for example, eBay has no way of contacting you. So you
won’t hear a peep from eBay regarding your registration until you go
through the entire process all over again.
7. Click the Continue button to move on to the next screen.
It’s safe to use your personal e-mail address for eBay registration. You will
not be put on any spurious e-mail lists.
Sellers must register on eBay with a credit or debit card to pay for their eBay
fees. Buyers do not register with a credit or debit card — unless they choose
for their e-mail address one of the anonymous e-mail address services such
as Hotmail or Yahoo! Mail, which do not verify users. Then they must regis-
ter a credit card for identification. The credit card is not charged. If you’d
rather not use a credit card, you may alternatively choose ID Verify. Read
about ID Verify further on.
You must identify yourself to eBay in one of the ways just mentioned before
you get to see the license agreement, which I cover in the next section.
If you change your user ID, an icon of a little blue character changing into a
gold one appears next to your user ID. This icon stays next to your user ID 
for 30 days. Double-check when you see sellers with this icon. They may
have just changed their user ID to mask a bad reputation. They can’t hide
it completely though. You can find the dirt on anyone on eBay by reading
their feedback profile. (For more information on feedback, see Chapter 7.)

Do you solemnly swear?
After you fill in your required information and click Continue, you see the
eBay User Agreement and Privacy Policy. At this page, you take an oath to
keep eBay safe for democracy and commerce. You promise to play well with
others, to not cheat, and to follow the golden rule. No, you’re not auditioning
for a superhero club, but don’t ever forget that eBay takes this stuff seriously.
You can be kicked off eBay or worse. (Can you say “Federal investigation”?)
Be sure to read the User Agreement thoroughly when you register. So that
you don’t have to put down this riveting book to read the legalese right this
minute, I provide the nuts and bolts here:
✦You understand that every transaction is a legally binding contract.
(Click the User Agreement link at the bottom of any eBay page for the
current eBay rules and regulations.)
✦You agree that you can pay for the items you buy and the eBay fees that
you incur.
✦You understand that you’re responsible for paying any taxes.
✦You’re aware that if you sell prohibited items, eBay can forward your
personal information to law enforcement for further investigation.
✦eBay makes clear that it is just a venue, which means it’s a place where
people with similar interests can meet, greet, and do business.
When everything goes well, the eBay Web site is like a school gym that
opens for Saturday swap meets. At the gym, if you don’t play by the rules,
you can get tossed out. But if you don’t play by the rules at eBay, the venue
gets un-gymlike in a hurry. But fair’s fair; eBay keeps you posted by e-mail of
any updates in the User Agreement.
Don’t tell anyone, but your info is safe on eBay
eBay keeps most personal information secret.
The basics (your name, phone number, city, and
state) go out only to answer the specific request
of another registered eBay user (if you are
involved in a transaction with that person), law
enforcement, or members of the eBay Verified
Rights Owner program (eBay’s copyright-
watchdog program). Other users may need your
basic access info for several reasons — a seller
may want to verify your location, get your phone
number to call you regarding your auction, or
double-check who you are. If somebody does
request your info, you get an e-mail from eBay
giving you the name, phone number, city, and
state of the person making the request. You
need to keep the information on your My eBay
page up-to-date. If you don’t, you risk being ban-
ished from the site.

Ps and Qs of the latest policies:

Before you can proceed, you must click the check box, which indicates that
you really, really understand what it means to be an eBay user. Then, because
I know that you, as a law-abiding eBay member, will have no problem follow-
ing the rules, go ahead and click the Continue button at the bottom of the
page, which takes you to a screen stating that eBay is sending you an e-mail.
You’re almost finished.
It must be true if you have it in writing
After you accept the User Agreement, the screen notifies you that an e-mail
has been sent to the e-mail address you supplied during your registration. It
takes eBay less than a minute to e-mail you a confirmation notice. When you
receive the confirmation e-mail, click the Complete eBay Registration link to
continue your registration. If your e-mail doesn’t support links, go to this
address:
pages.eBay.com/register
After you reconnect with eBay and it knows your e-mail address is active,
you’ll be heartily congratulated, as shown in Figure 3-3.
In the unlikely event that you don’t receive your eBay registration confirma-
tion e-mail within 24 hours, your e-mail address most likely contains an
error. At this point, the customer-support folks can help you complete the
registration process. Go to the following address:
http://pages.ebay.com/services/registration/reqtemppass.html

and enter your e-mail address. Click Submit. You will receive another e-mail
with a special one-time confirmation password.
If for some reason (brain cramp is a perfectly acceptable excuse) you incor-
rectly type in the wrong e-mail address, you have to start the registration
process all over again with a different user ID (eBay holds the previous ID
for 30 days). If you run into a snag, you can click the Live Help button that
appears on many pages. See Figure 3-4 for my Live Help discussion.
Your license to deal (almost)
You are now officially a newbie, or eBay rookie. The only problem is that
you’re still at the window-shopping level. If you’re ready to go from window
shopper to item seller, just click the Sell button in the navigation bar. You’ll
have to fill out a few more forms, and before you know it, you can start run-
ning your own auctions at eBay.
Until you’ve been a member of eBay for 30 days, a picture of a beaming,
golden cartoonlike icon is next to your user ID wherever it appears on the
site. This doesn’t mean that you’ve been converted into a golden robot; the
icon merely indicates to other eBay users that you are new to eBay.
Now that you’re a full-fledged, officially registered member of the eBay com-
munity, you may see an eBay pop-up window, giving you the option to provide
more information about yourself. These optional questions allow you to fill
in your self-portrait for your new pals at eBay.
Although eBay doesn’t share member information with anyone, you don’t
have to answer the optional questions if you don’t want to.

The following points show you the optional questions eBay asks. You decide
what you feel comfortable divulging and what you want to keep personal.
eBay asks for this information because the company wants a better picture
of who is using its Web site. In marketing mumbo-jumbo, this stuff is called
demographics — statistics that characterize a group of people who make up
a community. In this case, it’s the eBay community. Here is the optional
information you can provide:
✦Sex: Okay, it really asks you to indicate your gender by selecting a Male/
Female radio button set. (But starting the sentence off with sex really
got your attention, didn’t it?)
✦Annual household income: eBay states that this info is kept anony-
mous, but I think it’s too personal. If you’re not comfortable with it, 
skip it.
✦Your highest completed education level: Again, if this is too personal,
leave this area blank.
After selecting your responses from the drop-down box, you can click Submit.
Or you can click Answer Later, and the pop-up box will reappear for your
response later in your eBay dealings. If you don’t want to answer any of the
demographic queries, click Please Don’t Ask Me Again, at the bottom of the
pop-up window.
Picking a Pickproof Password
Choosing a good password is not as easy (but is twice as important) as it
may seem. Whoever has your password can (in effect) “be you” at eBay —
running auctions, bidding on auctions, and leaving possibly litigious feedback
for others. Basically, such an impostor can ruin your eBay career — and pos-
sibly cause you serious financial grief.
Many passwords can be cracked by the right person in a matter of seconds.
Your goal is to set a password that takes too much of the hackers’ time. With
the number of available users on eBay or PayPal, odds are they’ll go to the
next potential victim’s password rather than spend too many minutes (or
even hours) trying to crack yours.
As with any online password, you should follow these commonsense rules to
protect your privacy:
✦Don’t choose anything too obvious, such as your birthday, your first
name, or your Social Security number. (Hint: If it’s too easy to remember,
it’s probably too easy to crack.)
✦Make things tough on the bad guys — combine numbers and letters
(use uppercase and lowercase) or create nonsensical words.

Selecting Your User ID
40
✦Don’t give out your password to anyone — it’s like giving away the keys
to the front door of your house.
✦If you ever suspect someone has your password, immediately change it
by going to the Account Information area of your My eBay page or to the
following address:
pages.ebay.com/services/myebay/selectpass.html
✦Change your password every few months just to be on the safe side.
For more information on passwords and other security stuff, check out 
Book IX.
Selecting Your User ID
Making up a user ID is always a pleasant chore. If you’ve never liked your
real name or never had a nickname, here’s your chance to correct that situa-
tion. Choose an ID that tells a little about you. Of course, if your interests
change, you may regret too narrow a user ID.
You can call yourself just about anything, but remember that this ID is how
other eBay users will know you. Here are some guidelines:
✦Don’t use a name that would embarrass your mother.
✦Don’t use a name with a negative connotation.
✦Don’t use a name that’s too weird, such as scam-guy. If people don’t trust
you, they won’t buy from you.
✦eBay doesn’t allow spaces in user IDs, so make sure that the ID makes
sense when putting two or more words together. A friend of mine
intended to register as “gang of one.” She forgot the hyphens, so her
ID reads gangofone.
If you’re dying to have several short words as your user ID, you can use
underscores or hyphens to separate them, as in super-shop-a-holic. And if
you permanently sign in to eBay on your computer, you won’t have to worry
about typing a complicated ID.
You can change your user ID once every 30 days if you want to, but I don’t
recommend it because people come to know you by your user ID. If you
change your ID, your past does play tagalong and attaches itself to the new
ID. But if you change your user ID too many times, people may think you’re
trying to hide something.

Nevertheless, to change your user ID, click the My eBay link, which appears

My Account: Personal Information link, scroll to the User ID area, and click
the Change link. Fill in the boxes, and then click the Change User ID button.
You now have a new eBay identity.
eBay also has some user ID rules to live by:
✦No offensive names (such as &*#@guy).
✦No names with eBay in them. (It makes you look like you work for eBay,
and eBay takes a dim view of that.)
✦No names with & (even if you do have both looks&brains).
✦No names with @ (such as @Aboy).
✦No symbols, such as the greater than or less than symbol (> <), and no
consecutive underscores (__).
✦No IDs that begin with an e followed by numbers, an underscore, a
hyphen, a period, or dot (as in dot.com).
✦No names of one letter (such as Q from Star Trek).
When you choose your user ID, make sure that it isn’t a good clue for your
password. For example, if you use Natasha as your user ID, don’t choose
Boris as your password. Even Bullwinkle could figure that one out.
Hey, AOL users, this one’s for you. If you have Internet e-mail blocked, you
need to update your AOL Mail Controls to receive e-mail from eBay. To do so,
enter the AOL keyword Mail Controls.
Signing In to Deal
You don’t have to wear one of those tacky “Hello, my name is” stickers on
your shirt, but you and several million other folks will be roaming around
eBay’s online treasure trove. eBay needs to know who’s who when we’re
browsing. So, keeping that in mind, sign in when you first go on to the eBay
Web site, please!
By going to the Sign In page and signing in, you don’t have to enter your user
ID when you bid or post items for sale. The Sign In page also takes you to a
link that allows you to change your sign in or My eBay preferences. 
If you’re the only one who uses your computer, be sure to select the box that
says “Keep me signed in on this computer unless I sign out.” This way, you’re
always signed in to eBay every time you go to the site. The sign-in process
places a cookie (a techno-related thingy) on your computer that remains a

part of your browser until you sign out. If you don’t select the box, you will
be signed in only while you’re on the site. If there’s no activity for 40 minutes
or you close your browser, the cookie expires and you have to sign in again.
Here’s how to get to the eBay Sign In page and sign in:
1. Click the Sign In link below the navigation bar on any eBay page.
2. Enter your user ID and password.
If you’re on your home computer and want to make your eBay-ing easier,
click the box next to “Keep me signed in on this computer unless I sign
out.” Your password will be saved in the browser until you sign out,
even if you disconnect from the Internet, close your browser, or turn off
your computer.
3. Click Sign In Securely.
You’re now signed in to eBay and can travel the site with ease. You may go to
your My eBay page’s eBay Preferences to tell eBay where you want to land
after you sign in.
Verifying Your ID
During the later years of the Cold War, the late President Ronald Reagan said,
“Trust but verify.” The President’s advice made sense for dealing with the
Soviet Union in those days, and it makes good sense with your dealings at
eBay, too! (Even if you’re not dealing in nuclear warheads.)
To show other eBay members that you’re an honest type, you can buy a
“trust but verify” option, known as ID Verify, from eBay for five bucks. The
process is simple, and it allows new users of eBay to show other members
that they are earnest in their desire to become responsible members of the
community. A company called VeriSign verifies your identity by asking for
the following information:
✦Name
✦Address
✦Phone number
✦Social Security number
✦Driver’s license information
✦Date of birth
VeriSign matches the info you give to what’s in its humungous database and
presents you with a list of questions from your credit file that only you

Book I
Chapter 3
Signing Up and
Getting Started
eBay Is Watching Over You
43
should know the answer to. VeriSign may ask you about any loans you have,
for example, or what kinds of credit cards you own (and how many).
VeriSign sends only the results of its test (whether you pass the test) to eBay
and not the answers to the private financial questions it asks you. VeriSign
doesn’t modify or add information you provide to any of its databases.
VeriSign’s questions are meant to protect you against anyone else who may
come along and try to steal this information from you and assume your 
identity. The questions aren’t a credit check, and your creditworthiness is
never called into question. This info simply verifies that you are who you say
you are.
If you pass the test and VeriSign can verify that you are who you say you are
and not your evil twin (can you say “Mini Me”?), you get a cool icon by your
name. If any of your contact information changes, you have to reapply for a
new ID Verify logo.
Although you can feel secure knowing that a user who’s verified is indeed
who he or she claims to be, you still have no guarantee that he or she is not
going to turn out to be a no-goodnik (or, for that matter, a well-meaning
financial airhead) during auction transactions.
Aside from the identification feature, ID Verify offers other benefits to
buyers. ID Verify allows you to
✦Buy the Buy It Now items on the eBay site
✦Bid above $15,000 (lucky you!)
✦Access the Mature Audiences category
You should consider all of eBay’s programs for protecting you from problem-
atic transactions and people, but I think the undisputed heavyweight champ
for finding out who someone really is and keeping you out of trouble is the
first program eBay created. That’s right, folks; feedback can show you other
eBay members’ track records and give you the best information on whether
you want to do business with them or take a pass. Feedback is especially
effective if you analyze it with eBay’s other protection programs. I suggest
taking the time to read all about feedback in Chapter 7.
eBay Is Watching Over You
The Security Center is where eBay’s Trust and Safety gurus focus on protect-
ing the Web site from members who aren’t playing by the rules. Through this
department, eBay issues warnings and policy changes — and in some cases,
it gives eBay bad guys the old heave-ho.

eBay Is Watching Over You
44
You can find eBay’s Security Center by clicking the Security Center link at
the bottom of most eBay pages or the Services link above the navigation bar.
Trust and Safety’s Security Center page is more than just a link to policies
and information. It also connects you with a group of eBay staffers who
handle complaints, field incoming tips about possible infractions, and dole
out warnings and suspensions. The folks here investigate infractions and
send out e-mails in response to tips. eBay staffers look at complaints on a
case-by-case basis, in the order they receive them. Most complaints they
receive are about these problems:
✦Shill bidders (see the section on “Selling abuses” in this chapter)
✦Feedback issues and abuses (see the section on “Feedback abuses” in
this chapter)
Keep in mind that eBay is a community of people, most of whom have never
met each other. No matter what you buy or sell on eBay, don’t expect eBay
transactions to be any safer than buying or selling from a complete stranger.
If you go in with this attitude, you won’t be disappointed.
For an up-close online look at eBay’s rules and regulations, click the Policies
link, which is at the bottom of most eBay pages, and then read the User
Agreement. (The agreement is revised regularly, so check it often.)
Another helpful link is the FAQ (frequently asked questions) page for the
User Agreement, which explains the legalese in clearer English. To visit the
FAQ page, go to
pages.ebay.com/help/policies/user-agreement-faqs.html
If you plan on being an active eBay member, it’s probably worth your while
to opt-in for eBay’s User Agreement update e-mail. Go to your My eBay page
and click the eBay Preferences link in the My Account area. You’ll see your
Notification Preferences. To make a change, click View/Change. At this point,
you’re asked to type your password — this is to protect your security on
eBay. Then you go to the magic page where you can change all your eBay
notification preferences, including the User Agreement update.
Abuses you should report to Trust and Safety
Before you even consider blowing the whistle on someone who (gasp!) gave
you negative feedback by reporting him or her to Trust and Safety, make sure
that what you’re encountering is actually a misuse of eBay. Some behavior
isn’t nice (no argument there), but it also isn’t a violation of eBay rules —
in which case, eBay can’t do much about it. The following sections list the
primary reasons you may start Trust and Safety investigations.

Selling abuses
If you’re on eBay long enough, you’re bound to find an abuse of the service.
It may happen on an auction you’re bidding on, or it may be one of the sell-
ers who compete with your auctions. Be a good community member and be
on the lookout for the following:
✦Shill bidding: A seller uses multiple user IDs to bid or has accomplices
place bids to boost the price of his or her auction items. eBay investiga-
tors look for six telltale signs, including a single bidder putting in a really
high bid, a bidder with really low feedback but a really high number 
of bids on items, a bidder with low feedback who has been an eBay
member for a while but who’s never won an auction, or excessive bids
between two users.
✦Auction interception: An unscrupulous user, pretending to be the actual
seller, contacts the winner to set up terms of payment and shipping in an
effort to get the buyer’s payment. This violation can be easily avoided
by paying with PayPal directly through the eBay site.
✦Fee avoidance: A user reports a lower-than-actual final price or illegally
submits a Final Value Fee credit. Final Value Fee credits are explained in
Book III.
✦Bid manipulation: A user, with the help of accomplices, enters dozens 
of phony bids to make the auction appear to have a lot of bidding action.
Let the experts at eBay decide on this one; but you may wonder if loads
of bids come in rapid succession but the price moves very little.
Bidding abuses
If you want to know more about bidding in general, see Chapter 6. Here’s a
list of bidding abuses that eBay wants to know about:
✦Bid shielding: Two users work in tandem. User A, with the help of
accomplices, intentionally bids an unreasonably high amount and then
retracts the bid in the closing moments of the auction — leaving a lower
bid (which the offender or an accomplice places) as the winning bid.
✦Bid siphoning: Users send e-mail to bidders of a current auction to offer
the same merchandise for a lower price elsewhere.
✦Auction interference: Users warn other bidders through e-mail to stay
clear of a seller during a current auction, presumably to decrease the
number of bids and keep the prices low.
✦Bid manipulation (or invalid bid retraction): A user bids a ridiculously
high amount, raising the next highest bidder to the maximum bid. The
manipulator then retracts the bid and rebids slightly over the previous
high bidder’s maximum.

eBay Is Watching Over You
46
✦Unpaid item (nonpaying bidder): No matter how eBay chooses to
couch it by fancy verbiage, I call these bidders deadbeats. The bottom
line is that these people win auctions but never pay.
✦Unwelcome bidder: A user bids on a specific seller’s auction despite the
seller’s warning that he or she won’t accept that user’s bid (as in the
case of not selling internationally and receiving international bids). This
practice is impolite and obnoxious. If you want to ban specific bidders
from your auctions, you can exclude them in your My eBay area links.
Feedback abuses
All you have at eBay is your reputation, and that reputation is made up of
your feedback history. eBay takes any violation of its feedback system seri-
ously. Because eBay’s feedback is transaction related, unscrupulous eBay
members can no longer manipulate the system. Here’s a checklist of feed-
back abuses that you should report to Trust and Safety:
✦Feedback extortion: A member threatens to post negative feedback if
another eBay member doesn’t follow through on some unwarranted
demand.
✦Personal exposure: A member leaves feedback for a user that exposes
personal information that doesn’t relate to transactions on eBay.
✦–4 feedback: Any user reaching a net feedback score of –4 is subject to
suspension.
Identity abuses
Who you are on eBay is as important as what you sell (or buy). eBay moni-
tors the identities of its members closely — and asks that you report any
great pretenders in this area to Trust and Safety. Here’s a checklist of iden-
tity abuses:
✦Identity misrepresentation: A user claims to be an eBay staff member or
another eBay user or registers under the name of another user.
✦False or missing contact information: A user deliberately registers with
false contact information or an invalid e-mail address.
✦Underage: A user falsely claims to be 18 or older. (You must be at least
18 to enter into a legally binding contract.)
✦Dead or invalid e-mail address: When e-mails bounce repeatedly from a
user’s registered e-mail address, chances are good that the address is
dead. Usually return e-mail indicates that the address is unknown.
✦Contact information: One user publishes another user’s contact infor-
mation on the eBay site.

Operational abuses
If you see someone trying to interfere with eBay’s operation, eBay staffers
want you to tell them about it. Here are two roguish operational abuses:
✦Hacking: A user purposely interferes with eBay’s computer operations
(for example, by breaking into unauthorized files).
✦Spamming: The user sends unsolicited commercial e-mail to eBay users.
Miscellaneous abuses
The following are additional problems that you should alert eBay about:
✦A user is threatening physical harm to another eBay member.
✦A person uses racist, obscene, or harassing language in a public area
of eBay.
For a complete list of offenses and how eBay runs each investigation, go to
the following address:
pages.ebay.com/help/confidence/programs-investigations.html
See the next section for information on how to report violators to eBay.
Reporting abuses
If you suspect someone of abusing eBay’s rules and regulations, go to the
Security Center (the link is at the bottom of every eBay page) and click the
Report Problem link on the Security and Resolution Center main page. You
are presented with the form shown in Figure 3-5. From this page, click the
appropriate link for your issue.
If you have a troubled item and need to launch a report, follow these steps:
1. Read all the information on the Security and Resolution Center page
before filing a new complaint.
2. Click Report a Problem.
You arrive at that handy form shown in Figure 3-5.
3. Select the items that relate to your situation, and then click Continue.
4. If eBay presents you with a page full of links to teach you about their
policies and some possible solutions to your issue, review them. Then
scroll to the bottom of the page, and click Email.

5. In the form, type the item number (or numbers if they’re part of a
related problem) and give a thorough description of what transpired.
Figure 3-6 shows you the form for one type of transgression. Be sure to
review what you’ve written to confirm that your report is accurate.

6. Send the report by clicking Send Email.
Be sure you send only one report per case — and one case per report.
If you file a report, make your message clear and concise by including every-
thing that happened, but don’t editorialize. (Calling someone a “lowdown
mud-sucking cretin” doesn’t provide any useful info to anyone who can help
you and doesn’t reflect well on you either.) Keep it businesslike — just the
facts, ma’am. Do include all pertinent documentation, such as e-mails, receipts,
canceled checks — and (of course) the auction number.
Here’s a checklist of backup documentation you may need for your Trust
and Safety report:
✦Write only the facts as you know them.
✦Attach any pertinent e-mails with complete headers. (Headers are all the
information found at the top of an e-mail message.) Trust and Safety uses
the headers to verify how the e-mail was sent and to follow the trail back
to the author.
✦Be sure that the subject line of your report precisely names the 
violation.
If the clock is running out on your case (for example, you suspect bidding
offenses in a current auction), I suggest that you avail yourself of the Live
Help link, which appears on the eBay home page.
After eBay receives your report, you usually get an automatic response that
your e-mail was received. Several days may go crawling by before eBay
investigates your allegations. (They must look at a lot of transactions.)
Depending on the outcome of the probe, eBay may contact you with the
results. If your problem becomes a legal matter, eBay may not let you know
what’s going on. The only indication you may get that some action was 
taken is that the eBay member you reported is suspended, or NARU (Not A
Registered User).
If your complaint doesn’t warrant an investigation by the folks at Trust 
and Safety, they pass it along to someone from the overworked customer-
support staff, who then contacts you. (Don’t bawl out the person if the 
attention you get is tardy.)
Unfortunately, NARU members can show up again on the eBay site. Typically,
nefarious sorts as these just use a different name. In fact, this practice is
common, so beware! If you suspect that someone who broke the rules once
is back under another user ID, alert Trust and Safety. If you’re a seller, you
can refuse to accept bids from that person. If the person persists, alert 
customer support by e-mail.

As eBay has grown, so has the number of complaints about slow response
from customer support. I don’t doubt that eBay staffers are doing their best.
Although slow response can get frustrating, avoid the temptation to initiate a
reporting blitzkrieg by sending reports over and over until eBay can’t ignore
you. This practice is risky at best and inconsiderate at worst, and it just slows
down the process for everyone — and won’t endear the e-mail bombardier
to the folks who could help.
If you’re desperate for help and can’t find a Live Help link, you can post a
message with your problem in one of the eBay chat rooms. eBay members
participating in chat rooms often share the names of helpful staffers. Often
you can find some eBay members who faced the same problem (sometimes
with the same member) and can offer advice — or at the very least, compas-
sion and a virtual ear. (Jump to Chapter 8 for more info on discussion boards
and chat rooms.)
If you’re a PowerSeller, you can always contact PowerSeller support with
your immediate problem.
Make sure that you don’t violate any eBay rules by sharing any member’s
contact information as you share your story in a chat room. In addition,
make sure that you don’t threaten or libel (that is, say untrue things or
spread rumors about) the person in your posting.
Don’t get caught in a trading violation
Playing by eBay’s rules keeps you off the Trust and Safety radar screen. If
you start violating eBay policies, the company’s going to keep a close eye
on you. Depending on the infraction, eBay may be all over you like jelly on
peanut butter. Or you may safely lurk in the fringes until your feedback
rating is lower than the temperature in Nome in November.
Here’s a docket of eBay no-no’s that can get members flogged and 
keelhauled — or at least suspended:
✦Feedback rating of –4
✦Three instances of deadbeat bidding
✦Repeated warning for the same infraction
✦Feedback extortion
✦Bid shielding
✦Unwelcome bidding after a warning from the seller
✦Shill bidding

Book I
Chapter 3

51
✦Auction interception
✦Fee avoidance
✦Fraudulent selling
✦Identity misrepresentation
✦Bidding when younger than age 18
✦Hacking
✦Physical threats
If you get a suspension but think you’re innocent, respond directly to the
person who suspended you to plead your case. Reversals do occur. Don’t
broadcast your suspicions on chat boards. If you’re wrong, you may regret it.
Even if you’re right, it’s oh-so-gauche.
Be careful about accusing members of cheating. Unless you’re involved in a
transaction, you don’t know all the facts. Perry Mason moments are great on
television, but they’re fictional for a reason. In real life, drawing yourself into
a possible confrontation is senseless. Start the complaint process, keep it
businesslike, and let eBay’s staff figure out what’s going on.

S
ometimes, when you know exactly what you want to buy, you find not
one but many auctions with that item for sale. In this situation, knowing
the different eBay sales formats is important. In this chapter, I go over the
various types of sales and show you the ways to use each type to your
advantage.
Checking Out the Listing Page
All item pages on eBay — whether auctions, fixed-price items, or Buy It Now
items — look about the same. Figure 4-1 shows a conventional auction item
page. If you were viewing this auction page on the screen, you could scroll
down and see a complete description of the item, along with shipping 
information.
eBay auction listings have some subtle differences. (With a venue as big as
eBay, you gotta have some flexibility.) Some auctions feature a picture at the
top of the page and some don’t, depending on how the seller sets up his or
her sale page. You may also see the words Financing Available (more on that
later). Some auctions also have preset item specifics above the description
written by the seller. If you’re looking at an item in a fixed-price sale, you’ll
see the words Buy It Now, as shown in Figure 4-2.

✦Item category: Located just above the item title and number bar, you
can click the category listing and do some comparison shopping. 
(Book II, Chapter 1 gives more searching strategies.)
✦Item title and number: The title and number identify the item. Keep
track of this info for inquiries later. Some sellers (refer to Figures 4-1 and
4-2) also use a subtitle to pass on more information about their items.
If you’re interested in a particular type of item, take note of the keywords
used in the title (you’re likely to see them again in future titles). Doing so
helps you narrow down your searches.
✦Watch this item: Click this link, and the item is magically added to the
Watching area of your My eBay All Buying page so you can keep an eye
on the progress of the auction — without actually bidding. If you haven’t
signed in, you have to type your user ID and password before you can
save the auction to your My eBay page.
✦Starting bid or Current bid: This is the dollar amount that the bidding
has reached. The amount changes throughout the auction as people place
bids. If no bids have been placed on the item, it will read Starting bid.
Sometimes, next to the current dollar amount, you see Reserve not met
or Reserve met. This means the seller has set a reserve price for the 
item — a secret price that must be reached before the seller will sell 
the item. Most auctions do not have reserve prices.
✦Time left: Although the clock never stops ticking on eBay, you must con-
tinue to refresh your browser to see the time remaining on the official
clock. When the item gets down to the last hour of the auction, you’ll see
the time expressed in minutes and seconds.
Timing is the key in an eBay bidding strategy (covered in Chapter 6), so
don’t forget that eBay uses Pacific standard time (PST) or Pacific day-
light time (PDT) as the standard, depending on the season.
✦Start time: The time that the seller began the sale on eBay.
✦History: This field tells you how many bids have been placed. The start-
ing bid is listed in light gray next to the number of bids. When the listing
is live, you can click the number of bids to find out who is bidding and
when bids were placed. (In some circumstances, only the seller and
buyer can access this data.)
You can click the number of bids to see how the bidding action is going,
but you won’t be able to see the high bidder’s proxy bid.
✦High bidder: This field shows you the user ID and feedback rating of the
current high bidder. It could be you if you’ve placed a bid!
Sometimes an item has no bids because everyone is waiting until the
last minute. Then you see a flurry of activity as bidders try to outbid
each other (called sniping, which Chapter 6 explains). It’s all part of the
fun of eBay.

Checking Out the Listing Page
56
✦Buy It Now price: If you want an item immediately and the price listed in
this area is okay with you, click Buy It Now. You will be taken to a page
where you can complete your purchase. Buy It Now is an option and
does not appear in all listings.
✦Quantity: This field appears only when multiple items are available. If
you see a number other than 1 in this field and the item is open to bid,
you’re looking at a multiple-item auction (Dutch auction), which I
describe later in this chapter. If it’s a multiple-item, fixed-price sale, you
have no opportunity to bid — you use Buy It Now to purchase whatever
quantity of the item you want. You’ll be prompted for a quantity when
you buy.
✦Item location: This field tells you at the very least the country where the
seller is located. You may also see more specific info, such as the seller’s
city and geographic area. (What you see depends on how detailed the
seller chooses to be.) The item location is handy if you’d like to pick up
the item — but e-mail the seller first to see whether he or she would be
willing to meet you at the local Starbucks to complete the transaction.
✦Ships to: If the seller ships to only the United States, it will state so here.
If the seller ships to any other countries, this is where they will be listed.
✦Shipping costs: If the seller is willing to ship the item anywhere in the
country for a flat rate, you’ll see it here. This area may also link to eBay’s
shipping calculator if the seller customizes the shipping expense based
on weight and distance.
✦Seller Information box: This area, on the right side of the page, gives
you information about the seller. Know thy seller ranks right after caveat
emptor as a phrase that pays at eBay. As I tell you nearly a million times
in this book, read the feedback rating! (Okay, maybe not a million — it
would drive the editors bonkers.) Like any community, eBay has its
share of good folks and bad folks. Your best defense is to read the
seller’s feedback. You’ll see several things in the Seller Information box
(as shown in Figure 4-3):
• Seller icons: Various icons that show the status of the seller. A varied
color star reflects the feedback level of the seller. If the seller is a
PowerSeller, you see the PowerSeller icon. If the seller has an About
Me page, you see the blue and red me icon.
• Feedback score: This number is also to the right of the seller’s name
in parentheses. Click the number next to the seller’s ID to view his or
her eBay ID card and entire feedback history. Read, read, and reread
all the feedback to make sure you feel comfortable doing business
with this person.
• Positive feedback percentage: The eBay computers calculate this
figure. It’s derived from all the positive and negative feedback that a
user receives.

• Member since: This line lists the date the seller joined eBay and the
country in which he or she registered.
• Read feedback comments: This link does the same thing as clicking
the feedback score.
• Add to Favorite Sellers: Clicking here adds the seller to your My
eBay Favorite Sellers links.
• Ask seller a question: Clicking this link hooks you up with eBay’s
e-mail system so you can ask the seller a question regarding the item.
• View seller’s other items: This link takes you to a page that lists all
the seller’s current auctions and fixed-price sales.
• Visit this seller’s eBay store: If the seller has an eBay store, a link to
it appears here as well. I give you a step-by-step guide on how these
links work later in this chapter.
• PayPal: If the seller accepts PayPal, the PayPal logo appears here.
Also, if the seller qualifies for buyer protection, this is also indicated
here, as shown in Figure 4-3.
• Financing available: If an item is selling for more than $200, and the
seller has approved it, the buyer may finance the purchase through
PayPal.
✦Description bar: Below this light-blue shaded bar is the item description.
There may also be a colorful header with links to the seller’s eBay store.
Also, if the seller participates with SquareTrade or is bonded through
BuySAFE, those company’s seals will appear in the item description area.
Read all this information carefully before bidding.

Below the seller’s description area, you’ll find some other important data on
the typical auction item page, as shown in Figure 4-4:
✦Shipping and payment details: Check here to see the details on ship-
ping. You see
• Whether the seller is charging flat shipping or is offering more than
one shipping option through a shipping calculator.
• Who pays (usually the buyer).
• Whether insurance is offered.
• Which states have to pay sales tax (if any) and the sales tax rate.
• Whether the seller is willing to ship to your area. (Sometimes sellers
won’t ship internationally, and they’ll let you know here.)
Be sure to also check the item description for other shipping informa-
tion and terms.
✦Payment methods accepted: This field tells you the payment methods
that the seller accepts — checks, money orders, credit cards, or PayPal.

Bidding on Auctions

Be sure to use the Watch This Item feature when shopping around.
Organization is the name of the game on eBay, especially if you plan to bid
on multiple auctions while you’re running auctions of your own. I figure
you’re in the bidding game to win, so start keeping track of items now.
Bidding on Auctions
To give you a sense of the auction process, here’s a real-world example 
of my addictions put to the eBay test. I searched and found an item that I
wanted, a “New York Pizza.” After reading the seller’s feedback (and skipping
lunch), I wanted the item even more! None of this seller’s previous buyers
were unhappy with the product. As a matter of fact, no one seems able to
say enough about the quality of their food. Yum! (If I buy the pizza for
research for this book, it makes my pizza a tax write-off, no?)
The pizza’s starting bid is $9.95, and the auction ends in over four days. So I
need to observe several things about the auction. How many more are up for
sale? A simple search shows that only one is up for auction. What did they
sell for in the past? I run a completed auctions search, and see that they’ve
sold for up to $20. (Shipping is free — this is as good as Dominos!)
You have to make some decisions. I have observed that these pizza auctions
have an active bidding pattern, so at this early stage I bid the minimum
amount just to get the item to show up as one of the items in the All Buying
area of the My eBay page.
Bidding can be like games of poker. If you want to win a one-of-a-kind item,
don’t show your hand to other bidders. Simply mark the auction to watch.
However, this strategy isn’t necessary for an item that will be sure to be
listed again, like the New York Pizza.
When it comes to auctions, the highest bid wins. Remember this please. People
are constantly boo-hooing because they’ve been outbid at the last minute (or
sniped, as I explain in Chapter 6). You can’t be outbid if you’re the high bidder!
If you’re interested in an item but you don’t have the time to follow it closely
from the beginning of the auction to its conclusion, you can place a proxy
bid. See “Automatic bidding” for more information. You can also go to the
seller’s eBay store to see whether a duplicate item is for sale at a fixed price.
Automatic bidding
Bidding on eBay goes up by prescribed increments. But what if you’re not
able to sit in on an auction 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, upping your bid
every time someone bids against you? (You mean you have a life?)

Bidding on Auctions
60
You do receive e-mail messages from eBay to let you know that you’ve been
outbid, but eBay’s computers are often busy doing other things and you
might not get the notice in time to place a new competitive bid.
Enter eBay’s automatic bidding system. This is the perfect way to place your
bid for the highest amount you are willing to pay for an item — without
spending your valuable time constantly following the auction. Before you
place your proxy bid, you should give serious thought to how much you
want to pay for the item
When you place an automatic bid (a proxy bid) on eBay, eBay’s bidding
engine will only place enough of your bid to outbid the previous bidder.
If there are no previous bidders and the seller has not entered a reserve
price, your bid will appear as the minimum auction bid until someone bids
against you. Your bid will be increased incrementally in response to other
bids against yours. Table 4-1 lists eBay’s bidding increments.

you and becomes the high bidder.

your maximum bid, or click the Place Bid button, as shown in Figure 4-5.

Bidding on Auctions
61
If the seller has set a Buy It Now price and you’re too impatient to wait until
the end of the auction to win, click Buy It Now. A confirmation page appears.
You have one last chance to back out. If everything is in order, click either
Buy It Now or Confirm Bid (depending on the type of transaction). Or, if you
get cold feet, click Back to Item. To find out more about the Buy It Now option,
see “Buying an Item Outright,” later in this chapter.
After you’ve placed your bid, the next page lets you know whether you’re
the high bidder or whether your purchase has been confirmed if you
decided to use Buy It Now.
If you’re not the high bidder in an auction, just scroll down the acknowledg-
ment page to the rebidding area and place another bid.
Understanding reserve prices
You’ll often come across auctions that have the words Reserve not met next
to the bid amount. By placing a reserve on the auction, the seller ensures
that the item will not sell until the bidding reaches the mysterious reserve
figure.
Figure 4-5:
Enter your
high bid or
click Buy 
It Now.

Buying an Item Outright
62
If you’re really interested in an item with a reserve, e-mail the seller and
politely ask how much the reserve is. Some sellers guard the reserve amount
like the crown jewels but others graciously reveal the figure. The point of the
reserve is to protect their investment and get qualified bidders, not waste
your time.
Private auctions
Private auctions are handled the same way as plain-vanilla auctions, except
no one but the buyer and seller knows who the winner is. As a matter of fact,
all bidders’ names are hidden from investigation from anyone other than the
seller.
After you’ve been on eBay a while, you might see the same group of names
bidding on the same auctions as you. I like bidding in private auctions
because they’re handy for snaring items secretly, without my regular com-
petitors knowing that I’m bidding on the item. (See Chapter 6 for bidding
strategies.)
Multiple-item auctions
A multiple-item, or Dutch, auction allows a seller to auction multiple identi-
cal items. You can bid on one or as many of the item as you want. When the
total number of items has been bid upon at the opening price, the next bids
have to beat the previous bids by one bidding increment.
When the auction is over, all winning bidders (those with the highest bids)
win their items at the lowest bid price. I know that sounds ridiculous, but
that’s the way it works. I’m only reporting this — it must have taken a cre-
ative mind to come up with this theory of auctions. If you want a more 
in-depth description of the Dutch process, go to eBay and read their 
description:
http://pages.ebay.com/help/buy/buyer-multiple.html
To place a bid in a Dutch auction, you must input the amount of items you
want to bid on and the amount you want to bid per item.
Buying an Item Outright
Although eBay’s success was built on auctions, eBay also allows sellers to
handle outright sales. You can make a direct purchase

✦By using the Buy It Now feature in an eBay auction
✦In a fixed-price sale on the auction site
✦In one of eBay’s stores
Buy It Now
You may have already looked at auctions and seen a Buy It Now price below
the minimum or starting bid amount. That little indicator means that if you
want the item badly enough, and the Buy It Now price is within your budget,
you can end the auction right then and there by buying the item for the
stated amount.
Before using the Buy It Now option (because you think you’ve hit upon a bar-
gain), be sure to check the seller’s shipping charges. Many sellers set a low
Buy It Now price but place a high shipping amount on the item to make up
their missing profits. If the shipping amount isn’t listed, be sure to e-mail the
seller and ask for the shipping amount. A Buy It Now transaction is final; you
can’t withdraw your commitment to buy.
If you decide that you want to buy, scroll down to the bottom of the page
and click the Buy It Now button. An eBay confirmation page appears. If you
still want to make the purchase, you can click Confirm to tell eBay that
you’re willing to pay the purchase price. Then all you have to do is go
through the checkout process and pay the seller.
You can still place a bid on an auction that has a Buy It Now option. When
you do, the option to immediately buy disappears and the item goes into
auction mode. If the item has a reserve, the Buy It Now option doesn’t disap-
pear until the bidding surpasses the reserve amount.
Fixed-price sales
eBay also offers items for sale without the option to bid. These fixed-price
listings may be for a single item or for multiple items. When multiple items
are offered (see Figure 4-6), you can buy as many as you like.
Shopping eBay stores
eBay stores are the secret weapon for knowledgeable eBay shoppers. First,
of course, you can consistently find great deals. But you can also help small
businesses make it against the behemoths. Sellers open eBay stores to make
searching merchandise easier for buyers; stores also help save sellers
money because sellers don’t need to set up private e-commerce Web sites.
Translation? Sellers can list items in their eBay stores for even lower fees,
passing their savings on to you, the savvy bargain hunter.

Buying an Item Outright
64
Before you buy any item from a listing on eBay, check to see whether the seller
has the small, red stores icon next to his or her user ID. If so, be sure to click
the icon before you bid on the item. Most sellers run auctions for items to
draw people into their eBay stores, where you may be able to find more inter-
esting merchandise you can buy along with your item and save on shipping.
You can get to the eBay Stores hub from the eBay home page by clicking the
eBay Stores link under the Specialty Sites heading or by typing the following
Web address:
www.ebaystores.com
At the center of the eBay Stores hub page, as shown in Figure 4-7, you see a
small group of store logos. These logos change every few minutes as eBay
rotates its anchor stores through the area. Store owners pay a considerable
amount to have their stores listed as anchor stores.
Below the store logos is a list of clickable links to stores. These are featured
stores. You can find more stores, including the smallest ones — the cottage
industry sellers — by clicking one of the category links on the left side of 
the page.
Strolling through an eBay store
When you finally arrive at the eBay store of your choice, you see a page that
looks similar to the one in Figure 4-8. An eBay store displays not only the
items that the seller has listed in the store but also every active auction or
Buy It Now item the seller has placed on the eBay site.

Most eBay stores have a column on the left side of the home page that dis-
plays the following:
✦Store search: Below the store name banner is a column topped by a
search box that allows you to search all the items this seller has for sale.
✦Store categories: eBay store owners may assign their own custom cate-
gories to the items they sell to better organize things within the store.
You may click individual categories to see items in that classification
from that seller.
✦Display: You can decide how you’d like to view the items in the seller’s
store. Figure 4-8 shows you the store in gallery view and the remaining
time before the auction ends. 
✦Store policies: This area shows the terms and conditions of the seller’s
auctions.
✦About the seller: The last entry in this section is the seller’s About Me
page.
At the top of the store home page, you’ll see several things:
✦The store name: This is the name the store owner has chosen for 
the store. Each eBay store has its own address that ends in the eBay
store’s name, like this: www.stores.ebay.com/insertstorename. For
example, my store’s URL is www.stores.ebay.com/marshacolliers
fabulousfinds.com. Because www.ebaystores.com also gets you to
the eBay Stores hub, an alternative URL for my store also works:
www.ebaystores.com/marshacolliersfabulousfinds.
✦Seller’s user ID and feedback rating: Below the store name, next to
Maintained by, is the seller’s user ID and the ubiquitous feedback rating.
✦Add to my Favorite Stores: If you click this link, the store is added to
your All Favorites page in your My eBay area.
✦Store logo and description: In the middle of the page is the store’s
graphic logo, and to the right of that is the seller’s description of the
store. (This is the area that is searched when you search Stores by store
name and description.)

Real estate
Since the founding of our country, land has been valued as a great commod-
ity; passed from generation to generation. As Gerald O’Hara so eloquently
put it, “it’s the only thing that lasts.” (Remember that scene from “Gone with
the Wind?”) People buy land for investment, vacations, or retirement. It’s
no longer common for a family to spend their entire life in one home. Real
estate, although a major purchase, is becoming more and more an everyday
transaction.
The smart people at eBay are sly trend-spotters, so they opened an official
category for real estate transactions in fall 2000. You can access eBay’s Real
Estate category through the category link on the left side of the home page
or by going directly to
http://www.ebayrealestate.com
Because substantial legal restrictions are involved in real estate transac-
tions, sellers can choose to list their properties as an auction or in the form
of an advertisement depending on the laws in their area.
When you participate in a listing that is in an ad format, you do not place
bids. At the bottom of the item’s description page is a form for you to fill out
that’s sent to the seller. After the seller receives this information, he or she
can contact you, and the two of you may negotiate privately. When you
browse the Residential Homes category, a small ad icon in the Bids column
indicates items listed as advertisements. Most residential home sales are
handled in this manner. Land and timeshares are typically sold in the auc-
tion format.
Because of a wide variety of laws governing the intricacies and legalities in
real estate transactions, the auction format may be nonbinding. Before get-
ting involved in any real estate transactions on eBay, I suggest you read the
official rules, which you can find on the following page:
pages.ebay.com/help/policies/real-estate-rules.html
Cruising eBay Motors
Buying a car is one purchase that I don’t enjoy making. Please don’t misun-
derstand. I love cars and have a personal attachment to every car I’ve owned.
It’s just that each time I’m approached by a car salesperson, I get intimidated.
The minute the salesperson says “I’ve got to check with my sales manager to
see if I can do that,” I know I’m a goner. And when I’ve finally decided on the
car model I want, I still have to face the deal, when the finance manager tries
to sell me warranties, alarms, and extras that I never wanted or needed. I feel
the need to run out of the dealership — and I usually do.

Supercategories and Specialties

If this feeling is familiar to you, I would like to introduce you to the sweetest
deal of the 21st century, eBay Motors (see Figure 4-9). In 2003, eBay sellers
sold more than $7.5 billion in the eBay Motors venue alone. I’d say that makes
eBay just about the largest auto mall in the universe. On the down-to-earth
side, Jupiter Media Metrix, the premier analyst of the Internet, recently
ranked eBay Motors the number one automotive site on the Web.
For some of us, eBay Motors is a magnificent fantasy site. I have a friend who
browses the Volkswagen bus category; his eyes glaze over with hope and
awe as he reads each listing. I’m sure he’s reliving his hippy days of the late
'60s. Another friend reads the Ferrari and Lamborghini listings; he pooh-
poohs all the aftermarket changes to the classics. My best friend checks out
the vintage Thunderbirds and pictures herself as Suzanne Somers flirting
with the guys in American Graffiti. Then of course there’s my fantasy car;
the buttercup yellow Rolls Royce Corniche convertible driven by Teensy in
Ya-Ya Sisterhood. (I’ve yet to find one on eBay in that color — but then again,
I couldn’t afford one if I did find it!)
Many of the cars on eBay Motors are private-party sales, bank cars (repos-
sessions), and cars that have been cherry picked by wholesalers and dealer
overstocks. In addition, professional car dealers sell rare, hard-to-find cars to
a marketplace that draws between 4 and 5 million visitors per month. You

Finding more than cars
The truly amazing part about eBay Motors is
that it has more than just the usual cars and
vans. In fact, the rule seems to be that if it has
an engine, you’ll find it here. Here’s a descrip-
tion of the Other Vehicles categories:
 ATVs: Within the ATV subcategory of
Powersports, you’ll find a wide selection of
new and used 4x4s and 2x4s, 3 wheelers
and 4 wheelers. I even found a few 6-wheel
amphibious vehicles! Bidding in this cate-
gory is active and the items move quickly.
 Aircraft: Anything that flies can be found
here: hot air balloons to military trainer jets.
Browsing this category is amazing. Who
could imagine that with a click of your
mouse (and enough money) you could own
your own Bell helicopter or Gulfstream jet?
If you’ve ever dreamt of taking up flying,
this might be the category to get your
hobby started!
 Boats : This category was so full that I got
seasick just browsing! It has it’s own sub-
categories of Fishing Boats, Personal
Watercraft (Sea-Doo, Yamaha, Kawasaki,
and so on), Powerboats, Sailboats, and
Other (kayaks, canoes, pontoons, tenders,
and dinghies). I know boats, and I saw
some great deals in this category. There
were some beautiful Bass boats and
Boston Whalers at incredible prices. A
dozen or so Bayliners caught my eye, espe-
cially the 47-foot Pilot House Motoryacht
with a starting bid of $290,000.00 (sigh). It
was also nice to see a wide selection of
prices for sailboats. With some time spent
shopping in this category, you can find just
about anything you want within your price
range.
 Buses: No kidding. You want to start your
own bus line? Here’s the place to find the
buses — and it seems that plenty of people
are interested in them! There’s active bid-
ding on old school buses in this category
(and I thought the American family was
getting smaller!).
 Commercial trucks: Since commercial
trucks are something I know jack about, 
I went to some experts who browsed the
site and examined the deals. Here’s their
review for those in the know. The items are
good quality and of the type they’d like to
find at commercial truck auctions. The
prices are bargains and they say they’ll be
visiting the site regularly from now on —
sounds like a good recommendation to me!
 Scooters and minibikes: Aside from what
you’d expect to find here, this is the home
for beautiful vintage and new Vespa motor
scooters.
 Snowmobiles: I’ve never lived in a snowy
part of the country, so I can only imagine
how much fun these bad boys are. You’ll
see everything from top-of-the-line new
ones to gently used private sales.
 Other: How about a 1947 Coca-Cola vend-
ing truck — complete with fountain, cotton
candy machine, and propane-powered 
hot dog cooker! Sounds like a carnival 
on wheels! Well, okay, it doesn’t run, but
hey — it’s only $3000! There’s also a Shelby
Cobra kit, with no motor or tranny, but you
need a hobby, don’t you? I also found a
Think Neighbor electric vehicle; a sandrail
dune buggy 4-seater; go-karts, and car
haulers. There’s nothing you can’t find on
eBay!

can’t get that many people through the door at a local dealership! Dealers
put up the rare colors and limited edition vehicles because this is an auction
site, and the rarer an item the more likely bidders are to get excited. The
more excited bidders are, the more they lose their heads — and the higher
the price goes.
With an average of seven to eight bids per sale, eBay Motors is a competitive
environment for the most desirable cars. Dealers can sell cars for less on
eBay because it costs them less to sell. (They don’t have to pay the finance
manager to twist your arm to buy the extras.)
You can enter the eBay Motors site in two ways. Click the eBay Motors link
at the top left of the eBay home page, or go to

When it comes to unique shopping, the supercategories are the place to go.
On the eBay home page, take a look at the long list of links on the left. Below
the major category listing links are a few links to even more eBay special

These specialized categories have been put together by the eBay gurus to
encompass areas of interest that cover more than one category. On the eBay
home page, you’ll currently find the following (eBay will no doubt add more
in the future):
✦Business Marketplace
✦Live Auctions
✦Giving Works (Charity)
✦Wholesale
These supercategories come in handy when you’re looking for cross-
category merchandise.
Business Marketplace
If you’re looking for anything to outfit a business, Business Marketplace is the
place to go. Shown in Figure 4-10, Business Marketplace covers everything
from tractor parts to welding equipment to computers. You can browse the
category of your choice and see what’s available.

eBay Live Auctions
The Live Auctions area of the eBay site is one of the most exciting places to
visit, especially during an auction. You can bid or just watch a live auction of
some of the finest items in the world. I’ve spent many a fun afternoon with
the smallest dream that I might be able to bid with the big boys on some of
these special auctions.
If you don’t want to bid, you can watch the bidding on your screen in real
time by using the viewing function. Just click the box to indicate (during or
just before the live auction) that you’d like to just watch the action. All the
software is in your browser — you need nothing special.
Ladies, you don’t have to put on diamond jewelry and get all dressed up to
attend these auctions — and gentlemen, black tie is not necessary. As a
matter of fact, you can now bid against the Vanderbilts from your home in
your jammies and fuzzy slippers. Champagne and caviar hors d’oeuvres are
optional.

From the Live Auctions home page, shown in Figure 4-11, you can view the
entire catalog of items for sale in one of the upcoming live auctions. If you
want to participate in the auction, sign up in advance, just in case the auc-
tion house has to verify your credit card account information.
When you bid in a live auction, whether in person or on eBay Live Auctions,
you are required to pay a buyer’s premium. A buyer’s premium, which goes to
the auction house, runs between 15 and 20% of the final sale price. Before
you sign up for an auction, be sure to read all the terms and conditions of
the auctioneer, and factor this extra charge into your highest bidding price
before you even consider placing a bid.
When you come to the home page of an individual live auction, be sure to
click the View All Lots link so you can see all the items for sale. That’s how
you’ll find the unseen gem.
You don’t have to be at your computer at the time of the auction to partici-
pate. Instead, you can place an absentee bid. You may think you can’t afford
anything being auctioned, but many times items do go for low bids. You can’t
win if you don’t play, so if you see something you really want, bid. You just
might win.

Giving Works: Giving back to nonprofits
Many charitable organizations are selling their wares on eBay to raise money
for their fine work. You can get some rare and unusual items here, such as
the annual NBC Today Show Green Room autograph book. This one-of-a-kind
book has signatures and notes from the famous guests of the Today Show.
One of these Green Room books sold for $87,500! The superhot auction was
for lunch with Warren Buffet (the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway); it raised
$250,000.
eBay has partnered with the leader in online charitable auctions, MissionFish,
which has been helping organizations turn donations into cash through
online auctions since 2000. MissionFish works with regular eBay sellers to
raise money for nonprofit organizations.
When you list an item on eBay, you can choose a nonprofit from a certified
list and designate a percentage of the proceeds (from 20 to 100%) to donate.
The item appears in the search results with a Charity Auction icon. When
you go to the item page, you’ll see the name of the nonprofit, some informa-
tion about it, and the percentage of the final bid that the seller is donating.
You can search eBay for your favorite nonprofits by name.

In This Chapter
 Giving feedback
 Checking out the seller’s reputation
 Comparing items
 Playing it safe with buyer protection programs
W
hen you’re shopping on eBay, you’re faced with hundreds of items,
perhaps even hundreds of listings for the same item. How do you
decide where to place your order or your bid? In this chapter, I show you
the tools on eBay that guide you to a safe and positive transaction.
Understanding and Giving Feedback
One of eBay’s strong suits has been the formation of a sense of community
through its use of message boards, chats, and feedback. Many experts say
the reason eBay has succeeded where dozens of other dot-com auction sites
have failed is that eBay has always paid close attention to the needs of its
users.
Even in the early days, the concept was clear. Pierre and his employees fig-
ured that if users complained openly (for all other members to see), feedback
would be more genuine — not so much flaming as constructive. The “do unto
others” philosophy prevailed; above all else, Pierre encouraged buyers and
sellers to give each other the benefit of the doubt and to conduct themselves
professionally.
It soon became clear to eBay’s three employees that they did not have time
to adjudicate member disputes. And thus, the feedback system was born.
But the piece de resistance of feedback policy, the part that makes eBay
work, is the fact that Pierre and his staff encouraged users to give positive
feedback as often as they give negative or neutral feedback.

Understanding and Giving Feedback
76
The benefits of the feedback policy are immediately clear. Before even plac-
ing a bid with a seller, a buyer (you) can check the experience other eBay
buyers have had doing business with this seller. You can see whether items
in a seller’s previous auctions shipped quickly, whether items were packed
carefully, whether communication was clear and frequent, and so on. You
now have more information about an eBay seller then you have when you
walk into a new store in your neighborhood!
Every eBay member has a feedback rating. Buyers rate sellers, and sellers
rate buyers — no one is immune. A seller might comment on how quickly
you paid for an item, how well you communicated, or how you reacted to a
problem.
Feedback comes in three exciting flavors:
✦Positive feedback: Someone once said, “All you have is your reputa-
tion.” Reputation is what makes eBay function. If the transaction works
well, you get positive feedback; whenever it’s warranted, you should
give it right back.
✦Negative feedback: If there’s a glitch (for instance, it takes six months to
get your Charlie’s Angels lunchbox, or the seller substitutes a rusty ther-
mos for the one you bid on, or you never get the item), you have the
right — some would say obligation — to leave negative feedback.
✦Neutral feedback: You can leave neutral feedback if you feel so-so about
a specific transaction. It’s the middle-of-the-road comment that’s useful
when, for example, you bought an item that has a little more wear and
tear on it than the seller indicated, but you still like it and want to keep it.
You’re not required to leave feedback, but because it’s the benchmark by
which all eBay users are judged, you should always leave feedback comments
whether you’re buying or selling. Every time you complete a transaction — the
minute the package arrives safely whether you’re a seller or a buyer — you
should go to eBay and post your feedback.
The magic feedback number
You know how they say you are what you eat? At eBay, you are only as good as
your feedback says you are. Your feedback is made up of comments — good,
bad, or neutral — that people leave about you (and you leave about others).
In effect, people are commenting on your overall professionalism. (Even if
you’re an eBay hobbyist with no thought of using eBay professionally, a little
businesslike courtesy can ease your transactions with everyone.) These com-
ments are the basis for your eBay reputation. You wouldn’t be caught dead in
a store that has a lousy reputation, so why on Earth would you want to do
business on the Internet with someone who has a lousy reputation?

When you get your first feedback, the number that appears next to your user
ID is your feedback rating, which follows you everywhere you go on eBay,
even if you change your user ID or e-mail address. It sticks to you like glue.
Click the number next to any user ID and get a complete look at the user’s
feedback profile. This number is a net figure of the positive and negative
comments that were left for that eBay user. For example, if you get 50 posi-
tive comments and 49 negative comments, your feedback rating is 1.
Anyone with a –4 rating has his or her eBay membership terminated. And just
because someone has a high feedback rating, you should always click the
number after the name to double-check the person’s eBay ID card. Even if
someone has a total of 1000 feedback messages, 250 of them could be negative.
For every positive comment you receive, you get a plus 1. For every negative
comment, you get a minus 1. Negative comments deduct from your total of
positive comments, thereby lowering the number beside your user ID.
Theoretically, if you play nice, your feedback rating grows as you spend
more time using eBay.
The number, as it grows, shows not only how good a customer or seller you
are, but also how experienced you are at doing business on the site.
A neutral comment is neither negative nor positive and doesn’t change the
number that appears after your user ID. Neutral comments are used most
often when someone is not completely happy with a transaction, but not so
unhappy that they choose to destroy someone else’s reputation over the 
situation.
eBay riddle: When is more than 1 still 1? Gotcha, huh? The answer is, when
you get more than one feedback message from the same person. Confused?
This should help: You can sell one person 100 different items, but even if the
buyer gives you a glowing review 100 times, your feedback rating doesn’t
increase by 100. In this case, the other 99 feedback comments appear in your
feedback profile, but your rating increases by only 1. There’s something else:
Say you sell to the same eBay user twice. The user can give you positive
feedback in one case and negative feedback in another case — neutralizing
your feedback by netting you a 0 feedback rating from this person. eBay set
up the system this way to keep things honest.
Becoming a star
When you first join eBay, it seems like everyone on eBay has a star except
for you. It’s so unfair isn’t it? Well, not really. The stars of many colors are
awarded based on the amount of your feedback rating. When you receive a
feedback rating of 10, you get a bright new gold star (just like in school).

Understanding and Giving Feedback

You may notice stars of other colors — even shooting stars; Table 5-1 gives
you the lowdown on what each star color represents.

Once you have a star and you reach a higher level, I assure you that you will
get a silly tingly feeling of accomplishment. Very silly, yes, but it’s all part of
being a member of the eBay community.
Leaving feedback with finesse
Writing feedback well takes some practice. It isn’t a matter of saying things;
it’s a matter of saying only the appropriate things. Think carefully about what
you want to say because once you submit feedback, it stays with the person
for the duration of his or her eBay career. I think you should always leave
feedback, especially at the end of a transaction, although doing so isn’t
mandatory. Think of leaving feedback as voting in an election: If you don’t
leave feedback, you can’t complain about lousy service.
eBay says to make feedback “factual and emotionless.” You won’t go wrong
if you comment on the details (either good or bad) of the transaction. If you
have any questions about what eBay says about feedback, click the Services
link above the navigation bar and then click the eBay Feedback Forum link
under Member Reputation on the next page.
In the Feedback Forum, you can perform the following feedback-related
tasks:
✦Leave feedback: Here, you see all pending feedback for all transactions
within the past 90 days — the ones for which you haven’t left feedback.
Fill them in, one at a time. Then, with one click, you can leave as many
as 25 feedback comments at once.

Fetching feedback facts
How to get positive feedback
If you’re selling, here’s how to get a good 
reputation:
 Establish contact with the buyer (pronto!)
after the auction ends.
 After you’ve received payment, send out
the item quickly.
 Make sure that your item is exactly the way
you described it.
 Package the item well and ship it with care.
 React quickly and appropriately to 
problems — for example, the item’s lost or
damaged in the mail or the buyer is slow in
paying.
If you’re buying, try these good-rep tips:
 Send your payment fast.
 Keep in touch via e-mail with the seller.
 Work with the seller to resolve any prob-
lems in a courteous manner.
How to get negative feedback
If you’re selling, here’s what to do to tarnish
your name big time:
 Tell a major fib in the item description.
(Defend truth, justice, and legitimate cre-
ative writing — see Book III.)
 Take the money but “forget” to ship the
item.
 Package the item poorly so that it ends up
smashed, squashed, or vaporized during
shipping. (To avoid this pathetic fate, see
Book VII.)
If you’re buying, here’s how to make your status
a serious mess:
 Bid on an item, win the auction, and never
respond to the seller.
 Send a personal check that bounces and
never make good on the payment.
 Ask the seller for a refund because you just
don’t like the item.

In the real world (at least in the modern American version of it), anybody
can sue anybody else for slander or libel; this fact holds true on the Internet,
too. Be careful not to make any comments that could be libelous or slander-
ous. eBay is not responsible for your actions, so if you’re sued because of
negative feedback (or anything else you’ve written), you’re on your own. The
best way to keep yourself safe is to stick to the facts and don’t get personal.
If you’re angry, take a huge breather before you type your complaints and
click the Leave Comment button. If you’re convinced that negative feedback
is necessary, try a cooling-off period before you send comments. Wait an
hour or a day and then see whether you feel the same. Nasty feedback based
on emotion can make you look vindictive, even if what you’re saying is true.
Safety tips for giving feedback
And speaking of safety features you should know about feedback, you may
want to study up on these:
✦Remember that feedback, whether good or bad, is sticky. eBay won’t
remove your feedback comment if you change your mind later. Be sure
of your facts and carefully consider what you want to say.
✦Before you leave feedback, read what other people had to say about that
person. See whether what you’re thinking is in line with the comments
others have left.
✦Your feedback comment can be left as long as the transaction remains
on the eBay server. This is usually within 90 days of the end of the auc-
tion. After 90 days have passed, you must have the transaction number
to leave feedback.
✦Your comment can be a maximum of 80 letters, which is really short
when you have a lot to say. Before you start typing, organize your
thoughts and use common abbreviations to save precious space.
✦Before posting negative feedback, try to resolve the problem by e-mail
or telephone. You may discover that your reaction to the transaction is
based on a misunderstanding that can be easily resolved.
✦eBay users generally want to make each other happy, so use negative
feedback only as a last resort.

If you do leave a negative comment that you later regret, you can’t remove it.
You can go back to follow up and leave an explanation or a more positive
comment, but it won’t change the initial feedback or rating, so think twice
before you blast. If you write a nice e-mail to the other person in the transac-
tion and are able to solve a problem, you may file for mutual feedback
removal. See the “eBay will consider removing feedback if . . .” sidebar.
The ways to leave feedback
Several ways are available to leave feedback comments:
Mincing words: The at-a-glance guide 
to keeping feedback short
eBay likes to keep things simple. If you want to
compliment, complain, or take the middle road,
you have to do it in 80 characters or less. That
means your comment needs to be short and
sweet (or short and sour if it’s negative, or
sweet and sour if you’re mixing drinks or order-
ing Chinese food). If you have a lot to say but
you’re stumped about how to say it, here are a
few examples for any occasion. String them
together or mix and match!
Positive feedback:
 Very professional
 Quick e-mail response
 Fast service
 A+++
 Good communication
 Exactly as described
 Highly recommended
 Smooth transaction
 Would deal with again
 An asset to eBay
 I’ll be back!
Negative feedback:
 Never responded
 Never paid for item
 Check bounced, never made good
 Beware track record
 Item not as described
Neutral feedback:
 Slow to ship but item as described
 Item not as described but seller made good
 Paid w/MO (money order) after check
bounced
 Poor communication but item came OK

To leave feedback, follow these steps:
1. Enter the required information.
Note that your item number is usually filled in, but if you’re placing feed-

2. Choose whether you want your feedback to be positive, negative, or
neutral.
3. Type your feedback comment.
4. Click the Leave Feedback button.
You have the last word — responding to feedback
After reading feedback you’ve received from others, you may feel compelled
to respond. If the feedback is negative, you may want to defend yourself. If
it’s positive, you may want to say thank you.
Do not confuse responding to feedback with leaving feedback. Responding
does not change the other user’s feedback rating; it merely adds your
response below the feedback comment in your own feedback profile.
To respond to feedback, follow these steps:
1. In the Feedback section of your My eBay page, click the Go to

Scrutinizing a Seller’s Reputation
You’ve finally found an item you’d like to buy. Don’t place that bid just yet!
Studying the seller’s feedback will supply you with a good deal of informa-
tion about the reputation of your potential trading partner.
The more expensive your transaction, the more intense your investigation
may need to be. An unblemished feedback rating may not be as significant
on a $9 purchase as it is for a $200 purchase.
eBay will consider removing feedback if . . .
Only under certain, special circumstances will
eBay remove feedback:
 eBay is served with a court order stating
that the feedback in question is slanderous,
libelous, defamatory, or otherwise illegal.
eBay will also accept a settlement agree-
ment from a resolved lawsuit submitted by
both attorneys and signed by both parties.
 Negative feedback can be withdrawn by a
ruling by a certified arbitrator where both
parties agreed to submit the issue for bind-
ing arbitration. You can find this service on
Square Trade.
 The feedback in question has no relation to
eBay — such as comments about transac-
tions outside eBay or personal comments
about users.
 The feedback contains a link to another
page, picture, or JavaScript.
 The feedback is comprised of profane or
vulgar language.
 The feedback contains any personal iden-
tifying information about a user.
 The feedback refers to any investigation,
whether by eBay or a law-enforcement
organization.
 The feedback is left by a user who supplied
fraudulent information when registering on
eBay.
 The feedback is left by a person who can
be identified as a minor.
 The feedback is left by a user as 
harassment.
 The feedback is intended for another user,
when eBay has been informed of the situa-
tion and the same feedback has been left
for the appropriate user.
 Both parties shake hands and make up and
you apply to eBay for a Mutual Feedback
Removal.
If you are both able to resolve a problem after
feedback has been left, you can mutually agree
to withdraw the feedback from the feedback
record. Mutually withdrawn feedback still
appears in the member profile but is no longer
counted in the feedback score. To start a

I want you to be thoroughly educated in how the feedback system works. I’m
not trying to be bossy. I’m just saying that buyers and sellers (especially those
of us who have been using eBay for several years) take this stuff seriously.
If you’re just a dabbler, however, I can understand why you might want to
understand the light version of the eBay feedback system and save the high-
octane rendition of a feedback investigation for when you decide to buy that
yacht or the British crown jewels.
Conducting a “light” seller examination
As you look at the items for sale on eBay (both in auctions and in fixed-price
sales), you’ll notice that along with every auction listing you can find infor-
mation about the seller in eBay’s Seller Information box. Figure 5-1 shows
you four Seller Information boxes; notice the differences in their reputations.
The Seller Information box gives you a condensed version of the seller’s
feedback reputation. It always shows the seller’s ID and feedback rating,
including his or her star award level. (Check out Chapter 4 to get the low-
down on the Seller Information box.)
Consider a quick glance at the Seller Information box to be the light version
of a feedback investigation. A perfunctory glance at this box might be okay
if your purchase is for an item that’s worth a few dollars to you and if the
seller’s information box gives you a 99% to 100% positive feedback, as in the
Privacy in feedback may not be a good thing
I believe in the adage, “Keep your business 
private,” except when it refers to feedback. In
your eBay dealings, you may come upon a
seller with private or hidden feedback. Most
users show their comments, and eBay’s default
setting is for public viewing of feedback. This
way, everyone at eBay can read all about you.
If you want to make your feedback a private
matter, you need to go to the Feedback Forum
(click the Feedback Forum link on the bottom of
the eBay home page or from the Services link
above the navigation bar). On the resulting
page, click the Hide My Feedback link, and
reset it to Private.
Hiding your feedback comments is a bad idea.
You want people to know that you’re trustwor-
thy; being honest and upfront is the way to go.
If you hide your feedback, people may suspect
that you’re covering up bad things. It’s in your
best interest to let the spotlight shine on your
feedback history.
Your feedback is your reputation, your money,
and your experience as an eBay member. Keep
in mind that all three are always linked.

first two examples in Figure 5-1. However, if the Seller Information box looks
closer to the third or fourth example, and you’re looking at a pricier item, it’s
time for a more thorough analysis.
Even though the seller in the second example has a high overall feedback
rating, the percentage of positive comments is a little lower, and suggests
further examination.
Making a full-scale seller investigation
When you consider buying a more expensive item, be sure to click the seller’s
feedback number when you visit the auction item page. Clicking the number
will show you the member profile, shown in Figure 5-2.
After you click the feedback number, you should examine some important
details if you want to be a savvy, security-minded shopper.
Feedback summary
On the left side of the page you will see the feedback summary and on the
right, the seller’s member profile. Note the following significant entries:

✦Positive feedback comments: You may notice that the actual number of
positive comments is higher than the net positive figure. This is because
every eBay community member can comment only once on another
member and have it count in the feedback rating. The net rating is based
on comments from unique users.
For example, if you buy an item from me and we leave each other 
feedback (glowingly positive, I’m sure), and then next month I buy 
something from you, the feedback we leave on the second transaction
(again, glowingly positive) doesn’t count toward our total feedback
rating. However, the feedback does appear on the feedback summary
page. We can affect each other’s feedback rating by only 1.
✦Neutral comments: Neutral comments are usually left when a party
wasn’t thrilled with the transaction but nothing happened that was bad
enough to leave a dreaded, reputation-ruining negative comment. You
may also notice that some long-time eBay users have neutral comments
that were converted from users no longer registered.
For a very short while, eBay had a policy that when a member was 
suspended (yes, members do get suspended) or the member chose to
cancel his or her eBay membership, eBay turned all the feedback they
ever left or received (whether it was positive or negative) into neutral
feedback.
This policy didn’t last long because the eBay members put up such a
fuss that eBay listened and stopped the practice. Unfortunately, eBay
didn’t rescind the neutrals that had been put into place.
✦Negative comments: The number of negative comments may also
vary, just like the positives, because only one comment is allowed
per unique user.
Member profile
Also part of this comprehensive feedback page is the eBay member profile,
which carries historic information about the member: Think of your feed-
back profile as an eBay report card. Your goal is to get straight As — in this
case, all positive feedback. Unlike a real report card, you don’t have to bring
it home to be signed:
✦User ID: The eBay member’s nickname appears, followed by a number in
parentheses — the net number of the positive feedback comments the
person has received, minus any negative feedback comments.
✦Member links box: This area contains data and links. The important
piece of data is the date the person signed up as a member of the eBay
community. Below that are the links: the country from which the seller
is registered, links to the member’s eBay store (if the seller has one, of

course), his or her other auctions (where you can see whether the seller
is experienced in selling the type of item you’re looking to buy), his or
her ID history (where you can view the seller’s past user IDs, if any), and
the seller’s About Me page.
Check the seller’s About Me page
If you notice that the seller has a small Me icon
next to his or her user ID, click the icon to learn
more about the seller. Every eBay member may
have his or her own home page on eBay called
the About Me page (you can have one, too).
The About Me page is where members talk
about themselves, their businesses, and their
collections. For example, you can find my About
Me page at
http://members.ebay.com/about
me/marsha_c
I came across the About Me page in the figure
when I was looking at an auction for a Limoges
plate. This is a great example of how eBay
members show their personalities and build
trustworthy person-to-person (rather than
computer-to-computer) relationships with
other members of the eBay community.
If a new seller (without a lot of feedback)
smartly puts up an About Me page and talks
about his or her eBay goals and business, you
may feel more comfortable about doing busi-
ness with that person.

✦Contact member: Click the Contact Member button to view an e-mail
form allowing you to send an e-mail to the member through eBay’s
e-mail system.
✦Recent ratings: In a snapshot, you can see the seller’s recent eBay his-
tory for the past month, six months, and twelve months. This data is
useful because often the last couple of months’ transactions tell the tale.
If a previously reliable eBay seller has decided to join the Dark Side, here
is where the evidence will show up first. A number of new negative com-
ments from different buyers is a definite danger sign (even if the seller
has an overall high rating)!
If the last few transactions are negative in the recent reviews, think twice
about doing business with the seller, but that doesn’t mean you should
count the seller out completely. If the item is really a must-have, click
the ID of the person (or persons) who left the negative feedback and
ask politely for details so that you can make your own decisions. Sadly,
many buyers leave negative feedback for a seller before giving the seller
an opportunity to make things right, so by getting the details, you can
make your own decisions.
✦Bid retractions: A history of bidding on items and then changing one’s
mind is a signal more for sellers than for buyers. As a buyer, you may,
under certain circumstances, retract your bid (see Chapter 6). Each time
you retract your bid from an auction, the retraction shows up in this
area. Sellers often check this area to determine a bidder’s reliability.
Be careful when you retract a bid. All bids on eBay are binding, but under
what eBay calls exceptional circumstances, you may retract bids — sparingly.
Here are the circumstances in which it’s okay to retract a bid:
✦If you’ve mistakenly put in the wrong bid amount — say, $100 instead 
of $10
✦If the seller adds to his or her description after you’ve placed your bid,
and the change considerably affects the item
✦If you can’t authenticate the seller’s identity by reaching him or her by
phone or by e-mail
✦If a bid has been placed in your name by someone other than you
You can’t retract a bid just because you found the item elsewhere for less,
or you changed your mind, or you decided that you can’t afford the item.
Reading feedback reviews
Scrolling down the feedback history page, you’ll be able to read the actual
reviews left by other eBay members. In Figure 5-3, you’ll see a sample of my
current feedback. You see each the member’s user ID, along with his or her
feedback rating and comment.

By default, you see the All Feedback Received tab. You may use the other
tabs at the top of the page to sort the comments as follows:
✦From Buyers: These are comments from people who bought something
from this seller.
✦From Sellers: When you buy and play by the rules, you get some posi-
tive feedback.
✦Left for Others: Checking the type of feedback someone leaves about
others can give you an insight into his or her personality. When consid-
ering making a big purchase, I always check this area; it helps me know
the type of person I’m dealing with. When you read feedback that makes
nasty slams at the other person, or if the person uses rude words or
phrases when leaving feedback, it’s a clue that you may be dealing with
a loose cannon.
Here’s what else you see:
✦The date the feedback was left, along with the transaction number. If the
transaction is 90 days old or less, the transaction number is a clickable
link to the transaction.
✦Seller or Buyer on the right side of each comment. Seller means that the
feedback was left by the seller in the transaction, and Buyer means it
was left by a buyer.

Comparing Items Before Buying
90
Many independent eBay sellers are experienced buyers as well as sellers —
they have an excellent grasp of how eBay feels from a customer’s point of
view and know how to handle any of your concerns.
Here are some tips for assessing feedback, depending on the situation:
✦When buying from a seller who sells the same item repeatedly, use the
clickable links to past transactions to see whether other buyers of the
same item were pleased with their purchases.
✦When you come across neutral or negative feedback, look for the seller’s
response. A seller or a buyer may respond to the feedback by clicking
the Reply to feedback received link at the bottom of the feedback page.
✦The feedback system relies on the expectation that members give
each other the benefit of the doubt. When you come across negative
(or neutral) feedback about a seller, look for the seller’s response and
see whether the problem was resolved before making your final judg-
ment. You may even see a follow-up feedback comment from the buyer
saying that everything has been settled.
On eBay, feedback can’t be removed unless both parties go through media-
tion or the mutual feedback removal process (see Chapter 6).
Comparing Items Before Buying
Using the Compare Items feature on eBay, you can isolate and compare 
several items from a search. You can use this feature when you search
eBay auctions or eBay stores.
By using Compare Items, you can decide head to head which is the best
deal. In Figure 5-4, I performed a search for the Poodle Hat CD from Weird
Al Yankovic. (This CD features his famous “eBay Song,” a parody of the
Backstreet Boy’s version of “I Want It That Way.” It’s hysterical!) I searched
eBay auctions and didn’t find much, so I searched eBay stores.
After I have my items, I click to place a check mark next to each one I’m inter-
ested in and then click the Compare button. Figure 5-5 shows the results.
From here I can see snapshots of the items and can check the following:
✦Item title: A clickable link to the listing and a link to watch this item.
✦Price: The current bid or the Buy It Now price.
✦Seller information: The seller’s user ID, clickable feedback rating, feed-
back percentage, and icons. You also see whether the seller has an eBay
store, has an About Me page, and is an eBay PowerSeller.

✦Shipping cost: The seller’s shipping cost is posted for comparison, pro-
vided the seller input the flat shipping fee when the item was posted for
auction or sale. If you don’t see a shipping cost, you have to click the
title to read the description.
✦Shipping location: Again, if the seller included a location, you’ll get an
idea how close the seller is to you. If not, you will just see the country in
which the seller is registered on eBay.
✦Payment information: You’ll be able to tell at a glance what forms of
payment the seller accepts, and most importantly, if your purchase will
be protected by the PayPal buyer protection program (symbolized by
the PayPal PP logo next to a small blue shield).
From here, you can delete listings from your comparison and decide which
listings you want to investigate further. Click the item link to visit the listing
before you decide to bid or buy.
Getting Protection on eBay
One thing’s for sure in this world: Nothing is for sure. That’s why insurance
and bonding companies exist. Several forms of protection are available for

eBay fraud protection
To cover loss from fraud, eBay has its own fraud protection program. It covers
money that you paid for an item you never received (as a result of fraud, not
shipping problems) or received but find to be materially different from the
auction item’s description.

Book I
Chapter 5

eBay fraud protection pays up to $175 — a maximum of $200 coverage
minus a $25 deductible — for a single claim. So if you file a $50 claim, you
get $25. If you file a $5000 claim, you still get only $175. (Hey, it’s better than
nothing — but I hope that if you’re going to spend that kind of scratch on
eBay you protect yourself by dealing with a PayPal and a BuySAFE-bonded
or SquareTrade-verified seller.)
The fraud protection program provided by eBay also covers the cost of pur-
chase for an item that never makes it to your door. This coverage is doled
out only if the package doesn’t arrive because of a fraudulent transaction —
it doesn’t cover shipping errors or other mishaps.
Here’s the checklist for qualifying for an eBay fraud protection payment:
✦The buyer and seller must be in good standing (no negative feedback
ratings).
✦The buyer must have proof that the item cost more than $25.
✦The buyer must prove that payment was sent.
✦The buyer must prove that the seller didn’t send the item or that the
item sent is substantially different from the auction description.
To be eligible, you must register a complaint with the fraud reporting system
no sooner than 30 days (and no later than 60 days) after the auction closes.
eBay then e-mails the seller to let the seller know that a complaint has been
lodged. eBay hopes that by the time the 60 days are up, the differences are
resolved and you can withdraw your complaint. In the unlikely event that
you need to file a fraud alert, here’s the link:
http://crs.ebay.com/aw-cgi/ebayisapi.dll?crsstartpage
After you file the alert, eBay e-mails you a link to the final online protection
claim form. You fill it out, return it to eBay, and should have results in a maxi-
mum of 90 days.
eBay Motors limited warranty
A beneficial eBay venture is its teaming up with Aon Warranty to offer a free
limited warranty (1 month/1000 miles) to anyone who purchases a car on
eBay. To qualify (this is the easy part), the car you purchase must be under 
nine model years old, have fewer than 125,000 miles on it, and have no mechan-
ical modifications. Qualified cars are identified in the listing description
in the Item Specifics box, with the words Free 1 Month, 1,000 Mile Service
Agreement.

The warranty covers up to $10,000 in repairs with a $500 deductible per
visit. You must activate the warranty during the checkout process. More
information can be found at eBay Motors:
pages.motors.ebay.com/services/warranty.html
eBay Motors vehicle purchase protection
Because eBay buyer protection only covers you up to $175, you’re kinda out of
luck when it comes to buying a car, not! Vehicle purchase protection protects
buyers against the few cases of fraud and material vehicle misrepresentation
that do occur. Coverage maximum is the vehicle purchase price, up to $20,000,
with a $100 buyer deductible. This program is provided free to buyers on all
eligible eBay Motors passenger vehicle transactions.
To view all the current details, go to
pages.motors.ebay.com/services/purchase-protection.html
PayPal buyer protection
Aside from safety, PayPal offers an even better reason to pay through their
service. If you’ve purchased your item through a PayPal-verified seller, you
may be covered for your purchase up to $1000. Combined with the eBay
insurance, that brings your total coverage to $1200!
This protection covers you only for nondelivery of tangible items and tangi-
ble items that are received but are significantly not as described — it does
not cover items that you are disappointed with. The PayPal protection kicks
in after you have filed for the eBay fraud protection and your item exceeds
the $200 cap.
If you’ve paid with a credit card through PayPal, be sure to make a claim
with eBay first and then with PayPal. Do not make a claim with your credit
card company. PayPal protection is for PayPal purchases and you are not
covered if you’ve made a claim with your credit card company.

Several types of protection are available to eBay buyers, as shown in 
Table 5-2.

Table 5-2
eBay Shopper’s Assurance
Type of Insurance
Who Pays
Explanation
Shipping insurance
Buyer
As the buyer, you must pay the seller the additional
charge for package insurance. This will cover your
purchase up to the insured amount while in transit
through the post office, UPS, or FedEx.
eBay buyer protection
No charge
Buyer is automatically covered up to $200 (with a
$25 deductible) when a purchase is made on eBay
from an eBay seller.
PayPal buyer 
No charge
If eBay agrees that you’ve been defrauded and 
protection program
you’ve paid for your purchase through PayPal to a
PayPal-verified seller, you may be covered for up to
an additional $1000.
BuySAFE bond
Seller
BuySAFE bonds the seller’s performance through
The Hartford on the item up to $10,000.
SquareTrade buyer 
Seller
SquareTrade will pay up to $550 in insurance (above 
protection policy
and beyond any other coverage you may have) if
you’ve been defrauded by a SquareTrade seal
member.
BuySAFE bond
BuySAFE helps make online auctions safer. The BuySAFE with the Hartford
program offers one of the highest levels of protection available to online auc-
tion participants. It is the only program that enables sellers to present a
credibility seal and financially protect their online auction transactions with
surety bonds.
BuySAFE comprehensively qualifies sellers to display the BuySAFE seal.
When a buyer sees the BuySAFE seal on an auction or fixed-price listing,
the transaction is 100% guaranteed to be exactly as listed.
SquareTrade buyer protection
SquareTrade has a buyer protection program that provides fraud coverage
in addition to the coverage provided by eBay and PayPal. That means 
the entire group of programs may protect you, if you meet the eligibility
guidelines.
Your coverage depends on the level of coverage each SquareTrade seal
member applies for within his or her membership; the max is $550.
One caveat: It’s unlikely that a SquareTrade seal holder is going to defraud
you. SquareTrade checks sellers’ feedback and reports on a daily basis to be
sure they’re playing within the eBay rules. SquareTrade yanks back its seal
of approval if anything fishy is going on.

Verified Rights Owner program
eBay is a venue. It is a place where sellers sell their wares to smart shoppers
like you. No one at eBay owns the items, and no one at eBay can guarantee
that items are as described in auction listings. That means you could, theo-
retically, buy a “genuine” Kate Spade purse on eBay for $24, and immediately
realize when it arrives that the purse is counterfeit. But it’s not eBay’s fault.
(Shame on you for thinking you could get that kind of deal on a new Kate
Spade purse — but if you can, e-mail me and let me know where.)
Just because eBay doesn’t take the blame for its fraudulent sellers’ handi-
work doesn’t mean that eBay doesn’t care if you get duped. Their VeRO
(Verified Rights Owner) program connects eBay with companies or persons
that care to protect their intellectual property rights (such as a copyright,
trademark, or patent), which could possibly be infringed by an eBay listing.
VeRO members send proof to eBay that they own the specified intellectual
property. In return, they can report infringements to eBay and eBay’s listing
police will end the counterfeit listings. This is not an automatic service,
and the property owners are responsible to find their own infringements
on the site.
Many VeRO members have their own About Me pages. To see a list of links to
these pages, go to the following:

 Placing bids
 Timing your bid
 Bidding strategies you don’t want to miss
 Becoming an expert at sniping!
 Retracting a bid in an emergency
A
few years ago, on the day after Christmas, I was on The Today Show
with Matt Lauer talking about after holiday bargains on eBay. This
wasn’t the first time I’d been on the show with him; but this time Matt
seemed very interested in getting a deal on a child’s lamp that I happened to
be selling. He and his wife had just had a baby, and everyone likes a bargain.
If everyone likes a bargain, then I’m not like everyone because I love bar-
gains! When I was teaching classes at eBay’s own eBay University (yes, there
really is one), my favorite class to teach was Buying and Browsing, because I
love the thrill of the chase and the acquisition of a good deal without all the
haggling.
Often, the first thing that people ask me is how they can stop getting outbid
at the last minute of an auction. I always say the same thing — become an
expert sniper and bid higher than the other guy!
Okay, but how? In this chapter I give you my tips and a few I picked up from
other wise shoppers along the way.
eBay treats every bid, other than bids on some real estate sales or incor-
rectly placed bids, as binding. If you win an auction and do not go through
with your commitment by purchasing the item, the seller will file an Unpaid
Item (UPI) notice on you. If you establish a history as a nonpaying bidder
with eBay (that is, you repeatedly back out of sales), you have a strong
chance of getting suspended from the community.
How much an item sells for depends on how many people see the item and
how badly other bidders want it. You may think of the retail price or book
value as a standard for pricing, but neither may be accurate when it comes
to shopping on eBay. In fact, I say everything has three prices:

Understanding the Bidding Action
98
✦The price a retailer charges for an item at the store
✦The price everyone says something is worth
✦The price an item actually sells for on eBay
Understanding the Bidding Action
Okay, you’ve found the perfect item to track (say a really classy Elvis Presley
wristwatch), and it’s in your price range. You’re more than interested — you’re
ready to bid. If this were a live auction, some stodgy looking guy in a gray
suit would see you nod your head and start the bidding at, say, $2. Then some
woman with a severe hairdo would yank on her ear, and the Elvis watch would
jump to $3.
eBay reality is more like this: You’re sitting at home in your fuzzy slippers,
sipping coffee in front of the computer. All the other bidders are cruising
cyberspace in their pajamas, too, but you can’t see ’em. (Be real thankful for
little favors.)
When you’re ready to jump into the eBay fray, find the bidding form (shown
in Figure 6-1) at the bottom of the auction item page or click the Place Bid
button at the top of the auction page. If the item includes a Buy It Now option,
you see that next to the bid form.
Placing your bid
To fill out the bidding form and place a bid, first make sure that you’re regis-
tered. (For help in registering, see Chapter 3.) After you make your first bid
on an item, you can instantly get to auctions you’re bidding on from your My
eBay page. Follow these steps to place a bid:

Understanding the Bidding Action

1. Enter your maximum bid in the appropriate box.
The bid needs to be higher than the current minimum bid.
2. If this is a multiple-item auction, enter the quantity of items that
you’re bidding on.
(If it’s not a multiple-item auction, the quantity is always 1.) Figure 6-2
shows a multiple-item auction bidding form.
You don’t need to put in the dollar sign, but you do need to use a deci-
mal point — unless you really want to pay $1049.00 instead of $10.49.
If you make a mistake with an incorrect decimal point, you can retract
your bid (see “Retracting Your Bid in an Emergency,” at the end of this
chapter).
3. Click Review Bid.
The Review Bid page appears on your screen, filling it with a wealth of
legalese. This is your last chance to change your mind: Do you really
want the item, and can you really buy it? The bottom line is this: If you
bid on it and you win, you buy it.
4. Sign in if you haven’t already.
5. If you agree to the terms, click Continue.
After you agree, the Bid Confirmation screen appears.
eBay’s computer sends you an e-mail confirming your bid, if you’ve indicated
that you want confirmation e-mails. However, eBay’s mail server can be as
slow as a tree-sloth marathon (yours would be too if you had a few million
auctions to track), so don’t rely on eBay to keep track of your auctions. After
all, this is your money at stake.

Understanding the Bidding Action

eBay considers a bid on an item to be a binding contract. You can save your-
self a lot of heartache if you promise to never bid on an item you don’t intend
to buy. Don’t make spurious bids, assuming that because you’re new to eBay,
you can’t win; if you do that, you’ll probably win simply because you’ve left
yourself open to Murphy’s Law. Therefore, before you go to the bidding
form, be sure that you’re in this auction for the long haul and make yourself
another promise to figure out the maximum you’re willing to spend — and
stick to it.
If you want to practice bidding, go to eBay’s Test Bid page at
http://pages.ebay.com/education/tutorial/course1/bidding/
index.html
Bidding to the max with automatic (proxy) bidding
When you make a maximum bid on the bidding form, you actually make sev-
eral small bids — again and again — until the bidding reaches where you
told it to stop. For example, if the current bid is up to $19.99 and you put in a
maximum of $45.02, your bid automatically increases incrementally so that
you’re ahead of the competition — at least until someone else’s maximum
bid exceeds yours. Basically, you bid by proxy, which means that your bid
rises incrementally in response to other bidders’ bids.
No one else knows for sure whether you’re bidding automatically, and no
one knows how high your maximum bid is. And the best part is that you 
can be out having a life of your own while the proxy bidding happens 
automatically.
The bid increment is the amount of money by which a bid is raised, and
eBay’s system can work in mysterious ways. Buyers and sellers have no con-
trol over the bid increments that eBay sets. The current maximum bid can
jump up a nickel or a quarter or even an Andrew Jackson, but there is a
method to the madness, even though you may not think so. To determine
how much to increase the bid increment, eBay uses a bid-increment formula
that’s based on the current high bid. For example:
✦A 5-quart bottle of cold cream has a current high bid of $14.95. The bid
increment is $0.50 — meaning that if you bid by proxy, your automatic
bid will be $15.45.
✦A 5-ounce can of top-notch caviar has a high bid of $200. The bid incre-
ment is $2.50. If you choose to bid by proxy, your bid will be $202.50.
Table 6-1 shows you what kind of magic happens when you put the proxy
system and a bid-increment formula together in the same cyber-room.

The Secret’s in the Timing
A bricks-and-mortar auction, such as those held by Sotheby’s or Christie’s,
ends when the bidding ends. No auctioneer is going to cut off the feverish
bidding for that one-of-a-kind Van Gogh, right? As long as someone is bid-
ding, all systems are go. The last bidder standing wins. Auctions on eBay,
however, close at a prescribed time. Because of this fundamental difference
in the way eBay runs its auctions, you need to do some special work to make
sure that you can make the most strategically timed bid possible.
You can find out what time an auction ends by simply looking at the auction
page. Note that eBay runs on Pacific time and uses a 24-hour clock (00:00 to
24:00 versus the more familiar 1:00 to 12:00).

The Secret’s in the Timing
102
To get the serious deals, you need to synchronize your computer’s clock
with eBay’s. To find out what eBay’s official time is, go to
http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?TimeShow
Then compare eBay’s time with your computer’s clock. On most Windows-
based computers, the time is in the lower-right corner of the screen on the
taskbar.
To change the time on your computer’s clock, follow these steps:
1. Open your Internet browser and visit the following:
http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?TimeShow
The official clock at the eBay mothership appears, in the form of the
Official Time page. Keep the browser open.
2. Right-click your computer’s taskbar and choose Adjust Date/Time.
The Date/Time Properties window appears.
3. Click the Internet browser to activate it, and then click the browser’s
Refresh button.
4. After the page refreshes, immediately type the official eBay time into
your computer’s clock, and then click OK.
If your computer is running the Windows XP operating system, the box that
appears when you right-click the taskbar has a third option, Internet Time.
In this window (see Figure 6-3) you can synchronize your computer’s clock
to the Microsoft time server or the National Institute of Standards and
Technology’s atomic clock.

Using the lounging-around strategy
Sometimes the best strategy at the beginning of an auction is to do nothing
at all. That’s right; relax, take off your shoes, and loaf. You may want to make
a token bid (the very lowest you are allowed) or mark the page to watch in
your My eBay area. I generally take this attitude through the first six days of
a week-long auction I want to bid on, and it works pretty well. I do, however,
check in every day to keep tabs on the items I’m watching on the My eBay
page, and I revise my strategy as time goes by.
Going, going, gone
Although many people list their auctions to end
at all hours of the day and night, the amount of
bidders in cyberspace is higher during certain
hours. Between the hours of 23:00 (that’s 11:00
p.m. Pacific standard time) and 03:00 (that’s 3:00
a.m. Pacific standard time), things run a bit
slowly on eBay. If you’re online at that time, 
you may be able to take advantage of some
very serious bargains. So swallow a shot of
espresso and have fun if you’re a night owl.
Going, going, gone is the name of the game my
daughter and I used to play when we wanted
to go shopping for fun on eBay. Visit your
favorite eBay category and have fun.
You can choose to view the auctions that are
going to end in the next few hours by using the
Search Options on the left side of the page.
Here you can cruise the auction closing while
the world is asleep, and bid to your heart’s con-
tent to get some great bargains.

The Secret’s in the Timing
104
The seller has the right to up the minimum bid — if the auction has received
no bids — up to 12 hours before the auction ends. If the seller has set a
ridiculously low minimum bid and then sees that the auction is getting no
action, the seller may choose to up the minimum bid to protect his or her
sale. By placing the minimum token bid when you first see the auction, you
can foil a Buy It Now from another bidder (because Buy It Now is disabled
after a bid is in place) or prevent the seller from upping the minimum.
If you see an item that you absolutely must have, mark it to watch on your
My eBay page (or make a token bid) and revise your maximum bid as the
auction goes on. I can’t stress enough how important this is.
As you check back each day, take a look at the other bids and the high bidder.
Is someone starting a bidding war? Look at the time when the competition is
bidding and note patterns, such as lunchtime bidding. If you know what time
your major competition is bidding, you can bid after he or she does (prefer-
ably when your foe is stuck in rush-hour traffic).
Using the beat-the-clock strategy
You should rev up your bidding strategy during the final 24 hours of an auc-
tion and decide, once and for all, whether you really have to have the item
you’ve been eyeing. Maybe you put in a maximum bid of $45.02 earlier in the
week. Now’s the time to decide whether you’re willing to go as high as $50.02.
Maybe $56.03?
No one wants to spend the day in front of the computer (ask almost anyone
who does). Just place a sticky note where you’re likely to see it, reminding
you of the exact time the auction ends. If you’re not going to be near a 
computer when the auction closes, you can also use an automatic bidding
software program to bid for you; see “Succeeding by Sniping,” later in this
chapter, for details.
In the last few minutes
With a half hour left before the auction becomes ancient history, head for
the computer and dig in for the last battle of the bidding war. I recommend
that you log on to eBay about 10 to 15 minutes before the auction ends. The
last thing you want is to get caught in Internet gridlock and not get access 
to the eBay Web site. Go to the items you’re watching and click the auction
title.
With 10 minutes to go, if there’s a lot of action on your auction, click reload
or refresh every 30 seconds to get the most current info on how many people
are bidding.

Shopping the Machiavellian Way
105
Shopping the Machiavellian Way
When you’ve shopped eBay for a while, you will know the user IDs of many
of the people you bid against in auctions. Don’t be surprised that other
people in the eBay universe have the same quirky interests as you. You may
even come to dislike them if they outbid you often enough. It’s a wretched
feeling, being outbid, especially when it happens at the last minute.
The user ID of the person the item would belong to if the auction ended right
now is listed on the auction item page (assuming someone has bid on the
item). Take a look at this name because you may see it again in auctions for
similar items. If the high bidder has lots of feedback, he or she may know the
ropes — and be back to fight if you up the ante.
I remember once hearing a comedy routine about how much quicker it is to
shop in a supermarket from other people’s carts rather than running from
aisle to aisle — and eBay is no different. When you get to know the IDs of
your bidding competitors, you can run bidder searches on them.
For example, say meanguy123 outbids you in an auction for rare antique
glockenspiels. You can run a bidder search on the old meany and find out
what else he has been bidding on lately — and how much he bids.
You can find out the following information when you run a bidder search:
✦The items the bidder tends to be interested in: Might as well let your
competition do the legwork of finding good auctions for the items you
like.
✦What time of day the bidder likes to make bids: You can get a sense of
whether the bidder is in another part of the country (or the world) and
use the time difference to your advantage.
✦Other bidding habits: Some bidders like to place an initial bid at the
beginning of the auction and then swoop in at the end and snipe. Or they
never bid until the end of the auction. Or they never snipe. No matter
what strategy your competition chooses, you can come up with a counter
strategy to improve your likelihood of winning.
✦How high the bidder tends to like to bid: This is a key to enable you to
win the auction by as few pennies as possible. Does the bidder end with
.27? End yours with .32. Also, if the bidder is accumulating items one at a
time, you really have a good picture of exactly how much he or she will
bid. Information is power!

Shopping the Machiavellian Way
106
Bidding in odd increments is just one of the many strategies to get you
ahead of the rest of the bidding pack without paying more than you should.
Note: Many of the strategies in this chapter are for bidders who are tracking
an item over the course of a week or more, so be sure you have time to track
the item and plan your next move. Also, get a few auctions under your belt
before you throw yourself into the middle of a bidding war.
Investigating the opposing bidder is not snooping! It’s totally legal and
acceptable. (Okay, maybe it’s a little sneaky.) When you’ve checked out your
competition’s shopping cart, you can swoop in and bid or snipe back if you
like the other items this bidder is interested in. Isn’t it easier to let someone
else do the legwork and find the bargains for you?
You can run a bidder search by doing the following:
1. Click the Advanced Search link, which appears in the top-right corner
of almost every eBay page.
2. In the Search links area on the left, click the Items by Bidder link.
3. Enter the user ID of the bidder you want to check out.
4. To check the bidder’s previous auctions, click to add a check mark in
the Include Completed Listings box (see Figure 6-4).
By studying the past bidding history, you can see how high the bidder is
willing to bid on certain items. This is invaluable information if you want
to get a drift of how high you have to bid to win the next auction.
5. Tell eBay whether you also want to see the person’s bid even if he or
she is not the high bidder.
Selecting the Even If Not the High Bidder option means that you want to
see the bidder’s activity in every auction, even if the person is not the
current high bidder. I think you should check all the bidder’s auctions
to see how aggressively he or she bids on items. You can also see how
badly a bidder wants specific items.
Put in your two cents
Your two cents does matter — at least on eBay.
Here’s why: Many eBay members round off
their bids to the nearest dollar figure or choose
familiar coin increments such as 25, 50, or 75
cents. But the most successful eBay bidders
have found that adding 2 or 3 cents to a routine
bid can mean the difference between winning
and losing. So I recommend that you make your
bids in odd amounts, like $15.02 or $45.57, as an
inexpensive way to edge out your competition.
For the first time ever, your two cents may actu-
ally pay off!

If the bidder was bidding on an item in the past that you’re both inter-
ested in now, you can get a fairly good idea of how high that person is
willing to go for the item this time.
6. Choose the number of items you want to see per page.
7. Click the Search button.
You may find that relying on the bidder search can give you a false sense of
knowledge and confidence. Others may use the bidder search to become
familiar with your habits, too. And many savvy buyers have two eBay user
IDs and alternate to confuse those who try to follow their bidding patterns.
Sniping can also help because no one will know you’re interested in the auc-
tion until you win the item. Mix your bidding patterns up a bit to keep the
competition wondering!
I keep links in my browser to bidder searches from some of my favorite bid-
ders. When I’m in the mood to shop, I just look at what they’re bidding on.
My favorite bidding strategies
There used to be a time when I would tell beginning eBay members my
favorite methods of bidding and winning, and if there was an eBay employee
in earshot, you could see him or her wince. Things are considerably different
these days. For example, eBay used to officially oppose the use of third-
party payment options — until they purchased PayPal. And when sniping
swept the online auction community and became de riguer, the eBay Powers
That Be didn’t endorse the practice. Finally, after some agonizing, the eBay
insiders admitted that sniping does work in winning auctions.

As a matter of fact, eBay’s instructors are now pitching many of the strategies
that I’ve been talking about for years — because they work! While editing this
book, my editor even reminisced about just how much the eBay “party line”
has changed since I wrote my first book on eBay in 1999.
Hunting for errors
Some of my best buys on eBay were the result of searching for misspellings.
Many sellers are in a hurry when they set up their auction listings, and to err
is human (and to win, divine). I am more than willing to forgive sellers for
their mistakes because the payoff for bargain hunters is, well, a bargain.
Think of alternate spellings when you search for an item. A favorite of mine
is Von Furstenburg for Von Furstenberg. Usually, I search for the correct
spelling and find a bunch of items where the bidding can get steep. But when
I search for the misspelled version, I may find identical items that have no
bids, because I’m the only one who has found the listing.
You can search for both the correct and incorrect spellings by using a search
such as (furstenberg,furstenburg). Book II gives you lots more search tricks.
I was also successful during the holiday season of 2002, when those com-
puter animated cats were popular (and going for extremely high prices on
eBay, because they were sold out everywhere across the country). The brand
name was FurReal. I searched for spellings like fur real and furreal and found
many bargains.
Use asterisks as a wildcard in your search, especially if you’re not sure of the
spelling of a word. You can also find some nuggets when searching for the
plural of an item. (Check out Book II, Chapter 1.)
Researching your item
Sometimes we (that’s me and you) find what we think is an incredible deal
on eBay. It may well be, especially if we know that the retail price is, say, $80
and we’re seeing a Buy It Now or an auction closing at $40. If a low, low price
works for you, just go ahead and buy the item if you want it right away. To
find the best price for any item on eBay, do your homework to find out what
similar items on eBay tend to sell for.
When you conduct your eBay research, the best strategy is to look at the
prices achieved in previous sales. Do a search for completed auctions. Then
check an auction’s bid history by clicking the Bid History link on the auction
item page (the link appears next to the number of bids). You’ll be presented
with the screen like the one in Figure 6-5. This will give you an idea of how
many people are duking it out for the item.

Chapter 6

Pay attention to the times when bidders are placing their bids, and you may
find that the people bidding in the auction are creatures of habit — making
their bids about once a day and at a particular time of day. They may be log-
ging on before work, during lunch, or after work. Whatever their schedules,
you have great info at your disposal in the event that a bidding war breaks
out: Just bid after your competition traditionally logs out, and you increase
your odds of winning the auction.
Early in an auction, there may not be much of a bidding history for an item,
but that doesn’t mean you can’t still check out the dates and times a bidder
places bids. You can also tell whether a bidder practices sniping (discussed
later in this chapter) if his or her bid is in the last few seconds of the auc-
tion. You may have a fight on your hands if the bidder uses sniping.
Multiple-item (Dutch) auction strategy
Multiple-item (Dutch) auctions are funky. (Yes, funky is a technical term.)
Each winner pays the same amount for the item, and multiple-item auctions
don’t have a supersecret reserve price. But winning a multiple-item auction
isn’t all that different from winning other auctions. Therefore, wait until the
closing minutes of the auction to bid and then follow my sage advice for
optimum success.
Here are the key things to remember about a multiple-item auction:
✦The seller must sell all the items at the lowest winning price at the
end of the auction, no matter what.
✦Winners are based on the highest bids received. If you up the ante,
you could win the auction and pay only the lowest winning price, which
may be lower than your bid. Confused yet? Say the minimum bid for
each of ten Elvis watches is $10 and 20 people bid at $10, each person
Figure 6-5:

history lets
you know
what time

Shopping the Machiavellian Way

bidding for one watch. The first ten bidders win the watch. But suppose
you come along at the end of the auction and bid $15 as the 21st bidder.
You get a watch (as do the first nine people who bid $10), and you get
the watch for the lowest successful bid — which is $10! Get it?
✦Know where you stand in the pecking order. You can see a list of high
bidders (and their bids) on the auction page, so you always know where
you stand in the pecking order.
✦Avoid being the lowest or the highest high bidder. The highest bidder
is sure to win, so the usual bidding strategy is to knock out the lowest
high bidder. The lowest high bidder is said to be on the bubble and on
the verge of losing the auction by a couple of pennies. To avoid being
the bidder on the bubble, keep your bid just above the second-lowest
winning bid.
✦If you want to buy more than one of an item up for auction, make sure
you have that number of successful high bids as the auction draws to
a close. Huh? Remember, winners are based on the highest bids. If you’re
in a multiple-item auction for ten items and place five $15 bids, nothing
guarantees that you’ll win five of the item. Nine other people who want
the item could bid $20 apiece. Then they each win one of the items at
$15, and you end up with only one of the item. (At least you still pay 
only $15 for it.)
Quick bidding tips
When you get a tip, double-check who it’s coming from. Visit eBay’s commu-
nity boards and chats, and listen to what the others have to say. Before taking
anything to heart and changing the way you do things, check the tip-givers’
experiences. Are they really experienced on eBay? Or are they just touting
the current company line or passing on the latest misinformation? I love
buying from eBay sellers who are also buyers, because they respect and
understand what it’s like to be a buyer on eBay!
Here are a few short tips that I know really work:
✦Shop eBay.ca, eh! That’s right. If you’re in the U.S., why not bid on auc-
tions on the eBay Canada Web site? In fact, if you’re an international
bidder and are willing to pay shipping from the U.S., you’ll have no 
problem handling Canadian shipping charges.
If you’re an American resident, all you have to do is think about the conver-
sion between the U.S. and Canadian dollars — oh yes, there are bargains
to be had. From the eBay home page, scroll down the left side of the page
and click the Canada link. Or you can visit www.eBay.ca. Be sure the seller
has reasonable shipping to the United States before you bid.

Book I
Chapter 6
Bidding to Win
Shopping the Machiavellian Way
111
✦Place your bids in odd figures. Many eBay bidders place their bids in
the round numbers that match eBay’s proxy system. You can win by a
few cents if you place your bids in odd numbers like $10.97 or $103.01.
✦Don’t get carried away in a bidding war. Unless the item is rare, odds
are that a similar item will show up on eBay again someday soon. Don’t
let your ego get in the way of smart bidding. Let your opposition pay
too much!
✦Don’t freak out if you find yourself in a bidding war. Don’t keel over if,
at the split second you’re convinced that you’re the high bidder with
your $45.02, someone beats you out at $45.50.
✦Watch for item relistings. If you see an item that you want but it has too
high an opening bid (or too high a reserve), there’s a good chance that
no one else will bid on the item either. Put that auction into your Watch
area of My eBay. Then after the auction ends, every so often double-
check the seller’s auctions to see whether the item has been relisted
with a lower starting bid and a lower (or no) reserve.
✦Combine shipping when possible. When you purchase an item, check
the seller’s other auctions and see whether you’re interested in making a
second purchase. If you see something else that appeals to you, e-mail
the seller to see whether he or she will combine the items in shipping.
That way, you can make two purchases for a smaller single shipping bill.
✦Never bid early, but if you do, bid high. The only time this bidding
early business works is if no one else is interested in the auction.
Usually, though, the tactic will gear up another eBay user to outbid you
because suddenly the item is valuable to at least one person. If you must
bid before the auction’s close, bid high. As a matter of fact, bid a couple
of dollars more than you might want to pay. (I mean literally a couple,
not a couple hundred.)
✦Try for a Second Chance offer: If you get outbid and miss the chance to
increase your bid on an auction item, you’d be smart to e-mail the seller
and ask whether he or she has any more. You may get lucky, and the
seller can send you a Second Chance offer for your high bid.
A seller may send a Second Chance offer to underbidders in their auc-
tion under three circumstances: when the winner doesn’t go through
with the winning bid, when the reserve price wasn’t met, or when the
seller has more than one of the item that was sold. Any purchase you
make in this manner will be covered under eBay’s insurance, and you
will have the opportunity to leave feedback.
Bidder’s research software
Research software can help you dig deep into a seller’s feedback or check
out a competitive bidder. Most software out there is for sellers, but a few
programs are strictly for buyers: If you plan on spending any serious money
on eBay, using feedback evaluation software might be worth the cost.

112
✦BayCheck Pro: With this software, you can find out about another eBay
user’s selling and bidding history, feedback received (isolating the neutrals
and negatives to read without going through all the seller’s feedback), and
feedback left for others. For a special free trial and a discount price of
$14.99 for the software, go to

✦Safe2Bid: This simple little program explores the feedback of any partic-
ular eBay user. It also separates the negatives and neutrals and works
the percentages for you. More information is available at
www.cricketsniper.com
✦GutCheck Software: This free software was developed as a service to
the eBay buying and selling community. It allows anyone to get a quick
analysis of an eBay member’s feedback. GutCheck is a small download
that resides in Internet Explorer and is available from a pop-up menu
(which you call up by right-clicking in any Internet Explorer window).

Succeeding by Sniping
Sniping is the fine art of outbidding your competition in the very last seconds
of the auction — without leaving them enough time to place a defensive bid.
Sniping is my number one favorite way to win an auction on eBay. When I
first touted this method in 1999, it was a fairly new idea. Now everyone
knows about sniping, and it’s pretty much an accepted bidding method.
Bidders (that is, losing bidders) whine and moan when they lose to a sniper,
but they should remember one thing: The high bidder always wins, whether
you’re sniping or using the automatic bid system. If you’re going to snipe,
assume that the current bidder has a very high dollar proxy bid in the works.
Some eBay members consider the practice of sniping unseemly and 
uncivilized — like when dozens of parents used to mob the department 
store clerks to get to the handful of Cabbage Patch dolls that were just 
delivered. (Come to think of it, whatever happened to those collectibles?) 
Of course, sometimes a little uncivilized behavior can be a hoot.
Sniping is an addictive, fun part of life on eBay. I recommend that you try it.
You’re likely to benefit from the results and enjoy your eBay experience even
more — especially if you’re an adrenaline junkie.
Sniping techniques for the beginner
Here’s a list of things to keep in mind when you get ready to place your 
snipe bid:

Book I
Chapter 6
Bidding to Win
Succeeding by Sniping
113
✦Know how high you’re willing to go. If you know you’re facing a lot of
competition, figure out your highest bid to the penny. You should have
already researched the item and figured out its value. Raise your bid
only to the level where you’re sure you’re getting a good return on your
investment; don’t go overboard. Certainly, if the item has some emo-
tional value and you just have to have it, bid as high as you want. But
remember, you’ll have to pay the piper later. You win it, you own it!
✦Know how fast (or slow) your Internet connection is. Before you start
sniping, figure out how long it takes to get your bid confirmed on eBay.
Test it a few times until you know how many seconds you have to spare
when placing a bid.
✦Don’t lose heart if you lose the auction. Remember, this is a game.
Although sellers love sniping because it drives up prices and bidders love it
because it’s fun, a sniper can ruin a week’s careful work on an auction strat-
egy. The most skillful snipers sneak in a bid so close to the end of the auction
that you have no chance to counter-bid. Losing too often, especially to the
same sniper, can be a drag.
If your Internet connection is slow and you want to do some sniping, make
your final bid two minutes before the auction ends and adjust the amount of
the bid as high as you feel comfortable so you can beat out the competition.
If you can make the highest bid with just 10 seconds left, you most likely will
win. With so many bids coming in the final seconds, your bid might be the
last one eBay records.
This stuff is supposed to be fun, so don’t lose perspective. If you can’t afford
an item, don’t get caught up in a bidding war. Otherwise, the only person
who wins is the seller. If you’re losing sleep, barking at your cat, or biting
your nails over an item, it’s time to rethink what you’re doing. If it’s taking up
too much of your life or an item costs too much, be willing to walk away —
or log off — and live to bid another day.
To snipe a bid manually (without a sniping service), first make sure you’re
signed in. Then follow these steps to snipe at the end of the auction:
1. In the last few minutes of the auction, locate the item you want to win
and press Ctrl+N to open a second window on your Internet browser.
Keep one window open for bidding, as shown in Figure 6-6.
2. Continuously click the reload or refresh button in the browser 
toolbar.
By reloading the item continually, you’ll be aware when you’re in the last
60 seconds of bidding. You also can see instantly whether anyone else is
doing any last-minute bidding.

Succeeding by Sniping
114
3. In the bid box of the second browser, type your maximum bid and
then click the Place Bid button.
You then face a page that, when you press the button, finalizes and con-
firms your bid on the item. Do not click the Confirm Bid button yet.
4. As the auction nears its end, confirm your final bid by clicking the
Confirm Bid button.
You know when the auction is almost over because you’re reloading
your first browser continually. The longer you can hold off bidding
before the auction ends, the better.
If you really want an item bad enough, you may want to set up a backup for
your snipe. Try my three-screen system, in which you can place a backup
high bid in case you catch another sniper swooping in on your item immedi-
ately after your first snipe.
Obviously, if you win with the first snipe, the second window is unnecessary.
But if you lose the first one, that second window feels like a real lifesaver!
If you’re outbid after two snipes, don’t cry. The winner paid way more than
you were willing to pay. It’s not much consolation, but rarely is an item so
rare that you only see it come on the auction block once in a lifetime.

Auto-sniping your auctions
My daughter says that I can make almost anything high maintenance, and
she may very well be right. When it comes to eBay bidding and winning, a
bunch of software programs and Web sites can help automate your shopping
and feedback process. I like that they will bid for me whether I’m near a com-
puter or sleeping peacefully.
Here are a couple that I have used successfully:
✦BidRobot: Shown in Figure 6-7, BidRobot deftly places sniping bids for
you from its servers. It’s won many an auction for me while I’ve been on
the road or busy writing. The service is one of the least expensive out
there, charging a low flat rate. Get a three-week free trial (all you can
snipe for three weeks!) at
www.bidrobot.com/cool
✦eSnipe: Another popular sniping server is eSnipe, shown in Figure 6-8.
This service charges a fee of approximately 1% of the final winning price,
with a maximum of $10. You pay only if you win. You can purchase Bid
Points to place in your account to pay for upcoming snipes. For 14 days
of free sniping, use this link:

Retracting Your Bid in an Emergency

Retracting Your Bid in an Emergency
We’re all human and we all make mistakes. Luckily for everyone, eBay mem-
bers are allowed to retract bids under certain circumstances. You may
retract your bid if you meet one of the following criteria:
✦You accidentally typed the wrong bid amount: Say you typed $900
but you meant $9.00. Oops. In a case like this, you can retract the bid, but
you’d better rebid the proper amount (that original $9.00) immediately,
or you may be in violation of eBay’s policies.
Figure 6-8:
Snipes
ready to go
at eSnipe.
Knowing what you’re buying
Before you place a bid, be sure that you know
the item’s street price, which is the price that
people actually pay — not the MSRP (manu-
facturer’s suggested retail price). You can use
the Internet to check prices for many items. 
In fact, several consumer Web sites are 
dedicated to serving savvy consumers by offer-
ing this information. You can find prices for
computer items at www.pricewatch.com.
Prices for almost everything else can be found
at this Google site: www.froogle.com. You
may be comfortable paying slightly more than
the street price because eBay is so easy to 
use — after all, the item is delivered to your
door and you don’t have to go to a bricks-and-
mortar store to shop for the item.

✦The seller has added information to the item description that changes
the value of the item considerably: The bull that was let loose in the
seller’s shop has changed the mint condition of the Ming vase you just
bid on? No problem.
✦You can’t reach the seller through eBay’s e-mail or through the tele-
phone number you got from eBay’s find members area: Seller gone
AWOL and you have a question about an item you’ve bid on? You can
use eBay’s e-mail system by clicking Ask the Seller a Question in the
Seller Information box on the auction page. Or to get the seller’s tele-
phone number, click the Advanced Search link (at the top-right corner of
most eBay pages) and then click the Find a Member link (on the left side
of the page). Next, input your transaction number and the seller’s user
ID. After checking to make sure that you’ve begun a transaction with this
person, the good people at eBay will send the seller’s telephone number
in an e-mail message to your registered e-mail address. Your phone
number will also be e-mailed to the seller.
Every time you retract a bid, it appears in the feedback area or your eBay
ID card.
Here are a couple of additional restrictions to retracting bids:
✦You can retract a bid only if it was placed before the last 12 hours of
an auction. If you bid more than once in the last 12 hours of the same
auction, all your bids are retracted.
✦When you retract a bid because of a bidding error, you wipe out any
of your previous bids in the auction. To reinstate yourself as a bidder,
you must bid again immediately.
If you have to retract your bid within the last 12 hours of the auction, you
must send an e-mail to the seller asking him or her to cancel your bid. It is
up to the seller whether to cancel your bid. A bid retraction isn’t a guarantee
that you will get out of purchasing the item. Sometimes, sellers simply don’t
have the opportunity or time to cancel a bid. That means you have to buy
the item.
You’ll probably never need this link, but to retract your bid (or find more
information), go to
http://offer.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?RetractBidShow
You can find your way to the Bid Retraction form also by clicking the Buying
Related links on your My eBay All Buying page.
eBay vigorously investigates members who abuse bid retractions. Too many
bid retractions and you may find yourself suspended from the system.

Congratulations — now what do you do? You have to follow up on 
your victory and keep a sharp eye on what you’re doing. The post-auction
process can be loaded with pitfalls and headaches if you don’t follow 
proper procedure. Money, like a full moon, does strange things to people
sometimes.
In this chapter, you get a handle on what’s in store for you after you win an
auction. I clue you in on what the seller is supposed to do to make the transac-
tion go smoothly and show you how to grab hold of your responsibilities as
a buyer. You find out about proper post-auction etiquette, including the best
ways to get organized, communicate with the seller professionally, and send
your payment without hazards. I also brief you on how to handle an imper-
fect transaction.
Throughout the bidding process, the dollar amounts of items you’re winning
appear in green on your My eBay: All Buying page. If you’ve been outbid,
they appear in red.
After the auction ends, there’s no marching band, no visit from a camera
crew, no armful of roses, and no oversized check to duck behind. In fact,

the All Buying: Won section of your My eBay page than you are to hear it
from eBay. eBay tries to get its end-of-auction e-mails (EOAs) out pronto, but
sometimes there’s a lag. After you win, you can go back to the item and see a
checkout link on the item page. For a look at all the contact information in
the end-of-auction e-mail, see Figure 7-1.
If you can receive text messages on your cell phone, eBay will send EOA
notices to your phone. Find out your wireless e-mail address from your cell
phone provider — it’s usually available from the provider’s home page, for
example, www.nextel.com or www.tmobile.com. Then go to your My eBay
page, find the My Account: Personal Information area, and click the Change
link. After you’ve entered your contact information there, click the Change
My Notification Preferences link and select which notifications you want sent
to your mobile phone. That way, no matter where you are, you’ll know when
you have won an auction (and need to get payment out ASAP)!
Checking Out
When you buy something in a store, you need to check out to pay. eBay isn’t
much different. eBay’s checkout is a convenient way to pay for your completed
auction or Buy it Now sale with a credit card or eCheck through PayPal. You
may also use checkout to exchange information with the seller and pay for
your item using a money order, a check, or another payment service that the
seller accepts.

Checkout is integrated directly onto the item page so that you can win and
pay for an item in less than a minute, as shown in Figure 7-2. Some sellers
indicate, in their description, that they do not want you to use eBay’s check-
out and will e-mail the winner a link to their private, off-eBay or PayPal
checkout page.
When you click the Pay Now button, you are taken to the checkout page.
You can make an immediate payment only if the seller accepts PayPal. If the
seller accepts other types of payment, such as a personal check or a money
order, you can indicate which type of payment you want to use and this page
will send the seller your shipping information. If the shipping cost is based
on your zip code, or the seller offers discounts on buying multiple items, you
can make any such changes on the page and recalculate the total. Then you
can go ahead and send the payment.
When I talk to people about why they don’t buy on eBay, the most frequent
answer is that they’re afraid of giving out their credit card information. The
second-most common reason is that they don’t want to send money to
strangers. In addition to all the eBay safeguards that I mention in previous
chapters, the next section gives you the inside scoop on how to stay safe
when sending your payment to the sellers. You’ll be surprised to know that
there are distinct levels of safety in how you can send a payment to a seller.
Using Your Credit Card Safely
The safest way to shop on eBay is to use a credit card. In most cases, your
credit card company will stand behind you if you encounter problems using
your card online.

Using Your Credit Card Safely
122
Knowing your credit card company’s policy
Before you start bidding, find out how your credit card company handles
fraud claims. The major credit card companies — American Express, Discover,
MasterCard, and Visa — have different policies as to how they will stand
behind you when it comes to online purchases:
✦American Express: American Express offers “ironclad protection” for
online shoppers. The company claims that there’s “no fine print and no
deductible” if you need to rely on American Express to help you fight a
fraudulent transaction.
www.americanexpress.com/cards/online_guarantee
✦Discover: Discover offers 100% fraud protection. The company even offers
a free downloadable Discover Deskshop, which generates a single-use
card number each time you shop online so that your account number is
never transferred over the Internet.
www.discovercard.com/discover/data/account/security
privacy/shopping.shtml
✦MasterCard: The program offered by MasterCard is called Zero Liability
and is offered if MasterCard deems your account in good standing, you
haven’t broadcast personal account information online frivolously, and
you haven’t reported more than two “unauthorized events” in the past
12 months.
It appears that MasterCard is the final judge when it comes to fraud, not
you, so be careful.
www.mastercard.com/general/zero_liability.html
✦Visa: Visa seems to like the phrase zero liability, as well. Your liability for
unauthorized transactions is $0. A new program, called Verified by Visa,
lets you set up your own private password that you use with your Visa
card any time you use it online.
www.usa.visa.com/personal/security/zero_liability.html
Every once in a while, check your statement, visit your credit card company’s
Web site, or call the credit card company’s customer service department to
verify its current fraud protection policy for online purchases.
Never — really, I mean never ever — send your credit card information to
anyone through e-mail. E-mail is the most insecure way to send information.
As your e-mail makes its way from your computer to the recipient’s desktop,
it makes micro stops along the way. These stops may take just nanoseconds,
but your information is open for reading by outside parties (at least those
who have the right expertise) at any stop along the journey.

Adding a layer of protection with an online 
checkout service
Many eBay sellers use an independent online checkout service that allows
them to process shipping information, combine purchases, give an exact
shipping total, and receive credit card payments. If the seller uses such a
service, you probably see a clickable link in the e-mail that’s sent to you at
the end of the auction. The link leads you to an online checkout page.
Checking for sure signs of security
When you come to the point in the checkout process where you must input
your credit card information (see Figure 7-3), look for the following:
✦Find the small closed padlock icon or the key icon: These icons tell
you that the site hosting the checkout is secure. You can find these 
icons in the lower-right corner of your browser window.
✦Check the URL for an s: The URL (Web site address) may change from a
prefix of http:// to https:// (the s stands for secure).
✦Look for SSL: You may also see the initials SSL in the Web site’s address
or somewhere on the page. SSL stands for Secure Sockes Layer.
Any, some, or all of the preceding items indicate that the Web site uses
security encryption methods. Translation? No one but you and the mer-
chant can read or view your payment information.

Paying with PayPal

Paying with PayPal
PayPal is my preferred method of payment on eBay. I’ve been happily using
PayPal since the company was introduced to eBay, and I’ve always had posi-
tive results. Well, okay, not always. No service can make a slow or lazy seller
into the picture of efficiency. The advantage of PayPal, though, is that you
don’t have to get your hands dirty.
For example, I once had a problem with a slow-shipping seller. Luckily I had
paid him using PayPal. I filed a complaint through PayPal and I got my mer-
chandise shipped out within a day!
The folks at eBay know a good thing when they see it, so they acquired
PayPal late in 2002. Now PayPal payments are integrated into eBay’s check-
out process.
Registering at PayPal
When you register to use PayPal, you have to give your name, address,
phone number, and e-mail address. You also have to make up a password.
Make your password more than six characters, and use numbers and 
letters — revisit Chapter 3 for more information on registration security.
You have to select a security question. The safest is your pet’s name, your
city of birth, or the last four digits of your Social Security number. You have
to click to put a check mark next to the paragraph that says you have read
and agree to PayPal’s User Agreement and Privacy policy. (There are links
so you can read them.) When you’re convinced that you understand what
PayPal’s all about and what it expects of you, click Sign Up.
PayPal sends you an e-mail confirming your registration. The e-mail arrives
almost instantaneously to the e-mail address you used at registration, con-
taining a link. When you receive the e-mail, click the link to visit the PayPal
site. Enter the password that was used to create your account. Bingo —
you’re in.
Giving PayPal credit card or checking account 
information
Of course, you also have to add a credit card if you want to pay for anything
with a credit card. If you don’t have a credit card or would like to occasion-
ally pay for things directly from your bank account, you have to register
your checking account.

I can see you beginning to squirm; you’re not comfortable giving that type of
information to anyone, much less putting it out on the Internet. Relax. PayPal
uses military-strength encryption technology to keep your account informa-
tion safe, so don’t be afraid to give up your data.
To register your credit card, you’ll have to input the name on the card (the
last name is already filled in with the name you registered on the account),
the expiration date, and the card verification number. The card verification
number is the three-digit number on the back of the card, imprinted next to
the last few digits of the card number in the area where you sign. (American
Express verification numbers are on the front of the card.) PayPal also asks
you to supply a billing address.
On an American Express card, the card verification number is the four-digit
number on the right side of the face of the card.
When you enter all the information PayPal needs, click the Add button.
PayPal submits your information to your credit card company for confirma-
tion. This process may take a minute or so, but eventually your credit card
company says that you are who you say you are, and the card is added to
your PayPal account. You can register four active credit cards.
Registering your checking account is just as easy. You supply the informa-
tion from the bottom of one of your checks, as shown in Figure 7-4.
Your credit card company and PayPal
To be a good consumer, you need to take
responsibility for your transactions. Be sure you
understand your credit card terms and condi-
tions when it comes to third-party payment
services. Each credit card company has its
own agreement with PayPal and each com-
pany has a different view on how to handle
PayPal transactions. For example, Visa and
MasterCard treat PayPal as the merchant of
record in your transactions, meaning that
PayPal ends up as the responsible party if you
don’t receive the merchandise or if you dispute
the transaction. If you make a complaint about
a charge made on your Visa or MasterCard, the
credit card company just yanks the money from
PayPal, and it’s up to PayPal to settle things
with the seller.
At the time of this writing, Discover and
American Express treat PayPal transactions
somewhat like a cash advance — a money
transfer of sorts. I just checked a couple of my
past Discover and American Express bills, and
the PayPal charges look like any other charges.
The only difference is how these credit card
companies handle their level of liability in third-
party payment services. PayPal backs up
eBay’s insurance (see Chapter 5) with additional
coverage (see “Giving PayPal credit card or
checking account information”). This coverage
can be good for purchases up to $1000.

Paying with PayPal
126
Getting PayPal-verified
When PayPal has the information it needs, it makes two small deposits into
that account. (When I say small, I mean small!) After a week or so, call your
bank and find out the amount of these two deposits. When you have the
amounts, sign on to the PayPal Web site with your password, and type the
amounts in the appropriate place. Voilà! Your account is registered — and,
not coincidentally, you’re verified! PayPal has confirmed that you hold an
active account with your bank. All banks are required to screen their account
holders, and verification authenticates your identity to anyone who does
business with you.
Here are some benefits of being PayPal-verified:
✦Verification increases your spending limit from $1000 to unlimited!
(Uh-Oh!)
✦You can register eight active credit cards instead of four. (Now you can
take advantage of that unlimited spending amount even faster.)
✦You’re covered by PayPal’s additional $300 fraud insurance. (This fea-
ture alone is worth the trouble of signing onto PayPal.)
If your eBay purchase qualifies for coverage under eBay’s fraud protection
plan (which I describe in Chapter 5), you are also covered for an additional
$300 from PayPal when you purchase your item from a PayPal-verified seller.
(See Chapter 5 on how to confirm that the seller has PayPal buyer protection
coverage.)
Ways to pay through PayPal
The easiest and most efficient way to pay for eBay purchases is by credit
card. If you are not a PayPal-verified buyer, you still have your credit card’s
fraud protection guarantee behind you.

eBay sees to it that PayPal is incredibly easy to use because PayPal is the
official payment service at eBay. After the auction is over, a link to pay
appears. If you prefer, wait until you hear from the seller. (I always like 
to have the seller’s full name and address for my records before I send 
payment — especially if the amount of the transaction exceeds eBay’s 
fraud protection program limit.)
You may also send money directly from your bank account (either savings or
checking) through instant transfer or eCheck.
✦Instant transfer: An instant transfer is immediately debited from your
bank account and deposited into the seller’s account — so you’d best 
be sure you have the funds in your account to back up the purchase now
(not tomorrow, not next week). PayPal requires you to back up an instant
transfer with a credit card, just in case you’ve miscalculated your account
balance.
✦eCheck: You may also write an eCheck, which is just like writing a check,
only you don’t write it with a pen. Like regular, plain vanilla paper checks,
eChecks take three to four days to clear, and do not post to the seller’s
account as paid until then. The seller probably won’t ship your item until
PayPal tells them it has cleared your bank.
✦Credit card: You can use your American Express, Discover, Visa, or
MasterCard to make your payment through PayPal. The cost of the item
is charged to your card, and your statement reflects a PayPal payment
with the seller’s ID.
Sellers will not ship your item until the eCheck clears, so if you’re in a hurry,
don’t use this option.
Using PayPal’s eBay Payment Tool
PayPal also has a service that allows you to find all the auctions you’ve won
on eBay that need to be paid. Here’s how it works. Say you’ve just won a
bunch of auctions by different sellers, and you want to pay for them all at
once. Okay, so visit the PayPal site and sign in.
Click the eBay Items Won link on the top of your PayPal summary page.
PayPal searches the eBay site and finds all the auctions you’ve won on eBay
and haven’t paid for. The unpaid transactions appear on a page as shown in
Figure 7-5.
You can only use this tool with sellers that accept PayPal. You must click the
link for every auction to be sure that the seller accepts PayPal because all
auctions you’ve won on eBay show up on the results page.

Paying with PayPal
128
On the PayPal Pay for eBay Items page, just click the Pay button and go
through the payment process. Click the Remove button to exclude sellers
that don’t accept PayPal or if you’ve paid them in an alternate fashion.
Making a PayPal payment
After you win an auction, buy an item in a Buy It Now transaction, or pur-
chase an item from an eBay store, it’s time to pay. You can pay immediately
by clicking the Pay Now icon on the item page.
On the next screen, as shown in Figure 7-6, you see an invoice type page.
Double-check that all the information is correct. If insurance is optional, and
you don’t want shipping insurance, just delete the amount. If you’re entitled
to a multiple-item discount, you can put that in too. If you are unclear as to
how much to pay, there is a link to ask the seller for a total.
Assuming that you’ve already become a registered (verified) PayPal user,
you see a place at the very bottom of the page to input your e-mail address
and password. Fill in this info, and click the button that says Continue.
A page appears and you must decide whether you want to pay by credit card
or bank transfer. If you have a balance in your PayPal account, you must use
that money to make your payment; so withdraw your PayPal balance first if
you want to pay with a credit card. Finalize all the details of your transaction
by filling in any open blanks and indicating your payment choice. You can
even send a note to the seller along with your payment.

If you want some information to go to the seller regarding your transaction,
send the information in a separate e-mail message. The Note to seller is buried
in a much longer e-mail message that PayPal sends to the seller, and it’s hard
to find. (PayPal sends sellers an e-mail within a few hours saying that it has
received your payment.) So any important messages should be sent separately.
Put your transaction number or item name in the Subject line.
Sending a Money Order
Money orders are beloved by all eBay sellers! Even though PayPal is usually
their first choice — because payment arrives almost instantaneously and
sellers avoid having to track payments they’re waiting for — money orders
are a close second because they’re just like cash.
Many sellers just cash their money orders or bring postal money orders with
them to the post office to pay for postage. No fuss, no muss — no need to
deposit the money order in the bank. Get it? (Wink, wink.)

Writing a Check
130
For a $0.90 fee, you can purchase money orders at the post office. If you
don’t want to wait in line, convenience stores and supermarkets sell them
for around $1.00. Don’t get a money order at your bank, where you’ll pay
around $5.00 for the privilege of purchasing a money order!
An online service called BidPay, which is owned by Western Union (the 
venerable telegram people have come of age), can sell you a money order
(charged to your credit or debit card) and mail it to the seller for you.
BidPay (www.bidpay.com) charges $2.95 for money orders up to $30, 
and $5 for money orders up to $100. Amounts over $100 are 2.25% + $5.00.
This may seem like a pricey option, but you might find it useful if you’re
glued to your computer.
Writing a Check
Personal checks are not a preferred method of payment by veteran sellers at
eBay for many reasons. Let me explain why using an illustration:
I sold a beautiful, brand-new Diane Von Furstenberg wrap dress (retail price
$350 — an eBay bargain at $149!) to a lovely lady on the east coast. She sent
me a check, which I immediately deposited. I waited 10 business days, which
was my policy, and sent the dress on the 11th day. On the 12th day, the bank
returned the check to me. Certainly this lady knew her check had bounced.
She could have e-mailed me to let me know, but she didn’t. I called the buyer
Beware the money order
For the same reason that eBay sellers love
money orders, you have to be excruciatingly
careful to whom you send money orders. The
bottom line is that you are sending cash. A
seller can cash a money order and “forget” to
send you the merchandise you paid for. How
could a seller possibly forget to send you some-
thing you paid for with your hard-earned
money? Cash payment = no receipt. No receipt
= no paper trail. No paper trail = no proof. No
proof = seller amnesia.
You may not consider the convenience of a
money order worth the risk involved. For 
example, if you pay by money order, you have
no recourse other than reporting problems to
some federal agency about mail fraud. I’m sure
that some nice government employee will hap-
pily take a report and sound interested and
sympathetic, but the bottom line is that you’ll be
out your money. Plus, you don’t get the extra
muscle that you get when a credit card com-
pany backs you up.
If your transaction falls within eBay’s fraud pro-
tection policy, you’ll be covered up to $200, but
if not, you could be kissing your money good-
bye. Caveat emptor!

and she sent a money order that covered both the check and the bounced
check fees my bank charged me. But I didn’t need the aggravation. And I was
lucky because many sellers never get their money. Bounced checks can be a
real problem for eBay sellers.
I’ll give you an important reason never to send a check to anyone when you
shop on eBay. As a matter of fact, when you read my warning, you may never
want to write a check in a store again. Take a glance again at Figure 7-4.
Remember that information on your check? Think about what someone
might be able to do with that information and your home address. If some-
one really wants to, he or she also can get your phone number. And if you
have your Social Security number on your check (which you shouldn’t),
someone can practically set up shop as you!
Save yourself the trouble. Don’t send out personal checks.
Paying through CheckFree
In the late ‘90s, I signed up and paid bills through CheckFree (they’ve been
around since 1981), which turned around and debited my bank account.
They now apply their same secure technology to eBay payments.
CheckFree is the oldest and largest payment processor on the Web. Nine 
million people safely pay their bills through CheckFree. If the seller accepts
CheckFree for payment (as indicated in their auction listing), you can go 
to www.mycheckfree.com and pay the seller directly. It’s safe and secure.
Sending Payment Promptly and Securely
How many times have you heard the saying “The check is in the mail”? Yeah,
I’ve heard it about a thousand times, too. If you’re on the selling end of a
transaction, hearing this line from the buyer but not getting the money is
frustrating. If you’re on the buying end, it’s bad form and may also lead to
bad feedback for you.
Being the good buyer that you are, you’ll get your payment out pronto. If
you’ve purchased an item and intend to pay using PayPal, do it immediately —
why wait? (The sooner you pay, the sooner you get that charming gold-
trimmed Flying Monkey decanter you won!)
Most sellers expect to get paid within seven business days after the close of
the auction. Although this timeline isn’t mandatory, it makes good sense to
let the seller know that payment is on the way.

Contacting the Seller
132
Send your payment promptly. If you have to delay payment for any reason
(you have to go out of town, you ran out of checks, you broke your leg), let
the seller know as soon as possible. Most sellers understand if you send
them a kind and honest e-mail. Let the seller know what’s up; give him or her
a date by which the money can be expected, and then meet that deadline. If
the wait is unreasonably long, the seller may cancel the transaction. In that
case, you can expect to get some bad feedback.
Here are some tips on how to make sure that your payment reaches the
seller promptly and safely:
✦Have your name and address printed on your checks. A check without a
printed name or address sends a red flag to sellers that the check may
not clear. For privacy and safety reasons, though, never put your driver’s
license number or Social Security number on your check.
✦Always write the item title and your user ID on a check or money order
and enclose a printout of the final auction page in the envelope. The
number-one pet peeve of most eBay sellers is when buyers send checks
without any auction information.
✦If you’re paying with a credit card without using a payment service and
want to provide the number over the telephone, be sure to request the
seller’s phone number in your reply to the seller’s initial e-mail and
explain why you want it.
✦You can safely e-mail your credit card information over the course of
several e-mails, each containing four numbers from your credit card.
Stagger your e-mails so that they’re about 20 minutes apart and don’t
forget to let the seller know what kind of credit card you’re using. Also,
give the card’s expiration date.
Buyers routinely send out payments without their name, their address, or a
clue as to what they’ve purchased. No matter how you pay, be sure to include
a copy of the eBay confirmation letter, a printout of the auction page, or a
copy of the e-mail the seller sent you. If you pay with a credit card through
e-mail or over the phone, you should still send this info through the mail just
to be on the safe side.
Contacting the Seller
eBay rules and regulations state that buyers and sellers must contact each
other by e-mail within three business days of the auction’s end. For example,
if an item closes on a Saturday, you need to make contact by Wednesday.

Book I
Chapter 7
Completing the
Transaction
Contacting the Seller
133
Most sellers contact auction winners promptly because they want to com-
plete the transaction and get paid. Few buyers or sellers wait for the official
eBay EOA e-mail to contact each other. If you’ve won an item and intend to
pay through PayPal, it’s de rigueur for you to use the Pay Now link on the
item page as soon as possible after you’ve won.
If you need to contact the seller before sending payment, you have several
ways to find contact information:
✦Click the Ask Seller a Question link on the auction page, which takes you
to the Ask Seller a Question form.
✦Click the Site Map link, located above the navigation bar on every eBay
page, and then click the Search for Members link.
✦Click the Advanced Search link (at the top-right corner of all eBay pages),
and then click the Find Contact Information link (on the left side of the
page).
Within the first three business days after an auction or a Buy it Now transac-
tion, limit yourself to using the Ask Seller a Question form. The seller (if signed
in) sees the buyer’s e-mail address on the item page after the sale is closed.
eBay doesn’t tolerate abuses of its contact system. Make sure that you use
this resource to communicate with another user only about a specific trans-
action in which you are participating. To use contact information to complete
a deal outside eBay is an infringement of the rules. If you abuse the contact
system, eBay can investigate you and kick you off the site.
Getting the seller’s phone number
If you don’t hear from the seller after three busi-
ness days and you’ve already tried sending an
e-mail, you need to get more contact informa-
tion. Remember back when you registered and
eBay asked for a phone number? eBay keeps
this information for times like this.
To get an eBay member’s phone number, go
back to Find Contact Information on the
Advanced Search: Members: Find Contact
Information link. Fill out the Contact Info form
by entering the seller’s user ID and the number
of the item that you’re buying, and then click the
Search button. If all the information is correct,
you automatically see a request-confirmation
page and eBay generates an e-mail message
to both you and the other user.
eBay’s e-mail message includes the seller’s
user ID, name, company, city, state, and coun-
try of residence, as well as the seller’s phone
number and date of initial registration. eBay
sends this same information about you to the
user you want to get in touch with. Most sellers
jump to attention when they receive this e-mail
from eBay and get the ball rolling to complete
the transaction.

Leaving Responsible Feedback
134
Leaving Responsible Feedback
Almost any eBay seller will tell you that one of his or her pet peeves about
the eBay feedback system is that new community members tend to leave
neutral or, even worse, negative, feedback the moment a shipment arrives
and something is wrong. In this section, I tell you what you need to know to
avoid getting a bad rap for being too hard on sellers.
Missing or damaged shipment
When a package leaves the seller’s hands, it is literally (and completely) out
of his or her hands. If UPS, Federal Express Ground, or Federal Express Air
ships your package, the tracking number can track the item. Tracking offered
by the U.S. Post Office can be casual (at best) and is often not scanned until
the package is delivered to your door, thus negating the trackability (for lack
of a better term) of the package. Here are a few things to remember:
✦Be sure you know when the seller plans to ship the merchandise, so
there is less question about when it will probably arrive. If this informa-
tion isn’t stated in the auction description, use the Ask Seller a Question
link to find out — before you buy — whether the shipping schedule
matches your needs.
✦If you do not pay the seller extra money to purchase insurance before
your item is shipped, it’s unfair to hold the seller responsible for dam-
aged or lost shipments. Period. End of story.
✦Open your packages immediately upon receipt. A seller can’t make a
claim on an item that you report damaged in shipping a month after it
arrives, so leaving negative feedback at that point is unfair. Most ship-
pers insist that any and all damage be reported within five days of
receipt. Also, if damage has occurred, keep all packing materials for
inspection by the carrier. If you fail to save these materials, the carrier
may not accept your claim and you will have no further recourse.
✦A seller can’t do much about a missing package. Sellers can’t even make
a claim on a postal shipment until 30 days have passed since mailing.
✦If the item never arrives, only the sender can file a claim with the ship-
ping company and must produce all shipping receipts. Notify the seller
immediately by e-mail or telephone upon receiving a damaged shipment.
Leaving negative feedback before contacting the seller is just plain unjust. 
Item doesn’t meet your expectations
If the item arrives and isn’t as described in the item description, e-mail the
seller. Communication is a good thing and most sellers want to preserve
their reputations. Give the seller the opportunity to work things out with
you. Keep in mind these facts:

Book I
Chapter 7
Completing the
Transaction
Leaving Responsible Feedback
135
✦If a new item in a manufacturer’s sealed box arrives damaged, the
damage could have happened at the manufacturer and the seller 
wouldn’t even know about it.
✦A seller may not be as experienced in a particular collectible as you are.
If you didn’t ask all the necessary questions before bidding, you may
have received what the seller assumed was a collectible. It’s up to the
buyer to ask questions before placing a bid.
✦If you receive the wrong item, the seller might have simply mixed up
labels. Don’t jump to leave negative feedback. Just notify the seller, who
will no doubt work out the mistake with you.
Most importantly, sellers should be given the chance to prove they care. If
you can’t come to terms with the seller, try contacting SquareTrade (see
Chapter 5) for online dispute resolution. If you feel that you’re a victim of
fraud, you can apply for eBay’s fraud protection (see Chapter 5).
Choosing your words carefully
Good sellers should be rewarded, and potential buyers should be informed.
That’s why no eBay transaction is complete until the buyer fills out the feed-
back form. Before leaving any feedback, remember that sometimes no one’s
at fault when transactions get fouled up. Here are some handy hints on what
kind of feedback to leave for a seller:
✦Give the seller the benefit of the doubt. If the transaction could have
been a nightmare, but the seller tried to make it right and meet you
halfway, that’s an easy call — leave positive feedback.
✦Whenever possible, reward someone who seems honest or tried to cor-
rect a bad situation. For example, if the seller worked at a snail’s pace
but you eventually got your item and you’re thrilled with it, you may
want to leave positive feedback with a caveat. Something like “Item as
described, good seller, but very slow to deliver” sends the right feed-
back message.
✦If the seller worked at a snail’s pace but packaged the item adequately
and the item was kinda sorta what you expected, you may want to leave
neutral feedback. That is, the experience wasn’t bad enough for negative
feedback but didn’t deserve praise. Here’s an example: “Really slow to
deliver, didn’t say item condition was good not excellent, but did deliver.”
Wishy-washy is okay as a response to so-so; at least the next buyer will
know to ask specific questions.
✦If the seller doesn’t ship your item or the item doesn’t match the descrip-
tion and the seller won’t make things right, you need to leave negative
feedback. But never write negative feedback in the heat of the moment and
never make it personal. Do expect a response, but don’t get into a negative
feedback war. Life’s interesting enough without taking on extra hassles.

Leaving Responsible Feedback
136
Remember that you cannot retract feedback. You are responsible for your
words. They will remain on the eBay site forever, with your user ID next to
them for all to see. Be sure to leave a simple, factual, and unemotional state-
ment. Important things to mention in your feedback are
✦How satisfied you are with your purchase
✦The quality of the packaging
✦The promptness of shipping
✦The seller’s professionalism
✦The level of communication
If you must leave a negative feedback comment, know that you will probably
get one in return. If you couldn’t resolve things without a problem, chances
are the seller wasn’t happy with the trading experience either. Try to work
things out first!

Bay is more than just an Internet location for buying and selling great
stuff. Most of all, eBay is about people. eBay wants the world to know
that it has created (and works hard to maintain) a community. And prime
real estate in this community costs only pennies! As in real-life communities,
you participate as much as works for you. You can get involved in all sorts
of neighborhood activities, or you can just sit back, mind your own busi-
ness, and watch the world go by.
As you’ve probably heard by now, one of the main ways to participate in the
eBay community is through feedback (which I explain in detail in Chapter 7).
In this chapter, I show you some other ways to become part of the commu-
nity. You can socialize, get information from other members, leave messages,
or just read what everybody’s talking about on eBay’s message boards, chat
boards, and corporate announcement board. I include tips on how to use all
these places to your benefit. The tools in this chapter help you solidify your
place in the community that is eBay.
Your Home on eBay: About Me
Want to know more about the people behind those user IDs? Thousands of
eBay members have created personal Web pages on eBay called About Me
pages. eBay users with active About Me pages have a Me icon (with a blue
lowercase m and a red lowercase e) next to their user IDs.
If you’re on eBay, you need an About Me page. Checking out the About Me
page of people you conduct business with gives you an opportunity to get
to know them. Because eBay is a cyberspace market, you have no other way
to let prospective bidders know that you’re a real person. Don’t you shop at
some stores because you like the owners or people who work there? The
About Me page takes a first step toward establishing a professional and
trusted identity at eBay.

Your Home on eBay: About Me
138
The About Me page enables you to personalize yourself as a bidder to sellers
and as a business to prospective bidders. (See Figure 8-1 for an example.)
Your About Me page also becomes your About the Seller page if you have an
eBay store.
An About Me page benefits you also when you buy. Sellers usually like to
know about their bidders to build confidence in their trading partners. See
an example of a personal My eBay page in Figure 8-2.
If you don’t have an About Me page, put this book down and set one up
immediately. It doesn’t have to be a work of art; just get something up there
to tell the rest of the community who you are. You can always go back later
and add to or redesign it.
The About Me page can also be a deal maker or a deal breaker. Once I was
looking around eBay for some extra-long printer cables, and I found several
sellers selling just what I wanted. One of the lower-priced sellers had a low
feedback rating because he was new on eBay. But he had an About Me page,
so I clicked. I found out that the seller was a computer technician by trade

and that he and his son made these computer cables together as a family
business at home in the evenings. The money they made went to pay for
their father-son trips to see their favorite baseball team play. What a great
family enterprise! Better yet, he guaranteed the cables. As you might have
guessed, I bought the cables, and we both got positive feedback.
When you plan your About Me page, consider adding the following:
✦Who you are and where you live.
✦Your hobbies. If you collect things, here’s where to let the world know.

Your Home on eBay: About Me
140
To create your page, click the Me icon next to any user’s name, scroll to the
bottom of the About Me page that appears, find the line that reads “To create
your own About Me page, click here,” and click. You can also click the About
Me link on the My Account: Personal Information page on My eBay or the
Service page. Or go to
http://members.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?AboutMeLogin
Then follow the simple formatted template for your first page and work from
there.
When you begin to sell on eBay, your About Me page is an important sales
tool, so take your time when you create your page. A well-thought-out About
Me page improves your sales because people who come across your auctions
and check out your About Me page can get a sense of who you are and how
serious you are about your eBay activities. They instantly see that you’re no
fly-by-night seller.
Before you create your About Me page, I suggest that you look at what other
users have done. eBay members often include pictures, links to other Web
sites (including their personal or business home pages), and links to just
about any Web location that reflects their personality. If your purpose is to
generate more business, I recommend that you keep your About Me page
focused on your auction listings, with a link to your Web site.
The page can be as simple or as complex as you want. You may use one of
eBay’s templates as presented or gussy up the page with lots of pictures and
varied text using HTML
Sellers with many auctions running at once often add a message to their
About Me pages indicating that they’re willing to reduce shipping charges
if bidders bid on their other auctions as well. This direct tactic may lack
nuance, but it increases the number of people who look at (and bid on) your
auctions.
Gathering your thoughts
There are several things you must think about prior to setting up your page:
✦Title: Come up with a title for your page. It should be as simple as a 
welcome greeting.
✦Subtitle: This consists of a few words below your page title that elabo-
rate on your page theme.
✦Introductory paragraph: This paragraph can tell a little about you and
your hobbies or interests. You can also talk about the items you sell on
eBay, but most of all, it should reflect your personality.

Book I
Chapter 8

in the Community
Your Home on eBay: About Me
141
In the paragraphs of the About Me page, you can use HTML to add images
or fancy text. The titles, however, are standard and won’t permit HTML
coding.
✦Second subtitle and paragraph: Here you can elaborate on your inter-
ests and business on eBay. Add more information. Pictures are good too!
✦eBay activity: Decide what you’d like to show on the page — how many
of your most recent feedback comments and whether you’d like to show
your current listings on the page.
Don’t get carried away by showing your last 100 feedback messages;
doing so takes up too much space. Display either 10 or 25 and leave it at
that. If visitors want to know more about your feedback rating, they can
click your feedback number. (After all, they clicked your Me icon to get
here, and that’s next to your feedback number.)
✦Web site links: Think of some of your favorite Web sites; also use yours
or a friend’s (ask first). You may legally put them on the page. This is the
only place where you can promote your own e-commerce Web site on
eBay: Be sure to do it if you have one. A link to an outside site can’t
appear on any other eBay page.
If you’ve been an advanced user on eBay for a while, consider adding the 
following to your existing My eBay page:
✦Your logo: If you’ve designed a logo for your eBay business, be sure to
put it on the page.
✦Returns policy: Outline your standard returns policy for your customers.
✦Shipping policy: Explain how you ship and when you ship. Offer dis-
counts on shipping for multiple purchases through your eBay store.
✦Searchable index to your eBay store: Let your customers search your
store by apparel size, brand name, or item. You can accomplish this with
HTML coding.
✦Payment methods: Let your customers know what payment methods
you accept.
Setting up the page
To create your About Me page, do the following:
1. Click the Services link.
The Services Overview page appears.
2. In the Member Reputation area, click the About Me Page link.

Your Home on eBay: About Me
142
3. If you haven’t signed in, type your user ID and password in the appro-
priate boxes.
You’re taken to the About Me page, as shown in Figure 8-3.
4. Click the Create Your Page button.
5. Decide whether you want to use eBay’s easy step-by-step process or
enter your own HTML code, and then click Continue.
Because entering HTML code assumes you really know what you’re
doing, I suggest that you choose the step-by-step process.
Using little-known, eBay-unique HTML tags
It’s not highly publicized, but you can use some unique-to-eBay HTML codes to give your My eBay
page a custom look. Some of these codes can be combined with others (such as those for bold
and color). Play around with them and see what you come up with! The following gives you the
secret codes (sorry, no decoder ring) that you can type into the HTML portion of your text entry:
<eBayUserID>: Displays your user ID and real-time feedback rating
<eBayUserID BOLD>: Displays your user ID and feedback rating in boldface
<eBayUserID NOLINK>: Displays your user ID with no clickable link (useful if you plan to
change your ID soon)
<eBayUserID NOFEEDBACK>: Displays your user ID with no feedback number after it
<eBayUserID BOLD NOFEEDBACK>: Combines two of the previous tags into one
<eBayFeedback>: Shows your up-to-the-minute feedback comments in real time
<eBayFeedback COLOR=”red”>: Changes the color of the second line on your feedback
comment table to red
<eBayFeedback TABLEWIDTH=”75%”>: Changes the width of your feedback comment
table as a percentage of the allowed space (the default value is 90%)
<eBayItemList>: Inserts a list of the items you currently have up for sale
<eBayItemList BIDS>: Displays everything you’re currently bidding on
<eBayTime>: Inserts the official eBay time into your text
<eBayMemberSince>: Inputs the date and time of your initial eBay registration

6. Enter the following information:
• Page title: Type the title of your About Me page (for example,
Welcome to Larry Lunch’s Lunchbox Place).
• Welcome paragraph: Type a personal, attention-grabbing bit of 
text that greets your visitors (something like Hey, I like lunchboxes a
lot — only more exciting). You have the option of typing in your own
HTML coding or using the buttons at the top of the box to change the
font, color, size, and attributes (see Figure 8-4). The HTML generator
is similar to the Sell Your Item page — and similar to most word 
processing programs.
You can preview your paragraph at any time by clicking Preview
Paragraph at the bottom of the text entry area. If you don’t like 
what you see, close the Preview window and continue to edit your
masterpiece.
• Another paragraph: Type text for the second paragraph of the page,
such as Vintage, Modern, Ancient, or I Collect All Kinds of Lunchboxes.
Then maybe talk about yourself or your collection (such as, I used to
stare at lunchboxes in the school cafeteria . . . only more, you know,
normal).

Me home
page.

• Picture: If you’re adding a picture, type a sentence describing it, for
example: This is my wife Loretta with our lunchbox collection.
• Picture URL: Type the Web site address (URL) where people can find
your picture. See Book V, Chapter 5 to find out how to upload digital
images to your own (probably free) image area.
• Feedback: Select how many of your feedback postings you want to
appear on your About Me page. (You can opt not to show any feed-
back, but I think you should put in a few comments, especially if
they’re complimentary, as in, “Larry sent my lunchbox promptly,
and it makes lunchtime a blast! Everybody stares at it. . . .”)
• Items for Sale: Select how many of your current auctions you want to
appear on your About Me page. If you don’t have any auctions running
at the moment, you can select the Show No Items option.
• Favorite Links: Type the names and URLs of any Web links you
want visitors to see, for example, a Web site that appraises lunch-
boxes (“It’s in excellent condition except for that petrified ham 
sandwich. . . .”).
7. After you’ve finished entering this information (and are happy with
how it looks), click Continue at the bottom of the page.
Don’t worry if you’re not absolutely wild about your page on the first
pass. The important part is to get it published. You can go back and
make changes as often as you want.

8. On the About Me Preview and Submit page, click the button that cor-
responds to the layout option you want.
You are presented with three layout options, as shown in Figure 8-5.
9. Scroll down the page and check out what your About Me page will
look like.
If you don’t like your current layout, go back up the page and change the
layout.
10. If you don’t like what you see, click the Back button and do some
more editing.
11. When you’re happy with your masterpiece, click the Submit button.
You did it. Now anyone in the world with access to the Internet can find
your personal About Me page on eBay.
Don’t forget to update your About Me page often. A good About Me page
makes bidders eager to know more about your auctions. An out-of-date About
Me page turns off potential bidders. If you choose to update, you need to edit
it using HTML. If you don’t use HTML, you have to create an entire new page.
You can link to your About Me page from your Web site or from your e-mail
because all About Me pages have their own personal URLs. You can find your
About Me page by typing members.ebay.com/aboutme/ followed by your
user ID. Here’s the URL for my page (shown in Figure 8-6):

The navigation bar has a handy Community link that connects you to the
people and happenings on eBay. eBay has more than 100 million members —
a bigger population than some countries — but it can still have that small-town
feel through groups, chat rooms, and discussion boards. Start on the main
Talk page by clicking Community on the main navigation bar. Then click Talk
on the subnavigation bar. Now you can access more than three dozen category-
specific chat and discussion boards, a bunch of general chat and discussion
boards, and help discussion boards.
But there’s a whole lot more to the eBay community, as you find out in this
section. Take a little time to explore it for yourself.
News and chat, this and that
The Community Overview page is not quite like The New York Times (“All
the News That’s Fit to Print”), but it is the place to go to find all the news,
chat board, and message board links. Figure 8-7 shows you what the page
looks like.

Here’s a list of the topmost headings on the main Community page:
✦News: This area contains links to the general announcement page, which
covers general news, policy changes, technology updates, system
announcements, and the eBay Chatter newsletter.
✦Talk: A click on a link in this section whisks you to eBay’s discussion
boards, chat rooms, or answer center.
✦Events: Click here to find out what’s going on at eBay.
✦People: This is where you can get social, join groups, find out about
community values, and get stories from eBay members about their bid-
ding adventures.
Hear ye, Hear ye! eBay’s announcement boards
If you were living in the 1700s, you’d see a strangely dressed guy in a funny
hat ringing a bell and yelling, “Hear ye, hear ye!” every time you opened
eBay’s announcement boards. (Then again, if you were living in the 1700s,
you’d have no electricity, no computer, no fast food, or anything else you
probably consider fun.) In any case, eBay’s announcement boards are the
most important place to find out what’s going on (directly from headquar-
ters) on the Web site. And no one even needs to ring a bell.

You have your choice of two boards: the general announcement board and
the system announcement board. The general announcement board is where
eBay lists new features and policy changes. Visiting this page is like reading
your morning eBay newspaper, because eBay adds comments to this page
almost every day. You find out about upcoming changes in categories, new
promotions, and eBay goings-on. Reach this page by clicking the link or
going to the following

Figure 8-8 shows you eBay’s general announcement board with information
that could affect your auctions.
eBay reports outages and critical changes in policies and procedures on the
system announcement board, at the following address:
www2.ebay.com/aw/announce.shtml
eBay uses this board also to update users on glitches in the system and
when those may be rectified (should you wonder whether the problem is
on your computer or on the eBay system).
Whenever eBay introduces new features, explanations, or links, they appear
in the general announcement board, which is in the News area of the
Community Overview page.

Help! I need somebody
If you ever have specific eBay questions, several eBay discussion help
boards on the Community: Chat page can help you. You can also go directly
to the chat rooms to pose your question to the eBay members currently in
residence.
Boards work differently from chat rooms. Chat rooms are full of people who
are hanging out talking to each other at the same time. Users of discussion
boards, however, tend to go in, leave a message or ask a question, and pop
out again. Also, in a message board, you need to start a thread by asking a
question. Title your thread with your question, and you’ll no doubt get an
answer to your query posted swiftly. Take a look at the technical issues 
discussion board in Figure 8-9.
Most questions can be answered by going to eBay’s Answer Center, which
you can get to by clicking the Answer Center link in the Talk area. You then
see boards covering almost any topic you can think of regarding auctions on
eBay. Just post your question and some kind eBay member will probably
suggest an answer.
eBay newbies often find that the boards are good places to add to their
knowledge of eBay. As you scroll on by, read the Q & A postings from the
past; your question may already be answered in an earlier posting. You can
even ask someone on the board to look at your auction listing and provide
an opinion on your descriptions or pictures.

Community chat rooms
Because sending e-mail to eBay’s customer service people can be frustratingly
slow if you need an answer right away (they get bombarded with a gazillion
questions a day), you may want to try for a faster answer by posting your
question on one of the community message boards.
You can always tell whether an eBay staff member is replying on a board
because the top border line of his or her post is in pink (not gray, as with
regular users). They’ve earned the nickname “Pinks” on the boards.
Knowledgeable veteran eBay members or customer service “pinks” (if they’re
around) generally answer posted questions as best they can. The answers
are the opinions of members and are certainly not eBay gospel. Most ques-
tions are answered in about 15 minutes. If not, repost your question but
make sure you do so on the appropriate board; each board has a specific
topic of discussion.
Members who post on these boards often share helpful tips and Web sites
and alert other members to scams. Newbies may find that lurking (reading
without posting) on some of these boards helps them find out more about
how eBay works. Occasionally, an eBay staffer shows up, which is kinda like
inviting Bill Gates to a Windows XP new users meeting. eBay staff members
are usually hounded with questions.
Rating the member chat rooms and boards
You know you need help, but you don’t know
which area is best for you. Here’s my take on
which boards are most helpful:
 Auction listings: This discussion board is a
catchall for many subjects. If you don’t see
a board specific to your question (or if you
post to another board and get no reply), try
this one — it’s always hopping with lots of
peeps (people).
 Photos/HTML board and images/HTML
chat: Good help from other eBay members
for those with specific questions about
using HTML and posting pictures in your
auctions.
 Discuss eBay’s newest features chat: This
board (also known as DNF) is where you
find many of the folks devoted to protesting
eBay’s policies and new features. Brace
yourself — conversation on this board can
become nasty. Keep in mind, however, that
many of the regulars on this board are
extremely knowledgeable about eBay.
You can access a new board from any
other board by scrolling the drop-down list
at the top of each board page.

Book I
Chapter 8

151
If a new policy or some sort of big change occurs, the boards are most likely
going to quickly fill with discussion about it. On slow days, however, you
may need to wade through personal messages and chatting with no connec-
tion to eBay. Many of the people who post on these boards are longtime
members with histories (as well as feuds) that can rival any soap opera. On
rare occasions, the postings can get abusive. Getting involved in personality
clashes or verbal warfare gains you nothing.
No matter how peeved the users of a chat room or message board may get —
and no matter how foul or raunchy the language — no one on eBay ever sees
it. eBay uses a built-in vulgarity checker that deletes any (well, okay, as many
as possible) words or phrases that eBay considers offensive or obscene.
The one cardinal rule for eBay chat boards and message boards is: no busi-
ness. No advertising items for sale! Not now. Not ever. eBay bans any repeat
offenders who break this rule from participating on these boards.
User-to-user discussion boards
In addition to chat boards, eBay also has discussion boards, in which the
topics are deliberately open-ended — just as the topics of discussion in 
coffeehouses tend to vary depending on who happens to be in them at any
given time. Check out these areas and read ongoing discussions about
eBay’s latest buzz. It’s a lot of fun and good reading. Post your opinions to
the category that suits you. Here are few of my favorites:
✦The eBay Town Square: A potpourri of various subjects and topics.
✦The Soapbox: The place to voice your views and suggestions to help
build a better eBay.
✦Night Owls Nest: A fun locale for creatures of the night and their unique
postings. (As I’m writing this, for example, there’s a thread with spirited
advice to a community member who needs help with his “gassy” cat.)
✦The Park: An interesting place where community members join in for
fun ideas.
Other chat rooms (message boards)
About a dozen chat rooms on eBay specialize in everything from pure chat
to charity work. In this section, I describe a few of these boards.
Café society
The eBay Café (eBay’s first message board from back when eBay was mostly
selling Pez candy dispensers) and AOL Café message boards attract mostly
regulars chatting about eBay gossip. Frequent postings include the sharing
of personal milestones and whatever else is on people’s minds. You can also
find useful information about eBay and warnings about potential scams.

Emoticons: Communicating graphically
When you visit the eBay boards, you may notice that many experienced posters to the board have
cute little smiley icons, called emoticons, next to their posts to show emotion. The following table
shows how you too can doll up your posts with a little emotion.
You can type the keyboard shortcuts or use the HTML image links to display your chosen icon. Be
sure not to put spaces between the characters in the key combinations. Using HTML is pretty
easy; for example, <img 
src=”http://groups.ebay.com/images/emoticons/
blush.gif”> gets you the blushing smiley.

Holiday board
Although eBay suggests that this is the place to share your favorite holiday
memories and thoughts, it’s really a friendly place where people meet and
chat about home and family. Stop by for cybermilk and cookies next time
you have a few minutes and want to visit with your fellow auction addicts.
Giving board
eBay isn’t only about making money. On the Giving board, it’s also about
making a difference. Members in need post their stories and requests for
assistance. Other members with items to donate post offers for everything
from school supplies to clothing.
If you feel like doing a good deed, conduct a member benefit auction or
donate directly to those in need. For information on how to participate, 
visit the Giving board at www.givingboard.com.
Emergency contact board
The Emergency contact board is no Rescue 911, but if your computer crashes
and you lose all your info, this board is the place to put out an all-points bul-
letin for help. If your ISP goes on vacation, your phone line is on the fritz, or
you’re abducted by aliens and can’t connect to your buyers or sellers, use a
friend’s computer to post a message on the emergency contact board. A dedi-
cated group of eBay users frequent this board, and they will try to help you by
passing on your e-mails to the intended parties. Talk about a bunch of givers!

Recently, a bidder posted saying that her computer had crashed and that
she was in the process of moving. She asked her sellers to be patient and 
she would get to them as soon as possible. The friendly regulars of the 
emergency contact board looked up her bidding history and e-mailed the
sellers whose auctions she’d won in the last week. Then they forwarded her
the e-mails they’d sent on her behalf. The sellers understood the situation
and did not leave negative feedback for the lack of communication.
If you’re having trouble contacting other eBay members, posting for help
from other members to track ’em down often gets the job done.
If you think you may be the victim of a rip-off, check the emergency contact
board. The buyer or seller may have left word about an e-mail problem. On
the flip side, you may find out that you’re not alone in trying to track down
an eBay delinquent who seems to have skipped town. Posting information
about a potentially bad eBay guy is (at the least) bad manners on most
boards. If you wrap it in the guise of an emergency contact, however, you
can clue in other members about a potential problem. Stick to the facts and
make the post as honest and useful as you can.
To access the emergency contact board, follow these steps:
1. From the eBay navigation bar, click the Community link.
A subnavigation bar appears.
2. In the Talk area, click the Chat link.
You are now on the main Chat page.
3. Scroll down the Chat page and click Emergency Contact.
You see a board full of messages from all the desperate sellers and
buyers trying to locate each other.
eBay international chat boards
People from all around the world enjoy eBay. If you’re considering buying or
selling globally, visit the international boards. They’re a great place to post
questions about shipping and payments for overseas transactions. Along
with eBay chat, the international boards have discussions about current
events and international politics.

If you venture into unfamiliar foreign tongues, I suggest you keep things
simple. Don’t try to get fancy with your verbiage — stick to standard
phrases that can translate literally with minimum hassle.
Sharing knowledge in category-specific chat boards
Want to talk about Elvis, Louis XV, Sammy Sosa, or Howard the Duck? More
than twenty category-specific chat boards enable you to tell eBay members
what’s on your mind about merchandise and auctions. You reach these
boards by clicking Community on the main navigation bar and then clicking
Chat in the Talk area.
Discussions mainly focus on merchandise and the nuts and bolts of transac-
tions. Category-specific chat boards are great for posting questions on items
that you don’t know much about.
You’ll get all kinds of responses from all kinds of people. Take some of the
help you get with a grain of salt, because some of the folks who help you
may be buyers or competitors.
These boards are also great for finding out where to go for more information
and to conduct research on specific items. You can also find helpful sources
for shipping information about items in that category (such as large furni-
ture in the Antiques section or breakable items on the Glass chat board).
Don’t be shy. As your second-grade teacher said, “No questions are dumb.”
Most eBay members love to share their knowledge.
Joining eBay Groups
If you’re the friendly type and would like an instant group of new friends, I
suggest you click the eBay Groups link in the People area. Here you can find
thousands of user groups hosted on eBay but run by eBay community mem-
bers. They may be groups consisting of people from the same geographic
area, folks with similar hobbies, or those interested in buying or selling in
particular categories.
eBay groups may be public clubs (open to all) or private clubs (invited mem-
berships only) with their own private boards, accessible only by members of
the group.
Joining a group is easy: Just click any of the links on the main Groups page,
and you’re presented with a dizzying array of groups to join. Your best bet is
to participate in chats or discussions and find other members that you’d like
to join up with.

 Using the search engine
 Working with search results
 Finding eBay members
 Figuring out the category structure!
T
hink of walking into a store and seeing thousands of aisles of shelves con-
taining millions of items. Browsing the categories of auctions at eBay can
be just as pleasantly boggling, without the prospect of sore feet. Start surfing
around the site, and you instantly understand the size and scope of what’s
for sale. You may feel overwhelmed at first, but the clever eBay folks have
come up with lots of ways to help you find exactly what you’re looking for.
Working eBay’s Search Engine
Anyone can find an auction on eBay. Finding bargains or researching selling
prices accurately, on the other hand, requires some finesse. The key is
understanding how to search the site for hidden treasures. Just as knowing
how to browse the categories is important, knowing how to expertly work
the search engine will help you find your item for the lowest price.
The best part about shopping on eBay is that you can find just about every-
thing, from that esoteric lithium battery to new designer dresses (with
matching shoes) to pneumatic jackhammers. New or used, it’s all here —
lurking in the more than 13 million daily listings. But finding the nuggets
(deals) can be like searching for the proverbial needle in the haystack. The
search secrets in this chapter will put you head and shoulders above your
competition for the deals.
Going where the Search button takes you
One of the most important buttons on the eBay page is the Search button.
When you type some keywords and click this button, you’ll be presented
with a list of items matching your keywords on eBay.

Working eBay’s Search Engine

Should you want a more advanced type of search, click the Advanced Search
link below the Search button. You’re whisked to the main Search hub page,
which will have your search options in a box on the left side of the page, as
shown in Figure 1-1. Three categories of searches are available, and each
enables you to search for information in a different way.
Under the Items field, you can choose the following types of searches:
✦Find Items: Search by keywords or item number. Type the keywords that
describe an item (for example, Superman lunchbox or antique pocket watch)
and click Search, and you can see how many are available on eBay.
Tips to keep in mind before you search
When searching on eBay, don’t forget the 
following:
 Ignore capitalization of proper names:
eBay doesn’t care whether you capitalize.
In other words, the search engine doesn’t
distinguish between caps and noncaps.
 Don’t use noise words: and, a, an, or, or the
are called noise words. In searches, these
words are interpreted as part of your
search unless you enclose them in quotes.
Let’s say we want to find items from the
1939 classic film, Gone with the Wind. I got
2,209 hits from Gone with the Wind and
2,291 hits with a search for gone wind.
Many sellers drop the noise words from
their titles, so use as few keywords as you
can to expand your search.
 Don’t search just within specific categories:
Although a category-specific search nar-
rows your results, you also might miss 
a great deal of items. Take a look at
“Understanding eBay’s Category Hierarchy,”
later in this chapter.
 Think of possible synonyms: For example,
while searching for a ladies watch, I found
the following synonyms and abbreviations
for ladies: lady’s, ladys, lds, and femmes.
 Use the asterisk symbol to locate mis-
spellings: I’ve often found some great
deals by finding items incorrectly posted by
the sellers. Here are a few examples:
• Rodri*. In this search I look for items by the
famous Cajun artist George Rodrigue. His
Blue Dog paintings are world renowned
and valuable. By using this search, I man-
aged to purchase a signed Blue Dog litho-
graph for under $200. (I resold it on eBay
later that year for $900!)
• Alumi* tree. Remember the old aluminum
Christmas trees from the ’60s? They’ve had
quite a resurgence in popularity. You can
buy these “antiques” in stores for hundreds
of dollars, or you can buy one on eBay for
half the price. You can find them even
cheaper if the seller can’t spell aluminum.
• Cemet* plot. If you’re looking for that final
place to retire, eBay has some great deals.
Unfortunately, sellers haven’t narrowed
down whether they want to spell it ceme-
tery or cemetary. This search will find both.

✦Items by Seller: Every person on eBay has a personal user ID (the name
you use to conduct transactions). Use the Items by Seller search if you
liked the merchandise from a seller’s auction and want to see what else
the seller has for sale. Type the seller’s user ID, and you get a list of
every item that person is selling.
✦Items by Bidder: User IDs help eBay keep track of every move a user
makes at eBay. If you want to see what a particular user (say, a fellow
Star Trek fan) is bidding on, use the Items by Bidder search. Type a user
ID in the By Bidder search box, and you get a list of everything the user
is currently bidding on, as well as how much he or she is bidding.
✦By Item Number: Every item that’s up for auction on eBay is assigned 
an item number, which is displayed next to the item name on its page.
To find an item by number, just type the number and click Search.
The second search field is Stores. You can search by two options:
✦Items in Stores: eBay stores have their own search engine. Listings of
items in eBay stores will appear on a regular search for items only under
select circumstances.
✦Find Stores: If you know an eBay store name or description, you can
type a store name — or portion of a store name — and find the store
you’re looking for.
The final search area is Members:
✦Find a Member: Here you can type the user ID of any eBay member to
view his or her feedback profile, About Me page, or user ID history.
✦Find Contact Information: When you are in a transaction with someone,
you can type the person’s user ID and the number of the transaction to
receive an e-mail containing the phone number of your trading partner.
This works only if you have a current bid or have bought an item.

page.

Working eBay’s Search Engine
162
✦Find User ID: This is somewhat misleading. You can’t find another
member’s user ID here. Instead, if you type another member’s e-mail
address, you can find out whether the person is a registered member
of eBay and the member’s feedback score.
Performing a basic search
The basic search is where you land when you click the Advanced Search link
on any eBay page. I know, it sounds bizarre, but the basic search is a bit
more advanced than typing a few keywords into a box. You do have more
options.
At the bottom of the basic search (hidden in Figure 1-1 by the drop-down list)
is a link to more search options. That link leads you to the more thorough,
true advanced search.
When you click Advanced Search on any eBay page, you are brought to the
basic search page. On the basic search form you’ll see various boxes. You
can fill out some or all of them. The more information you type into this
form, the more concise your search can be.
To illustrate this, let’s do a basic search. Stumped on what words to use in
your search? Consider the item you’re trying to find. Look at it and deter-
mine which words best describe it. Suppose that your favorite china pattern
has been discontinued and you want to search eBay for some missing pieces.
To quickly find the pieces, follow this process:
1. Determine the manufacturer’s name.
I’m looking for a plate made by Dansk, so I turned over the plate to find
the manufacturer’s name.
If you don’t have all the information you need, check out the manu-
facturer’s Web site or a Web site that specializes in the item you’re 
looking for.
2. Determine the name for the series, collection, pattern, or design.
Sometimes an item has more than one name. For example, I’m searching
for Bistro (the name of the collection) and Maribo (the pattern name).
3. Narrow your search even further, if possible or necessary.
For example, I need to replace a salad plate.
4. Enter the words for your search.
I typed Dansk Bistro Maribo salad into the keyword box. If someone has
listed an item with all those words in the title, I’ll be lucky and pull up
some winners. However, it’s more likely that the words in your initial
search are buried in the description.

Book II
Chapter 1

on eBay

5. To enhance your search, ask the search engine to check both item
titles and item descriptions.
Select the check box next to Search Title and Description to open up
your search. You’ll get more hits if you select the Search Title and
Description check box, but you may also get too many items that are
out of your search range.
6. If you want, narrow your search by searching in a category.
Use the drop-down list to limit your search to a particular main (or top-
level) category, for example, instead of searching all eBay categories.
This might be a good idea if you know for sure where the item is listed.
But items often cross over different categories. For example, my salad
plates are probably listed in Home and Garden, but they could be listed 
in Pottery & Glass. I suggest leaving this option alone so your search
encompasses all categories. Sometimes sellers (when listing many items
at once) make mistakes and list in the wrong category. That’s when you
can find a real deal.
7. Tell eBay how you want the results arranged by using the drop-
down list.
For example, if you want to check out auctions in order of how soon
they’re closing, choose Items Ending Soonest. (This is my favorite 
option — you might miss the deal of the century while you’re sifting
through hundreds of listings in another order.) In the Sort By area,
choose one of the following options:
• Time: Ending Soonest: Auctions closing first appear at the top of the
results.
• Time: Newly Listed: The most recently posted auctions are listed
first.
• Price: Lowest First: Auctions are listed from the lowest priced bid to
the highest priced bid.
• Price: Highest First: Items are listed from highest to lowest priced.
(This is useful when you’re searching for a 1967 Camaro and you
want to buy a car, not a Hot Wheels toy.)
• Distance: Nearest First: If you’re looking for a bunny-style, wrought-
iron boot scraper or something as huge as a stove, you might want to
buy from a seller who is close by to save shipping costs (you may
even be able to pick up the item).
• Payment: PayPal First: The results that accept PayPal as payment
are listed first.
• Payment PayPal Last: This puts the PayPal items last in your results.

Working eBay’s Search Engine
164
8. Use the next drop-down list to select how you want to view the results.
Here you can choose whether you want to see all items, all items with
item number, or gallery items only. Why? I’m not sure. I always want to
see all the results I can, so I leave this on the default — All Items.
9. Select how many items you want to see on a page.
eBay searches default to 50 items per page. You may want to see more or
less depending on the speed of your connection. The options are 25, 50,
100, and 200.
10. After you’ve filled in all your search parameters, click the Search
button.
A list of auctions appears, in the order you selected in the Sort By area.
The eBay search engine is more sophisticated than ever. If you want to per-
form a superquick search by keyword or item number, just type it in any of
eBay’s search boxes throughout the site.
If you want to search completed items to get an idea of what the salad plate
has sold for before, select the check box next to Completed Listings Only.
This search returns results of items that have already ended. This is my
favorite search option on eBay. I use it as a strategic bidding and pricing
tool. How? If you’re bidding on an item and want to know whether the prices
are likely to go too high for your pocketbook, you can use this search option
to compare the current price of the item to the selling price of similar items
from auctions that have already ended. You can go back about two weeks.
Refining even the most basic search
You can refine your search even further by clicking the Advanced search link
at the bottom of the search page (see Figure 1-2). This link throws quite a
few more options into the package. Don’t be intimidated; you need to under-
stand just a few more bells and whistles.
All the options from the basic search page are available on the Advanced
Search page, plus a few more:
✦Exclude these words: If you’re looking for some silver flatware, and you
want it to be solid, not plated, you could type plated. That search would
exclude any item listings that contain the word plated.
✦Items Priced: Here’s where you can narrow your search to a specific
price range. I don’t recommend using this option because you never
know what you might miss.

✦From Specific Sellers: If you want to locate an item being sold by up to
ten sellers, you can type their user IDs here, separating each user ID by 
a comma or a space. If you want to find items excluding certain sellers,
click the drop-down list and list the offending sellers in the text box.
✦Location: You can elect to see your results from all items on eBay or you
can search by country.
• All Items Listed on eBay.com: Search all of eBay, no matter which
country.
• Items Available To: Select a country from the drop-down list 
and the search engine looks for items from sellers willing to ship
to that country.
• Items Located In: Use the drop-down box to find items from the
country you specified.
✦Currency: If you have a yen to pay for your item with a foreign currency,
you can search for sellers who accept the following:
• Any currency
• U. S. dollar
• Australian dollar
• Canadian dollar
• Euro
• Indian rupee
• New Taiwan dollar
• Pounds sterling
• Swiss franc

✦Multiple Item Listings: If you’re looking for a gaggle of stuffed geese, you
can input a number and indicate whether you want At Least, Exactly, or
At Most that many. You may alternatively indicate that you’re looking for
any listing listed as a lot.
Next, you can select to display only particular items:
✦Buy It Now items only: This option comes in handy when you simply
must purchase something immediately. This would work well for the
pair of tickets you’ve found to the Producers or when you’re about to run
out of your favorite moisturizer and don’t have time to make it to the
store within the next week to pick some up.
You can isolate Buy It Now items also by clicking the Buy It Now tab,
which appears at the top of the search results.
✦PayPal: You can isolate your search to only those sellers who accept
PayPal. This may enlighten you as to whether buyers of this product pay
higher prices if they have the option to pay with credit cards. (Although
the PayPal exclusion does not include other methods of credit card pay-
ments, it still speaks strongly for credit card users.)
✦Gift Items only: Yee-haa! If you need an item gift wrapped (and you don’t
want to see any other results), choose this option.
✦Locate Items Near You: If you’re selling or buying something big that
you can’t (or don’t want to) ship or pick up, this option allows you to
select a mileage range of 10 to 2000 miles. You may also type in a zip
code or select a popular city.
✦Items being sold for charitable organizations: If you’re looking for
items being sold only to benefit nonprofits, you may indicate that here.
Should you not want to go through this tedious, step-by-step check mark
thing every time you want to make a thorough search, you might want to
memorize the shortcuts in Table 1-1. These shortcuts can be typed in any
simple search box on any eBay page to get a specialized search.

Searching for items by seller
The next search option in the Items search area is to find items by seller.
After spending time on eBay, you’ll find that you have favorite sellers. You
can always access a seller’s other items for sale by clicking the View Seller’s
Other Items link on the listing page.
If you intend to follow the auctions of certain sellers, it’s a good idea to store
their links in your My eBay page. (For more on that, see Chapter 5.)
Here’s a way to see whether one of your competing sellers has an item like
yours up for sale:
1. Click the Items by Seller link.
2. On the resulting page, type the eBay user ID of the person you want to
find out about.
If you are a seller, trying to quickly get the e-mail address of one of your
bidders, select the Include Bidder’s Email Addresses check box. This
way, your results will come up showing your bidder’s e-mail addresses.
This option is only for sellers who want to search their own listings.
3. If you want to see auctions that this specific seller has conducted in
the past, select the Include Completed Listings option.

Working eBay’s Search Engine
168
You can choose to see all current and previous auctions, as well as auc-
tions that have ended in the last day, last two days, last week, last two
weeks, or past 30 days.
4. In the Sort By list (see Figure 1-3), select an option to control how you
want the results of your search to appear.
If you want to see the auctions that are closing right away, select Time
Ending Soonest.
5. Choose the number of results you want to see per page.
If the person you’re looking up has, for example, 100 auctions running,
you can limit the number of results to a manageable 25 listings on four
separate pages.
6. Click the Search button.
Searching for items by bidder
Also on the main search page is the Items by Bidder option. Sellers and
buyers alike use it when an auction is going on to figure out their strategies.
You may be wondering why you’d ever want to run a bidder search. Well,
when you’ve been outbid by the same person several times, you might not
need to ask that question. If you want an item badly enough, you’ll become
interested in the bidding patterns of others. (See Book 1, Chapter 6 for more
bargain-shopping secrets.)
When researching your competition, always check out the bidder’s completed
auctions as well as the times they’ve been outbid. This will give you a com-
plete grasp of their bidding modus operandi.

A bidder search is similar to a seller search, except you can add a few bid-
ding filters. You can select As High Bidder Only or Even If Not High Bidder if
you want to see every auction the bidder currently has a bid on, whether or
not the bidder is in the lead. To check completed listings as well as active
ones, put a check mark in the Include Completed Listings check box.
Searching stores
The next search link area allows you to search eBay Stores. If you look back
at Figure 1-3, you’ll see a Stores section on the left side of the page. You have
a couple of options when you search from this area:
✦Items in Stores: The search engine goes through all items listed in all
eBay stores to find your selected keywords in the item title. (Searching
eBay stores from the eBay search page allows you to search both item
titles and item descriptions as well as completed items.)
Understanding the icons
When you are presented with your search results, you may notice tiny icons next to some of the
items. Here’s a key to what those little pictures mean.
Icon
What It Means
The listing is new. The icon stays the first 24 hours an item is listed.
The seller has included a picture along with the item description, and you must 
open the item listing to see the picture.
The seller accepts PayPal as payment.
The transaction qualifies for PayPal’s buyer protection program.
The seller may perform gift services for that item, such as wrapping and shipping 
to another address.
The item is listed with a gallery photo (may show up in a category search). Gallery
photos are the small pictures of the item that you see next to a listing when you
run a search.
You may purchase the listing for a set price without having it go into an auction.
The item is being sold through a live auction. Click the item for more details.
The vehicle for sale has been inspected. This icon appears on the eBay Motors
site.

Working with Search Results
170
✦Find Stores: The search engine searches only the store names and the
brief store description posted by the seller.
When you run a search for an item on eBay, you’ll see a column of yellow
boxes on the left side of the results page. If you scroll down to the bottom,
you’ll see the heading More on eBay. This area offers links to eBay stores
that also carry the item you’re looking for.
Working with Search Results
With the growth of eBay, search results have become more and more com-
plex. The results page will give you lots of extra clues for narrowing your
quest and homing in on exactly what you want. This is especially handy
when you’ve performed your search through the small search boxes on most
eBay pages, rather than initiating your search from the “official” Search page
hub. Take a look at Figure 1-4, and note some of the important links.
At the top of the search results are tabs that can narrow your search in a
way that may better suit your shopping plans. You can use the tabs to sort
your results in three ways:
✦All Items: This is the default view of the results page and the best way to
see every item that matches your search.

✦Auctions: Click this tab if you want to see only items up for auction.
✦Buy It Now: If you’ve placed a search for an item that you want to buy
now, this is for you. Click this tab and you’ll see the items that match
your query that can be bought immediately.
You can also sort your results by listings ending soonest, newly listed items,
the lowest or highest price, the nearest location, and PayPal items first or
last. All these options are available on the main search page, but you can
sort on the results page as well.
More on eBay
When your search nets only a few items (like my search in Figure 1-3), eBay
will give you some help by adding some store results under “Some of the
matching items found in other eBay areas.” Below this headline, you’ll see
stores listed, along with the price they charge for items that match the
search.
Also, all eBay searches include links to stores that carry your item. These
links are in the More on eBay area (on the bottom left). You’ll also see a link
to all stores that match your search.
Matching categories
On the left side of the page, the top links are matching categories, which can
be very helpful. In the search in Figure 1-5, I’m looking for a brand of cosmet-
ics called Awake. Reviewing those 396 results would be time-consuming.
Figure 1-5:

Rather than going through the pages of results, I look at the category list on
the left, but I don’t see a category matching my quest for cosmetics. There
is, however, a See all categories link. I click that link and the screen shown in
Figure 1-6 appears, with a category that looks promising: Health and Beauty.
If I click the Health and Beauty category, I’ll have only 21 results. My search
results can be refined even further by choosing one of the subcategories
within Health and Beauty.
Search options
Below the Matching Categories area are check boxes that allow you to fur-
ther refine your search:
✦Items listed with PayPal: Isolates the listings that accept PayPal as a
payment method.
✦Buy It Now items: Accomplishes the same thing as clicking the Buy It
Now tab at the top of the results page.
✦Gift items: Click here to see items with little blue box icons, which indi-
cate that the seller thinks this a good gift item and has paid eBay extra
to let you know that.
✦Items listed as lots: Click this box when you’re looking for a lot, or group
of items sold in one listing.

✦Completed listings: The number one way to find out how much an item
has sold for on eBay. Click here to see the sales history over the past 
14 days.
✦Listings: Use the drop-down list to select the number of hours or days
you want reflected in your search:
• Started Within: Items that are newly listed on the site (catch the Buy
It Now deals before someone else does).
• Ending in More Than: If you want to participate in an auction that
closes in the future, make a selection here.
• Ending Within: Select how many hours you’d like to see items
ending within. It’s a turn on the old “going, going, gone” game that I
used to play with my daughter when we’d check out auctions about
to close and bid as they were closing. Note: Because the default sort
order shows items ending soonest at the top, you pretty much have
these results in front of you.
✦Items priced: Narrow your search within a specific price range.
✦Items within miles of a certain zip code: Your zip code is filled in by
default, but you can type in any zip code. You also select the mileage
from the drop-down list.
In the quest for even more minutia, a link at the bottom of this box allows
you to customize the search queries even further. You can definitely take a
good thing too far, and this is it.
Finding eBay Members
With millions of eBay users on the loose, you may think it’s hard to track
folks down. Nope. eBay’s powerful search engine kicks into high gear to help
you find other eBay members in seconds.
The search page also has links to find people or get info about them from
eBay:
✦Find a member: This link takes you to the main Find Members page,
where you can search for specific About Me pages. You can also look at
the feedback profile of a user and view user ID histories of fellow eBay
members.
✦Find contact information: If you’re involved in a transaction with some-
one, you can click this link to have the person’s phone number e-mailed
to you. Because this information is confidential, you must be involved in
a transaction with the person. You’ll be asked to type the other member’s
user ID and the transaction number you’re dealing with before this infor-
mation is sent out.

Understanding eBay’s Category Hierarchy

✦Find user ID: If you know a friend’s e-mail address, you can input it on
this page to find out whether he or she is registered on eBay.
To prevent Web robots from gleaning member information, you’ll have
to enter the provided security numbers before you get your information,
as shown in Figure 1-7. (Robots can’t do this — yet.)
The first nine of your favorite searches appear in a drop-down list on every
page in the search hub area.
Understanding eBay’s Category Hierarchy
Understanding eBay’s categories was a lot easier when there were just a few.
I remember thinking that the quantity of categories was daunting when the
site boosted the number up to the unthinkable 4000. Now that the total
number of categories is approaching the 20,000 mark, the time has come to
either abandon all hope of understanding them or to take things in hand and
appreciate the elegance and organization of a system that’s just beyond the
realm of comprehension. You may never totally understand the category
structure, but that’s okay — what’s important is knowing which categories
sellers use most frequently.
As I write this book, eBay is adding, combining, and subtracting categories
every two weeks to simplify the category structure. eBay works hard to keep
the site in an organized fashion, but the constant reorganizing that’s neces-
sary can be a little daunting for new users.
How the structure works
Go ahead, ask me what I’m interested in. Let’s see, I like art, golf, photography,
fashion — I won’t bore you with the rest, but it sounds like a fairly benign
list, doesn’t it? I’m sure your list of interests is straightforward too. Right?

Well, not quite. Say you like golf as much as I do. You might just click the
Sporting Goods category link on the home page, figuring you’ll find Golf on
the next page as a link.
Surprise! The Sporting Goods category is made up of approximately 2700
sub-, sub-sub-, and sub-sub-subcategories of everything from golf balls to
Pittsburgh Penguins jerseys. This hasn’t been done to confuse you. It’s just
that there are so many areas that your sports interest might take you. To
accommodate the countless auctions that sports aficionados, collectors, and
participants list, eBay had to create a lot of small areas.
Drilling down to your item
Depending on what you’re looking for, things can get confusing. For example,
suppose I want to find a category with items relating to my dog, a somewhat
obscure breed called schipperke. You might think I have it made. I mean,
how could a category for such an esoteric breed of dog be anything but very
simple?
Schipperkes have their own category in the main category of Collectibles on
eBay. (eBay has categories in Collectibles for more than 80 breeds of dogs.)
Currently, 3 schipperke items are listed in the category.
But there are more auctions. When I ran a title search on Schipperke, I came
up with 101 items. When I selected the check box to include descriptions,
I got 124 listings. When I followed my own advice (earlier in this chapter)
and entered a search for schipperk*, I found 129 items. When I searched for
shipperke (misspelled), I found 2 more.
Items for schipperke (and its misspellings) were listed in all these categories:
Collectibles: Animals: Dog: Schipperke
Collectibles: Animals: Dog: Other Dogs
Collectibles: Animals: Dog: Corgi
Collectibles: Animals: Dog: Poodle

I hope you realize where I’m going with all this. Even though I chose an
arcane item, searching only through the specific category designated for it
would have affected my search significantly. I would have missed some of
the more interesting items.

f you don’t know what your item is worth, as a seller you may not get the
highest price. If you don’t know how to make your item easy to find, it
may not be noticed by even the hardiest of collectors. If you don’t know the
facts or what to say, your well-written title and detailed description (com-
bined with a fabulous picture) may still not be enough to get the highest
price for your item.
Knowing your item is a crucial part of successful selling on eBay. An item
may be appraised or listed in a book for a high value, but what you care
about is the price at which the item will actually sell. Imagine someone
uncovering a hoard of your item and, not knowing the value of it, dumping it
on eBay with low Buy It Now prices. This scenario would drive down the
value of the item within a couple of weeks. Great for buyers — but not so
great for sellers.
The best advice you can follow as you explore any free-market system is
caveat emptor — let the buyer beware. Although you can’t guarantee that
every one of your transactions will be perfect, if you research items thor-
oughly before you bid, you won’t lose too much of your hard-earned 
money — or too much sleep.
Researching Collectible Auctions
If you’re just starting out on eBay, chances are you like to shop and you also
collect items that interest you. You’ll find out early in your eBay adventures
that a lot of people online know as much about collecting as they do about
bidding — and some are serious contenders.

Understanding grading terms
Welcome to my version of grade school without the bad lunch. One of the keys to establishing
value is knowing an item’s condition, typically referred to as an item’s grade. The following table
lists the most common grading categories that collectors use. The information in this table is used
with permission from (and appreciation to) Lee Bernstein (www.elee.com).

Grading is subjective. Mint to one person may be Very Good to another. Always ask a seller to
define the meaning of the terms used. Also, be aware that many amateur sellers may not really
know the different definitions of grading and may arbitrarily add Mint or Excellent to their item
descriptions.

How can you compete? Well, in addition to having a well-planned bidding
strategy (covered in Book I, Chapter 6), knowing your stuff gives you a win-
ning edge. I’ve gathered the opinions of two collecting experts to get the info
you need about online collecting basics. I also show you how one of those
experts puts the information into practice, and I give you a crash course on
how items for sale are (or should be) graded.
The values of collectibles go up and down. Star Wars items are a perfect
example. Values skyrocketed during the release of the latest movie, but 
then settled to a considerably lower level. A published book of value listings
is valid only for the moment the book is written. If you stay on top of your
market in a few specialties, you’ll be aware of these market fluctuations. If
you’re looking for the highest price for Star Wars items, for example, instead
of looking to liquidate excess inventory, I’d hold those items until the next
film is released.
Buying collectibles on eBay can be a unique market unto itself. But still, 
certain rules apply. Here are a few things to keep in mind when buying col-
lectibles on eBay:
✦Get all the facts before you put your money down. Study the descrip-
tion carefully and make your bidding decisions accordingly. Find out
whether all original parts are included and whether the item has any
flaws. If the description says that the Fred Flintstone figurine has a
cracked back, e-mail the seller for more information.
✦Don’t get caught up in the emotional thrill of bidding. First-time
buyers (known as Under-10s or newbies because they have fewer than
ten transactions under their belts) tend to bid wildly, using emotions
instead of brains. If you’re new to eBay, you can get burned if you just
bid for the thrill of victory without thinking about what you’re doing.
I can’t stress how important it is to determine an item’s value. But
because value is such a flighty thing (depending on supply and demand,
market trends, and all sorts of other cool stuff), I recommend that you get
a general idea of the item’s value and use this ballpark figure to set a max-
imum amount of money you’re willing to bid for that item. Then stick to
your maximum and don’t even think about bidding past it. If the bidding
gets too hot, there’s always another auction. To find out more about bid-
ding strategies, Book I, Chapter 6 is just the ticket.
✦Know what the item should cost. Buyers used to depend on price 
guides — books on collectibles and their values — to help them bid. 
But price guides are becoming a thing of the past. Sure, you can find a
guide that says a Lion King Broadway poster in excellent condition has a
book price of $75, but if you do a search on eBay, you’ll see that they’re
actually selling for $20 to $30.

Researching Collectible Auctions
180
When your search on eBay turns up what you’re looking for, average the
completed prices that you find. Doing so gives you a much better idea
than any price guide of what you need to spend.
✦Timing is everything, and being first costs. In the movie-poster busi-
ness, if you can wait three to six months after a movie is released, you
get the poster for 40 to 50% less. The same goes for many new releases
of collectibles. Sometimes you’re wiser to wait and save money.
✦Be careful of presell items. You may run across vendors selling items
that they don’t have in stock at the moment but that they’ll ship to you
later. For example, before the second Harry Potter film came out, some
vendors ran auctions on movie posters they didn’t have yet. If you had
bid and won, and for some reason the vendor had a problem getting the
poster, you’d have been out of luck. Don’t bid on anything that can’t be
delivered as soon as your check clears.
✦Being too late can also cost. Many collectibles become more difficult to
find as time goes by. Generally, as scarcity increases, so does desirability
and value. Common sense tells you that if two original and identical col-
lectibles are offered side by side, with one in like-new condition and the
other in used condition, the like-new item will have the higher value.
✦Check out the seller. Check the seller’s feedback rating (the number in
parentheses next to the person’s user ID) before you buy. If the seller
has many comments with very few negative ones, chances are good that
this is a reputable seller.
If you miss winning an auction and are offered a side deal, beware! Side
deals off the eBay site are strictly prohibited. If you conduct a side deal
and are reported to eBay, you can be suspended. Not only that, but
buyers who are ripped off by sellers in away-from-eBay transactions
shouldn’t look to eBay to bail them out. They’re on their own. Second
chance offers, on the other hand, are eBay legal and safer.
Quizzing the seller
You should ask the seller certain questions when making a collectible pur-
chase. Assume that the object of your desire is a collectible GI Joe action
figure from 1964 to 1969. In this section, I list some questions you should
ask. The information here can give you an idea of what to ask when deter-
mining your maximum bid on other collectibles as well (or whether an item
is even worth bidding on). As you imagine, the more you know before you
place a bid, the happier you’re likely to be when you win.
This checklist can save you considerable hassle:
✦Find out the item’s overall condition. For GI Joe, look at the painted
hair and eyebrows. Expect some wear, but overall, a collectible worth
bidding on should look good.

Book II
Chapter 2
Researching 
on the Web
Researching Collectible Auctions
181
✦Be sure the item’s working parts are indeed working. Most GI Joe
action figures from this period have cracks on the legs and arms, but the
joints should move and any cracks should not be so deep that the legs
and arms fall apart easily.
✦Ask whether the item has its original parts. Because you can’t really
examine actual items in detail before buying, e-mail the seller with spe-
cific questions relating to original or replacement parts. Many GI Joe
action figures are rebuilt from parts that are not from 1964 to 1969.
Sometimes the figures even have two left or right hands or feet! If you
make it clear to the seller before you buy that you want a toy with only
original parts, you’ll be able to make a good case for a refund if the item
arrives rebuilt as the Six Million Dollar Man.
✦Ask whether the item has original accessories. A GI Joe from 1964 to
1969 should have his original dog tags, boots, and uniform. If any of
these items are missing, you will have to pay around $25 to replace each
missing item. If you’re looking to bid on any other collectible, know what
accessories came as standard equipment with the item.
✦Know an item’s value before you bid. A 1964 to 1969 vintage GI Joe
in decent shape, with all its parts, sells for around $200 without its 
original box. If you are bidding on a GI Joe action figure and are in
this price range, you’re okay. If you get the item for less than $175,
congratulations — you’ve nabbed a bargain.
✦If you have any questions, ask them before you bid. Check collectors’
guides, research similar auctions on eBay, and visit one of eBay’s category
chat rooms.
Hey, experts have been buying, selling, and trading collectible items for
years. But just because you’re new to eBay doesn’t mean you have to be a
newbie for decades before you can start bartering with the collecting gods. 
I wouldn’t leave you in the cold like that — and neither would eBay. You can
get information on items you’re interested in, as well as good collecting tips,
right on the eBay Web site. Visit the category-specific discussion boards in
the Community area. You can also search the rest of the Web or go the old-
fashioned route and check the library.
Keep in mind that there truly are several prices for an item. The retail (or
manufacturer’s suggested retail price — MSRP) price, the book value, the
secondary market price (the price charged by resellers when an item is
unavailable on the primary retail market), and the eBay selling price. The
only way to ascertain the price an item will go for on eBay is to research
completed auctions.
Useful publications
So what if your item isn’t for sale on eBay and hasn’t been for 14 days?
What’s the first thing to do? Check out your local newsstand for one of the

Web sites
Many Web sites devoted to different collectible areas list prices at recently
completed auctions. These auctions are the best evaluation of an item’s
value because they’re usually directed toward specialists in the collectible
category. Most of the participants in these auctions really know their stuff.
You may have to poke around the following Web sites to find the prices real-
ized at auction, but once you do, you’ll have the holy grail of estimated values.
Look for links that point to auction archives. Many of these sites will consign
your item from you as well and sell it to their audience:
✦Antiques, art, all kinds of rare stuff: www.sothebys.com
✦Art auctions: www.artprice.com (charges for its searches by artist, but
has an immense database)
✦Autographs, movie posters, and comic books: www.autographs.com
✦Sports memorabilia: www.collectors.com
✦Collectible advertising glasses: www.pgcaglassclub.com (you’ve got to
see this stuff!)
✦United States coin price guide: www.pcgs.com/prices/
✦Currency auctions: www.lynknight.com
✦Rock and roll memorabilia (home of the world’s rarest records): www.
goodrockintonight.com
✦Rare coins: www.bowersandmerena.com
✦Sports memorabilia and cards: www.superiorsports.com
If you’re researching prices to buy a car on eBay, look in your local news-
paper to get a good idea of prices in your community. You should also check
out sites on the Internet. I’ve had many of my friends (and editors) visit the
various sites, and we’ve settled on www.nadaguides.com because it seems
to give the most accurate and unbiased information.
Online search engines
If you don’t find the information you need on eBay, don’t go ballistic — just
go elsewhere. Even a site as vast as eBay doesn’t have a monopoly on infor-
mation. The Internet is filled with Web sites and Internet auction sites that
can give you price comparisons and information about cyberclubs.
Your home computer can connect to powerful outside servers (really big
computers on the Internet) that have their own fast-searching systems
called search engines. Remember, if something is out there and you need it,
you can find it right from your home PC in just a matter of seconds. Here are

Book II
Chapter 2

the addresses of some of the Web’s most highly regarded search engines or
multi-search-engine sites:
✦AltaVista (www.altavista.com)
✦Dogpile (www.dogpile.com)
✦Google (www.google.com)
✦MSN (www.msn.com)
✦Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com)
The basic process of getting information from an Internet search engine is
pretty simple:
1. Type the address of the search-engine site in the Address box of your
Web browser.
You’re taken to the Web site’s home page.
2. Find the text box next to the button labeled Search or something 
similar.
3. In the text box, type a few words indicating what interests you.
Be specific when typing search text. The more precise your entry, the
better your chances of finding what you want. Look for tips, an advanced
search option, or help pages on your search engine of choice for more
information about how to narrow your search.
4. Click the Search (or similar) button or press Enter on your keyboard.
The search engine presents you with a list of how many Internet pages
have the requested information. The list includes brief descriptions and
links to the first group of pages. You’ll find links to additional listings at
the bottom if your search finds more listings than can fit on one page
(and if you ask for something popular, like Harry Potter, don’t be sur-
prised to get millions of hits).
Always approach information on the Web with caution. Not everyone is
the expert he or she would like to be. Your best bet is to get lots of differ-
ent opinions and then boil ’em down to what makes sense to you. And
remember — caveat emptor. (Is there an echo in here?)
Online appraisals
I’ve had a bit of experience with online appraisals, which seem tempting at
first glance. At second glance, though, I realized that unless the person doing
the appraisal could actually see and feel the item, an accurate appraisal
couldn’t be performed. Also, you have no guarantee that the person at the
other end is really an expert in the field that relates to your item.

Online Sources of Information
186
I had a few items e-appraised by a prestigious (and now defunct) online
appraisal company, and the appraisals seemed a bit off. I then took one
item, a painting, to Butterfields (now Bonhams) in Los Angeles and found
that the value of the painting was ten times what my e-appraisal read.
The bottom line here is that if you have an item of real value that’s worth
appraising, it’s worth getting appraised in person. Most large cities have auc-
tion houses, and many of those auction houses have monthly consignment
clinics (a way for auction houses to get merchandise for their future auc-
tions). If you bring an item to the auction house, you aren’t legally bound to
have the auction house sell your item for you (but it may not be a bad idea).
All you’ll get is a free verbal appraisal; the auction house won’t fill out any
official paperwork or anything, but at least you’ll get an idea of what your
item is worth. Real appraisals are expensive, performed by licensed profes-
sionals, and accompanied by a formal appraisal document.
Authentication services
Some companies provide the service of authenticating (verifying that it’s the
real deal) or authenticating and grading (determining a value based on the
item’s condition and legitimacy). To have these services performed on your
items, you’ll have to send them to the service and pay a fee.
Following are a few excellent sites for grading coins:
✦Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS): www.pcgs.com.
✦American Numismatic Association Certification Service (AMNACS) —
sold to Amos Press in 1990: www.anacs.com.
✦Numismatic Guaranty Corporation of America (NGCA): www.ngccoin.
com/ebay_ngcvalue.cfm. The site offers eBay users a discount and fea-
tures a mail-in grading and certification service for your coins.
✦PCI Coin Grading Service (PCI): www.pcicoins.com.
To catch up on the latest pricing on American coins, go to www.pcgs.com
(Figure 2-2). This site has an elaborate online price guide for all coin grades.
Stamp collectors (or those who have just inherited a collection from Uncle
Steve) can get their stamps “expertized” (authenticated) by the American
Philatelic Society. Visit www.stamps.org/services/ser_about
expertizing.htm for more information.
For comic books, Comics Guaranty, LLC (CGC), at https://www.cgccomics.
com/ebay_comic_book_grading.cfm, will seal (enclose in plastic to preserve
the quality) and grade at a discount for eBay users.

You can find the links to authentication discounts for eBay users at pages.
ebay.com/help/community/auth-overview.html.
Sports cards and sports memorabilia have a bunch of authentication services.
If you got your autograph or memorabilia direct from the player or team, you
can assure its authenticity. Having the item authenticated may or may not
get you a higher price at eBay. Try these sites:
✦Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA): www.psacard.com/cobrands/
submit.chtml?cobrandid=23. Offers eBay users a discount.
✦Online Authentics: www.onlineauthentics.com. Reviews autographs
by scans online or by physical review.
The best way to find a good authenticator in your field is to search the items
on eBay and see who is the most prominent authenticator listed in the
descriptions. For example, in the coins area, coins from certain grading serv-
ices get higher bids than those from other services. You can also go to an
Internet search engine (such as Google or Yahoo!) and type the keywords
coin grading (for coins). You’ll come up with a host of choices; use your good
sense to see which one suits your needs.
Remember that not all items need to be officially authenticated. Official
authentication does add value to the item, but if you’re an expert, you can
comfortably rate an item on your own in your auctions. People will know
from your description whether you’re a specialist. Your feedback will also
work for you by letting the prospective bidder or buyer know that your mer-
chandise from past sales has been top-drawer.

 Writing to the seller
B
usiness, bah! eBay’s supposed to be fun! But business is business and if
you’re in business, you must remember that your customers are number
one. Businesses become successful by providing fantastic customer service
and selling quality merchandise. You have to move in the same direction.
The image that you project through your e-mails and listings identifies you
to bidders as a good guy or a bad guy. No kidding. Your e-mails should be
polite and professional. Your listings shouldn’t make prospective buyers feel
like you’re hustling them, sneaking in hidden fees, or being pushy with severe
rules for bidding.
You don’t have to have the most beautiful auctions on eBay to succeed.
Instead, you need products that sell and you need to take the time to build
good customer relations! This is what gives the little guy the advantage over
the mega-company that branches onto eBay. In this chapter, I cover some
ways — from writing effective auction descriptions to sending cordial
e-mails — to let your customers know that they’re number one in your book.
Communicating with Your Customers
Perhaps English class wasn’t your favorite, but good grammar, proper spelling,
and punctuation in your communications portray you as a pro. Before writ-
ing this book, even I hooked up with some grammar and punctuation sites
to brush up on my writing skills. (Okay, I also have brilliant editors covering
up my transgressions. . . .)
Throughout the rest of this section, I provide some examples of effective
e-mails. Study these and also check out a few business letter books, such as

Communicating with Your Customers
190
Writing Business Letters For Dummies by Sheryl Lindsell-Roberts (published
by Wiley). And don’t forget good manners. You don’t want to be too formal,
but you do want to be personable and polite.
Initial inquiry through eBay’s e-mail service
The first written communication you might have with a prospective buyer is
an inquiry e-mail. A bidder can ask you a question about your item by clicking
the Ask the seller a question link on the auction or sale page, which generates
an e-mail addressed to you, as shown in Figure 3-1. Often these questions are
brief.
At least 20% of the time that I send an inquiry to a seller, I don’t get a
response — guaranteeing that I won’t be buying that product. I refuse to 
buy from someone who doesn’t even care to respond to a question. When 
I do get responses, more often than not it’s a terse, brusquely written note.
Many people choose not to use punctuation or capitalization in their e-mails.
How professional looking is that? Not very. Sellers who take the time to write
a short, considerate reply that includes a greeting and a thank you for writ-
ing get my money.
You should respond quickly, clearly, and politely — and with a sales pitch
whenever possible. Remind the soon-to-be bidder that you can combine sev-
eral wins to save on shipping costs. And by all means, use this opportunity

to point out other auctions you have that may also interest the writer. Now
that’s customer service.
When a prospective buyer or bidder has a question, you will know about it
in two ways: through e-mail and as a clickable link on your My eBay page.
You’ll get the e-mail from eBay alerting you that a question has been asked.
Using this service goes a long way to protect your privacy. In the past, your
only option was to respond through your regular e-mail, thereby revealing
your e-mail address to a stranger.
Now you can click the Respond Now button in the e-mail and go directly to
the online question to post your response, as shown in Figure 3-2.
Type your answer and indicate whether you want the reply posted on the
page for other prospective customers to see. You can also indicate that your
personal e-mail address should be withheld from your reply mailed to the
questioner from eBay’s mail server. If you’re in a hurry and need to make a
short, factual reply, this is an excellent option — but it doesn’t give you the
punch that a personal e-mail can.
You can also go directly to the item page, where you’ll see the notice that
you have a question to answer (see Figure 3-3). Click the link and you’ll be
brought to the page where you can respond to the question (the same page
the e-mail links to).

If you’ve responded to a question and indicated that you want it posted on
the item page, the response to your question will appear at the bottom of
your description, as shown in Figure 3-4.
When answering a question, a brief and straightforward response is good.
For example, I wrote the following note in response to a question regarding
the condition of the Christmas tree in one of my auctions:
Hello,
Yes, the aluminum Christmas tree in my auction is in excellent condition. The
58 branches are full and lush and will look great for the holidays. Please write
again if you have any more questions or concerns.
Don’t forget to check my other auctions for a color wheel and a revolving tree
turner. They would look great with this tree, and I can combine them for shipping.
Thank you for writing,

Isn’t that nice? The note addresses the question in a respectful and personable
manner. Writing a note like this doesn’t take long. You should be doing it.
Putting your Web site or eBay store URL in your signature is a great way to
get new customers to view your other merchandise.
The winner’s notification letter
Have you ever received a bulk-generated boilerplate winner’s confirmation
letter? The seller hasn’t bothered to fill in half the blanks, and you’re almost
insulted just by reading it? Receiving a note like this after you’ve requested
that the seller combine purchases (and the letter pays no attention to your
request) is especially annoying. E-mails can cross, but a personal approach
goes a long way with customers.
I’m not saying you shouldn’t automate your eBay business. I’m merely 
suggesting — strongly recommending — that you take the time to personal-
ize even your canned e-mail responses. If you decide to send automated
responses, choose a program (such as eBay’s Selling Manager, described 
in Chapter 5) that allows you to customize your e-mail, combine multiple
wins, and apply the correct shipping costs the first time.
Here’s the tried and true winner’s notice that I send out:
Congratulations!
Yours was the winning bid on eBay item #122342911 for the Emilio Pucci book.
You got a great deal! I am looking forward to a pleasant transaction and posi-
tive feedback for both of us.
Please include a copy of this e-mail with your name and shipping address along
with your payment:

You may pay by money order, with a personal check, or with a credit card
through PayPal. If you are not set up with PayPal, just e-mail me and I’ll send
you a PayPal invoice so you can set up an account.
A money order or online payment assures immediate shipping upon receipt
of payment! If you pay by check, I will ship your item after a 14-day clearing

ment. Please send your payment to the address shown below:

Your payment is expected on or before Saturday, April 2, 2005. I look forward to
receiving it. I will ship on receipt of payment in full, via U.S. priority mail with
delivery confirmation.
Thank you for your Winning Bid! I am delighted to be dealing with you and
know you will enjoy your purchase.

At the end of a winner’s notice letter, offer your winner some special dis-
counts or other offers from your Web site. Include a few items this particular
winner may be interested in (based on the current win) and include a link to
your site. Also include the reminder that you can combine postage and that
you look forward to a response.
You can send an invoice also from your My eBay page. Just click the gray
Send Invoice bar in the Items I’ve Sold area, verify all the information, and
click Send Invoice. If you select the Copy Me check box on this invoice, you’ll
receive a copy. The buyer’s copy has a link, enabling the buyer to pay directly
through PayPal (if you accept it for payment). Figure 3-5 shows what the
invoice e-mail looks like.
Let’s keep e-mailing
If you’ve got a good transaction going (and the majority of them are good),
the buyer will reply to your e-mail within three business days. (Most replies
come the next day.) If your buyer has questions regarding anything you
asked in your e-mail, you’ll get those inquiries now. Most of the time, all you
get back is, “Thanks. Payment on the way.” Hey, that’s good enough for me.
If any last-minute details need to be worked out, usually the buyer asks to
set up a time to call or requests further instructions about the transaction.
Respond to this communication as soon as possible. If you can’t deal with it
at the moment, let the buyer know you’re working on it and will shoot those
answers back ASAP. Never let an e-mail go unanswered.

As soon as you get the hang of sending e-mail, you can add an eBay link that
takes the buyer right to the Feedback Forum with just a click of the mouse.
Buyers and sellers can also get to the Feedback Forum from the final auction
page by clicking the Leave Feedback link.

SquareTrade seal member letter
If you subscribe to the SquareTrade seal (see

pleasant letter to your buyers on your behalf
every time you make a sale. A portion of that
e-mail is shown in the figure.

The payment reminder
Writing a payment reminder can get sticky. You don’t want to aggravate the
buyer, but time is wasting and you could spend this time reposting your
item. When writing a payment reminder, you need to be firm but pleasant.
Real things can happen in people’s lives. Family members get sick, people
just plain forget, or perhaps your payment fell between the seats of the
winner’s car on the way to the post office. (That was my excuse when I
forgot to mail a payment — feel free to use it.)
When you honestly forget to send a payment, nothing is more humiliating
than someone debasing you through e-mail. So remember that people do
make mistakes, and check the winner’s feedback before you send the letter.
If you can garner from the feedback that this winner has a habit of not fol-
lowing through on bids, you can definitely be a bit firmer in your wording.
Always set a clear deadline for receiving payment, as shown in the following
letter:
Hello,
You won an auction of mine on eBay last week for the Emilio Pucci book. Your
payment was due yesterday and it still has not arrived. Perhaps sending pay-
ment has slipped your mind considering your busy schedule. I know it can
easily happen.
Please e-mail back within 48 hours and let me know whether you want to go
through with our transaction. I’d like to put the item back up for sale if you
don’t want it.
Thank you for your bid,
Marsha Collier
How firm you choose to get with a nonpaying bidder is up to you. I’ve dealt
with a few nonpaying bidders on eBay, but I’ve left only two negative feed-
backs. Some people who tend to overbid are indeed violating the contract 
to buy, but legitimate reasons might explain why someone hasn’t followed
through on an auction. You must decide which method to take and how far
you want to stretch your karma (what goes around comes around). Assess
each case individually, and don’t be hasty in leaving negative feedback until
you know the whole story.
The payment received and shipping notice
I know that you probably aren’t going to send out a payment received letter
for every transaction, but it would surely be nice if you did. Staying in 

Book II
Chapter 3
Efficient

for Better Sales
Communicating with Your Customers
197
constant communication with your buyers will make them feel more secure
with you and with buying on eBay. You want them to come back, don’t you?
When you receive payment and are ready to ship, sending a short note like
the following helps to instill loyalty in your customer:
Hi there (insert name of winner),
Your payment was received and your item will ship tomorrow. Please e-mail me
when it arrives so that I can hear how pleased you are with your purchase.
When the transaction is over, I hope you will leave positive feedback for me
because building a good reputation on eBay is very important. I’d really appre-
ciate it, and I’ll be glad to do the same for you.
Thank you for bidding & winning,
Marsha_c

If you haven’t heard from the buyer within a week, send another note.
Say thank you — I mean it! What do all the successful big-name department
stores have in common? Yes, great prices, good merchandise, and nice 
displays. But with all things being equal, customer service always wins
hands-down. One department store in the United States, Nordstrom, has
such a great reputation that the store happily took back a set of snow tires
because a customer wasn’t happy with them. No big deal, maybe — until
you notice that Nordstrom doesn’t even sell snow tires!
The “Your item is on the way” e-mail
You can always send the automatic e-mail from your shipper announcing 
the shipment tracking number. I prefer sending the e-mail from PayPal (see
Chapter 4) by inserting the tracking number into the PayPal payment record.
This way you cover two bases: Your buyer is notified of shipping, and PayPal
has the record that you’ve shipped an item. PayPal sends an e-mail like the
one shown in Figure 3-6.
These e-mails aren’t very personalized, so I follow up through eBay’s Selling
Manager program, with another, more personal note:
Subject: Your book is on the way!

Communicating with the Seller
198
Hi (insert buyer’s name)!
You will be receiving another e-mail with the package’s delivery confirmation
number and information on the mode of shipment.
Thank you for buying my item. If there is any question when the package
arrives, PLEASE e-mail me immediately. Your satisfaction is my goal, and I’m
sure any problem can be easily taken care of. Please let me know when the
package arrives so that we can exchange some very positive feedback!

Communicating with the Seller
Top-notch sellers know that communication is the key to a successful trans-
action, and they do everything they can to set a positive tone for the entire
process with speedy and courteous e-mails.
A good e-mail from a professional eBay seller should include the following
information:
✦Confirmation of the winning price
✦The address for sending payment or a phone number for credit card 
processing
✦A review of the shipping options and price (the fee you pay)
Figure 3-6:
PayPal’s

Book II
Chapter 3
Efficient
Communications 
for Better Sales

199
✦Confirmation of escrow (if offered in the auction)
✦The date the item will be shipped
When you read the seller’s e-mail, be sure to compare the terms the seller
laid out in his or her e-mail with those on the auction page. If you see signifi-
cant differences, address them immediately with the seller — before you
proceed with the transaction. And make sure that the form of payment and
where it should be sent are clear.
When you e-mail the seller a reply, you should do the following:
✦Let the seller know what form of payment you’re using. For info on pay-
ment options, see Book I, Chapter 7.
✦Include your address, name, and user ID.
✦Include the item’s title and number so that the seller knows what you’re
referring to and can get your item ready to ship as soon as the payment
arrives.
✦Include your phone number if you plan to pay with a credit card. If
there’s a problem with the credit card number you’ve given, the seller
can contact you promptly to let you know.
✦Request that the seller e-mail you any shipping information, such as
tracking numbers and an approximate arrival date.

n the early days of eBay, online auctions were a scary place. You could
send a check to your trading partner, but the wait for the product could
be interminable. There was little feedback in the beginning, so you couldn’t
separate the good sellers from the bad. The most widely accepted form of
payment was the money order. Somehow, in our small (but growing) com-
munity, we weren’t afraid to send money orders to strangers. Heck, some
sellers even shipped merchandise before they received payment! Things
were a lot simpler, if riskier, in the old days.
Then, rising like a beacon on the horizon, came x.com. A bright man named
Elon came up with the concept of e-mailing money; you could even beam
cash to someone’s Palm Pilot! There was no charge for using this service,
which was even more amazing! The best part about signing up for the pro-
gram was that they gave you a $10 credit just to join. You also received a $10
bonus for each friend you got to join. (The maximum any user could get in
bonuses was $1000, but hey, that’s no small change!)
With numbers like that, the early eBay née AuctionWeb crowd signed up
quickly. x.com quickly became the most widely used service on the Internet,
the first mover-and-shaker in online, person-to-person payments.
eBay countered, acquiring Billpoint in the spring of 1999 in the hopes of
launching their own payment service in a partnership with Wells Fargo. In a
disaster of bad timing, the service was not available to eBay members until
the second quarter of 2000. Meanwhile, x.com — now reborn as PayPal —
was growing by leaps and bounds and quietly taking over the market.
PayPal went public in February of 2002 to an encouraging Wall Street. The
feud between PayPal and Billpoint heated up. The number of customers
who signed up with Billpoint couldn’t keep pace with the numbers joining
PayPal. PayPal posted a profit, while Billpoint was losing millions per year.

Understanding How PayPal Works
202
In October 2002, eBay bit the bullet and acquired PayPal in a deal valued at
$1.5 billion. Billpoint was then simply phased out of the site.
If you’ve read any of my other books, you know that I’ve been a huge fan of
PayPal from the beginning. PayPal is one of the safest and least expensive
ways for a vendor to accept money over the Internet. For a small retailer,
PayPal fees can be much more cost effective than a credit card merchant
account (as I explain in the next section).
Understanding How PayPal Works
Joining PayPal is just the beginning. No, they don’t give $10 bonuses for
signups any more, but the benefits far outweigh any fees they charge to sell-
ers. Also, there’s no charge to send money to anyone. As of this writing,
small sellers can still accept money from eBay sales and not incur any fees.
Before planning on a free ride from PayPal, double-check the PayPal Web
site, www.PayPal.com, for any changes in fees and policies.
You may register up to eight e-mail addresses with a PayPal account.
However, you may not register an e-mail address that is already registered
with another PayPal account.
Sending money through PayPal
You can fund the money you send to another party through PayPal in several
ways:
✦Instant transfer: Sending money this way means the money is immedi-
ately credited to the recipient’s account. That person can then transfer
the money to his or her personal bank account without delay. If you
want to send a transfer, you must have a credit or debit card registered
with PayPal as a backup for your funds — just in case your bank denies
the transfer. It’s just like writing a secure check — without exposing any
of your personal information (such as your checking account number)
to another party.
✦eCheck: Sending an eCheck isn’t as “instant” as an instant transfer. Just
like writing a check from your checking account, it can take up to four
days for the eCheck to clear. You do not need a backup source of funds
when you use eCheck.
✦PayPal balance: If someone sent you money through PayPal or you’ve
sold something on eBay (and your buyer has paid you through PayPal),
you have a balance in your PayPal account. This balance is first applied

Book II
Chapter 4
Simplifying
Payment with
PayPal
Understanding How PayPal Works
203
to any purchases you’ve made. Then when your account has no balance,
you can choose to pay by credit card. It’s simplest to keep your books
balanced if you withdraw any PayPal balance to your business checking
account before you make a purchase.
✦Credit card: Charge it! Putting your PayPal purchases on a credit card is
a good idea. Not only are you protected by PayPal, but your credit card
company also backs you up in case of fraud.
You can register multiple credit cards on your PayPal account and select a
different one for different types of purchases. That way, you can place per-
sonal purchases on one account and business purchases on another. It makes
end-of-year bookkeeping a lot easier!
Figuring out payment types
PayPal breaks types of payments into categories based on what you’re paying
for. You can pay for almost anything in the world on the PayPal system (as long
as the recipient has an e-mail address). A few things that you can’t pay for
with PayPal include anything related to gambling, adult content or services,
and buying or selling prescription drugs from noncertified sellers. If you’re
the seller of such items, you run the risk of being fined up to $500 by PayPal
if you use the service for payment collection in these arenas.
After you sign into your PayPal account, you can send money through
PayPal in the following ways:
✦Paying for eBay items: When you pay for an eBay item, you’re taken to 
a page where you can input the item number and your eBay user ID, so
that the payment will integrate directly with eBay’s user records.
✦Auction goods (off-eBay): You go to an area where you can pay for an
item purchased on sites other than eBay. You must input the URL for 
the item you purchased and the auction site. You can even compose a
message for the seller.
✦Goods (other): From this area, you can send money to anyone in the
world for goods purchased anywhere other than in an online auction.
✦Service: You can send payment for a service performed for you or 
your business, such as Web design, bookkeeping, psychic readings, 
or whatever.
✦Quasi cash: Use this when you need to send money to your kid in college
or pay back your roommate for saving you from great embarrassment
when you left your wallet at home on a double date.
When using the quasi-cash feature, consider using a payment method other
than credit card to avoid possible credit card fees for a cash advance.

PayPal’s Protection Plans
204
PayPal’s Protection Plans
Safety: Isn’t that what paying for things online is all about? Safety for the
buyer and safety for the seller are primary concerns in the minds of those
dealing on eBay. PayPal has created protection policies for both parties.
PayPal buyer protection
As a buyer who pays for his or her eBay items through PayPal, you can be
covered against fraud for up to $1000. You have to be sure that the seller’s
item has the PayPal protection shield (as shown in Figure 4-1) next to the
PayPal icon to get this buyer protection.
In this protection program, fraud is loosely defined as nondelivery of items
or when you receive an item that’s significantly different from the way it was
described. Sorry — this doesn’t cover you when you’re merely disappointed
with an item when you open the box.
When you’re browsing eBay, notice that some listings have the PayPal icon,
some have the PP icon and the shield, and some have no icon. Here’s what
these mean:
✦PayPal icon: The seller accepts PayPal as payment, and you’re cov-
ered under eBay’s standard purchase protection (up to $200, with a
$25 deductible).
✦PayPal icon and shield: The seller has qualified for his or her listings 
to be covered under the full buyer protection program (up to $1000).
✦No icon: The seller for the item accepts no PayPal payments, but you’re
still covered by eBay’s standard purchase protection.
Figure 4-2 shows a detail of eBay listings with these icons displayed.
Even if PayPal’s buyer protection doesn’t cover your item, PayPal still has basic
coverage for all transactions if you’ve been defrauded. The PayPal protection
shield in the Seller’s information box or in the listing merely tells you that the
seller maintains a level of professionalism and safety in his or her sales.
Figure 4-1:

Chapter 4

PayPal’s Protection Plans
205
Following are a few rules for using the buyer protection system and making
claims:
✦Number of claims: You may make only one claim per PayPal payment.
You may not file more than three claims per calendar year.
✦Timing: Your claim must be made within 30 days of your PayPal payment.
✦Participation: You must be ready and willing to provide information and
documentation to PayPal’s buyer protection team during the claims
process.
When you provide protection for your buyers, you show that you’re a pro-
fessional and make it more comfortable for them to purchase from you.
For sellers to qualify to offer buyer protection in their listings, they must
✦Have a minimum of 50 or more eBay feedback comments
✦Have at least 98% positive eBay feedback
✦Be a verified member of PayPal
✦Use a premier or business PayPal account to accept payments
✦Have a U.S. or Canadian PayPal account
✦Select PayPal as a payment option when listing an item on eBay
✦Have a PayPal account in good standing

PayPal’s Protection Plans
206
PayPal seller protection
Don’t think that sellers get left out of this protection thing. You do have
some protection against unwarranted claims made on your eBay sales;
it’s called seller protection.
To see whether your transaction is covered under seller protection, follow
these steps:
1. In your payment received e-mail from PayPal, click the View the
Details of the Transaction link.
2. Sign into your PayPal account.
3. Scroll down the Transaction Details page to the buyer’s shipping
address.
You’ll see whether the shipping address is confirmed. (PayPal con-
firms the address by making sure that the credit card billing address
matches the shipping address.) If it is, you must ship to that address to
be protected.
When your transaction is protected, should any fraud be involved (a stolen
credit card or identity hoax), you will not lose the money. PayPal guarantees
the transaction.
If you receive a PayPal payment that ships to an unconfirmed address, drop
the buyer a note and ask about the address. Usually you’ll get a reply that
makes you feel comfortable, and you’ll ship. Remember that you will not be
covered under seller protection if you ship to an unconfirmed address.
What’s this PayPal verified business all about?
Being PayPal verified is an important rating for
both seller and buyer. It means that someone
has checked and you really are who you say you
are. Becoming verified isn’t a big deal. All you
have to do is register your checking account
with PayPal. (Remember when you opened an
account at the bank? They got information about
you to be sure you were you, didn’t they?)
PayPal will make two teeny (less than $1)
deposits into your checking account. After they
have been transferred to your account, you can
log back into your PayPal account and confirm
the two amounts. That’s it — and you get free
pennies too!
If you live outside the United States, you
become verified by adding a credit card to your
account and enrolling in the Expanded Use pro-
gram, which is a similar confirmation scheme.

Book II
Chapter 4
Simplifying
Payment with
PayPal
Sorting Out PayPal’s Accounts
207
Surprise! There are a few other rules and restrictions. For sellers to be pro-
tected, they must
✦Have a verified business or premier account: You must have an upper-
level PayPal account to be covered.
✦Ship to a confirmed address: You must ship to the buyer’s address
exactly as displayed on the transaction details page.
✦Ship within seven days: The item must leave your place of business
within seven days of receiving payment.
✦Accept single payment from a single account: You must have accepted
one payment from one PayPal account to pay for the purchase. (No mul-
tiple account payments for an item.)
✦Ship tangible goods: Seller protection is not available for services, digi-
tal goods, and other electronically delivered items.
✦Provide proof of shipping: You need to provide reasonable proof-of-
shipment that can be tracked online. The transaction details page must
show that you shipped to the buyer’s address. A delivery confirmation
suffices for items valued up to $250.
If you use an automated shipping solution such as endicia.com, you also
just copy and paste the delivery confirmation numbers onto the PayPal
page. PayPal will send an e-mail to the buyer with the information for
their records.
For items worth $250.00 or more (£150.00 or more for the U.K.), you
must have a signature from the recipient as proof of receipt.
✦Not impose surcharges: Imposing a surcharge on the buyer is against
eBay policy anyway.
✦Cooperate with the complaint investigation: If a complaint is filed, you
must provide complete information about the transaction within seven
days of a request from PayPal.
If PayPal is required by the buyer’s issuing credit card company to
respond immediately to resolve a chargeback situation, you must pro-
vide all information within three days.
At this writing, seller protection is available only for U.S. and Canadian sell-
ers transacting with U.S. buyers and for U.K. sellers transacting with U.K. or
U.S. buyers. Check back with the PayPal site for any changes in this policy.
Sorting Out PayPal’s Accounts
PayPal has three types of accounts to accommodate everyone from the casual
seller to the professional business: personal, business, and premier accounts.

Sorting Out PayPal’s Accounts
208
PayPal personal account
When you begin your career with PayPal, you may want to sign up for a per-
sonal account. With this basic account from PayPal, you can send and receive
money (non-credit-card payments) for free. PayPal personal accounts are
for only one person and not for a business. You can’t have a joint personal
account, either.
Business and premier accounts
The PayPal professional seller (business and premier) accounts allow you to
accept credit card payments, get a debit card, and participate in PayPal’s
high-yield money market fund. A premier account is held in an individual’s
name (although it may still be for a business); a business account can be
held in a business name and allows multiple login names. At these account
levels, you have access to a customer service phone number.
A fee is levied on all money you receive through PayPal at this level, but the
costs are reasonable. (Just ask anyone with a brick-and-mortar business 
that accepts credit cards.) PayPal has a standard rate and a merchant rate,
as shown in Table 4-1. The merchant rate has three tiers, based on your
monthly sales volume. When you open your account, you’re charged the
standard rate. After your sales grow and you’ve been receiving more than
$3000 per month through PayPal for three consecutive months, you can
apply for a merchant account.

Downloading Your Payment History from PayPal
I’ve been running a home-based business since the mid-1980s. Because I
came from a corporate background working in the newspaper business, I’ve
always known that record-keeping is important. But record-keeping has
always been the bane of my existence. When I began my home-based busi-
ness, the first thing I did was to hire a lawyer and a CPA to teach me what I
had to do.
Record-keeping means keeping track of everything: Every penny, sou, far-
thing, or ruble that you spend or take in. In the United States (and in most
other countries), we have a little thing called taxes. We all have to turn in tax
returns of several sorts when we run a business — and they’d better be cor-
rect. There may come a day when you receive a letter from a State or Federal
tax agency asking to take a look at your books. This is simply a nice way of
saying the dreaded word, audit.
The best defense against an audit is to have backup records. The more
records you have proving your business income and expenses, the less
painful your audit will be. One excellent piece of information to have at 
your fingertips is your PayPal history.
Besides meeting tax-reporting requirements, keeping good records keeps
you on top of your business dealings. (See Book IX for more about how good
record-keeping helps your business succeed.) PayPal helps you with this all-
important record-keeping by providing customizable, downloadable reports
on your buying and selling activity.
PayPal allows you to customize and download your transaction reports at
any time. You might want to consider downloading your reports on a monthly
or quarterly basis — as well as generating one big report at the end of the
year. Or you may want to download the reports to coincide with your state
sales tax payments (for backup documentation) or to keep a record of your
monthly totals.
You can download reports in several formats. The most flexible is a comma-
delimited file that can be opened and edited in a spreadsheet program, such
as Excel or Microsoft Works.
By using a spreadsheet file as your record of customers, you’re not bogging
down a bookkeeping program with hundreds and eventually thousands of
records of one-time buyers. Even a robust program like QuickBooks will max
out at around 14,000 customers!

Customizing and downloading your reports
PayPal is great when it comes to downloading your reports. You can narrow
your downloads to incoming transactions for a one-day period or see all
transactions for the year or more!
You may need all the information that PayPal gives you. If that’s what you
want, great. But PayPal can give you information overkill. I go over some of
the options here, so you can decide which ones are important to keep in
your permanent record.
All your downloadable PayPal reports can contain the following information
by default:
✦Date: The date each PayPal transaction occurred.
✦Time: The time the payment was made.
✦Time zone: The time zone used for recording transactions in your
PayPal account.
✦Name: The name of the person to whom you sent money or from whom
you received money.
✦Type: The type of transaction that occurred: deposit, withdrawal, ATM
withdrawal, payment sent, payment received, and so on.
✦Status: The status of the transaction at the time you download the file
(cleared, completed, denied, and so on).
✦Gross: The gross amount involved in the transaction (before any fees
are deducted).
✦Fee: Any PayPal fees charged to the transaction.
✦Net: The net dollar amount of the transaction. This is the total received,
less any PayPal fees.
✦From e-mail: The e-mail address of the sender.
✦To e-mail: The e-mail address of the recipient.
If you use different e-mail addresses to classify different types of sales,
this can be a good sorting point for your reports. For example, I receive
payments for my personal auctions to one e-mail and payments for my
business to another.
✦Item ID: That strange combination of letters and numbers that PayPal
assigns to each transaction. Decide whether this is important for your
records. (I don’t use it.)
✦Item title: The title of the auction related to the transaction.
✦Shipping amount: The amount the buyer paid for shipping. It’s a good
idea to use this field because it helps you separate merchandise revenue
from shipping revenue.

211
✦Auction site: If you’re collecting money from other auction sites through
PayPal, you might want to include this link so that you can sort your
sales by auction site.
✦Item URL: The Internet address of the auction or transaction. (For eBay,
the URLs are on the site for up to 90 days — here you can go back a year.)
✦Closing date: The date the transaction closed. The record will always
contain the date the payment posted to your PayPal account, whether
you indicate a closing date here or not.
✦Shipping address: The address to which the item was shipped.
✦Counter party status (verified versus unverified): A record of whether
your buyer was PayPal verified.
✦Address status (confirmed versus unconfirmed): Shows whether the
address you shipped to was confirmed.
✦Sales tax: Information about sales tax you collected.
To get your reports from PayPal, follow these steps:
1. Go to www.PayPal.com and log onto your account with your e-mail
address and password.
After you’re logged on, the top of your page displays various tabs, as
shown in Figure 4-3.
2. Click the My Account tab.
3. Click the History item on the navigation bar.
You are now in your account history area; on the right you’ll see a 
box titled Reporting Tools. In that area are a few options, including
Download My History and Merchant Sales Report. The Merchant Sales
Report is a nice tool, but if you’re posting your sales regularly to a pro-
gram such as QuickBooks, you’ll have reports out the wazoo that’ll give
you tons of higher-quality information.

4. Click the Download My History link.
You land on the Download History page. Before you start clicking any-
thing, consider customizing your reports.
5. Click the Customize My History’s Download link.
6. Select the fields you want to include by putting a check mark in the
box next to the desired data.
For details on the different options, see the list before this set of steps.
7. Click Save.
You’re returned to the Download History page, as shown in Figure 4-4.
Your customization is saved for future report downloads.
If you’re a seller in the U.K., your page will look slightly different than the
one pictured. Your dates will be in the format of DD/MM/YY.
8. Type the dates that you want to span in the downloaded report.
9. Select a format for your download from the following:
• Comma-delimited file: This type of file downloads with the .csv
extension. You can open a comma-delimited file easily in Microsoft
Excel or Microsoft Works using the All Files option, as shown in
Figure 4-5. (Microsoft Works doesn’t have a direct .csv importer,
but the file will open with the All Files *.* command.)

• Tab-delimited file: This file downloads with the .txt extension. It
can be opened not only in a spreadsheet program but also as a text
file in Windows Notepad or a word processing program such as
Microsoft Word for Windows.
• Quicken or QuickBooks file: These files download in the native
format ready to import into these Intuit bookkeeping programs. Just
remember, after these files are imported, they’re in there for good.
Saving these files for spreadsheet use does not limit you in the future
as to what version of which program will open what. The .txt and
.csv files are universal files that can be opened on any PC with basic
spreadsheet capabilities.
10. Click the Download History button.
If you’ve asked for a long time frame (such as a year), go make yourself a
cup of joe. When you come back, your file will be ready to download.
Saving and editing your reports
When your computer is ready to receive the downloaded file (which may
take a while — especially if you have a dial-up connection), a window like
the one shown in Figure 4-6 pops up.
Click the Save button to save the file to a directory on your computer. In the
next screen, select the directory where you want to save the file. I recommend
setting up a directory that contains only Internet and eBay sales files.
After the file is saved, you can open it. Figure 4-7 shows a downloaded history
file opened in Microsoft Works. You can re-sort the columns, total the sales,
and delete unnecessary columns.

This file is now part of your eBay business archive, should the day come that
you need to produce it. Be sure to back it up, just in case.
Some CPAs recommend that you keep these files for up to seven years. To be
safe, check with your own tax professional, who understands the needs for
your particular tax situation.

eBay offers you an amazing variety of tools. Because the site is constantly
changing, few of us know where all these tools are and how to use them.
It’s always an eye-opener when I poke around the site and find a new cool
tool or neat shortcut.
Aside from the tools I tell you about in this chapter, the most important
shortcut I can give you is to remind you to sign in and select the box that
says “Keep me signed in on this computer unless I sign out” before you
attempt to do anything on eBay. This will permit you to do all your busi-
ness on eBay without being bugged for your password at every turn.
Your computer holds your sign-in information until you sign out. If you have
more than one user ID or share a computer with other people, be sure to
sign out when you’re finished. For your protection, you still have to type
your password for actions involving financial or personal information. To
specify the tasks for which you want eBay to remember your sign-in infor-
mation, go to the eBay Preferences area of the My eBay page.
Many solid third-party services and tools are available. Book VIII lets you in
on some of my favorites.

signed in to bid, sell, or buy, so do it!
1. Click the Sign In link at the top of the navigation bar.
(If you’re already signed in, the link will read Sign Out.)You’re sent to the
Sign In page.
2. Type your user ID and password, as shown in Figure 5-1.
Type your registered eBay user ID, not your e-mail address. Your user ID
and e-mail address are no longer interchangeable on the site.
If you ever forget your eBay password, you can click the Forgot your
password? link or go to the following:
http://cgi4.ebay.com/ws1/eBayISAPI.dll?ForgotYour

If you remember the answer to the question you were asked during the
eBay registration process, you can create a new password immediately.
3. Click the Sign In button.
You’re now signed in and ready to do almost anything on eBay! You are
brought to your My eBay Summary page.

site, you automatically have a My eBay page, so let’s delve into exactly what
it can do for you.
I call My eBay a page, but it’s really an area — a group of several pages held
together with links. The My eBay area gives you complete control of every-
thing you are doing (or would like to do) on eBay.
You have to sign in to the site before you can use the My eBay area.
To get to your My eBay page, click the My eBay link on the eBay navigation
bar, which is at the top of every eBay page.
My eBay is divided into six areas: My Summary, All Buying, All Selling, My
Messages, All Favorites, and My Account, as described in Table 5-1. You can
visit each area by clicking links in the My eBay Views box, on the left side of
the page. The top link of each My eBay area presents you with a summary
of the activity in that area. The links below the top link take you to specific
data, without having to scroll through a long page.
Table 5-1
In a Snapshot: Views of the My eBay Area
Click Here
To See This on Your My eBay Page
My Summary
A page summarizing your My eBay area, with notifications of actions
that need follow-up on the balance of the My eBay pages.
All Buying
Every item for sale that you’re watching or bidding on, and all items
you’ve won and lost.
All Selling
All the information about any items you’re selling on eBay.
My Messages
A direct and secure place to view the latest information about eBay.
No more worry about phishing spam. When eBay has something to tell
you, it appears here.
All Favorites
A collection of links to your favorite categories, searches, sellers, and
stores.
My Account
An area that contains links to several important areas: your eBay
account information, such as seller’s fees and invoices; the most
recent feedback comments about you, links that send you to all the
feedback you’ve left and received, and an area where you can
respond to feedback; and finally, preferences you can specify so that
eBay performs just as you want it to.
At the bottom of the My eBay Views box on the left side of the page is another
box with convenient links to services and to answers you may need while
doing business on eBay (see Figure 5-2). The task-specific pages of My eBay
may show a More link in this additional links box. Click the More link and
you’ll be presented with a page of links related to the page you’re on.

Taking Advantage of My eBay
218
The links you see depend on the page you were on when you clicked the
More link. Buying-related links are linked from the All Buying page, selling
links from the All Selling page, account links from the My Account page, 
and Favorites links from the All Favorites page. When you have a question
regarding an eBay procedure, you’ll find these links handy. Figure 5-3 shows
some related links from the All Selling page.
Before you freak out because you have a question about something on eBay
that you can’t remember the answer to, double-check the Related Links box.
These links link to related help information. If you need more info, you can
always click the Help link on the navigation bar.

My eBay: Summary Page
Until you set your preferences (as to which page you want to automatically
open your My eBay area to — see further on), you land on the My Summary
page. Mine is shown in Figure 5-4.
The My Summary page gives you a snapshot of your current eBay business.
It provides data about your buying and selling business and supplies links to
the items.
The Buying Reminders area tells you about
✦Items you’re watching that close today
✦Items you’re bidding on that close today
✦Items you’ve been outbid on (and may need to up your bid)
✦Feedback that you need to leave for items you’ve won
Figure 5-4:

In the Selling Reminders area, you find info on
✦Questions pending on items from prospective customers
✦Buyers who have requested totals for their purchases
✦How many items you are awaiting payment on
✦How many items you need to ship
✦Cross-promotions that need to be revised due to items ending 
(if you have an eBay store)
✦The number of items you’re selling that are closing today
✦How many items you’ve sold that need feedback
You can customize what you’d like to appear on most of the My eBay pages
by clicking the Customize Summary link in the right corner. Figure 5-5 shows
you the customization options for the My Summary page.
Should you subscribe to any of eBay’s paid services such as Picture Manager
or eBay Stores, there will also be a link to your subscription area. In addition,
a link is provided to any important notices from eBay regarding changes in its
policies or services.
My eBay: All Buying Page
The All Buying page is the hub for keeping track of your bids, your wins,
items you’re watching, and any items you didn’t win. This area of My eBay
helps you control everything you’re currently shopping for on the site. I
check this page several times a day to see the progress of items I’m inter-
ested in.

Watching link
Have you ever seen an auction that made you think, “I don’t want to bid on
this just now, but I’d like to buy it if it’s a bargain”? Clicking the Watching
link from the My eBay Views box will bring you to the Items I’m Watching
page (see Figure 5-6), one of the most powerful features of the My eBay area.
This page lists each auction with a countdown (time left) timer, so you know
exactly when the auction will close. When an auction on your watch list
gets close to ending, you can swoop down and make the kill — if the price
is right.
Are you interested in an item? You can observe the bidding action — the
number of bids and how fast the price is rising (or not) — without showing
your hand to the competition.
Also a handy marketing tool, the Items I’m Watching page allows you to store
auctions from competitive sellers. That way, you can monitor the status of
items similar to ones you plan to sell later and see whether the items are
selling high or low, helping you to decide whether it’s a good time to sell.
You’ve probably seen the Watch this item link at the top of each listing page.
If you’re watching items (eBay allows you to monitor 100 auctions at a time),
you’ll see a notation on the page, indicating how many auctions you’re cur-
rently watching.
Figure 5-6:
Sit back and
observe at
My eBay.

My eBay: All Buying Page
222
The watch list function is that it allows me to keep my bargain hunting quiet.
Everybody knows when you’re bidding on an item; nobody knows when
you’re watching the deals like a hawk. When you’re looking for bargains to
buy and resell, you may not want to tip off the competition by letting them
know you’re bidding.
Bidding link
When you place a bid, eBay registers it in the Items I’m Bidding On area, as
shown in Figure 5-7, and displays a clickable link to the item.
Make the bidding page a daily stop on eBay, so you can see the status of
your bids:
✦Bid amounts in green indicate that you’re the high bidder in the auction.
✦Bid amounts in red indicate that your bid is losing. If you want to
increase your bid, simply click the auction title to go to the auction.
✦Dutch auctions appear in black. To determine whether you retain high
bidder status in a Dutch auction, you have to go to the actual auction.
✦The My Max Bid column reminds you of the amount of your highest bid;
if you see a bid that surpasses your own, you’ll know it’s time to throw
in another bid to stay in the game.

Keeping
track of your
bidding.

Book II
Chapter 5
Using eBay’s
Management Tools
My eBay: All Buying Page
223
✦The Bidding Totals box, at the top of the Bidding page, lists the current
dollar amount you’re spending versus the number of items you’re cur-
rently winning in pending auctions. You’ll see the total amount you’ve
bid and a separate total representing auctions you’re winning.
✦As auctions on which you’ve bid end, they are transferred to the Won or
Didn’t Win page, based on your success or failure in the bidding process.
You can make notations on your bidding or item watching. Just click to place a
check mark next to the item you want to annotate, click the Add Note button,
and then add the information.
Won link
Clicking the Won link in the All Buying area in the My eBay Views box dis-
plays all the items you’ve won as far back as the last 60 days, as shown in
Figure 5-8. The default is 31 days, which should suffice for most transactions.
The Items I’ve Won page is a great place to keep track of items that you’re
waiting to receive from the seller. It’s also a convenient way to keep track of
your expenditures, should you be buying for resale.
Helpful features on the Items I’ve Won page include the following:
✦Check box: Click the check box and then click the Add Note button
to add information about the particular auction or perform a selected
action such as deleting it from the list.
✦Seller’s user ID: This link sends you to the seller’s Member Profile 
(feedback) page, where you can send an e-mail to the seller.
Figure 5-8:
What I won
on eBay.

My eBay: All Buying Page
224
✦Auction title: A link to the auction. I always use this when an item arrives
so that I can be sure that the item I received is exactly as advertised.
✦Item number: The auction number for your records.
✦Auction sale date: A convenient way to see whether your item is slow
in shipping. After a week, it doesn’t hurt to drop the seller an e-mail to
check on the shipping status.
✦Sale price and quantity: Helps you keep track of the money you’ve spent.
Works with the totals in the Won Totals area at the top of the screen.
Using My eBay to manage your sales
For the newbie seller, the tools on the All Selling
pages are great. They’re simple and get right to
the point. To run their auction business, small
sellers can use the All Selling page with the Sell
Your Item form for individual listings and every-
thing should be sufficient.
On the All Selling page, you can view details for
your active listings, including:
 Links for listings: Each listing has clickable
links you can use to go instantly to an item
page.
 Item number: In case you need an item
number to contact a bidder or send auction
information to a friend, you’ll find the item
number here.
 Current price: This is the starting price of
your item (if you have no bids) or the cur-
rent price based on bids received.
 Reserve price: This handy feature reminds
you of the reserve price that you’ve set on
an item. There’s nowhere else to check this.
 Quantity available: Here’s where you can
see how many of the item are still available
for purchase on the site. When a eBay store
item is listed, this feature shows you how
many are left and the original quantity you
listed.
 # of bids: When you see that the price is
rising on an item, check out this column to
see how many bids have been placed to
date.
 Start date: This is the date the listing was
posted on eBay.
 End date: This is the date the listing will end.
 Time left: In this column, you can check
how much time is left (to the minute) in your
listing.
 Action: This is the handiest column of all.
Here, you have a link that lets you list a sim-
ilar item. This is particularly handy if you
want to use a template again for another
item. It also allows you to revise a listing,
add to the description, end a listing, or edit
promotions if you have a store.

how the My eBay: All Selling area can help you

✦Action: This column displays different commands based on the status of
your transaction. You can click a link to pay for the item through PayPal,
view the payment status on paid items, mark the item paid if you paid
through other payment methods, or leave feedback after you’ve received
the item and are satisfied that it’s what you ordered.
✦Icons: At the end of each item’s listing are three icons that appear dimmed
until the selected action is taken. A dollar sign indicates whether you’ve
paid for the item, a star indicates that you’ve left feedback, and a quote
bubble indicates whether feedback has been left for you.
After you receive an item and leave feedback, click the box to the left of the
item listing, and then click the button to remove the selected completed
transactions from view.
Didn’t win link
Sniff, the Didn’t Win area is a very sad place. This My eBay section lets you
know when you’ve been outbid and lost an item. This option isn’t there to
rub your nose in all the auctions you’ve lost — it’s a handy tool that lets you
search the seller’s other items for something similar or search the category
for a similar item.
My eBay: All Favorites Page
If you sell and have an interest in a few categories, look no further than the
My eBay All Favorites zone, which gives you some links for checking out
what’s hot and what’s not. All Favorites helps you track trends and find
some bargains to resell on eBay.
Searches link
A tool that comes in handy for sellers as well as buyers is the Searches link
(in the All Favorites area of the My eBay Views box). You can list as many as
100 favorite searches. When you want to check one out, simply click the item
in the Name of Search column (see Figure 5-9).
Are you always looking for certain things on eBay? For example, maybe you
plan to search frequently for a Callaway Seven Heaven Wood — whatever.
Add it to your list of favorite searches and you won’t have to retype Callaway
Seven Heaven Wood more than once. (Now there’s a blessing!) By organizing
your favorite searches, you can search for your favorite items with a click
of your mouse on the title links.

My eBay: All Favorites Page
226
You can view saved searches, change them, delete them, or indicate that
you’d like to receive e-mail notification when a new item is listed. To add an
item to the list, run a search from the search box on any eBay page and click
the Add to Favorites link that appears at the top of the search results. The
next time you reload your My eBay All Favorites page, your new favorite will
be listed.
Be sure to use all the search trick shortcuts I showed you in the table in
Chapter 1, because these searches are not performed in the search box.
These are single line searches that you normally would perform from the
small search boxes on the eBay pages.
To set up a favorite search, click the Add new Search link on the All Favorites
page. You’re forwarded to eBay’s Search page. Type your keywords and per-
form your search. When the results appear, click the Add to Favorites link
at the top of the page, and your search will be saved to your My eBay All
Favorites page.
If you choose to receive e-mail when your search locates a new listing, you
can request that you receive notification from seven days to a year. You’re
allowed to receive new listing e-mails on 30 of your 100 searches. Just click
the Edit Preferences link in the far-right column (refer to Figure 5-9). eBay
sends its robot to check listings each night, so you’ll get a notification of new
listings the next morning.

Keeping track of favorite searches is a valuable tool when you’re looking for
particular items to resell and want to find them at bargain-basement prices.
Be sure to take advantage of asterisks (wildcard characters) and alternate
spellings so you can catch items with misspellings in the title. These are
your best bets for low prices.
Sellers link
When you’ve been on eBay for awhile, you will find that certain sellers carry
a type of merchandise that interests you. By saving their user IDs in the My
Favorite Sellers area, you’ll be able to revisit their current auctions without
having to run a seller search from the search area. Remember that the pur-
pose of the My eBay page is to have all your controls in one area.
From a seller’s point of view, My Favorite Sellers is where you can keep a list
of people who sell items similar to what you sell. You can check up on them
and see what they’re selling, when they’re selling it, and for how much. It’s a
helpful tool that can prevent you from listing an item right next to one of
their auctions.
My Favorite Sellers is handy also when your competition is selling an item
that you plan to sell, but at a deeply discounted price. When that happens,
don’t offer yours until they sell out of the item, at which time the price will
most likely go back up — supply and demand, remember? I have a few qual-
ity wholesalers and liquidators under My Favorite Sellers, too, and search
for lots that I can resell at a profit.
To add a seller to your My Favorite Sellers list, click the Add new Seller or
Store link in the upper-right corner of the page. On the page that appears,
type the seller’s user ID or store name. You may add a maximum of 30 sellers
to your list.
Categories link
The My Favorite Categories area has got to be eBay’s cruel joke. For some
reason, you’re allowed to select only four categories! Certainly that’s not
enough for an inveterate shopper (or active seller). But four it is. Click the
Add new Category link at the top-right of this area to change or set your cat-
egories through eBay’s drop-down lists. These quick category links give you
the chance to quickly check out the competition.
You select the main category, and if there’s a subcategory below it, an arrow
will appear at the end of the category name. And if there is an arrow after the
subcategory, another subcategory box will open up, until you reach a cate-
gory that doesn’t end in an arrow, as shown in Figure 5-10. Select up to four
categories to monitor, and then click Submit.

My eBay: All Favorites Page
228
Each category is assigned a number, as you can see at the top of Figure 5-10.
If you know the number of your favorite category, you can just type it into
the category number box and not go through the drop-down list selection
process.
Figure 5-11 shows the My Favorite Categories area after I selected my four
categories.
To browse your favorite categories, you have to select one of the four links
offered:
✦Current: This link displays every item currently being auctioned in the
category, with the most recent listings shown first.

229
With this search, you may end up with thousands of items to wade
through.
✦Starting Today: Displays all items put up for sale within the past 24 hours,
with the newest listings shown first.
✦Ending Today: Shows you every auction closing within the next 24 hours,
starting with those ending first. The ending time is printed in red if the
auction closes within five hours.
A more efficient search, especially in a category with tens of thousands
of items, is the Starting Today or Ending Today link. These links trim the
number of listed items to a controllable number.
✦Ending Within 5 Hours: Lists auctions in the category that are ending in
the next five hours. This link offers a fun way to find items you can snipe.
Before you list a popular item, estimate the date and hour that other auc-
tions selling the same item will close. Then go into the category and check to
be sure that your auction won’t be closing during a flood of auctions for the
same item. Nothing kills profits more than closing an auction in the middle 
of a series of auctions selling the same thing. You can watch the final values
drop one at a time.
My eBay: My Account Page
The My Account page (see mine in Figure 5-12) lets you know how much you
owe eBay and how much they will charge your credit card that month. This
is a quick and easy way to check your last invoice, payments and credits,
and your account; all the links are located in one area. You can also access
your PayPal account to see, for example, when deposits were sent to your
checking account.
Personal information link
Click the Personal Information link (below My Account in the My eBay Views
box) to get to the Personal Information page. This page holds all the links to
your personal information on eBay. This is where you can change your e-mail
address, user ID (without losing your feedback), password, and credit card
information, and edit or create your About Me page. You can also change or
access any registration or credit card information that you have on file at eBay.
There’s even a link to change your home address on record.
Keeping all your contact information up-to-date on eBay is important. If they
should ever find that any of the contact information is wrong, they may sus-
pend your membership.

My eBay: My Account Page
230
Another link, Change my notification preferences, allows you to input your
text messaging number for your cellular phone, for example:
areacodeandnumber@messaging.nextel.com
That way, eBay can notify you on your cell phone when you get outbid or
when you win an item.
Adding a wireless e-mail address for your cell phone may seem like a great
idea: eBay can send end-of-auction notices right to your WAP-enabled cell
phone. The trouble is, sometimes these messages are sent hours after the
listing ends. So don’t count on receiving timely updates.
Manage subscriptions link
Click the Manage subscriptions link (below My Account in the My eBay
Views box), and you’ll be able to see just which additional selling tools
you’re paying for. From here, you can upgrade, downgrade, or unsubscribe.
eBay preferences link
Another link below My Account is eBay preferences. A nifty feature of the
eBay Preferences area (see Figure 5-13) is the opportunity to customize
(by clicking the Change link) how you see your My eBay pages. If you run
many auctions, you can show as many as 200 items on these pages.
You can also customize your eBay Sign In activities by clicking the Change
link in the eBay Sign In Preferences area of the screen. You may as well select
everything, so that you won’t be constantly hammered for your password

while conducting business at eBay. Visit the eBay Preferences area to change
the way eBay reacts to your sign-in information. You can set eBay to require
your password every time you bid or perform eBay tasks. Or not. It’s up 
to you.
Feedback link
In Book I, I talk all about the importance of feedback to the eBay community.
In the Feedback area of the My eBay; My Account page, you can keep track
of all your feedback duties.
When you click the Feedback link, you can see your items awaiting Feedback,
and a link on the right will take you to the Feedback Forum, where you can
perform many feedback-related functions:
✦Find all item listings from the last 90 days that you haven’t left feedback
for. (For shame!)
✦Review and respond to feedback left for you. Responding to feedback is
especially important, especially if the feedback is less than stellar. Every
story has two sides.
✦See all feedback you have left for others. If you want to re-examine feed-
back that you’ve left, this is the place.
Below these boxes is a listing of all your feedback dating back to your first
transaction on eBay.

Ramping Up with Selling Manager
When you’ve been bitten by the selling bug, it’s a natural transition to go
from a monthly listing of a few items to 50 or more. That means, dear reader,
that you are officially running an eBay business. Congratulations!
This has a good and a bad side. The good is that you’re making considerably
more cash than you did before hooking up with eBay. The bad? It’s time to
start investing in tools to keep your business professional.
The first tool that can help smooth your transition makes the process of run-
ning eBay auctions and sales consistent — Selling Manager. This section tells
you what Selling Manager does, but Book VIII goes into more of the program’s
intricacies.
Book III, Chapter 4 gets into eBay’s free Turbo Lister program (it gets your
items on the site without having to go through the slow, sometimes tortur-
ous Sell Your Item form). As with Turbo Lister, Selling Manager is a suite of
tools for managing your selling business from any computer (as long as it
has an Internet connection). eBay gives you 30 days to try out the service
for free, and thereafter charges $4.99 per month. (Believe me, the time that
Selling Manager saves you is well worth the fee.)
I’ve run well over 100 auctions in a single month, successfully managing
them with Selling Manager. I use it along with PayPal’s tools and QuickBooks.
This approach provides a professional solution for my medium-sized eBay
business.
First glimpse of Selling Manager
To subscribe to your free Selling Manager trial program, follow these steps:
1. On the eBay navigation bar, which is at the top of every eBay page,
click the Site Map link.
2. In the first column of the Site Map, under the Sell heading, click the
eBay Selling Manager link.
3. Read the information on the Selling Manager hub page, and then click
the Subscribe Now link.
You’re now subscribed to your 30-day free trial. If you continue using Selling
Manager, eBay adds a $4.99 fee to your monthly bill. eBay automatically pop-
ulates Selling Manager with your information from the My eBay: All Selling
page. The All Selling link will change to Selling Manager when it’s all set up.
With Selling Manager, you can click the link to view a summary of all your
auction activities.

The Summary page lists at-a-glance statistics so you can quickly see what’s
going on with your sales, at any time — from any computer. Links to other
pages in the Selling Manager tool also appear on the Summary page.
eBay’s Selling Manager
Selling Manager replaces the All Selling area
of your My eBay page with its own summary 
of your current transactions (see the figure).
Many sellers (even PowerSellers) rely on
Selling Manager to handle their eBay manage-
ment chores.
From Selling Manager, you can
 View listing status: You can see which
sales activities you’ve completed and what
you still have to do.
 Send custom e-mail and post feedback:
Customize your e-mail templates and set up
stored feedback comments to help you run
through the post-sales process quickly.
 Relist in bulk: Relist multiple sold and
unsold listings at once.
 Maintain sales records: See individual
sales records for every transaction, includ-
ing a history of the transaction status.
 Print invoices and shipping labels: Print
labels and invoices directly from sales
records.
 Download sales history: Export your sales
records to keep files on your computer.
 Keep track of UPI (unpaid items) and FVF:
File nonpaying bidder alerts and final value
fee requests.

If you plan to exceed 100 transactions a month, consider using Selling Manager
Pro, which costs $15.99 per month. The Pro version has bulk feedback and
bulk invoice-printing features and incorporates inventory management.
Scheduled listings link
The Scheduled Listings link on the Summary page takes you to any auction,
fixed-price listing, or store listing you’ve sent to eBay through Turbo Lister
(or listed on the Sell Your Item page) and scheduled as pending for a later
starting date or time. You can view these pending listings also through links
on the Summary page that narrow the listings down to Starting Within the
Next Hour and Starting Today.
When you enter the Scheduled Listings area by clicking the Scheduled Listings
link on the Summary page, you can go directly to the listing. If you want to pro-
mote your listing-to-be in a banner ad (or create a link to it from elsewhere on
the Internet), you can do so using the URL of the pending listing.
From the Pending Listing page, you can confirm all information about the
sale, as well as make any changes to the listing or to the scheduling time.
Active listings link
Click the Active Listings link on the Summary page, and you can observe the
bidding action just as you can from the My eBay All Selling page. The color-
coding that indicates bidding activity is the same as that on the My eBay All
Selling page, and your listings are accessible with a click of your mouse.
You have the option to show only auctions, only store listings, or only fixed-
price items on the Active Listings page. You can also search your own listings
by keyword or item number.
For more about active listings, visit the Summary page, which includes links
to items ending within the hour and those ending within the next 24 hours.
Sold listings link
The Sold Listings feature (which you get to by clicking the link on the
Summary page), is where Selling Manager really shines. You’ll find quite
a few links here, including these:
✦Awaiting payment: This is where items that have been won or bought
are listed before a payment is made.
✦Awaiting payment, items that are eligible for nonpaying bidder alerts:
Items that are awaiting payment fall to this area when they become 

Book II
Chapter 5
Using eBay’s
Management Tools
Ramping Up with Selling Manager
235
eligible for you to file a nonpaying bidder alert. This happens when 
seven days have passed without a payment being received.
✦Paid and ready to ship: If you input the fact that a buyer has sent pay-
ment, or if the buyer pays using PayPal, the transaction automatically
moves to this category.
✦Paid and ready for feedback: Once an item is paid for, a reference to it
appears here so you can keep track of the feedback you need to leave.
✦Paid and shipped: These are (you guessed it) items that the buyer has
paid for and that you’ve indicated as shipped on the transaction record.
✦Unpaid and eligible for final value fee credit: This is the sad category
where buyers from the nonpaying bidder column go if, after all your
attempts to get action, they have not responded and sent payment.
(If they don’t cough up within ten days after you file a nonpaying bidder
alert, the listing moves to this category automatically.)
Sold listings past due link
Finally, eBay has made it easy for the seller to deal with unpaid items (previ-
ously referred to as nonpaying bidders). The Sold Listings Past Due link on
the Summary page walks you through every step of the process, letting you
know when an item is qualified for unpaid item notice, all the way through
getting your final value refund.
Archived listings link
From the Archived Listings link, you can access completed items that closed
within the last four months. You can also download this information to your
computer. These are good records, so download them and keep them.
Tracking payments from eBay’s Selling Manager
Selling Manager makes many selling processes
considerably easier. The number to the right of
the Paid and ready to ship link on the Summary
page indicates that you have items ready to
ship. To see the details on these items, just click
this link. You see each transaction; a bold dollar-
sign icon to the right of a listing confirms that a
payment has been made.
To indicate that you’ve shipped an item, click
the record number next to the item and scroll
down to the Sales Status & Memo area. Click
Save, and the record moves from the Paid and
Ready to Ship page (under Sold Listings) to the
Paid and Shipped page.

Ramping Up with Selling Manager
236
Seller tools
The Seller Tools box on the left side of the Summary page contains a powerful
group of links that allow you to download and export your sales history to
your computer. You also have links to PayPal, the Selling Manager Discussion
Board, My eBay Store, and the good old My eBay All Selling page — in case
you get nostalgic for the old, pre–Selling Manager days.
Cross-promotions
If you have an eBay store, you may notice that the Cross Promotions area, on
the right side of the Summary page, has a great many links. This is where you
can set up a merchandising bar showing the selected items you have for sale.
This bar appears on the listing page of the items you’re selling.
If you have an eBay store, additional links appear in this area for controlling
which of your items go into the merchandising bar.

S
elling on eBay is a grand idea. You clean out your garage, sell things you
would have thrown away anyway, and make a profit. What a wonderful
marketplace! You can make money in your spare time and enhance your
lifestyle with just a few clicks on your keyboard and mouse.
When you decide to sell on eBay in earnest, however, you can run into prob-
lems. Few eBay sellers have a background in retailing or marketing, and
eBay is all about retailing and marketing. In this chapter, I give you tips on
pricing strategies. The first item on the agenda is to understand all the fees
involved with running an e-business on eBay.
Keeping an Eye on Where the Pennies Go
It doesn’t seem so much: $.30 to list an item plus a small final value fee. Of
course, a few cents go to PayPal. One by one, these minute amounts tend to
breeze by even the most experienced seller. You don’t really see your eBay
fees, because they’re not directly deducted from your sales. eBay bills you
at the end of the month. It’s easy to lose track of your costs unless you are
keeping very good books (more on that in Book IX).
All those nickels, dimes, and quarters add up. The hundreds (thousands?)
of people who are selling items on the site for $1 can’t be making much of a
profit — not even enough for a pack of gum! To avoid this low-profit trap,
you must be keenly aware of every penny you spend of eBay listing fees,
eBay final value fees, listing options, and PayPal fees.

Keeping an Eye on Where the Pennies Go
240
Becoming complacent and blithely ignoring your eBay costs as you list items
for sale is easy to do. As a person in business for yourself, you must always
take into account outgoing costs as well as incoming profits. The cost of
your initial listing is just the beginning of your advertising budget for that
item. You have to factor in the cost of all the options and features you use
as well. After all that, a final value fee is paid to eBay after the item sells.
(For fees regarding your eBay store, check out Book VIII, Chapter 6.)
In this section, I review the costs for listing an auction on eBay. But if you
use a credit card payment service, they also charge a fee. Later in this 
chapter, I examine the costs of the most popular credit card payment 
services.
Insertion (listing) fees
Your insertion fee is based on the highest dollar amount of two things: your
minimum opening bid or the dollar amount of your reserve price. If you start
your auction at $.99 and have no reserve, the listing fee is $.30. But if you
start your auction at $.99 and set an undisclosed reserve price of $50.00,
your auction costs $4.40 to post. When you place a reserve on your item,
you’re charged an insertion fee based on the amount of the reserve — plus
the reserve auction charge.
The reserve auction charge is automatically refunded if the reserve price
is met.
For a summary of eBay insertion fees, see Table 1-1. (The fees for eBay
Motors are shown later in this chapter.)
Table 1-1
eBay Listing Fees (Fixed-Price Single Item or Auction)
Opening Bid or Reserve Price ($)
Insertion Fee ($)
0.01–0.99

1.00–9.99

50.00–199.99
2.40
200.00–499.00
3.60
500.00 and up
4.80
If your item doesn’t sell, don’t think you can get your insertion fee back. 
It is nonrefundable. You do have the option of relisting your unsuccessful
auction without being charged a second listing fee, but only if your item 

Book III
Chapter 1
Be Sure Your
Listings Make 
Cents
Keeping an Eye on Where the Pennies Go
241
sells with the second listing. If it doesn’t sell the second time, you will be
charged again. Writing a better title, starting with a lower opening bid, or
adding a snappier description will help in selling the item. Maybe you should
think about changing the category as well.
Whether you’re listing one item with a starting bid of $1000.00 or 100 items
for $5.00 each in a Dutch auction, your insertion cost per auction is never
more than $4.80.
Reserve price auctions
In a reserve price auction, you’re able to set an undisclosed minimum price
for which your item will sell, thereby giving yourself a safety net. Figure 1-1
shows an auction in which the reserve has not yet been met. Using a reserve
price auction protects the investment you have in an item. If, at the end of
the auction, no bidder has met your undisclosed reserve price, you aren’t
obligated to sell the item and the high bidder isn’t required to purchase
the item.
For example, if you have a rare coin to sell, you can start the bidding at a low
price to attract bidders to click your auction and read your infomercial-like
description. If you start your bidding at too high a price, you might dissuade
prospective bidders from even looking at your auction, and you won’t tempt
them to even bid. They may feel that the final selling price will be too high
for their budgets.
Everyone on eBay is looking for a bargain or a truly rare item. If you can
combine the mystical force of both of these needs in one auction, you have
something special. The reserve price auction enables you to attempt — and
perhaps achieve — this feat.
Figure 1-1:
Wow! I bet
this auction
has a hefty
reserve!

Keeping an Eye on Where the Pennies Go
242
The reserve price auction is a safety net for the seller but often an uncom-
fortable guessing game for the prospective bidder. To alleviate buyer anxiety,
many sellers put reserve prices in the item description, allowing bidders to
decide whether the item will fit into their bidding budgets.
You can’t use the reserve price option in a Dutch auction.
Placing a reserve price on one of your auctions means that the item will not
sell until the bidding reaches the reserve price. When your reserve price
item does sell, two good things happen: You’ve sold your item at a profit
(let’s hear it for optimism!) and eBay refunds your reserve fee. Yeah! The
reserve fee is based on the reserve price you set, as outlined in Table 1-2.
Put your reserve price at the top of your listing description. That way,
there’s a good chance the buyers will know what they’re in for. You could
also offer free shipping in a reserve auction to take the edge off.
Minimizing eBay listing fees
eBay listing fees are based on your starting bid
price, or your amount for a fixed-price sale.
Although eBay listing fees have remained
somewhat stable over the years, in February
2004, eBay raised the rates and changed their
pricing levels. For a very long time, the most you
would pay to list a regular item on the eBay site
was $3.30. Now it’s $4.80.
For years, the base listing fee was $.30 for any
item priced from $.01 to $9.99. As Table 1-1
shows, the little guy (the seller with lower-priced
items to sell) takes a minor hit: the percentage of
starting price paid in fees. At least it looks like a
minor hit. But when you work in percentages
(and they’re what really count in retailing), that’s
a 16.6% increase over the original fee. Before
the rate increase in late January 2004, more than
12,000 listings started at $1 and had the word
antique in the title; sellers these days are moving
away from that approach. But many are still
stubbornly clinging to the $1 opening — or is it
that they don’t have the information you have.
Here’s why. . . .
If you’re planning to start your auctions at $1.00,
consider starting them at $.99 instead. You save
29% in listing fees! One seller I know made that
change to his auctions and saved $2400.00 a
month!
In February of 2005, eBay gave the little guy a
break and actually lowered the fee to list an item
under $.99 to $.25. Still, keep in mind that the
higher your starting price is, the higher your fee.
But when you work in percentages, there’s the
difference. Keep in mind that $0.25 is about 25%
of $0.99, while $4.80 is less than 1% of $500.00.
Perhaps (now you’re thinking) you can use a low
listing fee and tack on a reserve price. (There’s
news in the reserve area as well — those fees
are higher than before, but are refundable if the
item sells.) You can always work the reserve to
your advantage, but remember that bidders get
edgy (wondering whether they should spend
their time bidding on the auction and whether
they can get a better deal elsewhere) when they
see a reserve price auction.

The key here is to calculate, before you list your auction, whether it costs
you more in fees to use a reserve or to list with a higher starting price. The
following compares two completed auctions, without and with a reserve:

If your item doesn’t sell the first time with a low starting price and a reserve,
you can always relist it at a higher starting price without a reserve. If it sells,
the listing fees are still waived and you won’t have to pay a reserve fee.
eBay’s Optional Listing Features
eBay listings have many options and upgrades. Figure 1-2 shows how even
a random search on eBay listings can yield examples of some very popular
listing options.

eBay’s Optional Listing Features

When you come to the point in listing your item that brings you to eBay’s
optional listing features, you see the headline, “Get more bids with these
optional features! Make your item stand out from the crowd!” Sounds pretty
good, doesn’t it? But getting carried away by these options is easy and can
lead to spending all your expected profits before you earn them.
In eBay University’s Beyond the Basics (advanced selling) class, I quote auc-
tion success rates for the different features, but in the real life of your business,
success varies from auction to auction and category to category. If you take the
boldface option and then your auction appears in a category full of boldface
auction titles, the bold just doesn’t have the punch you paid for. Your auction
would stand out more without the bold option. It’s the same with highlighting.
Certain categories are loaded with sellers who go overboard in the use of the
highlighting feature — all the auction titles appear in a big lavender blur.
I recap the cost of the various eBay listing options in Table 1-3. Weigh the
pros and cons in terms of how these options affect your eBay business. Will
spending a little extra money enhance your item enough to justify the extra
cost? Will you be able to make the money back in auction profits? You must
have a good understanding of what the options are and when and how you
can use them to their fullest advantage.

In every auction you run, you have to pay an insertion fee for listing your
auction and a final value fee. If you accept credit card payments, you must
pay an additional fee to the payment service. Estimate your expenses from
these basics before you consider spending money for advertising. (See
“Totaling Fees with FeeFinder,” later in this chapter, for fee calculator soft-
ware that can help you make up your auction budgets.)
Home-page featured auctions
A user who goes to www.eBay.com first arrives at the eBay home page. A
Featured Items area appears in the middle of the home page; below this area
are links to six home-page featured auctions, as shown in Figure 1-3. When
you click the See all featured items link, the home-page featured items page
appears, as shown in Figure 1-4. Most of these items are fixed-price listings
that feature hundreds of items at a time. Many also feature items that list for
more than $1000.
The home-page featured auction option will set you back $39.95 for a single
item. If you have two or hundreds of widgets to sell, it’ll cost $79.95. For big-
ticket items, you’ve found the perfect location to draw an audience that may
easily earn back your $39.95. People who are new to eBay come in through
the front page; this is prime real estate. The six auctions featured on the
home page rotate at random throughout the day, but there’s no guarantee
that your listing will be among them.
If someone searches your keywords or browses through your category, auc-
tions featured on the front page appear at the top of the page (along with
Featured Plus auctions, which I describe next). But you must keep in mind
how much you’re paying for this option. Unless your auction will bring you
more than a few hundred dollars, this feature probably isn’t worth the addi-
tional cost.

Featured Plus
Featured Plus is an option I’ve used with much success. When you choose 
the Featured Plus option, your auction is listed at the top of the page when a
shopper searches for keywords or browses category listings. Although your
auction doesn’t appear on the eBay home page (see the preceding section), it
will appear at the top of your selected category’s home page (see Figure 1-5).
You get extra exposure for just $19.95, but you must still consider your auc-
tion budget. How much do you expect your item to sell for? Will the $19.95
expense benefit your auction enough to justify the expenditure? Be sure that
your item will bring you more than a few hundred dollars before choosing
this option.
Subtitle
You may use 55 characters for your item’s title. Title search is the de facto
search standard on eBay. From the statistics I’ve seen on my own auctions,
more than 90% of searches were made for title only, versus title and descrip-
tion. But how can you make your item stand out when it shows up with 
hundreds of other items that look the same? Use the subtitle option!
Figure 1-4:

Notice the subtitle under one of the auctions in Figure 1-6. This is your
opportunity to add additional text to your listing, readable by prospective
buyers as they scan a search or browse a category. It works very well if you
are one of several sellers selling the same item at a similar price — it sets
your listing apart from the others. A caveat: This additional text will be
picked up in a search only if the person chooses to search both titles and
descriptions. The additional text does not get pulled up in a title only search.
The fee for this is $.50.
When your item has something special about it or could use some extra
description, the subtitle option allows you more space to give the browsing
shopper vital information.
Highlight
I was excited when eBay announced the highlight option. Ever since
college, I can’t read a book without my trusty neon-yellow highlighter.
Highlighting makes anything stand out on a white page of text. This works
just as well on eBay as it does on paper — except eBay uses a lavender-
colored highlighter — ick!
Unfortunately, as with anything in life, less is more. If you choose to list 
your auction in a category in which all the sellers decide to use the high-
light option, the only listings that will stand out will be the ones without
highlighting.

The highlight feature will set you back $5. Does your budget allow for that?
To give your auction title a punch for a smaller amount of money, consider
the bold option or, even better, the border option.
Border
Using a border around your listing immediately draws attention to it when
someone is doing a search or browsing a category. At $3, it’s a deal com-
pared to the highlight, which costs $5. However, use this option only when
your expected final price warrants such an expenditure.
Listing Designer
eBay comes up with options to fill the needs (or wants in this case) of users.
Some sellers enjoy putting colorful graphics around their descriptions.
Listing Designer will include pretty graphics and help you design your
description, placing pictures in different places on the page. But if you have
a good description (creatively done with HTML color and emphasis) plus a
good picture (inserted creatively with the HTML code I give you in Book V),
your item will draw bids just the same as if you spent $.10 extra (per listing)
for the Listing Designer option.
If you want your descriptions surrounded by graphics, make sure they aren’t
too intensive. Otherwise, the pages will load too slowly for dial-up users.
Also, you can develop your own template or buy one from savvy eBay graph-
ics gurus who sell their services on the site.

You can use a graphics template to brand your listings on eBay, giving them
a uniform look. If you want to use a template, decide on one and make it
your trademark.
Boldface
The boldface option is one of my favorites and probably the most used
option in the eBay stable. An auction title in boldface type stands out in a
crowd, unless . . . you got it, unless it’s in a category loaded with boldface
auction titles. If the $1 that eBay charges for this benefit is in your auction
budget, odds are it will get you a good deal more views than if you didn’t 
use it.
Applying boldface to your item title spices it up and pulls it off the page right
into the reader’s eye. Unfortunately, bold adds an additional $1 to your list-
ing cost, so you better be in a position to make a good profit from the item.
Also make sure your research shows that it can sell for your target price.
View counter
Counters have become a popular free option in the online world. Placed 
on your auction by an outside service at your request, the counter ticks up
each time someone loads your page from eBay. A counter can impress bid-
ders and convince them they’re viewing a hot deal. It can also impress other
sellers to run out and sell the identical item.
A counter is a terrific tool for marketing your auctions — sometimes. If 
you have an auction with no bids and a counter that reads a high number,
newbie bidders may be dissuaded from taking a flyer and bidding on your
auction. Their thinking is, if that many people looked at this auction and
didn’t bid, something must be wrong with the item. They’ll tend to doubt
their own instincts as to what is and isn’t a good deal. In a situation such as
this, however, what might be going on is that savvy bidders are just watch-
ing your auction, waiting to bid at the last minute.
A private counter shields the numbers from the eyes of casual lookie-loos.
The figures are available only to you through a password-protected login
page. Private counters come in different flavors. Some of the most helpful
private counters offer a breakdown of visitors hour-by-hour. This type of
smart counter is available from several online services. eBay offers you a
free counter, but it’s not a smart counter.
Gallery photo
eBay bills the gallery as its miniature picture showcase, and indeed it is. 
By adding a gallery photo, a thumbnail image (80 x 80 pixels) of your item
appears next to your listing when the user browses the category view or

Book III
Chapter 1

Cents
eBay’s Optional Listing Features
251
search results, which can reap you many benefits. If you don’t pay the extra
$.35 to use the gallery image but still have a picture in your description, your
listing features only a lowly camera icon when searched.
Figure 1-7 shows how gallery items look in a search result. A gallery picture
may not be necessary if you’re selling a stock item that looks the same in
anyone’s listing, such as a CD, a book, or an electronic product.
Nothing draws the eye better than the gallery photo next to a listing in a
search with hundreds of results. Which auction would you check out? The
one with the tiny camera icon or the one with the crisp clear gallery picture
tempting you to open the listing? Pictures are the key to all quality advertis-
ing. Don’t miss an opportunity to add this extra little “billboard” to your 
listings.
eBay also offers to feature your gallery photo on the top of gallery-only pages
for $19.95. These photos run across the top of the page, as shown in Figure 1-8,
and are also larger (140 x 140 pixels) than regular gallery pictures.
When you take advantage of the gallery, be sure to crop your photo tight to
the subject. For more help with your images, see Book V.

Buy It Now
The Buy It Now feature, shown in Figure 1-9, has a few significant benefits. If
you have a target price for the item you’re listing, make that your Buy It Now
price. You can also use this option during frenzied holiday shopping times or
with hot items. Try posting a slightly higher than normal price and perhaps
you’ll get a bite, er, sale.
The Buy It Now feature disappears when someone bids on the item or, if
you’ve placed a reserve on the auction, when a bidder meets your reserve
price. You can’t use Buy It Now with a Dutch auction.
To use this feature, you must have a feedback rating of at least 10, have a
PayPal account in good standing, or be ID verified. (ID verify is eBay’s second-
ary form of identification, permitting you to participate on the site without
submitting a credit card.)
Buy It Now adds $.05 to a regular eBay auction and $1.00 to an eBay Motors
auction:

If your item will sell for a low price, remember my golden rule: Before paying
for a feature, ask yourself whether it’s in your listing budget.
eBay Picture Services
If you are shopping the site or even researching your competitor’s auctions,
you’ll notice that some sellers have a small picture of their item at the top of
their auction page. That picture is called the preview picture. What a great
selling point this is. The prospective buyers can see your item the second
they click the page! Best of all, there’s no additional cost to the seller.
You should definitely take advantage of this offer. Additional pictures (easily
uploaded to your item page) cost $.15 each. If you want the picture to super
size (get bigger) when the buyer clicks it, add an additional $.75 to your fees.
Always use the free picture — after all, it’s free! But why not save extra fees
by uploading your own additional pictures for your auction? See Book V for
full instructions on how to do this on your own without incurring any extra
charges.

Adding the Final Value Fees
254
Adding the Final Value Fees
eBay’s version of the Hollywood back-end deal is the final value fee. Big stars
get a bonus when their movies do well at the box office; eBay gets a cut
when your auction sells. After your auction ends, eBay charges the final
value fee to your account in a matter of minutes.
An ad in the Real Estate category is not charged a final value fee. Successful
auctions in the eBay Motors category are charged a flat final value fee. (See
Chapter 2 for information on fees in both categories.)
Even a rocket scientist would have trouble figuring out exactly how much
eBay receives at the end of your auction. To help you calculate how much
you’ll owe eBay, see Table 1-4.
Table 1-4 
Final Value Fees
Final Item Price
Final Value Fee
$.01–$25.00
5.25% of the selling price

$1000.00
$1000.01 and up
5.25% on the first $25, plus 2.75% on selling prices of 
$25.01 to $1000.00, plus another 1. 5% on selling prices over
$1000.00
Final value fees (FVFs) are charges on the sale price for your item and do not
include whatever you charge for shipping. Thank goodness eBay hasn’t
raised the FVF fees lately — they’re hard enough to calculate as it is! So how
do all these percentages translate to actual dollar amounts? Take a look at
Table 1-5, where I calculated the final value fees on some sample selling
prices.
If you try to work out your own final value fees, you may get an extreme
headache — and come up with fractional cents. Know that eBay rounds up
fees of $0.005 and more and rounds down below $0.005. These roundings are
performed on a per transaction basis and generally even out over time. For
more details, check out eBay’s account rounding explanation (perhaps a
strong cocktail would help while reading it) at
http://pages.ebay.com/help/account/rounding-account-balance.html

Table 1-6
Sample Final Value Fees
Closing Bid
To Find Your Final Value Fee
$0.01–$25.00
Multiply the final sale price by 5.25%. If the final sale price is
$25.00, you owe eBay $1.31 ($25 × 0.0525).
$25.01–$1000.00
You pay $1.31 for the first $25.00 of the final sale price. Subtract
$25.00 from your final closing bid and then multiply this amount
by 2.75%. Add this total to the $1.31. The sum is what you owe
eBay. If the final sale price is $1000.00, you owe $26.81 ($975 ×
0.0275) plus $1.31, or $28.12.
$1000.01 and over
You owe $1.31 for the first $25.00 of the sale price and $26.81 
for the price between $25.01 and $1000.00. This amount is $28.12.
Now, subtract $1000.00 from the final sale price (you’ve already
calculated those fees) and multiply that amount by 1.5%. Add
this amount to $28.12. The sum is the amount you owe eBay. If
the final sales price is $3000.00, you owe $30.00 ($2000 × 0.015)
plus $28.12, or $58.12.
If you’re starting to get dizzy just reading these examples, perhaps doing
your own calculations isn’t for you. It’s certainly not for me — this stuff
makes my eyes glaze over! Later in this chapter, I describe a cool software
program called FeeFinder that can handle all these calculations for you.
Because of the sliding percentages, the higher the final selling price, the
lower the commission eBay charges. Math can be a beautiful thing, when
applied to your benefit.
eBay doesn’t charge a percentage final value fee on an auction in the Real
Estate/Timeshares category as in other categories. You pay a flat FVF of $35
for Timeshares and Land and no FVF for Commercial or Residential. But in
the Automotive category, you pay a flat Transaction Services Fee of $40 for
vehicles and $25 for motorcycles if your auction ends with a winning bidder
(and the reserve has been met).
When selling a vehicle (car, truck, or RV) through eBay Motors, you’re get-
ting a great deal. Although you pay $40 to list your item, the transaction
services fee is only $40 when the item sells.
Selling Variations in Auctions
An auction is an auction is an auction, right? Wrong! eBay has four types of
auctions for your selling pleasure. Most of the time you’ll run traditional auc-
tions, but other auctions have their place, too. After you’ve been selling on

Selling Variations in Auctions
256
eBay for a while, you may find that one of the other types of auctions better
suits your needs. In this section, I review these auctions so that you fully
understand what they are and when to use them.
Traditional auctions
Traditional auctions are the bread and butter of eBay. You can run a tradi-
tional auction for 1, 3, 5, 7, or 10 days, and when the auction closes, the 
highest bidder wins. I’m sure you’ve bid on several and won at least a few.
I bet you’ve also made money running some of your own.
You begin the auction with an opening bid, and bidders will bid up your
opening price into a healthy profit for you (I hope).
Multiple-item (Dutch) auctions
When you’ve purchased an odd lot of 500 kitchen knife sets or managed
(legally, of course) to get your hands on a truckload of televisions that you
want to sell as expeditiously as possible, the multiple-item auction is what
you’ll want to use. In the multiple-item (Dutch) auction, which can run for 1, 3,
5, 7, or 10 days, you list as many items as you’d like and bidders can bid on
as many items as they’d like. See Figure 1-10 for an example. The final item
price is set by the lowest successful bid at the time the auction closes.
For example, suppose you want to sell five dolls on eBay in a multiple-item
auction. Your starting bid is $5 each. If five bidders each bid $5 for one doll,
they each get a doll for $5. But, if the final bidding reveals that two people

category.

Selling Variations in Auctions
257
bid $5, one person bid $8, and another bid $9, all bidders win the doll for the
lowest final bid of $5.
The following list highlights the details of the multiple-item auction:
✦The listing fee is based on your opening bid price (just like in a tradi-
tional auction), but the fee is multiplied by the number of items in your
auction, to a maximum listing fee of $4.80.
✦The final auction value fees use the same scale as in a traditional auc-
tion, but they’re based on the total dollar amount of your completed
auctions.
✦When bidders bid on your Dutch auction, they can bid on one or more
items at one bid price. (The bid is multiplied by the number of items.)
✦If the bidding gets hot and heavy, rebids must be in a higher total dollar
amount than the total of that bidder’s past bids.
✦Bidders may reduce the quantity of the items for which they’re bidding in
your auction, but the dollar amount of the total bid price must be higher.
✦All winning bidders pay the same price for their items, no matter how
much they bid.
✦The lowest successful bid when the auction closes is the price for which
your items in that auction will be sold.
✦If your item gets more bids than you have items, the lowest bidders are
knocked out one by one, with the earliest bidders remaining on board
the longest in the case of tie bids.
✦The earliest (by date and time) successful high bidders when the auc-
tion closes win their items.
✦Higher bidders get the quantities they’ve asked for, and bidders can
refuse partial quantities of the number of items in their bids.
Restricted access auctions
eBay won’t allow certain items to be sold in nonrestricted categories, so you
must list them in the adult only area of eBay. eBay makes it easy for the user
to find or avoid these types of auctions by making this area accessible only
after the user enters a password and agrees to the terms and conditions of
the area, as shown in Figure 1-11.
Items in the adult only area are not openly accessible through the regular
eBay title search, nor are they listed in Newly Listed Items. Anyone who 
participates in adult only auctions on eBay, whether as a bidder or a seller,
must have a credit card on file on eBay for verification.

Selling Variations in Auctions
258
Do not attempt to slip an adult only auction into a nonrestricted category.
eBay doesn’t have a sense of humor when it comes to this violation of policy
and may relocate or end your auction. eBay might even suspend you from
its site.
Private auctions
The eBay search page features an area where you can conduct a bidder
search. You — and everyone else including your family — can find the items
that you’ve bid on. One December my daughter told me that she didn’t want
a particular item — something that I had just bid on — for Christmas. My
creative daughter had been regularly perusing my bidding action on eBay to
see what I was buying for the holidays! A private auction would have kept
my shopping secret.
eBay private auctions don’t place bidders’ names on the auction listing. No
one needs to know just how much you choose to pay for something. As a
seller, you have the option (at no extra charge) of listing your auction as a
private auction.
The private auction is a useful tool for sellers who are selling bulk lots to
other sellers. It maintains the privacy of the bidders, and customers can’t do
a bidder search to find out what sellers are paying for the loot they plan to
re-sell on eBay.

PayPal Gets Its Cut
259
The private auction can save you the potential embarrassment associated
with buying a girdle or the tie that flips over to reveal a racy half-nude
female on the back.
Although the private auction is a useful tool, it may intimidate the novice
user. If your customer base comes from experienced eBay users and you’re
selling an item that may benefit by being auctioned in secret, you might want
to try this option.
PayPal Gets Its Cut
When you’ve sold your item, do you think that’s the end of the fees? Nope!
If your customer pays using PayPal, you’re faced with additional fees.
However, having a PayPal premier or business account is important for
building your commerce for these reasons:
✦eBay buyers look for the PayPal option because it offers them another
level of protection against fraud.
✦Most customers prefer to pay with a credit card, either to delay the
expense or to have complete records of their purchases.
✦From a seller’s point of view, using PayPal can be cheaper than having a
direct-merchant credit card account.
✦PayPal helps with your paperwork by offering downloadable logs of your
sales that include all PayPal fees. eBay fees are not included; you’re on
your own for those.
A business account requires the account to be registered in a business
name. A premier account allows you to do business under your own name.
Not quite adult enough. . . .
I was surprised to see a private auction listed on
one of my favorite eBay seller’s list. She usually
doesn’t sell items like “Fringe Black BRA 36B
SEXY SEXY SEXY,” so I looked through this
seller’s past auctions. I saw that she didn’t get
any bids when she listed the bra in the restricted
(adult only) area of eBay in the category
Everything Else: Mature Audiences: Clothing,
Accessory. When she put the bra up for private
auction in the category Clothing & Accessories:
Women’s Clothing: Lingerie: Bras: General, she
got five bidders and sold the item. I guess it
wasn’t sexy enough for the “adult” crowd!

Totaling Fees with FeeFinder

Check out Book II, Chapter 4, which covers the PayPal services and fees in
depth.
Totaling Fees with FeeFinder
I don’t have the time (or the inclination) to total the applicable fees and
expenses for every item I put up on eBay. But I do not recommend such 
laziness to anyone trying to earn a living on eBay.
To combat the laziness that I fear will drastically affect my bottom line, I use
a program called FeeFinder, which totals all the appropriate fees automati-
cally. I use this program to help make better business decisions on pricing
my items — and so can you! Here’s the drill:
1. Get and install a copy of FeeFinder.
For a free trial version (or to purchase it at a discounted rate), visit the
Web site at www.hammertap.com/coolebaytools and follow the
instructions you find there.
2. Click the Single Item or Multiple Items tab, input your price, and
choose the appropriate settings.
Four tabs are at the top of the FeeFinder page. First (as shown in Figure
1-12) is the Single Item page. The second tab performs the same task for
a multiple-item, or Dutch, auction.
3. Type your estimate of the closing bid and click Calculate.
I used my Buy It Now price.
4. Click the Payment Services tab, type the total price — including 
shipping — and choose the appropriate settings.
The Payment Services tab (see Figure 1-13) calculates your PayPal fees.
Just indicate which level of PayPal account you have and whether the
payment is an eCheck or a credit card. Type the total amount you’ll 
collect from the buyer — including shipping.
5. Click the Calculate button.
Your PayPal fees appear at the bottom of the page.
6. Add the two fees together and you have your total expenses for that
sale at the prescribed price.
A fourth tab, Shipping, has links to all the shipping calculators for all the
major shipping companies in the United States, the United Kingdom, and
Germany. There’s even a link to Freight forwarders to get estimates on items
too large to ship using regular resources.

Setting Sensible Shipping Costs
262
Setting Sensible Shipping Costs
Buyers who visit the eBay site are bargain shoppers. They want to get their
items at the lowest possible prices. They’re also more cognizant about the
“hidden” expense buried in the item’s shipping and handling fees. When you
set these fees, you must take into account every expense involved in your
packing and shipping. You can’t make your shipping area a losing proposition.
However, too many eBay sellers have increased their shipping prices to out-
rageous amounts. I’ll bet those sellers think they’ve found a cute way to save
a couple of cents off their final value fees (after all, final value fees aren’t
charged on shipping costs). But when the shipping fee equals a third of the
item’s cost, a prospective bidder may think twice about placing a bid. Of
course, if the item is big or the buyer wants it fast, he or she may feel better
about paying higher shipping costs.
Business is business, and when you’re on eBay to make a profit, every penny
counts. In this section, I tell you how to evaluate all the costs involved with
packing and shipping the items you sell. I also show you how to use the tools
at your disposal — such as eBay’s shipping calculator — to make the best
decisions about how much to charge your buyers for shipping costs.
For information on organizing your shipping area, be sure to read Book VII.
When calculating shipping costs, don’t assume that you have just the cost of
your postage. You also have per-item costs for boxes, padded mailers, ship-
ping tape, labels, and pickup or service fees from your carriers. Now and
again, you may even pay the college kid across the street five bucks to
schlep your boxes for you. Expenses show up in the strangest places.
In addition to adding up the packing and shipping supplies, you need to
amortize the monthly fees from any online postage shipping services. When
you occasionally pay for a pickup from the carrier, you need to add that
expense to the shipping charges, too. The following list runs down some
of the expenses involved:
Forewarned is smart
After you know all the fees involved in selling
your item, you can play around with the pricing
and figure out how much your Buy It Now (or
target selling) price should be. Remember to
include the following costs when pricing your
items:
 How much you paid for the item you want
to resell
 The Freight In amount (the cost of shipping
the item to you)
 The cost of shipping the item to your buyer

263
✦Padded mailers: Select an average-size padded mailer that works for
several of the types of items that you sell. Selecting an average size for
all your products works well because it’s cheaper to buy in quantity.
Even if a few of your items could fit in the next-size-down mailers, buying
the bigger size by the case gives you a considerable discount. Why keep
five sizes of mailers in stock in quantities of 100 if you don’t have to? If
you don’t use all the bigger ones, you can always sell them. And besides,
padded envelopes don’t go bad.
Don’t be misled by packaging suppliers’ claims of low-cost mailers. They
usually don’t include the shipping costs in these price estimates.
When you price your cost-per-piece, be sure to include (as part of your
cost) what you have to pay to get the item shipped to you. For example,
if you purchase your mailers — say #4s (91⁄2 x 141⁄2) — by the hundred,
they may cost you $.40 each. If you buy a case of 500, they may cost only
$.28 each. By buying in quantity, you save $.12 per mailing envelope! The
more business you do, the more significant the savings.
✦Packing peanuts: I must admit that storing all those packing peanuts is
a real drag. Here is where buying in bulk equates to a huge cost savings.
Including the shipping cost, you can purchase
4.5 cubic feet for $11.99 = $2.66 per cubic feet
10 cubic feet for $21.98 = $2.20 per cubic feet
20 cubic feet for $43.96 = $2.20 per cubic feet
As you can see, 10 cubic feet turns out to be the most economical deal —
due to the high amount that shipping adds to the equation. eBay sellers
who sell packing peanuts offer them for half what they cost when you
purchase them from a brick-and-mortar retailer. (That’s because a store
you can walk into has to use up square footage to store these babies,
which means a higher cost.)
Here, in a nutshell (sorry, I couldn’t resist), is my solution to peanut
storage. Fill a drawstring-type trash bag with peanuts, and then tie the
drawstring. Screw cup hooks into the rafters of your garage and hang
the bags from the rafters. You can store a bunch of peanuts there! Be
sure to recycle!
✦Packing tape: You need a stock of clear packing tape. The common size
for a roll is 2 inches wide by 110 feet long. The following eBay prices
include shipping:
6 rolls = $13.49 = $2.25 per roll
12 rolls = $20.27 = $1.69 per roll
36 rolls = $49.85 = $1.38 per roll
Again, compare prices before buying.

Setting Sensible Shipping Costs
264
✦Boxes: I won’t take you through the various costs of boxes because hun-
dreds of sizes are available. Shop eBay (but often the shipping prices are
too high), and also check out www.uline.com for boxes at reasonable
prices. For the example, let’s just say a typical box will cost $.38 each.
✦G&A (general and administrative) costs: For the uninitiated (translation:
you never had to do budgets at a large corporation), G&A represents the
costs incurred in running a company. But the principle is familiar: Time is
money. For example, the time it takes you to research the costs of mailers,
tapes, and boxes on eBay is costing you money. The time it takes you to
drive to the post office costs you money. You won’t actually put a figure
on this just now, but it’s something you need to think about — especially
if you spend half an hour at the post office every other day. In effect, that’s
time wasted. You could be finding new sources of merchandise instead.
✦Online postage service: If you’re paying around $10 a month for the con-
venience of buying and printing online postage, that’s an expense too.
If you ship 100 packages a month, that amortizes to $.10 per package.
If you’re questioning whether you need an online postage service, here’s
my two cents: Being able to hand your packages to the postal carrier
beats standing in line at the post office.

packing peanuts.

You can buy the “inside secrets” of eBay from lots of places. Some e-book
sellers try to convince you that only they have the surreptitious bits of
knowledge — gleaned from years (months?) of experience on the site — that
reveal what’s Really Going On. Truth be told, the online retail market changes
so quickly that eBay can barely keep up with it — the profile of the online
shopper changes constantly. How likely is it that anybody has the ultimate
answer? Sure, you hear mysterious rumors of the way to sure-fire profits
(cue up the Twilight Zone theme in the background). Start an auction at a 
certain day and time, and you’ll automatically make more money? Puh-leez!
The only one who rakes in profits with that information is the guy that’s sell-
ing it to you!
Strategies for Running Your Sales
I’ve interviewed many eBay high-volume sellers (called PowerSellers) and
almost all agree that popular eBay theories are bunk. However, the sellers
do have some practical preferences for when and how they conduct their
eBay transactions. This section gets to the gist of these preferences and the
corresponding practices.
Selling strategies
The basic plan for running an auction is the same for everyone, except for
decisions regarding the timing of the auction and the starting price. If you
speak to 20 eBay sellers, you’ll probably get 20 different answers about
effective starting bids and when to end your auction. Until you develop your
own philosophy, I’d like to give you the tools to make a sound decision.
You can also successfully promote your auctions online and offline, and
now you can legally offer your item to the next highest bidder if the auction
winner doesn’t come through with payment. I discuss a few of these ideas in
this section.

Strategies for Running Your Sales
266
The ideas in this technique come from my own experience and discussions
with current eBay PowerSellers. These ideas are merely suggestions of meth-
ods and starting points that work for others. You definitely need to test them
out and find out which practices work — for you and for the types of items
you sell.
Starting the bidding
The most generally accepted theory about starting bids is that setting the
bidding too high scares away new bids.
Some sellers begin the bidding at the price they paid for the item, thereby
protecting their investment. This is a good tactic, especially if you bought
the item at a price far below the current going rate on eBay.
To determine the current going value for your item, I recommend using the
completed auctions search, which I explain in Book II, Chapter 1. If you know
that the item is selling on eBay for a certain price and that there is a demand
for it, starting the bidding at a reasonably low level can be a great way to
increase bidding and attract prospective bidders to view your auction.
Years of advertising experience can’t be wrong. If your item is in demand and
people are actively buying, start the bidding low. Retail stores have done this
for years with ads that feature prices starting at $9.99 or $14.98. Even televi-
sion commercials advertising automobiles quote a low starting price. To get
the car as shown in the ad, you may end up paying twice the quoted price.
When sellers know that they have an item that will sell, they begin their bid-
ding as low as a dollar or even a penny. Because of the eBay proxy bidding
system (which maintains your highest bid as a secret, increasing it incremen-
tally when you’re bid against), it takes more bids (due to the smaller bidding
increments) to bring the item up to the final selling price.
The downside is that new bidders who aren’t familiar with the system may
bid only the minimum required increment each time they bid. This can be
frustrating, and they may quit bidding because it might take them several
bids to top the current bid placed by someone who is familiar with the proxy
bid system. Very few of us know the proxy increments by heart, so as a
refresher, I give you the goods in Table 2-1.

Auction length
Another debatable philosophy is auction timing. People are always asking
me how long to run auctions and what’s the best day to end an auction.
You have to evaluate your item and decide which of the following is the
best plan:
✦One-day auction: Did you just get a load of an item that sells as fast as
you put it on the site? Although a Buy It Now feature on any auction can
bring great results, that works only if the item is hot! hot! hot! If people
are bidding the item up — and they really gotta have it — you may do
best by starting the bidding really low and listing the item with a one-
day format.
When you list in a one-day format, your listing goes right to the top of
the list. Most people view their searches by auctions ending first. With a
one-day format, you can pretty much choose the time of day your item
will be at the top.
This format can be very successful if you have an item that’s the hot
ticket for the moment on eBay. I used this format when I sold some
Friends TV show memorabilia. The 24-hour auction opened midday
before the final show and ended the next day — at a healthy profit!
If the competition starts their auctions at $.99 with a reasonable Buy It
Now price, you’ll find that bidders foil many of their Buy It Now offers.
Retaliate by listing the item with a starting bid just a dollar or so below
your Buy It Now price (and make that price at least $.50 below the com-
petition’s) and you’ll find your items will be snapped up quickly.
✦Three-day auction: If, as in the heyday of Beanie Babies, the item’s price
will shoot up right after you post it, a three-day auction works just fine.
And it’s great for those last-minute holiday shoppers looking for hard-to-
find items.
A three-day auction is good, for the same reasons that a one-day
auction is good — only it’s better for the faint of heart and nervous
Nellies (like me) because it gives your item more time to sell.

Strategies for Running Your Sales
268
Another good use of a three-day auction is when you already have a
seven-day auction up on the site and the bidding is going crazy. You’ve
reached your sales goal by the middle of a seven-day cycle. Once the
seven-day auction is in the last couple of days of the listing, throw up a
three-day auction.
With the Buy It Now feature, you can pretty much accomplish the same
thing as a short-term auction. When you list your item for sale, set a
price at which you are willing to sell the item immediately; this is your
Buy It Now price.
✦Five-day auction: A five-day auction gives you two days more than a
three-day auction and two days less than a seven-day auction. That’s
about the size of it. If you just want an extended weekend auction or
your item is a hot one, use it. Five-day auctions are useful during holiday
rushes, when gift buying is the main reason for bidding.
✦Seven-day auction: Tried-and-true advertising theory says that the longer
you advertise your item, the more people will see it. On eBay, this means
that you have more opportunities for people to bid on it. The seven-day
auction is a staple for the bulk of eBay vendors. Seven days is long enough
to cover weekend browsers and short enough to keep the auction 
interesting.
✦Ten-day auction: Many veteran eBay sellers swear by the ten-day auc-
tion. Sure, eBay charges you an extra $.20 for the privilege, but the extra
three days of exposure (it can encompass two weekends) can easily net
you more than a dime in profits.
A ten-day auction is good for special collectibles or an expensive item
that normally doesn’t get listed on the site by the hundred. Putting up a
ten-day auction (start Friday night so you get exposure over two week-
ends) is a near-perfect way to attract bidders.
Your auction closes exactly one, three, five, seven, or ten days — to the
minute — after you start the auction. Be careful not to begin your auctions
when you’re up late at night and can’t sleep: You don’t want your auction to
end at two in the morning when no one else is awake to bid on it. If you can’t
sleep, prepare your listings ahead of time with the Turbo Lister program and
upload them for future launching when the world is ready to shop.
The specific day you close your auction can also be important. eBay is full of
weekend browsers, so including a weekend of browsing in your auction time
is a definite plus. Often, auctions that end late Sunday afternoon through
Monday close with high bids.
You’ll need to do some research to determine the best times to run your auc-
tions and for how long. In Book VIII, Chapter 3, I show you how to combine
your search engine research with a special kind of statistical counter to help
you identify the best closing time for your items. (See Chapters 1 and 2 in

Book III
Chapter 2
Understanding 
the Finer Points 
of Selling
Strategies for Running Your Sales
269
Book II for the details about using the search engine as a valuable research
tool.) The best person to figure out the closing information for your auctions
is you. Use the tools and over time you’ll work out a pattern that works best
for you.
Knowing what day to end an auction
Back when eBay counted its listings by the hundreds (then low thousands),
it clearly made a difference what day of the week you chose to end an auc-
tion. That is, when the number of buyers and sellers on eBay was relatively
small, matching your auction time with the bidders’ online habits was impor-
tant. Now that eBay spawns more than 13 million listings a day with countless
buyers and looky-loos visiting the site, you find the eBay netizens looking for
bargains at virtually all hours of the day and night. So for a traditional auc-
tion, you can choose almost any ending time and know that you’ll still have
some bidders.
The wildcards in the mix are the Buy It Now and fixed-price transactions,
which have become wildly popular. Although they don’t always follow a
daily pattern of sales, they can still follow the preferred auction-ending days
you find in this section.
To figure out when to end an auction, you need to know when to start it.
Figures 2-1, 2-2, and 2-3 are the top preferred timelines for running a sale 
on eBay.

You may notice that all these preferred datelines end on a Sunday. Sunday is
the top-ranked ending day for auctions by eBay sellers.
I can’t list everyone’s opinions on the subject — that would probably con-
fuse you anyway — so here are the item-ending days ranked in order from
most to least popular:

Pirates of the Caribbean, er, Carribean?
Just before the Pirates of the Caribbean movie
premiered, Disneyland gave out exclusive movie
posters to their visitors. My daughter, savvy
eBayer that she is, snagged several copies to
sell on the site. She listed them (one at a time)
when the movie opened and couldn’t get more
than the starting bid, $9.99, for each of them.
When we searched eBay for pirates poster, 
we found that the very same posters with a
misspelled title, Pirates of the Carribean, were
selling for as high as $30 each. We immediately
changed her auctions to have the more popular
(misspelling) Carribean in the title and quickly
saw those dollar signs! After selling out her ini-
tial stock, she found another seller who had ten
for sale — in one auction — with the proper
spelling in the title. She bought those as well
(for $5 each) and sold them with misspelled
titles in the listing for between $15 and $27!

Be sure to coordinate these dates with what you sell. Some buyers (say, men
who buy golf goods during lunch hour and women who buy collectibles
while their husbands are out golfing on weekends) can throw these days a
curve.
A definite time not to close your auctions? Experience has taught many sell-
ers never to close an auction on a national holiday. Memorial Day, the Fourth
of July, and Veteran’s Day may be bonanza sales days for retail shops, but
eBay auction items closing on these days go at bargain prices.
Knowing what time to start your auction
The only way to figure out when to end your auction is by planning when 
to start it. An auction beginning at 12:00 will end at that same time on the
ending day.
eBay time is military time in the Pacific time zone. Table 2-2 converts the
eBay clock to real time for your time zone. Make a photocopy of this table
and keep it by your computer. (Even after all these years, it still takes too
much time to decipher eBay time without a printed chart.)
If you ever need to check your time zone or want to know exactly what time
it is in eBay-land, point your browser to

and you’ll see the map pictured in Figure 2-4.

Making Money in Other eBay Zones
There’s more to eBay than just the auction site. Don’t lose a selling opportu-
nity by not checking into the other viable areas described in this section.
eBay’s half brother: Half.com
Half.com, founded in July of 1999, was the brainchild of Joshua Kopelman.
He observed the insufficiencies of retailing in the area of used mass-market
merchandise and went to work on developing a new outlet for second-hand
merchandise. Kopelman’s site was so successful that eBay bought out Half.com
after its first year of business. Half.com ranks as one of the Internet’s most
visited sites.
Selling at Half.com is different from selling at your eBay (or other online) 
personal store because you’re selling in a fixed-price marketplace. Your item
is listed head-to-head against more of the same item from other sellers.
Half.com isn’t a home for your store; you might say that each item has its
own store, complete with competing sellers.
The Half.com home page is shown in Figure 2-5. Half.com currently lists more
than 15 million items, including books, CDs, DVDs, video games, computers,
electronics, sporting goods, and trading cards. Because Half.com is part of
eBay, your feedback follows you to the site.
From a seller’s point of view, the best features of Half.com are these:
✦The item listing is free.
✦The item stays on the site until the item is sold or until you take it down.
Half.com charges a commission after your item sells, as shown in Table 2-3.
Commissions for items sold in the Books, Music, Movies, and Games cate-
gories are a percentage of the selling price of the item. The shipping cost 
is not added to the selling price. Commissions for items sold in any other
Half.com category are calculated as a percentage of the combined selling
price and shipping costs.

To list an item for sale at Half.com, you first need to locate the item’s
Universal Product Code (UPC) or, if you’re selling a book, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN). In case you’re wondering what an ISBN is,
turn this book over and find the bar code on the back. The number written
above it is this book’s ISBN number.
If you don’t want to bring all your books, CDs, movies, or games to your
computer, scan your items using an inexpensive handheld scanner (that
holds memory).
When someone searches on Half.com for an item, such as a book, a listing of
all sellers who are selling that book appears. The listings are classified by
the book’s condition — categorized as Like New or Very Good — depending
on what the seller entered. The list price of the book is included, as well as a
comparison of selling prices on the eBay site.
Figure 2-5:
The
Half.com
home page.

Book III
Chapter 2

the Finer Points

275
If you don’t have an item’s outer box with the UPC, search Half.com from any
of its pages for your particular item (including its brand name). When your
search comes up with the exact item, copy down the code number and use it
with your listing.
You’ll find that by using the UPC or ISBN in your listing, Half.com comes up
with an image of your item, so you don’t even have to take a picture for your
sale. When an item is out of print, Half.com may not have an image to upload
with the listing. In this case, the text Image not available appears in the area
where the picture would appear. (Half.com allows you to upload your own
picture.) If your item doesn’t have a code, you can upload your own photo
and even add a 1000-word description. Half.com has an amazing database of
items in electronics, sports, and other categories to help you find the specs
of whatever item you want to list.
When a prospective buyer searches and finds an item for books or coded
items, a box appears in the corner of the listing with a price comparison of
the item from various other online sales sites.
For example, if you’re selling a paperback book for $37.00, here’s what 
happens:
1. Buyer buys your paperback, which is priced at $37.00.
2. Half.com charges the buyer $2.79 for Media Mail shipping and handling
costs.
3. You pay Half.com a 15% commission, which is $5.55 on a $37.00 item.
4. You get a shipping reimbursement of $1.94.
See Table 2-4 for Half.com shipping reimbursements.
5. Half.com sends you a net payment of $33.39.

Automotive? Go eBay Motors
Anything and everything automotive can go in the eBay Motors category
(see Figure 2-6), and it will sell like giant tires at a monster truck rally.
Following are just a few of the car-related items that fit in this category.
Car parts
Got used car parts? eBay has an enormous market in used car parts. One
seller I know goes to police impound sales and buys wrecks — just to get
some valuable parts that he can resell on eBay.
New car parts are in demand, too. If your local auto parts store is blasting
out door handles for a 1967 Corvette (a vehicle for which it’s hard to find
parts), it wouldn’t hurt to pick up a few. Sooner or later, someone’s bound 
to search eBay looking for them. If you’re lucky enough to catch the trend,
you’ll make a healthy profit.

Cars
Yes, you can sell cars on eBay. In fact, used car sales have skyrocketed
online thanks to all the people who find eBay to be a trusted place to buy
and sell used vehicles. Selling vehicles on eBay is a natural business for you
if you have access to good used cars, work as a mechanic, or have a contact
at a dealership who lets you sell cars on eBay for a commission or on a 
consignment basis. (For the ins and outs of consignment selling, check
out Book IV, Chapter 3.)
To complete your sale, eBay Motors features a free passenger vehicle pur-
chase protection up to $20,000 (with a $100 buyer co-pay should you have 
a claim), one-click access to Carfax reports, vehicle inspection and escrow
services, and vehicle shipping quotes from Dependable Auto Shippers.
Access eBay Motors and its services from the eBay home page or by going
directly to www.ebaymotors.com.
Selling a car on eBay Motors is a bit different from selling on regular eBay,
mainly in the area of fees. Take a look at Table 2-5 for significant differences.

* There is no final value fee for selling on eBay Motors. Instead, you pay the transaction service fee
when your item gets a bid (or if you’ve used a reserve, when bidding meets your reserve price).
Although many people who have found the vehicle of their dreams on eBay
are more than happy to take a one-way flight to the vehicle location and
drive it home, shipping a vehicle is a reasonably priced alternative. You can
make arrangements to ship a car quickly and simply. In Table 2-6, I list some
sample costs for shipping cars around the country from various sites.
Here are just a few things to keep in mind if you plan to sell cars on eBay:
✦To sell a vehicle on eBay Motors, you must enter the Vehicle Identification
Number (VIN) on the Sell Your Item page. This way, prospective buyers
can access a Carfax report to get an idea of the history of the car.

eBay Motors.
✦If your reserve isn’t met in an eBay Motors auction, you may still offer
the vehicle to the high bidder through the Second Chance option.
More information on that later in this chapter. You may also reduce
your reserve during the auction if you feel you’ve set your target price
too high.
Live auctions
eBay also holds live auctions, where you’ll find rare and unusual items for
sale. You can access the live auction area from a link on the home page or by
going directly to www.ebayliveauctions.com. To sell on eBay Live Auctions,
you must be a registered, licensed auction house. eBay Live Auctions supply
nonstop, live auction action right on your desktop. Joining a live auction is a
great deal of fun. These auctions happen in real time; you can see (and partic-
ipate in) the bidding action on your screen as it’s happening.
Licensed auction houses run live auctions from their locations, which are
broadcast worldwide through eBay. You have to register individually for
each auction in which you want to participate, and a buyer’s premium is
involved. More and more auctioneers are using this format to expand their
customer bases.
As an eBay community member, you’re able to bid on items featured in live
auctions. As a matter of fact, while writing this chapter, I spent a few hours
bidding (and buying) in a coin auction! It’s a good way to increase your own
stock of merchandise to sell.
Real estate: Not quite an auction
eBay Real Estate at www.ebay.com/realestate isn’t quite an auction.
Because of the wide variety of laws governing the sale of real estate, eBay

Book III

auctions of real property aren’t legally binding offers to buy and sell.
However, putting your real estate on eBay is an excellent way to advertise
and attract potential buyers. When the auction ends, neither party is obligated
(as they are in other eBay auctions) to complete the real estate transaction.
The buyer and seller must get together to consummate the deal.
Nonetheless, eBay real estate sales are popular and the gross sales are grow-
ing by leaps and bounds. You don’t have to be a professional real estate
agent to use this category, although it may help when it comes to closing 
the deal. If you know land and your local real estate laws, eBay gives you 
the perfect venue to subdivide those 160 acres in Wyoming that Uncle Regis
left you in his will.
For less than the cost of a newspaper ad, you can sell your home, condo,
land, or even timeshare on eBay Real Estate in the auction format. You can
also choose to list your property in an ad format, accepting not bids but
inquiries from prospective buyers from around the world. On the Sell Your
Item form, you must specify special information about your piece of real
estate.
In Tables 2-7 and 2-8, I provide a listing of fees that you can expect to
encounter on eBay Real Estate.

Selling by the Rules
There are a lot of shoulds in this world. You should do this and you should
do that. I don’t know who is in charge of the shoulds, but certain things just
make life work better. If you follow the advice on these pages, your eBay
business will thrive with a minimum of anguish. If you’ve ever had an auction
pulled by eBay, you know what anguish truly feels like.
In the real world, we have to take responsibility for our own actions. If we
buy a television set for $25 from some guy selling them out of the back of a
truck, who do we have to blame when we take it home and it doesn’t work?
You get what you pay for, and you have no consumer protection from the
seller of the possibly “hot” TVs. Responsible consumerism is every buyer’s
job. Lawsuit upon lawsuit gets filed — and some are won — when someone
feels they’ve been ripped off, but my best advice is that if you stay clean in
your online business, you’ll keep clean.
eBay is a community, and the community thrives on the five basic values
below:
✦We believe people are basically good.
✦We believe everyone has something to contribute.
✦We believe that an honest, open environment can bring out the best in
people.
✦We recognize and respect everyone as a unique individual.
✦We encourage you to treat others the way that you want to be treated.
eBay is committed to these values, and it says so right on its Web site. eBay
believes that community members should “honor these values — whether
buying, selling, or chatting.” So should we all.
Is what you want to sell legal?
Although eBay is based in California and therefore must abide by California
law, sellers do business all over the United States. Therefore, items sold at
eBay must be governed by the laws of every other state as well. As a seller,
you’re ultimately responsible for the legality of the items you sell and the
way that you transact business on eBay. Yes, you’re able to sell thousands of
different items on eBay. But do you know what you aren’t allowed to sell?
The eBay User Agreement outlines the rules and regulations regarding what
you can and can’t sell as well as all aspects of doing business on eBay. If you
haven’t read it in a while, do so. You can find it at the following address:

Book III
Chapter 2
Understanding 
the Finer Points 
of Selling
Selling by the Rules
281
http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/user-agreement.html
These policies can change from time to time. As an active seller, you should
make sure that you’re notified of any changes. To request that you be noti-
fied when eBay makes changes to the User Agreement, as well as to control
any correspondence you receive from eBay, follow these steps:
1. In the My eBay Views section of the My eBay page, click the eBay
Preferences link under My Account. Then, next to Notification
Preferences, click the View/Change link.
Alternatively you can go to the following address:
http://pages.ebay.com/services/myebay/optin-login.html
2. Sign in with your user ID and password.
The Change Your Notification Preferences page appears.
3. Sign in again.
4. Scroll to the bottom of the page to find and read the legal notifications.
5. To receive important information that may affect how you run your
auctions, click the User Agreement Changes option and Privacy Policy
Changes option.
By now, you should have a firm grasp of the rules and regulations for listing
auctions. But in addition to knowing the rules for listing items, you must con-
sider the items themselves. In this section, I detail the three categories of
items to be wary of: prohibited, questionable, and potentially infringing.
Some are banned, period. Others fall in a gray area. You’re responsible for
what you sell, so you’d better know what’s legal and what’s not.
You may think it’s okay to give away a regulated or banned item as a bonus
item with your auction. Think again. Even giving away such items for free
doesn’t save you from potential legal responsibility.
Prohibited items
A prohibited item is banned from sale at eBay. You can’t sell a prohibited item
under any circumstance. Take a look at the following list. A little common
sense tells you there’s good reason for not selling these items, including 
liability issues for the seller (what if you sold alcohol to a minor? — that’s
against the law).

over 21.

Potentially infringing items
Potentially infringing items follow a slippery slope. If you list a potentially
infringing item, you may infringe on existing copyrights, trademarks, registra-
tions, or the like. Get the idea? These items are prohibited for your own 
protection.
Items falling under the potentially infringing category are generally copy-
righted or trademarked items, such as software, promotional items, and
games. Even using a brand name in your auction as part of a description
(known as keyword spamming) may get you into trouble.
Repeating various un-trademarked keywords can get you in trouble as well.
eBay permits the use of as many as five synonyms when listing an item for
sale. A permissible example of this might be: purse, handbag, pocketbook,
satchel, and bag. Adding many un-trademarked keywords would cause the
auction to come up in more searches.
Listing violations
eBay does not sell merchandise. eBay is merely a venue that provides the
location where others can put on a giant e-commerce party (in other words,
sell stuff). To provide a safe and profitable venue for its sellers, eBay must
govern auctions that take place on its site. eBay makes the rules; you and I
follow the rules. I like to think of eBay as the place that lets you hold your
senior prom in its gym. When I was in school, my classmates and I had to
follow the rules or see our prom canceled. If we don’t agree to follow eBay’s
rules, a safe and trusted eBay community can’t exist.

Book III
Chapter 2
Understanding 
the Finer Points 
of Selling
Selling by the Rules
285
Listing policies
eBay has some hard-and-fast rules about listing your items. One rule is that
you must list your item in the appropriate category (that only makes sense).
In this section, I highlight a few other rules that you should keep in mind
when listing. What I discuss isn’t a definitive list of eBay listing policies and
rules. Take time to familiarize yourself with the User Agreement (which
details all eBay policies and rules) at the following address:
pages.ebay.com/help/policies/user-agreement.html
I recommend that you check the eBay User Agreement regularly for any
policy changes.
Choice auctions
Your auction must be for one item only: the item that you specifically list in
your auction. It’s against the rules to give the bidder a choice of items, sizes,
or colors. eBay protects you with its purchase protection program, which
When alcohol becomes collectible
Many people collect rare and antique bottles of
liquor or wine. I even sold a bottle of Korbel
champagne designed by Frank Sinatra on eBay
in 1998. Korbel bottles have featured artwork by
designer Nicole Miller and comedienne Whoopi
Goldberg as well as designs by Tony Bennett,
Frank Sinatra, and Jane Seymour.
People also collect Jim Beam bottles, Dug
decanters, and miniatures that are even more
valuable when they’re full. You can sell these
on eBay as long as you fulfill the following
requirements:
 The value of the item is in the collectible
container, not its contents.
 The auction description should state that
the container has not been opened but any
incidental contents are not intended for
consumption.
 The item must not be available at any retail
outlet, and the container must have a value
that substantially exceeds the current retail
price of the alcohol in the container.
 Sellers should take steps to ensure that the
buyer of these collectibles is of lawful age
in the buyer’s and seller’s jurisdiction (gen-
erally 21 years old).

Selling by the Rules
286
covers all online eBay transactions. When you give your bidders a choice,
it’s an illegal sale on eBay and therefore not covered. Anything that’s negoti-
ated outside the eBay system can lead to either misrepresentation or fraud.
You don’t want to be caught up in that sort of grief and misery.
If eBay catches you offering a choice, they will end the auction and credit the
insertion fee to your account.
Duplicate auctions
Remember the old supply and demand theory from your economics class?
When people list the same items repeatedly, they drive down the item’s
going price while ruining all the other sellers’ opportunities to sell the item
during that time frame.
eBay allows you ten identical listings at any time. If you’re going to list an
item that many times, be sure to list it in different categories. That’s a rule,
but it also makes sense. Nothing drives down the price of an item faster than
closing identical auctions, one after another, in the same category. eBay also
requires that you list your auction in a category that’s relevant to your item.
If you have multiple copies of something, a better solution is to run a 
multiple-item (Dutch) auction for the total number of items you have 
for sale. Or perhaps run two multiple-item auctions in different (but appro-
priate) categories.
The Chanel-style purse
I once listed a quilted leather women’s purse
that had a gold chain strap, which I described
as a Chanel-style purse. Within two hours, I
received an informational alert from the eBay
listing police. I described the item to the best of
my ability, but found that it became a potentially
infringing item. My use of the brand name
Chanel caused my auction to come under the
violation of keyword spamming (more on that in
the section “Potentially infringing items”).
In its informational alert, eBay described my
violation:
“Keyword spamming is the practice of
adding words, including brand names,
which do not directly describe the item you
are selling. The addition of these words
may not have been intentional, but includ-
ing them in this manner diverts members to
your listing inappropriately.”
Ooops! You can see how my ingenuous listing
was actually a violation of policy. Think twice
before you add brand names to your auction
description. Thankfully, the eBay police judge
each violation on a case-by-case basis. Because
my record is clear, I merely got a reprimand. Had
my violation been more deliberate, I might have
been suspended.

Book III
Chapter 2
Understanding 
the Finer Points 
of Selling
Selling by the Rules
287
If you’re caught with more than ten identical auctions, eBay may end the
additional auctions (any over ten). eBay will credit the insertion fees.
Presale listings
eBay doesn’t like it when you try to sell something that’s not in your hands
(known as a presale listing). In many situations, being the first seller to put a
popular item up for sale can get you some high bids. And if you can guaran-
tee in your auction description that the item will be available to ship within
30 days of the purchase or the auction closing, you can run a presale.
However, if you’re not completely sure that you’ll have the item in time, I
don’t recommend that you even attempt a presale listing.
If you know that you’ll have the item to ship — and it won’t be lost on its
way to you — you may list the item with the following requirement: You
must state in your auction description that the item is a presale. You’ll
also have to use a little HTML here because the text must be coded with an
HTML font no smaller than font size 3. The presale policy also applies to
drop shipping.
The eBay Verified Rights Owner program
eBay can’t possibly check every auction for
authenticity. But to help protect trademarked
items, it formed the Verified Rights Owner
(VeRO) program.
Trademark and copyright owners expend large
amounts of energy to develop and maintain
control over the quality of their products. If you
buy a “designer” purse from a guy on the street
for $20, it’s probably counterfeit, so don’t go
selling it on eBay.
eBay works with VeRO program members to
educate the community about such items. They
work also with verified owners of trademarks
and copyrights to remove auctions that infringe
on their products. If eBay doesn’t close a sus-
picious or blatantly infringing auction, both you
and eBay are liable for the violation.
To become a member of the VeRO program, the
owners of copyrights and trademarks must
supply eBay with proof of ownership. To view
the VeRO program information and download
the application for membership, go to
http://pages.ebay.com/help/
confidence/vero-rights-
owner.html
Note: eBay cooperates with law enforcement
and may give your name and street address to
a VeRO program member.

Me pages, go to

Selling by the Rules
288
Before you set up such an auction, check out the Federal Trade Commission
30-day rule covering these matters, which you can find at the following
address:
www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/mailorder.htm
Bonuses, giveaways, raffles, or prizes
Because eBay sells to every state in the United States, it must follow explicit
laws governing giveaways and prizes. Each state has its own set of rules and
regulations, so eBay doesn’t allow individual sellers to come up with their
own promotions.
If your auction violates this rule, eBay might end it and refund your listing
fee.
Keyword spamming
Keyword spamming is when you add words, usually brand names, to your
auction description that don’t describe what you’re selling (for example,
describing that little black dress as Givenchy-style when Givenchy has 
nothing to do with it). Sellers use keyword spamming to pull viewers to
their auctions after viewers have searched for the brand name. To attract
attention to their listings, some sellers use not or like along with the brand
name, such as like Givenchy.
Keyword spamming is a listing violation and causes your auction to fall
under potentially infringing items for sale on eBay. The wording you choose
when you run this kind of auction manipulates the eBay search engine and
prospective bidders.
Preselling: Not worth the hassle
A seller I once knew presold Beanie Babies on
eBay. She had a regular source that supplied
her when the new toys came out, so she fell
into a complacent attitude about listing pre-
sales. Then her supplier didn’t get the shipment.
Motivated by the need to protect her feedback
rating (and by the fear that she’d be accused of
fraud), she ran all over town desperately trying
to get the Beanies she needed to fill her orders.
The Beanies were so rare that she ended up
spending several hundred dollars more than
what she had originally sold the toys for, just to
keep her customers happy.

Book III
Chapter 2

the Finer Points 
of Selling
Selling by the Rules
289
Keyword spamming manipulates the eBay search engine by including an 
unrelated item in the listing for a copyrighted or trademarked item, and then
diverting bidders to an auction of other merchandise. This is frustrating 
to the person trying to use the search engine to find a particular item, and 
unfair to members who’ve properly listed their items.
Keyword spamming can take many forms. Some merely mislead the 
prospective bidder while others are legal infringements. A few of the
most common are
✦Superfluous brand names in the title or item description.
✦Using something like “not brand X” in the title or item description.
✦Improper trademark usage.
✦Lists of keywords.
✦Hidden text — white text on a white background or hidden text in HTML
code. The white text resides in the auction HTML, so it shows up in the
search but is not visible to the naked eye. Sneaky, eh?
✦Drop-down lists.
To get the latest on eBay’s keyword spamming policy, go to
http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/listing-keywords.html
Linking from your auctions
Few issues set sellers to arguing more than eBay’s rules on linking. In your
auction item description, you can use the following links:
✦One link to an additional page that gives further information about the
item you’re selling
✦A link that opens an e-mail window on the prospective buyer’s browser
so that the buyer can send you an e-mail
✦Links to more photo images of the item you’re selling
✦Links to your other auctions on eBay and your eBay store listings
✦One link to your About Me page, besides the link next to your user ID
that eBay provides
Now here’s the “big secret” from one of those get-rich-quick, high-dollar eBay
seminars. You can link to your own, personal e-commerce Web site from
eBay. But only from your About Me page!

 Making changes after your auction has started
A
re you ready to make some money? Yes? (Call it an inspired guess.) Are
you on the threshold of adding your items to the hundreds of thou-
sands that go up for auction at eBay every day? Some auctions are so hot
that the sellers quadruple their investments. Other items, unfortunately, 
are so stone cold that they may not even register a single bid.
In this chapter, I explain all the facets of the Sell Your Item page — the page
you fill out to get your auction going on eBay. You get some advice that can
increase your odds of making money, and you find out the best way to posi-
tion your item so buyers can see it and bid on it. I also show you how to
modify, relist, and end your auction.
Getting Ready to List Your Item
After you decide what you want to sell, find out as much as you can about it
and conduct a little market research. Then you should have a good idea of
the item’s popularity and value.
Before you list your item, make sure that you have the following bases 
covered:
✦The specific category under which you want the item listed: Ask your
friends or family where they’d look for such an item and remember the
categories you saw most frequently when you conducted your market
research with the eBay search function.

Getting Ready to List Your Item
292
To find out which category will pay off best for your item, run a search
and then select the Completed Auctions option. See how many auctions
of that item are running (and if people are bidding on it). Then scroll
down to the left of the page and select the box next to Completed Items
and perform your search. Sort your results by highest prices first, and
then look over the auctions to see which categories they’re listed in. For
more information on how to get ahead of the crowd through eBay’s
search, visit Book I.
✦What you want to say in your auction item description: Jot down your
ideas. Take a good look at your item and make a list of keywords that
describe your item. Keywords are single descriptive words that can
include
• Brand names
• Size of the item (citing measurements if appropriate)
• Age or date of manufacture
• Condition
• Rarity
• Color
• Size
• Material
• . . . and more
✦Whether you want to insert a picture (or pictures) of your item inside
your description: Pictures help sell items, but you don’t have to use
them. (If you want to know more about using pictures in your auctions,
see Book V.)
✦The price at which you think you can sell the item: Be as realistic as
you can. (That’s where the market research comes in.)
The Sell Your Item form is where your auction is born. Filling out your auction
paperwork requires a couple of minutes of clicking, typing, and answering all
kinds of questions. The good news is that when you’re finished, your auction
is up and running.
Before you begin, you have to be a registered eBay user. If you still need to
register, go to Book I and fill out the preliminary cyber-paperwork. If you’ve
registered but haven’t provided eBay with your financial information (credit
card or checking account), you’ll be asked for this information before you
proceed. Fill in the data on the secure form. Then you’re ready to set up your
auction.

Just like the dizzying menu in a Chinese restaurant, you have four ways to
sell an item on eBay, as shown in Figure 3-1. Four ways may not seem to be
very dizzying, unless you’re trying to decide just which format is the best 
for you.
Here’s what you need to know about each type:
✦Online auction: This is the tried-and-true traditional sale format on
eBay. You can combine this auction with the Buy It Now feature, for
those who want the item immediately. Often, if you’re selling a col-
lectible item, letting it go to auction may net you a much higher 
profit — remember to do your research before listing.
✦Fixed price: Just like shopping at the corner store, a fixed-price sale is
easy for the buyer to complete. The only problem is that many potential
buyers may lean toward an auction because of the perception that they
may get a better deal.
✦Sell in your eBay store: Book VIII, Chapter 6 covers eBay stores — a
convenient place to sell items related to your auctions or fixed-price
items.
✦Advertise real estate: If you don’t want to put your property up for auc-
tion and you’d like to correspond with the prospective buyers, this is
the option for you.

Say, for example, that you want to list a good, old-fashioned eBay auction.
You want to sell your item for a fixed price but are also willing to let it go to
auction.
To find eBay’s Sell Your Item page from the eBay home page, you can use
either of these methods:
✦Click the Sell link on the navigation bar at the top of the page, and you’re
whisked to the Sell Your Item page. eBay allows you to select your cate-
gory and download the Sell Your Item page in seconds. This is the most
efficient method for listing a new item.
✦Start your auction from your My eBay page. Just click the All Selling link
and scroll down the page to Related Links. Click the More link, and a link
to the Sell Your Item page appears.
When listing your item, here’s the info you’re asked to fill out (each of these
items is discussed in detail later in this chapter):
✦User ID and password: If you’re not signed in, you need to do so before
you list an item for sale.
✦Category: The category where you’ve decided to list your item (required).
✦Title: The name of your item (required).
✦Description: What you want to tell eBay buyers about your item
(required).
✦eBay Picture Services or image URL: The Web address of any pictures
you want to add (optional). Note that you get a free preview picture at
the top of your auction. Book V has more information on using images 
in your auction.
✦The gallery: You can add your item’s picture to eBay’s photo gallery
(optional). eBay charges $0.25 extra to add the item to the gallery and
$19.95 to make your item a featured auction in the gallery. (You can find
more on the gallery later in this chapter.)
✦Gallery image URL: The Web address of the JPG image you want to place
in the gallery (optional). If you’re using eBay Picture Services, the first
photo you upload is resized for the gallery.
✦Item location: The region, city, and country from which the item will be
shipped (required).
✦Quantity: The number of items you’re offering in this auction is always
one unless you plan to run a multiple-item, or Dutch, auction (required).
✦Minimum bid: The starting price you set (required).

✦Duration: The number of days you want the auction to run (required).
✦Reserve price: The hidden target price you set. This is the price that
must be met before this item can be sold (optional). eBay charges you a
fee for this feature.
✦Private auction: You can keep the identity of all bidders secret with this
option (optional). This type of auction is used only in rare circumstances.
✦Buy It Now: You can sell your item directly to the first buyer who meets

✦List item in two categories: If you want to double your exposure, you
can list your item in two categories. Note that double exposure equals
double listing fees (optional).
✦Home page featured: You can place your auction in a premium viewing
section, with the possibility that your listing will cycle through the
direct links on the front page (optional). eBay charges from $39.95 for
this feature.
✦Featured Plus!: You can have your auction appear at the top of the cate-
gory in which you list it (optional). eBay charges $19.95 for this feature.
✦Highlight: Your item title is highlighted in the auction listings and search
listings with a lilac-colored band, which may draw eBay members’ eyes
right to your auction (optional). eBay charges $5 for this feature.
✦Border: Within the listings, your item will be surrounded by a bordered
box. Not a bad option for $3.
✦Boldface title: A selling option to make your item listing stand out. eBay
charges $1 for this feature (optional).
✦Free counter: If you want to avail yourself of Andale.com’s view coun-
ters, indicate so here (optional).
✦Ship-to locations: Here’s where you can indicate where you’re willing to
ship an item. If you don’t want the hassle of shipping out of the United
States, check only that option. You can select different countries as well
(optional).
You may want to consider whether you really want to be in the interna-
tional shipping business. Buyers usually pick up the tab, but you have to
deal with customs forms and post office paperwork. Depending on what
you’re selling, shipping internationally just may not be worth the invest-
ment in extra time. But remember that if you don’t ship internationally,
you’re blocking a bunch of possible high bidders.
✦Who pays for shipping: Select the options that apply as to who pays the
shipping and handling charges in your auction.

✦Shipping and handling charges: When prospective buyers know the
shipping cost in advance (assuming it’s a realistic price), they’re more
likely to bid right then and there. If they have to e-mail you with ques-
tions, they may find another auction for the same item — with reasonable
shipping — and bid on that one. Also, if you list the shipping charges on
the page, winning bidders can pay you instantly through PayPal. See
information on eBay’s handy shipping calculator, later in this chapter.
✦Payment instructions: Here’s the place you optionally put any after-sale
information. If you don’t want buyers to use Checkout, state that here. If
you want them to pay with a different payment service, mention that as
well. This information appears at the top of your sale when the sale is
completed, at the bottom of the auction while it’s active, and in the end-
of-auction e-mail.
✦PayPal and immediate payment: Fill out this area if you want to require
the high bidder to pay through PayPal immediately when using Buy It
Now. Add the Immediate Payment option if you know the shipping
amount and would like the winner to pay with a click of the mouse
(optional).
✦Escrow: If using escrow is an option you’d like to offer the high bidder,
(a good idea for high-dollar items), select the option indicating who will
pay the fees (optional).

Since I’m talking here about listing an item for sale, I’ll briefly go over some
high points on strategies — but be sure you also check out Chapter 1 to get
some serious insight on listing strategies.
Meeting your customers
eBay is a person-to-person marketplace.
Although many sellers are businesses (like you),
the perception is that sellers on eBay are indi-
viduals (versus businesses) earning a living. The
homespun personal approach goes a long way
to being successful when selling on eBay. One
of the reasons many buyers come to eBay is
that they want to support the individuals who
have the gumption to start their own small
enterprise on the site.
After you’ve written a brilliant title for your auc-
tion, prospective buyers click your listing and
scroll down to your description. Do they have to
dodge through pointless verbiage, losing inter-
est along the way? Or do you get right down to
business and state the facts about your item?

Yes, the Sell Your Item form looks daunting, but filling out its many sections
doesn’t take as long as you may think. Some of the questions you’re asked
aren’t things you even have to think about; just click an answer and off you
go. Other questions ask you to type information. Don’t sweat a thing; all 
the answers you need are right here. And later in this chapter, I talk about
optional stuff. After you select your main category, you land on the official
working portion of the Sell Your Item page.
Selecting a category
Many eBay sellers will tell you that selecting the exact category isn’t crucial
to achieving the highest price for your item — and they’re right. The bulk of
buyers (who know what they’re looking for) just input search keywords into
eBay’s search box and look for their items. Potential buyers, though, will
select a category and, just like when you go to the mall, peruse the items and
see whether one strikes their fancy.
On the first page of the Sell Your Item form, you need to select the main cate-
gory for your item.
With tens of thousands of categories, finding the right place for your item
can be daunting. You need to apply some marketing techniques when decid-
ing where to place your auctions. You can list an item in two categories, but
you have to pay double for that. Does your budget allow for it?
To find where other sellers have successfully sold items that are similar to
yours and see the prices the items sold for, you can perform a completed
item search from the More Search Options page. In the Search box, type your
item keywords, select the box to search Completed Listings Only, and indi-
cate to have your results sorted by highest prices first. After you have your
results, select the completed listings with the highest priced bids. At the top
of the auction page, you’ll see the listed category. You may find that your
item is listed successfully in more than one category.
Also check the active listings; are lots of people selling your item? If you see
that you’re one of forty or fifty selling the item, you need to get creative as to
where to list your item. Evaluate the item and its potential buyers. In what
categories would someone shopping for your item search?
Here’s where your creativity can come into play. Who says that a box of Blue
Dog (the famous doggie icon painted by Cajun artist George Rodrigue) note-
cards belongs in Everything Else: Gifts & Occasions: Greeting Cards: Other
Cards. If you use the Find Suggested Categories tool (in a yellow shaded box)
in the upper-right corner of the Select Category area, you may find some
other creative places to list your item.

As part of the Sell Your Item form, eBay gives you a tool to find where the
bulk of sellers are selling your item. Put your keywords in the Find a Category
box and click Search. Figure 3-2 shows you how easy it is to select a main 
category.
You can also select your own category by using the standard category selec-
tion tool. eBay offers you a wealth of choices in a handy point-and-click way.
If you’re unfamiliar with the types of items you can actually find in those cat-
egories, you may want to check out the category before you choose one to
describe your item. Figure 3-3 shows you how to narrow down the subcate-
gory listings on the Sell Your Item page.
To select a category, here’s the drill:
1. Click one of the main categories.
On the next page, you see a list of subcategories.
2. Select the most appropriate subcategory.
3. Continue selecting subcategories until you’ve narrowed your item list-
ing as much as possible.
You know you’ve come to the last subcategory when you don’t see any
more right-pointing arrows in the category list.

Most bidders scan for specific items in subcategories. For example, if you’re
selling a Bakelite fruit pin, don’t just list it under Jewelry; keep narrowing
your choices. In this case, you can put it in a costume jewelry category
that’s especially for Bakelite. I guarantee that the real Bakelite jewelry collec-
tors out there know where to look to find the jewelry they love. eBay makes
it easy to narrow the category of your item: Just keep clicking until you hit
the end of the line.
If you’ve chosen to list an item, bid on an item, or even just browse in the
Everything Else: Mature Audiences category, you need to follow separate,
specific guidelines because that category contains graphic nudity or sexual
content that may offend some community members. You must
✦Be at least 18 years of age (but you already know that all eBay cus-
tomers must be 18 or older)
✦Have a valid credit card
✦Complete a waiver stating that you’re voluntarily choosing to access
adult-only materials
If you have adult or erotica items that you’d like to sell in a private auction,
see the “I want to be alone: The private auction” section, later in this 
chapter.

Listing your items in two categories
Suppose you’ve found two perfect categories in which to list your item. eBay
allows you to list an item in two categories, but does that mean it’s the best
marketing decision for your auction? That depends. When you list an item 
in two categories, you must pay two listing fees. Depending on the time, the
season, the availability of your item, and how much you paid for it, you may
Finding where to sell your stuff
The Internet is crowded with auctions. Every
major portal seems to now include auctions as
part of its site. The bottom line is that most bid-
ders and sellers go to eBay. Why? Because
more computers and electronics are sold on
eBay than at Buy.com; more used cars are sold
on eBay than at Autotrader; and more toys are
probably sold at eBay than at KBKids. Even the
United States post office has found a niche on
eBay, selling the contents of undeliverable
packages in odd lots.
Whether you’re selling auto parts, toys, fine art,
or land, you too must find your niche on eBay.
Sounds easy enough. After all, deciding where
to put your stuff for sale is straightforward,
right? Not necessarily. After taking a look at the
eBay Category Overview page, you can see
that the inclusion of more than 8000 subcate-
gories complicates this task.
Consider the example of a Star Trek toy. Star
Trek toys are becoming increasingly popular
with the continuing saga in the new series and
movies. The easy choice is to list the item under
Toys: Bean Bag Plush: Action Figures: Star Trek.
But what about the category Collectibles: Pop
Culture: Science Fiction: Star Trek? This is the
point where you must decide whether you want
to list in two categories (and pay more) or count
on the fact that your beautifully written auction
title will drive those using the search engine
directly to your item.
So you aren’t into selling Star Trek toys?
Suppose you’re selling a VHS of the movie 
The Red Violin. Would listing it in Movies:
Videos: General be the right choice? Or would
you hit the proper audience of category
browsers in Music: Musical Instruments: String:
Violin, Viola? A book on 1960s fashion? Better in
Books: Antiquarian, Rare: General or in Books:
Nonfiction: Collectibles? Actually I have my 
best luck going directly to the fans of ‘60s fash-
ion in the category Collectibles: Vintage Clothing,
Accessories: Clothing: Women: Other Women’s
Clothing.
Believe it or not, popularity of categories varies
from time to time. Potential buyers may search
one category more than others, and their pref-
erences depend on which way the wind blows.
News stories, the time of year, hot trends, or
whether Katie Couric makes a comment about
something can change a particular category’s
popularity. Keeping up on these trends is some-
times tough, so you must do some research.
So how can you possibly know the best cate-
gory for your item? Research your items on a
regular basis by using my favorite tool: the awe-
some eBay search engine. After you’ve found
the right category for the item you’re listing, give
it a try. But be sure to occasionally try alterna-
tives as well because the popularity of different
areas of the site can come and go with time.

or may not have the budget for listing an item twice. In addition, many eBay
buyers are savvy in their use of the search engine. If they search for your
item by using the search engine rather than by browsing the categories, list-
ing the item in two categories might be a needless expense.
You can change your category midauction, starting it in one category and
ending it in another. And at the end of an auction in which your item doesn’t
sell, you can use the relisting feature to run the auction again in another 
category.
Even when you’ve been selling a particular item for a while — and doing well
with it — you might be surprised to hear that changing to another related
category can boost your sales. A little research now and then can go a long
way to increasing your eBay sales.
Creating the perfect item title
After you figure out what category you want to list in, eBay wants to get
down to the nitty-gritty — what the heck to call that thing you’re trying
to sell.
Think of your item title as a great newspaper headline. The most valuable real
estate on eBay is the 55-character title of your item. The majority of buyers 
do title searches (in my research, around 94% of searches are performed by
title only), and that’s where your item must come up to be sold! So the onus 
is on you to give the most essential information right away to grab the eye 
of the reader who’s just browsing. Be clear and informative enough to get
noticed by eBay’s search engine. Figure 3-4 shows examples of good titles.
Note how some sellers beefed up the titles by using the Subtitle option.
Here are some ideas to help you write your item title:
✦Use the most common name for the item.
✦If the item is rare or hard to find, mention that.
Figure 3-4:
These item
titles are
effective
because
they’re
clear,
concise,
and easy on

Filling in Required Blanks
302
✦Mention the item’s condition and whether it’s new or old.
✦Mention the item’s special qualities, such as its style, model, or edition.
✦Avoid fancy punctuation or unusual characters, such as $, hyphens, and
L@@K, because they just clutter up the title — buyers rarely search for
them.
Don’t put any HTML tags in your title. (HTML stands for HyperText Markup
Language, which in plain English means that it’s the special code you use to
create Web pages.) As a matter of fact, despite what you may have been told,
you don’t need an extensive knowledge of HTML to have successful, good-
looking auctions on eBay. Later in the chapter, I list a few HTML codes to use
in your description. And in Book V, I give you some serious HTML tutoring
and tips on where you can find some easy programs that produce the minor
HTML coding that you may want to use to dress up your auctions.
Ordinarily, I don’t throw out French phrases just for the fun of it. But when
making a profit is an issue, I definitely have to agree with the French that
choosing or not choosing le mot juste can mean the difference between
having potential bidders merely see your auction and having an all-out bid-
ding war on your hands. Read on for tips about picking the best words to let
your auction item shine.
Look for a phrase that pays
Here’s a crash course in eBay lingo that can help bring you up to speed on
attracting buyers to your auction. The following words are used frequently in
eBay auctions and can do wonders to jump-start your title:
✦Mint
✦One of a kind (OOAK)
✦Vintage
✦Collectible
✦Rare
✦Unique
✦Primitive
✦Well-loved
There’s a science to figuring out the value of a collectible (called grading).
Do your homework before you assign a grade to your item. If you need more
information on what these grades actually mean, Book II, Chapter 2 provides
a translation.

eBay lingo at a glance
The common terms and the phrases just mentioned aren’t the only market-
ing standards you have at your eBay disposal. As eBay has grown, so has 
the lingo that members use as shortcuts to describe their merchandise.
Table 3-1 gives you a handy list of common abbreviations and phrases used
to describe items. (Hint: Mint means “may as well be brand new,” not “cool
chocolate treat attached.”)
Using titles to get eyes on your listing
Keywords! Keywords! Keywords! I can’t stress
enough that keywords are essential in your
title. Keywords are single words that people
would naturally use to search for an item. For
example, if you’re selling a shirt, common key-
words for your title might include
 Color
 Size
 Fabric
 Mens, womens, or childs
 Manufacturer’s name
 Is the item NWT (New With Tags)?
Another great place to find common keywords
searched for on eBay is in eBay’s fairly hidden
directory of keywords, which is shown in the
figure. You can find this page at http://key
word-index.ebay.com/a-1.html. In addi-
tion, some super programs will check your auc-
tions to see which keywords are doing the best
job for you. Check out Book VIII for the skinny.

NR
No Reserve Price
A reserve price is the price you can set when
you begin your auction. If bids don’t meet the
reserve, you don’t have to sell. Many buyers
don’t like reserve prices because they don’t
think that they can get a bargain. (For tips on
how to allay these fears and get bids in reserve
price auctions, see the “Writing your descrip-
tion” section.) If you’re not listing a reserve for
your item, be sure to let bidders know.
NWT
New with Tags 
An item, possibly apparel, is in new condition
with the tags from the manufacturer still
affixed.
HTF, OOP
Hard to Find, Out of Print
Out of print, only a few ever made, or people
grabbed up all there were. (HTF doesn’t mean
you spent a week looking for it in the attic.)
Normally, you can rely on eBay abbreviations to get your point across, but
make sure that you mean it and that you’re using it accurately. Don’t label
something MIB (Mint in Box) when it looks like it’s been Mashed in Box.

Don’t let your title ruin your auction
Imagine going to a supermarket and asking where you can find the stringy
stuff that you boil instead of asking where the spaghetti is. You might end 
up with mung bean sprouts — delicious to some but hardly what you had in
mind. That’s why you should check and recheck your spelling. Savvy buyers
use the eBay search engine to find merchandise; if the name of your item is
spelled wrong, the search engine can’t find it. Poor spelling and incompre-
hensible grammar also reflect badly on you. If you’re in competition with
another seller, the buyer is likelier to trust the seller hoo nose gud speling.
In my travels, I meet so many interesting people with lots of great stories
about their forays on eBay. One of my favorites is the story told to me by a
lovely lady in Salt Lake City. She brought to my class her biggest eBay bar-
gain. She won a Shaquille O’Neill signed basketball on eBay for 1 cent! Yep,
one red cent (plus shipping). I’ll bet that seller had a rude surprise when his
listing closed! Oh, you want to know why such a valuable collectible sold for
so little? The seller couldn’t spell Shaquille and listed the item as Schackeel.
If you’ve finished writing your item title and you have spaces left over, please
fight the urge to dress the title up with lots of exclamation points and aster-
isks. No matter how gung-ho you are about your item, the eBay search engine
may overlook your item if the title is encrusted with meaningless **** and !!!!
symbols. If bidders do see your title, they may become annoyed by the virtual
shrillness and ignore it anyway!!!!!!!! (See what I mean?)
Another distracting habit is overdoing capital letters. To buyers, seeing
everything in caps is LIKE SEEING A HYSTERICAL SALESPERSON SCREAMING
AT THEM TO BUY NOW! All that is considered shouting, which is rude and
tough on the eyes. Use capitalization SPARINGLY, and only to finesse a par-
ticular point or feature.
Giving the title punch with a subtitle
A new feature on eBay is the availability of subtitles. eBay allows you to buy an
additional 55 characters, which will appear under your item title in a search.
The fee for this extra promotion is $0.50, and in a few circumstances, it is defi-
nitely worth your while. Any text that you input will really make your item
stand out in the crowd — but (you knew there would be a but didn’t you?)
these additional 55 characters won’t come up in a title search. So if you have
all those words in your description, the words will be found either way with 
a title and description search. Keep in mind that a subtitle essentially doubles
your listing fee.
Writing your description
After you hook potential bidders with your title, reel ’em in with a fabulous
description. Don’t think Hemingway here; think infomercial (the classier the
better). Figure 3-5 shows a concise description of a silver dollar for sale. You

Filling in Required Blanks
306
can write a magnificent description, as well — all you have to do is click the
box and start typing.
Here’s a list of suggestions for writing an item description:
✦Write a factual description. Do you carefully describe the item, stating
every fact you know about it? Do you avoid the use of jargon? Does the
description answer almost any question a potential buyer might ask? If
not, do some revising.
✦Accentuate the positive. Be enthusiastic when you list all the reasons
everyone should bid on the item. Unlike the title, the description can
take up as much space as you want. Even if you use a photo, be precise
in your description — tell the reader, for example, the item’s size, color,
and fabric. Refer to “Creating the perfect item title,” earlier in this chap-
ter, for ideas on what to emphasize.
✦Include the negative. Don’t hide the truth of your item’s condition.
Trying to conceal flaws costs you in the long run: You’ll get tagged with
bad feedback. If the item has a scratch, a nick, a dent, a crack, a ding, 
a tear, a rip, missing pieces, replacement parts, faded color, dirty
smudges, or a bad smell (especially if cleaning might damage the item),
mention it in the description. If your item has been overhauled, rebuilt,
repainted, or hot-rodded (say, a “Pentium computer” that was a 386 till
you put in the new motherboard), say so. You don’t want the buyer to
send back your merchandise because you weren’t truthful about imper-
fections or modifications. This type of omission can lead to a fraud
investigation.

✦Include some friendly banter. You want to make the customer feel com-
fortable shopping with you. Don’t be afraid to let your personality show!
✦Update your My eBay page. Let people know a little about you and who
they’re dealing with. When customers have to decide between two people
selling the same item and all else is equal, they’ll place their bid with the
seller who makes them feel secure.
✦Limit the number of auction rules (or terms of sale). Some sellers
include a list of rules that’s longer than the item’s description. Nothing
turns off a prospective buyer like paragraph after paragraph of rules and
regulations. If you really must put in a litany of rules, use the following
bit of HTML to make the size of the text smaller: <font size=-1>.
✦Choose a reasonable typeface size. Many users are still looking at eBay
on an 800 x 600 display. If you design your auctions at 1024 x 768, your
typefaces may be way too large for the average user. Forcing a user to
scroll leads to frustrated customers.
✦Quote a shipping amount. Many bidders pass up auctions that don’t
disclose the shipping charges. Make use of eBay’s shipping calculator to
give your customers a fair shake at the shipping costs. If many others
are selling the same item you’re selling, quoting reasonable shipping
costs will help you reel in a buyer.
✦Keep photos a practical size. Most users still connect with a dial-up
Internet connection, and if they have to wait more than a few seconds
for your large pictures to load, they may go elsewhere for the item.
✦Be precise about all the logistical details of the postauction transac-
tion. Even though you’re not required to list any special S&H (shipping
and handling) or payment requirements in your item description, the
majority of eBay users do. Try to figure out the cost of shipping the item
in the United States and add that to your description. If you offer ship-
ping insurance, add it to your item description.
✦Promote yourself too. As you accumulate positive feedback, tell poten-
tial bidders about your terrific track record. Add statements like “I’m
great to deal with. Check out my feedback section.” You can even take it
a step further by inviting prospective bidders to your About Me page
(where you may also include a link to your personal Web site — if you
have one).
✦Be concise and to the point — don’t ramble! As my sixth grade English
teacher user to say, “Make it like a woman’s skirt: long enough to cover
the subject, yet short enough to keep it interesting.” Too many sellers
these days drone on and on, causing bidders to have to scroll down the
page several times. You can quickly lose your audience this way. They’ll
look for a listing with a less complicated look.

Filling in Required Blanks
308
✦Wish your potential bidders well. Communication is the key to a good
transaction, and you can set the tone for your auction and postauction
exchanges by including some simple phrases that show your friendly
side. Always end your description by wishing bidders good luck, inviting
potential bidders to e-mail you with questions, and offering the option of
providing additional photos of the item if you have them.
When you input your description, you have the option of jazzing things up
with a bit of HTML coding, or you can use eBay’s HTML text editor, described
in Book V, Chapter 3. If you know how to use a word processor, you’ll have no
trouble touching up your text with this tool. Table 3-2 shows you a few HTML

Occasionally, sellers offer an item as a presell. These sellers are either drop-
shipping an item or don’t yet have the item in stock but expect to have it. If
you’re offering this kind of item, make sure that you spell out the details in
the description. eBay policy states that you must ship a presell item within 30
days of the auction’s end, so be sure you’ll have the item within that time span.
Don’t forget to include the actual shipping date. I have found that putting an
item up for sale without having it in hand is a practice fraught with risk. The
item you’re expecting may not arrive in time or may arrive damaged. I’ve heard
of one too many sellers who have had to go out and purchase an item at retail
for a buyer to preserve their reputation when caught in this situation. By the
way, this is not only eBay’s regulation. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
calls this the 30-day rule, and they are serious about enforcing it.

Unless you’re planning on holding a multiple-item (Dutch) auction, the number
of items is always 1, which means you’re holding a traditional auction. If you
need to change the quantity from 1, just type the number in the box.
A matching set of cuff links is considered one item, as is the complete 37-
volume set of The Smith Family Ancestry and Genealogical History since 1270.
If you have more than one of the same item, I suggest that you sell the items
one at a time, because you will more than likely get higher final bids for your
items when you sell them individually.
Whether you list your items individually in auctions or together in a multiple-
item auction, eBay won’t allow you to list the same item in more than ten auc-
tions at one time.
Setting a minimum bid — how low can you go?
What do a baseball autographed by JFK, a used walkie-talkie, and a Jaguar
sports car have in common? They all started with a $1 minimum bid. eBay
requires you to set a minimum bid, the lowest bid allowed in an auction. You
may be surprised to see stuff worth tens of thousands of dollars starting at
just a buck. These sellers haven’t lost their minds. Neither are they worried
someone could be tooling down the highway in a $100,000 sports car for the
price of a burger.
Setting an incredibly low minimum (just type it in the box without the dollar
sign but with the decimal point) is a subtle strategy that gives you more bang
for your buck. You can use a low minimum bid to attract more bidders who
will, in turn, drive up the price to the item’s real value — especially if, after
doing your research, you know that the item is particularly hot. If you’re
worried about the outcome of the final bid, you can protect your item by
using a reserve price (the price the bidding needs to reach before the item
can be sold). Then you won’t have to sell your item for a bargain-basement
price because your reserve price protects your investment. The best advice

Filling in Required Blanks

is to set a reserve price that is the lowest amount you’ll take for your item
and then set a minimum bid that is ridiculously low. However, use a reserve
only when absolutely necessary because some bidders pass up reserve auc-
tions. (For more info about setting a reserve price, see the section “Your
secret safety net — reserve price,” later in this chapter.)
Starting with a low minimum is also good for your pocketbook. eBay charges
the seller an insertion, or placement, fee based on your opening bid. If you
keep your opening bid low and set no reserve, you get to keep more of your
money. (See Chapter 1 for more about eBay fees.)
The more bids you get, the more people will want to bid on your item because
they perceive it as hot. A hot item with lots of bids draws even more bidders
the way a magnet attracts paper clips.
Before you set a minimum bid, do your homework and make some savvy
marketing decisions. If your auction isn’t going as you hoped, you could end
up selling Grandma Ethel’s Ming vase for a dollar. See “Making Midcourse
Corrections,” later in this chapter, on how you can make changes in your list-
ing if you’ve made some egregious error.
When putting in your minimum bid, type only the numbers and a decimal
point. Don’t use a dollar sign ($) or a cent sign (¢).
Buy It Now
eBay’s Buy It Now (BIN in eBay-speak) is available for single-item auctions.
This feature allows buyers to purchase an item now. Have you ever wanted
an item really badly and you didn’t want to wait until the end of an auction?
If the seller offers Buy It Now, you can purchase that item immediately. Just
specify the amount the item can sell for in the Buy It Now price area — the
amount can be whatever you want. If you choose to sell a hot item during
the holiday rush, for example, you can make the BIN price as high as you
think it can go. If you just want the item to move, make your BIN price the
average price you see the item go for on eBay.
When your item receives a bid, the BIN option disappears and the item goes
through the normal auction process. If you have a reserve price on your
item, the BIN feature doesn’t disappear until a bidder meets your reserve
price through the normal bidding process. To list an item with Buy It Now,
you must have a feedback of 10 or be ID verified.
Setting your auction time
Although I discuss auction length in depth in Chapter 2, it’s important to
mention a bit more here. eBay gives you a choice of auction length: 1, 3, 5, 7,
or 10 days. Just click the number you want in the box. If you choose a 10-day
auction, you add $0.10 to your listing fee.

My auction-length strategy depends on the time of year and the item I’m sell-
ing, and I generally have great success. If you have an item that you think
will sell pretty well, run a 7-day auction (be sure to cover a full weekend) so
bidders have time to check it out before they decide to bid. However, if you
know that you have a red-hot item that’s going to fly off the shelves — such
as a rare toy or a hard-to-get video game — choose a 3-day auction. Eager
bidders tend to bid higher and more often to beat out their competition if
the item’s hot and going fast. A 3-day auction is long enough to give trendy
items exposure and ring up bids.
No matter how many days you choose to run your auction, it ends at exactly
the same time of day as it starts. A 7-day auction that starts on Thursday at
9:03:02 a.m. ends the following Thursday at 9:03:02 a.m.
Although I know the folks at eBay are pretty laid back, they do run on mili-
tary time. That means they use a 24-hour clock set to Pacific time. So 3:30 
in the afternoon is 15:30, and one minute after midnight is 00:01. Questions
about time conversions? Check out www.timezoneconverter.com or look
at the table in Chapter 2. And so you don’t have to keep flipping back to that
page, I also include a printable conversion chart of eBay times on my Web
site (www.coolebaytools.com).
Occasionally, eBay conducts a mandatory outage for database maintenance,
which means that it closes up shop on a Friday from 1 a.m. to 3 a.m. Pacific
time (that’s 4 a.m. to 6 a.m. eastern time). Never post an auction right after
this outage. eBay regulars won’t be around to bid on it. Also, search updates
are often 12 to 15 hours behind on Friday and Saturday following scheduled
maintenance.
Going Dutch
If you have five Dennis Rodman Wedding Dolls,
37 Breathalyzers, or 2000 commemorative pins,
and you want to sell them all at once to as many
bidders as quickly as possible, sell them as
multiple quantities in a fixed-price sale. (You
can also sell the whole shebang in one lot in the
Wholesale Lot category.) If you’re not sure how
much you can get for the items, you can always
try a multiple-item (Dutch) auction.
eBay has requirements for starting a Dutch
auction. You have to be an eBay member for at
least 14 days with a feedback rating of 30 or
higher or go through ID Verify. Click the Dutch
auction link on the Sell Your Item page for more
information on how to conduct this type of auc-
tion, and check out Chapter 1 for more info on
how a multiple-item auction works.

With auctions running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, you should know when
the most bidders are around to take a gander at your wares. Here are some
times to think about:
✦Saturday and Sunday: Always run an auction over a weekend. People
log on and off eBay all day to look for desired items.
✦Holiday weekends: If a holiday weekend’s coming up around the time
you’re setting up your auction, run your auction through the weekend
and end it a day after the “holiday” Monday. This gives prospective bid-
ders a chance to catch up with the items they perused over the weekend
and plan their bidding strategies.
Don’t end an auction on the last day of a three-day holiday. People in the
mood to shop are generally at department stores collecting bargains. If
eBay members aren’t shopping, they’re out enjoying an extra day off.
✦Time of day: The best times of day to start and end your auction are
during eBay’s peak hours of operation, which are 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. Pacific
time, right after work on the West Coast. Perform your completed auc-
tion research, however, to be sure that this strategy applies to your
item, because this timing depends on the item you’re auctioning.
Unless you’re an insomniac or a vampire who wants to sell to werewolves,
don’t let your auctions close in the middle of the night. Not enough bidders
are around to cause last-minute bidding that would bump up the price.
Your secret safety net — reserve price
Here’s a little secret: The reason sellers list big-ticket items such as Ferraris,
grand pianos, and high-tech computer equipment with a starting bid of $1 is
because they’re protected from losing money with a reserve price. The reserve
price is the lowest price that must be met before the item can be sold. It is not
required by eBay but can protect you. For this feature, eBay charges an addi-
tional fee that varies depending on how high your reserve is.
For example, say you list a first edition book of John Steinbeck’s The Grapes
of Wrath. You set the starting price at $1 and the reserve price at $80. That
means people can start bidding at $1, and if at the end of the auction the
book hasn’t reached the $80 reserve, you don’t have to sell the book.
As with everything in life, using a reserve price for your auctions has an
upside and a downside. Many choosy bidders and bargain hunters blast past
reserve-price auctions because they see a reserve price as a sign that pro-
claims “No bargains here!” Many bidders figure they can get a better deal on
the same item with an auction that proudly declares NR (for no reserve) in its
description. As an enticement to those bidders, you see lots of NR listings in
auction titles.

If you need to set a reserve on your item, help the bidder out. Many bidders
shy away from an auction that has a reserve, but if they’re really interested,
they will read the item description. To dispel their fears that the item is way
too expensive or out of their price range, add a line in your description that
states the amount of your reserve price. “I have put a reserve of $75 on this
item to protect my investment; the highest bid over $75 will win the item.” 
A phrase such as this takes away the vagueness of the reserve auction and
allows you to place a reserve with a low opening bid. (You want to reel ’em
in, remember?)
On lower-priced items, I suggest that you set a higher minimum bid and set
no reserve.
If bids don’t reach a set reserve price, some sellers e-mail the highest bidder
and offer the item at what the seller thinks is a fair price. Two caveats:
✦eBay can suspend the seller and the buyer if the side deal is reported to
Trust and Safety. This activity is strictly prohibited.
✦eBay won’t protect buyers or sellers if a side deal goes bad.
You can, however, offer an underbidder a second chance offer or relist the
item for another whack at the buying public.
You can’t use a reserve price in a multiple-item (Dutch) auction.
I want to be alone: The private auction
In a private auction, bidders’ user IDs are kept under wraps. Sellers typically
use this option to protect the identities of bidders during auctions for high-
priced big-ticket items (say, that restored World War II fighter). Wealthy eBay
users may not want the world to know that they have the resources to buy
expensive items. Private auctions are also held for items from the Adult/Erotica
category. (Gee, there’s a shocker.)
The famous sign that was pictured in almost every piece of Disney promo-
tion (for the first 40 or so years of Disneyland’s existence) was put up for
sale on eBay in 2000. Rumor has it that the sign was purchased by actor
John Stamos for a high bid of $30,700. Unfortunately for John, the Disney
auctions did not use the private auction feature. After news of the winner’s
name hit the tabloids, the entire world knew John’s eBay user ID! He had to
change his ID in a hurry to end the throngs of lovey-dovey e-mail headed to
his computer!

Put me in the gallery
The gallery is an auction area where you can post pictures that are accessi-
ble from the listings. When you use the gallery, a postage-stamp-size version
of your image appears next to your listing in the category or search. Many
buyers enjoy browsing the gallery catalog-style, and it’s open to all cate-
gories. If you choose to go this route, your item is listed in both the gallery
and in the regular text listings. (I explain how to post your pictures in 
Book V.)
The best thing about using a gallery picture in your listings is that it increases
the space your listing takes up on a search or category page. If you don’t use
a gallery picture and have just an image in your auction, all that will be next
to your listing is a teeny, tiny camera icon.
Filling out the item location
eBay wants you to list the general area and the country in which you live.
That way, you give the bidder a heads-up on what kind of shipping charges
to expect. Don’t be esoteric (listing where you live as The Here and Now isn’t
a whole lot of help), but don’t go crazy with cross-streets, landmarks, or
degrees of latitude. Listing the city and state you live in is enough.
If you live in a big area — say, suburban Los Angeles (who, me?), which
sprawls on for miles — you may want to think about narrowing your region 
a little. You may find a bidder who lives close to you, which could swing
your auction. If you do a face-to-face transaction, choosing a public place 
is a good idea. (I like doing my trades at Starbucks.)
A picture is worth a thousand words
Clichés again? Perhaps. But an item on eBay without a picture is almost a
waste of time. If you haven’t set up photo-hosting elsewhere, you can list 
one picture with eBay’s Pictures Service for free, as shown in Figure 3-6.
Additional pictures will cost you $.15 each.
Avail yourself of eBay’s one free picture; when you do, eBay will give you a
free top-of-the-listing-page picture. I use it and recommend it! Also, you can
put all the additional pictures you want in your auction description for free.
See Book V for the necessary coding and instructions.
Listing Designer
How many times have you seen an item on eBay laid out on the page all
pretty-like with a fancy colorful border around the description? If that sort of
thing appeals to you, eBay’s Listing Designer will supply you with borders for
almost any type of item for $0.10. Will the pretty borders increase the amount
of bids your auction will get? It’s extremely doubtful. A clean item description
with a couple of good, clear pictures of your item are all you need.

Listing the payment methods you’ll accept
Yeah, sure, eBay is loads of fun, but the bottom line to selling is the phrase
“Show me the money!” You make the call on what you’re willing to take as
money from the high bidder of your auction. eBay offers the following pay-
ment options — just select the ones that you like:
✦Money order or cashier’s check: From a seller’s point of view, this is the
safest method of payment. It’s the closest thing you can get to cash. As a
seller, you want to get paid with as little risk as possible. The only draw-
back? You have to wait for the buyer to mail the money.
✦Credit cards: If you accept credit cards, using PayPal is the cheapest
and most convenient way to go. If you have a merchant account through
a retail store, be sure to select the little check boxes next to the credit
cards you accept.
Offering a credit card payment option often attracts higher bids to your
auctions. These higher bids usually more than cover the small percent-
age that credit card payment services charge you to use their services.
Some sellers who use credit card services try attaching an additional 
fee (to cover their credit card processing fees) to the final payment.
However, that’s against the law in California, home of eBay, and there-
fore against eBay’s rules. So forget about it. eBay can end your auction 
if it catches you.
✦COD: I think the COD (cash on delivery) option is the least attractive 
for both buyers and sellers. The buyer has to be home with the cash on
the day that the package arrives. Odds are that on the day the item’s
delivered, your buyer is taking his or her sick pet goldfish to the vet for
Figure 3-6:

clicks!

Filling in Required Blanks
316
a gill-cleaning. Then the item ends up back at your door, and you have
no sale. It also often takes up to 30 days for you to get the money back in
your hands.
✦See item description: I think you should always state in your item
description how you want to be paid. Why? Because there’s no good
reason not to and it takes away the mystery of shopping with you.
✦Personal check: This is an extremely popular option, but it comes with 
a risk. The check could bounce higher than a lob at Wimbledon. If you
accept personal checks, explain in your item description how long you
plan to wait for the check to clear before sending the merchandise. The
average hold is about ten business days. Some sellers wait as long as two
weeks. Accepting eChecks through PayPal leaves all the bookkeeping and
waiting to PayPal; you don’t have to call the bank for confirmation.
Cut down on the risk of bad checks by reading the bidder’s feedback
when the auction is underway. Be wary of accepting checks from people
with negative comments. (I explain all about feedback in Book I.) Never
ship an item until you’re certain the check has cleared the buyer’s bank.
✦Online escrow: An escrow service acts as a referee, a neutral third
party. Escrow companies typically charge 5% of the sale price, and the
buyer usually pays for this service. Unless you’re selling an expensive
item, offering escrow is overkill. On big-ticket items, however, escrow
may make the difference between a sale and a pass. If you do offer
escrow, the winning bidder should inform you right after the auction if
he or she intends to use it.
✦Other: If you’re offering payment options that aren’t listed here, select
this option. Some buyers (mostly international) like to pay in cash, but 
I think this is way too risky and recommend that you never, ever deal in
cash. If a problem arises — for either buyer or seller — no one has evi-
dence that payment was made or received. Avoid it.
Most sellers offer buyers several ways to pay. You can choose as many as
you want. When the auction page appears, your choices are noted at the top
of the listing. Listing several payment options makes you look like a flexible,
easygoing professional.
Setting shipping terms
Ahoy, matey! Hoist the bid! Okay, not quite. Before you run it up the mast,
select your shipping options. Here are your choices:
✦Ship to the United States only: This option is selected by default; it
means you ship only domestically.
✦Will ship worldwide: The world is your oyster. But make sure that you
can afford it.

✦Will ship to United States and the following countries: If you’re com-
fortable shipping to certain countries but not to others, make your
selections here. Your choices appear on your auction page.
When you indicate that you will ship internationally, your auction shows 
up on the international eBay sites, which is a fantastic way to attract new
buyers! eBay has lots of good international users, so you may want to con-
sider selling your items around the world. If you do, be sure to clearly state
in the description all extra shipping costs and customs charges.
Traditionally, the buyer pays for shipping, and this is the point at which you
must decide how much to charge. You also have to calculate how much this
item will cost you to ship. If the item weighs under a pound, you may decide
to charge a flat rate to all buyers. To charge a flat rate, click the Flat Shipping
Rates tab on the Sell Your Item form and fill in the shipping amount. Before
you fill in the amount, be sure to include your charges for packing (see Book
VII for more info on how much to add for this task) and how much the insur-
ance charges will be.
Using eBay’s shipping calculator
When listing an item for sale on eBay, you come to the area where you need
to input your payment and shipping information. You have the option of
using a flat rate, where you simply input your flat shipping charges. The
charges appear in a box at the top and the bottom of your item description.
When your item weighs two pounds or more, you may want to use eBay’s
versatile shipping calculator to determine your flat shipping and handling
cost or to quote a calculated shipping cost. Because UPS and the U.S. Postal
Service now charge variable rates for packages of the same weight, based 
on distance, using the calculator simplifies things for your customers (and
you). Be sure you’ve weighed the item. The calculator allows you to input 
a handling amount and adds it to the overall shipping total — but does not
break out these amounts separately for the customer. The calculator also
conveniently calculates the proper insurance amount for the item. Figure 3-7
shows how simple the calculator is. You may select up to three levels of
shipping per item.
Offering a flat shipping fee for international shipping can be dangerous,
unless you offer shipping to only one foreign country, because the rates to
each country are different. You might prefer to put this information in your
description. (See the Cheat Sheet at the front of the book for instructions on
how to type foreign currency symbols.)

You can check out the associated costs by clicking the Preview rates link.
This link shows you all shipping costs, so you can decide to ship with either
the U.S. Postal Service or UPS. I always test my packages from a California
zip code (because that’s where I live) to a New York zip code. Doing this

4. In the Seller Zip Code box, type your zip code.
5. In the Packaging & Handling Fee box, type your packaging fees.
• When adding your packaging and handling charges, don’t worry that
the buyers will see these individual fees. eBay combines this amount
with the shipping cost and shows the total as one shipping price.
• If you selected the U.S. Postal Service as your carrier, be sure to add
the cost of a delivery confirmation (if you use one) when you figure
your packaging and handling fee.
6. Select the appropriate options in the Shipping Insurance and Sales
Tax drop-down lists.
If you require the buyer to pay for insurance, or even if insurance is
optional, be sure to indicate it. eBay’s calculator will give the buyer the

Checking Your Work and Starting the Auction
After you’ve filled in all the blanks on the Sell Your Item page and you think
you’re ready to join the world of e-commerce, follow these steps:
1. Click the Review button at the bottom of the Sell Your Item page.
You waft to the Verification page, the place where you can catch mistakes
before your item is listed. The Verification page shows you a condensed
version of all your information and tallies how much eBay is charging
you in fees and options to run this auction. You also see a preview of
how your auction description and pictures will look on the site.
You also may find the Verification page helpful as a last-minute chance
to get your bearings. If you’ve chosen a general category, eBay asks you
whether you’re certain there isn’t a more appropriate category. You can
go back to any of the pages that need correcting by clicking the appro-
priate tab at the top of the Verification page. Make category changes or
any other changes and additions, and then head for the Verification page
again.
2. Check for mistakes.
Nitpick for common, careless errors; you won’t be sorry. I’ve seen eBay
members make goofs such as the wrong category listing, spelling and
grammatical errors, and missing information about shipping, handling,
insurance, and payment methods.
3. When you’re sure everything is accurate and you’re happy with your
item listing, click the Submit My Listing button.

An Auction Confirmation page pops up. At that precise moment, your
auction begins, even though it may be a couple of hours before it
appears in eBay’s search and listings updates. If you want to see your
auction right away and check for bids, your Auction Confirmation page
provides a link for that purpose. Click the link, and you’re there. You 
can also keep track of your auctions by using the My eBay page.
All auction pages come with this friendly warning: Seller assumes all respon-
sibility for listing this item.
Some eBay veterans just gloss over this warning after they’ve been wheeling
and dealing for a while, but it’s an important rule to remember. Whether
you’re buying or selling, you’re always responsible for your actions.
For the first 24 hours after your auction is underway, eBay stamps the
Auction Item page with a funky sunrise icon next to the listing in the cate-
gory listing page or search results page. This is just a little reminder for
buyers to come take a look at the latest items up for sale.
Making Midcourse Corrections
If you made a mistake filling out the Sell Your Item page but didn’t notice it
until after the auction is up and running, don’t worry. Pencils have erasers,
and eBay allows revisions. You can make changes at two stages of the game:
before the first bid is placed and after the bidding war is underway. This sec-
tion explains what you can (and can’t) correct — and when you have to
accept the little imperfections of your Auction Item page.
Making changes before bidding begins
Here’s what you can change about your auction before bids have been
placed, as long as your auction does not end within 12 hours:
✦The title, subtitle, or description
✦The item category
✦The item’s Minimum Bid price
✦The item’s Buy It Now price (or adding a Buy It Now price)
✦The reserve price (you can add, change, or remove it)
✦The duration of your listing
✦The URL of the picture you’re including with your auction
✦A private auction designation (you can add or remove it)
✦Accepted payment methods, the item location, and shipping terms

When you revise an auction, eBay puts a little notation on your auction page
that reads: Description (revised).
To revise an auction before bids have been received, follow these steps:
1. Go to the auction page and click the Revise Your Item link.
This link will appear only if you’ve signed in on eBay. If the item hasn’t
received any bids, a message appears on your screen to indicate that
you may update the item.
You’re taken to the Revise Your Item page, which outlines the rules for
revising your item. At the bottom, the item number is filled in.
2. Click Revise Item.
You arrive at the Revise Your Item page which looks suspiciously like the
Sell Your Item form.
3. Click the link that corresponds to the area you’d like to change.
4. Make changes to the item information.
5. When you’ve finished making changes, click the Save Changes button
at the bottom of the page.
A summary of your newly revised auction page appears on your screen.
If you’ve incurred any additional fees, the amount is listed at the bottom
of the page. If you want to make more changes, click the Back button of
your browser and redo the Update Your Information page.
6. When you’re happy with your revisions, click Submit Revisions.
You’re taken to your newly revised auction item page, where you see a
disclaimer from eBay that says you’ve revised the auction before the
first bid.
Making changes after bidding begins
If your auction is up and running and already receiving bids, you can still
make some slight modifications to it. Newly added information is clearly 
separated from the original text and pictures. In addition, eBay puts a time
stamp on the additional info in case questions from early bidders crop up
later.
After your item receives bids, eBay allows you to add to your item’s descrip-
tion. If you feel you were at a loss for words in writing your item’s description
or if a lot of potential bidders are asking the same questions, go ahead and
make all the additions you want. But whatever you put there the first time
around stays in the description as well.

Making Midcourse Corrections

Follow the same procedure for making changes before bidding begins. When
you arrive at the Revise Your Item page, you can only add to your descrip-

will not be changed — only appended.
Alternatively, click Services on the navigation bar at the top of the page,
scroll down to the Manage Your Active Listings; Add to item description link.
If you use this route, make sure you write down the item number because
you must enter it before making any changes.
Don’t let an oversight grow into a failure to communicate and don’t ignore
iffy communication until the auction is over. Correct any inaccuracies in
your auction information now to avoid problems later on.
Always check your e-mail (or your My eBay page) to see whether bidders
have questions about your item. If a bidder wants to know about flaws, be
truthful and courteous when returning e-mails. As you get more familiar with
eBay (and with writing auction descriptions), the number of e-mail questions
will decrease. If you enjoy good customer service in your day-to-day shop-
ping, here’s your chance to give some back.

Turbo Lister
In This Chapter
 Knowing the requirements
 Downloading the software
 Preparing your listing
N
ot much in this world is free, but for now, eBay offers you a free, con-
venient tool you can use to list your items for sale: Turbo Lister. This
powerful software helps you organize your items for sale, design your ads,
and list them. It organizes your items for future relisting as well by saving
your initial item input and allowing you to create folders for storage. Your
items disappear from the program only if you delete them.
I like Turbo Lister because it’s simple and easy to use, with a built-in WYSIWYG
(what you see is what you get) HTML editor that makes preparing your eBay
listings offline a breeze. After you’ve input your items and are ready to list,
you can just click a button and they’re all listed at once. You can also stagger
listings and schedule them for a later date for a fee. In this chapter, you get
an inside look at how Turbo Lister works.
Although Turbo Lister is free, you’re still responsible for any fees you incur
by listing an item on the site.
Features and Minimum Requirements
Turbo Lister is robust software with the following features:
✦Self-updates: Turbo Lister automatically updates itself regularly from
the eBay site and includes any new eBay enhancements so your listings
always take advantage of eBay’s latest features. Whenever you invoke
the program, it loads and then immediately checks with the eBay server
for updates. This can be a bit laborious (especially if the servers are
busy or you have a slow Internet connection), so if you plan on listing
items at a particular time, be sure to open Turbo Lister earlier, giving it
a few minutes to work its updating magic.

Features and Minimum Requirements
326
✦HTML templates: Predesigned HTML templates are built into the pro-
gram’s Listing Designer. If you use one of eBay’s multitude of colorful
themes or layouts, you will be charged an additional $.10 on top of your
listing fees. You can use a template of your own design to jump-start
your ad design without incurring extra charges by pasting the template
into the HTML view. You can even use templates from other sources
(such as those in Book V), as long as they are in HTML format.
✦WYSIWYG interface: If you choose to design your own ads from scratch,
you can do it with Turbo Lister’s easy-to-use WYSIWYG (what you see is
what you get) layout design.
✦Bulk listing tool: Prepare your listings whenever you have the time.
When you’re ready to launch a group of them, just transfer them to the
upload area, and, well, upload them.
✦Item preview: You can preview your listings to be sure they look just as
you want them to.
✦All item listing capabilities are available offline: By using Turbo Lister
(and its constant auto-upgrading), you don’t sacrifice any of the features
available to you when you list on the site using the Sell Your Item form.
Although this software is definitely useful, you have to decide whether it’s
really for you. The first thing to check is whether your computer meets
Turbo Lister’s minimum requirements.
✦Your computer must be a PC, not a Mac (sorry, Mac users). You have to
have the Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000, or XP operating system.
✦The processor must be at least a Pentium II. The faster your processor,
the better.
✦You must have at least 64MB RAM (and that’s a bare minimum).
The more RAM you have, the better things work.
✦You should have at least 30MB of free space on your hard drive to run
the installation.
✦A monitor setting of at least 800 x 600 resolution, 256 colors (8-bit). Keep
in mind the software interface looks a lot better with 16-bit color and
1024 x 768 resolution. All monitors today have this capability, so you
should be just fine here.
✦Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.01 or later.
To check your version of Internet Explorer with the browser open, click the
Help menu and then choose About Internet Explorer. On the top line, your
Internet Explorer version number is listed.

Downloading and Starting Turbo Lister
To use Turbo Lister, you must first download it at
pages.ebay.com/turbo_lister/download.html
After you install Turbo Lister on your computer, you can list auctions on the
easy-to-use form. What could be simpler?
You can find the Turbo Lister software in several ways:
✦Click the Services tab above the navigation bar. On the resulting
Services page, scroll to Listing Solutions, and then find Seller Tools.
✦From your My eBay page, click the All Selling link. Then, in the Related
Links box, click Seller Tools.
✦If all else fails, do what I do. Go the eBay site map from the link above
the navigation bar. (Most everything on eBay is on the site map.) Scroll
down to Selling Tools, and then click Turbo Lister.
After you get to the Seller Tools page, download Turbo Lister. Follow these
steps:
1. Click the Download Now link.
The requirements for using Turbo Lister appear above the two links for
downloading.
2. Click the Turbo Lister Web Setup link.
The Windows Security warning appears, cautioning that you’re about to
download something foreign to your computer.
3. Click Yes.
Clicking Yes downloads Turbo Lister. Clicking No doesn’t. Just trust me
(and eBay ) and click Yes.
From this point on, installation is automatic. Voilà! Turbo Lister is on your
computer!
Note that this procedure first downloads a small setup version of the pro-
gram that checks your computer for preinstalled files. When that task is 
finished, Turbo Lister checks back with mothership eBay and automatically
downloads any files it needs.
After you’ve installed the program, you’ll see a new icon on your desktop; a
little green man juggling magic pixie dust over his head. This is the icon for
Turbo Lister. Double-click it and you’ll see the Turbo Lister splash screen.
This will pop up every time you open the program, which can get annoying.

Preparing an eBay Listing
328
It doesn’t do anything for you and wastes precious seconds of your time. 
If you want to avoid it, select the check box labeled Do not show me this
screen again, and then click Start Here. The little green man will be forever
banished.
When the program is open, the first thing you do is to set up a new Turbo
Lister file:
1. Select the Start option from the opening screen, and click Next.
2. Fill in your eBay user ID and password, and then click Next.
Turbo Lister now wants to connect back to eBay to retrieve your eBay
account information.
3. Make sure your Internet connection is live, and then click the Connect
Now button.
In a minute or so, a small window opens with your eBay registration
information (your name, address, and e-mail address).
4. Indicate your geographic region.
The last text block on the page allows you to select the option of listing
locally. Click the down arrow in its corner and see whether there’s an
eBay region within your metropolitan area. If so, select it and your item
will also be searchable within your region of the United States.
5. Click Finish.
The program fires up and is ready to list.
Preparing an eBay Listing
Now that you have Turbo Lister at hand, you can prepare hundreds of eBay
listings in advance and launch them with a single mouse click. Or, if you
want to start your auctions at a particular date and time, you can select a
scheduled item launching format. (More on that later.)
Follow these steps to list an auction:
1. Click the Create New button (the one with the magic-wand symbol) in
the upper-left corner.
The screen shown in Figure 4-1 appears. This is where you decide the
type of listing you want. Most of the information requested is identical
to the eBay Sell Your Item form.
2. Select the Auction option, and then click Next.
A page appears, ready for you to enter your title and subtitle if you want.

You can save bunches of time if you write your titles and descriptions in
Notepad or Word, at your leisure, before you go into Turbo Lister. You
can use your own templates or use the Design View to doll up your text.
3. In the Item Title box, enter the title.
If you want to use a subtitle, type that as well. Subtitles are handy for
adding selling points that accompany your title in search results.
(Entering a subtitle for your auction costs an additional $.50.)
4. Select your category by clicking the Find Category box.
You are presented with a screen that lists all eBay categories in a hierar-
chal format. The main categories are listed with a plus sign next to them.
When you find your main category, click the plus sign, and subcate-
gories are displayed, as shown in Figure 4-2. To drop even lower into the
world of nether-categories, keep clicking plus signs next to subtopics.
You know you’ve hit the bottom rung of the category ladder when you
see only a minus sign.
5. If you have an eBay store, select a category for the item in your store
from the drop-down list shown in Figure 4-3.
This area is automatically populated from your eBay store when eBay
updates your Turbo Lister installation.

Designing your listing
When it comes to designing your listing, you have several options. eBay
makes it a snap to design your item listing with a few easy features:
✦Templates and themes: I’m sure you’ve seen eBay listings with nice
graphics in the borders. These come from eBay’s easy-to-use theme tem-
plates, which are listed on the left side of the screen. You may select 
any of these colorful templates to doll up your listing. Themes make the
listing look pretty, but they may draw attention away from the selling
strength of your pictures. Remember that your good description and a
quality photo will sell your item. Also keep in mind that eBay charges an
additional $.10 to use these themes in your listing. You don’t have to use
any of the themes; just be sure not to select the box next to Use Designer.
✦Layout: These options are available only if you are going to pay for using
Designer. You may select from Standard, Photos Left, Photos Right, One
Photo Top, Photos Bottom, or Slide Show.
When you use eBay Picture Services, the first picture is free. By using
your first free picture, you can have a great-looking header picture at 
the top of your listing page. Additional pictures are $.15 and a slide show
will cost you the princely sum of $.75.
✦WYSIWYG HTML design form: You can base your ad on this very 
easy-to-use design form. It has a toolbar similar to the formatting tool-
bar in Microsoft Word (see Figure 4-4), so the buttons should be familiar.
There’s even a command to insert a Web link into your description (see
Figure 4-5), so you can have the prospective buyer e-mail you with a
click of the mouse.
Figure 4-4:
The HTML
design
toolbar.
Importing your existing eBay listings
If you have multiple stock items listed on eBay
(that you’ve listed through the Sell Your Item
page or with eBay’s relist feature), you can
import those listings into Turbo Lister for future
use and relisting. Just choose File➪Import
Items➪From eBay Listings. In a moment or two,
you’re presented with a complete tally of every-
thing you have listed for sale on the site. You
may then select all or just a few to import into
Turbo Lister. You can then save your listings as
templates or for uploading at a later date.

Preparing an eBay Listing
332
✦HTML view: If you have a smattering of HTML knowledge, you may want
to edit your listing design in HTML view. You can also insert your hosted
images by entering supplementary coding into the HTML view. (See Book
V for additional information about coding and inserting your pictures 
in the description area.) Also, if you have your own predesigned tem-
plate, you can copy and paste the HTML for the template into the HTML
view box.
At any time during the design process, click the Preview button to see what
your listing looks like in an Internet browser.
Be sure to add at least one additional picture using eBay’s Picture Services so
that you can use the free header picture. Just click one of the boxes labeled
Click Here to Insert Picture, and select any picture on your computer’s hard
drive. When your picture appears in the Turbo Lister box, click Next.
On the Step 3 page is a Save as Template button. Suppose you’ve finally
designed a simple template that you’d like to use over and over for your 
auctions. (I have two pet templates — one with a vertical picture and one with
a horizontal picture. They may be simple, but I use them again and again.) You
can save any listing you’ve created as a template and then merely substitute
the new text the next time you want to use that template format.

Getting down to specifics
Now it’s time to get all the little details into your listing, such as the number
of days to run the listing and your shipping and payment information. You
do all this on the Format Specifics page, as shown in Figure 4-6.
eBay fills in much of this information for you. To edit the information per-
taining to an option, such as Payment Methods or Item Location, click the
Change button in the appropriate area. Clicking the Change button displays
a small menu for adding text or changing defaults. After you’ve made your
changes, click OK.
Save time by saving repetitive text as the default. For example, when you
want all your listings to have the same information in Payment Instructions
or Payment Methods, select the Save for Future Listings check box in the
detail area that appears when you click Change. This saves the information
as the default. You can always change the information on a case-by-case
basis when listing another item.
After you’ve filled out all the information in the Format Specifics areas,
click Save.

Organizing your listings
After you’ve put together a few listings, your Turbo Lister Item Inventory will
look something like Figure 4-7. Just click the tab to get there. Note that you
can add folders to the folder list to save inventories for different categories
of items.
To create a folder and move items into it, follow these steps:
1. Open the Turbo Lister program.
2. Near the top of the screen, click the Create New button and select the
command to create a new folder.
3. Give your new folder a name, and then click OK.
The folder appears in the folder list on the left side of the screen.
4. To move a listing to a different folder, highlight the listing and drag it
to the folder.
To move multiple listings at once, press the Control key or the Shift key
and then click the listings.
You can look at all your items, including those in folders, by clicking Item
Inventory. To see the contents of a particular folder, just click the folder
name.

Uploading items to eBay
After you’ve input a few listings, you may want to upload them so they will
become active on eBay. Turbo Lister makes it easy to upload items from
your Items Inventory on your computer to eBay.
1. Highlight the listing you want to upload.
2. If you want to schedule the listing to upload at a later date or time,
select the Schedule to Start On option (at the bottom of the screen)
and choose a date and time.
You’re charged an additional $.10 fee for any item you choose to sched-
ule for a Scheduled listing.
3. Click the Add to Upload button, which is in the lower-right corner.
Your listing is copied to the Listings Waiting to Upload tab, as shown in
Figure 4-8.
4. Repeat Step 1 to upload additional listings.
You can define the order in which your listings upload to eBay by high-
lighting the item you want to move on the Listings Waiting to Upload
page and then clicking the up or down arrow.

5. To send items to eBay to be listed immediately, click Upload All to
eBay.
eBay calculates your fees before posting the listings; you can approve or
cancel the upload before the listing goes live on the site.
6. Approve the upload and your items will be live on the site!

F
or the beginning seller, the My eBay page will ease your way into selling
by giving you complete control of your auctions. When you start run-
ning more listings than you can handle on My eBay comfortably, you may
want to consider upgrading your My eBay page to Selling Manager.
This chapter explains how you can get the most out of the My eBay: All
Selling page, and how it can benefit your business.
Managing Your All Selling Area
eBay provides some smooth management tools on your All Selling page. You
can track items you currently have up for auction and items you’ve sold.
The All Selling page is a quick way to get a snapshot of the dollar value of
your auctions as they proceed. Although this page isn’t as good for market-
ing information (detailed counters are best — see Book VIII), it is a pretty
good way to tell at a glance how your items are faring.
The All Selling home page, which is shown in Figure 5-1, has several areas:
✦Selling Reminders: In the middle of the page, these give you a clear idea
of what is going on with your eBay sales.
✦Scheduled Items: If you’ve scheduled auctions to begin later, they’re
listed here.
✦Selling Totals: A tote board that gives you an idea of your sales during
the past 31 days.

Managing Your All Selling Area
338
If you continue to scroll waaaay down the page, you’ll see far too much infor-
mation. To avoid all that scrolling, click the links on the left side of the page
to go to each individual area on its own page.
eBay’s All Selling area allows you to customize various pages. Also, hidden
features allow you to perform “paperwork” tasks. These features are avail-
able in different areas, so before I tell you what each page can do, you
should be familiar with the pages.
My eBay: Items I’m Selling page
With the Items I’m Selling page, shown in Figure 5-2, you can keep an eye on
your store items, your fixed-price sales, and the progress of your auctions.
You can see how many bids your auctions have, whether your reserves have
been met, and how much time remains before the auction closes. By clicking
an auction title, you can visit the auction to make sure your pictures are
appearing or to check your counter.
Don’t be frustrated if you don’t have a ton of bids. Many people watch auc-
tions and don’t bid until the last minute, so you may not see a lot of bidding
activity on your page. Be sure to customize your page and select the # of
Watchers option so you can get a grip on how many people are interested in
your item. Click the Customize link in the upper right to set your options.

At the top of the Items I’m Selling area, eBay lists all items currently up for
sale. The total dollar amount of the items that have been bid on appears
with these totals. On the right side of your listings, eBay has a column for
icons.
You can perform several actions on the Items I’m Selling page:
✦Sort: You can view Currently Selling items, Currently Not Selling items,
or All items by clicking the appropriate Show link. If you’re running
many items for sale, sorting your items gives you a shorter page to
view. The default is All, which shows all your listings on one page.
✦Add note: If you want to add a notation (which only you can see and
only on this page), select the check box to the left of the item and then
click the Add Note button at the top of the listings. Just type your com-
ment on the page that appears and click Save.
✦Print: Click the Print link (near the top of the page) and a new window
appears so that you can print, from your browser, your full list of items
for sale.
✦Customize: Click this link (it’s next to the Print link) to display the
screen shown in Figure 5-3. From here, you can customize the way your
listings appear on the page:
• Add available columns to the Columns to Display list: Select details
that you’d like to see on the page by highlighting them and clicking
the arrows to move data back and forth.

• Display: You can select whether or not you want the item title, notes,
and cross-promotion status to appear alongside the item.
• Items per page: Select the number of items to view per page.
Make sure you pay attention to the drop-down list that appears at the end of
each listing (refer to Figure 5-2). This menu has powerful menu options that
allow you to do the following:
✦Sell Similar: List an item similar to the one on your page.
✦Revise: Change a listing that has no bids.
✦Add to Description: Add text to your listing’s description after the listing
has bids.
✦End Item: When the dog plays tug-of-war with your item, you can end
the listing.
✦Edit Promotions: You may choose your cross-promotion items to pro-
mote here.
Auctions that appear in green have received one or more bids (and met 
any reserves you’ve set). Auctions in red haven’t received any bids or the
reserve price hasn’t been met. Dutch auctions aren’t color-coded and appear
in black.
My eBay: Items I’ve Sold page
As you scroll down the All Selling page (refer to Figure 5-1), you’ll come to
the Items I’ve Sold area. To avoid a lot of scrolling, you can reach this area
by clicking the Sold link under All Selling in the Me eBay Views box (on the
left side of the page).

The Items I’ve Sold area keeps your sales in a concise place, as shown in
Figure 5-4. I use it in lieu of fancy auction management software. If you’re
selling hundreds of items, your list will probably be too long to monitor indi-
vidual auctions — but you can view the total current price of the items that
will sell.
The Items I’ve Sold page has the following features, which I’m sure you’ll find
helpful in completing your transactions:
✦Check box: Select a check box to perform a task on one or more of the
items, such as remove from the list, add a note, or print a shipping label.
✦Buyer’s user ID and feedback rating: The eBay ID of the winner of the
sale. Click it to go to the user’s Member Profile, where you can use
eBay’s e-mail sever to contact the buyer. (You can also customize this
area to display the buyer’s e-mail address instead of his or her user ID
for identification.)
✦Quantity: If the sale was for multiple items, the number of items is dis-
played here.
✦Item title: A direct link to the auction. You can click this link to check on
your auction and see the other bidders, should you want to make a
second chance offer.
✦Item number: The auction number for your records.

✦Sale price: The final selling price for your item.
✦Total price: The final selling price plus the shipping amount.
✦Sale date: Keep an eye on the end date so that you can be sure you get
your payment as agreed.
✦Action: Here’s where you find a hidden, drop-down list that works
with the icons to the right and offers links to various actions that you
can take:
• Mark as paid: If the customer hasn’t paid using PayPal, you can indi-
cate the method of payment (after you receive it).
• View payment status: See a copy of the payment receipt if the buyer
paid using PayPal or see a notation you inserted regarding other pay-
ment methods.
• Print shipping label: You can print a shipping label from here. See
Book VII for more professional options.
• Leave feedback: Leave feedback with a single click once you’ve
heard that the item arrived safely and your customer is happy.
• Mark shipped: After you’ve shipped the item, click here to indicate
that it’s on the way.
• Second chance offer: Click here to make a second chance offer to
one of your underbidders if you have multiple items for sale.
• Sell similar: When you want to list a similar item (or relist a sold
one) you can do it quickly here.
• Relist: Here you can relist your item on the site.
Not all the action links appear on every item; they appear based on
the progress of the item in the sales process.
✦Icons: My eBay has several icons that appear dimmed until you perform
an action with the Action command. You may also click the icons at the
top of the list to sort your listings by auctions completed, although most
sellers prefer to keep the listings in the default chronological order.
• Shopping cart: The buyer has completed checkout (supplying a
shipping address and a planned payment method).
• Dollar sign: The buyer has paid using PayPal, or you’ve noted that
the buyer has paid with a different form of payment (such as a
money order or a personal check) on the drop-down list within the
sale record.
• Shipping box: You’ve indicated that the item has shipped.
• Star: You’ve left feedback for the buyer.
• Comment bubble: The buyer has left you feedback. A plus sign (+)
indicates a positive comment, and a minus sign (-) indicates a nega-
tive comment.

My eBay: Unsold Items page
The Unsold Items page indicates the items that didn’t sell. To get to that
area, you can scroll way down the page or click the Unsold link under All
Selling in the Me eBay Views box (on the left side of the page).
The drop-down list beside each item allows you to relist (so that you can get
a listing credit for the first run of the item if it sells the second time) or sell
similar (if the item hasn’t sold after two listings, start the cycle in eBay’s
computer fresh as new).
When an item is relisted, a check mark appears next to the Relist link and
the circular arrow goes from dimmed to solid.
Notifying Winners and Sending Invoices
Thank goodness, somebody submitted a winning bid on one of your items 
in an auction. It’s a good feeling. When I get those end-of-transaction e-mails
from eBay, I whisper a silent yeah! Then I hold my breath to see whether the
buyer will go directly to PayPal and make the payment. Usually, that’s what
happens. More and more buyers are getting savvy and understand about
paying immediately after winning an item.
New buyers and those who buy or win multiple items from you (my favorite
kind of buyer!) usually wait to hear from you regarding payment and ship-
ping. Many newbies feel more comfortable hearing from you and knowing
who they’re doing business with. Also, in the case of multiple purchases, 
you have to recalculate the postage. The sooner you contact the buyer, the
sooner you’ll get your payment.
Notifying winners
eBay sends out an end-of-transaction e-mail to both the buyer and the seller.
The e-mail is informative to the seller and a welcome e-mail for the buyer.
Figure 5-5 shows you a typical, “yippee, you won” e-mail. It’s brightly colored
and joyful, probably designed to evoke some strong level of excitement in
the buyer.
Both e-mails have similar information; the e-mail to the buyer has a Pay Now
button, as shown in the figure. The seller’s e-mail has a link to create an
invoice to send the buyer. Either of these linked forms include:
✦Item title and number.
✦The final bid or Buy It Now price.
✦Quantity.
✦Seller or buyer’s user ID and e-mail address.

Notifying Winners and Sending Invoices
344
✦Ship-to zip code.
✦A link to update your zip code.
✦A link for viewing the item. This link is good for up to 90 days. Note that
this is the only place you get this link, and unless you subscribe to
eBay’s Selling Manager, you’d better keep hold of it. Sold items remain
on your My eBay page for 60 days, but the items disappear from the
eBay search engine within 2 weeks.
✦A buyer’s link to complete checkout to let the seller know how the buyer
intends to pay.
✦Links to e-Bay help and feedback.
That’s a lot of information, and I’ll bet the average user just glances over it
and either deletes it (bad idea) or files it in a special folder in his or her
e-mail program.
If you think eBay’s notification is good enough, it’s time to rethink your cus-
tomer service policy. An e-mail to the buyer at this point is important.
Customer contact is key to a good transaction.
If the buyer sprints directly to PayPal and sends you some money to pay
for a purchase, a special e-mail from you is required. Thank them for their
payment and let them know when the item will ship, as detailed in the next
section, “Thanking them kindly.”

Lucky you!
You’re a

Thanking them kindly
Now’s the time to let the customer know just how darned tickled you are
that this person spent hard-earned money with you. Your thank-you e-mail 
is a quasi invoice and informational note. What should go in it? Well, try to
keep in mind what your mother said; always say please and thank you. After
thanking the buyer for purchasing your goods, be sure to cover the following
points (this is where the “please” part comes in):
✦Item name: You don’t want the buyer to forget what was purchased.
✦Payment terms: Let the buyer know what forms of payment you accept
and how long you intend to wait for your money.
✦Payment address: Be sure to tell the buyer where you want the money
sent.
✦PayPal button: Inserting a PayPal button in your e-mail is a snap and may
pay off in some rapid payments; see Book II, Chapter 4 for instructions.
✦Return policy: Will you accept returns? Under what circumstances? It’s
okay if you don’t accept returns, but be sure that you had that informa-
tion in your item description before the purchase was made.
✦Reminder to print the e-mail and enclose it with payment: Veteran
eBay sellers can tell you stories about the money order that arrived with
no item number, no return address, no e-mail address — basically no
clue as to what the payment was for.
✦Store pitch: If you have an eBay store, mention it here. If not, just be
sure to tell buyers that you’re happy to have them as customers and you
look forward to serving them again.
✦Feedback pitch: Most PowerSellers that I know include a small pitch at
the closing of the e-mail for leaving feedback about you on eBay. Remind
the customers to e-mail you immediately if there’s a problem when the
order arrives. Stress how you want them to be happy with their pur-
chases. That may stave off a knee-jerk negative that beginners tend to
leave when an item arrives cracked. (They shoulda bought insurance —
it helps to require it on fragile items.)
That ought to do it. Including this information will make your newbie buyer
or old-time veteran feel at home doing business with you.
Thanks for the money!
Sometimes you have to beg for payment. On the other hand, when some
blessed buyer pays immediately through PayPal, it’s time to show your grati-
tude by sending a “thanks for the money” e-mail. The e-mail can be short and
sweet and to the point. Be sure to
✦Thank the customer for the purchase and swift payment.

Tracking Payments in All Selling
You’ve created a winning ad, run a successful auction or sale, notified the
winner, and sent off an invoice. Now it’s time for the big payoff: getting the
money in hand for your item. eBay and PayPal work in concert to offer sev-
eral tools to notify you when a payment is made.
Once again, the Items I’ve Sold area of My eBay comes to the rescue. As if by
magic, every time one of your buyers makes a payment through the PayPal
service, your My eBay page indicates that the item has been paid by chang-
ing the dollar sign icon from dimmed to solid. Take a look back at Figure 5-4,
and note the items that have been paid using PayPal.
PayPal also sends you a payment received e-mail — but I have a few caveats
about using this form of notification.
If you do not receive any form of notification of a payment received from a
buyer, check your PayPal account before going through the trouble of send-
ing a nonpaying bidder notice. A new eBay buyer may have misspelled your
e-mail address or applied the payment to an incorrect item number. If this is
the case, you’ll have to e-mail the buyer and ask the person to cancel any
payment made and pay for the item with the correct item number and your
correct e-mail address.
To confirm the information about a payment shown in the Items I’ve Sold
area of My eBay, follow these steps:
1. Click the drop-down list next to the item’s listing, and select the View
Payment Status option.
The Seller’s Payment Status page appears, as shown in Figure 5-6.
2. For further information, click the View PayPal payment link, at the
top of the page.
3. Sign into PayPal with your password and click Continue.
The PayPal Web site payment details screen appears, giving you com-
plete information on the purchase.
After you’ve finished viewing this page, you may click the Return to Log
button at the bottom of the page to go to your account history page. From
here, you can transfer the money to your bank account.

Relisting Items without Extra Work
One of the most efficient ways to run an eBay business is to stock the same
item in quantity. After getting some eBay experience under your belt, you’re
bound to find several items that you’re comfortable selling. And, if you follow
my suggestions in Book IV, you’ll buy multiples (dozens? cases? pallets?) of
the items at a seriously discounted price. When you have all these items lying
around the garage, your goal is to get them into buyers’ hands at a profit.
In Book VIII, I talk about opening an eBay store. But in addition to your own
store, you must be running auctions on the eBay site. Why? Auctions are the
key to drawing buyers into your store. Stores are not only added potential
sales but a distinct marketing tool for your personal eBay brand.
I know several sellers who bought items in such bulk that they’re stocked
with the item to sell once a week for the next few years! That’s a good thing
only if the product is a staple item that will always have a market on eBay.

Relisting after a win
Yeah! Your space-age can opener with a built-in DVD player sold! Since you
have three dozen more to sell, the quicker you can get that item back up on
the site, the sooner you’ll connect with the next customer.
When bidders lose an auction on eBay, one of the first things they do is
search for somebody offering the same item. The sooner you get an item
relisted, the sooner a disappointed underbidder will find your listing. Of
course, relisting the item also makes it available to other interested bidders
who may not have bid on the item before.
When you offer an item for bidding and it reaches well beyond your target
price, why not offer another one with a Buy It Now option? True, this may
slow (or possibly end) further bidding on the first item, but if you’ve
exceeded your target price and folks are hot for your item, sell it to them
now! That kind of initiative is what eBay is all about.
If at first you don’t succeed
Boo! Your Dansk Maribo dinner plate didn’t sell. Don’t take it personally. It’s
not that someone out there doesn’t love you. It doesn’t mean that your mer-
chandise is trash. It’s just that this particular week no one was looking for
Maribo plates (go figure).
Often eBay shoppers shop with no discernable pattern. No one may want
your item at a certain price one week, and then you may sell five or six the
next week. It happens to me all the time.
When relisting, you often need to make adjustments. Perhaps the keywords
in your title aren’t drawing people to your listing. To help you figure out
whether the problem is you or the market, search for other, similar items to
see whether anyone is buying. If there’s just no bidding activity (perhaps
you’re selling bikinis in January?), perhaps that item needs to be retired from
eBay for a while.
Consider some other variables. Are other items selling on the site with a
lower starting price? If you can comfortably lower your price, do so. If not,
wait until other sellers run out of the item. Then put yours up for auction —
you may just get more bidding action if you’re one of the few sellers offering
the same item.
I have quite a few items that I purchased by the case — right along with a
bunch of other eBay sellers. They desperately dumped theirs on the site,
without paying any attention to the competition. I waited and got my target
price for the item the following season.

eBay is a supply and demand marketplace. If the supply exceeds the demand,
prices go down. If you have an item that sells as fast as you can list it, prices
go up.
Okay, time to relist (or Sell Similar)
eBay gives you many ways to relist an item. Because this chapter features
My eBay, I’ll cover that method here. When you upgrade to Selling Manager,
the procedure is a bit different; visit Book VIII, Chapter 1 for details.
Figure 5-7 shows the seller’s version of a sold item (only the seller sees this
when he or she is signed in), which includes Relist and Sell Similar links.
Rather than go to each item’s page to relist, however, get off the auction
page and go to your My eBay page. The relisting process will be much faster.
The Relist link is best used for unsold items, so you might benefit from a list-
ing fee refund if your item sells a second time. The Sell Similar link is best for
sold items because it starts a new item cycle with eBay — if the item doesn’t
sell, you have the ability to relist it for the unsold item refund.
To sell a similar item, from the Items I’ve Sold page on My eBay, click the
drop-down list next to the listing and select the Sell Similar option. Now the
review step of the Sell Your Item form appears. You can make any changes
you want — or not!
You can go to the All Selling: Unsold Items page of My eBay to relist unsold
items (for a possible listing fee credit) in the same fashion. See Figure 5-8.

Most eBay users don’t know the extent of eBay’s seller-specific services. And
sometimes sellers are so involved with their auctions that they don’t take
the time to find out about new helper tools. So I’ve gone deep into the eBay
pond to dig up a few excellent tools to help you with your online business.
Even if you’ve used some of these before, it might be time to revisit them
because eBay has implemented quite a few changes during the past year.
Canceling bids
Did you know that you don’t have to accept bids from just anyone? Although
many people include notices in their auction descriptions attempting to
qualify bidders ahead of time, this doesn’t always prevent them from bidding
on your auction. Alas, part of the business is watching your bidders. With
bidder-management tools, you can save yourself a good deal of grief.
You could have any number of reasons for wanting to cancel someone’s bid.
Here are a few more legitimate reasons for canceling a bid:
✦The bidder contacts you to back out of the bid; choosing to be a nice
guy, you let him or her out of the deal.
✦Your bidder has several negative feedbacks and hasn’t gone through
with other transactions that he or she has won.
✦You’re unable to verify the bidder’s identity through e-mail or the phone.
✦You need to cancel the auction.

Book III
Chapter 5
Managing Your
Sales on  My eBay 
eBay Bidder-Management Tools
351
When you plan to cancel someone’s bid, you should first e-mail that person
and clearly explain why you’re doing so. Your bid cancelation appears in the
auction’s bidding history and becomes part of the auction’s official record.
For that reason, I recommend that you leave a concise, unemotional, one-line
explanation on the cancelation form as to why you’ve canceled the bid.
To get to the bid cancelation form, start on your My eBay, All Selling, Items
I’m Selling page. In the Related Links box (on the left), click the More link.
You’ll now be able to access the bid cancelation form. You can get to the 
cancelation form directly by typing the following in your browser:
http://pages.ebay.com/services/buyandsell/seller-cancel-bid.html
Ending your listing early
You may decide to end a listing early for any number of reasons. If any 
bids are on your auction before ending it, you are duty-bound to sell to 
eBay preferences settings
Many eBay sellers bemoan the fact that inter-
national buyers bid on their items, when the
items clearly state that they do not ship inter-
nationally. Also, they get upset when a bidder
with a minus level feedback wins an item.
Quit whining and do something about it! On 
your My eBay➪My Account➪eBay Preferences
page, you can set defaults that will affect your
bidders. On this page, scroll to Seller Preferences:
Buyer Block Preferences.
Click the link to change your preferences. On
the Buyer Block Preferences page (see the
figure), you may indicate who you do not want
to be permitted to bid on your items. If any of
your bidders fall into that category and attempt
to bid, they will see a notice saying they are
unable to bid.
In the case of international buyers, I have found
that they e-mail me to ask me to ship to them. I
check their feedback, and if it’s clear to me that
they know the ropes, I can put their user ID on
my Blocked Bidder Exception list and they’re
free to win my item.

the highest bidder. So before ending an auction early, it’s polite to e-mail
everyone in your bidder list, explaining why you’re canceling bids and clos-
ing the auction. If an egregious error in the item’s description is forcing you
to take this action, let your bidders know whether you’re planning to relist
the item with the correct information.
After you’ve e-mailed all the bidders, you must then cancel their bids by
using the bid cancelation form; for the link to this form, see the preceding
section “Canceling bids.”
When ending a listing that has bids, the seller has the option of canceling
all bids or leaving the bids, thus making the high bidder the winner of the
closed listing.
To end a listing, use the drop-down list next to the listing on the All Selling:
Selling page. The screen shown in Figure 5-9 appears. Click the link to end
your listing. You can also go directly to
http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?EndingMyAuction
Following are some legitimate reasons for closing your auction:
✦You no longer want to sell the item. Your account may be subject to a
nonselling seller warning unless you have a good reason.
✦An error occurred in the minimum bid or reserve amount. Perhaps
your spouse really loves that lamp and said you’d better get some good
money for it, but you started the auction at $1.00 with no reserve.
✦The listing has a major error in it. Maybe you misspelled a critical key-
word in the title.
✦The item was somehow lost or broken. Your dog ate it?

I don’t recommend canceling an auction unless you absolutely have to
because it’s just bad business. People rely on your auctions being up for the
stated amount of time. They may be planning to bid at the last minute, or
they may just want to watch the action for a while. Also, if you have bids on
the item, you may be in violation of one of eBay’s policies and be branded as
a nonselling seller.
Blocking buyers
If you don’t want certain buyers bidding on your auctions, you can remove
their capability to do so. Setting up a list of bidders that you don’t want to
do business with is legal on eBay. If someone that you’ve blocked tries to bid
on your auction, the bid won’t go through. A message will be displayed noti-
fying the bidder that he or she can’t bid on the listing and should contact the
seller for more information.
You can block as many as 1000 users from bidding on your auctions.
However, I recommend that you use this option only when absolutely nec-
essary. Situations — and people — change, and it’s best to try to clear up
problems with particular bidders.
You can reinstate a bidder at any time by going to the Buyer Blocking box at
http://pages.ebay.com/services/buyandsell/biddermanagement.html
and deleting the bidder’s user ID.
Preapproving bidders
Suppose that you’re selling a big-ticket item and want to prequalify your bid-
ders. If the bidder has taken advantage of the ID Verify feature, you can be
sure that your bidder is a real person. You can scroll through a bidder’s bid-
ding history to see the amounts they’ve successfully bid in previous auctions
and whether the feedback on those transactions is okay. Although eBay gives
you the tools, you still have to do the research to determine whether you
deem particular bidders trustworthy enough to bid on your special auction.
In your auction, state that bidders must prequalify by sending you an e-mail
claiming their intent to bid. As you receive e-mails and approve bidders’
intentions, you can build your preapproved bidder list.
Your preapproved bidder list is applicable only on an auction-by-auction
basis. In other words, the bidders must be preapproved in the listings you
indicate, not in all your auctions.

eBay Bidder-Management Tools
354
To use this feature, you must supply eBay with the auction number. You can
add approved bidders right up to the close of the auction. Access the form
and enter the preapproved bidders’ names at
http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?PreApproveBidders
If someone who isn’t preapproved tries to bid on your auction, eBay asks
that bidder to contact you by e-mail before placing a bid. After you’ve inves-
tigated the bidder to your satisfaction and are comfortable with that person
bidding on your auction, you can add the bidder’s name to your preapproved
bidder list for that auction.

ayPal is the largest of the online person-to-person payment services.
Thankfully, eBay had the presence of mind to acquire this previously
independent service, so it is now the de facto standard for making payments
on eBay.
PayPal Particulars
PayPal (see Figure 6-1) is a reliable payment service that allows buyers to
safely click and pay with a credit card, eCheck, or PayPal balance directly
from eBay after they’ve won an auction or made a purchase. It’s conve-
niently integrated into all eBay transactions, and if your auction uses the
Buy It Now or Smart Logo feature, you can have buyers immediately pay for
their purchases with PayPal payments.
You must register a special account to accept PayPal payments and you
must have a premier- or business-level account to accept credit card pay-
ments. Buyers may join when they win their first auctions and want to pay
with PayPal, or they can go to www.PayPal.com and sign up. The story is
slightly different for the seller. For convenience, you should set up your
PayPal account before you choose to accept PayPal in your auctions or sales.

PayPal Particulars
356
Here are more than a few particulars about PayPal accounts:
✦Auction payments are deposited into your PayPal account. Choose one
of several ways to get your money:
• Have the money electronically transferred directly into your regis-
tered checking account.
• Receive payment by check (PayPal charges $1.50 for the check).
• Keep the money in your PayPal account for making payments to
other sellers.
• Withdraw the cash from an ATM with a PayPal debit card and get
1.5% cash back on purchases made with the card.
• Shop online with a virtual MasterCard debit card that carries your
balance to any Web site that accepts MasterCard.
✦PayPal has its own feedback system, the Seller Reputation number.
The number after a user’s name reflects the number of unique PayPal-
verified users with which the user has conducted business. The higher
the number, the more likely the user is experienced and trustworthy.
Clicking the number displays a report like the one shown in Figure 6-2.

PayPal Particulars
357
✦As a seller with a premier or business account, you can choose to
accept or deny a payment without a confirmed address. A confirmed
address means that the ship-to address indicated by the buyer is the
same as the billing address on the credit card the buyer chose to regis-
ter with PayPal. On the accept or deny page, information about the
buyer is shown, including verification status, account creation date, and
participation number.
✦PayPal assesses your account $10 for any chargeback. The fee is waived
if you’ve fulfilled the requirements in the PayPal seller protection policy.
To specify whether you want to accept a credit card payment from a
buyer without a confirmed address, log on, go to your account, and then
click the Profile tab. Next, scroll down the Selling Preferences area and
click Payment Receiving Preferences. At the top of the page that’s dis-
played, you have the option of choosing to accept, not accept, or decide
on a case-by-case basis payments from users without confirmed
addresses. If you accept payment from a nonconfirmed address, that
transaction will not be covered by PayPal’s seller protection policy.
✦The PayPal seller protection policy protects you against chargebacks,
unauthorized card use, and nonshipments. To comply with this policy,
you must do the following:
• Have a verified business or premier account: Allow PayPal to con-
firm with your bank that your checking account and address are 
your own.
• Ship to only a confirmed address: PayPal confirms that the buyer’s
ship-to address coincides with the address that the credit company
sends monthly bills to. Fraudulent shoppers often ask you to ship to
another address — don’t do it.

• Keep proof of shipping that can be tracked online: Here’s where
those delivery confirmation things really come in handy. You can
also input your tracking or delivery confirmation numbers on the
PayPal site, and they will send an e-mail to the buyer with that
number.
• Require signature receipt on items valued at more than 
$250.00.
• Ship tangible goods: PayPal doesn’t cover goods transmitted 
electronically.
• Accept only single payments from a single account: Don’t let a
buyer try to pay portions of a purchase from different e-mail address
accounts. Someone who’s trying to pay using several accounts may
be attempting to defraud you.
One of the truly brilliant features of PayPal is that you can download your
sales history and your deposit history to your computer. Although they also
offer files that integrate with QuickBooks (more on QuickBooks in Book IX),
the standard downloads are feature-rich. Rather than importing just sales 
figures, you see each and every detail of your transaction — dates, names,
addresses, phone numbers, amounts, and more. Even fees and taxes (if you
charge sales tax) are broken down separately, making your bookkeeping 
a breeze. The download imports into Microsoft Works (which comes on
almost every new computer) and Excel. Downloading your history will help
you calculate income taxes and sales taxes, reconcile your accounts, predict
sales trends, calculate total revenues, and perform other financial reporting
tasks. It will also give you an excellent customer database.
The deposits download will give you detailed information for all the deposits
that you receive: payments, transaction and deposit fees, refunds, rebates,
and any adjustments made to your account. To find out more about down-
loading, check out Book II, Chapter 4.
Registering with PayPal
If you aren’t registered with PayPal yet (what’s holding you up?), you’ll find a
convenient link on your My eBay: All Selling page in the Selling links area. To
register, just click the PayPal link. The PayPal Seller Overview page appears,
as shown in Figure 6-3. Click the Sign Up button, and you arrive at the begin-
ning of the PayPal registration process. Tell them what country you’re from,
fill in the basic required information, and you’re in.

The convenience of PayPal’s integration with eBay shines when you put the
Smart Logo option in your auctions. Winners just click a link that pops up on
your auction page immediately after the auction closes. When you list auctions,
you preset the shipping and handling charges that appear in the shipping
box at the bottom of the page. When winners click the Pay Now button (see
Figure 6-4), they’re taken directly to a payment page set up with your informa-
tion. It’s just as easy as when they purchase something through Buy It Now.

The buyer can add optional insurance or combine other items, as shown 
in Figure 6-5. When the final total amount is correct, the buyer is brought to
PayPal to pay for the item. The payment is deposited in your PayPal account
and held until you choose how you want to withdraw it.
PayPal accepts payments from more than 45 countries. For a current list of
countries from which PayPal accepts payments, sign on to your PayPal
account and go to the following:
www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_display-approved-
signup-countries
It’s a lovely Web page, and you get to see all the country’s flags.
Because credit card and identity theft is so prevalent on the Internet — and
such an expensive burden to e-commerce — PayPal uses the extra security
measure provided by Visa and MasterCard called CVV2. This system
requires you to input the 3 additional numbers (immediately following the
regular 16-digit number) from the back of your credit card. Because merchants
aren’t allowed to store these numbers, but merely use them for security and
verification purposes, the numbers are presumably protected from hackers.
However, in the unlikely event that your credit card doesn’t have these num-
bers yet, PayPal still allows you to use your card by verifying it through a
procedure known as random charge. PayPal charges about $1 to your card
and asks you to disclose the pin number printed on your statement. Then
PayPal knows that you control the card and didn’t steal it.
Withdraw your funds from the PayPal account on a regular basis; you need
that money to operate your business. Don’t let it become a temporary sav-
ings account — unless you choose the PayPal Money Market fund account
(check out www.PayPal.com for more details). Realize that any money you
have in your account can be extricated for a chargeback, and chargebacks
can be applied as many as 60 days after the transaction. For more about
chargebacks, see Chapter 7.

The Auction and Merchant Tools
When you’re logged into your PayPal account, you’ll see two tabs at the top
of the screen labeled Merchant Tools and Auction Tools. The merchant tools
are mostly for use on your business Web site (discussed in Book VIII). One
that you might find handy is the e-mail invoice tool, discussed later in this
chapter. What you need for your eBay sales are the auction tools. Click the
Auction Tools tab, and the screen shown in Figure 6-6 appears.
It seems PayPal acknowledges that their merchants are more than likely also
sellers on eBay. (Ya think?) In the Auction Tools page, you’ll find lots of links
to all the information you’d ever care to know, including the following:
✦Adding PayPal to your eBay listings: This link goes to your PayPal pref-
erence settings for your auction accounts. Here you may insert PayPal
logos manually or automatically in your eBay sales pages.
On this page you see a list of your PayPal registered eBay user IDs. By
clicking the on/off links, you can turn on and off Automatic Logo
Insertion, Winning Buyer Notification, and PayPal Preferred.
You may also add another eBay user ID (if you have more than one). To
add another user ID, click the Add button. To change any of your eBay
passwords, click the Edit Password button.

Payment Tracking Information
PayPal is the premier tool for verifying that a payment has been made.
Although PayPal has numerous methods for confirming payment, you need
to make the final confirmation.
Payment notification through e-mail
When you receive a payment through PayPal, they send you a payment con-
firmation e-mail. The e-mail is a good tip-off that you’ve received a payment.
Notice I said good, but not infallible.
In these days of spoofed e-mail sent by scammers to remove money from
hard-working people’s wallets, I rarely rely solely on e-mail confirmation.
When I receive one of these e-mails, I open my Internet browser and go right
to PayPal’s secure server at
https://www.PayPal.com
When I get to the PayPal Web site, I can confirm with certainty that the pay-
ment has been made by looking at my PayPal Account Overview.
Post-Sale Manager
Post-Sale Manager is a super tool that just doesn’t get enough credit. Unless
beginning sellers are using Selling Manager or third-party management soft-
ware, they need look no further than the Post-Sale Manager to handle their
auction management business. Because you go to PayPal to check your sales
and deposits anyway, why not use its tools to manage your eBay sales? Best
of all, Post-Sale Manager is free.

To use Post-Sale Manager, follow these steps:
1. Open your browser and go to https://www.PayPal.com.
2. Log in with your e-mail address and password.
The main PayPal Account Overview screen is displayed.
3. Click the Items Sold eBay link.
The link appears under the line showing your PayPal account balance.
After a little whirring and grinding on your hard drive’s part (okay, PayPal’s
hard drive), you’ll see the Post-Sale Manager, as shown in Figure 6-7.
This truly useful tool lists all your recent eBay sales. If the item has been
paid through PayPal, the payment will be noted here. Here’s the lowdown on
the following columns on the Post-Sale Manager screen:
✦Select: If you want to invoice a bunch of sales all at once, put a check in
the box in this column, and then click the Invoice button at the bottom

 Getting paid by money order

 Accepting checks
 Discovering the ins and outs of escrow services
 Setting up a merchant account for credit card payments
Your hard work finally pays off. The hours spent in selecting your items,
photographing them, and writing brilliant auction copy all come down
to one thing: getting paid. At first thought, you might be happy to take 
any form of negotiable paper, bonds, and stocks (okay, no dot-com stock).
However, receiving and processing payments takes time and patience. The
more payment methods that you accept, the more you have to keep track 
of. Narrow the payment choices you offer and you’ll have less bookkeep-
ing hassle. Throughout this chapter, I detail the various payment options
(including how to handle payments from international buyers) and how
each affects your business.
The Simple Money Order
I begin my discussion of payments with money orders and cashier’s checks
because I think they’re just the greatest way to receive payment. Money
orders and cashier’s checks are fast, cheap, and negotiable (just like cash).
Cashier’s checks are purchased at a bank and are generally debited immedi-
ately from the winner’s checking account at purchase. For some unknown
reason, banks take it upon themselves to charge a minimum of $5 to issue a
cashier’s check. This is a pretty steep charge to the winner, which is why I
suggest money orders.
Money orders cost less than a dollar and are available almost anywhere. After
a quick survey of my neighborhood, I found money order dealers galore. All
the stores I spoke to charge 99 cents for a money order up to $500. In this sec-
tion, I detail just four vendors (both online and off) that offer money order
services. Table 7-1 shows a cost comparison of these vendors.

If you want money orders, you should familiarize yourself with the various
charges so that you can recommend the most reasonable amount to your
auction winners. Asking buyers to pay a large fee to pay you is unfair —
unless they’re international. In that case, paying by money order through 
an issuer such as American Express (with offices in most countries) is the
best way for them to pay you. International buyers deal in the currency of
their own countries; when they purchase a money order and send it in dol-
lars, you’re paid with cash in good old American greenbacks.
7-Eleven (and other convenience stores)
There are more than 21,000 7-Eleven stores in the world. I’ll bet there’s one
within driving distance of your house. The best part about 7-Eleven is that
each has an ATM that the customer can use to draw cash from credit cards
with which to purchase a money order. 7-Eleven charges only $.99 for money
orders — a real bargain! If you don’t know where the closest 7-Eleven is, go to
go.vicinity.com/7eleven/prxStart.dsp
Money orders are sold around the country by several convenience store
chains, such as Circle K, Dairy Mart, and AM/PM, as well by many local chains.
United States Postal Service
Most sellers especially love USPS money orders, which have all the benefits
of a regular money order. Plus, because the post office issues these money
orders, the nice clerks at the post office will graciously cash them for you
with proper identification.
Postal money orders are safe and acceptable everywhere. The post office
goes to great pains to ensure authenticity by including a Benjamin Franklin
watermark, a metal security thread, and a double imprint of the dollar
amount on the money order. (No more fears that you’ve received a color
copy of a money order.)

Both domestic money orders and international money orders (for sending
U.S. dollars to foreign countries) are available at post offices in amounts up
to $500.00 for $.90 each. If the money order is lost or stolen (in eBay-speak,
that usually means that the buyer hasn’t sent it to you yet), buyers must
present the receipt for a trace to back their money should a money order get
lost on its way. For a small fee, buyers can also get a copy of a paid money
order (as long as they have the receipt), for as many as two years after the
date it has been paid.
Many sellers bring their money orders to the post office when they ship
their packages and cash them for their petty cash fund or to pay for outgo-
ing postage.
BidPay
BidPay (which, along with Western Union, is a subsidiary of First Data
Corporation) is certainly the most popular money order seller, probably
because it was the first or maybe because it promotes better than anyone
else. BidPay accepts payments from your buyers through a Visa or American
Express debit or credit card, and sends out your payments in the United
States and internationally to you through the mail. Luckily, the United States
has a good postal system, so you can get your money orders from BidPay
swiftly and ship out the item quickly as well. They don’t handle most interna-
tional currencies, but if you’re a seller in the United Kingdom, they will send
your buyer’s funds to you in pounds sterling for an additional $5.00 USD fee.
BidPay charges your customers $1.95 for a payment up to $10.00 all the way
up to $4.95 plus 2.25% for a payment over $100.00. (See Table 7-2 for the fee
schedule.) 7-Eleven is sounding better all the time.

Pay Me When You Get This
I can’t say enough about COD to discourage you from using this payment
method. But I’m gonna try! You give your package to the post office, UPS, 
or FedEx, who collects the payment after delivering the package. Sound
straightforward and easy? What happens when the carrier tries to deliver
the package and the recipient isn’t home? Your item can sit for a week or
two, during which time the buyer may decide that he or she doesn’t want to 
pick up the item from the shipper. If you’re lucky, you’ll get the item back 
in two to three weeks. The cash on delivery service is also expensive. In
addition to postage, the post office charges $5.50 for COD service.
Another bad part of COD? You might wait a month to receive payment, even
when the addressee is home the first time and accepts delivery. Do yourself
a favor and don’t offer it as a payment option. You’re only asking for trouble.
You’re not a bank, and you’re not in the finance business. Get your money up
front.
The Check Is in the Mail
Personal checks are the easiest way for buyers to make payments: They just
dash off a check and put it in the mail. It doesn’t always work out so easy for
the seller. You have to deposit the check into your bank account first and

wait for the check to clear. Believe it or not, in these days of electronic trans-
fers, wiring funds, and international money transfers, you still might wait
more than two weeks for a check to clear.
Paper checks
After you deposit a check, your bank sends it to a central clearinghouse,
which sends it to the signatory’s bank clearinghouse. Then the individual bank
decides whether the check can be paid. You may think that a way around the
system is to call the bank and see whether the account currently has sufficient
money in it. The account may have sufficient funds when you call, but the
check will bounce if the depositor withdraws money before the check gets
through the system. And don’t forget the 24-hour turnaround rule: Even if
the bank has the money and you’re standing there with the check, the bank
can deny payment within 24 hours after telling you the money is in the
account, leaving you with a bad check.
Even though everything seems to be electronic these days, the paper routing
of old-fashioned checks can take two weeks or longer. The only bad check
I’ve ever received as an eBay payment was deposited. After waiting ten 
business days, I shipped the item. On the eleventh business day, I got the
bounced check back from the bank. The buyer clearly knew that the check
had bounced but didn’t notify me. Luckily the buyer made good on the
check.
If you find yourself with a check bouncing higher than a superball and an
uncooperative buyer, remember that it’s against the law to pass bad checks.

Accepting cash payments
I’m sure you’ve received cash from some of your
winners. I don’t like cash. If the buyer doesn’t
send the exact amount due, you have to call the
buyer, who may claim that the correct amount
should be there. Mail can be stolen. We had a
rash of mail thievery where I live; people were
stealing envelopes right out of mailboxes. All of
a sudden, you must have lost the difference —
and you have no recourse with cash.
Postal inspectors are constantly battling this
problem, but you won’t know your mail is being
stolen until you’ve missed enough mail — usu-
ally bills and outgoing checks. Explaining to a
buyer that the money never arrived is difficult.
You can e-mail, phone, talk, and discuss, but the
bottom line is that you haven’t received your
money and the buyer insists that you have.

Hold This for Me
376
For example, if a California or Indiana resident passes a bad check, you are
legally able to collect three times the amount of the bad check!
Bottom line? I warn all my winners that I may hold the check for more than
two weeks before I ship. I make exceptions for buyers I’ve successfully done
business with before or those with an impeccable feedback rating.
Dealing with personal checks isn’t worth the potential grief they can cause.
Try to get an eCheck or an instant transfer through PayPal, as described 
in the next section, or have your winners pay with credit cards through a
payment service, as described in the “I Take Plastic” section, later in this
chapter.
eChecks and instant transfers
Despite the attached fees and a short waiting period, accepting a PayPal
eCheck or an instant transfer is a nice, clean transaction. After indicating
that they want to pay with an eCheck, buyers must register their bank
account with PayPal and give PayPal the information required.
When a buyer pays with an electronic check, it takes as many as four days 
to clear. An instant transfer, on the other hand, credits your account immedi-
ately as long as the buyer has a credit card or bank debit card as a backup
funding source. PayPal allows you to accept eChecks for up to $10,000 but
will charge you the same fees as if you were accepting a credit card.
Hold This for Me
Escrow.com, eBay’s official escrow service, makes it more comfortable for
the buyer to proceed with transactions over $200, which is the upper limit
for eBay fraud protection. Buyers gain peace of mind by using escrow
because they know the transaction will be completed securely and easily. 
A less expensive way to assure your buyer when participating in high-dollar
transactions is called a bonded auction. See Book VIII, Chapter 4 for the
details.
As a new user, your or your buyer must register to use the service. When
you want to offer escrow as a payment option in one of your auctions, be
sure to indicate such on the Sell Your Item form so that it appears on the
auction page. After the auction, the seller should initiate the escrow by going
to the Escrow.com site or to eBay.
To initiate escrow through eBay, click the Services link above the navigation
bar. On the Services page, scroll down and click the Escrow Services link
under Payment. On the resulting page, shown in Figure 7-2, click Start New
Transaction. On the following page, you start the process by typing the eBay
item number.

To proceed with escrow, the buyer must send payment to Escrow.com.
Escrow.com accepts most credit cards (including American Express and
Discover), cashier’s checks, money orders, wire transfers, and personal or
business checks. A check is subject to a ten-day delay.
After the buyer makes the payment, Escrow.com asks the seller to ship the
item to the buyer. When the buyer receives the merchandise, the inspection
period begins promptly at 12:01 a.m. the next weekday and continues for a
time previously set by the buyer and seller.
The buyer notifies Escrow.com that the merchandise is approved, and then
Escrow.com releases payment to the seller. If the buyer doesn’t feel that the
merchandise is what was represented in the listing, the buyer must return
the item to the seller in its original condition, adhering to the Escrow.com
shipping requirements. The buyer also must log on to the Web site to input
return shipping information.
In the event of a return, the seller has the same inspection period to ensure
that the item was returned in its original condition. After that is confirmed,
Escrow.com refunds the buyer (less the escrow fee and, if agreed upon
ahead of time, the shipping fee).
Either the buyer or the seller can pay the escrow fee; the two can even split
the cost. But you need to decide who will pay the fee up front and indicate
this in your auction listing. The buyer is responsible for paying the escrow

Sadly, escrow service has become one of the most highly publicized scams
on the Internet. Unscrupulous sellers set up fake escrow sites, sell a bunch
of high-dollar items to unsuspecting buyers, and then direct the buyers to
the faux escrow Web site to set up their escrow. The buyers send their
money (thinking the transaction is safe), and after the fraudulent sellers col-
lect a bunch of money, they shut down the Web site and abscond with the
money! Many buyers are gun-shy of using escrow to pay for expensive items.
Consider bonding your transactions to lure higher bids and confer a guaran-
tee to the buyer. (Read the details in Book VIII, Chapter 4.)
I Take Plastic
As people become more comfortable using credit cards on the Internet,
credit cards become more popular for eBay payments. Plus, major credit
card payment services have insured eBay payments to registered users,
making credit cards safe for the buyer and easy for you. And credit card
transactions are instantaneous; you don’t have to wait for a piece of paper
to travel cross-country.
For all this instantaneous money transfer, however, you have to pay a price.
Whether you have your own merchant account (a credit card acceptance
account in your business’s name) or take credit cards through a payment
service (more on this in a minute), you pay a fee. Your fees can range from 
2 to 7%, depending on how you plan to accept cards and which ones you
accept. Unfortunately, many states have made it illegal to charge a credit
card surcharge to make up this difference. You have to write off the expense
of accepting credit cards as part of your business budget.
The fees to the seller for accepting credit cards for brick-and-mortar stores
are much less than those for online, mail, or phone orders. In most promo-
tional material, the vendor usually quotes the “swiped card” rates. Since

you won’t have the buyer’s card in hand to swipe, be sure to inquire 
with your provider for the proper rate before signing any papers.
I have to explain the downside of accepting credit cards for your online sales.
To protect yourself, please be sure to check the bidders’ feedback — both
feedback they’ve received and feedback they’ve left — before accepting any
form of credit card payment for a high-ticket item. Some buyers are chronic
complainers and are rarely pleased with their purchases. They may not be
satisfied with your item after it ships. In that case, they can simply call their
credit card company and get credit for the payment; you’ll be charged back
(your account will be debited) the amount of the sale. For more info, see the
“Forget the buyer: Seller beware!” sidebar.
Credit card payment services
Person-to-person payment systems, such as eBay’s PayPal, allow buyers to
authorize payments from their credit cards or checking accounts directly
to the seller. These services make money by charging percentages and
fees for each transaction. It’s all done electronically through an automated
clearinghouse — no fuss, no muss. The payment service releases only the
buyer’s shipping information to the seller; all personal credit card informa-
tion is kept private. This speeds up the time it takes for the buyer to get 
merchandise because sellers are free to ship as soon as the service lets
them know that the buyer has made payment and the payment has been
processed.
From the seller’s point of view, person-to-person payment service transac-
tion fees are lower than the 2.5 to 3.5% (per transaction) that traditional
credit card companies charge for merchant accounts. (Get the details in the
“Your very own merchant account” section, coming up.) So even traditional
retailers may switch their online business to these services to save money.
Throughout this section, I discuss the top payment services and how each
works.
Before you decide which credit card payment service to use, get out your
calculator and check out Web sites for current rates. Calculate your own
estimates; don’t rely on a site’s advertised samples. Charts on the Web sites
tend to leave out certain minor fees. I’ve also found that for promotional pur-
poses (I assume), comparison charts quoting the competition’s prices tend
to include optional fees.
When you pay the fee to your payment service, the total amount of your
transaction — including shipping fees, handling charges, and any sales tax
that you charge — incurs a fee. The payment service charges a percentage
based on the total dollar amount that’s run through its system.

I Take Plastic
380
Your very own merchant account
If your eBay business is bringing in more than $20,000 a month, a credit card
merchant account may be for you. However, I recommend that you look at
the costs carefully. I get at least one e-mail a week begging me to set up my
own merchant account, and each one offers lower fees than the last. But fees
are often hard to calculate and even harder to compare. Charges are buried
in the small print. Even those who advertise low fees often don’t deliver. Be
sure to look at the entire picture before you sign a contract.
Forget the buyer: Seller beware!
When a buyer disputes a sale, he or she can
simply call PayPal or the credit card company
and refuse to pay for the item; you lose the sale
and possibly won’t be able to retrieve your mer-
chandise. A payment service or merchant
account will then charge back your account
without contacting you and without negotiat-
ing. Technically, the buyer has made the pur-
chase from the payment service — not from
you — and the payment service won’t defend
you. I’ve heard of chargebacks occurring as
long as two months after the transaction. And
no one is standing at your side, forcing the
buyer to ship the merchandise back to you. Just
like eBay fraud protection — see Book I,
Chapter 5 — the credit card companies skew
the rules to defend the consumer. As the seller,
you have to fend for yourself; see the same
chapter on how to report fraudulent buyers. You
usually have no way to verify that the shipping
address is actually the one the credit card bills
to. So, to add to your problems, the card may
actually be stolen.
PayPal confirms through AVS (address verifi-
cation service) that the buyer’s credit card
billing address matches the shipping address;
PayPal gives you the option to not accept pay-
ments from buyers whose addresses don’t
match. PayPal offers seller protection against
spurious chargebacks under certain circum-
stances:
 Credit card chargebacks from fraudulent
card use
 Credit card chargebacks for false claims of
nondelivery
 Buyer complaints for false claims of non-
delivery
If the issuing bank resolves a chargeback in the
buyer’s favor, PayPal charges you $10 if you are
determined to be the one at fault, but waives
the fee if you meet all the requirements of the
PayPal seller protection policy.
Here’s some good news: Major credit card
companies are trying to curb online fraud for
their merchant accounts. Visa has the new
Verified by Visa acceptance, which takes
buyers to a Visa screen (through software
installed on the merchant’s server) and verifies
their identity through a Visa-only password.
MasterCard uses SET (Secure Electronic
Transactions), a similar encrypted transaction
verification scheme. These systems are
expected to substantially reduce fraud and
chargebacks.

The best place to begin looking for a merchant account may be your own bank.
Your bank knows you, your credit history, and your business reputation, and
has a vested interest in the success of your business. If, for whatever reason,
your credit isn’t up to snuff, I recommend building good credit before pursu-
ing a merchant account; as your business grows, your credit rating is your
feedback to the offline world.
If your bank doesn’t offer merchant accounts for Internet-based businesses,
find a broker to evaluate your credit history and hook you up with a bank
that fits your needs and business style. (As a last resort, join Costco, as
detailed in the following section.) These brokers make their money from
your application fee, from a finder’s fee at the bank that you finally choose,
or from both.
After you find a bank, you’re connected to a processor (or transaction clear-
inghouse). Your bank merely handles the banking; the clearinghouse is on
the other end of your Internet connection when you’re processing transac-
tions, checking whether the credit card you’re taking is valid and not stolen
or maxed out.
The next step is setting up your gateway, the software (ICVerify or PCAuthorize,
for example) with which you transmit charges to the clearinghouse. Some
gateways use HTML Web sites and take the transactions directly on Web-
based forms (Cybercash or VeriFone, among others). Web-based gateways
connect your Web forms to real-time credit card processing.
In Table 7-4, I highlight various possible costs associated with setting up and
maintaining a merchant account. Remember that not all merchant accounts
pass on these charges. Some may charge just a few and others may have a
bunch of little snipes at your wallet.
In the following list, I define some of the fees listed in Table 7-4:
✦Setup fee: A one-time cost that you pay to your bank or your broker.
✦Discount rate: A percentage of the transaction amount (a discount from
your earnings that goes to the bank) taken off the top along with the
transaction fee before the money is deposited into your account.
✦Transaction fee: A fee per transaction paid to the bank or to your gate-
way; the fee pays for the network.
✦Gateway or processing fee: Your fee for processing credit cards in real
time that’s paid to the Internet gateway.
✦Application fee: A one-time fee that goes to the broker or perhaps to
the bank.

✦Monthly minimum processing fee: If your bank’s cut of your purchases
doesn’t add up to this amount, the bank takes it anyway. For example, if
your bank charges a minimum monthly fee of $20, and you don’t hit $20
in fees because your sales aren’t high enough, the bank charges you the
difference.

If you’re comfortable with all the information in the preceding list and in
Table 7-4, and you’re looking for a broker, heed my advice and read every-
thing a broker offers carefully. Be sure you aren’t missing any hidden costs.
Costco member’s credit card processing
Here’s some true discount credit card processing: a one-stop merchant
account and gateway in one! Now you can not only buy a case of giant-sized
cans of tuna fish with a Costco membership, but also obtain a reasonably
priced way to handle a merchant account through the Nova Network.
Costco has gotten together with Nova Information Systems, one of the nation’s
largest processors of credit card transactions, to offer Costco executive mem-
bers a discounted Internet credit card processing service. See Table 7-5 for a
list of fees. Costco executive membership brings the cost of a Costco mem-
bership up from $45 to $100, but you get the benefit of receiving 2% back for
most purchases (not including tobacco, gas, food, and some other purchases).

I
bet that it’s not a surprise to you that most eBay sellers lack a solid retail
education. Most of us come from different walks of life, and all we know
about retailing is shopping — that’s probably how we first found eBay. Now
that game is about to change. The more we sell, the more our businesses
grow, and the more we need to know about retail.
eBay sellers use many types of business models. Some sellers are constantly
on the prowl for new products and stock their merchandise as soon as they
find a deal. Others follow the trends and try to get stock of the latest and
greatest gizmo that they hope will sweep the country (and eBay). And sell-
ers who run their business by selling for others are constantly beating the
pavement for new customers to serve. Then there’s the new eBay e-tailer.
Just like a brick-and-mortar retailer, today’s eBay e-tailers have to keep up
on the trends so that they can stock up on the most popular items for the
coming seasons.
The Six-Month Marketing Plan
The eBay e-tailer buys merchandise to sell on eBay. E-tailers are always look-
ing for new wholesalers, but the e-tailers usually specialize in a particular
type of stock item, such as dolls, sports cards, lighting fixtures, or apparel.
Their eBay business is organized; they sell their merchandise and then buy
more to replenish their stock. But is this the best way to handle things? It
definitely works for most sellers, but those who studied retailing know that
there’s a better way.

The Six-Month Marketing Plan
388
One of the first things one learns when studying retail buying is the use of a
six-month merchandise plan. It’s the ultimate tool in the arsenal of a success-
ful retail buyer. Although it was originally designed for brick-and-mortar
retailers, I’ve adapted it here for eBay e-tailers.
After you fill out the plan, you’ll be able to combine it with the reports gener-
ated by your bookkeeping program to get a clear, concise picture of your
eBay business. (I explain proper bookkeeping in Book IX.) This is a business
and not a guessing game, and handling your business in a professional
manner will save you a great deal of time and money.
I admit that running by the seat of your pants is fun and exciting, but it’s not
a solid business practice. One of the reasons I started my own business is
that an unorganized business format appealed to me. To my dismay, I soon
learned that organization and planning really did make a difference in my
bottom line.
Anyone who has participated in management in a corporation knows about
the annual plan. Every year, management gets together (with Ouija and dart
boards) to projects sales, expenses, and profits for the coming year. From
this annual exercise, the budget for the coming year arises. These are the
magic numbers that form everyone’s annual raises — along with the com-
pany’s plans for growth.
So, assuming that eBay sellers are online retailers, retail evaluation could
help eBay sellers make sound business decisions. Making a merchandise
plan is a good step in that direction. A merchandise plan covers six months
at a time and sets sales goals. It also helps estimate how much money must
be spent on merchandise (and when) so that a particular season’s success
can be replicated and magnified.
Getting the data
You need a few numbers to get your plan on paper. If you aren’t using book-
keeping software yet, you must put together a report that reflects the dollar
value of your existing inventory. (Book IX, Chapters 2 and 3 will give you
more insights.) If you are using bookkeeping software, you can get these
numbers easily from the program’s Inventory Valuation report:
✦BOM: The value, in dollars, of your beginning-of-month inventory
✦EOM: The value, in dollars, of your end-of-month inventory
✦Gross sales: Total revenue from sales (not including shipping and 
handling)
✦Markdowns: Total revenue of merchandise you have sold on eBay below
your target price

Book IV
Chapter 1
Understanding
Online Retailing
The Six-Month Marketing Plan
389
The EOM figure for a specific month is the same as the BOM figure for the
following month. For example, the end-of-month figure for April is the same
as the beginning-of-month figure for May.
To put together your six-month plan, you need to have sales history for a six-
month period. To get a good historical picture of your sales, however, it’s
preferable to have at least an entire year’s worth of figures.
Your six-month plan can be based on your total eBay sales or only one seg-
ment of your business. For example, if you sell musical instruments along
with many other sundry items, but you want to evaluate your musical 
instrument sales, you can use just those figures for a six-month plan for
your music department.
What you’re going to establish is your inventory turnover. You’ll measure 
how much inventory sells out in a specified period of time. The faster you turn
over merchandise, the sooner you can bring in new merchandise and increase
your bottom line. You can also evaluate whether you need to lower your start-
ing price to move out stale inventory to get cash to buy new inventory.
When you prepare your six-month plan, set out the months not by the regu-
lar calendar but by a retail calendar, which divides the year into the seasons
of fall/winter (August 1 through January 31) and spring/summer (February 1
through July 31). This way, if you want to refer to top national performance
figures in trade publications or on the Internet, you can base your figures on
the same standardized retail seasons.
Formulas that calculate your data
Okay, I can admit that bigger minds than mine came up with standard formu-
las for calculating business success. These formulas are used by retailers
around the world. If you’re not pulling the figures from a bookkeeping pro-
gram, you can make the calculations as follows:
✦EOM stock = BOM stock + Purchases – Sales
✦BOM stock = EOM stock from the previous month
✦Sales + EOM – BOM = monthly planned purchases
You can make your calculations in dollar amounts or number of units of the
item. To figure out how much of an item to buy, you must know how much
you have left in stock.
Prepare a chart for your own business, similar to the one shown in Table 1-1.
Study your results and find out which months are your strongest. Let the
table tell you when you might have to boost your merchandise selection in
lagging months. It will help bring your planning from Ouija board to reality.

Marketing to Your Customers
When you’re in business, you can’t just consider yourself a retailer; you have
to be a marketer too. eBay enables sellers in the United States to market
across a massive geographic area. I’m sure you know how large the area is,
but what about the people you sell to? You’ve heard of advertising being 
targeted to the lucrative 18-to-49 age demographic, but what about all the
other age groups? Who are they? If you learn about your customer, you’ll
know how to sell to them. It’s all about targeting.
Decide who buys what you want to sell or, better yet, decide with whom you
want to deal. If you don’t want to deal with e-mails from teenage gamers, for
example, perhaps you shouldn’t be selling items that Gen N (defined in a
moment) is gonna want.
Marketers often provide blanket definitions about the population based on
their stage in life, what they are expected to buy, and which activities they
participate in. The marketing generations are formed less by biological dates
than by life experiences and influences. We all know that outside influences
make a big difference in how we look at things; they also affect how and why
we buy things.

Table 1-2 gives you the population figures of the United States. With the
knowledge from this table. you can better decide just how many people will
be shoppers for your products in the future. The total population in the 2000

and 50.9% female.

Knowing the Current Market
Just as successful stockbrokers know about individual companies, they also
need to know about the marketplace as a whole. Sure, I know about the 300
Beanie Babies out there, and so does nearly everyone else. To get a leg up on
your competition, you need to know the big picture as well. Here are some
questions you should ask yourself as you contemplate making buckets of
money by selling items at eBay:
✦What items are currently hot? If you see everyone around you rushing
to the store to buy a particular item, chances are good that the item will
become more valuable as stocks of it diminish. The simple rule of supply
and demand says that whoever has something everyone else wants
stands to gain major profits.
✦Do I see a growing interest in a specific item that might make it a big
seller? If you’re starting to hear talk about a particular item, or even an
era (’70s nostalgia? ’60s aluminum Christmas trees? Who knew?), listen
carefully and think of what you own or can get your hands on that can
help you catch a piece of the trend’s action.

Catching Trends in the Media
392
✦Should I hold on to this item and wait for its value to increase, or
should I sell now? Knowing when to sell an item that you think people
may want is a tricky business. Sometimes, you catch the trend too early
and find out that you could have commanded a better price if you had
waited. Other times, you may catch a fad that’s already passé. It’s best to
test the market with a small quantity of your hoard, dribbling items indi-
vidually into the market until you’ve made back the money you spent to
acquire them. When you have your cash back, the rest will be gravy.
✦Is a company discontinuing an item I should stockpile now and sell
later? Pay attention to discontinued items, especially toys and novelty
items. If you find an item that a manufacturer has a limited supply of,
you could make a tidy profit. If the manufacturer ends up reissuing the
item, don’t forget that the original run is still the most coveted and 
valuable.
✦Was there a recall, an error, or a legal proceeding associated with my
item? If so, how will it affect the value of the item? For example, a toy
recalled for reasons other than safety may no longer be appropriate, but
it could be rare and collectible if sealed and intact.
Some people like to go with their gut feeling about when and what to buy for
resale at eBay. By all means, if instinct has worked for you in the past, factor
instinct in here, too. If your research looks optimistic but your gut says, “I’m
not sure,” listen to it; don’t assume you’re just hearing that lunchtime taco
talking. Test the waters by purchasing one of the prospective items for resale
at eBay. If that sale doesn’t work out, you won’t have a lot of money invested,
and you can credit your gut with saving you some bucks.
Catching Trends in the Media
Catching trends is all about listening and looking. You can find all kinds of
inside information from newspapers, magazines, television, and of course,
Exploiting your talent
If you’re talented in any way, you can sell your
services on eBay. Home artisans, chefs, and
even stay-at-home psychics are transacting
business daily on the site. What a great way 
to make money on eBay — make your own
product!
Many custom items do well on eBay. People go
to trendy places (when they have the time) such
as Soho, the Grove, or the Village to find unique
custom jewelry. They also go to eBay. There’s a
demand for personalized invitations, cards, and
announcements — and even return address
labels. Calligraphic work or computer-designed
items are in big demand today, but no one
seems to have the time to make them. Savvy
sellers with talent can fill this market niche.

the Internet. Believe it or not, you can even find out what people are inter-
ested in these days by bribing a kid. Keep your eyes and ears open. When
people say, “That Taco Bell Chihuahua is everywhere these days,” instead of
nodding your head vacantly, start getting ideas.
In newspapers
Newspapers are bombarded by press releases and inside information from
companies the world over. Look for stories about celebrities and upcoming
movies and see whether any old fads are making a resurgence (you can sell
items as retro chic).
Read the accounts from trade conventions, such as the New York Toy Fair or
the Consumer Electronics show. New products are introduced and given the
thumbs up or down by journalists. Use the information to help determine
the direction of your area of expertise.
On television
No matter what you think of television, it has an enormous effect on which
trends come and go and which ones stick. Why else would advertisers sink
billions of dollars into TV commercials? For example, one Oprah appearance
for an author can turn a book into an overnight bestseller. Tune in to morn-
ing news shows and afternoon talk shows. The producers of these shows are
on top of pop culture and move fast to be the first to bring you the next big
thing. Take what they feature and think of a marketing angle. If you don’t,
you can be sure somebody else will.
Catch up with youth culture . . .
. . . or at least keep good tabs on it. If you remember cranking up The
Beatles, James Brown, or The Partridge Family (say what?) until your par-
ents screamed, “Shut that awful noise off,” you may be at that awkward time
of life when you hardly see the appeal of what young people are doing or lis-
tening to. But if you want tips for hot auction items, tolerate the awful noise
and listen to the kids around you. Children, especially preteens and teens,
may be the best trend-spotters on the planet.
Check out magazines
Magazines geared to the 18-to-34 age group (and sometimes to younger
teens) can help you stay on top of what’s hot. See what the big companies
are pitching to this target audience (and whether they’re succeeding). If a
celebrity is suddenly visible in every other headline or magazine, be on the
lookout for merchandise relating to that person. (Are we talking hysteria-
plus-cash-flow here, or just hysteria?)

Finding eBay’s Soon-to-Be-Hot Sellers
Everyone wants to know what the hot ticket is on the eBay site. They want
to know what’s selling best so that they can run out, buy it, and make big
money on eBay. Whoa, there, big fella.
As you may know, I’m not a believer in the notion that eBay is a get-rich-quick
program. Nobody can give you secret information that magically transforms
you from a garage seller to a warehouse tycoon overnight. You get there by
studying the market and finding out what works and what doesn’t. There are
no shortcuts. That said, here’s where you can find information on what’s hot
or what’s going to be hot on the site.
Hot on the home page
New shoppers to the site generally enter from the home page, as shown in
Figure 1-1. In case you haven’t noticed, eBay runs promotions smack dab in
the center of the home page — immediately drawing the attention of anyone
who drops in to browse the site. Featured items link to an eBay search for
such items.
Now wouldn’t you be the smart one if you were to list items that coincided
with the eBay promotions? Oh yeah — and I’ll tell you where you can find
out what eBay will be listing on the home page ahead of time.

trends are what you look for to follow into the world of eBay.
You can find the beginnings of buzz in any news report or on your Internet
provider’s home page. Yahoo!, for example, has Yahoo!’s Buzz Index, at
buzz.yahoo.com. It’s a weekly compilation of items that have received the
largest number of searches on their system. You can see what’s new on the

Chapter 2: Buying Merchandise
Like the Pros
In This Chapter
 Taking the mystery out of finding merchandise
 Getting the best wholesale deals
 Finding unusual (and cheap) deals
I
’m often asked, “Where do I find merchandise to sell on eBay?” This, of
course, is followed by “What can I sell to make the most money on eBay?”
Good questions. But what successful sellers have an answer they want to
give to the competition?
When eBay PowerSellers have a good, solid source of merchandise, they’re
not likely to share the name of that source with anyone — nor would any
brick-and-mortar retailer. (Think about it a minute.) When I was teaching a
class for advanced sellers at eBay Live in Orlando, Florida, I was asked the
question in an auditorium-size room filled with PowerSellers. I answered a
question with a question: Were there any PowerSellers in the audience who
would like to share their sources with the rest of the group? You could have
heard a pin drop. So I upped the ante — “I’ll pay anyone $10 for one solid
source” — still silence. Business is business.
The bottom line here is that all successful sellers tweak out their own
sources. What works for one may not work for another. Methods for finding
goods that I include in this chapter are gleaned from my own research, as
well as from interviews with successful online retailers.
Buying for Retail 101
If you’re not sure what you want to sell for profit at eBay — but you’re a
shop-till-you-drop person by nature — incorporate your advanced shopping
techniques into your daily routine. If you find a bargain that interests you,
chances are you have a knack for spotting stuff that other shoppers would
love to get their hands on.

Buying for Retail 101
398
When you’re new at eBay selling, you probably want to get your feet wet
first, before shelling out large sums for wholesale merchandise. Some great
deals are available in the open market for resale!
The hunt for e-Bay inventory
Check your favorite eBay category and see what the hot-selling item is.
Better yet, go to your favorite store and make friends with the manager.
Figuring out who’s who in the industry
It would be simple if you just bought merchan-
dise from a manufacturer. But that’s rarely the
case. A full team of players participate in the
wholesale game, and each player performs a
different task, as follows:
 Manufacturers: Buying directly from a
manufacturer may get you great prices, but
it may not be the place for a beginner to
start. Manufacturers usually require large
minimum orders from retailers. Unless you
have a group of other sellers (perhaps a
friend who owns a retail store?) to split
your order with, you may have to make your
purchase from a middleman.
An exception to the large-quantity require-
ment may be in the apparel industry.
Because apparel has distinct, rapidly
changing fashion seasons, a quick turn-
over in merchandise is a must. Apparel
manufacturers may allow you to make small
purchases towards the end of the season to
outfit your eBay store. It never hurts to ask.
 Wholesalers: Here’s your first step to find-
ing your middleman. Wholesalers purchase
direct from the manufacturer in large quan-
tities. They sell the merchandise to smaller
retailers who can’t take advantage of the
discounts from manufacturers for large
orders.
Find a wholesaler who is familiar with 
(or better yet, specializes in) the type of
merchandise you want to sell. Obviously,
someone who specializes in prerecorded
DVDs and videos will not have a clue about
the fashion market and vice versa. 
Don’t forget to check local wholesalers, as
described in the “Finding merchandise
locally” section.
 Manufacturer’s reps: These are generally
the type of people you’ll meet at trade shows
or marts. They represent one or many non-
competing manufacturers and selling their
merchandise to retailers for a commission.
 Jobbers or brokers: These independent
businesspeople buy merchandise anywhere
they can at distressed prices. They deal
mostly in liquidation or salvage merchan-
dise. To find out more about this source, see
Chapter 3.
Don’t forget to negotiate. Almost everything in
the wholesale merchandise world is negotiable.
Although merchandise may have a set price, you
may be able to get a discount if you offer to pay
on delivery or within ten days. Ask whether they
can help you out with shipping costs and per-
haps promotions. They just may give you a dis-
count if you promote their product through
banner ads. Ask, ask, ask. The worst they can
say is no.

Store managers will often tell you what’s going to be the new hot item next
month. After you’re armed with the information you need, search out that
item for the lowest price you can, and then give it a shot on eBay.
Keep these shopping locales in mind when you go on the eBay hunt:
✦Upscale department stores, trendy boutiques, outlet stores, or flagship
designer stores are good places to do some market research. Check out
the newest items and then head to the clearance area or outlet store and
scrutinize the bargain racks for brand-name items.
✦Discount club stores such as Sam’s Club and Costco made their mark 
by selling items in bulk to large families, clubs, and small businesses. In
case you haven’t noticed, these stores have recently upscaled and sell
just about anything you could want. And both Sam’s Club and Costco
have Web sites: auctions.samsclub.com and www.costco.com.
In another book, I talked about a special on the Costco Web site, www.
costco.com, for a new Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs DVD. For $18.49,
you could pre-order the Snow White DVD and get a second Disney DVD
for free. When there’s an offer like this, you can sell two items on eBay
for the price of one. If I had followed my own advice and bought a case
of this deal and held some for future sales, I’d be in the money today. It
seems that Disney movies are released for a limited time only. That origi-
nal DVD set now sells on eBay for around $40.
When an item is new but has some collectibility, I suggest you buy in
bulk, sell some of the item to repay your investment, and save the bal-
ance for later. This has paid off for me a good many times with Disney
films, Barbies, and Andy Warhol dinnerware.
✦Tour dollar stores in your area. Many of the items these places carry are
overruns (too many of something that didn’t sell), small runs (too little of
something that the big guys weren’t interested in stocking), or out-of-
date fad items that need a good home at eBay. I’ve found profitable books,
Olympics memorabilia, and pop culture items at this type of store.
It’s not unusual for dollar store warehouses to sell direct to a retailer
(that’s you). Find out where the distribution warehouse is for your local
dollar store chain and make contact. The 99¢ Only stores, for example
have a wholesale unit called Bargain Wholesale that runs out of their
City of Commerce California offices. They sell directly to retailers, dis-
tributors, and exporters.
✦Thrift stores are packed with used but usually good-quality items. And
you can feel good knowing that the money you spend in a nonprofit
thrift shop is going to a good cause. Some branches of Goodwill and the
Salvation Army receive merchandise from a central warehouse. Ask the
manager (whom you’ve befriended) when the truck regularly comes in.

Goodwill Industries is definitely gearing up for the 21st century. You can
shop at its online auctions and get super values on the best of their mer-
chandise. Don’t forget to check the going prices on eBay before you buy.
Have fun at www.shopgoodwill.com.
✦Garage, tag, moving, and estate sales offer some of the biggest bargains
you’ll ever come across. The stuff you find at estate sales is often of a
higher quality. Keep an eye out for “moving to a smaller house” sales.
These are usually people who have raised children, accumulated a
houseful of stuff (collectibles? old toys? designer vintage clothes?), and
want to shed it all so that they can move to a condo in Palm Springs.
✦Two types of auctions where you can pick up bargains are liquidation
and estate auctions. Before you go to any auction, double-check payment
terms and find out whether you must bring cash or can pay by credit
card. Also, before you bid on anything, find out the hammer fee, or buyer’s
premium. These fees are a percentage that auction houses add to the
winner’s bid; the buyer has the responsibility of paying these fees.
When a company gets into serious financial trouble, its debtors (the
people to whom the company owes money) obtain a court order to liqui-
date the company to pay the bills. The liquidated company then sells its
stock, fixtures, and even real estate in a liquidation auction. Items sell
for just cents on the dollar, and you can easily resell many of these items
on eBay. Look in the phone book under Auctioneers: Liquidators and
call local auctioneers’ offices to get on mailing lists.
Estate auctions are the higher level of estate garage sales. Here you can
find fine art, antiques, paper ephemera, rare books, and collectibles of
all kinds. These auctions are attended mostly by dealers, who know the
local going prices for the items they bid on. But because they’re buying
to sell in a retail environment, their high bids will generally be the whole-
sale price for your area. And local dealers are buying what’s hot to resell
in your city — not what’s going to sell across the country. That entire
market will be yours.
✦Find going-out-of-business sales. Some sales run week by week, with
bigger discounts as time goes by. Don’t be shy about making an offer on
a quantity of items.
Going-out-of-business sales can be a bonanza, but be careful and don’t
be misled. Many states require businesses that are putting on a going-
out-of business sale to purchase a special license that identifies the 
business as really going out of business. Some store ads may read
“Going Out for Business” or some similar play on words, so you need
to be sure that you’re going to the real thing.
✦Take advantage of flea markets or swap meets in your area.

✦Gift shops at museums, monuments, national parks, and theme parks
can provide eBay inventory — but think about where to sell the items.
Part of your selling success on eBay is access. People who can’t get to
Graceland may pay handsomely for an Elvis miniguitar with the official
logo on the box.
✦Hang on to the freebies you get. Freebies are usually samples or promo-
tion pieces that companies give away to introduce a new product, service,
or, best of all, a media event. If you receive handouts (lapel pins, pencils,
pamphlets, books, interesting napkins, flashlights, towels, stuffed toys)
from a sporting event, premiere, or historic event — or even a collectible
freebie from a fast-food restaurant — they could be your ticket to some
eBay sales. For example, when Return of the Jedi was re-released in 1997,
the first 100 people to enter each theater got a Special Edition Luke
Skywalker figure. These figures are still highly prized by collectors and
when the next part of the Star Wars saga is released, you can bet the
prices on this figure will rise yet again.
When you go to the cosmetic counter and buy a way-too-expensive item,
ask for tester-sized samples. Name brand cosmetic and perfume samples
of high-priced items sell well on eBay. Also, look for gift with purchase
deals. If it’s a specialty item, you can usually sell it on its own to some-
one who’d like to try a sample themselves rather than plunge headlong
into a large purchase. Less special items can be grouped together as
lots. Be sure to put the brand names in the title.
One of my mottoes is “Buy off-season, sell on-season.” You can get great bar-
gains on winter merchandise in the heat of summer. January’s a great time 
to stock up on Christmas decorations, and the value of those trendy vintage
aluminum trees doubles in November and December. Cashmere sweaters,
too! In the winter, you can get great deals on closeout summer sports mer-
chandise. It’s all in the timing.
Resale items on eBay
Another place to find items to sell is on eBay itself. Look only for good-quality
merchandise to resell. Remember that the only way to make a living on eBay
is to sell quality items to happy customers so that they’ll come back and buy
from you again.
Be sure to search eBay auction titles for the following keywords: resale, resell,
“case of” (see Figure 2-1), “case quantity”, “lot of”, “pallet of”, closeout, and
surplus. Use the quotes anywhere that I’ve included them here because this
forces the search engine to find the words in the exact order.

Buying for Retail 101
402
Also be sure you check out the wholesale categories on eBay. After noticing
how many sellers were buying from other sellers, eBay set up wholesale sub-
categories for almost every type of item. You can find the wholesale items in
the category list on the left side of the page after performing a search, or just
go to the eBay home page, scroll down the list of categories, and click Whole-
sale. You’ll be brought to the Wholesale hub page, as shown in Figure 2-2.
Just click the category of your choice to find some great deals.

Tuesday Morning
One of my editors is going to kill me for men-
tioning one of her favorite eBay merchandise
sources, but here it is: Tuesday Morning, which
has more than 500 stores scattered over the
United States. They sell first-quality designer
and brand-name closeout merchandise at
deep-deep discounts, 50% to 80% below retail.
The key here is that the store sells recogniz-
able brand names, the kind of items that eBay
shoppers look for. I’ve seem items at their store 
from Samsonite, Thomas Kincade, Limoges,
Wedgwood, Royal Doulton, Madame Alexander,
and even Barbie! Find your local store at their
Web site, www.tuesdaymorning.com. If you
sign up for their eTreasures newsletter, you’ll
get advance notice of when the really good stuff
arrives at the store.

Tips for the modest investor
If you’re interested in making money in your eBay ventures but you’re start-
ing with limited cash, follow this list of eBay inventory do’s and don’ts:
✦Don’t spend more than you can afford to lose. If you shop at boutiques
and expensive department stores, buy things that you like to wear your-
self (or give as gifts) in case they don’t sell.
✦Do try to find something local that’s unavailable in a wider area. For
example, if you live in an out-of-the-way place that has a local specialty,
try selling that at eBay.
✦Don’t go overboard and buy something really cheap just because it’s
cheap. Figure out who would want the item first.
✦Do consider buying in bulk, especially if you know the item sells well on
eBay or is inexpensive. Chances are good that if you buy one and it sells
well on eBay, the item will be sold out by the time you try to buy more. If
an item is inexpensive (say $.99), I always buy at least five. If no one bids
on the item when you hold your auction, you’re only out $5. (Anyone out
there need any Bicentennial commemorative coffee mugs?)

As an eBay seller, no doubt you’ll receive tons of spam (unsolicited e-mails)
guaranteeing that the sender has the hottest-selling items for you to sell on
eBay. Think about this for a second. If you had the hot ticket, wouldn’t you
be selling it on eBay and making the fortune yourself? These people make
money by preying on those who think there’s a magic way to make money
on eBay. There isn’t. It takes old-fashioned elbow grease and research.
Buying Wholesale
After you get the hang of finding items in stores to resell on eBay, it’s time 
to move to the wholesale source. As a side note, I want you to know that
although my eBay business is based on wholesale merchandise, I still love
going to the sources mentioned in the last section and finding great deals to
resell. It’s become a fun hobby! Don’t we all love to find a piece of merchan-
dise that we know we can sell for a profit?
Okay, you want to set up shop on eBay. You kind of know what type of mer-
chandise you want to sell, but you don’t know where to turn. Anyone in 
the brick-and-mortar world who plans to open a new store faces the same
quandary: finding merchandise that will sell quickly at a profit.
Merchandise that sits around doesn’t give you cash flow, which is the name
of the game in any business. (Cash flow = profit = money to buy better, or
more, merchandise.) I spoke to several successful retailers and they all gave
me the same answers about where they began their quest. The upcoming
sections give you a look at the answers these retailers shared.
Setting up to buy
Purchasing wholesale merchandise may require that you have your state’s
resale license, which identifies you as being in the business. Be sure that you
have one before you try to purchase merchandise directly from another busi-
ness. Also, when you have a resale number and purchase merchandise from
another business — known as a business to business (B2B) transaction — you
probably won’t be charged sales tax when you purchase your stock because
you’ll be paying sales tax when you sell the items. Go to Book IX, Chapter1 to
find out how to get that magic resale number.
When you have your resale number, you can go anywhere you want to 
buy merchandise. If you want to buy direct from a manufacturer, you can.
Unfortunately, many manufacturers have a minimum order amount, which
may be more than you want to spend (and you’d get more of a particular
item than you’d ever want at once). To remedy that, see whether you can
find independent retailers who buy in quantity and who perhaps will let you

Book IV
Chapter 2
Buying Merchandise
Like the Pros

405
in on some quantity buys with manufacturers. I often buy in with a couple of
local shops when they purchase their orders.
To gain access to legitimate wholesale sources, you must be a licensed busi-
ness in your city or county. You also usually have to have a resale permit
and tax ID number from your state. (See Book IX, Chapter 1 for details.)
Finding merchandise locally
Always remember that the cost of shipping the merchandise to you adds a
great deal of expense. The higher your expense, the lower your return may
be. The more you buy locally to resell, the more profit you can make.
The first place most potential retailers go is to their local wholesale district.
You can find yours in your yellow pages (remember that giant brick of a
book they drop in your driveway once a year) under the name of your item.
For example, suppose you want to sell women’s apparel. Look up Women’s
Apparel in the yellow pages and find the Wholesale subcategory. Bingo!
Immediate merchandise sources, within driving distance of your home! Also
be sure to check the directories in neighboring communities as well. The
value of this printed (and usually overlooked) resource is immeasurable
when you’re starting up a business.
Newspaper auction listings
Another excellent source of merchandise for resale is your newspaper, par-
ticularly the listings of liquidations and estate auctions (usually on Saturday)
and the daily classified section, which often has ads that announce local
business liquidations. Do not confuse any of this with garage sales or flea-
market sales (run by individuals and a great source for one-of-a kind items).
Liquidation and estate sales are professionally run, usually by licensed liq-
uidators or auctioneers and involve merchandise that may be new but is
always sold in lots (in a quantity).
If your local newspaper has a Web site, use their online search to view the
classifieds for major liquidations, estate auctions, or other similar deals.
Right there online, you can often find just what you are looking for locally. 
To find the paper’s Web site, run a search on Google like the one shown in
Figure 2-3.
Regional merchandise marts
Your next stop, should you be lucky enough to live in a major metropolitan
area, is to find out whether there’s a merchandise or fashion mart near you.
These are giant complexes that hold as many as several thousand lines of
merchandise in one area.

Buying Wholesale
406
Merchandise marts are hubs for wholesale buyers, distributors, manufactur-
ers, and independent sales representatives. They have showrooms within
the property for manufacturers or their representatives to display their 
current merchandise. Under one roof, you may find both fashion and gift
merchandise for your eBay business.
See Table 2-1 for a representative sprinkling of the many marts across the
country. This is not a comprehensive list, just one to get your mind moving.
You can contact the individual marts for tenant lists and more information.
If you’re a legitimate business, they will be more than happy to teach you the
ropes and get you started.

My favorite, the California Market Center (their Web site is shown in Figure 2-4),
even has a special program for new buyers, offering tons of useful informa-
tion to help newbies get going.
When you go to each mart’s Web site, you’ll find hundreds of links to whole-
sale sources. Many marts also send you a directory of the manufacturers
represented in the mart.
Wholesale trade shows
By checking out the links to the marts listed in Table 2-1, you’ll also end up
with links to the thousands of wholesale trade shows that go on across the
country each year. Trade shows are commonly held in convention centers,
hotels, and local merchandise marts.
A super source for finding gift shows is the greatrep.com Web site, shown in
Figure 2-5. They list all the major gift shows with clickable links for contact
information for the show coordinators. For more on greatrep.com, see the
“Buying Online for Resale” section.
When visiting a show or a mart, view all merchandise before you place an
order. Bring a notebook with you to make copious notes of items you find
interesting and where you find them.

These shows are designed to move products to retailers like you!

Necessary ID for trade shows and marts
Professional trade shows and marts are not
open to the general public, and they want to
keep it that way. When you attend these
venues, they want to be sure that you repre-
sent a business. Following is a list of items that
you may be asked to provide as proof that you
are a retailer:
 Business cards
 A copy of your current resale tax certificate
or state tax permit
 Current occupational or business tax
license
 Proof of a business checking account or a
letter of credit from your bank (if applying
for credit)
 Financial statement
 Cash and checks
Be sure to check with the organization spon-
soring the trade show or mart before attending
so that you’ll have everything you need. Don’t
let this list scare you — wholesale marts are
fun and the organizers and vendors will do
everything they can to help you make your
retailing venture a success!

Few trade shows are more exciting than the Consumer Electronics Show
(CES), sponsored by the Consumer Electronics Association. If you buy break-
through technologies to sell online, this show is a must! You’ll find the latest
in everything high-tech, including digital imaging, electronic gaming, home
electronics, car audio, home theater, and satellite systems. You’ll see what’s
new, but more importantly, you’ll see what will be passé in a hurry — great
merchandise to sell on eBay!
CES draws more than 100,000 buyers each year, and the vendors are there to
sell their goods to you. Visit the CES Web site at www.cesweb.org to get an
idea of the excitement that the show generates.
See whether the item is selling on eBay before you make your purchase.
Bring a laptop and conduct research either on the spot or later in the day for
next-day purchases. Getting a good deal is one thing — selling it on eBay is
another.
Buying Online for Resale
I’ve come across many legitimate sources of goods on the Internet. But the
Internet is loaded with scam artists; it’s up to you to check vendors out for
yourself before spending your hard-earned money. Even if I mention sellers
here, I want you to check them out as if you know nothing about them. I
can’t guarantee a thing; all I know is that at the time of writing, they were
reliable sources for eBay merchandise.
Tips for buying wholesale online
Because the online world can be fraught with
problems, keep in mind the following:
 Protect your e-mail address. Check every
site you sign up with for a privacy policy.
Watch out for wording like this in the
Privacy Policy: ''Our Privacy Policy does
not extend to our affiliated sellers or adver-
tisers. They are free to maintain their own
privacy policy independent of us.'' Again,
get an anonymous e-mail address to spare
yourself spam.
 Look for the About Us page. Be sure the
site has an address and a phone number.
Call the number to see whether it is a “real”
business, not a fly-by-night. While you’re at
it, see how you’re treated on the phone.
 Look for safety seals. Seeing the Better
Business Bureau Online, TrustE, or
SquareTrade logo on the Web site can bol-
ster trust in the company.
 Check out the shipping costs. Sometimes
the shipping can cost more than the item.
Before placing your order, make sure you
know all the shipping costs and terms.

You must have a Federal tax ID number (that’s your identification to do busi-
ness) to even register on most legitimate wholesale sites. Finding wholesale
Web sites with this restriction is a good thing. It’s another way to verify that
you’re dealing with a true wholesale supplier.
B2B wholesale clearinghouses
Legitimate online sites for retailers are rare. Many of the business to business
(B2B) merchants and wholesale directories reflect nothing but flea market
goods and highly marked-up drop-shipping items. Don’t be disappointed!
That doesn’t mean you can’t find a deal on some great merchandise. The ben-
efit of the Internet is that you have access to many sources. The challenge is
to find the good, solid, reliable sources of information, like the following:
✦MadeInUSA.com: One of the best ways to find an item to sell is to find
that item in your everyday life. If you have the manufacturer’s name but
no contact information, go to the MadeInUSA Web site (see Figure 2-6),
which has a huge database of manufacturer contact info.
✦Greatrep.com: Here’s a Web site directory where buyers (that’s you)
can hook up with manufacturer’s representatives that carry lines of 
merchandise in the wholesale giftware, home furnishings, and furniture
industries. It’s fantastic! After you register (and provide your state resale
license), you have access to their listings of thousands of manufacturers.
In the listings you may find out how much they require for a minimum
order and you can request a catalog.

Buying directly from wholesalers 
Following are a few sources that have some unusual merchandise. I’ve bought
from almost all of them.
Luxury Brands LLC
Purchasing designer goods from the manufacturers is a rarity. Burberry and
Gucci aren’t the least bit interested in the piddly $1000 I might scrape together
to invest in their merchandise. If you’re looking for a legitimate wholesaler of
authentic designer goods that sells surplus designer goods in small lots for
individual resale on eBay, such a creature does exist: Luxury Brands, LLC
has worked out this unique niche in the market. You can find its Web site at
www.luxurybrandsllc.com.
Liquidation.com
If you like auctions (and I know you do) check out Liquidation.com. This is
a massive all-auction Web site that has incredible deals on all types of mer-
chandise, as shown in Figure 2-7.
One of the things that I love about this site is that most individual auctions
provide a link to the manifest — a list of every piece of merchandise in the
lot. If you click the View Manifest link at the top of the auction page, you see
a piece-by-piece list of the items included in the lot you’re bidding on.

It’s best to buy from vendors closer to your geographic area because 
after you add the shipping fee, you might be paying too much for your lot.
Liquidation.com has a shipping calculator to help you know ahead of time
how much your shipping may be.
Oriental Trading Company
The Oriental Trading Company has been in business for a long time. I used
to buy from their catalog for school and charity affairs. This site offers every-
thing from crafts to costumes to party goods — and all priced perfectly for
resale on eBay. Use your practiced eye (and completed search) to ferret out
the unique items that will sell. Visit them at www.orientaltrading.com.
Big Lots Wholesale
If you’re familiar with the Big Lots stores scattered around the country, you
have an idea of what you can buy at biglotswholesale.com. A quick click
to their Web site showed me that they were loaded with great deals on every-
thing from health and beauty items to toys to lawn and garden tools. A seller’s
tax ID number is required to get pricing on this site.

C
onsignment sales are the up-and-coming way for you to help newbies
by selling their items on eBay. Lots of sellers do it, and several retail
locations base their business on it. You take property of the item from the
owner and sell it on eBay. You’re responsible for taking photos and marketing
the auction on eBay — for a fee. In addition to the money you earn selling
on consignment, you also get excellent experience for future auctions of
your own merchandise.
Getting Organized to Sell for Others
To set up your business for consignment sales, you should follow a few
guidelines:
1. Design a consignment agreement (a contract), and send it to the owners
of the merchandise before they send you their items. Doing so ensures
that all policies are set up in advance and that no questions will arise
after the transaction has begun.
2. Have the owners sign and give the agreement to you (the consignor)
along with the item.
3. Research the item based on past sales so that you can give the owners
an estimated range of what the item might sell for on eBay.
4. Photograph the item carefully (see Book V for some hints) and write a
thoughtful, selling description.
5. Handle all e-mail inquiries as though the item were your own; after all,
your fee is generally based on a percentage of the final sale.
Traditional auction houses handle consignment sales in a similar fashion.

Compete with the Trading Posts
Several chains have opened up across the country with retail locations accept-
ing merchandise from the general public. By becoming an official Trading
Assistant, you can compete with the big boys in your own area.
The best part is that if you’re running your eBay business out of your home,
from a garage, or from a low-rent industrial office, you’re a step ahead of the
big guys who have to pay high rents in fancy neighborhoods to get their
drop-in business. They also have to hire people who are familiar with run-
ning auctions on eBay — aren’t you already set up for that?
Don’t worry about the competition! You may hear about the many brick-and-
mortar eBay consignment stores that are opening up. As a matter of fact, a
company is selling franchises for this business for up to $15,000! You already
know how to sell on eBay, why would you need a franchise? Use your good
sense (and positive feedback) to build your own eBay consignment store.
Following are some of the chains that sell goods on eBay for consumers:
✦AuctionDrop, www.auctiondrop.com
✦QuikDrop, www.quikdrop.com
✦iSold It, www.i-soldit.com
✦NuMarkets, www.numarkets.com
✦Postnet.com, www.postnettrading.com
✦AuctionMills, www.auctionmills.com
These retail locations have a much higher cost of business than you do. They
need to be open for set hours a day and have several employees on duty at
all times. Many of these stores won’t accept an item worth less than $75.
There’s still a lot of profit left for you in the under $75 item.
As of this writing, AuctionDrop, charges 38% of the first $200, 30% of the next
$300, and 20% of the remaining amount. AuctionMills and QuikDrop both
charge 38% of the first $200, 30% for the next $300, and 20% of the remaining
amount over $500. Check out these sites regularly so you can keep up with
the competition in your own area.
What do you charge for all your work? I can’t give you a stock answer for
that one. Many sellers charge a flat fee for photographing, listing, and ship-
ping that ranges from $5 to $10 plus as much as a 30% commission on the
final auction total (to absorb eBay fees). Other sellers base their fees solely
on the final sale amount and charge on a sliding scale, beginning at 50% of the

total sale, less eBay and payment service fees. You must decide how much
you think you can make on an item.
Table 3-1 will give you some ideas based on the input I’ve received from some
successful eBay consignment sellers. (These percentages may be in addition
to the listing fee and gallery charges.)

Becoming an eBay Trading Assistant
What is an eBay Trading Assistant? Simply put, an eBay Trading Assistant
sells merchandise for people on eBay. A more complex definition is that a
Trading Assistant sells items on consignment for those who are not familiar
with the eBay site or simply don’t want to bother to learn the ropes.
The first thing to take into consideration before becoming a Trading Assistant
is to be sure you are familiar with the eBay site and its rules and regulations
and — most of all — are experienced in selling items at a profit. To be a suc-
cessful Trading Assistant, you need to know how to research items on eBay
and how to parlay keywords into winning auction titles.
The Trading Assistants Directory appears on the eBay site at
www.eBay.com/tradingassistants
From the directory page (see Figure 3-1), potential customers can search for
a Trading Assistant to sell their items by postal zip code, telephone area code,
or country.

Becoming an eBay Trading Assistant
418
The Trading Assistants Directory page is promoted on the eBay site to new
users and in eBay promotions. Being listed on this page will help your cus-
tomers find you.
eBay makes it very clear that whether you fulfill the requirements for Trading
Assistant or not, being a Trading Assistant is a privilege. If eBay receives
complaints about your services, they have the right to remove you from the
Trading Assistant directory. Following are eBay’s requirements:
✦Listings: You must have sold at least four items in the last 30 days.
✦Feedback rating: You must have a minimum rating of 50 or higher, while
maintaining a minimum of 97% positive comments.
✦Activity: You must continue to sell at least one item every 30 days.
As a Trading Assistant, you acquire merchandise and sell it on eBay on con-
signment. You will also be responsible for the following:
✦Consulting with consignors about their items.
✦Researching the value of the item. Many non-eBay users may have unrea-
sonable expectations of the price their items will sell for. It’s your duty
to check this out beforehand and explain the realities to them.
Figure 3-1:

✦Coordinating the listing. Take digital photos and write a complete and
accurate description of the item.
✦Keeping a close accounting of fees and money collection.
That’s not much in the way of requirements, so get ready to become a TA.
Becoming a Trading Assistant does not make you an employee, agent, or
independent contractor of eBay. Make sure you refer to yourself as an inde-
pendent business.
When you sign up as a Trading Assistant, you have to fill out a form describ-
ing your business to prospective customers. Think through the things you
have to say, before posting them. Your information here works like an ad for
you. Following are the items to put on your Trading Assistant listing page:
✦Personal information: This includes your eBay user ID, your real name
and address, and the languages spoken. Your personal information
appears in the listing, such as the one from the professional Trading
Assistant, borntodeal, in Figure 3-2.
✦Category specialty: If you specialize in a particular category, be sure to
mention it. You may indicate eBay home page categories.
✦Service description: In this area you can say as little or as much as you
like about your eBay experience and the services you provide. Remember
that the more you communicate in advance, the more successful you’ll be.
Here is a sample service description (also look at borntodeal’s Specialties
and Services in Figure 3-3):
I’ve been active on the site since 1996 and am an eBay PowerSeller. I
specialize in selling all types of eBay items and am particularly famil-
iar with the fashion category. I can handle large numbers of listings.
Please contact me so that we can discuss your particular needs and
time availability.

I can visit your home within 15 miles from my place of business to
inventory the items. I will list, ship, and provide you with an itemized
list of all items sold with the sale price and my fees.
✦Policy description: Ensure that the consignees understand your poli-
cies. A sample description follows:
I will list your items for two listing cycles, spread up to 30 days. If items
do not sell, they will be returned to you. Items must be in my posses-
sion to be submitted to eBay unless contractual arrangements are
made in advance. I handle all correspondence and shipping. A consign-
ment contract is required. I also do independent consulting specializing
in Internet auctions and their application to your business.
✦Fee description: This is where you need to do some research. Search
your zip code on the Trading Assistants Directory page and see what
other fees are being charged in your area. After you have an idea of what
you want to charge, you can put that information here.
Take a look at borntodeal’s descriptions in Figure 3-4. There’s no question
about how this seller handles his business once you read this text. See if you
can come up with text that will sell your services without being overbearing.
You can provide incentives for higher-value items by charging lower commis-
sions (such as 40% if the item sells for less than $50, but 30% if the item sells
for more). Also, charging a higher percentage and including fees allows an
easier fee discussion with the client (for example, 40% and all fees included
versus 30% and you pay all the fees, which include . . . ).

Many Trading Assistants also quote transaction fees for listing with a reserve
(knowing it probably won’t sell because the consignor doesn’t have a fair
guess at the market valuation).
When you’ve decided everything you need to list, click the Create/Edit Your
Profile link on the Trading Assistant home page (mentioned at the beginning
of this chapter). Fill out the forms and, just like magic, you’ve become a
Trading Assistant!
Promoting Your Business
When I was working in the newspaper advertising business, we had a saying
about someone who opened a new store: If all the advertising they do is
their Grand Opening ad and nothing after, it won’t be long before you’ll be
seeing the Going-Out-of-Business sale ad. The same is true with your Trading
Assistant business.
eBay gives you many tools to help your consignment business, including a
co-op advertising program. For more information on co-op advertising, visit
Book VI.
Adding the Trading Assistant logo to your listings
Your best customers may come from people who see your existing items when
browsing eBay. Why not show all viewers that you’re a Trading Assistant by
including the Trading Assistant logo in your listings. When prospective cus-
tomers click the link, as shown in Figure 3-5, they’ll be sent to your Trading
Assistant Information page (just as if they searched for you in the directory).

Promoting Your Business
422
Add the Trading Assistant logo when your regular eBay business is slow, and
take it out when you’re overly busy. That way, you can control the amount of
work you have.
To add the link to your listings, you have to use a little HTML. Don’t panic.
It’s easy. First you need to find your Trading Assistant number (this is also
your eBay account number). Go to your listing in the directory. Look at the
top of your Internet browser, and you’ll see your Trading Assistant number
at the end of that Web page’s URL. The Web address will look like this:
http://contact.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?TradingAssistant&page=profile&profileId=
000000
where 000000 represents your number.
Then add the following HTML code at the end of your listing description,
replacing 000000 with your eBay number:
<center>
<a href=”http://
contact.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?TradingAssistant&page=profile&profileId=000000”
>
<b>I am a Trading Assistant - I can sell items for you!</b>

<img src=”http://pics.ebaystatic.com/aw/pics/tradingAssistant/imgTA_88x33.gif”
vspace=”5” border=”0” height=”33” width=”88”></a>
<br>
That’s all. Now the link and button shown in Figure 3-5 appear in your eBay
listings.
Posting flyers
Why not design a flyer that you print on your own printer. Put it up at the
supermarket, the car wash, the cleaner — anywhere and everywhere flyers
are allowed.
Even if you don’t see flyers in a retail location, ask the owner of the business
if you can put one up — maybe even offer a discount to the business owner
for selling their items on eBay in exchange!

Handling Your Business Professionally
How you conduct your business can demonstrate to your customers that
you’re a responsible person. You need to present a professional appearance
when you meet your client, and you should have a professional attitude in
your dealings.
Being professional also means anticipating possible problems. In addition 
to being very clear about financial issues with your clients (especially fees
and the realistic selling value of your clients’ merchandise), you may want

to consider getting additional insurance to cover the merchandise you’re
holding in your home.
You may also want to consider designing a few forms to reinforce with your
clients that this is your business and that you know it well. For example:
✦Inventory form: This form lists the entire inventory you receive from the
client and should include as detailed a description of the item as your
client can supply. Also, include the minimum amount (if any) the client
will accept for the item — this will be your reserve price if necessary.
✦Sales agreement: Professional Trading Assistants have their clients sign
a sales contract. Read on for some good suggestions about what to put
in your contract. You may want to have a lawyer look at your contract
before you use it.
The following information was graciously supplied by one of eBay’s success-
ful Trading Assistants, LikePhate (Kate and Phil Bowyer). It includes quotes
from their own Trading Assistant contract that cover many things that you
might overlook when you put together your own contract. This, of course, is
not a full agreement, but it provides some of the salient points.
Be sure to include an explanation of the consignment process:
✦The Consignor will bring item(s) to the Seller, who, upon both parties
signing this contract, will take possession of the items for the duration
of the auction.
✦Acceptance of any item consigned will be at the Seller’s sole discretion.
✦The Seller will inspect the item(s) for quality and clean if necessary 
(a fee may apply).
✦The Seller will take quality photographs and write an accurate descrip-
tion of item(s).
✦The Seller will research eBay for similar items to assure proper pricing.
✦The Seller will start the auction(s) and handle all aspects of the sale
including correspondence with bidders.
✦The Seller will collect payment from the winning bidder (“Buyer”) at the
end of the auction and will ship the item(s) in a timely manner, once funds
have cleared.
✦The Seller will follow up the sale by contacting the Buyer to make sure
they are satisfied with the transaction.
✦Once the Seller and Buyer are satisfied with the transaction, payment will
be made to the Consignor.

Book IV
Chapter 3

425
✦The Seller will keep the Consignor aware of the auction progress by tele-
phone or e-mail and by supplying the Consignor the auction number(s)
to track the item(s) themselves.
✦The Seller will return unsold item(s) to the Consignor upon payment of
outstanding fees.
It’s also a good idea to provide the consignor with a statement of items sold,
summarizing the total purchase price, all fees, and the amount the consignor
receives.
✦Outline your fees: “The Consignor will be billed the actual rates and
fees as incurred for all services, to include the Seller’s 00% Commission.
Any services or upgrades requested by the Consignor will carry the
exact fee and will be deducted from payment, or after three (3) failed
auction listings, will be due to the Seller payable in cash. If the auction
sells, these fees will be subtracted from the winning bid before the
Consignor receives payment.”
Be sure to include a copy of current eBay fees: listing, options, reserves,
PayPal, and final value fees.
✦Outline the terms of your commission: “The Seller’s commission for this
service is a percentage based on the auction’s winning bid. If the auction
does not sell, the Consignor is only responsible to pay the applicable
insertion and reserve price auction fees. An Unsold Reserve fee of $0.00
will be due to The Seller for a reserve price auction that does not sell.”
✦Be sure you don’t guarantee the item will sell. “If an item does not sell,
the Seller will re-list it two additional times. The Seller may contact the
Consignor to discuss combining individual items into lots to attract
buyers. The Consignor’s verbal consent, or e-mail consent, will be docu-
mented in the Consignor’s file and will serve as a revision to this contract.
After a third unsuccessful listing, the Consignor will be billed for the fees
associated with all three auctions, plus a $5.00 surcharge. Items will be
returned to the Consignor upon payment of those fees. Items not claimed
within 14 days from the end of the final listing will become the property
of the Seller.”
✦Protect yourself and your eBay reputation: “The Consignor of said
item(s) consents to the sale of said item(s) based on the terms described
in this agreement. The Consignor also attests that said item(s) are fully
owned by the Consignor and are not stolen, borrowed, misrepresented,
bogus, etc.”
You might also mention that you will only sell the item if eBay policies
allow the item to be sold.

Handling Your Business Professionally
426
“The Seller will do everything possible to secure the safety of the
Consignor’s item(s), however, the Seller is not responsible for any damage
to the item, including fire, theft, flood, accidental damage or breakage,
and acts of God. The Consignor releases the Seller of any such responsi-
bility for any unforeseen or accidental damage.”
I choose to protect myself additionally, because reputation on eBay is
paramount. I have a small business rider on my homeowner’s insurance
that covers merchandise in my home up to $5,000. It’s an inexpensive
addition to your policy — definitely worth looking into.
✦Ending a sale prematurely: “If such an instance arises that the Consignor
demands the item(s) to be pulled, the Consignor will pay a cancellation
fee of $75. Items will not be surrendered to the Consignor until this fee is
paid in cash.”
✦Protect yourself from possible shill bidding: An important line you
should add protects you from possible shill bidding. How about: The
Consignor also agrees not to place a bid on an auction that the Seller has
listed for the Consignor (hereafter “Shill Bid”) on eBay, nor to arrange
for a Shill Bid to be made on the behalf of the Consignor by a third party.
If the Consignor or an agent of the Consignor submits a Shill Bid on an
auction listed by the Seller, the Consignor agrees to pay all fees, commis-
sions, and penalties associated with that auction, plus a $75.00 fine, and
the Seller may refuse to grant auction services to the Consignor in the
future.
Again, I strongly suggest that you get professional advice before putting
together your own contract or agreement.

and Drop-Shipping
In This Chapter
 Speaking like a merchandiser
 Understanding the different types of salvage
 Practicing safe shopping
 Drop-shipping without drop-kicking your customers
You’re likely to find various levels of quality when you look for merchan-
dise to resell on eBay. Receiving a box of ripped or stained goods when
you expected first-quality merchandise can be disheartening. If you take the
time to evaluate the condition of the merchandise you’re interested in buying,
you save time (and money) in the long run. But to make that evaluation, you
need to know what the industry language tells you about the quality of the
merchandise. 
In addition to qualifying the goods you buy, take the time to qualify the
processes and partners you use. For example, drop-shipping (shipping goods
straight from the stockpile to the consumer) has become a popular method
for moving merchandise sold on eBay, but it comes with many caveats. For
example, eBay has a policy about preselling items, so be sure to check it 
out — and make sure your drop-shipper has the merchandise ready to go
when you place your order. Use this chapter to become a savvy buyer of
goods to resell and an effective mover of those same goods. 
Know the Lingo of Merchandisers
To help ensure that industry jargon won’t trip you up, this section describes
the lingo you need to know and offers pointers on making the right decisions
about your merchandise and methods. Here are some terms you’re likely to
come across:
✦Job lots: A job lot simply refers to a bunch of merchandise sold at 
once. The goods may consist of unusual sizes, odd colors, or even some
hideous stuff that won’t blow out of your eBay store if a hurricane came

428
in. Some of the merchandise (usually no more than 15%) may be dam-
aged. Super discounts can be had on job lots — and if the lot contains
brand names from major stores, you may be able to make an excellent
profit.
A good way to find a jobber (someone who wants to sell you job lots) on the
Internet is to run a Google search on wholesale jobber. Another great place
to find a jobber is in the phone book or industry newsletter classifieds.
✦Off-price lots: If you can get hold of top-quality, brand-name items in off-
price lots, you can do very well on eBay. These items are end-of-season
overruns (more items were made than could be sold through normal
retailers). You can generally find this merchandise toward the end of the
buying season.
Many eBay sellers, without having the thousands of dollars to buy mer-
chandise, make friends with the salespeople at manufacturers’ outlet
stores (where the merchandise may land first). Others haunt places like
TJ Maxx, Marshall’s, and Burlington Coat Factory for first-rate deals.
Search the classified ads of genuine trade publications for items to buy
in bulk. Publications such as California Apparel News have classifieds
that are accessible online for a small fee. Visit their Web site at www.
apparelnews.net and click Classifieds (see Figure 4-1). You can pay to
view current classified ads through PayPal; as of this writing, the cost is
only $2.

✦Liquidations: All eBay sellers think of liquidations as the mother lode of
deals. And, yes, they may be the mother lode of deals if you can afford to
buy and store an entire 18-wheeler truckload of merchandise. That takes
a great deal of money and a great deal of square footage, plus the staff to
go through each and every item.
Getting the 411 on refurbished goods
You can find great deals on refurbished elec-
tronic merchandise on eBay. Unfortunately,
refurbished merchandise gets an unnecessar-
ily bad rap. Very smart people may tell you to 
be wary of refurbished merchandise. Great
advice . . . I guess. I tell people to be wary of all
merchandise. 
The way I figure it, refurbished merchan-
dised has been gone over by the manufacturer
twice — new merchandise has been gone over
only once! I buy refurbished merchandise all
the time. Let me explain what refurbished mer-
chandise is and why it can be such a bargain.
Refurbished merchandise can fall into one of
these categories:
 Canceled orders: This is merchandise in
perfectly good shape. Say a customer
makes a special order and then changes
his or her mind, or the order is somehow
mucked up (“I ordered a PC. You sent me a
Mac!”). Something has to be done with the
merchandise. Enter you, the savvy shopper.
 Evaluation units: An evaluation unit is a
piece of equipment that is sent to a member
of the media or to a corporation for testing
or review. Evaluation units must be returned
to the manufacturer, and the manufacturer
may decide to unload them.
 Store returns: This is probably pretty obvi-
ous to you, right? Joe Customer buys some-
thing in a store, takes it home, and opens it,
only to decide that he doesn’t really want it.
By law, as soon as the box is opened, a
piece of merchandise can never be sold as
new again, even if the merchandise was
never used.
 Defective units: This is a piece of mer-
chandise deemed defective by either the
store or by the user and returned to the
manufacturer.
 Overstocks: When a manufacturer comes
out with a new model, they may take back
the older models from retailers in an effort
to encourage them to stock more of the
newer, faster, cooler model.
Whenever an item is returned to the manufac-
turer for any reason and the original box has
been opened, the item (whether it’s a television,
a computer, a camera, or some other technical
device), must be reconditioned to the manu-
facturer’s original quality standards. Any non-
functioning parts are replaced with functioning
components and the item is repackaged. The
manufacturer usually gives refurbished items a
90-day warranty.
When buying refurbished goods, be sure the
original manufacturer was the one doing the
reconditioning. I’m sure that some technical
geeks can fix things just fine in their garage, but
you don’t have the same level of protection (as
in, you don’t have a warranty from a reliable
source) if you buy a piece of equipment that
wasn’t fixed by the manufacturer.

Salvage: Liquidation Items, Unclaimed Freight, and Returns
430
The merchandise can be an assortment of liquidations, store returns,
salvage, closeouts, shelf pulls, overstocks, and surplus goods. Some
items may be damaged but repairable; others may be perfectly salable.
As much as 30% or more of a truckload may be useless. Buying liquida-
tion merchandise is a gamble but can have advantages. By buying a full
truckload, you have a wide breadth of merchandise, you pay the lowest
amount for it, and some of it may be good for spare parts.
Save yourself some money. Don’t go on eBay and buy some wholesale list
for $5. You can get the same names by running a Google search on the term
wholesale. Every true wholesaler Web site has a dealer login page, so try
searching for dealer login along with a category name, such as dealer login
jewelry.
Salvage: Liquidation Items, Unclaimed 
Freight, and Returns
The easiest to buy for resale, salvage merchandise is retail merchandise that
has been returned, exchanged, or shelf-pulled for some reason. Salvage can
also encompass liquidation merchandise and unclaimed freight. Generally,
this merchandise is sold as-is and where-is and may be in new condition.
To buy this merchandise directly from the liquidator in large lots, you must
have your resale (sales tax number) permit and be prepared to pay the ship-
ping to your location.
Several types of salvage merchandise are available:
✦Unclaimed freight: When a trucking company delivers merchandise, a
manifest accompanies the freight. If, for some reason, a portion of the
shipment arrives incomplete, contains the wrong items, or is damaged,
the entire shipment may be refused by the merchant. The trucking com-
pany is now stuck with as much as a truckload of freight. The original
seller may not want to pay the freight charges to return the merchandise
to his or her warehouse (or accept blame for an incorrect shipment), 
so the freight becomes the trucker’s problem. The trucking companies
arrive at agreements with liquidators to buy this freight in the various
areas that the liquidators serve. This way, truckers are never far from a
location where they can dump, er, drop off merchandise.
✦Returns: Did you know that when you return something to a store or
mail-order house, it can never be sold as new again (in most states
anyway)? The merchandise is generally sent to a liquidator who agrees
in advance to pay a flat percentage for goods. The liquidator must move
the merchandise to someone else. All major retailers liquidate returns,
and much of this merchandise ends up on eBay or in closeout stores.

Chapter 4
Liquidation and
Drop-Shipping
Salvage: Liquidation Items, Unclaimed Freight, and Returns
431
If you’re handy at repairing electronics or computers, you’d probably do
very well with a specialized lot. You may easily be able to revitalize dam-
aged merchandise, often using parts from two unsalable items to come
up with one that you can sell in like-new working condition.
✦Liquidations: Liquidators buy liquidation merchandise by truckloads
and sell it in smaller lots. The merchandise comes from financially
stressed or bankrupt companies that need to raise cash quickly.
The liquidation business has been thriving as a well-kept secret for years.
As long as you have space to store salvage merchandise and a way to
sell it, you can acquire it for as low as ten cents on the dollar. When I 
say you need storage space, I mean lots of space. To buy this type of
merchandise at bottom-of-the-barrel prices, you must be willing to
accept truckloads — full 18 wheelers, loaded with more than 20 pallets
(4 feet x 4 feet x 6 or 7 feet) — of merchandise at a time. Often these
truckloads have manifests (a document containing the contents of the
shipment) listing the retail and wholesale price of each item on the truck.
If you have access to the more than 10,000 square feet of warehouse that
you’ll need to unpack and process this amount of merchandise, you’re in
business.
✦Seasonal overstocks: My motto is “Buy off-season, sell on-season.” At
the end of the season, a store may find its shelves overloaded with sea-
sonal merchandise (such as swimsuits in August) that it must get rid 
of to make room for the next season’s stock. These brand-new items
become salvage merchandise because they’re seasonal overstocks.
✦Shelf-pulls: Have you ever passed up one item in the store for the one
behind it in the display because its box was in better condition? Some-
times the plastic bubble or the package is dented, and you’d rather have
a pristine one. That box you just passed up may be destined to become
a shelf-pull. The item inside may be in perfect condition, but it’s cosmeti-
cally unsalable in the retail store environment.
A proportion of liquidation items, unclaimed freight, and returns may be
unsalable. Although you’ll acquire many gems that stand to bring you profit,
you’ll also be left with a varying percentage of useless items.
Some liquidation sellers sell their merchandise in the same condition that it
ships in to their location, so what you get is a crapshoot. You may lose money
on some items while making back your money on others. Other sellers who
charge a bit more will remove less desirable merchandise from the pallets.
Some may even make up deluxe pallets with better-quality merchandise.
These loads cost more, but if they’re filled with the type of merchandise that
you’re interested in selling, you’ll probably write better descriptions and
subsequently do a better job selling them.

Before you glaze over and get dazzled by a low, low price on a lot, check the
shipping cost to you before you buy. Many so-called wholesalers will lure you
in with bargain-basement prices, only to charge you three times the normal
shipping costs. Do your homework before you buy!
Buying liquidation merchandise on eBay 
Liquidation merchandise can be new, used, or
trashed. Searching through a liquidator’s eBay
auctions is like digging through the “Final Sale”
bin at a store, where prices are marked down
to absurd levels. 
Liquidators buy merchandise from companies
that are in financial distress and need to raise
cash quickly. The kinds of issues companies
face can vary — the why isn’t important. All you
need to know is that you can get access to
some astonishing deals because some of it is
sold in lots on eBay. 
Merchandise arrives by the truckload. From
there the merchandise is unloaded, inspected,
and sorted — and then the fun begins. Some of
the merchandise can be put together in whole-
sale lots (the goods are grouped by the pallet
or by the case and sold to wholesalers or retail-
ers), and some of the merchandise may be put
aside to be sold to sellers for resale on eBay.
Buying items from liquidators can be a risky
enterprise. There’s no warranty, and no one you
can complain to if something is wrong with the
item. All items are always sold as is and where
is. Essentially, what you see is what you get; if
it works, it’s a bonus. 
Here are some tips for buying this type of item:
 Look for sealed in the box: Look at the pic-
ture and read the description carefully. If
the description states that the item is
sealed in the manufacturers packaging,
you have a pretty good chance that the item
is in new condition.
 Don’t spend a bundle: This kind of goes
without saying, right? It’s supposed to be a
bargain.
One of my favorite liquidators on eBay is
Bargainland-Liquidation, which operates out of
a 100,000-square foot facility in Phoenix and
other facilities in Florida and Mississippi.
Bargainland does take hits with negative feed-
back. People are often unhappy when their
dice shoot turns up snake eyes. I’ve bought
from them as well, and have carefully steered
clear of anything that wasn’t a fairly safe bet. I
also follow my own advice and rarely buy an
item from Bargainland that isn’t new in the
manufacturer’s box — or cheap enough to
gamble with. 
But remember, there’s always a risk. On
Bargainland-Liquidation’s About Me page, they
state their policy, a portion of which is shown
here:
“We are not able to compensate customers for
any discrepancies in product. We will, how-
ever, assure the customer that they will get the
EXACT merchandise that they see in the photo
regardless of the description. Please keep in
mind that liquidation is not for everyone. 
Bargainland does not offer any refunds, war-
ranties or returns of any kind for any reason.
The only reason you will ever be given a refund
by our company is if you did not receive the
product shown in the photograph. Please con-
sider this carefully before you buy.”

Staying Safe When Buying Online
Nobody offers a quality or fitness guarantee when you buy liquidation mer-
chandise. You could end up with pallets of unsalable merchandise, and you
must steer quickly away from anyone who guarantees that you’ll make money.
Remember that liquidation merchandise is always sold as-is.
When buying online, it’s hard to know about the company you’re dealing
with because you’ve probably just found them after performing a Web search.
When you find a source from which you want to buy merchandise by the
pallet, check out a few things before spending your hard-earned cash:
✦Get an anonymous free e-mail address from Yahoo! before signing up
for any mailing lists or newsletters. Some Web sites that offer these
publications make most of their money by selling your e-mail address to
spammers. If you give them an anonymous e-mail address, the buckets
of spam will never end up in your real mailbox. (I learned about that the
hard way.)
✦Raise your shields if the wholesalers also link their Web sites to mis-
cellaneous make-big-profits-on-eBay Web sites. They may be making
most of their money from commissions when the e-book of “road-to-riches
secret tips” is sold to you.
✦Be sure the site has a phone number. Give them a call and see how
you’re treated. It’s no guarantee of how they’ll treat you if you’re unhappy
with a purchase, but you may get a human being on the phone (rare and
precious these days).
✦Look for a physical address. Do they have a place of business or is the
company running out of some guy’s pocket cell phone? (Often it’s not a
good sign if there’s no place to hang a sign.)
✦Ask for references. Seeing the Better Business Bureau Online, TrustE,
or SquareTrade logo on the Web site can bolster trust in the company.
(They have to qualify for those seals.)
✦Before you purchase anything, go to eBay and see whether that item
will sell — and for how much. Often you find hundreds of listings for an
item with no bids. Check completed auctions and be sure that the item
is selling for a solid profit over what you expect to pay for it (including
shipping).
✦Never buy anything just because it’s cheap. That was true in Thomas
Jefferson’s day and is still true today. Be sure you can actually sell the
merchandise. (I also learned this the hard way.)
✦Guarantee: Does the source guarantee that you will make money or that
you can make money by buying the right merchandise? Remember that
no one can guarantee that you’ll make money.

Dealing with Drop-Shippers
434
✦References: Does the supplier offer on its Web site references that you
can contact to find out some usable information on this seller’s items
and the percentage of unsalable goods in a box or pallet?
✦Look for FOB. That means freight on board. You will be charged freight
from the location of the merchandise to your door. The shorter the dis-
tance, the cheaper your freight costs.
Before doing business on any Web site, be sure its owners have a privacy
policy that protects your personal information. Also check for an About Us
page and make sure the page talks about the business and the people behind
it. I hate to be repetitive, but be sure you can reach a human being on a phone
or in person (with a street address) if need be.
Dealing with Drop-Shippers
A drop-shipper is a business that stocks merchandise, sells the merchandise
to you (the reseller), but ships it directly to your customer. By using a drop-
shipper, you transfer the risks of buying, storing, and shipping merchandise
to another party. You become a stockless retailer with no inventory hanging
around — often an economical, cost-effective way to do business.
The following steps outline the standard way to work with most drop-shippers
on eBay:
1. Sign up on the drop-shipper’s Web site to sell their merchandise on eBay
or in your Web store. Check out their terms before you sign up to be sure
there’s no minimum purchase.
2. Select the items from their inventory that you want to sell. The supplier
gives you descriptive copy and photographs to help make your sales job
easier.
3. Post the item online and wait (fidgeting with anticipation) for someone
to buy it.
4. As soon as your buyer pays you for the item, e-mail the drop-shipper
(or fill out a special secure form on their Web site) and pay for the item
with your credit card or PayPal.
5. Relax while the drop-shipper ships the item to your customer for you.
6. If all goes well, the item arrives quickly and safely.
You make a profit and get some positive feedback.

Book IV
Chapter 4
Liquidation and
Drop-Shipping
Dealing with Drop-Shippers
435
The drop-shipper’s Web site provides you with descriptions and images.
Fine. But you and everybody else who sells that item on eBay will have the
same photos and descriptive copy. Do yourself a favor and get a sample of
your item, take your own pictures, and write your own description. Then 
at least you have a chance at beating the competitive sameness on eBay.
Drop-shipping works especially well for Web-based retail operations. Web
stores can link directly to the drop-shipper to transmit shipping and pay-
ment information. When you’re selling on eBay, it’s another thing. There’s
more competition and you can’t list hundreds of items at no additional cost.
Listing items on eBay costs money and may build up your expenses before
you make a profit. You can’t just select an item from a drop-shipper and
throw hundreds of auctions on eBay without losing money. That is, unless
your item is selling like gangbusters at an enormous profit. If that were the
case, believe me, there would be another eBay seller buying directly from
the manufacturer and undercutting your price.
I must interject that I bought (for research) several drop-shipper lists from
eBay sellers. I am saddened to report that I couldn’t find any that fulfilled 
my security requirements for doing business with an unknown business
online. The drop-shippers whose merchandise I could track had a penchant
Drop-shipping to your customers
Some middlemen, wholesalers, and liquidators
specialize in selling to online auctioneers
through a drop-ship service. Some crafty eBay
sellers make lots of money selling lists of drop-
shipping sources to eBay sellers — I hope not
to you. Dealing with a drop-shipper means that
you don’t ever have to take possession of (or
pay for) the merchandise. You’re given a photo
and, after you sell the item, you give the vendor
the address of the buyer. They charge your
credit card for the item plus shipping, and then
ship the item to your customer for you. 
This way of doing business costs you more and
lowers your profits. Your goal as a business
owner is to make as much money as you can.
Because the drop-shipper is in business too,
they’ll mark up the merchandise (and the ship-
ping cost) so they can make their profit. 
Be careful when using a drop-shipper. Ask for
references. See whether a zillion sellers are
selling the same merchandise on eBay — and
not getting any bites. Also, what happens if a
drop-shipper runs out of an item that you’ve just
sold? You can’t just say oops to your buyer
without getting some nasty feedback. It’s your
online reputation at stake. If you find a solid
source and believe in the product, order a
quantity and have it shipped to your door. Don’t
pay for someone else’s mark-up for the privi-
lege of having them ship to your customers.

Dealing with Drop-Shippers

for flooding the eBay market by selling the same item to too many sellers —
thereby driving down the price. I also found little brand-name merchandise
available. If any of my readers find a reputable drop-shipper who allows room
for profit on eBay, please e-mail me through my Web site. I think this is a
business that could work, but only if the right businesses were involved.
It’s one thing to sign up for a free newsletter — or even to register with a 
particular site — but it’s something else to have to pay to see what the drop-
shipper intends to offer you. You should not pay anything in advance to sign
up for a drop-shipping service.
Finding a good drop-shipper
Thousands of Web companies are aching to help you set up your online 
business. Some of them are good solid companies with legitimate back-
grounds, but others are just trying to get your money. These guys hope you
don’t know what you’re doing; they’re betting you’ll be desperate enough to
send them some cash to help you get your share of the (har har) “millions to
be made online.”
Consider the following when you’re choosing drop-shippers to work with:
✦Skepticism is healthy. When you come across Web sites that proclaim that
they can drop-ship thousands of different products for you, think twice.
Thousands? I don’t know many stores that carry thousands of items —
if they do, they have vast square footage for storage and hundreds
of thousands of dollars to invest in merchandise. Most drop-shipping
services don’t. A much smaller offering of merchandise may indicate
that the drop-shipper has the merchandise ready to ship and isn’t rely-
ing on ordering it from someone for you.
✦Look out for long lines of distribution. Drop-shippers are often middle-
men who broker merchandise from several sources — for example, from
other middlemen who buy from brokers (who in turn buy from manufac-
turers). The line of distribution can get even longer — which means that
a slew of people are making a profit from your item before you even buy
it “wholesale.” If even one other reseller gets the product directly from
the distributor or (heaven forbid) the manufacturer, that competitor can
easily beat your target selling price. Verify with the drop-shipper that
they stock the merchandise they sell.
Coping with the inevitable out-of-stock
What happens when you sell an item and you go to the distributor’s site 
and find that it’s sold out? Before your heart stops, call the drop-shipper.
Perhaps they still have one or two of your items around their warehouse and

took the item off the Web site because they’re running too low to guarantee
delivery.
If that isn’t the case, you’re going to have to contact your buyer and ’fess up
that the item is currently out of stock at your supplier. I suggest calling your
customers in this situation; they may not be as angry as they might be if you
just e-mail them. Offer to refund their money immediately. Somebody else’s
foul-up may net you bad feedback, but that risk goes along with using drop-
shipping as a business practice.

elcome to the cyberworld of imaging, where pictures aren’t called
pictures, but images. With a digital camera or a scanner and software,
you can manipulate your images — crop, color-correct, and add special
effects — so that they grab viewers by the lapels.
Sellers, take heed and read why you should use well-made digital images in
your auction pages:
✦If you don’t have a picture, potential bidders may wonder whether you’re
deliberately hiding the item from view because you know something is
wrong with it. Paranoid? Maybe. Practical? You bet.
✦Fickle bidders don’t even bother reading an item description if they
can’t see the item.
✦Taking your own pictures shows that you have the item in your posses-
sion. Many scam artists take images from a manufacturer’s Web site to
illustrate their bogus sales on eBay. Why risk being suspect? Snap a
quick picture!
✦Everyone’s doing it. I hate to pressure you, but digital images are the
custom on eBay, so if you’re not using them, you’re not reaching the
widest possible number of people who would bid on your item. From
that point of view, you’re not doing the most you can to serve your
potential customers’ needs. Hey, fads are driven by conformity. You may
as well use them to your advantage.
So which is better for capturing images: a digital camera or a digital scan-
ner? As with all gadgets, here’s the classic answer: It depends. For my
money, it’s hard to beat a digital camera. But before you go snag one, decide
what kind of investment (and how big) you plan to make in your eBay auc-
tions. If you’re already comfortable with 35mm camera equipment, don’t
scrap it — scan (or find a digital SLR — single lens reflex). The scoop on
both alternatives is coming right up.

Setting Up Your Studio
442
Setting Up Your Studio
Taking pictures for eBay? No problem! You have a digital camera, and you
know how to use it. Just snap away and upload that picture, right? Sorry, but
no. There’s a good way and a bad way to take photos for eBay and, believe it
or not, the professional way taught by many instructors isn’t necessarily the
best way.
I recommend that you set up a mini photo studio for your eBay auction pic-
tures. That way, you won’t have to clean off your kitchen counter every time
you want to take pictures.
If you must use the kitchen counter or a desktop, be sure to use an inexpen-
sive photo stage, which you can find on — where else — eBay.
You need several basic things in your photo studio; the extras you should
have are based on the type of merchandise you’re selling. An eBay generalist,
someone who sells almost anything online — like me! — should have quite a
few extras for taking quality photos. Check out a portion of my home photo
studio in Figure 1-1. This setup works well for small as well as large items.
Figure 1-1:

Alternatively, in Figure 1-2, I use a photo cube combined with either small
clamp lights (shown) or tall floodlights. A photo cube works well for finely
detailed and collectible objects — as well as any object that will fit in them.
By using a translucent fabric cube, you can fully illuminate your item and
have no glare, harsh shadows, or detail burnout!
Hands down, the equipment for photographing jewelry and teeny, tiny items
is the Cloud Dome (see “Other Studio Equipment” further on). It not only
helps with lighting, but also holds your camera steady for difficult super-
magnified (macro) shots.
What you find in this section might be more than you thought you’d need 
to produce good pictures. But your photographs can help sell your mer-
chandise, so you need to consider this part of your business seriously. Of
course, if you sell only one type of item, you won’t need such a varied selec-
tion of stuff, but you should have the basic photo setup. Check my Web site
(www.coolebaytools.com) for more ideas.
Your #1 Tool: A Digital Camera
Digital cameras are mysterious things. You may read about megapixels (a
million pixels) and think that more is supposed to be better, but that doesn’t
apply to eBay applications or to Web images. Megapixels measure the image
resolution that the camera is capable of recording. For online use, all you
need from a camera is 640 x 480 pixels (or, at the most, 800 x 600 pixels)
because computer monitors are incapable of taking advantage of more pixels.

Your #1 Tool: A Digital Camera

If you use a higher resolution picture, you’ll have a pixel-bloated picture that
takes a looooong time to load online.
The camera you use for eBay is a personal choice. Would-be big-time sellers
starting out in an eBay business (with no experience on the Internet) usually
go out and buy the most expensive digital camera they can find. Maybe having
lots of megapixels is a macho thing, but a camera with a bunch of megapixels
is the last thing you need for eBay images.
You don’t need a million pixels, but you do need the following:
✦Quality lens: I’m sure anyone who has worn glasses can tell the differ-
ence between a good lens and a cheap one. Really cheap cameras have
plastic lenses, and the quality of the resulting pictures is accordingly
lousy. Your camera will be your workhorse, so be sure to buy one from 
a company known for making quality products.
✦Removable media: Most cameras can connect to your PC with a USB
cable, and many sellers are happy with that type of connection. Others
find that taking their camera to the computer and using cables and extra
software to download pictures to the hard drive is annoying. Removable
media eliminates this annoyance. Here’s a starter list of removable stor-
age media:
• Floppy disks: Sony has a line of Mavica cameras that save images 
to a regular 31⁄2-inch floppy disk. After taking your pictures, you just
remove the floppy and put it in your A drive. Voila! The pictures are
in your computer. You can then copy the images to a directory on
your hard drive for cropping and uploading.
• CompactFlash memory card: This is a small medium, slightly smaller
than a matchbook. You insert it into a media reader to transfer the
data to your computer. CompactFlash cards come in different sizes
and hold from 16MB to 1GB.
• Secure digital card: The newest (and smallest) incarnation in mini
storage is the secure digital card. An amazing little piece of technol-
ogy in a postage-stamp size, it’s one of the most durable. The small
media is encased in plastic, as is the CompactFlash card and the
Memory Stick. It also uses metal connector contacts rather than pins
and plugs like other cards, making it less prone to damage. These
cards can be set to hold up to 512MB.
• SmartMedia cards: A SmartMedia card is slightly smaller than a
CompactFlash card, is very thin, and has no plastic outer case. It’s
used in only a few brands of digital cameras (such as Olympus).
SmartMedia cards come in different data sizes from 8MB to 128MB.
• Memory Stick: A tiny media card about the size of a piece of chewing
gum and as long as a AA battery, the Memory Stick is a Sony device
used in most Sony products. Memory Sticks now hold as much as

Book V
Chapter 1
Your eBay Photo
Studio
Your #1 Tool: A Digital Camera
445
2GB. One of the great things about a Memory Stick is that it can be
used in numerous devices besides cameras, including PCs and video
recorders.
• Mini CD, CD/RW, or DVD: These mini optical discs hold tons of pics
for eBay — 185MB worth. You can read them right in your computer’s
CD or DVD reader. Check out your disc platter, and you’ll notice a
smaller round indentation; that’s what holds the mini disc.
You insert these cards directly into your computer, if your computer has
ports for them. Or get an adapter that connects to your computer through
a USB or parallel port. You can get either type of reader on eBay for
about $30.
You may find that you use more than one type of medium with your digi-
tal camera. And because you can record any type of digital data on these
types of removable media, you may find other uses for them. For exam-
ple, sometimes when I want to back up files or move larger files and don’t
have access to my flash drive, I copy them onto one of my camera memory
cards in the reader on my desktop computer and then transfer the files
by plugging the card into the adapter on my laptop.
✦Optical zoom versus digital zoom: Two characteristics to keep in mind
when looking for a camera are convenience and optical zoom. Choose a
camera that is easy to use and has the accessories you want. Also, make
sure that the optical zoom capabilities will help you capture the level of
detail that your merchandise requires.
When shopping for your camera, find one with the highest optical zoom
that you can afford. Optical zoom is magnified by the camera’s lens (using
the camera’s internal optics), producing a vivid picture.
Digital zoom is valuable with a camcorder when shooting moving pic-
tures, because the eye can’t focus as easily as the camera on moving
results. When your camera uses digital zoom, it does the same thing as
enlarging a picture in photo-editing software. The camera centers the
focus over half the focal plane and uses software interpolation to enlarge
the picture. This makes your image slightly fuzzy.
✦Tripod mount: Have you ever had a camera hanging around your neck
while you’re trying to repackage some eBay merchandise that you’ve
just photographed? Or perhaps you’ve set down the camera for a minute
and then can’t find it? Avoid this hassle by using a tripod to hold your
camera. Tripods also help you avoid blurry pictures from shaking hands.
To use a tripod, you need a tripod mount, the little screw hole that you
see at the bottom of some cameras. Later in this chapter, I give you some
tips on finding the right tripod.
✦Macro setting capability or threading for a lens adapter: These fea-
tures will come in handy if you plan to photograph coins, jewelry, or
small detailed items. A camera’s macro setting enables you to get in

Your #1 Tool: A Digital Camera
446
really close to items while keeping them in focus. Usually the macro
mode can focus as close as 1 inch and as far away as 10 inches. A small
flower icon in the camera’s menu normally signifies the macro setting. A
threaded lens mount is an alternative that enables you to add different
types of lenses to the camera for macro focus or other uses.
The average camera’s focal length (focus range) is from 3 feet to infinity.
If you have a camera that says the macro focus range is set at 5.1 inches,
it means you can’t focus it clearly on an object any closer than 5.1 inches.
Macro pictures require a steady hand; any vibration can blur your image.
✦Battery life: When you’re choosing your camera, be sure to check into
the length of time the camera’s battery will hold a charge. The last thing
you want to do is run out of juice at the wrong moment. Consider the 
following:
• Look for a camera battery with at least three hours of photo-taking
time.
• Keep a spare battery on hand. I keep a Lithium CR-V3 battery (which
replaces two AA batteries) in my purse so I’ll be prepared if my
camera battery runs low while I’m on the road.
• Invest in a charger and rechargeable batteries. I have a rechargeable
backup battery for my Sony Mavica FD92 camera in the office. These
batteries last a long time and are worth the investment.
Cameras have presets for different focal ranges, and they’re usually set
in meters. (There’s an m following the focus range number.) Just so you
won’t forget, a meter is approximately 3 feet in distance.
✦White-balance setting: This is a tricky feature. Most eBay digital photog-
raphers set the camera to Auto (if there is a setting) and hope for the
best. If you can adjust the white balance, do so. Manufacturers use dif-
ferent presets. The list of options can include settings for incandescent
lights, twilight, fluorescent lights, outdoor, indoor, or shade. All these
lighting situations have different color temperatures. It’s worthwhile to
take the time to play with the various white-balance settings of your
camera in the different places where you normally photograph eBay
merchandise. Make notes on settings that give you the truest colors in
your digital images.
✦Autofocus and zoom: These options just make life easier when you want
to take pictures and should be standard features.
The bottom line is that you should buy a brand-name camera. I use a Sony
Mavica FD92 for eBay pictures. (I keep a Nikon CoolPix 3200 around as well.)
The Mavica is outdated, but it’s also loaded with all the bells and whistles I
need for eBay photos. It stores images on a Sony Memory Stick or on a floppy
disk, which I just pop out and insert in my computer. The camera’s storage
convenience makes the Mavica FD series a favorite of eBay sellers.

Scanning Your Wares
447
I bet you could find a camera that fits your needs right now on eBay for con-
siderably less than $150. Remember that many digital camera users buy the
newest camera available and sell their older, low-megapixel cameras on eBay
for a pittance. Many professional camera stores also sell used equipment.
Scanning Your Wares
Scanners have come a long way in the past few years. A once-expensive item
can now be purchased new for a little more than a $100. If you sell books,
autographs, stamps, or documents, a scanner may be all you need to shoot
your images for eBay.
When shopping for a scanner, don’t pay too much attention to the resolution.
Some scanners can provide resolutions as high as 12,800 dpi, which looks
awesome when you print the image. But to dress up your eBay auctions, all
you need is (are you ready?) 72 dpi! That’s it. Your images will look great
and won’t take up much storage space on your computer’s hard drive. Basic
scanners can scan images up to 1200 dpi, so even they are more powerful
than you need for your eBay images. As with digital cameras, you should
stick with a brand-name scanner.
You should use a flatbed scanner, on which you lay out your items and scan
away. I replaced my old scanner with an HP All-in-One, which is not only a
scanner but also a printer, a fax machine, and a color copier! These nifty
flatbed units are available new on eBay. I’ve seen HP models, new in box,
sell for as low as $100.
A few tips on scanning images for eBay:
✦If you’re taking traditionally processed photographs and scanning them,
print them on glossy paper because they’ll scan much better than those
with a matte finish.
✦You can scan 3-D items, such as a doll, on your flatbed scanner and get
some respectable-looking images. To eliminate harsh shadows, lay a
black or white T-shirt over the doll or her box so that it completely
covers the glass. This way, you will have a clean background and get
good light reflection from the scanner’s light.
✦If you want to scan an item that’s too big for your scanner’s glass, simply
scan the item in pieces, and then reassemble it to a single image in your
photo-editing program. The instructions that come with your software
should explain how to do this.
✦Boxed items are a natural for a flatbed scanner. Just set them on top of
the glass, and scan away. You can crop the shadowed background with
your photo-editing software.

What you find in this section might be more than you thought you’d need for

so you need to take this part of your business seriously. Of course, if you sell
only one type of item, you won’t need such a varied selection of stuff, but
you should have the basic photo setup.
Tripod
A tripod is an extendable aluminum stand that holds your camera. You should
look for one that has a quick release so that if you want to take the camera
off the tripod for a close-up, you don’t have to unscrew it from the base and
then screw it back on for the next picture.
The legs should extend to your desired height, lock in place with clamp-type
locks, and have a crank-style geared center column so that you can raise
your camera up and down for different shots. Most tripods also have a pan-
ning head for shooting from different angles. You can purchase a tripod from
a camera store or on eBay for as low as $25.
Power supplies
If you’ve ever used digital cameras, you know that they can blast through
batteries faster than sugar through a 5-year-old. A reliable power supply is a
must. You can accomplish this in a couple of ways:
Don’t ignore your camcorder!
The majority of eBay sellers use a digital camera
or a scanner to dress up their auctions with
images, but some just use what they already
own — their handy-dandy camcorders! Yup,
after videotaping your day at the beach, point
your lens at that Victorian doll and shoot. With
the help of a video-capturing device, you can
create a digital image right from the camera.
Although several companies offer video-
capturing devices, the one that I’m most
impressed with is Dazzle Digital Video Creator
(from Pinnacle Systems). This device sells for
under $100 and includes everything you need to
transfer and save pictures from your camcorder
(or VCR) to your computer. Visit the manufac-
turer’s Web site at www.pinnaclesys.com
for details about how the product works. Then
search eBay (of course) for the best prices.

✦Rechargeable batteries: Many specialists on eBay sell rechargeable bat-
teries and chargers. Choose quality Ni-MH (nickel metal hydride) batteries
because this kind, unlike Ni-Cad (nickel cadmium) batteries,  has no
memory effect. That means you don’t have to totally discharge them.
✦Lithium ion batteries: The CR-V3 is a new kind of battery that takes the
place of two standard AA batteries. Lithium batteries (also available in
other sizes) are the longest lasting and lightest batteries available, but
they’re also expensive. Then some smart guy figured out a way to put
two batteries into one unit; considerably cutting the price. This new bat-
tery can average 650 photos before you have to change it. The CR-V3 is
available also in a rechargeable form, thereby extending the life even fur-
ther (and reducing your battery budget significantly).
If your eBay photo studio includes a camera on a tripod (and it should), you
can charge your camera directly with the good, old-fashioned AC adapter
(you know, it’s the one that plugs into the wall).
Lighting
Trying to take good pictures of your merchandise can be frustrating. If you
don’t have enough light and use the camera’s flash, the image might be
washed out. If you take the item outside, the sun might cast a shadow.
The autofocus feature on most digital cameras doesn’t work well in low light.
I’ve seen some eBay sellers use a flash and instruct their children to shine a
flashlight on the item as they photograph it from different angles — all the
while hoping that the color isn’t wiped out.
After consulting specialists in the photo business to solve the digital camera
lighting problem, I put together an inexpensive studio lighting set for online
auction photography. Please check my Web site (www.coolebaytools.com)
for information on how to obtain this package. It’s the same one that I suc-
cessfully use in my home photo studio (refer to Figures 1-1 and 1-2).
Professional studio lights can be expensive, but you might be able to find a
set for around $150. (You need at least two lights, one for either side of the
item, to eliminate shadows.) Search eBay for used studio lighting; I’m sure
you’ll find a good deal.
If you’re photographing small items, you can successfully use an Ott-Lite or 
a less expensive generic version, as shown in Figure 1-3. The lamp’s bulb is a
full-spectrum, daylight 5000K florescent tube, good enough for jewelry pho-
tography. This same light is used when grading diamonds.

Other Studio Equipment
450
The color temperature of a light, which ranges from 2500°K to 7800°K, is 
a number given to a lighting condition. The K after the number signifies 
the Kelvin temperature range. Actual daylight color temperature is about
5500°K, and it’s best to get your lighting as close to that as you can. Using a
bulb with a daylight number is important because it’s a pure neutral, which
means that it throws no blue or yellow cast on your images.
Photo cube
How much do I love my photo cube? I could write a poem! It allows me to
take the most detailed photos of antiques and specialty items at night in my
home. It works incredibly well wherever I use it because my kit includes two
floodlights (and it all packs up into a neat bag). The nylon cube diffuses the
light so that there are no harsh shadows and I don’t burn out minute details
with too much light. Take a look at the details in Figure 1-4.
Photo background and stage
Backgrounds come in many shapes and sizes. You can get paper, fabric, or
use one of the portable photo stages for smallish items.

In professional photo-talk, seamless is a large roll of 3-foot (and wider) paper
that comes in various colors and is suspended and draped behind the model
and over the floor. (Ever wonder why you never see the floor and wall come
together in professional photos?) Photographers also drape the seamless over
tabletop shots. Some people use fabrics such as muslin instead of seamless.
I recommend using neutral fabrics (such as white, light gray, natural, and
black) for photographing your merchandise so that the color of the fabric
doesn’t clash with or distract from your items. Some of the photo cubes on
eBay come with great low-wrinkle fabric backgrounds as well.
A photo stage is another valuable tool for taking pictures indoors or out.
Textured ABS plastic is manufactured so you can set it in a curve shape
(see Figure 1-5); the stage can be set on any surface and will permit you to
take a clean picture without any extraneous backgrounds. You can store it
flat on a bookshelf till you need it next.

Cloud Dome
If you’re going to photograph a lot of jewelry, collectible coins, or other metal-
lic items, you’ll become frustrated at the quality of your pictures. Metallic
objects seem to pick up random color from any kind of light you shine on
them for picture taking. Gold jewelry will photograph with a silver tone and
silver will look goldish!
After conferring with lots of eBay photo gurus, I was told the secret of getting
crisp, clear, close-up pictures: use a Cloud Dome. It stabilizes your camera
(just as if you were using a tripod) and filters all unwanted color tones, result-
ing in image colors that look like your item.
The Cloud Dome is a large plastic bowl on which you mount your camera. You
take your pictures through the dome. The translucent white plastic diffuses
the light so that your item is lit evenly from all sides, eliminating glare and
bad shadows. Check out the manufacturer’s Web site at www.clouddome.
com to see some amazing before and after pictures.
The Cloud Dome also manages to get the best images from gems. You can
actually capture the light in the facets! Pearls, too, will show their luster.
Several eBay members (including yours truly) sell the Cloud Dome; I highly
recommend it! In Chapter 2, I show you how to use it.
Props
To take good photos, you need some props. Although you may think it strange
that a line item in your accounting program will read props, they do qualify as
a business expense. (Okay, you can put it under photography expense; props
just sounds so Hollywood!)
How often have you seen some clothing on eBay from a quality manufacturer,
but you just couldn’t bring yourself to bid more than $10 because it looked
like it had been dragged behind a car and then hung on a hanger before it
was photographed? Could you see how the fabric would hang on a body?
Of course not.
Mannequin
If you’re selling clothing, you’d better photograph it on a mannequin. If you
don’t want to dive right in and buy a mannequin, at least get a body form to
wear the outfit. Just search eBay for mannequin to find hundreds of hollow
forms selling for less than $20. If you sell children’s clothing, get a child’s
mannequin form as well. The same goes for men’s clothes. If worst comes to
worst, find a friend to model the clothes. There’s just no excuse for hanger-
displayed merchandise in your auctions.

I got my mannequin (Midge) at a department store liquidation sale here in
Los Angeles. I paid $25 for her. Her face is a little creepy, so I often crop her
head out of the photos. She has a great body and everything she wears sells
at a profit. Many stores upgrade their mannequins every few years or so. If
you know people who work at a retail store, ask when they plan to sell their
old mannequins; you may be able to pick one up at a reasonable price.
Display stands, risers, and more
Jewelry doesn’t photograph well on a person’s hand and looks a lot better
when you display it on a stand (see Figure 1-6) or a velvet pad. If you’re selling
a necklace, display it on a necklace stand, not on a person. I bought my dis-
play stands from a manufacturer but had to wait several months to receive
them. Apparently, this type of quality display stand is made to order, so I rec-
ommend searching for them on eBay (you’ll get them sooner).
Risers can be almost anything that you use to prop up your item to make it
more attractive in a picture. Put riser pieces that aren’t attractive under the
cloth that you use as a background. Keep a collection of risers and propping
materials in your photo area so they’re always close at hand.
You wouldn’t believe what the back of some professional photo setups look
like. Photographers and photo stylists think resourcefully when it comes to
making the merchandise look good — from the front of the picture, anyway!

Throughout my years of working with professional photographers, I’ve seen
the most creative things used to prop up items for photography:
✦Bottles of mercury: Mercury is a heavy liquid metal. A photographer I
once worked with used little bottles of this stuff to prop up small boxes
and other items in a picture. But mercury is a poison, so I suggest you
do the same with small bottles (prescription bottles work well) filled
with sand.
✦Beeswax and clay: To set up photos for catalogs, I’ve seen photogra-
phers prop up fine jewelry and collectible porcelain with beeswax (the
kind you can get from the orthodontist works great) or clay. Beeswax is
a neutral color and doesn’t usually show up in the photo. However, you
must dispose of beeswax often because it picks up dirt from your hands
and fuzz from fabric.
✦Museum Gel or Quake Hold: These two products are invaluable when
you want to hold a small object at an unnatural angle for a photograph.
(They’re like beeswax and clay, but cleaner.) Museums use this puttylike
product to securely keep breakables in one place — even during an
earthquake! Museum Gel can sometimes be difficult to remove from
items, so that’s why I use Quake Hold putty for my eBay items.
✦Metal clamps and duct tape: These multipurpose items are used in many
photo shoots in some of the strangest places. Your mannequin may be a
few sizes too small for the dress you want to photograph. How do you
fix that? Don’t pad the mannequin; simply fold over the dress in the back
and clamp the excess material with a metal clamp, or use a clothespin or
a small piece of duct tape to hold the fabric taut.

P
hotography has always been a passion for me. The hobby led me (at 
the age of 10) from developing film in a tiny storage-closet darkroom
through my first side-advertising job for a camera store (yes, I was always a
moonlighter) to a great professional gig taking photographs of NASCAR auto
racing for magazines and newspapers. I worked also with professional cata-
log photographers and picked up some tricks for setting up pictures, buffing
up the merchandise, and making everything look picture-perfect. In this
chapter, I pass on the tips and shortcuts to you. Use these ideas to take
great pictures that flatter your merchandise and help you sell!
Photo Guidelines
The idea behind using images in your auctions is to attract tons of potential
buyers. With that goal in mind, you should try to create the best-looking
images possible, no matter what kind of technology you’re using to capture
them.
Point-and-shoot may be okay for a group shot at a historical monument, but
illustrating your auction is a whole different idea. Whether you’re using a
traditional film camera (so that you can scan your developed photographs
later) or a digital camera to capture your item, some basic photographic
guidelines can give you better results:
✦Do take the picture of your item outside, in filtered daylight, whenever
possible. That way, the camera can catch all possible details and color.
If you can’t take your images during the day, use a good set of flood-
lights, either on clamps or stands.

Photo Guidelines
456
✦Do forget about fancy backgrounds; they distract viewers from your
item. Put small items on a neutral-colored, nonreflective towel or cloth;
put larger items in front of a neutral-colored wall or curtain. You’ll crop
out almost all the background when you prepare the picture on your
computer before uploading the image.
✦Do avoid getting yourself in the photo by shooting your pictures from an
angle. If you see your reflection in the item, move and try again.
One of my favorite eBay pictures featured a piece of fine silver taken by
the husband of the lady selling the piece on eBay. Silver and reflective
items are hard to photograph because they pick up everything in the
room in their reflection. In her description, the lady explained that the
man reflected in the silver coffeepot was her husband and not part of
the final deal. She handled that very well! To solve this reflective prob-
lem, take pictures of silvery objects in a photo cube.
✦Do use extra lighting. You can do this with your camera’s flash mode or
with extra photo lighting on stands. Use extra lighting even when you’re
taking the picture outside. The extra lighting acts as fill light — it adds
more light to the item, filling in some of the shadowed spots.
✦Don’t get so close to the item that the flash washes out (overexposes)
the image. The easiest way to figure out the best distance is by trial and
error. Start close and keep moving farther away until you get the results
you want.
✦Do take two or three acceptable versions of your image. You can choose
the best one later on your computer.
✦Do take a close-up or two of detailed areas that you want buyers to see
(in addition to a wide shot of the entire item), if your item relies on detail.
✦Do make sure that the items are clean. Cellophane on boxes can get
nasty looking, clothing can get linty, and all merchandise can get dirt
smudges. Not only will your items photograph better if they’re clean,
they’ll sell better, too.
✦Do make sure that you focus the camera; nothing is worse than a blurry
picture. If your camera is a fixed-focus model (it can’t be adjusted), get
only as close as the manufacturer recommends. Automatic-focus cam-
eras measure the distance and change the lens setting as needed. But
just because a camera has an autofocus feature doesn’t mean that pic-
tures automatically come out crisp and clear. Low light, high moisture,
and other things can contribute to a blurred image. Double-check the
picture before you use it.
Some eBay creeps, whether out of laziness or deceit, steal images from other
eBay members. (They simply make a digital copy of the image and use it in
their own auctions. This is so uncool because the copied image doesn’t repre-
sent their item.) This pilfering has happened to me on several occasions. To
prevent picture-snatching, you can add your user ID to all your photos. The

next time somebody lifts one of your pictures, it has your name on it. If you’re
familiar with adding HTML code to your auctions, check out the simple Java
code on my Web site (www.coolebaytools.com) that you can insert in your
auction descriptions to prevent unscrupulous users from stealing your images.
Lifting another seller’s photos is against eBay’s rules, so be sure to report
the photo-thieving seller to eBay’s Security Center at
http://pages.ebay.com/securitycenter/
Avoid using incandescent or fluorescent lighting to illuminate the photos
you take. Incandescent lighting tends to make items look yellowish, and fluo-
rescent lights lend a bluish tone to your photos. One exception is GE Reveal
incandescent bulbs, which throw a good natural light. Halogen lights give a
nice bright white, but they have a tendency to get very hot!
Photographing the Tuff Stuff: Coins and Jewelry
I’ve been selling on eBay since 1997 and thought I was pretty good at show-
ing off and selling my wares. But then I purchased a small lot of Morgan silver
dollars to resell. I figured, no problem, I’d take my standard digital picture
and sell away. Oops, my mistake. The digital pictures made my beautiful
silver coins look gold!
Then came my next challenge: photographing some silvertone and goldtone
costume jewelry. My setup — with its perfect positioning, beautiful lighting,
and black velvet jewelry pads — looked stunning. The pictures should have
been perfect. But the silvertone looked gold, and the goldtone looked silver.
What’s the deal?
The deal is lighting — specifically, the need for ambient lighting. I thought
back to when I worked with catalog photographers who took pictures of 
jewelry — and I remembered the elaborate setup they used to produce the
sparkling images you see in the ads. And although I can closely recreate 
the experts’ silk tents with photo cubes, the minimalist lighting and multiple
light flashes per exposure of the professional photographer’s setup can’t 
be duplicated easily at home.
Also, when taking close focus, highly zoomed-in pictures, holding your camera
steady is of utmost importance. Using a tripod is difficult with close-up pic-
tures, so using a Cloud Dome is the best option because your camera mounts
directly to the Dome and is held still as if you were using a tripod.
When you use flash or flood lighting alone (without a Cloud Dome) for pictures
of metallic objects, your photographs include shiny spots from reflections
(off walls and ceilings), washed out areas from the glare of the lights, and

Photographing the Tuff Stuff: Coins and Jewelry
458
loss of proper color. Ambient light (light that occurs naturally) is the best
light for photographing many types of items, especially shiny items.
Enter the Cloud Dome, a giant bowl that you place upside-down over the
object you want to photograph. This bowl evenly diffuses ambient room
light over the surface area of the object. This way, you can produce quality
digital images in average room lighting, without hot spots, shadows, or
inconsistent lighting.
Shooting with the Cloud Dome
The Cloud Dome looks like a giant Tupperware bowl with a camera mount
attached. Figure 2-1 shows a Cloud Dome being set up to photograph jewelry.
Follow these steps to take a picture with the Cloud Dome:
1. Attach your camera to the Cloud Dome’s mount with the lens posi-
tioned so that it peers into the hole at the top of the dome.
2. Place your item on top of a contrasting background.
See the following section, “Tips for taking Cloud Dome pictures,” for
ideas on choosing a background.
3. Place the dome with camera attached over your item.
4. Check the item’s position through your camera’s viewfinder or LCD
screen.
If the item is not in the center, center it. If you feel you need additional
lighting to bring out a highlight, use a lamp outside the dome.
5. Focus your camera and shoot the picture.

Many items benefit from being photographed through a Cloud Dome, espe-
cially the following:
✦Jewelry: I’ve found that taking pictures with the Dome keeps the gold
color gold and the silver color silver. Also, using the Cloud Dome helps
your camera pick up details such as engraving and the metal surround-
ing cloisonné work. It also gives pearls and gold their unique luster and
soft reflection, as shown in Figure 2-2.
✦Gems and stones: I’ve seen some beautiful pictures taken of gems and
stones with the Cloud Dome. To achieve a special look, you can use a
Cloud Dome accessory, a reversible gold and silver reflector. Especially
when you use the silver side, facets of diamonds glisten as if they were
in the pinpoint lights at the jeweler’s. You may also want to focus a
floodlight or lamp on the outside of the dome for extra sparkle.
✦Coins and stamps: The Cloud Dome allows you to hold the camera steady
for extreme close-ups. It also allows you to photograph coins without get-
ting any coloration that is not on the coin. For both coins and stamps, the
Cloud Dome helps you achieve sharp focus and true color.
✦Holographic or metallic accented items: If you’ve ever tried to photo-
graph collector cards, you know that the metal accents glare and holo-
grams are impossible to capture. Also, the glossy coatings confuse the
camera’s light sensors, causing over-exposed highlights.

✦Reflective objects: Items such as silverware or even computer chips
reflect a lot of light when lit properly for photos. The Cloud Dome dif-
fuses the light so that the pictures become clear. Check out the before
and after photos in Figure 2-3.
Tips for taking Cloud Dome pictures
Surprisingly, there’s little learning curve to using a Cloud Dome. The simple
steps in the preceding section attest to this fact. What may take you more
time is discovering the tips and tricks that help you achieve professional-
looking results. This section should kick-start your discovery process:
✦Focus, focus: Due to the focus limitations of many of today’s digital 
cameras, I found it best to use the Cloud Dome with the extension collar
(often sold along with the dome), which allows you to have your camera
17 inches away from the item you’re photographing on a flat surface.
✦Get in close to your item: When attempting macro (extreme close-up)
photography, the Cloud Dome holds your camera still while you shoot
the picture. If you prefer, after you’ve centered your item, stand away
and take the picture using your camera’s self-timer.

✦Find upstanding items: If your item is vertical and doesn’t lend itself
to being photographed flat, use the Cloud Dome’s angled collar, which
allows you to shoot the item from an angle versus from the top.
✦Keep background where it belongs: When selecting a background for
your item, choose a contrasting background that reflects the light prop-
erly for your item. Make it a solid color; white is always safe and black
can add dramatic highlights.
Prepping and Photographing Clothing
When photographing apparel for eBay, the one rule is: Take the best picture
you can and move on to the next item so that you can hurry up and list all
the items for sale. Period.
And even though I’ve just said there’s only one rule, I also know that taking
the best picture involves a bit of preparation on your part. Figure 2-4 shows
the results of an eBay search for the keyword dress. Which of these items
looks better — the ones laid out on the floor or those on a mannequin or
model? A designer dress in this search probably would have sold for twice
the amount if it had been on a mannequin!

Prepping and Photographing Clothing
462
One of the worst ways to photograph clothing is on a tabletop or folded on the
floor. The camera misses essential details in the folded items, and you miss
the opportunity to show off the clothing in all its glory — as worn on a body.
To get the highest bids, give your clothing an authentic, lifelike appearance.
Scanning photographs from a catalog is just as much of a copyright violation
as stealing a picture from the manufacturer’s Web site. eBay may end your
listing if the violation is reported.
Apparel photography can be tricky by all measures, especially when you
don’t have a model. Using a model is a great idea if you have plenty of time 
to spare. When you work with a model (even if it’s a son or daughter or a
friend), you’ll have to take many shots of them wearing the same item,
because you want the model to look as good as the clothing and vice versa.
Not a timesaver.
What’s the best way to shoot fashion for eBay? Assembly line. Henry Ford
had it right. Have everything assembled in one area and the process can go
smoothly and quickly. In this section, I tell you about how to prepare your
studio, your props, and your clothing to get the best picture for the least
effort. And best of all, the time you spend preparing the clothes to photo-
graph also makes them customer-ready. Now, there’s a timesaver!
Cleaning and pressing essentials
Before you photograph your clothing, make sure the clothing itself imparts
the image you want your buyers to see. For example, remove any loose
threads and lint that has accumulated on the fabric.
Have the following items handy to help you with the cleaning and pressing
chores:
✦Garment rack: When you unpack your merchandise from the carton it
was shipped to you in, it can look pretty ragged. And if you’ve purchased
some hanging merchandise and it’s in tip-top shape, you’ll want to keep it
that way. Hanging the merchandise on a garment rack (see Figure 2-5)
keeps it fresh-looking so it looks great when you get ready to ship.
✦Steamer: Retail stores, clothing manufacturers, and drycleaners all use
steamers. Why? Because steaming the garment with a steam wand is
kinder to the fabric and takes wrinkles out in a hurry. Steam penetrates
the fabric (not crushing it, as does ironing) and seems to make the fabric
look better than before.

Steaming is also five times faster than ironing (and not as backbreaking),
so that’s why it’s truly the professional’s choice. Steaming garments is a
breeze; see for yourself in Figure 2-6.

A handheld travel steamer will work for beginners who sell one or 
two apparel items a month. While you can steam a garment with a 
professional-style steamer in a minute or two, you might have to work
on a garment with a travel steamer for 15 minutes. If you’re thinking
about selling a quantity of clothes on eBay, a professional-style, roll-base
steamer is what you should look for.
I use a Jiffy Steamer that I’ve had for quite a while. (I even bought it on
eBay and got a great deal.) It’s the same kind they use in retail stores,
only slightly smaller.
✦Dryel: A popular, reasonably priced, home dry-cleaning product you use
in your dryer, Dryel can be used with almost any type of garment (be sure
to double-check the packaging before you use it). After going through a
Dryel treatment, clothes come out of the dryer sweet and clean. The
starter kit even comes with a spot remover. You can buy Dryel at your
local supermarket.
According to eBay rules, all used clothing must be cleaned before it is
sold on the site. Even if the vintage garment you have up for sale is
clean, it can always benefit by a roll in the dryer with Dryel. New gar-
ments, too, benefit; Dryel removes any smells that have clung to the 
garment during its travels.
✦Spot cleaners: I recommend that you use spot cleaners only if you know
what you’re doing. Some really great ones out there will remove a small
spot, but you’d best practice on items that you’re not selling first.
Steaming hot tips
Keep these tips in mind when steaming the
clothes you sell on eBay:
 Always keep the steam head in an upright
position so that the condensation inside the
hose drains back into the steamer.
 Run the steam head lightly down the fabric.
 Hang pants by the cuff when steaming.
 Don’t let the steam head come directly in
contact with velvet or silk; otherwise, you
may spot the fabric.
 Steam velvet (or any fabric with a pile) from
the reverse side.
 Heavy fabrics may do better by steaming
from the underside of the fabric.
 When you’re through steaming your clothes
for eBay, try steaming your mattresses and
furniture. Steaming has been proven to kill a
majority of dust mites and their accompa-
nying nastiness.

Assembling your fashion photo studio
Photographing fashion right takes a little time, but the right tools make the
project easier. Here’s a list of some of the items you’ll need when photo-
graphing clothing:
✦Mannequin body double: You don’t want to deal with supermodels and
their requirements for nonfat vanilla lattes, so you have to find someone
who will model the garments and not give you any grief. Figure 2-7 pictures
my mannequin, Midge, who has sold lots of dresses on eBay for me.
Full-body mannequins can be purchased on eBay for about $200. I bought
Midge from a local store that was updating their mannequins. Major
department stores often liquidate their display merchandise in auctions,
so keep your eyes peeled in your local newspaper for auctions of store
fixtures.
Keep in mind that you needn’t spend a mint on a brand-new model. If your
mannequin is used and has a few paint chips — so what?
Following are some less expensive alternatives to a mannequin:
• Molded body form: Before you decide to jump in with both feet, you
might want to try using a hanging body form. These are molded torsos
that have a hanger at the top. You can find molded styrene forms on

eBay for as little as $20. If you decide to stay in the apparel vending
business, you can always upgrade to a full-size mannequin.
• Dressmaker’s adjustable form: You can also use a dressmaker’s form
to model your eBay clothing. The best part about using these is that
you can adjust the size of the body to fit your clothing. You can often
find new or good-condition used ones on eBay for under $100.
✦Vertical photo lights on stands: To light your merchandise, you’ll do best
to invest in some floodlights. You don’t have to spend a mint, but as you’ll
see when you start taking pictures, the little flash on your camera can’t
accentuate the good parts of your apparel. You may want to stop the
flash on your camera from going off altogether when you take pictures 
of clothes, because too much light coming from the front will wash out
the detail in the fabric.
Place the mannequin in the middle of your studio area. Situate a flood-
light on either side and closer to the camera than the mannequin. Your
setup will be a V-shape, with your mannequin at the point, your flood-
lights at the top of each V-side, and you or a tripod holding the camera
in the middle at the top of the V. Adjust the distance that you place your
lights as needed. Be sure to tilt the light heads to pick up extra detail in
the clothing.
✦Clothespins: To fit your clothing on the mannequin, use clothespins to
take up any slack in the garment (be sure to place the clothespins where
the camera won’t see them). Before you think I’m crazy, I’ll have you
know that clothespins were used in almost every apparel photo that I’ve
participated in. Think about it: The clothing you’re selling will come in
different sizes and may not always hang right on your mannequin.

This section shows you a bunch of big-time don’ts. We’ve seen images like
these all over eBay at one time or another.
Mistake #1
Figure 2-8 shows a nice item, but the picture suffers from two major flaws:
✦A glare from the camera’s flash shows in the cellophane on the item.
This can be avoided by turning the item slightly at an angle so that the
flash doesn’t give off such a bright glare.
✦The price sticker is smack on the front of the item. Often you’ll buy
things for resale that have stickers. Be a pro — use a commercial prod-
uct (see Chapter 1) to remove stickers.

Mistake #2
Don’t dress your picture with props to decorate the scene. Your photo should
be a crisp, clean image of the product you’re selling, and only that. Figure 2-9
shows a common eBay seller mistake. What a cute teddy — but what are you
selling here?

Mistake #3
I never knew how much colorful upholstery people had in their homes. I’ve
seen items photographed on plaid, floral, and striped fabrics (see Figure 2-10).
It distracts from your item. Don’t do it.
Mistake #4
I’m sure the item in the box shown in Figure 2-11 is desirable, but who can
make that judgment without seeing the item? Take the item out of the box.
If the box is a crucial part of the deal (as in collectibles), be sure to mention
that the box is included in the sale.
If you can’t open the box without ruining the value of the item, pull in for a
macro close up. When you have a quantity of the item, bite the bullet and
open one up. A good picture gets you higher bids, and perhaps that loss of
one item will be made up by the higher bids on the sales with good pictures.
Mistake #5
Can you say close-up? Use the zoom on your camera to fill the frame with a full
picture of your item. Draw your camera close to the item so the prospective
customer can see some detail. Don’t take a wide picture of the area around the
item, like the shot shown in Figure 2-12. Don’t just rely on cropping the picture
in an image-editing program; that only makes the image smaller.

 Writing a good description
 Using eBay’s HTML tool 
 Buffing up your auctions with basic HTML
 Making friends with tables
 Generating auction descriptions with CuteHTML 
 Creating an ad — fast
I
must admit, the very thought of using HTML in my auctions used to terrify
me (pinky swear you won’t tell the people at eBay). HTML. Doesn’t it
sound so high-tech and geeklike? But HTML isn’t all that scary after you real-
ize that it’s just a fancy name for HyperText Markup Language, an easy-to-use
language for creating online content. All you need to know is the markup part. 
HTML uses tags to mark pages to include elements such as text and graph-
ics in a way that Web browsers understand. A Web browser sees the tags,
and knows how to display the document (that is, the Web page). HTML also
makes possible the whole work of links. When you click a link, you jump to
another place: another Web page, document, or file, for example.
Luckily, you don’t have to know a lot of code to produce eBay auctions. My
small grasp of HTML gets me only so far, so I usually use CuteHTML to pro-
duce code for my Web site or eBay listings. I’ve developed my own templates
so that all I have to do is replace the text with each new listing. This chapter
shows you how to do it too.
In addition, the Sell Your Item form has an excellent (but basic) HTML gener-
ator that you use like a word processor to format text. I show you how to
make this convenient tool do magic with your listings. 

Writing Good Descriptions
472
Writing Good Descriptions
Many eBay sellers somehow think that putting dancing bears, flaming graphics,
and background music in their auctions will bring in more bids. Unfortunately,
that’s pretty far from the truth. People go to your auctions to find information
and a great deal on something they want, not to be entertained. They need
to see the facts, placed cleanly and neatly on the page. 
The addition of music to your auction may cause another problem: An
extremely s-l-o-o-o-o-w page load for those with dial-up connections. If loading
your page takes too long, believe me, most people will go to another listing. 
So what should you do to attract buyers? I spent most of my career in the
advertising business, and the byword of good advertising is, “Keep it simple!”
An organized and well-written selling description will outsell dancing bears
and pictures of your children every time.
When you write the descriptions for your auctions, be sure that you
describe your items clearly and completely. Mention everything about the
item; be honest and even mention flaws or damage. When you’re honest up
front, you’ll have a happy bidder. Remember to include your terms of sale
and specify what type of payments and credit cards you accept. Be sure to
include your shipping charges, too. 
After you list all the facts, get excited and add a little flowery text in your
description. Think infomercial! Think Shopping Channel! Whoopee! They
make things sound so good that you feel that you must have whatever item
they’re selling. You can do the same, if you just take the time. In Book III,
Chapter 3, I give you basic pointers on writing the best auction descriptions
possible. 
HTML the Easy eBay Way
Luckily, you don’t have to know a lot of code to produce eBay auctions. The
Sell Your Item form has an excellent (but basic) HTML generator that has
features similar to a word processor, as shown at the top of Figure 3-1. 
To apply any of these features (such as bold or italic) to your text, you
simply highlight the text and click one of the buttons.
When inputting text, you may notice that eBay’s tool inserts a line space
after text when you start a new paragraph. If you want the text to wrap 
(as in the headline of Figure 3-1) and not have a blank space between text
lines, hold down the Shift key while you press the Enter (or Return) key.
That forces an HTML line break instead of a paragraph break.

Starting at the top left in Figure 3-1, you see three drop-down lists. Click to
the right of each box and the following options appear:
✦Font name: Apply different fonts to your text. You can choose Arial,
Courier, Times, and Verdana. Play around with the different fonts to see
which ones you prefer.
✦Size: You can increase or decrease the size of the type. It reads in num-
bers, or point size. The smallest is 8 point and the largest is 36 point.
✦Color: Want to add some color to your text? Just highlight the text and
select black, blue, red, green, or brown.
After these three drop-down lists, you see a row of buttons:
Boldface text
Italicize text
Underline text

To add an insert to your description, simply place your cursor where you’d
like the insert to appear, and click that selection from the menu.
You can even create custom inserts up to 1000 characters! Create inserts for
frequently used text, such as promotional messages, custom policies, or war-
ranty information. Just follow these steps:
1. Choose Insert➪Create an Insert.
The screen shown in Figure 3-3 appears.
2. In the first box, type a name for your insert.
3. In the second box, type your text or HTML coding (up to 1000

4. When you’re through, click the Save button.
After you create your custom insert, you can add it to any of your descrip-
tions with a click of your mouse. How convenient!

When you want to dress up your auctions, you could use one of eBay’s
graphic themes. That would add an additional $.10 to your listing fee. Or you
could insert your own graphics into your listing, and it wouldn’t cost you

Getting Friendly with HTML

any extra fees. But even if you use one of eBay’s lovely graphic designs, you
still need to format your text. That’s where HTML coding comes in. 
You can also use HTML to insert multiple pictures in your descriptions to
better promote your item. This won’t cost you extra, and you can still use the
one free photo from eBay’s Picture Services for your top-of-listing picture. For
information on how to upload your images to a server, see Chapter 5.
What HTML can do
Take a look at Figure 3-4. It contains an auction description I typed in the
Notepad program (which you can find under Windows Accessories).
If I add some appropriate HTML coding to the file, the auction page looks a
whole lot different, as you can see in Figure 3-5. Pretty cool, huh? 
How HTML works
HTML uses a series of codes to indicate display information to a browser,
such as when text should be bold or italic or when text is actually a link.
Brackets are used to indicate commands. What’s within the brackets is an
instruction rather than actual text that appears on your page.

In the example that follows, the b and i in brackets indicate that text between
them should be formatted bold and italic, respectively. Notice that there is
both a start formatting and end formatting indication (<b> starts bold for-
matting and </b> ends it.) Here’s one example:
HTML start and end tags: <b><i></i></b>
Tags with text between them:<b><i>eBay tools</i></b>
The resulting text on your page: eBay tools
Table 3-1 lists many common HTML tags to get you started. Keep in mind
that HTML is not case sensitive, so feel free to leave your Caps Lock on if it
makes you happy.

A few things to keep in mind about HTML:
✦Don’t worry about pressing Enter at the end of a line. You must use a
command to go to the next line, so pressing Enter on your keyboard has
no effect on what the page looks like.
✦Most HTML coding has a beginning and an end. The beginning code is in
angle brackets. To end the formatting, you repeat the code in brackets,
only this time with a slash to end the command </>.
✦It’s not necessary to put the paragraph command at the beginning and
at the end of the paragraph. This is one command that doesn’t need a
close. Just put the command, <p>, where you want the breaking space.
This applies also for a horizontal rule, <hr>. Just place the command
where you want the line and it will appear.
✦People have different fonts set up on their computers, so they may not
have the funky font you want to display. Be sure to list alternate fonts for
your text. If you don’t, different browsers may substitute other fonts that
might look really funky on some readers’ pages!

Add pictures to your listing for free 
“How do I put pictures in my auction descrip-
tion?” Here’s the answer to the question I’m
asked most when I teach a class on eBay. Many
sellers have more than one picture within the
auction description area. By putting extra images
in the description, they don’t have to pay extra for
eBay’s hosting services. This isn’t magic; you can
do it too. Just add a tiny bit of HTML code in your
auction description. Don’t freak out on me now,
you can do this. Here is the HTML code to insert
one picture in your auction:
<img src=http://www.yourserver.
com/imagename.jpg>
Be sure to use the angle brackets (they’re
located above the comma and the period on
your keyboard) to open and close your code. 
When you want to insert two pictures, just
insert code for each picture, one after the other.
If you want one picture to appear below the
other, use the HTML code for line break, <BR>.
Here’s how to write that:
<img src=http://www.yourserver.
com/imagename1.jpg> <BR>

Using HTML Table Codes to Make Templates
Have you ever noticed how some people manage to have a photo on the
right or the left side of their descriptions? It’s not that difficult to do. You
add a little HTML code to the listing using something called tables. 
For example, Figure 3-6 shows a picture contained in a table on the left side
of the description. (By the way, when the full version of this auction ran on
eBay, with the kind cooperation of the people on The View, we raised more
than $1000 for UNICEF!)

Creating Your Own HTML Template
Once you’re ready to take on eBay in earnest, it really helps to have a few
auction description templates all set up and ready to go. This is what the big
guys, those top sellers on eBay, do (granted, some do a better job than others).
Although it’s fun to play around with using different graphics as you sell on
eBay — and I must admit, I’ve seem some cute ones — having a standard look
to your ads establishes you as a serious, professional seller. After all, how
often does eBay change its look? The answer is, not too often. The colors and
the basic look remain the same because this is eBay’s very valuable brand.
What might go into a template? Well, you can insert your logo within your
description, or put links to your About Me page or your store, for example.
Your template can become your brand.

Many auction-management services offer predesigned templates for your
descriptions, but they often charge a lot of money for their services. Alter-
nately, you can put together your own template, and update it occasionally. 
Keeping your look simple and showing off your product will bring in high
bids. Getting carried away with graphics that have nothing to do with your
item is distracting (unless you have a cute picture of your dog or cat —
everyone likes a fluffy mascot).
In this section I show you how to design simple templates using CuteHTML.
It’s a great tool that grows with you. The more HTML you understand, the
more you can do with it. In the next section, you use an HTML generator on
my Web site to create a template that you can customize with a little extra
knowledge of HTML.
Downloading CuteHTML
Few things in this life are absolute necessities, but photos in your eBay list-
ings definitely are! It’s a good idea to begin developing templates by building
a simple one that includes a space for a photo. You’ll use a program called
CuteHTML to do just that.
CuteHTML is a wonderful HTML generator from GlobalSCAPE. The software
(like me) has been around for many years, and over time the company has
added many useful features, though not so many that the program is difficult
to use. 
You can download a free trial version at
www.globalscape.com/o/914
After your free trial is over, you can opt to purchase the software for $19.99.
It’s worth it: The software will be a workhorse for you, as it has been for me,
through thousands of auctions. 
CuteHTML is bundled with another product, CuteFTP, an easy-to-use pro-
gram for uploading your eBay pictures to your Web space. Read more about
CuteFTP in Chapter 5.
Adding text and graphics
After you’ve downloaded and installed CuteHTML, open it and you’ll see a
page with some code on it. Just drag your mouse over this text and delete it.
The first time you use CuteHTML, choose Tools➪Settings. In the settings
dialog box, select the Word Wrap check box. With Word Wrap activated, the
text you enter will wrap to the next line so you can see all the text on the
screen. If Word Wrap is not activated, your text will go off the edge of the
screen as you type, wasting valuable time scrolling back and forth to read it.

Creating Your Own HTML Template
484
In the following steps, you create a table that contains a photo on the left
and text on the right:
1. Click the Table button on the toolbar or choose Tools➪Insert Tag.
A Table palette appears.
2. Click the top-left corner and drag to the right until the label at the
bottom reads 2 by 1 table, as shown in Figure 3-7. 
This creates a table with two cells side-by-side. 
3. Release your mouse button.
The table palette disappears and the HTML coding for two cells appears
on the screen (see Figure 3-8).

In CuteHTML, all HTML coding is in blue by default. Words you input
into the program are in black. Anchors (which are places that open
another Internet page upon a click by the viewer) appear in green and
links to Web pages or images appear in red.
4. Highlight the Row 1 Cell 1 text, between the HTML opening and
closing codes (<td> and </td>, and then click the Image button on
the toolbar. 
(The Image button looks like a little picture.) The Image Tag dialog box
appears. 
5. In the Source box, type the Internet address (URL) where your image
is stored. 
You can get the URL from your image hosting service or by locating the
image on the Internet and copying the URL from the top of your browser.
If you want to alter the size of your image, you can also type the width
or height (or both), in pixels, in the appropriate boxes. 
6. Click OK.
The HTML code for the image appears inside the text area.
7. Highlight the Row 1 Cell 2 text on your screen, and enter the
description text you want to appear next to the picture.
For convenience, you can also open an auction description you’ve already
written in Windows Notepad, and copy and paste it into the space.
Adding HTML formatting
Next, check your progress by clicking the View in Browser button (the mag-
nifying glass over a world globe) on the toolbar. This opens your work in a
browser window, so you can see how it would appear when viewed on the
Internet. As shown in Figure 3-9, all the sentences run together in one mam-
moth paragraph. 
To correct this, you can add HTML text attributes as follows:
1. Highlight the text you want to change.
2. Click the button on the toolbar for the text formatting style you want
to apply. 
The B button is for bold, I is for italic, and U is for underline. The format-
ting is applied automatically.
If you’d like to insert an additional HTML command (such as a command
for a line break, a paragraph, or a list) and you don’t see the corresponding
button on the toolbar, type an open HTML command bracket < and the first
letter of the command. A list of suggested commands will drop down in the
next text space, as shown in Figure 3-10. This is the program’s tag tips. Click
the one you need, and the HTML command is inserted. Then type the closing
bracket, >. See the HTML tags in Table 3-1 for suggestions.

Chapter 4: Getting Your
Photos Ready for eBay
In This Chapter
 Getting the photo file size right
 Considering edits to your photo
 Touching up your photo
I
n this chapter, I show you how fast you can get the photos you take — or
the scans you make — spruced up for eBay. No eBay seller should spend
hours playing with and perfecting images for eBay listings (although some
do). One pass through a simple image-editing software program gets any
reasonable picture Internet-ready.
Then, after your pictures are, well, picture perfect, look to Chapter 5 for
some easy ways to upload your images to the Web.
Size Matters
The prime concern to have about the pictures you put on eBay is size —
that’s right, in this case, size does matter. You need to limit the picture file
size so you don’t bog down the prospective buyer’s viewing of your item
page (especially if you’re using multiple pictures in the item description).
Why? That’s easy. The larger your item’s picture files, the longer the
browser takes to load the item page. And four out of five eBay users will
click back out of a listing to avoid a long page load. (I’m guessing that you
don’t want your listings to elicit that behavior.)
To get a better idea of the size for the images you use online, remember that
no matter which camera setting you choose, your image should be designed
to be viewed on a monitor. Low resolution is just fine because the average
computer monitor isn’t an HDTV.
The average monitor resolution settings (in pixels) are
✦640 x 480 (VGA)
✦800 x 600 (Super VGA)
✦1024 x 768 (XVGA)

Size Matters
492
These settings determine the number of pixels that can be viewed on the
screen. No matter how large your monitor is (whether 15, 17, or even 21
inches), it shows only as many pixels as you determine in its settings. On
larger screens, the pixels just get larger — and make your pictures fuzzy.
That’s why most people with larger screens set their monitors for a higher
resolution.
Remember that scanned images are measured in dpi (dots per inch). The
average monitor displays scanned images at 72 dpi. Do not confuse this with
pixel size.
Because higher resolutions make the screen images smaller, many users
prefer their screens at the 800 x 600 size for eye comfort. They don’t want 
to squint!
If you use eBay’s Picture Services for your all eBay items, setting your image
size is not a big issue. eBay Picture Services applies a compression algorithm
that forces your pictures into eBay’s prescribed size.
The more compression put into computer images, the less sharp they appear.
So why not set your images with your camera or image-editing program to a
monitor-friendly size in a software program before uploading them.
Here’s a checklist of tried-and-true techniques for preparing elegantly slen-
der, fast-loading images to display on eBay:
✦Set your image resolution at 72 pixels per inch. You can do this with
the settings for your scanner. Although 72 ppi may seem like a low reso-
lution, it nibbles computer memory, shows up fast on a buyer’s screen,
and looks great on eBay.
✦When using a digital camera, set the camera to no higher than the
640 x 480 format. That’s custom made for a VGA monitor. You can
always crop the picture if it’s too large. You can even save the image at
320 x 240. It will display well on eBay but take up less space, so you can
add more pictures!
✦Make the finished image no larger than 480 pixels wide. When you
size your picture in your image software, it’s best to keep it no larger
than 300 x 300 pixels or 4 inches square. These dimensions are big
enough for people to see the image without squinting, and the details
of your item show up nicely.
✦Crop any unnecessary areas of the photo. You need to show only your
item; everything else is a waste.
✦Use your software to darken or change the photo’s contrast. When the
image looks good on your computer screen, the image looks good on
your eBay auction page.

Book V
Chapter 4

493
✦Save your image as a JPG file. When you finish editing your picture, save
it as a JPG file. (To do this, follow the instructions that come with your
software.) JPG is the best format for eBay; it compresses information into
a small file that builds fast and reproduces nicely on the Internet.
✦Check the total size of your image. After you save the image, check its
total size. If the size hovers around 40K or smaller, eBay users won’t
have a hard time seeing the image in a reasonable amount of time.
✦If your image is larger than 50K, reduce it. Small is fast, efficient, and
beautiful. Big is slow, sluggish, and dangerous. Impatient eBay users will
move on to the next listing if they have to wait to see your image.
Adding the Artist’s Touch
Pictures don’t always come out of the camera in perfect form. However, you
can make a few tweaks to bring them into perfection range:
✦Alter the size: Reduce or increase the size or shape of the image.
✦Change the orientation: Rotate the image left or right; flip it horizontally
or vertically.
✦Crop the background: Sometimes there’s a little too much background
and not enough product. Don’t waste precious bandwidth on extraneous
pixels. To crop your image means to cut away the unnecessary part of
the picture.
✦Adjust the brightness and contrast: These two functions usually work
together in most photo programs. By giving your picture more bright-
ness, the picture looks brighter (duh). Raising contrast brings out the
detail, and lowering it dulls the difference between light and dark.
✦Sharpen: If your camera was not perfectly in focus when you took the
picture, applying a photo-editing program’s sharpen feature can help.
If you sharpen too much, however, you can destroy the smoothness of
the image.
If your image needs any more help than these alterations, it’s probably
easier and faster to just retake the picture.
Image-Editing Software
eBay sellers use a wide array of image-editing software. As a matter of fact,
some listing software has built-in mini-editing capabilities. (See Book VIII for
more on third-party software for eBay.) Choosing software for your images is
like choosing an office chair. What’s right for some people is dreadful for
others. You might want to ask some of your friends what they use — and
take a look at it.

Image-Editing Software

When you buy a camera, it will no doubt arrive with a CD that includes some
variation of image-editing software. Give the software a try. If it works well
for you, keep it. If not, check out the two options I mention later.
Using Microsoft’s simple Photo Editor
Photo Editor is the most basic of picture-edit-
ing programs, but it may be a good place to
start. If you have Microsoft Office, check to see
whether you have Photo Editor on your Start
menu under Microsoft Office Tools. (Sometimes
Photo Editor is even bundled with Windows.)
You may have to search your hard drive for the
photoed.exe file.
If you don’t see Photo Editor on your computer,
get out your Microsoft Office CD. Photo Editor is
included on the CD but doesn’t install automat-
ically. Here’s how to install it in Microsoft Office
2000:
1. Insert the Office CD.
2. Click Add or Remove Features.
You see a screen of Office programs.
3. Click the plus sign next to Office Tools.
A screen similar to the one in the figure
appears.
4. Scroll down the list until you see
Microsoft Photo Editor.
5. Click the box next to Photo Editor, and
choose Run from My Computer.
6. Click Update Now (in the lower-right
corner).
Microsoft Photo Editor is installed on your
computer.

Every image-editing software program has its own system requirements and
capabilities. Study the software that comes with your camera or scanner. If
you feel that the program is too complicated (or doesn’t give you the editing
tools you need), investigate some of the other popular programs. You can
get some excellent shareware (software that you can try before you buy) at
www.tucows.com and www.shareware.com.
I used to be happy using Photoshop, but it’s a large and expensive program.
It’s also a bit of overkill for eBay images. Two other new programs have
caught my eye: Paint Shop Pro and Fast Photos.
Perfecting your picture in Paint Shop Pro
Paint Shop Pro by Jasc Software offers features that enable you to make a
good picture out of a bad one. It also has an awesome export-to-Web feature
that compresses the images so that they hold their quality while becoming
smaller. Images compressed in this fashion download a lot faster for dial-up
customers.
I’ve seen new packages of Paint Shop Pro 8.1 sell for as low as $50. Hint: Look
for listings in which Paint Shop is one word (Paintshop) in the title. You can go
to the manufacturer’s Web site at www.jasc.com and download a free trial.
After you evaluate the pictures you’ve taken for potential improvements
(see “Adding the Artist’s Touch,” you can get started with the actual editing
part of the process:
1. In the Paint Shop Pro program, choose File➪Open.
2. Select the Show Preview option (at the bottom of the Open dialog box).
3. Browse to find an image to open on your storage medium.
This can be a floppy disk (such as images from the Sony Mavica FD
series), a Memory Stick, a CompactFlash card, or an area on your hard
drive where you store your images.
Before you can select the correct image to edit, you have to get a look at
it, right?
4. Click the selected image file name so it appears in the File Name box
(as shown in Figure 4-1), and then click Open.
Your picture opens into the program. Note the Overview palette on the
page, consisting of a tiny preview of your picture and the Info tab.
5. Click the Info tab to see the specifications of your picture (as shown in
Figure 4-2).

6. If your image is sideways (as they often are), choose Image, select the
way you want the image rotated, and then click Rotate.
It’s so annoying to have sideways pictures on an item page — and so
many do!
7. Trim your picture as needed:
a. Click the crop tool.
The crop tool is on the left side of the screen, as shown in Figure 4-3.
b. Click your cursor where you’d like the new corner of your picture
to be, and hold your mouse button down as you drag the cursor to
the far corner of your selected area. Release the mouse button.
As you do so, the crop tool draws a rectangle over the area.
c. If you want to adjust your cropping area, click and drag an edge or
corner handle to adjust the rectangle’s size.
d. When you’re satisfied with the cropping, double-click the image.
Poof! It crops itself and appears at your new size, as shown in Fig-
ure 4-4.

8. If you feel that the color of your image isn’t vibrant enough or is too
dark, adjust the brightness and contrast as follows:
a. Choose Adjust➪Brightness and Contrast.
A window opens with a section of your image repeated twice.
Brightness and Contrast boxes appear below your image.
b. Click the Brightness up arrow to brighten the picture or click the
down arrow to darken the picture. Do the same with the Contrast
arrows.
You are presented with a preview of what your image will look like
before you click OK, as shown in Figure 4-5.
c. When you’re happy with the image results, click OK.
9. If your picture is too large for your eBay listing, do the following:
a. Choose Image➪Resize.
b. In the Pixel Dimensions area, change the drop-down list from
Percent to Pixels (see Figure 4-6) and then type a pixel size that
suits your auctions.
Keep the largest number no higher than approximately 400 pixels.
c. Click OK.
Your image is changed to the desired size.

At this point, it might be nice to check how your image will look in a Web
browser:
1. Choose View➪Preview in Web Browser.
The Preview in Web Browser dialog box appears.
2. Choose JPG➪Preview.
The JPEG Optimizer appears.
If you don’t want to preview and control your picture in the Web browser,
you can optimize your JPEG automatically when you save the image.
3. Click the Download Times tab to see how long it would take the image
to download at different Internet-connection speeds.
The program shows you both compressed and uncompressed versions
of the image file size. In Figure 4-7, it’s clear that my image’s file size is
too big (and will take too long to load) for use on eBay.
4. Click the Quality tab, and set the Compression Value higher.
A higher number compresses the image file size. In the window on the
right, you can see the effect of the compression. The original image is on
the left for comparison.

5. When you’re happy that you’ve compressed the picture all you can
without doing too much damage to it, click OK.
The image appears in your Web browser with statistics on loading times,
as shown in Figure 4-8.
6. Save the picture.
To do so, choose File➪Save As. Select the location where you want to
save your picture, give it a name, and click Save.
After you go through this process a few times, you’ll find that it takes only a
few minutes to prepare an eBay picture!
Quick touchup and FTP in Fast Photos
If Paint Shop Pro is too expensive and complex, you might be happy giving
Fast Photos by Pixby Software a try. It’s a simple, all-in-one photo-editing
program designed especially for e-commerce and eBay sellers. The devel-
oper of the software knew exactly what processes online sellers need for
their images and included just those — and nothing else. There are tools for
cropping, JPEG compression, sharpening, resizing, enhancing, rotating, and
adding watermark text and borders.

I said that Fast Photos is all-in-one because it not only allows you to touch
up your images quickly, but also has a built-in FTP program so that you can
upload your images immediately after editing them.
Editing an image for eBay in Fast Photos is simple:
1. Open the program.
2. Click Browse and find the directory containing your image.
3. Find the photo, click it (see Figure 4-9), and then click the Add to Tray
button (near the top of the screen).
4. Choose Edit.
5. Click to perform any of the following tasks, as shown in Figure 4-10:
• Rotate: If you’ve shot your picture sideways or upside down, you can
rotate it here.

• Crop: In crop mode, a gray rectangle appears with corner dots. Click
a corner dot, drag the rectangle until it closes in on your item, and
then click Apply.
• Enhance: Brighten, darken, increase, or decrease the contrast and
work with image gamma and color. Don’t worry, everything you do is
visible on the screen and can be undone if you mess things up.
• Resize: You can resize your image to the standard eBay sizes or
make the image a custom size.
• Sharpen: Is your image a little fuzzy? Click here to bring out the
details.
• Add border: If you want a border or a drop shadow on your image,
you can apply it here.
• Add text: Type your user ID so that you can watermark your images
(which dissuades those who try to use your images as their own).
• JPEG compress: By moving a sliding bar, you can compress the image
as much as you dare. The more you compress, the less detailed the
image will be.

• Create gallery thumbnail: You can create a perfect 192 x 192 thumb-
nail of your image on a white background for use in the gallery.
6. To save the changes you’ve made to your image, click Save As and
give your file a name.
Now you can upload your newly edited image to the Web. Just choose
Publish (on the toolbar).
To set up an FTP account for uploading, click the Add button on the Publish
screen. The screen shown in Figure 4-11 appears. Input the data required for
your FTP server, click OK, and then upload your image with a mouse click.
As I write this, the developer is adding a batch mode to the program so that
groups of images can be edited and uploaded at once. Check out Chapter 5
for more information on uploading your images.

A
fter you get your image perfect (following the suggestions in Chapter
4), it’s time to emblazon it on your auction for all the world to see.
When most people first get the urge to dazzle prospective buyers with a 
picture, they poke around the eBay site looking for a place to put it. Trade
secret: You’re not actually putting pictures on eBay; you’re telling eBay’s
servers where to find your picture so that, like a good hunting dog, your
auction points the buyers’ browsers to the exact corner of the virtual uni-
verse where your picture is. That’s why the picture has to load fast — it’s
coming in from a different location. (Yeah, it confused me in the beginning
too, but now it makes perfect sense. Uh-huh. Sure.)
Finding a Home for Your Pictures
Because your image needs an address, you have to find it a good home
online. You have several options:
✦Your ISP (Internet service provider): All the big ISPs — AOL, AT&T,
Road Runner, and Earthlink — give you space to store your Internet
stuff. You’re already paying for an ISP, so you can park pictures there
at no extra charge.
✦An image-hosting Web site: Web sites that specialize in hosting pictures
are popping up all over the Internet. Some charge a small fee; others are
free. The upside here is that they’re easy to use.
✦Your server: If you have your own server (those of you who do know
who you are), you can store those images in your own home.

Using eBay’s Picture Services
506
✦eBay Picture Services and Picture Manager: These are eBay-based tools
that host your photo on eBay’s servers for a fee. (You may upload one
image per listing at no charge.)
To most users, uploading pictures to their own Web space at their ISP remains
a mystery. Many users are still convinced that they have to pay for an image-
hosting service — but that’s rarely the case these days.
Using eBay’s Picture Services
I highly recommend that your first move be to take advantage of the one free
picture per listing from eBay’s Picture Services. First, it’s available at no
charge, and second, Picture Services offers many other benefits.
At this point, I’ll go back to my basic assumptions about you. I assume you
know how to list an item on eBay — or at the very least, you can make your
way through the Sell Your Item form and get to the Add Pictures step.
Once you arrive there, you need to upload a picture to eBay, whether or not
you have pictures in your description. Why? Because the first picture is free
(and why turn down anything free), and because your uploaded picture
becomes part of the ultraimportant top area of the item page, as shown in
Figure 5-1. This picture will also be the default picture for use as your all-
important gallery image.
Have you ever noticed that some items that you browse on eBay do not have
this crucial picture at the top? That’s a shame, because these sellers are not

availing themselves of eBay’s Picture Services and they’re losing sales as a
result. Having that picture at the top of the page is a first-rate way to pull a
buyer into your listing. (And did I mention that it’s free?)
I suggest that you use eBay Picture Services for your primary image but host
other images of the item elsewhere. Why? Because the quality of your photos
is better if you host them directly from a site. Really clear pictures on Picture
Services are few and far between. Picture Services reformats your photo to
fit in a layout 400 pixels wide by 300 pixels tall and then compresses the
file for quick viewing. This process can destroy the quality of your carefully
photographed images if you haven’t saved them in a compatible size. You’re
running a business, so be businesslike and use the method that presents your
photos in their best light.
Uploading your picture
In this section, I assume that you’ve already taken a picture, uploaded or
scanned it, and saved it somewhere on your computer’s hard drive.
For organization’s sake, you might consider making a subfolder in your My
Pictures directory called eBay Photos. That way you can always find your
eBay pictures quickly, without searching through photos of your family
reunion.
eBay offers two versions of Picture Services. The basic version, which is
shown in Figure 5-2, allows you to upload eBay-ready images as they appear
on your computer. If you want to rotate or crop the picture, you need
advanced Picture Services. You’ll be using the advanced version in the steps
that follow.

When you reach the part of the Sell Your Item form that allows you to add
pictures, does the screen look like Figure 5-2? If so, scroll down and click
the Upgrade to our free full-featured version link. This sends you to eBay’s
advanced Picture Services screen, which is shown in Figure 5-3.
If you’ve never used eBay’s advanced Picture Services before, a Windows
security warning pops up, asking your permission to install a small program
on your computer, as shown in Figure 5-4. This is safe (and the only way you
can use eBay’s Picture Services features), so click Yes.

Then, to upload your picture, follow these steps:
1. In the advanced Picture Services screen (refer to Figure 5-3), click the
Add Pictures button.
A window pops up, prompting you to open an image file on your 
computer.
2. Navigate to the directory that holds your eBay images on your 
computer.
3. Click the image in the browsing window.
The image name appears in the filename box.
4. Click the Open box.
The selected image appears in the picture frame.
5. To rotate the image, click the circular arrow (at the upper right of the
main image box).
6. To crop the image:
a. Click the crop box in the right corner of the larger image.
Two squares appear at opposite corners of your main image.
b. Click the frame on the outside of your image, and move the bar
until the offensive area is cropped out.
You can do this from the sides, top, and bottom of the picture.
7. When you’re finished, click Continue.
A pop-up window notifies you that your picture is being uploaded to
eBay’s picture server.
Sometimes Picture Services will shrink your image to a too-small size, but
you can’t do much about it. Just be sure to reload the image anytime you
relist the item; otherwise, the gallery image may just get smaller and smaller.
eBay continues to improve Picture Services, so don’t give up on it. Use it for
the free image, and be sure to upload secondary images from an outside site.
If you accidentally select the wrong picture, click the X in the lower-left
corner to make the picture disappear so you can select a different one.
Understanding the costs
You may notice that you have the option to upload more pictures. eBay
charges for the additional images (see Table 5-1). You can include more images
at no extra cost by uploading them from a server (more on that later).

stand out (and the expenditure is within your budget), you can’t get a better
bang for your for 35 cents.
Using Your Free ISP Space
In this section, I show you some easy ways to upload your pictures to your
Web site or to your ISP’s Web space. Doing so means you don’t incur extra
fees from eBay for including multiple pictures in your listings.
Everyone who connects to the Internet from his or her computer has an
Internet service provider, or ISP. You pay this company a monthly fee for the
privilege of hooking up to the Internet using their servers. AT&T Worldnet,
Earthlink, Road Runner, AOL, or a local provider in your area are examples
of ISPs.
Many of these ISPs give you a minimum of 5MB of space to put a personal
home page on the Internet. You can usually store your images for your eBay
sales there — unless your provider has some strict rules about not doing
that (it’s a good idea to check first).
Internet providers may supply you with an image upload area, but they may
require you to use File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to upload your images. You
may be able to find a free or shareware (requiring a small fee) FTP program
on sites such as the following:

If you use the Fast Photos image-editing program (described in Chapter 4),
you get an FTP program as part of the software at no extra charge!
I’ve been using CuteFTP for years because it’s easy to use and reliable. (I also
use the CuteHTML design program, as I describe in Chapter 3. You can pur-
chase CuteFTP in a software bundle with CuteHTML.) CuteFTP has never given

Uploading Images to AOL
AOL handles image uploads a bit differently from other ISPs. (But those of
you on AOL knew that already.) Many people love AOL because it provides
an easy, step-by-step interface. As you probably imagine, uploading pictures
is handled in that same AOL style.
To upload pictures to AOL, follow these steps:
1. Sign on to your AOL account.
2. Display the FTP area of AOL:
For users of AOL 5.0: Select Keywords, type my ftp space in the
text line, and click GO.
For users of later versions of AOL: Search keywords for ftp-click
go by typing it in the text line. On the next page, click members ftp
space. Then double-click members.aol.com.
3. Click See My FTP Space.
You’re sent to your AOL storage area.
4. Click Upload.
A screen appears so you can name the file you want to upload, called
the remote file.

5. In the Remote Filename box (see Figure 5-8), enter a name for your
picture.
Use all lowercase letters and no more than eight characters.
6. Click Continue.
A window opens so that you can locate the file on your computer, as
shown in Figure 5-9.

7. Locate the file, click its filename, and then click Open.
Your file will whiz through the wires to the server at AOL, as shown in
Figure 5-10.
You can now double-check that your file arrived safely by typing its URL in
your browser as follows, and pressing Enter:
http://members.aol.com/yourscreenname/picturename.jpg
You use the URL when you insert the picture into your eBay item descrip-
tion, as follows
<img src= http://members.aol.com/yourscreenname/picturename.jpg>
Using eBay’s Picture Manager
If you really can’t find a place to host your own pictures, you can store them
with eBay’s Picture Manager. Go to your My eBay page, and click the Picture
Manager link. The screen shown in Figure 5-11 appears.
Figure 5-11:

In the Picture Manager, you see any pictures you have uploaded, plus four
buttons:
✦Add/Upload: Click this button to display the basic uploader. (More on
the basic and full-featured uploaders in a minute.)
✦Web Links: When you put a check mark in the corner of one of the images
and click the Web Links button, you are presented with the HTML code
to copy and paste into your auction description, as shown in Figure 5-12.
You can get HTML code for three picture sizes:
Standard: 400 x 300 (bottom of the page size)
Header: 200 x 150 (header image size)
Thumbnail: 96 x 72 (gallery size)
✦Move: Move a picture into another folder.
✦Rename: If you don’t like the name your camera gave the picture, you
can rename the image here.
Two upload screens are available: basic and full-featured. The basic uploader
screen, which is shown in Figure 5-13, appears when you click the Add/Upload
button on the Picture Manager screen. The basic screen uploads your pictures
one at a time, as in the basic Picture Services.
To see the full-featured uploader, click the Try the faster full-featured Uploader
for free! link on the basic uploader screen. The screen shown in Figure 5-14
appears. The full-featured version works the same way as the advanced ver-
sion of Picture Services.

In the Upload window, you have a few additional options:
✦Optimal picture size: Remember that eBay optimizes your pictures
for faster display, which may affect the quality of the image. You can
have eBay upload a copy of your original picture along with the opti-
mized version.
✦Picture watermark: You can add a watermark with your user ID (up
to 24 characters) or the eBay Picture Services logo. The watermark
makes it more difficult for someone to lift your auction images.
✦Upload to: If you set up separate folders in Picture Manager, you may
select which folder you want to upload your images to.
If you have an eBay store, you get 1MB of storage space for free. That’s enough
for about 40 pictures! If you don’t have a store, you have to pay a fee to use
this service. See Table 5-2 for eBay’s current charges for this service.

Chapter 1: Marketing Your
Listings on eBay
In This Chapter
 Bidding for clickthroughs
 Designing a banner to rival the big guys
 Setting up your banner with eBay
W
hile browsing on eBay one day, I noticed banner ads at the top of the
Search pages. What surprised me most was that the banners did not
always advertise some huge, mega-corporation such as Home and Garden
TV, Toyota, or Stanley Tools. Instead, they highlighted little guys with eBay
stores like mine!
Just as I assumed that these banner ads were reserved for the high and
mighty, I also assumed that they must be expensive. But they’re quite rea-
sonably priced and easily within the eBay seller’s budget!
These banners, just as with Google AdWords (see Chapter 3), are based on
keyword searches, and link to your eBay store or to particular items in your
store. The name of the game here is clickthroughs: How many people can
you get to click your banner and buy your goods? Read this chapter and find
out how easy it is to become a “big guy” with your banner flying on eBay.
Getting the Clickthroughs
Probably close to a hundred million people use eBay’s search engine every
day and hope that the search terms they use help them find the goods they
want. When you have listings in the same genre that the search terms
describe, your items get matched with the search. But even better, you can
direct searchers to your listings by paying eBay to display your advertising
banner at the top of the matching search page, as shown in Figure 1-1. Notice
also, that aside from your banner ad, eBay Keywords serves up two small
text ads next to it. That way you get double exposure!
This magic is performed with keywords; the same keywords that I discuss in
Chapter 3. This type of advertising works out financially only if you’re sell-
ing several items that fall under the same group of keywords. For example,

Getting the Clickthroughs
522
suppose you have several related items with keywords such as For Dummies.
Your ad is served to the eBay page in response to search terms such as eBay
Timesaving Techniques For Dummies that match your keywords or keyword
phrases.
You need to know just a few facts to get started:
✦eBay’s Marketplace (which controls the banner ads) is a cost-per-click
network, just like Google AdWords. But placing a banner ad for eBay key-
word advertising isn’t as expensive as you might think:
✦You pay nothing for the banner to appear. Remember, you pay only if
your ad gets clicked.
✦You control how much you pay for a banner clickthrough by placing a
ceiling on the amount you want to pay.
Here’s the trick to keyword advertising. Those who bid the highest tend to
have their ads prioritized first. So the higher your bid for the ad, the higher
you’re ranked in the ad rotation for the specified keywords. This means your
banner ad will potentially appear on the search results page more often than
the ad for your competitor who bid less.
Bidding for placement starts at $.10, and increases by increments of $.01. 
I show you how the bidding works in the “Setting Up a Banner Campaign” 
section.

Making Your Banner
So that you don’t put the cart before the horse, it’s best to decide what you
would like your banner to say to potential buyers before you hire someone
to design the banner.
If you’re spending time and money on a banner ad, make sure you target a
specific item. A general banner relaying only the message “Shop from me”
isn’t going to get you a lot of clicks. A specific banner telling readers that you
offer “The Wildest Widgets on the Web” has a better chance of getting a little
mouse action. The idea of the campaign is to get people to click your banner
and thereby find your sales.
eBay Keywords inserts a plain banner ad for you (as shown in Figure 1-2) if
you don’t insert a professionally prepared one. Compare this banner to the
one in Figure 1-1 and tell me which banner will attract more attention.
On a sheet of paper, write down all the words you can think of that relate to
your item. Do you have an image you’d like in the banner? Pull together all
the resources you have so you can decide on your banner’s look as well.
With everything assembled, you can start reviewing the options for creating
your banner.
eBay’s Keywords advertising program has a simple online tool for creating
banners, and I’m sure you’ve seen the resulting banners on eBay. They all
look much the same and thereby lack a polished, professional image. If
you’re trying to develop your own brand and be in business for real, you
need to create a custom banner.
If you’re one of those creative sorts and have some extra time, you can easily
create your own custom banner. If you don’t have the time or inclination to sit
down and design a banner, a custom banner needn’t be expensive. Plenty of
sharp graphic designers sell custom banners on eBay. These designers work
from the information you assemble, and they produce a banner within a few
days, so it’s not long before you can start your campaign.
Figure 1-2:
The default
freebie

Keywords.

Making Your Banner
524
All you have to do is search the eBay site (see the upcoming search term
list) and look at the designers’ listings. See which artist creates the type of
banners you like. Be sure you’re happy with his or her terms of sale and
verify that the artist’s time schedule will meet yours. Of course, read the
feedback. On a graphic artist’s work, the feedback will be especially telling.
Here are some search terms to use:
✦animated banner
✦eBay banner
✦banner design
Figure 1-3 shows the results of such a search.
Banner graphics are designed in many different sizes (yes, I know they all
look the same, but they’re not). Whether you’re designing your own or con-
tracting with a designer, be sure to match these specifications:
✦Banner size: 468 x 60 pixels.
✦Format: GIF.
✦Animation: No aggressive animation. It should not be excessively fast,
long, or strobelike. (These traits make for an annoying, unproductive
banner anyway!)

✦Maximum file size: 12K.
✦Border: Must be nonwhite.
✦Banner text: Must be relevant to what you’re selling. No keyword spam-
ming! Banner text also may not contain phone numbers, URLs, or e-mail
information.
Setting Up a Banner Campaign
When you go to set up your campaign, be prepared with some keywords.
The keywords you use for your advertising need not be as precise as the
keywords you use to search on eBay. Write down all possible keywords that
might possibly relate to your item; you’re allowed a long list. (Later I show
you how to narrow it down.) After your program starts, you’ll be able to see
which searches net you the most hits.
Keep to these guidelines when making up your list:
✦Use key phrases versus keywords. Key phrases can be made up of two
or three words, like craftsman hammer or eBay For Dummies. By using
key phrases, your banner ad can achieve a closer match to the prospec-
tive buyer’s search.
✦Be sure the keywords relate to your item.
✦Avoid overused and over-general keywords. eBay will reject your 
keywords if you use the ever-popular title words wow, cool, super, nice,
or new.
✦Don’t use apostrophes, special characters, or repeated periods.
Signing up
To get moving with your campaign, click the Services link above the eBay navi-
gation bar and scroll down the page to the Advanced Seller Recommendations
area. Click the eBay Keywords link. Alternatively, you can go directly to www.
eBayKeywords.com.
Scout around the page you land on and look for any first-time user or intro-
ductory discount. I always hate it when I sign up for something and later find
out I could have received a discount!
After you’ve secured any discount or promo code, click the New Users
button and enter the site. You’ll need to go through several steps to begin
your campaign:

Setting Up a Banner Campaign
526
1. Sign in with your eBay user ID, as shown in Figure 1-4.
This is how the keywords people can match you up with your listings or
your eBay store.
2. In the Promo Code box, type the promotional code you found on the
front page.
If you found a promo code, a dollar amount automatically appears in
the Total Funds text box. If you didn’t find one, go to the next step and
invest as little cash as you want.
3. In the Campaign Funds box, type the amount you want to invest in
your banner campaign.
4. Click Create Ad to get going!
You can pause your campaign anytime you want and pick it up again when
you want. You can also change your banner during the campaign.
Playing the links
In the Create New Ad screen, you choose where your banner ad takes poten-
tial buyers when they click it. Figure 1-5 shows you where you make your
choices. Select the appropriate option to link your banner:
Figure 1-4:

✦To a Category Within My eBay Store: A category you’ve set up in your

✦To a Search Within My eBay Store: This sets up a link that searches for
preset search terms in your store.
✦To a Listing of All My Items: This links to a list of all your items, as they
appear when a seller search is performed.
✦To a Particular Item: This sets up a link to a particular item that you sell.
✦Select Where Your Ad Links To: You may also insert a link of your choice,
as long as it links to your eBay items.
Targeting with keywords and key phrases
Next, you type your keyword or key phrase list. You may also upload a CSV
text file, but why bother? Just cut and paste from your list, separating each
word or phrase by a comma.
When you’re finished typing, click Submit. Your keywords are uploaded and
reviewed for editorial correctness. Click OK when you see the confirmation
screen and continue to a fully populated keyword page.
Figure 1-5:

528
Bidding for exposure
Next you decide the maximum cost per click (CPC) that you want to pay.
After you click Proceed to Search Word Analysis (this is getting exciting,
isn’t it? Wow, real analysis!), you can enter your maximum bid and review
the potential effectiveness.
As you click each keyword, you will see tiny versions of your competition’s
banners for that particular keyword and how much they bid. You may adjust
your bids individually for each keyword.
The higher bid amount gets viewing priority, so if a keyword is especially
important to you, you might want to up your bid. Just remember to click
the keyword to evaluate your changes at each step.
You don’t always have to be in the number one (highest bidder) slot. I’m
ranked number three for one of my keywords. It’s a popular one, and my
little banner still gets close to 15,000 views per month. Remember that a 
zillion people are browsing eBay. You’re charged only when they click your
banner. Holding the number one slot for all your keywords will burn up your
budget in a hurry!
Bidding is handled as with eBay auctions, on a proxy basis. Even if you
select $.20 as your high bid, eBay Keywords will increase your bid by only
enough to put you $.01 ahead of the competition.
You will not always be paying the maximum you bid per click — just enough
to outbid the competition. eBay Keywords will let you know about your rank-
ing as you indicate your bid.
Each time a user clicks your banner, the bid amount is deducted from your
campaign fund. When the campaign money runs out, you’ll receive an e-mail
notifying you that you need to add funds. You may also choose an auto-renew
option, but that can easily get away from you. If you’re like me, you like to
know how much you’re spending and want to control when things are charged
to your account.
If a particular budget gets used up too quickly, consider waiting a week or so
before infusing more money. However, if your sales are going through the
roof, the expenditure is well worth the cost.
Uploading your banner
Uploading your banner is the easiest part of this long process. When you
arrive at the screen that specifies the banner size, follow these steps:

Book VI
Chapter 1
Marketing Your
Listings on eBay
Setting Up a Banner Campaign
529
1. Click the Browse button to find the GIF file that is your banner on
your computer’s hard drive.
2. Click the file, and your banner appears in the box on the screen.
3. Click the Proceed to banner upload link.
Your banner is uploaded to the Keywords server.
Now, all you have to do is view your campaign summary. When you’re fin-
ished, your keywords will be marked with a red Pending approval. Don’t have
a cow; this usually takes less than a day to be cleared. If the keywords are
not approved for any reason, you’ll receive an e-mail explaining why.
Paying for your campaign
Paying for your banner ad campaign is also easy. If you’ve entered a promo-
tion code, you have nothing to pay. But when you do have to ante up, eBay
accepts all credit cards as well as PayPal.
I recommend that you use the credit card you’ve set aside for your eBay
business. The charge will clearly show up on your credit card bill as eBay
Keywords advertising. If you allow eBay to debit your PayPal account
instead, you might cause problems with keeping track of your accounting.
(See Book IX for more about keeping your accounting records intact.)

Chapter 2: Developing 
Your Web Site
In This Chapter
 Finding free Web space
 Choosing a host
 Deciding on the perfect name
 Registering the perfect name
Your eBay store is important to your business, but it doesn’t replace an
e-commerce Web site. You should establish your own presence on the
Web. And although you should link your site to eBay, don’t miss out on the
rest of the Internet population.
You don’t have a Web site yet? The Web has so many sites with pictures of
people’s dogs and kids that I just assumed you had your own site, too. The
space for a Web site comes free from your ISP (I even have an embarrassing
one with family pictures). One of these sites can be the practice site for your
business. Take down pictures of the baby, and post pictures of items you’re
selling — or at the very least, install the eBay Merchant Kit (see Chapter 3).
You do have a Web site? Have you taken a good look at it lately to see
whether it’s up to date? (I just looked at mine — ugh.) Does it link to your
eBay auctions, eBay store, and the gallery?
Most small and medium businesses are increasing their online revenue. In
spring 2004, Interland, one of the leading Web-hosting providers, surveyed
some of their shared hosting customers to measure the barometer of
online activities. They found that 63% of respondents have five or fewer
employees — does that sound like you? Figure 2-1 shows how important
a Web site is to their businesses.
Whether or not you have a Web site, this chapter has something for you. I
provide a lot of detail about Web sites, from thinking up a name to choosing a
host. If you don’t have a site, I get you started launching one. If you already
have a site, read the pointers about finding the best host. For the serious-
minded Web-based entrepreneur (that’s you), I also include some important
marketing tips.

Free Web Space — a Good Place to Start
532
Free Web Space — a Good Place to Start
Although I love the word free, in real life it seems like nothing is really free.
Free generally means something won’t cost you too much money — but may
cost you a bit more in time. When your site is free, you can’t have your own
direct URL (Universal Resource Locator) or domain name. Most likely, a free
Web site has an address such as one of the following:
www.netcom.com/~marshac
home.socal.rr.com/marshac
members.aol.com/membername
Having some kind of site at least gives you experience in setting one up.
When you’re ready to jump in for real, you can always use your free site
as an extension of your main business site.
When you signed up for Internet access, you had to sign on with an Internet
service provider (ISP), which means you probably have your own Web space.
Take a look at Table 2-1, where I compare some popular ISPs.

*Yahoo! GeoCities isn’t an ISP, but it is a reliable online community that gives each member online Web
space. Membership is free. Extra megabyte space is available for purchase.
Most ISPs allow you to have more than one e-mail address per account. Each
e-mail address is entitled to a certain amount of free Web space. Through the
use of hyperlinks (small pieces of HTML code that, when clicked, route the
clicker from one place to another on the page or on another Web site), you
can combine all the free Web space from each e-mail address into one giant
Web site.
If America Online (AOL) is your Internet provider, you may already know
that AOL often has serious issues regarding its users getting e-mail from the
rest of the Internet. You can’t afford to run a business in an area that has
e-mail issues. Your AOL account gives each of your seven screen names 2MB
of online storage space. You can best utilize this space by using it to store
images for eBay, not to run a business site. Each screen name, at 2MB, can
store fifty 40K images. (For more information on how to use this space for
your extra images, see Book V.)
Many ISPs have their own page-builder (HTML-generating) program that’s
free to their users.
Poke around your ISP’s home page for a Community or Your Web space link.
For example, after poking around the RoadRunner ISP’s home page (www.
rr.com), I found and clicked the Member Services link, which led me to a page
offering various options. I finally found a Personal Home Page link, which took
me to a page that would walk me through setting up my own home page. After
agreeing to the terms of service, I can simply log on and set up my home page.
RoadRunner offered me the option of using Microsoft FrontPage, which is one
of the best and easiest Web-building programs around.

Paying for Your Web Space
534
I recommend FrontPage, but if you want all its benefits, you’ll need a site that
uses FrontPage extensions (portions of the FrontPage program that reside on
the server and enable all the HTML magic to happen automatically). Installing
Microsoft FrontPage extensions on a small Web site like the one that Road-
Runner provides will take up too many of your precious megabytes). (Yahoo!,
however, has them installed for the GeoCities sites, and doesn’t count them as
part of your allotted megabyte count.) Save FrontPage extensions for hosted
Web sites (the ones you pay for) when you have a good deal of allotted space.
In lieu of getting involved in a huge (and expensive) program such as
FrontPage, you might want to consider using a quick and easy HTML gener-
ator such as CuteHTML. If you’re not looking to get extra fancy, this is the
program for you. I often use CuteHTML to put together my eBay auctions
when I use tables (to put pictures next to my text). You can download a free
trial; the price to buy the program is only $19.99. You can find CuteHTML
on the GlobalSCAPE Web site at
www.globalscape.com/o/914
If your ISP offers FTP (File Transfer Protocol), use it to upload your pages
and images. You can still design pages in Microsoft FrontPage — just don’t
use the fancy features. If your ISP doesn’t supply an FTP program for you, go
to the following and download a free trial of CuteFTP:
www.globalscape.com/o/912
CuteFTP is a small, simple program that will help you get your pages and
images to your site.
Your first Web pages may be simple, and that’s okay. You have to get used to
having a Web site before you can really use it for commerce. Put up a home
page that links to a few product-related pages and your eBay auctions, and,
voila, you’re in business. If you’re feeling more adventurous about your Web
site, check out the next section, where I describe a handful of Web site hosts.
Paying for Your Web Space
If you’ve been on the Internet for any length of time, you’ve been bombarded
by hosting offers through your daily spam. A Web-hosting company houses
your Web site code and electronically doles out your pages and images to
Web page visitors.
If you take advantage of PayPal’s free Pay Now buttons or shopping cart, you
can turn a basic-level hosted site into a full-on e-commerce store without
paying additional fees to your hosting company. The PayPal tools are easily
inserted into your pages with a snippet of code provided by PayPal.

Chapter 2

Web Site
Paying for Your Web Space
535
Before deciding to spend good money on a Web-hosting company, check it
out thoroughly. Go to that company’s site to find a list of features they offer.
If you still have questions after perusing the Web site, look for a toll-free
number to call. You won’t find any feedback ratings like you find on eBay,
but the following are a few questions to ask (don’t hang up until you’re satis-
fied with the answers):
✦How long have they been in business? You don’t want a Web host that
has been in business only a few months and operates out of their base-
ment. Deal with someone who’s been around the Internet for a while
and, hence, knows what they’re doing. Is the company’s Web site profes-
sional looking? Does the company look like it has enough money to stay
in business?
✦Who are some of their other clients? Poke around to see whether you
can find links to sites of other clients. Take a look at who else is doing
business with them and analyze the sites. Do the pages and links come
up quickly? Do all the images appear in a timely manner? Web sites that
load quickly are a good sign.
✦What is their downtime-to-uptime ratio? Does the Web host guarantee
uptime (the span of time its servers stay operational without going down
and denying access to your site)? Expecting a 99% uptime guarantee is
not unreasonable; you’re open for business — and your Web host needs
to keep it that way.
✦How much Web space do you get for my money? MSN (Microsoft
Network Internet access service) gives you 30MB for free; you’d better
be getting a whole lot more if you’re paying for it!
✦What’s their data transfer limit? Data transfer is a measurement of the
amount of bytes transferred from your site on the server to the Internet.
In July 2001, my site had 93,000 hits; in July 2004, it had more than
500,000. Each hit transfers a certain amount of bytes from your host’s
servers to the viewer’s computer.
✦Do they offer toll-free technical support? When something goes wrong
with your Web site, you need it corrected immediately. You must be able
to reach tech support quickly without hanging around on the phone for
hours. Does the Web host have a technical support area on its Web site
where you can troubleshoot your own problems (in the middle of the
night)?
Whenever you’re deciding on any kind of provider for your business,
take a moment to call their tech support team with a question about
their services. Take note of how long you had to hold and how courte-
ous the techs were. Before plunking down your hard-earned money, you
should be sure that the provider’s customer service claims aren’t merely
that — just claims.

✦What’s the policy on shopping carts? In time you’re probably going to
need a shopping cart interface on your site. Does your provider charge
extra for that? If so, how much? In the beginning, a convenient and 
professional-looking way to sell items on your site is to set up a PayPal
shopping cart or PayPal Pay Now buttons. When you’re running your
business full-time, however, a shopping cart or a way to accept credit
cards is a must.
✦What kind of statistics will you get? Visitors who go to your Web site
leave a bread-crumb trail. Your host collects these statistics, so you’ll
be able to know which are your most and least popular pages. You can
know how long people linger on each page, where they come from, and
what browsers they’re using. How your host supplies these stats to you
is important. One of the best reporting formats is provided from a com-
pany called WebTrends (www.webtrends.com).
✦Are there any hidden fees? Are they charging exorbitant fees for setup?
Charging extra for statistics? Imposing high charges if your bandwidth
suddenly increases?
✦How often will the Web host back up your site? No matter how redun-
dant a host’s servers are, a disaster may strike and you need to know
that your Web site won’t vaporize. Redundancy is the safety net for your
site. Ask how many power backups a company has for the main system.
Perhaps it has generators (more than one is good) and more.
If you have a Web site and you’re like me, you’re always looking for other
hosts that offer more bang for your buck. It takes time to look behind the
glitzy promotional statements and find out the facts behind each company.
Go to www.tophosts.com and click the link to their current top Web hosts.
You might want to also check out www.webhostdir.com/webhostawards.
They check out Web-hosting companies and update their rankings monthly.
Take a look at who’s listed and then go to check out the host’s own Web
site.
Table 2-2 provides a comparison of some host service costs. In the rest of
this section, I fill you in on the details about the four Web-hosting companies
listed in the table. Make sure you check out their Web sites, however, to get
the most current information.
Keep in mind that 200MB disk storage space can host as many as 6000 HTML
pages.

ReadyHosting
ReadyHosting is a little guy who’s worked hard. The company has been host-
ing Web space since June 2000 and is a C-net Certified Award Winner. More
than 150 new sites sign up with the service each day. Sites are hosted on
servers running state-of-the-art software, and each site comes with a Cart32
e-commerce shopping cart. (Cart32 integrates directly into Microsoft
FrontPage, holds inventory, validates credit cards, and more.) For details,
check out
www.readyhosting.com
Interland 
Interland is a big company with big sophisticated equipment, and it hosts a
bunch of the big guys on their own private servers. They’ve been in the host-
ing business since 1995 and host sites for more than 4 million small and
medium-sized businesses.
For little guys, Interland offers shared hosting, and that’s probably what you’ll
be using for quite a while. With shared hosting, your site resides with others
on a single server, sharing all resources.
If your Internet sales gross more than $100,000 a year, you might have to
look into dedicated hosting, in which your site is on a server of its own and
ismanaged by the technical experts at your hosting company.
One of the best features of the company is its 24/7 toll-free technical sup-
port: Its online support gives extensive advice on how to solve problems
on your own. Check out this site at the following address:

Microsoft Small Business Center
If Interland is big, Microsoft is gargantuan; it’s the leader in everything
related to personal computing (as if you didn’t know that). To grab a piece of
the e-commerce market, Microsoft is making a strong push with its improved
Small Business Center (formerly bCentral) site, which has always been a
home for business Internet utilities and has now come full circle to hosting
Web sites and promoting e-commerce.
Availing yourself of their Web hosting is an easy procedure. You can find out
the details of their current offerings at
http://www.microsoft.com/smallbusiness/
Small Business Center FTP’s your pages through the use of Microsoft
FrontPage (must be purchased separately). Design your own pages in
FrontPage and take advantage of the many promotional and commerce-
enabled options offered on the site.
For an additional $24.95, you can apply Commerce Manager to your Small
Business Center Web site or any FrontPage-enabled Web site for a full 
e-commerce enabled storefront.
Small Business Center also has a Traffic Builder program for banner adver-
tising on the LinkExchange network. Banner ad campaign prices range from
$50 to $500. Rates rise as you target your advertising and specify where you
want the ad to appear.
Design help and hosting
Interland offers many levels of entry. There’s
the basic do-it-yourself package listed in Table
2-2, but they also offer the services of their
crack team of professional Web designers to
help you get up and running. It always helps to
have the assistance of a professional when
you’re just starting out.
They give you the use of their own FTP service
and an online easy-to-use WYSIWYG Web site
Content Manager (so you don’t have to invest
in extra software). You can add all the pages
you want to your professionally formatted site.
To get a clear idea of the type of custom
designs they’ve produced for small businesses,
check out the more than 300 Web sites they’ve
designed at
www.youreallycan.com
Their beginning Web Site Express package
includes online training with one of their
experts and a three-page, custom-designed
starter site. (You can build an unlimited number
of your own pages from there.) The package
costs only $19.95 a month with a $299.99 one-
time setup fee. This is an economical and pro-
fessional way to get your online empire started.

Yahoo! Web site services
Yahoo! is trying to do a little bit of everything these days. I’m never sure
which direction it’s going. Yahoo! took over GeoCities (one of the original
free Web site hosts) a few years back, so my family Web site became a free
Yahoo! site. Considering that I have a free site, I must admit that the services
that Yahoo! offers have been top-drawer, disproving the notion that you get
what you pay for. But then again, I’m not running a business from the site;
it’s just a bunch of family pictures.
When you subscribe to one of Yahoo!’s Web-hosting plans, you can down-
load their free SiteBuilder software, which allows you to be up and running
with the basic site quickly. Thank goodness you don’t have to know any
HTML to use it. The download includes access to more than 300 stock tem-
plates that you can customize any way you want. If you don’t want to use
SiteBuilder, you can use good old Microsoft FrontPage to design your site.
If you’re looking for a store solution, you can subscribe to a do-it-yourself, 
e-commerce, full-featured site for $39.95 a month. This site includes product
merchandising templates, order-management systems, and more. Check out
their award-winning offerings at
smallbusiness.yahoo.com
Naming Your Baby
What to name the baby, er, Web site? It’s almost as much of a dilemma as
deciding on your eBay user ID or eBay store name. If you don’t have an exist-
ing company name that you want to use, why not use the same name as your
eBay store? Register and lock it up now so that you can keep your brand 
forever.
Name your site with a word that identifies what you do, what you sell, or
who you are. And be sure you like it, because once its yours and you begin
operating under it and establishing a reputation, it’ll be with you 20 years
from now when you’re still selling online! (I know, it should only happen!)
A few Web sites offer wizards to help you decide your domain name. A par-
ticularly intuitive one can be found at the following:
www.namesarecheap.com/wizard.shtml
In a small, Web-based form, you input your primary business type and key-
words that describe your business. The wizard then displays a large number
of options and also lets you know whether the options are available. Very
convenient.

Registering Your Domain Name
540
Before you attempt to register a name, you should check to be sure it isn’t
anyone else’s trademark. To search an updated list of registered United
States trademarks, go to the following and use the electronic trademark
search system:
www.trademarksearchforfree.com
After a search, you may want to trademark your site name. NameProtect.
com is an online service that can help you with that. It offers online trade-
mark applications and also refers you to an attorney if you’d like to use one;
just go to their site for further information.
Registering Your Domain Name
Talk about your junk e-mail. I get daily e-mails advising me to Lose 40
pounds in 40 days, accept credit cards now, and of course REGISTER
MY NAME NOW! The last scam seems to be geared to obtaining my e-mail
address for other junk mail lists rather than trying to help me register my
Web site. Choosing a select registrar (the company that handles the register-
ing of your site name) is as important as choosing the right Web host. You
must remember that the Internet is still a little like the Wild West, and that
the James Gang might be waiting to relieve you of your hard-earned cash.
One of the ways to protect yourself is to understand how the registry works
(knowledge is power), so read on.
Before you decide on a registrar for your domain name, take a minute to
see whether the registrar is accredited by ICANN (Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers — the international governing body for domain
names) or is reselling for an official ICANN-accredited registrar. (You’ll have to
ask who they register with.) The Accredited Registrar Directory is updated
constantly, so check the following for the most recent list:
www.internic.com/regist.html.
Domain parking
Suppose that you’ve come up with a brilliant
name for your site and you get really big and
famous. Then someone else uses your Web
site name but registers it as a .net — while
yours is a .com. To avoid this situation, make
sure you register both domains (.com and .net)
and park them with your registrar. That way,
any permutations of your domain will point to
your active Web site. For example, www.
ebay.net and www.ebay.org are registered
to (guess who?) ebay.com. You can check 
the owner of any domain name at any of the
Web-hosting or registrar sites.

You’ll usually get a substantial discount from the more expensive registrars
when you register your domain name for multiple years — a good idea if you
plan on staying in business. Also, if you register your name through your
hosting service, you might be able to cut the prices in Table 2-3 in half! The
only drawback is that your prepaid registration might go out the window if
you choose to change hosting companies.
If you’re registering a new domain name but already have a site set up with
your ISP, you need a feature called URL forwarding, or Web address forwarding.
This feature directs any hits to your new domain name from your existing
long URL address. Some registrars offer this service, but watch out for hidden
surprises, such as a free offer of the service, which means they will probably
smack a big fat banner at the bottom of your home page. Your registrar should
also have some available tech support. Trying to troubleshoot DNS issues is
a job for those who know what they’re doing! Remember, sometimes you get
what you pay for.
Making your personal information private
ICANN requires every registrar to maintain a
publicly accessible whois database displaying
all contact information for all domain names
registered. Interested parties (or fraudsters)
can find out the name, street address, e-mail
address, and phone number of the owner of the
site by running a whois search on the domain
name. You can run a whois search by going to
www.whois.net and typing the domain name
in question.
This information can be useful to spammers
who spoof your e-mail address as their return
address to cloak their identity, identity thieves,
stalkers, and just about anyone up to no good.
To see the difference between private and
public registrations, run a whois search on my
Web site, www.coolebaytools.com, which
is private, and www.ebay.com, which is public.
Registrars such as Network Solutions offer pri-
vate registration for an additional $9 a year.
Check to see whether your registrar offers this
service. For updated information on private reg-
istration, visit my Web site.

 Installing eBay Marketplace
A
fter you set up your Web site and eBay store, it’s time to let the world
know about it. Having spent many years in the advertising business, I
can spot businesses that want to fail. They open their doors and expect the
world to beat a path to them and make them rich. This doesn’t happen —
ever.
You must take an active approach to letting the world in on the goodies you
have for sale. This means spending a good deal of time promoting your site
by running banner ads and getting your URL into a search engine. There are
no shortcuts.
About a trillion (at least!) people out there want to take your money for
advertising your Web site. There are affiliate programs, link exchanges,
banner exchanges — the list just goes on! As with all transactions regarding
your Web site, knowing who you’re dealing with is key. If you want to run your
banner on someone else’s site, don’t spend money; ask to do an exchange.
The more advertising that you can get for free, the better. If you decide that
you want to pay for advertising, I recommend that you wait until after you’ve
made a profit selling merchandise from your site. 
A simple link to your Web site from your eBay About Me page will draw
people to your site initially. You’ll be pleasantly surprised.

Banner Ad Exchanges
544
Banner Ad Exchanges
The way banner ad exchange services work is simple. First, you design a
banner ad in your graphics program to a designated size according to the
following standards:
✦468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high
✦GIF format (no JPEGs)
✦Nontransparent
✦File size less than 10K (10,240 bytes) 
✦If animated, the animation stops at seven seconds and doesn’t include
loops
The service displays the banner on other sites. When Web surfers click your
banner, they’re taken to your site, where they’ll see all the great stuff you
have for sale. You can even target what type of sites you want your banner to
appear on as well. Remember that this is an exchange. Someone else’s banner
will appear on your pages in exchange for showing yours on other sites.
Banner design
If you think that designing an eye-catching banner ad is beyond your graphic
talents, you’ll be happy to know that many excellent graphic artists on the
Internet can produce one for you at a reasonable price. Type web banner into
any search engine, and you’ll come up with a ton of listings (or use the ani-
mated banner search on eBay as described in Chapter 1). To find a designer
who matches your needs, look at samples (and pricing) on their Web sites.
Figure 3-1 shows the banner ad for my company.
When planning your banner, keep a few points in mind:
✦Go online and study the banner ads. Visit the major search engines and
portals and see how the pros do it.
✦Decide on what you want to say. A banner ad is like a mini-billboard.
There’s no room for a lot of text and graphics; to get attention you have
to keep it simple.

✦Write down key phrases that describe your business. Then write and
rewrite them again, shortening the verbiage. The shorter the message,
the better — as long as it gets your point across.
✦If you must use an image or graphic, settle on one. Having more than
one picture in your banner can be distracting. Remember you only have
a couple of seconds to get the customer’s attention.
Banner Advertising from Microsoft
Banner Advertising, from Microsoft’s Small Business Center, is the new name
for LinkExchange, the original banner ad exchange network on the Internet.
This is one of the largest and most effective networks on the Internet. Small
Business Center rotates your banner throughout its 200,000 sites and gives
you great stats on how often your banner is viewed, your page visits, and
your clickthrough ratio (the number of times people click your banner and
visit your site compared to the number of times your banner is displayed).
Affiliate Programs
An affiliate program is a partnership between your Web site and an online mer-
chant (a company that sells goods or services). It allows you to earn money
when visitors from your site click through to the merchant’s Web site or when
a visitor clicks through to the other party’s site and makes a purchase. 
An affiliate program can represent a value-added service to your Web site’s
visitors or, when carried to an extreme, can dilute your own site’s message
by cluttering your pages with banner ads many find more annoying than
useful. I’m certain you’ve been to Web sites that had more ads than their
own message. Those sites aren’t giving their customers anything to visit.
Carefully consider the companies with whom you want to affiliate. Be sure
their core product ties into the theme of your Web site. Also be sure that
they are not in competition with you. Wouldn’t it be a bummer if your cus-
tomer found an item you’re selling also on the affiliate’s site for less?
Companies can arrange affiliate links between you and other sites. The
Cadillac (Rolls Royce? Mercedes?) of these is LinkShare. 
LinkShare 
LinkShare hosts a password-protected Web site that offers affiliates a choice
of hundreds of top-quality merchant programs. On their site, affiliates can
join new programs, get links to put on their sites, and then see reports about
how their links are performing and how much they’ve earned. When a visitor

Affiliate Programs
546
clicks a link or banner that you’ve inserted on your site and goes to a 
merchant’s site (say, American Express), LinkShare keeps track of all the
transactions that the visitor makes. If that visitor buys something on the
merchant’s site, you get a commission. In some cases, you can be compen-
sated even if your visitor doesn’t buy anything; you’re paid just for having
driven traffic to the merchant’s site. 
LinkShare also provides affiliates with customer service, notifies affiliates
about new programs and new opportunities, and offers resources for affili-
ates to learn about how to get the most out of their programs.
You can also include text links to affiliates in your e-mails and newsletters.
Gussying up your site with some top-name vendors (you must be approved
by each vendor) can give your site some clout. Sign up with LinkShare at
www.linkshare.com. When your site is approved, you can start making
some extra money!
eBay’s affiliate program
I’ve heard that Web site owners have made tens of thousands of dollars a
year with the eBay affiliate program, which is managed through a California
company, Commission-Junction. For every person that goes to eBay from
your Web site (using the specified link or banner), registers with eBay for
the first time, and places a bid on an item, you can get up to $30. Not a bad
return. You also get paid when someone bids on an item from your link.
Tables 3-1 and 3-2 show the current payment schedules. For a registration to
be considered active, the user must place a bid on an item or use Buy It Now
to buy within 30 days of their initial registration. The rates in both tables are
effective as of this writing.

To check the current information and sign up for the program, visit 
affiliates.ebay.com. Some eBay affiliates have issues with the program.
To educate yourself before you sign up, I suggest you read the public affiliate
message board at forums.ebay.com/db1/forum.jsp?forum=118 so you’ll
be familiar with any issues that may affect you or your site. Remember, there’s
no free lunch.
An alternate idea is to set up an eBay Marketplace on your site — or just spe-
cial links to your eBay store (read further in this chapter). Any purchases
made from the Marketplace on your Web site in your eBay store net you a 50%
final value fee credit. Read all about this little-known discount in Book VIII.
Cost-per-Click Advertising with Google
In Chapter 2, I explain how an eBay keyword campaign works. Wouldn’t it be
cool if you could run ads on the Internet at a similarly low price? You can!
One excellent example is Google’s cost-per-click (CPC) offering, AdWords.
Being a regular user of the Google index, I began to notice small ads on the
right side of my searches under a headline called Sponsored Links. I thought
they were expensive links from high-dollar operations until I found out the
truth. If you take a look at the results of a Google search in Figure 3-2, you’ll
see my little ad on the right.
People use Google more than 200 million times a day. Google AdWords allow
you to create these profitable little ads. You choose keywords to let Google
know where to place your ads. Certainly you can come up with some rele-
vant keywords to promote your Web site or eBay store! (If you’re stumped,
try the 30-day free trial of Sellathon mentioned in Book VIII.)

Cost-per-Click Advertising with Google
548
The coolest part of the deal is that you pay for the ad only when someone
clicks it (similar to eBay banners, which are described in Chapter 1). Want to
know more? Go over to www.adwords.com. Once you’re there, you can go
over the details and set up your own campaign.
For your campaign, keep the following in mind:
✦Keywords and keyword phrases: Come up with a list of keywords that
would best describe your merchandise. Google allows you to estimate,
based on current search data, how often your selected keyword will
come up every day. Google will also estimate your daily cost based on the
current amount of clicks on that word. That can be a shocking number.
Don’t worry, not everyone who sees your ad will click it — but if they
did, eeyow!
✦CPC (cost-per-click): You determine how much you’ll pay for each click
on your keywords. You can pay as little as $.05 or as much as $50.00 a
click. The dollar amount you place on your clicks makes the basis for
how often your ad appears.
✦CTR (clickthrough rate): This statistic reflects how many people click
your ad when they see it. If your CTR falls below .5% after 1000 impres-
sions, AdWords may slow or even discontinue your ad views. When one of
your keywords isn’t passing muster, it will be indicated on your reports.
Without showing my keywords, Figure 3-3 shows you a month’s worth of
keyword analysis for my account. You can see clearly that some keywords
are doing their jobs and others aren’t. To keep my account current, I eval-
uate my CTR every month and delete the laggers.

✦Daily budget: You can set the cap in dollars on how much you’ll spend
a day. Otherwise, if you had some really hot keywords, you could spend
thousands on clicks!
Setting up an AdWords account takes a while and some thinking. So wait
until your mind is clear (Saturday morning?) and sit down at the AdWords
site with a cup of coffee.
Google gives you excellent step-by-step instructions after you’re signed in at
www.adwords.com. This is the general process:
1. Decide whether you want to target your ads geographically.
You can pinpoint your market if you’d like, or your can blast the entire
world. Choose from a list of 14 languages, 250 countries, or as far down
as 200 United States regions.
2. Create your ad.
This is not as easy as I thought! You can create only three lines of ad text
with a total of 95 characters. Be as concise as possible. Don’t throw in
useless adjectives. Figure out the perfect 95 characters that will sell your
site to the world. You must also supply your Web site or eBay store URL. 
3. Select your keywords.
Type your keywords and key phrases in the box provided. You can use
Google’s Keyword Suggestion tool to help you out. Because this is your
initial pass and won’t be etched in granite, take some wild stabs and see
what happens.
Figure 3-3:
AdWords
keyword
statistics.

Getting Your URL into a Search Engine
550
4. Choose you maximum CPC (cost-per-click) and then click Calculate
Estimates.
Here’s where the sticker shock gets you. The displayed data lets you
know which keywords you can afford to keep and which ones must be
discarded. If you want to change your CPC amount, do so and click
Recalculate Estimates. The Traffic Estimator calculates how much, on
average, you’ll end up spending in a day.
5. Specify your daily budget.
There will be a prefilled amount that would ensure that your ad stays
on top and gets full exposure every day. No Mr. Google, I do not want to
spend $50 a day on my keywords. Set a cap on your budget and Google
will never exceed it. You may make it as low as you want; there’s no min-
imum spending amount.
6. Enter your e-mail address and agree to the terms.
7. Enter your billing information.
You’re minutes away from your ads going live on the Google index.
Interestingly, your ads may also appear on other places on the Internet
through Google’s Webmaster’s program. Take a look at Figure 3-4. My ad
ended up on my book’s listing page on Amazon because one of my key
phrases is eBay For Dummies (and my targeting is considered relevant).
Getting Your URL into a Search Engine
For people to find your site (and what you’re selling), they must be able to
locate you. A popular way people do this is by searching with a search engine,
so you should submit your site to search engines. Go to the search engines
that interest you and look for a link or a help area that will enable you to
submit your site. Be sure to follow any specific instructions on the site; some
may limit the amount of keywords and the characters in your description.

Getting Your URL into a Search Engine
551
To submit your URL to search engines, you need to do a little work (noth-
ing’s easy, is it?). Write down 25 to 50 words or phrases that describe your
Web site; these are your keywords. Now, using as many of the words you
came up with, write a description of your site. With the remaining words,
create a list of keywords, separating each word or short phrase with a
comma. You can use these keywords to add meta tags to the header in your
HTML document for your home page. Meta tags are identifiers used by search
engine spiders, robots that troll the Internet looking for new sites to classify
on search engines. Meta tags are used like this:
<META NAME = “insert your keywords here separated by commas”
CONTENT = “short description of your site”>
If you have a problem coming up with keywords, check out Yahoo! GeoCities
handy meta tag generator, which you can use for free:

Have Submit It! do the work
Submit It!, part of Microsoft’s Small Business Center, handles your site sub-
missions to hundreds of online search engines automatically, saving you the
trouble of going from site to site. For $49 a year, the service will submit and
resubmit as many as ten URLs as often as you’d like. They even send you a reg-
ular report of their progress. Your site will also be listed in the Microsoft Small
Business Directory as part of your subscription. This is money well spent.
Double-check to be sure that your Web-hosting company doesn’t offer a simi-
lar service at a discount.
Get listed on Yahoo! 
Yahoo! is one of the more difficult sites to list with, although you can get a
free listing if you fill out all the forms correctly and wait six to eight weeks.
Instructions for the free listing are at the following:
http://submit.search.yahoo.com/free/request
If you pay Yahoo! Express $299, you’ll be listed immediately (funny how that
works). Go to the following for more details:

Yahoo! guarantees that requests will be reviewed in just seven business days.

Catch attention on Google
Have you ever Googled your eBay store? I did, by searching for the name
of my eBay store and including the word eBay in the search parameters.
Figure 3-5 shows you the results. 
You too should Google your Web site and eBay store to see whether it’s
listed. If it isn’t, you’re missing out on a huge opportunity for free promotion.
Google runs spiders (just picture the way a spider runs — swiftly and all
over the place) that scour the Internet on a monthly basis looking for data
to become part of the Google index.
Thousands of sites (and you do know that since your eBay store has a
unique URL, it’s considered to be a Web site) are added to the Google index
every time their spiders crawl the Web. 
If our eBay store isn’t listed, go to www.google.com/addurl.html, as pic-
tured in Figure 3-6. When you get to this page, type your eBay store URL. To
find your store’s URL, click the red store tag next to your eBay user ID to go
to your store, and then copy and paste the URL (in the address line of your
browser) into the URL line on the form. When I went to my eBay store, I got
this URL:
Figure 3-5:
Wow! My

In the second line, add a comment if you want, describing your store mer-
chandise. Then click Submit. There are no guarantees here, but odds are
you’ll find your little shop on Google within a few weeks.
What’s the zeitgeist?
It’s all about the zeitgeist. And what the heck,
you may wonder, is a zeitgeist? Zeitgeist comes
from the German (originally geist der zeit) words
zeit meaning time and geist meaning spirit. It’s
the all-embracing intellectual atmosphere of a
distinct time period. In today’s terms? It’s the
buzz.
Similar to the Yahoo! Buzz, the Google zeitgeist
keeps current and historic data on the site. The
zeitgeist is based on the total number of queries
on a particular subject in a certain period of time.
It’s updated on a weekly, monthly, and, when
called for, daily basis, and can be found at
www.google.com/press/zeitgeist.
html. 
From that page, you can also see the zeitgeist
(what’s hot and what’s not) in other countries
(invaluable information if you’re selling on eBay
internationally) including the United Kingdom,
Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, the
Netherlands, Australia, and Japan. This page
also links to historical zeitgeist data.
The zeitgeist page is where you can get the
nuggets of thought for your marketing and sell-
ing plans. The zeitgeist also has information for
previous periods. If you take a look at the figure,
you’ll find some obvious data (hindsight is
20/20). If you were selling items based on any
of the popular queries or brands in 2003, it’s fair
to say you did very well. Check out the zeitgeist.
It could be your crystal ball into stocking your
store.

Using eBay Marketplace
If you don’t want to set up a separate Web site for your items for sale, eBay
has a super alternative idea. Why not install an eBay Marketplace on your
Web site? Even if your Web site isn’t commercial and just has pictures of the
baby or your dog, people will stop by — why not show off your eBay listings!
(Just be careful when selling the ugly lamp that Aunt Lizzie gave you for
Christmas!) Figure 3-7 shows a portion of my eBay Marketplace on one of my
Web sites.
eBay updates your eBay Marketplace every 20 minutes and shows all your
listings, including gallery pictures. Best of all — the service is free!
eBay generates a sniplet of HTML for you to insert on your Web page. That’s
all there is to it! Your eBay listings will then automatically appear on your
Web page, with no effort from you. eBay’s API does all the work.
To get your own Marketplace, go to 
pages.eBay.com/api/merchantkit.html
You are going into the deepest recesses of eBay and accessing their API
(application program interface). The tools the big guys use for their eBay
sales are now available to you!

gory, or items from your personal store categories.
✦Choose the number of items ending first to show: You may select from

W
hen you think of PayPal, you might think of it as just a payment serv-
ice on eBay, but it’s much, much more. Did you know that PayPal has
shops? Yes! It’s another place to sell your wares online. PayPal also has some
great tools for your Web site. In this chapter, I give you the information you
need to be fully PayPal-enabled!
Setting Up Shop at PayPal
Before PayPal joined eBay, they were pulling out every trick in the book to
get members. The company was founded with a desire to give their cus-
tomers plenty of extras for their loyalty, and they have tons of tools to
enhance the seller’s online selling experience. The tools and the prices
charged by PayPal are unmatched by any other online payment service. 
Joining PayPal shops
The best part of joining PayPal shops is that there’s no cost to you. A PayPal
shop is not a separate online store but a link from the PayPal mall (so to
speak) to a unique group of shops. More than 40 million PayPal members
may browse this area at any time, so why not avail yourself of this free mar-
keting opportunity? 
The shop can link to your eBay store, or you can link to your PayPal-enabled
business Web site. Think of it as a way to double your store’s visibility on the
Web without spending more in fees. Your store will be listed in the PayPal
Shops directory, as shown in Figure 4-1.
Notice that the PayPal hub has categories (on the left side of the page) and a
shop search. The categories whittle down into subcategories, just like eBay.
(But you won’t find any sub-subcategories.)

Setting Up Shop at PayPal
558
I used the search box to find some pretty things and came up with the
search results shown in Figure 4-2. Notice the number next to each store
name. No, it’s not the seller’s feedback rating; it’s the PayPal seller reputa-
tion number.

PayPal shopping invitations
As a PayPal shop owner, you have an additional benefit. When a customer
sends you payment from an area other than your Web site (hmm, like your
sales on eBay?), PayPal displays an invitation to shop at your store! A sample
of that invitation is shown in Figure 4-3.
That’s a cool deal, don’t you think? Who would have figured you’d get help
for your outside Web site from an eBay company? But, as with any cool deal,
you must meet a few requirements before you can set up your shop at PayPal:
✦Verified premier or business account: You must maintain one of the
higher-level PayPal accounts.
✦Registered credit card: You must maintain a current credit card regis-
tered to your PayPal account.
✦Confirmed checking account: You must have at least one confirmed
checking account tied into your PayPal account.
✦Money market fund: You are required to sign up for the PayPal money
market fund. This means you must supply PayPal with your Social
Security number or the Federal ID number for your business.
PayPal does not send out Federal 1099 forms on your PayPal sales. That
income is coming from your buyers, and because you’re not paid by PayPal,
they won’t issue a 1099 for your PayPal sales.
PayPal offers you FDIC pass-through insurance. PayPal deposits your money
as part of pooled accounts in several banks: Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Comerica
Bank – California, USA, and Bank of America, N.A. In the very unlikely event
that any of these major banks should fail, your money would be covered under
the FDIC pass-through deposit insurance, along with any other deposits you
Figure 4-3:
An invitation

Shops.

Setting Up Shop at PayPal
560
have at that bank, up to $100,000. FDIC pass-through deposit insurance pro-
tects you only against the failure of the bank at which PayPal places your
funds and does not protect you against PayPal’s very unlikely insolvency.
After you’re committed to the idea that you’d like a PayPal shop (and assum-
ing that you’re qualified), the application process is easy. Just follow these
steps:
1. Give your PayPal shop a name.
The name doesn’t have to match your Web site. Give your shop a smart
marketing name, something that will catch a person’s eye while brows-
ing the stores.
2. Give PayPal the URL that you want to link your PayPal shop to.
This can be your eBay store or your own e-commerce, PayPal-enabled
Web site.
3. Type a short description of your Web site.
Be as descriptive as possible and make it interesting!
4. Select the two categories from the PayPal Shops category list that best
describe your store.
5. List up to ten keywords to describe your store to search engines.
Be smart! Find out which are your best keywords with the Google key-
word tool at 
https://adwords.google.com/select/main?cmd=
KeywordSandbox
Featured Shop consideration
After you set up your PayPal shop, you can apply to be selected as a fea-
tured shop — with your logo — on the PayPal logoff page (the page that
appears when you sign off PayPal).
To apply, you must include another brief Web site description, along with all
the reasons you’d make a great selection as the featured shop. 
PayPal then selects their shops from the applications based on the quality
of the site and how well and prominently PayPal is integrated into it. Not a
bad deal!
Just think, if only a few of the 40 million PayPal members click onto your
Web site when exiting their transactions, you could be rolling in orders!

Site statistics
Every month, PayPal sends statistics on hits to PayPal shopkeepers. Don’t
worry; these statistics aren’t a bunch of useless information — they’re all
about your Web site hits! Take a look at a sample in Figure 4-4. Remember
that this report only counts hits as placed through links from the PayPal
Shops area, not any independent hits you get from the Internet.
Cashing In on the PayPal Referral Program
And you thought the days of getting money for referring people to PayPal
were over? Hah! PayPal has set its sights a little higher. Now they want busi-
ness account referrals rather than personal users.
You can send invitations to use PayPal in your e-mails using a custom link, or
you can place a banner on your Web site. You receive $10 if a merchant you
refer uses any of PayPal’s Web site tools. You can earn more after your refer-
ral receives a total of $1000 in Send Money payments.
It’s kind of like multilevel marketing. After the referral posts the initial $1000
in sales, you receive a percentage of your referral’s revenue, up to a maxi-
mum of $100, for the first six months of their PayPal account. The residual
payout equals .5% of the merchant’s net sales.
No spamming!!!
To get in on this good deal, go to the little navigation bar at the bottom of
the page and click Referrals. After you arrive at the target page, you’re pre-
sented with two links, as shown in Figure 4-5. One is a referral link for e-mail,
and the other is a big honking PayPal banner that you can put on your Web
site. (HTML custom coding is generated for you — just copy and paste it
onto your Web page.)

If you think that PayPal is only for your eBay business, think again! Before
eBay purchased PayPal, approximately 15% of PayPal’s revenues came from
online gaming. When eBay took over in late 2002, PayPal no longer received
revenue from this arena. And there’s good news for us: Today they offer the
same tools to process PayPal payments on your own personal or business
Web sites.
Aside from your eBay store, you can sell directly from your Web site or your
AOL HomeTown page. In time, as your eBay business grows into your own
Web site, you’ll find that using PayPal as your payment provider is a great
deal. You pay the same transaction fees — to PayPal only — for processing
your credit card sales.
Build business by including your Web site URL in your e-mail signature, let-
ting the world know you’re open for business 24/7. Your My eBay page can
also include links to your e-commerce-enabled Web site — it’s fully in line
with the eBay rules!
In this section, you discover how to make your own Web site an extra rev-
enue builder. I’m going to use my Web site as the example. It’s a basic Web
site, but people can (and do) shop there from time to time. Remember, any
sale you make from your own Web site involves no eBay fees and means
extra income for you.

Making the PayPal payment option 
available on your site
After you get a few items in your garage or business location that you stock
in quantity, you’ve got the makings of your own Web store. Don’t let the
thought of this spook you. You can do this!
The first step is to create a Web site. When you have the site up and running,
Buy Now buttons are the most basic way to enable sales through PayPal from
your site. These buttons are easy to insert — you don’t have to be a com-
puter whiz to create the links because PayPal makes this almost automatic.
There’s no fee to use this service (other than the processing fee when some-
one buys an item). All you need is a verified PayPal premier or business
account.
When someone buys something from your Web site, the procedure is the
same as when someone pays for an eBay item. You receive an e-mail from
PayPal telling you that a Web payment (versus an eBay payment) has been
received. The e-mail subject includes the item number you’ve assigned in
your code (it can also be an item name, as shown in Figure 4-6).
Creating a button on the PayPal Web site
If you want to save a bunch of time, try to use the sample coding in the
“Coding for do-it-yourselfers” section. Just customize the HTML coding
(with your Web site details) and put it into your Web page. If it doesn’t work
or you’re too nervous to do real coding, follow the next set of instructions
for placing the PayPal button on your site.

To create a payment button on your Web site, first log on to the PayPal Web
site. From there, follow these steps:
1. Click the Merchant Tools tab, at the top of the page, as shown in
Figure 4-7.
2. Scroll down to the Web Site Payments area.
3. Click the Create Buy Now Buttons link.
The Selling Single Items page, shown in Figure 4-8, appears.
4. Enter your item information, including the item name, ID, price, cur-
rency, and default buyer’s country.
Here’s a list of all the items you’re asked to enter on the Selling Single
Items page. Many of these are optional:
• Item name: Input your item (or service) name.
• ID number: Give your item an ID number or name.
I recommend that you use a number and abbreviated name, which
appear in the subject line of the e-mail that PayPal sends when some-
one makes a purchase. 
• Item price: Enter the item price here. (There’s a $2000 limit for new
buyers.)
• Currency: Decide what currency you’re willing to accept for your
purchases. (If you’re in the U.S., go for the dollars.)
Figure 4-7:

• International buyers: If you accept international orders, specify here
whether you want your buyer’s payment page to default to a specific
country. If you don’t specify, buyers can choose for themselves. But I
selected the United States to make it faster for most purchasers.
• Select a button: Choose a Buy Now button to insert on your page. If
you don’t like the one pictured, click the Choose a different button
link to see more options, as shown in Figure 4-9.
Refer to this list when you examine the full sample code shown later in
this chapter. It will help explain what goes into each input type field.

I like using the buttons that include the name PayPal because they help
reassure new shoppers that their transactions with you will be secure.
You also have the opportunity to design your own button, but hey, why
make extra work for yourself right now? Just set up a standard button
and get fancy later.
5. After you’ve made settings on the Selling Single Items page and
chosen a button to insert, click Continue.
6. On the next page, do the following:
• Options: Click the Add More Options box to enter shipping and sales
tax information for your item. 
• Shipping and handling fee: On the form, select a flat shipping and
handling charge or one based on a percentage of the item’s price. 
Unfortunately, PayPal doesn’t supply a cool shipping calculator.
You can put a postal shipping chart on your item page and let your
buyers insert the proper shipping amount, or you can enter a ship-
ping amount on this page that lands somewhere in the middle of the
highest (farthest away) and lowest (closest) zone to your shipping
location. You’ll lose a little on some but make it up on others.
• Sales tax: Select your state and enter the appropriate sales tax to be
applied to your in-state purchases. If you already have a sales tax
provision in your PayPal profile, it will be listed here automatically.
PayPal will apply the sales tax for sales shipped within your state.
• Item options: If your item has options (if, for example, it comes in 
different sizes or colors), you can create a custom drop-down list
for your payment page so the customer can choose; just type the
offered options in this box.
• Insert your logo: To add a logo to your payment page, type the URL
where the file is stored. PayPal will place the logo on your payment
page. The logo you use must be sized at 150 x 50 pixels, or PayPal
won’t accept it.
• Payment landing page: If you want your customers to land on a spe-
cific page after they’ve made a payment — setting up a thank-you
page on your Web site is a nice idea, for example — enter that URL
here. Figure 4-10 shows a portion of my Web site’s basic thank-you
page. The page also has links to take the buyer back to my Web site.
Figure 4-10:

567
• Cancel transaction page: If you want to include a page where people
are taken if they cancel the transaction before completing it, you can
insert that address here. If you don’t specify a page, they will land at
a PayPal Web page.
• Quantity: If you’d like your customers to be able to purchase more
than one of your item at a time, you may indicate that here. The
buyers will then be able to fill in a number in a quantity field.
• Shipping address: Click Yes if you’d like the customer’s shipping
address. I guess it would be kind of useless not to ask for a shipping
address when you’re expected to ship the item somewhere, huh? It
does kind of take the guesswork out of things to include this field!
• Optional instructions: If you’d like your buyers to be able to write
you a note, click Yes in this field.
7. Click Preview.
You see a sample of the page your customer will see after making a Web
payment to you. 
8. If the page is okay, click the Return button. 
9. Click the Create Button Now button.
That’s all there is to creating your first Buy Now button and the payment
page that appears when it’s clicked. When you get the hang of it, I’m sure
you’d rather code your own. It’s really easy (even I can do it) and consider-
ably faster. Read on.
Coding for do-it-yourselfers
Yes, there’s an easy way and a formal way to do everything. Because I am
unreasonably busy, I did my Web site PayPal buttons the easy way — 
without a bunch of options.
The items I sell on my Web site can’t be combined in one box. Each has to
be shipped in an individual box, and postage must be charged for each item.
I therefore don’t use the shopping cart method. 
Figure 4-11 shows a payment button on one of the pages on my site. When
the mouse “rolls over” the payment button, a PayPal message appears. 
Figure 4-11:
My PayPal

When you click the payment button, you land on my Cool eBay Tools PayPal
payment page (shown in Figure 4-12, complete with custom logo). The PayPal
payment page is a secure page (as indicated by the lock icon) directly from
PayPal. The URL for the page begins with https; the s at the end indicates
that the site is secure.
Here’s the code I used to create that payment button and link to the result-

W
hen you consider placing advertising for your business, budget is
always an issue. This is the case whether you’re in a brick-and-
mortar store, on your own Web site, or selling on eBay. When I was in the
advertising business, one of the biggest challenges we had was convincing
a startup to spend money on advertising. It’s simple arithmetic: You spend
money on advertising and it attracts more people to your store.
The ace-in-the-hole for any retailer is co-op advertising, which puts advertis-
ing dollars contributed by a manufacturer (or other interested party) into
the company’s advertising campaign. The manufacturer benefits by getting
its name out to potential buyers, and the retailer attracts more buyers
(and ideally increases sales revenue) by more vigorously advertising the
manufacturer’s product.
Many manufacturers have co-op advertising programs available based on
the dollar amount that the retailer purchases from them. Even if you buy
your merchandise for eBay sales from a wholesaler instead of the manufac-
turer, you may still be able to share some of the co-op funds available to
your wholesaler. Just ask — the worst you’ll hear is “No,” and maybe your
wholesaler will say “Absolutely!”
After you have the co-op advertising dollars, where do you spend them?
Almost any traditional media will do, but in the case of eBay, print media
is the target. You can get co-op advertising dollars if you advertise in your
local newspapers, magazines, catalogs, specialty collectors’ publications, or
any publication with a circulation figure of 10,000 or more. As a coin collec-
tor, I’ve noticed several eBay co-op ads in my monthly coin magazine, and
I’ve seen these ads in other publications too. Sound like a good deal? In this
chapter, I give you some hints on finding the right places for advertising
your business.

Cashing In on the Co-Op Program

Cashing In on the Co-Op Program
What could be better than advertising your business and having someone
else help pay for it? To get your little mitts on some of eBay’s co-op cash
stash, you must qualify by being one of the following:
✦An eBay PowerSeller who operates an eBay store: This is almost a
given. If you’re a PowerSeller, you no doubt already have an eBay store.
✦An eBay PowerSeller who is a registered Trading Assistant: Again, if
you’re a PowerSeller, I don’t doubt that you’ve sold items for others in
the past. If you’re not a registered Trading Assistant, check Book IV,
Chapter 3, for more info.
I think you’ve noticed the constant in this list. You have to be a PowerSeller
to qualify for co-op dollars. If you think about it, this requirement makes
sense. eBay would logically choose to put this kind of investment into
those sellers with experience selling on the site and with a high GMS
(Gross Merchandise Sales). For qualifications and direction on becoming
a PowerSeller, see Book VIII, Chapter 5.
How much will eBay pay?
eBay will pay up to 25% of your advertising bill as long as your ad has been
approved before printing. You can get an extra discount through some publi-
cations, which smartly court eBay PowerSeller advertising. These publications
are members of eBay’s Preferred Publisher Program. Table 5-1 gives you a
current list.

These discounts are in addition to your 25% eBay reimbursement. In some
cases you save 50%. To check to see whether more publications have joined
eBay’s Preferred Publisher (yet another) program, visit
www.ebaycoopadvertising.com/preferredpublisher.aspx
When approaching any publication for advertising, don’t forget to ask for a
discount. Discounts are available to many people for many reasons, and per-
haps you can tailor your ad (a certain size or theme) to get the deal. Maybe
you’ll get a discount, maybe you won’t. Just be sure to ask.
eBay gives sellers a budget, and that budget is based on your PowerSeller
level, which is based on the monthly average of your GMVS. The budget
renews ever calendar quarter, and you can only spend to the limit assigned to
your level within one quarter. Amounts that are not used cannot be carried
over to the next quarter. Table 5-2 shows you the reimbursement budgets.

How do you get your money?
Claims for reimbursement may be submitted to eBay at any time during
the time your ad runs, but must be received no later than 60 days after the
initial insertion date. As long as your claim is qualified — you have to get
your claim approved before you run the ad — you’ll be paid through PayPal
within 45 days of eBay’s receipt of your claim.
By now I bet you’re convinced that this is a good deal. To get your piece of
the pie, here’s the condensed version of the sign-up procedure:
1. Go to the Co-op Advertising page and click the key to Register.
The URL for the page is www.ebaycoopadvertising.com.
2. After you’re registered, click the Ad Creation Wizard link to set up
the ad template.

Choosing Where to Run Your Ad
574
3. Upload your ad for pre-approval.
When the ad is approved, you’ll receive an authorization number in an
e-mail.
4. Run your ad.
5. When the ad appears, go to the following and print the reimburse-
ment form:
http://www.ebaycoopadvertising.com/Claims/
SubmitReimbursement
6. Put the following documentation into one envelope:
• Your completed reimbursement form
• A full tearsheet from the publication running your ad (the entire
page, not just a cutout of your ad)
• A copy of the invoice from the publisher
• The publication’s rate card stating it has a confirmed circulation of
10,000 or more
7. Mail the whole shebang to the address at the bottom of the reimburse-
ment form.
Choosing Where to Run Your Ad
Here’s another reason why I say that you should know what you sell. If
you’re selling collectible coins, you know which trade (or special interest)
publications you like to read. Why don’t you give those a shot first?
If you’re not really sure, or perhaps you’d like to see what other publications
are available, go over to Google and search the words magazine, publication,
news along with the keyword that describes the items you sell. Go to the
publication’s Web site and check out their advertising department.
You should plan your ad campaign several months before you’d like the ads
to appear. Many publications have a long lead-time between booking and
final publishing.
Following are a few more tips about advertising your business that you can
take to heart:
✦Preview the publication: If you’ve never seen the publication before,
e-mail (or call the toll-free number) and ask for a sample along with the
rate card. They’ll be more than willing to send you a back issue!

Book VI
Chapter 5

After you get a copy of the magazine, newspaper, or whatever, take a
hard look at it and answer these questions: Would people who read this
publication be likely to shop at your eBay store? Do you like the maga-
zine? Does it fit your perception of your customers’ lifestyle? Do the
advertisers seem legitimate?
✦Check out the ad rates: With publications, cheap doesn’t always mean
best. Figure out what your cost per thousand readers will be and keep
that in mind. When the ad runs, use your eBay statistics (more about
getting stats from eBay in Book VIII) to see how much of an increase
you get in visitors.
✦Consider running your ad more than once: A one-time ad rarely pulls
enough to pay for itself. A consistent advertising campaign of repeated
ads (even every other issue) will get the attention of the publication’s
readership and build their confidence in you and increase visits to your
store. A consistent campaign works much better than scattered ads here
and there with no direction.
✦Start out small with a single publication: That will make it easier for
you to track the success of your campaign.
eBay maintains a list of qualified newspapers and magazines. It’s a long and
ever-changing list, so go to the following for the most up-to-date information:
www.ebaycoopadvertising.com/QualifiedPublisher.aspx
Creating Your Ad
Because these ads have to be approved by eBay, it might behoove you to
follow their rules regarding which logos you can use, as well as their size
and color. You might want to use eBay’s Ad Creation Wizard. The wizard has
templates in different sizes, as well as themed templates for eBay stores or
Trading Assistants.
Figure 5-1 shows an ad I’m starting to design with the Ad Creation Wizard.
You can select from different typefaces, type sizes, and colors for each area
of your ad.
The only problem I have with the wizard is that it’s not flexible. For example,
it doesn’t allow you to vary your type size within an area, and you can’t make
bulleted lists or italics. Still, the wizard works quickly, and within a few min-
utes, I put together the ad in Figure 5-2.
If you have the talent, I think you should take some extra time and download
the templates and logos from the Download Assets area and create an ad that
suits your style.

Creating Your Ad
576
When designing your own ad, the eBay logo portion must occupy at least
one-eighth of the overall ad size to be eligible for reimbursement.
To be sure that your ad will qualify for reimbursement under the co-op
advertising plan, be sure to upload an electronic copy of it through the
My Ads area. After you upload it, you simply click the Submit button to
submit the ad for approval. Along with your ad approval, you receive your
pre-approval authorization number. The length of time for which this number
is active depends on the ad itself:
✦If you design your ad with eBay’s Ad Creation Wizard, you can continue
to use the same pre-approval authorization number until eBay redesigns
the templates. When a template redesign happens, eBay lets you know
by e-mail.
✦If you design the ad yourself, the number expires within 90 days. After
that, you need to resubmit the ad and get a new pre-approval authoriza-
tion number.
All your approved ads will be held (with details of approval) on the www.
ebaycoopadvertising.com site.

Department

 Organizing your stock
 Keeping inventory
 Packing up
 Buying stamps without a trip to the post office
T
he more items you sell, the more confusing things can get. As you build
your eBay business, the little side table you use for storing eBay merchan-
dise isn’t going to work. You must think industrial. Even part-time sellers
can benefit by adding a few professional touches to their business areas.
In this chapter, I emphasize the importance of setting up and organizing your
back office. I cover everything from stacking your stock to keeping inventory
to indispensable packing materials and saving time by buying postage online.
Organization will be your byword. Dive right in. The sooner you read this
chapter, the sooner you can build your eBay back office and get down to
business.
The Warehouse: Organizing Your Space
Whether you plan to sell large items or small items, you need space for storing
them. As you make savvy purchases, maintaining an item’s mint condition will
be one of your greatest challenges. In this section, I cover the details of what
you’ll need to safeguard your precious stock.
Shelving your profits
Before you stock the shelves, it helps to have some! You also need a place to
put the shelves: your garage, a spare room, or somewhere else. For the home-
based business, you have a choice between two basic kinds of shelves:
✦Plastic: If you’re just starting out, you can always go to the local closet
and linen supply store to buy inexpensive plastic shelves. They’re light
and cheap but they’ll buckle in time.

The Warehouse: Organizing Your Space
582
✦Steel: If you want to do it right the first time, buy steel shelving. The most
versatile steel shelving is the wire kind (versus solid steel shelves), which
is light and allows air to circulate around your items. Steel wire shelving
assembles easily; I put mine together without help. You can combine
steel wire shelving units to create a full wall of shelves. Each shelf safely
holds as much as 600 pounds of merchandise.
To save you time, dear reader, I researched the subject and found some read-
ily available, reasonably priced shelves. Just go to Sam’s Club or Costco and
look for Seville Classics four-shelf commercial shelving, sold in 36- and 48-inch-
wide units. These shelves are available also on the Costco Web site, but you
have to pay for shipping.
You can easily convert a garage or a spare room to a professional and func-
tional stock room. Figure 1-1 shows a portion of my stock area. 
Box ’em or bag ’em?
Packing your items for storage can be a challenge. For smaller items, pick 
up some plastic bags in sandwich, quart, and gallon sizes. When items are
stored in plastic, they can’t pick up any smells or become musty before you
sell them. The plastic also protects the items from rubbing against each
other and causing possible damage. If you package them one item to a bag,
you can then just lift one off the shelf and put it directly into a shipping box
when the listing is over.
Your bags of items will have to go into boxes for storage on the shelves. Clear
plastic storage boxes, the kind you often find at superstores, are great for
bulky items. They’re usually 26 inches, so before you buy these big plastic con-
tainers, make sure that they’ll fit on your shelving comfortably and that you’ll
have easy access to your items. Using cardboard office-type file storage boxes
from an office supply store is another option. These cardboard boxes are 
10 x 12 x 16 inches, which is a nice size for storing medium-size products. At
around $1 each, they’re the most economical choice. The downside is that you
can’t see through cardboard boxes, so if your label falls off, you have to take
the box off the shelf and open it to check its contents. Smaller see-through
plastic boxes with various compartments, such as the type home improve-
ment stores carry for storing tools, work great for storing very small items.
When using these large plastic bins, it’s always a good idea to tape a pad of
Post-it notes on the end of the box so you can quickly identify the contents.
You can use regular sticky-labels, but changing them will leave large amounts
of paper residue over time, and your storage will look sloppy and icky.
Speaking of bins, Figure 1-2 shows you the bins in the small parts area of the
warehouse of eBay seller banderson-at-fuse. His setup isn’t exactly what the
home seller will need, but it sometimes helps to see how the big guys do it.

Keeping Track of What You Have
584
Keeping Track of What You Have
Savvy eBay sellers have different methods of handling inventory. They use
everything from spiral-bound notebooks to sophisticated software programs.
Although computerized inventory tracking can simplify this task, starting
with a plain ol’ handwritten ledger is fine, too. Choose whichever works best
for you, but keep in mind that as your eBay business grows, a software pro-
gram that tracks inventory for you may become necessary.
Most of these systems wouldn’t work for a company with a warehouse full of
stock but will work nicely in an eBay sales environment. Many sellers tape
sheets of paper to their boxes to identify them by number, and use that as a
reference to a simple Excel spreadsheet for selling purposes. Excel spread-
sheets are perfect for keeping track of your auctions as well, but if you’re
using a management service or software, you don’t need both for physical
inventory.
When you’re running a full-time business, however, you have to keep Uncle
Sam happy with a dollars and cents accounting of your inventory, so keep
your inventory records in a standardized program such as QuickBooks 
(discussed in Book IX). I describe a variety of auction management software
and Web sites, many of which include physical inventory tracking features.
You may also want to use Excel spreadsheets for your downloaded PayPal
statements, to hold information waiting to transfer to your bookkeeping pro-
gram. I post my sales each time I make a PayPal withdrawal (a couple of
times a week). I keep the PayPal downloads only for archival purposes.
In my eBay business, I keep my inventory record in QuickBooks. Each time I
purchase merchandise for my business, I post it in the program. When I post
my sales each week, QuickBooks automatically deducts the sold items from
my inventory. I then do a physical inventory as product stock runs low.
Planning: The key to good organization
When I had to put my eBay merchandise in
order, I was busy with my regular business, so
I hired a friend to organize my eBay area. This
decision turned out to be one massive mistake.
My friend organized everything and put all my
items in boxes — but didn’t label the boxes to
indicate what was stored in each. To this day I
still haven’t recovered and don’t know where a
bunch of my stuff is!
A bit of advice: Think things out and plan where
you’ll put everything. Organize your items 
by theme, type, or size. If you organize before
planning, you might end up with organized 
disorganization.

The Shipping Department: Packin’ It Up
In this section, I review some of the things you must have for a complete,
smooth-running shipping department, such as cleaning supplies and packing
materials. The handling fee portion of your shipping charges pays for these
kinds of items. Don’t run low on them and pay attention to how you store
them. They must be kept in a clean environment.
Pre-packaging clean up
Be sure the items you send out are in tip-top shape. Here are a few everyday
chemicals that can gild the lily:
✦WD-40: The decades-old lubricant works very well at getting price stickers
off plastic and glass without damaging the product. The plastic on a toy
box may begin to look nasty, even when stored in a clean environment.
A quick wipe with a paper towel and a dash of WD-40 will make it shine
like new. It also works well for untangling jewelry chains and shining up
metallic objects.

✦Goo Gone: Goo Gone works miracles in cleaning up gooey sticker
residue from nonporous items.
✦un-du: This amazing liquid easily removes stickers off cardboard, 
plastic, fabrics, and more without causing damage. It comes packaged
with a patented miniscraper top that you can use in any of your sticker
cleaning projects. If you can’t find un-du, check out my Web site (www.
coolebaytools.com) for places to purchase it.
Packing materials
The most important area where sellers drop the time-and-money ball is in
shipping. I buy hundreds of items from eBay and have seen it all when it
comes to packing, padding, and shipping. I’ve seen money thrown out the
window by e-tailers that have used incorrect packing materials, which are
expensive for the seller and often increase the shipping cost of the package
for the buyer due to the final weight.
The packing materials that you use for your shipments can either make or
break your bottom line in the shipping income/expense column of your busi-
ness reports.
Many sellers remark, “The buyer pays shipping, so what do I care what it
costs? I pass on all those expenses to my buyers.” Well, yes and no. Prudent
packing can be a boon to your business because having lower shipping costs
can often make the difference between a sale and no sale. This is especially
true when several people have the same item up for sale, with a minuscule
difference in the item’s selling price. Reasonable shipping charges can make
the difference.
Removing musty odors from apparel items
Clothing can often pick up odors that you just
don’t notice. I recently bought a designer dress
on eBay from a seller who had the typical dis-
claimer in her description: “No stains, holes,
repairs, or odors. Comes from a smoke-free,
pet-free home.” 
Unfortunately, the minute I opened the box I
could smell the musty odor of an item that had
been stored for a long time.
To prevent that icky, storage odor, keep a pack-
age of Dryel Fabric Care System around. This is
a safe, do-it-yourself dry cleaning product. Just
toss your better eBay clothing items in the
patented Dryel bag with the special sheet and
toss it in the dryer as per the instructions on 
the box. Your garment will come out smelling
clean — and wrinkle free. For more informa-
tion, visit their Web site at www.Dryel.com.

Pay attention to packing. It’s only expensive if you don’t know what you’re
doing. You can ship your items in quality packing, keep buyers happy, and
still make a dollar or so on each item for your handling fees.
Buying your shipping materials on eBay is trés economical. eBay shipping
supply e-tailers make their living selling online. Their overhead is much lower
than any retail outlet. Even after paying shipping to get the bubble wrap to
your door, you save money and time. Most of these sellers ship the same day
they get your order.
Only use as much packing material as necessary to get the item where it’s
going intact. This saves time, money, and space.
Using void fill
Nope! Void fill is not a new drug to prevent hunger pangs when dieting. Void
fill is the industry term for the stuff you use to fill up space in shipping boxes
to keep items from rolling in transit. (It’s really the modern term for the old-
fashioned word, dunnage.)
There are many forms of void fill, and the best kind depends on the item
you’re shipping. Here are the most popular types, and a description of their
plusses and minuses.
So that you can always be sure that your items will arrive at their destina-
tions in one piece, you’ll want to keep the following on hand at all times:
✦Air packing pillows: I found out about these nifty little pillows when I
received books from a major online bookseller. Buying air packing pillows
from sellers on eBay is economical, mainly because the manufacturing
and shipping costs are low. What these folks are essentially shipping you
is 99% air (something the post office hasn’t yet figured out how to charge
for). You can find air pillows in the Business and Industrial category.
Air packing pillows are perfect for filling in the area around smaller boxed
items that you want to double box. They are also handy if you have
breakables that you’ve prewrapped in bubble wrap; just use the pillows
to fill out the box. They’re crushproof and can support plus or minus
150 pounds without a blowout.
✦Bubble wrap: Made up of air-filled cushions of polyethylene, bubble wrap
is supplied in rolls of different widths and lengths (see Figure 1-4). It
shines for those who wrap delicate, breakable items. When wrapping an
item with bubble wrap, wrap it one way and then the other, and then affix
some packing tape to make your item an impenetrable ball. Depending on
your product, you may have to carry two sizes of bubble wrap to properly
protect the goods. Bubble wrap is reasonably priced (check out the many
vendors on eBay) and adds next to no weight to your packages.

The Shipping Department: Packin’ It Up
588
When you purchase bubble wrap, be sure you buy the perforated, or
tear-off, kind. Cutting a giant roll of bubble wrap with a box cutter can be
a dangerous proposition.
✦Plain old white newsprint: In the right shipping situation, plain white
newsprint is fantastic. eBay sellers dealing in glass, china, and breakable
knick-knacks often use white newsprint to wrap each piece before plac-
ing it in a box full of packing peanuts.
White newsprint is cheap and easy to store. The bad news? It’s heavy
and sellers often use too many sheets to wrap the items they pack. If you
feel you must use newsprint, I suggest you buy it by the roll and use a
table-mounted roll cutter to cut the exact size you need. (This is the
kind of thing you may have seen in old-style butcher shops and delis.)
This setup helps you to avoid using too much paper.
✦Styrofoam packing peanuts: Every serious eBay seller has to have a
stock of packing peanuts. When properly placed in a box, peanuts fill
every nook and cranny and cushion your shipment to make it virtually
indestructible. They’re handy for padding Tyvek envelopes and filling
boxes so that items don’t shift around. A bonus: They’re cheap and if
you recycle them, they don’t hurt the environment.
When packing with peanuts, the key is to not go short in the land of
plenty. Use enough peanuts to fill the box completely; leaving any air-
space defeats the point of using the peanuts in the first place.
More packing supplies
Your shipping department needs just a few more items. Don’t forget to
include the following at the outset of your packing career:

✦Plastic bags: Buy plastic bags in bulk to save money. Make sure you buy
various sizes and use them for both shipping and storing. Even large
kitchen or trash bags are good for wrapping up posters and large items;
the plastic protects the item from inclement weather by waterproofing it.
✦Two- or three-inch-wide shipping tape: You’ll need clear tape for securing
packages and to place over address labels to protect them from scrapes
and rain. I once received a package with an address label soaked with
rain and barely legible. Don’t risk a lost package for want of a few inches
of tape.
✦Hand-held tape dispenser: You need a way to get the tape off the roll
and onto the box. Using a tape dispenser can be a bit tricky to the unini-
tiated, but once you get than hang of it, you’ll be sealing up boxes in no
time flat!
Shipping in mailing envelopes
You’ll be shipping your stuff in an envelope or a box. Don’t be quick to dis-
count shipping in envelopes. Any item under 13 ounces can be shipped via
First Class mail — and that can represent quite a savings.
Storing pesky packing products
Storing shipping supplies is the tricky part. I
store peanuts in the bags they were shipped in
(note the ones in the figure from Gatorpack) or in
33-gallon plastic trash bags, and then hang the
bags on cup hooks around the garage ceiling.
(By the way, bags of peanuts make great
bumpers in the garage.) To store my bubble
wrap from Bubblefast, I hung a broomstick with
wire from the rafters. I made the broomstick
into a dispenser (of sorts).

Mailing envelopes come in many types of materials. Some are sturdier than
others. Here’s what many eBay sellers use:
✦Polyvinyl envelopes: If you’ve ever ordered clothing or bedding from
any of the television-shopping clubs, this is what they came in. Polyvinyl
envelopes are lightweight and puncture and tear resistant. They are the
most durable envelopes available. Who says you have to ship in boxes?
✦Tyvek envelopes: You know those really cool indestructible white
envelopes you get from the post office or FedEx? They’re made of DuPont
Tyvek, a spun-bonded olefin fiber. Tyvek has all the benefits of vinyl
envelopes, plus it breathes (allows air to reach your product) and has 
a higher strength-to-weight ratio than other envelope materials. (That
ratio business means it’s very strong, yet feather light.)
✦Bubble-padded mailers: These envelopes are lined with small bubbles,
similar to bubble wrap. They’re great for shipping a variety of items and
are the most popular with eBay sellers (see Figure 1-5).
Bubble-lined mailers come in different materials:
• Plain-paper bubble mailers are the cheapest way to go, but they
can be damaged in the mail if you use them to ship heavy items.
The way around that problem is to wrap cheap, clear packing tape
once around the envelope in each direction.
• Vinyl bubble mailers aren’t expensive and are a super protective way
to ship. They’re 15% lighter than paper bubble mailers and are water
resistant.
If you send items that can fit nicely into bubble-padded envelopes, use
them. This type of envelope is perfect for mailing small items or clothing
using First Class mail. The envelopes are available in quantity (an econom-
ical choice) and don’t take up much storage space. Table 1-1 shows you
the industry-standard sizes of bubble envelopes and their suggested use.
Mechanizing your labeling
Printing labels on your printer is convenient
until you start sending out a dozen packages at
a time — then cutting the paper and taping the
label gets too time consuming. Plus, those cut-
out labels are not professional. I highly recom-
mend you do yourself a favor and get a label
printer. Yes, they can be expensive, but you can
find some great deals on eBay. I bought my
heavy-duty, professional Eltron Zebra 2844 ther-
mal label printer on eBay for one-fourth the
retail price. (Search eBay for zebra 2844.) It’s
saved me countless hours. Another good label
printer for beginners is the Dymo LabelWriter.

Depending on the size of the items you sell, you can purchase boxes in bulk at
reliable sources. Because you have a resale number, look in your local yellow
pages for wholesale boxes (you still have to pay tax, but the resale number

identifies you as a business and often can result in lower prices). Try to pur-
chase from a manufacturer that specializes in B2B (business to business)
sales. Some box companies specialize in selling to the occasional box user.
You also need to know a little about what it takes to make a sturdy box.
The de facto standard for quality, general-use shipping boxes is 200-pound
double-wall corrugated.
You can save big money if your items fit into boxes that the post office sup-
plies and you plan on using Priority Mail. The USPS will give you all the
boxes and mailing envelopes you need free, and it offers plenty of sizes.

In 1999, the United States Postal Service announced a new service: information-
based indicia (IBI), postage that you can print on envelopes and labels
right from your PC. In this section, I give you the lowdown on the main
Internet postage vendors: Endicia.com, Stamps.com, and the post office’s
own Click-N-Ship.
I’m a savvy consumer and businesswoman. I don’t believe in paying for
extras, nor do I believe in being a victim of hidden charges. The online
postage arena — while providing helpful tools that make running your eBay
business easier — is fraught with bargains, deals, and introductory offers. I
urge you to read these offers carefully so that you know what you’re getting
yourself into: Evaluate how much it will cost you to start and to maintain an
ongoing relationship with the company. Although you may initially get some
free hardware and pay a low introductory rate, the fine print might tell you
that you have agreed to pay unreasonably high monthly prices six months
down the line. I always double-check pricing before getting into anything,
and I urge you to do the same.

Click-N-Ship from the USPS
Your old pal the United States Postal Service has Web tools that enable you
to print your postage and get delivery confirmation free of charge (that’s
right — no more $.45 each) for Priority Mail and Express Mail items. You
can’t print postage for Media Mail, Parcel Post, or First Class mail through
this service. One caveat: This is a no-frills online service, and you often get
what you pay for. You have to download software to your computer to use
this service, and you can’t print the labels on a label printer. You must print
to regular 81⁄2 x 11 paper.
Click-N-Ship has the following benefits:
✦Online address book: The address book stores up to 1000 addresses.
✦E-mail ship notification: You can send recipients an e-mail notifying
them that a package is on its way.
✦Shipping cart: You can print up to ten domestic labels with a single
credit card transaction.
✦Shipping history section: Your shipping history for the past six months
is stored online for easy access.

At the beginning of PC graphics in the early 90s, I attended a cutting-edge
industry trade show. I had a successful graphics and advertising business,
so I was interested in the latest and greatest innovations to bring my busi-
ness off the light table and onto my computer. In a smallish booth were a
couple of guys peddling new software to enable artists to design direct mail
pieces from the desktop. Wow! What an innovation! Their inexpensive soft-
ware even let you produce your own bar coding for the post office. I fell in
love with that software and used it throughout my graphics career.
Free USPS package pick up
Yes! Some things are free! If you print electronic
postage for just one Priority Mail or Express
Mail package through one of the vendors men-
tioned in this section, you can request a free
pickup for all your packages. Go the post office
Web site at www.usps.com and type carrier

That program, DAZzle, combined with their patented Dial-A-Zip became the
basis for today’s software (see Figure 1-7) that is distributed to all Endicia.com
customers. There isn’t a more robust mailing program on the market.
Endicia.com has all the features of Stamps.com and more:
✦Buy your postage online: With a click of your mouse, you can purchase
your postage instantly using your credit card or by direct debit from your
checking account. You can register your preferences when you sign up
with Endicia.com.
✦Print postage for all classes of mail, including international: From
Anniston, Alabama, to Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, the DaZzle software not
only prints postage but also lists all your shipping options and applica-
ble rates. For international mailing, it also advises you as to any prohibi-
tions (for example, no prison-made goods can be mailed to Botswana),
restrictions, necessary customs forms, and areas served within the
country.
✦Print customs forms: You no longer have to go to the post office with
your international packages. Just print the customs form from the
DAZzle software and give the package to your letter carrier.

✦Free delivery confirmations on Priority mail: Delivery confirmations
may be printed also for First Class, Parcel Post, and Media Mail for only
$.13 each (a savings of $.42 from post office purchases).
✦Mailpiece design: Endicia Internet postage is based on DAZzle, an award-
winning mailpiece design tool that lets you design envelopes, postcards,
and labels with color graphics, logos, pictures, text messages, and rubber
stamps. You can print your mailing label with postage and delivery confir-
mation on anything from plain paper (tape it on with clear tape) to fancy 
4 x 6 labels in a label printer from their extensive list of label templates.
✦Integration with U-PIC insurance: If you’ve saving time and money using
U-PIC (a private package insurer — see Chapter 3), you can send your
monthly insurance logs electronically to U-PIC at the end of the month —
a service integrated into the DAZzle software. There’s no need to print a
hard copy and mail in this information.
✦No cut-and-paste necessary: Endicia integrates with most common 
software programs. With their DAZzle software open on your computer,
highlight the buyer’s address from an e-mail or the PayPal site and press
Ctrl+C. The address automatically appears in the DAZzle postage soft-
ware. No pasting needed.
Endicia.com offers two levels of service. All the features just listed come
with the standard plan. Their premium plan adds customizable e-mail,
enhanced online transaction reports and statistics, business reply mail,
return shipping labels (prepaid so your customer won’t have to pay for the
return), and stealth indicias.
The stealth indicia (also known as the postage-paid indicia) is an awesome tool
for the eBay seller. By using this feature, your customer will not see the exact
amount of postage you paid. This allows you to add reasonable shipping and
handling costs and not inflame the buyer when they see the final label.
Certain levels of electronic postage are permitted by the U.S. Postal Service
to print postage labels without the postage amount. It’s a handy feature that
allows you the privacy of adding handling charges without freaking out the
recipient.
With all these features, you’d think their service would be expensive, but 
it’s not. The standard plan is $9.95 a month ($99.95 if paid annually), and the
premium plan is $15.95 a month ($174.94 annually). For a free 60-day trial

PayPal shipping services
PayPal continues to add great features for sellers. Now you can not only buy
postage and ship with UPS through PayPal but also print labels on your own
printer. If you ship lots of items and use a different service for printing your
postage, PayPal allows you to input the tracking information on the site. Just
click the Details link for the transaction, and then click the Add button that
appears, as shown in Figure 1-8. Input the USPS, UPS, or other shipping com-
pany tracking or delivery confirmation information, and PayPal sends an
e-mail to your buyer with that information.
The information you added appears in both the record of your PayPal 
transaction and the buyer’s record in their account, as shown in Figure 1-9.
(You can check the information by clicking the Details link again.)
When using PayPal’s shipping, you incur some extra charges. To print First
Class, Parcel Post, and Media Mail labels, there is a processing fee of $0.20
per label and a $0.13 charge for the delivery confirmation service. The other
online postage services do not charge the processing fee. If you’re shipping
50 items a month in those classes of postage, the fees can easily pay for the
more robust service you get from Endicia.com.
PayPal shipping services work great when you’re just starting out in your eBay
business, but after you get rolling, you need a mailing service that includes
e-mail and record-keeping, such as Endicia.com or Stamps.com. The issue
in using PayPal for shipping is an important one. When you process your

shipping (UPS or USPS) on PayPal, the shipping amount is deducted from your
PayPal (sales revenue) balance.
If you’re starting a business in earnest, you need to keep track of your online
expenses separately. Allowing PayPal to deduct your shipping costs from your
incoming revenue creates a bookkeeping nightmare. You need to have exact
figures for expenses and income — and it helps keep confusion to a minimum
when your deposits (withdrawals from your PayPal account to your bank)
match your sales receipts. If you want to ship through PayPal, be sure you
withdraw your sales amount to your checking account before you process
your shipping. That way, your shipping can be charged to your business
credit card for easier tracking.
To purchase postage and print your label for a specific purchase, click the
Ship button next to the payment record in your PayPal account overview, 
as shown in Figure 1-10. You’ll be taken through a step-by-step process for
paying for your shipping and printing the appropriate label on your printer.
Stamps.com
Stamps.com purchased 31 Internet postage patents from e-stamp, making its
services a combination of the best of both sites. (e-stamp discontinued its
online postage service late in 2000; I was a big fan.) Many eBay sellers moved
their postage business over to Stamps.com.

Stamps.com works with software that you probably use every day, such as
Microsoft Word, Outlook, and Office; Corel WordPerfect; Palm Desktop; and
Quicken. Here are some features you might enjoy:
✦Use your printer to print postage: If your printer allows it, you can 
even print your envelopes along with bar-coded addresses, your return
address, and postage. This saves quite a bit in label costs.
The Stamps.com Envelope Wizard permits you to design your own
envelopes, including a logo or graphics. You can purchase a box of 500
#10 envelopes for as little as $4.99 at an office supply store. (Endicia.com
provides a more robust envelope graphics wizard.)
✦Have Stamps.com check that your addresses are valid: Before printing
any postage, the Stamps.com software contacts the USPS database of
every valid mailing address in the United States. This Address Matching
System (AMS) is updated monthly.
✦Have Stamps.com add the extra four digits to your addressee’s zip code:
This nifty feature helps ensure swift delivery while freeing you of the
hassle of having to look up the information.
Purchasing postage is as easy as going to www.stamps.com and clicking 
your mouse. Your credit card information is kept secure on its site. With
Stamps.com, you don’t need any extra fancy equipment, although most 
introductory deals come with a free 5-pound-maximum scale. The scale
also functions on its own. Serious users should get a better-quality postage
scale from a seller on eBay or through Office Depot.
Because Office Depot delivers any order more than $50 free the next day, it’s
a great place to get paper and labels. Better buys on scales, though, can be
found on eBay, especially if you search postage scale. I use a super small, 
13-pound-maximum scale manufactured by Escali that I bought on eBay for
only $29.95, complete with a five-year warranty.
Stamps.com charges a flat rate of $15.99 per month. The site regularly offers
sign-up bonuses that include as much as $20.00 free postage or a free 5-pound-
maximum digital postage scale. To find the Stamps.com deal of the month,
visit its Web site.

I
think the best part of eBay is making the sale and receiving payment.
After that comes the depressing and tedious process of fulfilling your
orders. You shouldn’t feel bad if this is the point that makes you take pause
and sigh. Order fulfillment is one of the biggest problems (and yuckiest
chores) that face any mail order or online enterprise.
But as an eBay businessperson, you must attend to these tasks, however
much you’d rather not. In this chapter, you explore your shipping options.
I give you the lowdown on the three major carriers — FedEx, UPS, and the
U.S. Postal Service — so you can see who fits your requirements. (For the
scoop on insurance coverage, see Chapter 3.) 
Shipping: The Heart of Your Business
Shipping can be the most time-consuming (and dreaded) task for eBay sellers.
Even if the selling portion of your transaction goes flawlessly, the item has
to get to the buyer in one piece. If it doesn’t, the deal could be ruined — and
so could your reputation.
The best way to avoid shipping problems is to do your homework beforehand,
determine which method is likely to work best, and spell out in your item
description exactly how you intend to ship the item. I always say “Buyer
pays shipping, handling, and optional insurance” in my item description,
and that’s what I charge, although I can make allowances if the buyer wants
a specific method of shipment within reason. 

Shipping: The Heart of Your Business
602
Shipping is the heart of a mail order business like yours and can make or
break a successful transaction. Don’t even think of selling an item without
evaluating your shipping options:
1. After the auction, get the package ready to ship.
You don’t have to seal the package right away, but you should have it
ready to seal because the two critical factors in shipping are weight and
time. The more a package weighs and the faster it has to be delivered,
the higher the charge. The time to think about packing and shipping is
before you put the item up for auction.
2. Know your carrier options.
In the United States, the three main shipping options for most eBay
transactions are the U.S. Postal Service, FedEx, and UPS. See the section
“Shopping for a Shipper” (try saying that five times fast) for information
on how you can get rate options from each service, painlessly and online. 
US postage at a big discount!
I just had to share this with you! The figure
shows a picture of an envelope I received on
an eBay purchase. I had to e-mail the seller to
find out how and why she used so many stamps.
The seller is a collector of US postage. She
checks out eBay auctions and buys deals on
old sheets of mint state stamps. United States
stamps, no matter how old, are always good, so
she buys these stamps at discount and uses
them on her eBay packages. However, she did
mention that when she brings her packages to
the post office, all the clerks scatter to take a
break!

Chapter 2

Shipping: The Heart of Your Business
603
3. Before quoting the shipping fees, make sure that you include all
appropriate costs.
I recommend that you charge a nominal handling fee (up to $1.50 isn’t
out of line — even more under special circumstances) to cover your
packing materials, which can add up quickly as you start making multiple
transactions. You should also include any insurance costs and delivery-
confirmation costs. For more on insurance and deliver confirmation, see
Chapter 3.
eBay’s policy reads: “Sellers may charge a reasonable shipping and han-
dling fee to the final price of their item, provided that this fee is disclosed
up front in the listing. A shipping and handling fee can cover the seller’s
reasonable costs for mailing, packaging and handling the item. Shipping
and handling fees cannot be listed as a percentage of the final sale price.”
It’s best to post a flat shipping amount (or use the eBay online shipping
calculator) to give buyers an idea of how much shipping will be. This way,
buyers can include this cost when they consider their bidding strategies.
Figure out what the packed item will weigh and then estimate shipping
costs; the online calculators can help. If the item is particularly heavy
and you need to use a specialized shipping, be sure to say in your auction
description that you’re just giving an estimate and that the final cost will
be determined after the auction is over. Optionally, you could tell the
bidder how much the item weighs, where you’re shipping from, and what
your handling charges are (a few bidders don’t mind doing the math).
Occasionally, shipping calculations can be off-target, and you may not
know that until after you take the buyer’s money. If the mistake is in your
favor and is a biggie, notify the buyer and offer a refund. But if shipping
ends up costing you a bit more, take your lumps and pay it. You can
always let the buyer know what happened and that you paid the extra
cost. Who knows, it may show up on your feedback from the buyer!
(Even if it doesn’t, spreading goodwill never hurts.)
4. E-mail the buyer and congratulate him or her on winning; reiterate
your shipping choice and how long you expect shipping will take.
Make sure you’re both talking about the same timetable. If the buyer
balks at either the price or the shipping time, try working out an option
that will make the buyer happy.
5. Send the package.
When should you ship the package? Common courtesy says it should go
out as soon as the item and shipping charges are paid. If the buyer has
followed through with his or her side of the bargain, you should do the
same. Ship that package no more than a day or so after payment (or after
the check clears). If you can’t, immediately e-mail the buyer and explain
the delay.

Shopping for a Shipper
604
Send a prompt follow-up e-mail to let the buyer know the item’s on the way.
In this e-mail, include when the item was sent, how long it should take to
arrive, any special tracking number (if you have one), and a request for a
return e-mail confirming arrival after the item gets there. I also include a
thank-you note (a receipt would be a businesslike addition) in each package
I send out. I appreciate when I get one in eBay packages, and it always brings
a smile to the recipient’s face. It never hurts to take every opportunity to
promote goodwill (and future business and positive feedback).
More often than not, you do get an e-mail back from the buyer to let you
know the item arrived safely. If you don’t, it doesn’t hurt to send another
e-mail (in about a week) to ask whether the item arrived in good condition. It
jogs the buyer’s memory and demonstrates your professionalism as a seller.
Use this opportunity to gently remind buyers that you’ll be leaving positive
feedback for them. Ask whether they’re satisfied and don’t be bashful about
suggesting they do the same for you. Leave positive feedback right away so
that you don’t forget.
Shopping for a Shipper
When you’re considering shipping options, you must first determine what
types of packages you’ll generally be sending (small packages that weigh
less than two pounds or large and bulky packages) and then decide how
you’ll send your items. Planning this before listing the item is a good idea.
Deciding on your carrier can be the most important decision in your eBay
business. You need to decide which one is more convenient for you (located
close to your home base, provides pick up service, gives better customer
service) and which is the most economical. Settling on one main shipper to
meet most of your needs is important because all your records will be on
one statement or in one area. However, you might also need a secondary
shipper for special types of packages. 
Shipping can make or break your customer service. Whoever delivers the
package to the buyer is an extension of your company. Professional labels,
clean boxes, nifty packing peanuts — those are the things you control. Safe
and timely delivery falls into the hands of complete strangers, but the buyer
will blame you for the tardiness or sloppiness of the shipping. Your bottom
line isn’t the shipper’s, and no matter how many refunds they offer when
they don’t meet their promised schedules, it won’t help when you have irate
customers. Simple equation: Irate customers = lousy feedback.
So, what’s a seller to do? Do you use the shipper that other sellers rave
about? Perhaps opt for convenience or low price? Once you decide on a
shipper, how often do you reevaluate it’s services? 

Book VII
Chapter 2

605
The rest of the chapter will help you with this decision.
Meeting your front line
Who constitutes the front line of your eBay business? My shipping front
line is Scott, the UPS man; Tim, the post office carrier; and Jorge, who picks
up for FedEx Ground. I know the front-line guys because they help my eBay
business run smoothly. They don’t leave deliveries outside under a bush,
and they always deliver packages to my neighbor if I’m not home. They
pick up my sundry packages with a smile and a lighthearted “They’re sure
buying things on eBay, aren’t they?” I respond with a smile and a bit of
friendly chit chat.
Wait, are you telling me that you don’t get the same service? Have you ever
taken a moment to chat with your delivery person? When you personalize a
business relationship (such as addressing them by name), you become more
than a street address, you become . . . well . . . a person. When you’re no longer
a number, you become a fellow human being with needs and wants. Believe
it or not, people want to make other people happy.
I leave a signal when there are packages to be picked up, and every one is
picked up. When somebody delivers a big box, it goes to the back door near
my studio, so I don’t have to drag it through the front door and across the
house.
Try building a relationship with your shipping front line. I’ve invited them to
company holiday parties and offered them a cool drink on a hot summer day.
The result? My shipping is the easiest part of my business.
Location, location, location
What happens if you have to drop off your packages for shipment? It’s impor-
tant to consider the closest local drop-off point for your carrier. Each of the
major carriers has a search feature on its Web site to find the nearest drop-
off location. You input your address or zip code, and the feature tells you the
locations closest to you.
To get the location lowdown quickly, go to the following sites:
✦FedEx: www.fedex.com/us/dropoff
✦USPS: www.mapsonus.com/db/USPS/
✦UPS: www.ups.com/dropoff?loc=en_US

Shopping for a Shipper
606
Be sure to read the details about each location online. Different fees may be
involved in dropping off packages. Some locations may accept certain types
of packages and not others. Read the fine print.
Comparing prices
The consensus is that a particular method of shipping is cheaper for large
items and another is cheaper for small packages. Each method has its own
peculiarities. 
Take a look at Table 2-1 and compare the pricing for certain types of packages.
Know that there are extras for some services, so become familiar with the
variations and hidden costs. For example, FedEx and UPS include tracking
numbers for delivery confirmation, but USPS charges extra (delivery confir-
mation is $.45 for Priority Mail and $.55 for Media Mail, First Class, and
Parcel Post).

realize that USPS charges only a tad more money for 2- to 3-day Priority Mail
service over Parcel Post.

You, Too, Can Use Federal Express
607
You, Too, Can Use Federal Express
Federal Express, or FedEx as it’s known to everyone, is world famous for
its reliable service. It’s the number-one choice for all major companies
who “Absolutely, positively have to get it there on time.” FedEx also has a
reputation for some of the highest costs in the business — but only to the
untrained eye. FedEx acquired Roadway Package Service (RPS) and formed
FedEx Ground, which has a separate division called FedEx Home Delivery
that delivers to residences. For the services they provide, you’ll be happy to
pay what you do. Read on.
FedEx Ground and Home Delivery
When Home Delivery began, their slogan was “The neighborhood friendly
service that fits the way we live, work, and shop today.” Although I rarely get
warm fuzzies from my package delivery, this slogan brought meaning to the
philosophy behind their service: to bring professional shipping to your home
residence. FedEx Home Delivery offers low rates and high-quality service.
They’re the only shipper that offers a money-back guarantee on home serv-
ice. They deliver until 8 p.m. and on Saturdays, but not on Mondays.

Shipping the BIG stuff!
When it comes to shipping heavy or big stuff, you
have a few options. Because I like using FedEx,
I check with FedEx Freight first. My husband
once purchased four large heavy-equipment
tires on eBay, and there was no way they could
go with a regular carrier. We told the seller to
place the tires on a pallet and secure them.
They were picked up by FedEx Freight. Shipping
was reasonable, but the caveat was that the
shipment had to be delivered to a place of busi-
ness, not a residential location.
The www.freightquote.com Web site
negotiates rates with several major freight for-
warders. Before attempting to sell a heavy item,
sign onto their Web site with the weight and
dimensions of your shipment, and they’ll give
you a free quote on the spot.

Even if you have a current Federal Express account, you need to sign on to
add the Ground service (which includes Home Delivery). Registering for
Ground service is even easier than registering on eBay, so give it a shot.
(Check the next section to see how easy it is.)
I opened my FedEx Home Delivery account through a link on the FedEx home
page, and got the skinny on how to use the service. FedEx Home Delivery
gives you a service schedule to let you know how long it will take your pack-
age to arrive at its destination (see Figure 2-2). The online calculator allows
you to choose the option of home delivery, so you don’t even have to look
up alternative rates and charts.

Here are a few fast facts about FedEx Ground and Home Delivery services:
✦You print your own labels and barcodes for your packages and track
them online.
✦FedEx Home Delivery works on a zone system based on your zip code
and how far the package is going. Refer to the FedEx Home Delivery zone
chart or get the cost online through the online calculator.
✦Each shipment is covered for $100.00 in declared value. Additional insur-
ance is $.35 per $100.00 or a fraction thereof.
✦Residential deliveries are limited to 70-pound packages.
✦Daily pick-up service adds an additional weekly charge of $10.00 to your
account.
✦Dropping off packages at Federal Express counters (this includes all
those handy FedEx Kinko’s locations) incurs no additional charge.
To find the closest drop-off location for your FedEx packages, go to www.
fedex.com/us/dropoff and type your zip code. Check that the location
accepts Ground, and check the cutoff times. To find FedEx Kinko’s locations,
go to www.kinkos.com/locations/.
Signing up with FedEx
You sign up for a FedEx account only once, but it’s a two-step process. First
you sign up for a Web site login, and then you sign up for an actual, for-real
FedEx account. After you have a fedex.com login and account, you’ll be able
to ship your items quickly from your own private FedEx Web space.
To get a FedEx account and be able to ship right away, follow these steps:
1. Go to www.fedex.com/us.
2. On the left side of the screen, click the FedEx Ground link.
The FedEx Ground page appears.
3. From the FedEx Ground page, click the Ship tab, at the top.
You’ll land at the login page. If you’ve previously signed up for an
account with a password and user ID, you can log in immediately here. 
4. If you’re signing up for a new account, click the Sign Up Now! link.

5. On the resulting registration page, type the following information:
• User ID: Make up an ID you’ll remember. (I tried my eBay user ID and
it was already taken — I guess they have lots of customers.)
• Password: Come up with a password you’ll remember. For tips on
selecting safe passwords, see Book IX, Chapter 4.
• Password reminder: Input your password reminder question and
answer. This way, if you ever forget your password or have to prove
your identity to FedEx, you’ll have a mind jogger.
• Contact information: Type your name, company name (optional),
address, city, state, e-mail address, and phone number.
• Agree to the terms of use: If you want to ship via FedEx, you must
agree to their terms. Click the link provided if you want some boring
legalese to read. When you decide to play by their rules, click I Accept.
6. Read the FedEx License Agreement (I’m sure you’ll read every word)
and then click Yes, indicating that you accept the Agreement.
Next you’re asked whether you have a FedEx account number.
7. Click the Open a FedEx Account link. 
8. Follow the prompts and input your credit card information.
Finally, you’re presented with your very own nine-digit FedEx account
number! 
If you want to ship something now, click Start Using FedEx Ship Manager.
Otherwise, log in later when you’re ready to ship.
FedEx online
FedEx has one of the most intuitive online applications for shipping. The
FedEx Ship Manager interface will turn your computer into a one-person
shipping shop. You can search for rate quotes, track packages, and use the
shipping notification option to send tracking information e-mails to your
recipients.
To ship your item from the FedEx Web site, just go to the online Ship Manager
by clicking the Ship tab. You’ll be presented with a simple, all-in-one online
waybill, similar to the one you fill out by hand. Figure 2-3 shows you what it
looks like.
You can copy and paste addresses from your PayPal account into the online
form. Just highlight the text you want to copy and press Ctrl+C. To paste the
text, place your cursor in the area you want to fill and press Ctrl+V.

When you’re filling out the form, note some important entries:
✦Service type: If you’re shipping to a residence, use the FedEx Home
Delivery option from the drop-down list.
✦Dimensions: Be sure that you know the proper dimensions for the pack-
age you’re sending.
If you sell repeat items in your eBay business, why not measure the boxes
ahead of time and keep a list near your computer so you’ll know the size?
For example: Light kit 14x12x26.
✦FedEx ShipAlert: Select the e-mail option to send the buyer (and your-
self) a notice that the package was shipped. Add a personal message so
that the e-mail won’t have a cold automated feel to it.
After you fill out the form, you can click the Courtesy Rate button at the
bottom to get a shipping cost estimate (not including any special discounts).
When shipping with FedEx online, if your package is valued over $100.00 and
you use U-PIC for your insurance (see Chapter 3), put $0 in the Declared Value
box. Make note of the package on an insurance log and submit it to U-PIC.
(FedEx charges $.50 cents per $100.00 in value but U-PIC charges only $.15
per $100.00.)

I’m a big fan of the U.S. Postal Service. Just ask my wonderful letter (er, mul-
tiple parcel) carrier, Tim. I use the post office for the bulk of my eBay sales
because it’s convenient. In my eight years selling items on eBay, they’ve
never lost a package. 
The USPS is open to everyone. You don’t have to set up an account to use its
services. To get a basic idea of what you’ll pay to send a package, you can
access a rate calculator on the USPS Web site (www.usps.com), shown in
Figure 2-4.

Convenient and fast
The post office has worked hard to keep up with the competition in the
parcel business by offering many online features and custom pickup. They
also offer many classes of service, with a weight maximum of 70 pounds.
Table 2-2 shows the services that are most popular with eBay sellers.
Table 2-2
Most Popular USPS Services
Service
Time to Cross the 
What You Can Ship
Country (Days)
First Class
3–5
First Class mail can be used to mail anything, as long as
it weighs 13 ounces or less. You can send a letter, a
large envelope, or a small package. 
Priority Mail

Priority Mail is just First Class mail on steroids (for heav-
ier items). 
Parcel Post

Parcel Post is cheaper (and slower) than Priority Mail.
Media Mail

Media Mail is the least expensive way to mail heavy
items. The only caveat is that you can use Media Mail to
ship only books, film, manuscripts, printed music, printed
test materials, sound recordings, scripts, and computer-
recorded media such as CD-ROMs and diskettes.
Read on for details on the most popular forms of mail used by eBay sellers.
First Class
Good old regular mail, First Class is the way we send bills and letters. It works
also as an economical alternative for eBay items up to 13 ounces. When you
print your postage online with some services, you can get a delivery confir-
mation for First Class mail for only $.13.
Priority Mail
The 2- to 3-day Priority Mail service is the most popular form of shipping for
eBay packages. You can get free cartons, mailing tape, and labels from the
post office. (See Chapter 1 for a complete list of what the USPS supplies for
your mailing needs.) You can also print postage online through endicia.com
or stamps.com (see Chapter 1 again).
The Priority Mail rates are perfect for 1-pound packages ($3.85 flat-rate cross-
country) and 2-pound packages (from $3.95, based on distance). They also
have a flat-rate Priority envelope in which you can jam in as much as possible
(regardless of the package’s final weight) for $3.85. 

Shipping with USPS
614
Because USPS rates are based on distance and weight, you can save money
by using their new flat-rate Priority Mail boxes. I’ve been able to jam quite a
bit into them and it’s a deal at a flat $7.70 anywhere in the United States.
The Priority Mail rates (including free shipping materials) are attractive until
you get into heavier packages. Also, if you don’t print your postage online,
delivery confirmation costs you an additional $.45 for Priority Mail ($.55 for
Parcel Post and Media Mail). Delivery confirmation tells you only if the pack-
age was delivered; it doesn’t trace the package along its route.
Parcel Post
If you want to use the USPS and have a heavy package (up to 70 pounds) that
doesn’t fit the requirements for Media Mail, use Parcel Post. However, USPS
Parcel Post rates don’t cut it when you compare them to the UPS or FedEx
Ground rates.
Media Mail
To stay new and hip, the post office has renamed its old Book Rate to Media
Mail, causing many eBay sellers to mistakenly miss out on this valuable mail-
ing tool. The savings are immense. The drawback is that you must mail only
books, cassettes, videos, or computer-readable media. Transit time on Media
Mail is 7 to 10 days, but the cost savings on heavy packages are worth it. 
Understanding the costs
The Postal Service levies additional charges for some often-used services
but also gives free services to online postage customers:
✦Pickup: If you have a postal license and print your own postage from an
online service (see Chapter 1) or print direct from eBay or the PayPal
site, the post office offers free pickup, as shown in Figure 2-5. You have
to give your packages to your carrier at the time of your regular delivery
or schedule a pickup on the USPS site at 
http://www.usps.com/shipping/carrierpickup/welcome.htm
✦Insurance: This guarantees that you’re covered if your package doesn’t
arrive safely and will reimburse you up to the value you declare when
purchasing the insurance, up to a maximum of $5000.00. If your package
gets lost or severely mangled in shipping, the Postal Service will, after
a thorough investigation (see Chapter 3), pay your claim. Fees start at
$1.30 for packages up to $50.00, and $2.20 for packages up to $100.00.
You can then add $1.00 for each $100.00 of insured value. For discounted
insurance, read Chapter 3. 

Book VII

✦Delivery confirmation: Delivery confirmation provides you with proof
of delivery or attempted delivery. You can purchase delivery confirma-
tions for $.45 (for Priority Mail) or $.55 (Parcel Post) at the post office
when you mail a package. They provide you with a tracking number that
you can check online at
www.usps.com/shipping/trackandconfirm.htm
You can also verify a package’s delivery by calling a toll-free number,
800-222-1811.
If you aren’t shipping a great many items each week, you can get free
delivery confirmation by visiting the Print Shipping Labels area of the
post office Web site at
https://sss-web.usps.com/ds/jsps/ds_landing.jsp
You can generate a custom barcode mailing label with a delivery confir-
mation number for Priority Mail packages (see Figure 2-6). You can print
these labels directly from your inkjet or laser printer, and then simply
tape the label to your package. (You can also print your own postage;
check out Chapter 1 for details.)
Because you’re in business and need to keep records of your shipments
(dates, weights, and confirmation numbers), this method may not be the
way to go. The post office site, although free, prints only a one-time label.
If you want to keep records, you’ll have to input the information sepa-
rately in a spreadsheet or a text file.

DHL SmartMail
The United States Postal Service is the nation’s
largest transportation entity, delivering to close
to 130 million addresses per day. The USPS
sought partners who could help with long-haul
transportation of the mail; the USPS would
handle the local delivery. In 1996, DHL
SmartMail signed on as a forwarder of mail.
They ship mail — envelopes or parcels — from
high-volume shippers.
Many high-level PowerSellers take advantage
of the DHL SmartMail service. When you’re
sending out hundreds of small items a day, you
can save big time using this service for your
shipping. For more information, visit their Web

Getting on the UPS Bandwagon
617
Just type your zip code and the site will generate a custom zone chart for
your mailing location.
Getting on the UPS Bandwagon
Today’s UPS is a $30 billion company focusing on enabling commerce
around the world. Every day UPS delivers more than 13.3 million packages
and documents — I’m sure much of which represents eBay transactions. 
UPS considers neither Saturday nor Sunday to be delivery days. So when your
package is quoted for a 5-day delivery and the 5 days cross over a weekend,
add 2 days to the delivery schedule. (The USPS and FedEx Ground deliver on
Saturday.)
Here are some quick facts about UPS:
✦Shipping with UPS requires that you pay a different rate for different
zones in the country (zones 1–8). The cost of your package is based on
its weight, your zip code (where there package ships from), and the
addressee’s zip code (where the package is going). To figure out your
cost, use the handy UPS cost calculator shown in Figure 2-7.
✦UPS offers a chart that defines the shipping time for your ground 
shipments.
✦Each package has a tracking number that you can input online to verify
location and time of delivery.
✦Delivery to a residence costs over $1.00 per pound more than delivery
to a commercial location.
✦UPS delivers packages Monday through Friday.
Comparing costs
Although we always complain when the U.S. Postal Service raises their
rates, you should know that all other shipping carriers raise their rates
every year.
Annual rate increases are why being lulled into complacency can be dangerous.
Evaluate your shipping charges and your shipper’s fees every year to keep
up with the increases and possible cuts into your bottom line.

Getting on the UPS Bandwagon
618
UPS charges a different rate for home delivery than they do for deliveries to
a business. In their last rate increase, residential delivery took the biggest
hit. The premium for Home Delivery rose 22%; the previous year it was 4.5%.
That’s a raise from $1.10 to $1.40 in just two years.
While we all think that UPS Ground is cheaper than the post office, it’s not
true in every case. 
Every UPS package is automatically insured for up to $100 assuming you
declare a value. Insurance up to the first $300 is $1.20. After the first $300 it
runs $.40 per $100. The post office charges extra for the service, but you can
save money either way by using a private insurance policy for your packages
(see Chapter 3).
The de facto standard for eBay shipping is Priority Mail. Compared to UPS 
3-Day Select, Priority Mail is the clear cost-saving winner if you must ship
packages for swift delivery.
For heavier packages, UPS is considerably cheaper than Parcel Post for pack-
ages over 6 pounds. After your packages pass that point, and if time is not of
the essence, UPS may be the best way to go.

Variable UPS rates
When you ship via UPS and are trying to figure out how to get the best rates,
you have quite a conundrum. UPS basically has three rates for small-time
shippers:
✦Retail rate: This is the rate you pay when you go to the UPS Customer
Center and they create the label for you. It’s the most expensive. With
the eBay/PayPal solution, you can save yourself some bucks by printing
your own barcoded labels and dropping the packages at the Customer
Center or giving the packages to a UPS driver. 
✦On demand rate: Use UPS for the rare large box or heavy shipment. An
on demand, or occasional, shipper can call UPS for a next-day pickup.
You have to pay an additional $4 per package for the driver to pick up from
you if you don’t feel like bringing the package to the UPS local counter.
✦Pickup account: When you hit the big time, you’re able to get the lowest
UPS rates and have a driver make daily stops to pick up your packages.
Fees for a pickup account run from $7 to $16 per week (based on the
amount of packages you ship each week) over the cost of your package
shipping. 
Saving by getting heavier packages picked up
Are you suffering from the delusion that it costs a bundle to have regular
UPS package pickup service? (I was, too.) Surprise, it doesn’t, as you’ll see.
As shown in Table 2-3, fees for UPS pickup service are on a sliding scale from
$7.00 to $16.00, based on the amount of postage that you use in a week.
Shipping seven 10-pound packages coast-to-coast or eight 5-pound packages
would easily meet the weekly minimum of $60.00 in postage. If you’re selling
heavier items on eBay, UPS service with package pickup wins over the post
office, hands down!

15.00–59.99

60.00 and up

If you have daily pickup service, you’d net a savings of close to $2 per pack-
age, as shown in Table 2-4. You must print your labels directly from the UPS
Web site and have a preprinted manifest ready for the driver.

Shipping Directly from PayPal
I consider PayPal to be de rigueur (a must have, to all you non-French speak-
ers) for all eBay sellers. By using PayPal, a seller can streamline the buyer’s
shopping experience, making it simple to buy, click, and pay. Those out in
the eBay world who haven’t used PayPal find using the service to be a life-
changing experience. Along with all the timesaving tools PayPal supplies for
the seller, they now offer online shipping services for items through the
United States Postal Service or UPS at no extra charge. This is a convenient
system for those who don’t ship many packages each week because there’s
no need to use additional software or sign up with an additional service. 
But (I hate the buts, don’t you?) the PayPal postage system can make book-
keeping a nightmare for large-scale shippers. That’s because PayPal withdraws
the postage amounts directly from your PayPal account balance. This is
problematic because your books won’t balance: Your final deposits won’t
match your posted eBay or Web sales. 
You can make this work more efficiently by posting your PayPal sales to your
bookkeeping program and then withdrawing your money before processing
your shipping. Then, simply charge your shipping to a credit card, which will
help you balance your books at month’s end. 
When you’re ready to deal with shipping, you simply sign on to your PayPal
account and handle it right on the site. To begin the shipping process, follow
these steps:
1. Log on to your PayPal account page.

2. Click the Ship button next to the item in the row. 
You arrive at the page shown in Figure 2-8.
3. Choose which method of shipping you’d like to use: U.S. Postal
Service or UPS.
PayPal shipping with the USPS
If you plan to use the ever-popular United States Postal Service, printing
your postage and label through PayPal gives you a free delivery confirmation
with Priority Mail. A delivery confirmation is available also for Media Mail,
Parcel Post, and First Class mail for a minimal charge.
After you’ve chosen USPS as your shipper, you’ll see a confirmation page
similar to the one shown in Figure 2-9. At the top of the page (not pictured)
your mailing address and the ship-to address are listed. After you’ve confirmed
that this information is correct, fill out the details of the form, including:
✦Service type: Choose the level of mailing service you want for your
package from this drop-down list. Priority Mail is usually the standard.
✦Package size: From this drop-down list, select the type of package
you’re sending. Keep the following in mind:
• Package/thick envelope: Your package or envelope qualifies for
this status if the length and girth (all the way around) is no more
than 84 inches.
• Large package: Your package is larger than the preceding category,
but doesn’t exceed 108 inches in combined length and girth.
Figure 2-8:

• USPS flat-rate envelope: These are handy Express and Priority Mail
envelopes (available free from the USPS; see Chapter 1 for informa-
tion on how to get them delivered to your door). They allow you to
ship whatever fits into the envelopes at a flat rate, no matter how
much the package weighs. (If you really stuff them, you can always
reinforce your envelope with clear shipping tape — I do!)
✦Weight: Here you enter the weight of your package. 
✦Delivery confirmation: Confirmation is free with Priority Mail.
✦Signature confirmation: Signature confirmation provides you a signa-
ture and date of delivery and is available for many levels of service. If
you’d like a signature confirmation for your package, it will add $1.30 to
the postage cost. You can request proof of delivery from the USPS online
or on the phone.
✦Display value of postage on label: If you’d prefer not to show the
amount of the postage on the label, do not check this box. That way,
whatever handling fees you charge your customer are transparent.
✦E-mail message to buyer: Customer service to the fore! Type a nice note
letting customers know you appreciate their business. This might also
be a good place to ask them to e-mail you immediately if there are any
problems with the item when it arrives (a good defense against knee-jerk
negative feedback).
✦Item(s) being shipped to your buyer: In this area you see the item
number and name of the item you’re shipping.

PayPal shipping with UPS
Shippers such as UPS charge different rates based on how often you use
their services. If you’re shipping many packages a week, it might be best if
you print your labels directly from the UPS site. All PayPal UPS shipments
are charged the occasional shipper rate. If you only use UPS once in a while,
the PayPal method will work perfectly for you. 
If you’ve selected UPS as your shipper on the PayPal Shipping page, you will
be brought to a page with these choices:
✦UPS account: You can open a new UPS account immediately online or, if
you have an existing UPS account number, you may type it in this field.
To open a new account you’ll have to verify your company data (it’s
already entered here from your PayPal account information) and let
UPS know approximately how many packages you ship a week. 
✦Shipping payment information: You also have to indicate whether
you’d like to pay for your shipping with your PayPal account, or if you’d
like the shipping billed to your existing UPS account. 
When you’ve finished filling in the form, finish by following these steps:
1. Click Continue. 
You’ll see a confirmation page. 
2. If the information is correct, click Continue.
If any information is wrong, click Edit and go back and make your 
corrections.
3. If the shipping agreement appears, read it and, if you agree, click I
Agree.
Now you’re ready to print a label. 
4. Fill out the requested information.
5. Print the sample label.
By printing a sample label, you make sure that your printer is working
properly. 
6. Print the label by clicking Print Label.

 Filing a claim with the major carriers
W
hen someone buys an item from you, the buyer assumes that the
item will be shipped in 24 to 48 hours. A little-known rule of the
online world is the Federal Trade Commission’s 30-day mail-order rule. This
rule applies to all online sales, as well as mail-order businesses. It states
that unless you state a specific shipping time, all items must be shipped
within 30 days.
Adopted in 1975, the FTC rule proclaims:
✦You must receive the merchandise when the seller says you will.
✦If you are not promised delivery within a certain time period, the seller
must ship the merchandise to you no later than 30 days after your order.
✦If you don’t receive the merchandise within that 30-day period, you can
cancel your order and get your money back.
This rule must be part of the reason why eBay won’t allow items on the site
for presale (or drop-shipping) unless you can guarantee that the item will be
shipped within 30 days. In each of those cases, you must indicate in your
description that the item is a presale or drop-ship.
Another thing comes to light here. Note that the rule states that the merchan-
dise must be delivered in 30 days. The rule doesn’t say “unless the item gets
lost in the mail.” This means that you, the seller, are responsible for your
packages arriving at their destination. This makes insurance more impor-
tant than ever, especially on expensive items.

When you’re shipping a large amount of merchandise on a regular basis,
you’re going to have to deal with the issue of whether or not you offer
buyers insurance against damage or loss. Either way, you (the seller) are
responsible for getting the product to the buyer. The lost-in-the-mail excuse
doesn’t cut the mustard, and having a delivery confirmation number doesn’t
guarantee anything either.
You may think that it’s the buyers’ responsibility to pay for insurance.
If they don’t, you say, it’s their hard luck if the package doesn’t arrive. 
This is far from the truth; buyers who don’t receive an item that they’ve
paid for can file a fraud report against you. Buyers can also have the 
payment removed from your PayPal account, and you have no defense
against this.
Again, you’d best realize that the responsibility for delivering the goods is
in the seller’s hands. So, offering insurance to your buyers is good business,
and including insurance with every shipment is excellent business.
Insuring your peace of mind (and your shipment)
Sure, “lost in the mail” is an excuse we’ve all
heard hundreds of times, but despite everyone’s
best efforts, sometimes things do get damaged
or misplaced during shipment. The universe is
a dangerous place; that’s why we have insur-
ance. I usually offer to get insurance from the
shipper if the buyer wants to pay for it, and I
always get it on expensive, one-of-a-kind, or
very fragile items. In my item description, I spell
out that the buyer pays for insurance.
The major shippers offer insurance that’s fairly
reasonably priced, so check out their rates at
their Web sites. But don’t forget to read the
details. For example, many items on eBay are
sold MIMB (mint in mint box). True, the condi-
tion of the original box often has a bearing on
the final value of the item inside, but the U.S.
Postal Service insures only what is in the box.
So, if you sold a Malibu Barbie mint in a mint box,
USPS insures only the doll and not the original
box. Pack carefully so that your buyer gets
what’s been paid for. Be mindful that shippers
won’t make good on insurance claims if they
suspect that you caused the damage by doing
a lousy job of packing.
Alternatively, when you’re selling on eBay in
earnest, you can purchase your own parcel
protection policy from a private insurer. When
you use this type of insurance, combined with
preprinted electronic postage, you no longer
have to stand in line at the post office to have
your insured packaged logged in by the clerk at
the counter.

Item’s Delivery

Self-insuring your items
Some sellers on eBay self-insure their packages. In other words, they take
the risk and use money out of their own pockets if they have to pay a claim.
In this sense, self-insuring is considered seller’s jargon, not an official legal
status (only licensed insurance agents can offer insurance).
These sellers are usually careful about packing their items to prevent damage.
(Check out Chapter 1 to find out about choosing and finding packing materi-
als.) They also purchase delivery confirmations when using the Postal Service.
Savvy self-insurers usually do not self-insure items of high value. If you sell
mostly lower-priced items (under $100) and decide to self-insure, consider
making an exception when you do occasionally sell an expensive item. Bite
the bullet and pay for the shipping insurance; doing so could save you
money and hassle in the long run.
How do you afford to self-insure? Here are a couple of common methods:
✦Tack an additional $1.00 onto every item’s postage amount as part of
your handling fee. The more items you sell and ship, the more that little
dollar-per-item profit builds up and gives you a fund that you can use to
cover the rare instance of a damaged or missing item.
✦Offer optional insurance at full USPS prices as part of the sale. Then,
rather than pay the post office to insure the items, keep the extra fee.
Again, if something untoward happens to one of your packages as it gets
(or doesn’t get) to its destination, you’ll have accumulated a small fund
to cover any refund to the buyer.
This second method of building your self-insurance fund may be a risky
proposition — especially if you get hit with two expensive lost items in a
row! But if you sell a lot of items for under $100, you might find that this
works for you.
Insuring through the major carriers
All the major shippers are in the shipping business (duh), not in the insur-
ance business. Insuring is an annoying — but necessary — sideline to their
package transit businesses.
Most carriers, other than the United States Postal Service, cover all ship-
ments automatically (and at no extra charge) for the first $100 of package
value. By the way, the package value of an item sold on eBay is the final bid
(or Buy It Now) amount. Of course, you can always buy additional package
insurance for your shipped items. Should a package get lost or damaged,
making a claim opens an entirely new can of worms.

Getting private shipping insurance
If you think that printing your own postage is slick, you’re gonna love
Universal Parcel Insurance Coverage (U-PIC), a service that automates the
post office insurance hassle because you can handle your insurance elec-
tronically. You can insure packages that you send through USPS, UPS, FedEx,
and other major carriers. If you use its insurance on USPS-shipped packages,
you can save as much as 80% on insurance rates.
U-PIC caters to individual eBay sellers amidst its many big business clients.
Here are some great features of the U-PIC service:
✦No time wasted standing in line at the post office: The U-PIC service is
integrated into online postage solutions such as endicia.com (described
in Chapter 1).
✦Quick payments on claims: If you have a claim, U-PIC pays it within
7 days of receiving all required documents from the carrier.
As with any insurance policy, assume that if you have many claims against
your packages, you can be dropped from the service. (This thought only
gives me more impetus to package my items properly — I never want to
be banished to the counter lines again!)
✦Blanket approval: U-PIC is approved by all major carriers. And turnabout
is fair play: All carriers covered must be on the U-PIC approved carrier
listing.
✦Savings: Again, depending on the quantity and type of items you ship,
using U-PIC may save you between 65 and 90% on your insurance costs.
Table 3-2 shows the company’s current rates. International coverage is
available for all carriers listed in the table, as well as for approved air
carriers.

Visit the U-PIC Web site (see Figure 3-1) and poke around. However, to get
the best information, give them a phone call at their toll-free number. Your 
U-PIC sales representative will explain to you exactly how to declare value
based on your present system. At the end of each shipping month, you fax,
e-mail, or snail mail your shipping reports to U-PIC.
To apply for your own U-PIC policy — with no charge to apply and no mini-
mum premium — go directly to the application on their Web site at

To apply for the U-PIC service, you must fill out a Request to Provide (RTP)
form. You must answer questions about who you are, how many packages
you send, how many insurance claims you’ve filed in the past two years, and
your average value per package.
After you fill out the online form and agree to the policy (Evidence of
Insurance), a U-PIC representative will contact you within 48 hours. The rep-
resentative will answer your questions and help you decide which of their
programs will work best for your eBay business:
✦The occasional shipper program is for the person who ships one to
five packages per month. You can pay for your insurance online using a
credit card, but the rates are not as attractive as those for the standard
program.
✦The offline standard program is the service for eBay businesspeople
who ship a large amount of packages per month. At the end of each 
shipping month, you generate an insurance report and use it to cal-
culate your premium. You can pay the premium by check or through
PayPal.
To place a claim with U-PIC on a USPS shipment, you must do so no sooner
than 21 days on a lost shipment and no later than 90 days after the date of
mailing. You must supply the following:
✦A signed letter, stating the loss or damage from the consignee
✦A copy of the monthly insurance report you turned in to U-PIC reflecting
the insured value
✦A completed U-PIC claim form (one claim form per claim)
✦A copy of the original invoice or the end-of-auction form
Because you’re paying for private insurance, U-PIC suggests that you include
in the package a copy of your insurance policy (or at the very least a note
explaining that you have an insurance policy covering your shipments) so
that your buyer doesn’t think you’re overcharging (which makes some folks
a bit cranky).
U-PIC will also insure international shipments. The cost to insure interna-
tional USPS parcels is only $1.00 per $100.00, with no deductible.
If you’re a high-volume shipper, you can negotiate an even lower rate with 
U-PIC. To reach U-PIC, call them toll-free at 800-955-4623.

Avoiding Mistyped Addresses
633
Avoiding Mistyped Addresses
Lost packages are the bane of all carriers. The post office has been dealing
with this problem since they opened the Dead Letter Office in 1825.
The Postal Service’s Dead Letter Office employees (I’ll call them DLOs) are
the only people legally permitted to open lost mail. When an address label
gets smooshed, torn, wet, or otherwise illegible and the box can’t be deliv-
ered, it finds its way into the hands of the DLOs, who open the package with
the hope of finding enough information to get it to the rightful owner.
Make sure that you always include a packing slip — like the kind you print from
Selling Manager or My eBay — inside your packages. The packing slip should
have both your address and the buyer’s address so that if the label is illegible,
the packing slip will identify the owner and the package can be delivered.
Of course, having the buyer’s address correct on the label is critical to begin
with. The following ideas and practices will help you create accurate shipping
labels:
✦Cut and paste the buyer’s address: The safest way to correct addressing
is to cut and paste the buyer’s address information from an e-mail or the
PayPal payment confirmation or download. If your buyer’s address shows
as unconfirmed through PayPal, send a quick e-mail to your buyer to
verify. People do make mistakes, even when writing their own addresses.
✦Don’t depend on the carrier to correct an address: No carrier is going
to tell you whether the address you have is incorrect. The only time I’ve
had inaccurate addresses corrected is when I used the DAZzle software.
✦Use software or online services to check your buyer’s address: It’s good
business practice to confirm the viability of an address before you send
your item. Software such as DAZzle (from endicia.com, which I discuss in
Chapter 1) corrects most common addressing errors such as misspelled
city or street names. If you have a question about a zip code, you can
check it at the post office Web site at www.usps.com/zip4. See how it
corrected the city (and questions the address) in Figure 3-2?
If you have the Google toolbar (which I highly recommend in Book VIII), or
go to www.google.com, you can type any UPS, post office, or FedEx tracking
number and find the current tracking information from the carrier’s Web
site. Just copy and paste the tracking number into the Google search box
and start your search. You’ll come to a page that presents a link to track
packages — with your number and carrier showing. Click the link and you
end up at the carrier’s site with all the current tracking information! Nice!

There was also a dress that I sold and shipped Priority Mail. It never arrived.
I had a boiling-hot buyer on the other end, but luckily, I had proof of mailing
in the form of a delivery confirmation to show her. I nagged the post office
about the package, but as you’ll read in the section, “Filing a claim with the
post office,” you have to wait 30 days for a package to be officially declared
lost. On the 29th day, the box was returned to me with no explanation or fan-
fare and just a return-to-sender stamp on the front.

A couple of claim stories
Several years ago, I purchased an original
wardrobe uniform tunic from the Star Trek series
that was framed and autographed by Leonard
Nimoy. When it came, in an appropriate large
box surrounded with lots of Styrofoam peanuts
and bubble wrap, it also sported a 4” x 4” hole
in the side, and it looked like someone had taken
a sword to the box! Not only that, but there was
a sad sound of glass tinkling when I shook the
box. Oh, yes, the delivery man had dumped the
box, rang the bell, and ran.
The carrier couldn’t argue about the damage.
The claim department tried to give me the line
that the item was packed incorrectly. (Does that
mean it was sent with a big hole already in the
side of the box?) Then they offered me a partial
payment. Gee, I really wanted the glass-particle-
infested, ripped tunic now. It took a while, but
the damages were so obvious that the carrier
had to give in and agreed to send a check to the
seller. Upon hearing this decision, the seller
refunded my payment. (I wonder how long the
seller had to wait for his payment?)

Making a Claim When Shipping Goes Bad
635
Making a Claim When Shipping Goes Bad
If you’ve been selling or buying on eBay for awhile, odds are you’ve made a
claim for lost or damaged packages. The process is often grueling — with all
the paperwork that’s involved — and the decision of the carrier is final. If
you don’t agree with the carrier, you could try small claims court. But realize
that you’ll lose a day of work and, in court, you’ll face all the legalese you
find in the teeny-tiny print on the carrier’s terms of service.
I understand the hassles because I’ve had to make several claims myself. I’d
like to help you avoid similar unpleasant experiences, or at least make them
less unpleasant. I present information about the U.S. Postal Service first
because their claim process is more stringent than that of the other carriers.
With any carrier, however, you need to gather the same type of backup infor-
mation before making a claim.
Filing a claim with the post office
Making a claim with the post office: Oh man, talk about a hassle. But making
a claim with any carrier isn’t a bowl of cherries on any day! Before making a
claim with the USPS, check to make sure your package was covered by postal
insurance, purchased at the time of mailing. If you use private insurance
instead, you make a claim with your insurance carrier, not the post office.
When a package is lost in transit, you must wait a minimum of 30 days after
the mailing date before you make the claim. If an item arrives at the buyer’s
door damaged, you may make a claim with the post office immediately.
There’s always a question as to who makes the claim:
✦Damaged or lost contents: Either the seller or the buyer can file the
claim.
✦Complete loss: When a package has not turned up within 30 days, the
seller files the claim.
First, you must get a copy of PS Form 1000, Domestic Claim or Registered Mail
Inquiry. Go to the post office or download it at
http://www.usps.com/forms/_pdf/ps1000.pdf
Fill out the form with all the details required and bring your backup 
information.

Making a Claim When Shipping Goes Bad
636
To make a damage claim, you must produce evidence of insurance. This can
be either of the following documents:
✦Original mailing receipt: The receipt that was stamped at the post
office counter when the item was mailed.
✦Original box or wrapper: This must show the addresses of both the
sender and the recipient along with whatever tags or stamps the post
office put on the package to say it’s insured.
If only the box or wrapper is presented as proof of insurance, the post office
will likely limit the claim to $100.
You must also produce evidence showing the value of the item when it was
mailed. The following list shows some of the documents accepted by the post
office for damage claims (however, they may ask for more thorough proof):
✦Sales receipt or descriptive invoice
✦Copy of your canceled check or money order receipt
✦Picture and description of a similar item from a catalog if your receipt
isn’t available
✦A letter from the seller stating the value of the item
✦Your own description of the item, including date and time the item was
purchased and whether it is new or vintage
For missing packages, you (the seller) need a letter from the buyer (dated
30 days after the package was mailed) stating that the buyer never received
the package.
If your buyer is too cranky to cooperate, go to the post office where you
mailed the package. Ask for a written statement that there is no record of the
delivery being made. Postal employees can look up the insurance or delivery
confirmation numbers to find whether the delivery took place, but the post
office will charge you $6.60 for their efforts. That amount will be reimbursed
if the post office pays your claim and doesn’t locate your package under a
bale of hay in Indiana.
If all goes well and your claim is deemed legit, you should get your payment
within 30 days. If you don’t hear from the post office within 45 days (maybe
the payment got lost in the mail?), you have to submit a duplicate claim using
the original claim number.

Book VII
Chapter 3
Insuring Your 
Item’s Delivery
Making a Claim When Shipping Goes Bad
637
Note to self (and to you): Always make a copy of any form you give to the
government.
Filing a claim with UPS
Whoa! The stories of filing claims with UPS are legendary. Almost any eBay
seller can tell you quite a story. I must admit that making a claim with UPS
is a good deal easier than making a claim with the post office. After they file
and accept your damage claim, you get a check within five days.
For damaged packages, UPS recently streamlined the process, although the
buyer must make the claim. You can (if you really want to) call 1-800-PICK-UPS
(cute, eh?) to file your claim. The better idea is to go directly to the online
reporting instructions at
www.ups.com/content/us/en/resources/service/tracking/claims.
html
Be sure you make your report to UPS within 48 hours of delivery.
On the online claim form, you’ll be asked to input all information about the
package and the damage. UPS seems to be familiar with its own handiwork
because you get to select your particular type of damage from a menu.
After you’ve filled out and submitted the form, just sit on your haunches and
wait for the UPS claims department to contact you.
Buying lost packages
When the post office pays your claim, it will
usually ask to keep your item. Your item and
thousands of others will end up at one of the
Mail Recovery Centers across the country.
Here it joins the other lost and salvage mail to
be sold, usually at auction. The post office used
to run these auctions on eBay under the user
ID usps-mrc-everythingelse. I used to
buy some great case lots from them and turn
around and resell them on eBay!
Now the post office sells the stuff at live auc-
tions. If you’d like to attend one, check their
Web site at www.usps.com/auctions for
dates and times. The post office always has
good stuff for sale and usually in good quantity.
If you’re interested in buying post office surplus
(such as an old truck or supplies), check out
eBay sellers usps-ne-springfield and
usps-al-pmsc.

Making a Claim When Shipping Goes Bad
638
I recommend that you print your form after filling it out so you can keep all
claim reference information in one place.
After the buyer makes the claim, UPS sends a Damage/Loss Notification
Letter form to the seller. The seller must fill out the form to state the item’s
value and attach supporting documentation. The form can then be faxed
back to UPS for final verification.
Save the damaged item and all the packaging that it came in. UPS may send
an inspector out to look at the package before they approve a claim.
If a UPS shipment appears to be lost, the seller must call UPS to request a
package tracer. If UPS is unable to prove delivery, the claim is paid.
Filing a claim with FedEx
Filing a claim with FedEx is similar to the UPS procedure, except FedEx gives
you a little more leeway as to time. Instead of the 48-hours-after-delivery dead-
line, you have 15 business days to make your claim. (This extra time sure
helps out when a package is delivered to your house and you’re out of town.)
FedEx processes all Concealed Loss and Damage claims within five to seven
days after receiving all the paperwork and information.
As with UPS, keep all packaging, along with the item, in case FedEx wants to
come and inspect the damage.
You can make your FedEx claim in a couple of ways:
✦By fax: You can download a PDF claim form with instructions at
www.fedex.com/us/customer/claims/Claims.pdf
Fill out the form and fax it to the number on the form.
✦Online: Fill out the online claim form on a secure server at
https://www.fedex.com/us/claimsonline
You must have a FedEx login to begin your claim. (See Chapter 2 on how
to get this.) You still have to mail or fax your supporting documentation.
When you file online, you can also choose to receive e-mail updates from
FedEx regarding your claim (good idea).
The claim payment will be sent to the seller, so it’s up to the seller to make
restitution with the buyer. As the seller, you should refund the money as
soon as the claim is approved.

O
nce the selling bug has bitten you, it’s a natural transition to go from
listing a few items a month to 50 or more. And that, dear reader, means
you are officially running an eBay business. Congratulations!
There’s a good and a bad side to this. The good is that you’re making con-
siderably more cash than you did before hooking up with eBay. The bad?
It’s time to start investing in some tools to keep your business professional.
The first tool that can help smooth your transition makes the process of
running eBay auctions and sales consistent — Selling Manager.
Book III gets into eBay’s free Turbo Lister program (it gets your items on the
site without having to go through the slow, sometimes-torturous Sell Your
Item form). As with Turbo Lister, Selling Manager is a suite of tools for man-
aging your selling business from any computer (as long as it has an Internet
connection). eBay gives you 30 days to try out the service for free, thereafter
charging you $4.99 per month. Believe me, the time that Selling Manager will
save you is well worth the fee.
I’ve run well over 60 auctions at a time, successfully managing them with
Selling Manager. I use it along with PayPal’s tools and QuickBooks (see Book IX
for more about this method). This approach provides a professional solution
for my medium-size eBay business.

If you plan to exceed 75 transactions at a time, consider using Selling Manager
Pro; it has bulk feedback and bulk invoice-printing features. You can also go
off eBay to a third-party solution.
Selling Manager Features
A versatile program, Selling Manager allows you to monitor or automate
many of the more tedious eBay tasks. The Summary page has four major
headings, and the My eBay Views section on the left has six main headings.
Scheduled listings
The Scheduled Listings link on the Summary page takes you to any auction,
fixed-price, or store listing you’ve sent to eBay through Turbo Lister (or listed
on the Sell Your Item page) and scheduled for a later starting date or time.
You can also view these pending (scheduled) listings through links that narrow
them to listings starting within the next hour or listings starting today.
When you enter the Scheduled Listings area (by clicking the Scheduled
Listings link), you can go directly to any of your listings. (One of my pending
listings is shown in Figure 1-2.) If you want to promote your listing-to-be in a
banner ad (or create a link to it from elsewhere on the Internet), you can do
so using the URL of the pending listing. See Book VI for more information on
promoting your eBay business.
From the Scheduled Listings page, you can confirm all information about the
sale, as well as make any changes to the listing or to the scheduling time.

Active listings
Click the Active Listings link on the Summary page, and you can observe the
bidding action just as you can from the My eBay Selling page. The color-coding
that indicates bidding activity is the same as on the My eBay Selling page.
(If the current price is in green and bolded, your item has a bid and the
number reflects the high bid. The current price is in red if there are no bids
in an auction.) Your listings are accessible with a click of your mouse.
You have the option to show only auctions, store listings, or fixed-price
items on the Active Listings page. You can also search your own listings
by keyword or item number.
For more about active listings, visit the Summary page, which includes links
to items ending within the hour and within the next 24 hours.
Sold listings
The Sold Listings feature (which you get to by clicking the Sold Listings link on
the Summary page), is where Selling Manager really shines. You’ll find quite
a few links here, including these:
✦Awaiting payment: This is where items that have been won or bought
are listed before a payment is made.
✦Paid and ready to ship: If you input the fact that a buyer has sent pay-
ment, or if the buyer pays through PayPal, the transaction automatically
moves to this category.
✦Paid and ready for feedback: After an item is paid for, a reference to it
appears here so you can keep track of the feedback you need to leave.
✦Paid and shipped: These are (you guessed it) items that the buyer has
paid for and that you’ve indicated on the transaction record as shipped.
Sold listings past due
I hate to see items in the Sold Listings Past Due area of the Summary page,
because it means there’s a good chance I’m not going to get paid for an item.
I always keep an eye on my Sold, Awaiting Payment items and send out a
payment reminder when three days has passed. If seven days pass without
payment, the item drops into Sold Listings Past Due: Unpaid and becomes
eligible for an unpaid item reminder.
✦Unpaid and eligible for unpaid item reminder: This is where the items
awaiting payment fall when they become eligible for you to file a non-
paying bidder alert. This happens when 7 days have passed without a
payment being received.

✦Unpaid item disputes awaiting your response: After you’ve filed an
unpaid item reminder, the item goes into this area. It links to a dispute
page that lists all outstanding disputes. The buyer has the right to answer
your dispute here and you can answer it.
✦Unpaid and eligible for final value fee credit: This is the sad category
where buyers from the Non-Paying Bidder column go if, after all your
attempts to get action, they haven’t responded and haven’t sent pay-
ment. (If they don’t cough up within 10 days after you file a Non-Paying
Bidder Alert, the listing moves to this category automatically.)
My eBay Views links
On the left side of the My eBay page, you see more links for Selling Manager:
Unsold items (for relisting), Archived items, and eBay’s Picture Manager photo-
hosting solution. From the Archived link, you can access completed items that
closed within the last four months. You can also download this information
to your computer. There are good records here, so you should download and
keep them. For more on what you can do with these records, see Book IX.
Seller tools links
Scroll down the page and you’ll see the Seller Tools box on the left side of
the Summary page. Its a powerful group of links that allow you to download
and export your sales history to your computer. You also have quick links
to PayPal, Picture Manager, Accounting Assistant (see Book IX for more on
Accounting Assistant), My eBay Store, and the good old My eBay Selling
page — in case you get nostalgic for the old, pre-Selling Manager days.
Cross-promotions for store owners
If you have an eBay store, you’ll see a Cross Promotions area on the right
side of the Summary page. This is where you can set up your merchandising
box that shows selected items you have for sale on each item page when it’s
viewed by the prospective buyer. Figure 1-3 shows you the cross-promotions
box on an active item page.
eBay uses three icons to communicate the status of your cross-promotions:
✦Two small boxes with an arrow: One of the manually selected cross-
promotion items has ended and has been automatically replaced within
the parameters of your default settings.
✦Blue checkmark: Items you’ve selected individually for cross-promotions
that are still active on the page. (In other words, your cross-promotions
haven’t expired, causing the system to substitute another for you.)
✦Blue checkmark with a circle: Cross-promotions have been automati-
cally selected for you by eBay based on your preferences.

Auto-Sending Invoices
646
When using Selling Manager, you’ll have an alert (informational) area on
your Summary page as shown in Figure 1-4.
To edit your cross-promotions from the My eBay page, follow these steps:
1. Click the link to view the status of all your cross-promotions.
2. Click the drop-down list box in the Actions column next to the item to
edit your promotions.
Click the Edit Promotions link and you’re taken to a page where you can
change your cross-promotions.
Auto-Sending Invoices
One of my favorite features of Selling Manager is that I can follow the progress
of my sales from the Summary page. When an item has been won or paid for
using PayPal, I can click the appropriate link to see the list of items ready for
an action (like shipping!). Figure 1-5 shows my Sold Listings: Paid and Waiting
to Ship area in Selling Manager.

Notice the record number next to the winner’s e-mail address. To send an

The sales record for that transaction appears. You see the items sold to
that buyer, as shown in Figure 1-6. If the buyer has made more than one
purchase, you’ll see a notation stating as such. You then have the option
to click the link to combine purchases in the sales record.
2. Click the E-Mail Buyer button.
3. Select the appropriate e-mail template to send.
If you want, you can personalize the e-mail by altering one of the templates
that Selling Manager supplies. (See the “Selling Manager’s customizable
e-mail templates” sidebar.)
4. When you’re ready to send the e-mail, click Send.

Tracking Payments
Selling Manager makes many selling processes considerably easier. Take a
look your Selling Manager Summary page. From here, you can see how many
buyers have paid for their purchases — and, sadly, how many haven’t.
If you’re expecting payments, be sure to check the Summary page several
times a day. When a buyer makes his or her payment using PayPal, eBay will
Selling Manager’s customizable e-mail templates
Selling Manager has seven e-mail templates
that you can quickly and easily customize. These
templates allow you to add auto text, informa-
tion that eBay’s server fills in for that particular
transaction. Note in the figure the drop-down
list, which provides shortcuts to edit the eBay-
supplied templates. When a winner buys an
item, I have a preformatted winning buyer noti-
fication letter I created from one of these tem-
plates. When a winner pays immediately using
PayPal, I also have a payment-received e-mail.

update your records. (PayPal also sends you a payment received e-mail, but
this type of notification is often late.)
After you ship the item, you can indicate that on the Sales Status & Memo
screen, shown in Figure 1-7. The transaction information in Figure 1-7 is 
available when you click the record number next to the item that has been
shipped. If you ship the item, input that info, and click Save, the record will
move from the Sold Listings, Paid and Ready to Ship page to the Paid and
Shipped page. This change will also be reflected on the Summary page.
Relisting
Wouldn’t it be better if you could select a whole bunch of items and relist
them all together? Step up to Selling Manager for a one-click option.
You can access items that have not sold, logically enough, from the Unsold
Items area (as shown in Figure 1-8). Relisting is accomplished with a click of
the mouse!
I need to stress the difference between Relisting and Sell Similar. You need to
relist an item that hasn’t sold, so that you will be able to get a refund on your
listing fees if it sells the second time. (This doesn’t work on the third try.)
When an item has been sold, you use the Sell Similar link to start the listing
in a new cycle in eBay’s master computers. That way, if it doesn’t sell, you’ll
be able to relist and take advantage of the possible refund.
Figure 1-7:

Relisting
650
To relist an item (or Sell Similar) through Selling Manager, follow these 
steps:
1. Go to the Sold or Unsold listings.
To do so, click the links in the Selling Manager box on the left of the page
(or just link through the summary).
2. Select the items to relist (or Sell Similar) by selecting the check box
next to each item’s record number.
You may select any or all of the items listed on the page.
3. Click the Relist button (or the Sell Similar button).
The Relist Multiple Items page appears.
4. Review all the items listed (along with the fees).
5. Submit the items by clicking the Submit Listing button.
Figure 1-9 shows a portion of the Relist Multiple Items page that includes a
complete review of the details of each item. If you proceed at this point, the
items will be relisted exactly as you had them listed before. At the bottom of
the list, eBay recaps all relisting fees.

Selling Manager Reports
I like Selling Manager because it gives you the opportunity to keep all your
selling information in one place. It also provides a downloadable report in a
spreadsheet format that you can archive for your business records. Here is
the information you can expect to find in the report:
✦Sales record number: The number assigned to the transaction by
Selling Manager for identification purposes.
✦User ID: The eBay user ID of the person who purchased the item from you.
✦Buyer zip: The buyer’s zip code.
✦State: The state the buyer resides in.
✦Buyer country: The country your buyer lives in.
✦Item number: The eBay number assigned to the item when you listed it
for sale on the site.
✦Item title: The title of the listing as it appeared on eBay.
✦Quantity: The number of items purchased in the transaction.
✦Sale price: The final selling price of the item.
Figure 1-9:
Relist
several
items at

Selling Manager Reports
652
✦Shipping amount: The amount you charged for shipping the item.
✦Shipping insurance: If the buyer paid insurance, it is listed next to their
sales record.
✦State sales tax: If you’ve set up Selling Manager to calculate sales tax for
your in-state sales, and sales tax was applied to the item when it was sold,
that amount is listed here.
✦Total price: The GSA (gross sales amount) for the transaction.
✦Payment method: The method of payment used by the buyer. This is
inserted automatically if the item is paid through PayPal, or manually
inserted by you into the sales record if paid by another method.
✦Sale date: The date the transaction occurred on eBay.
✦Checkout: The date of checkout. This is usually the same as the transac-
tion date.
✦Paid on date: The date the buyer paid for the item.
✦Shipped on date: The ship date you entered in Selling Manager.
✦Feedback left: Whether you left feedback for the buyer is indicated by a
Yes or No in this column.
✦Feedback received: The feedback rating left for you by the buyer 
(positive, negative, or neutral).
✦Notes to yourself: If you input any personal notes regarding the transac-
tion in the sales record, they appear here.
Keep in mind that Selling Manager reports are available on the site for only
four months, so be sure to download your information regularly.
Notice that there is no column reflecting the eBay fees you paid for listing
and selling the item. If you have plenty of time on your hands, you can create
another column and input the fees from your eBay invoice for each item. Save
time by posting the monthly total once a month in your bookkeeping program.
To get the file from eBay to your computer, follow these steps:
1. From your My eBay page, click the Selling Manager link.
The opening page of Selling Manager is your Summary page.
2. Under Seller Tools, click the Download Sales History link.
A Download Sales History page appears, as shown in Figure 1-10.
3. Select the time period you want to include in your report.
It’s best to generate monthly or quarterly reports, so that your reports
coincide with specific tax periods. You can always combine more than one
report in your spreadsheet program to show different periods of time.

6. Rename the file to reflect the sales month and year, and then click Save.
After the file is downloaded, you’ll see a confirmation with your new 
filename.
It’s a good idea to create a directory on your computer with a name such as
eBay Sales. In this directory, you can store all the reports you download from
eBay, PayPal, or any other online service. Be sure to include this directory
when you perform regular data backups.
Now you can open the new file in Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Works. It will
look similar to Figure 1-12.
With simple spreadsheet commands, you can customize the look of your
report. For example, if the column for Buyer Country is unnecessary for your
records (you ship only within the United States, so the information is not
useful), you can delete the column.
To delete a column:
1. Highlight the column by clicking the column letter.
2. Choose Edit➪Delete.
Voilá! The offending column is no more.

All spreadsheet tasks mentioned here can be performed in similar fashion in
Microsoft Works or Excel.
The spreadsheet generated by Selling Manger is much more useful if you total
the columns. That way, you can see your total sales at a glance. To total a
spreadsheet column:
1. Click in the blank box at the bottom of the column you want to total.
2. Click the AutoSum button.
3. Click and drag over the cells you want to sum.
4. Press Enter, and the total appears.
If you want to total the columns next to the one you just totaled, you don’t
have to re-input the formula. Just highlight the results cell from your last 
formula, and highlight cells in the same row that you want to contain totals
of the columns. Then choose Edit➪Fill➪Right, as shown in Figure 1-13. This
copies the formula to the connecting cells and all the columns are totaled.

Management Tools
In This Chapter
 Deciding among the available tools
 Checking out auction management services
 Figuring out what tasks you can automate
W
hen you get to the point of running up to 20 auctions at a time, I
highly recommend that you begin to use a management tool. At this
level of activity, using eBay’s Selling Manager will suit you nicely, and I go
over how Selling Manager works in Chapter 1. But when your eBay business
begins to push 100 listings a week, I recommend that you get additional help
in the form of an auction management service or software.
Whether you use an online service or software residing on your own com-
puter is a personal decision. You may find it easier to use an online system
because you can log on to your selling information at any time from any
computer. But if you have a slow Internet connection or pay usage fees by
the hour, managing your eBay business online can become impractical.
Most desktop-based software packages have features that enable you to do
your work on your computer and then upload (or download) your data
when you go online. If having multiple locations to work from is not impor-
tant and you run your eBay business from a single computer in your office,
you may feel more comfortable with a desktop-based software product.
In either case, if your business has reached the level where you need an auc-
tion management tool, congratulations! In this chapter, I want to save you
some time finding the service or software that’s right for you. I outline some
of the tasks that an auction management product should provide, and com-
pare prices of several services.

Choosing Your Auction Management Tools
658
Choosing Your Auction Management Tools
If you searched the Internet for auction management services and software,
you’d come up with a bunch. For simplicity’s sake, I’ve chosen to examine
just a few of these services in this chapter. After speaking to many sellers,
I’ve found online services that offer two important features:
✦Uptime reliability (uptime is key here; you don’t want the server that
holds your photos going down or mislaunching your auctions)
✦Software that’s continually updated to match changes to eBay
Using a site or software to run your auctions takes practice, so I suggest that
you try any that appeal to you and offer free preview trials. As I describe
these different applications, I include a link so that you can check them out
further.
Some software and services work on a monthly fee; others work on a one-time
purchase fee. For a one-time-purchase software application to truly benefit
you, it must have the reputation for updating its software each time eBay
makes a change in its system. The programs that I discuss in this chapter
have been upgraded continually to date.
Most services have a free trial period. Be sure that you don’t spend a bunch
of your precious time inputting your entire inventory, only to discover you
don’t like the way the service works. Instead, input a few items to give the
service a whirl.
There’s a huge difference between auction listing software and sites and auc-
tion management products. For many a seller, listing software like eBay’s
Turbo Lister (see Book III, Chapter 4) may just do the trick. Combine that
with eBay’s Selling Manager (a management program) and your eBay busi-
ness will be humming along just fine.
When your business activity level increases and you turn to an auction man-
agement solution for your eBay business, you should look for certain standard
features (described next). Also consider what information management fea-
tures you currently have through your bookkeeping program (see Book IX).
You have the data there, regardless of whether you use it in a management
solution.
Many of the products listed have several pricing tiers, so Table 2-1 provides
the link to the product’s pricing page. I’ve also listed the minimum price for
each company’s management products. Some offer less expensive options
for listing your auctions (with templates and all kinds of swell bells and 
whistles), but the price shown in the table is for the minimum management
product.

Never choose auction management tools based solely on price. Go to the
various Web sites and take a look at everything they offer for the price
stated. You may find out that a service charging a bit more may just be
worth it because of all the extra tools offered.
Looking for essential features
Here are some of the must-have features to look for when you evaluate the
offerings of auction management services and products:
✦Image hosting: Some Web sites dazzle you with high-megabyte storage
numbers. Keep one thing in mind. If your average eBay image is around
40K, you could store 128 pictures in a 5MB storage space and about
2500 images in a 100MB storage space. Unless you’re a big-time seller,
you really don’t need that much space. Your eBay images should be
archived on your computer (how about in a folder called eBay Images).
Images for current listings should be on the hosted site only while the
transaction is in progress. After the buyer has the item and all is well,
you can remove the images from the remote server.
You most likely already have free image hosting on your ISP’s Web site,
as noted in Book V.

Choosing Your Auction Management Tools
660
✦Designing listings: The basis of most of these products is a good listing
function. You’ll be able to select from supplied templates or design your
own and store them for future use. An important feature now coming into
use is a spell checker. There’s nothing worse than a misspelling in a listing!
✦Uploading listings: Most products have a feature that launches a group
of listings to eBay all at once. They may also allow you to schedule auc-
tions to get underway at a prescribed time.
You can also expect to be able to put together your listings at your
leisure offline and upload them to your service. Most products archive
your past listings so that you can relist at any time. Many services also
offer bulk relisting.
✦E-mail management: You can expect to be provided with sample e-mail
letters (templates) that you can customize with your own look and feel.
The services should also offer auto-generated end-of-auction, payment
received, and shipping e-mail services.
✦Feedback automation: Post feedback in bulk to a number of your com-
pleted listings, or leave predesigned feedback one by one. Some products
support automatic feedback when a buyer leaves you positive feedback.
✦Sales reports: Some services (even the least expensive) offer you some
sort of sales analysis. Be sure to take into account how much you really
need this feature, based on data that you may already receive from
QuickBooks, PayPal, eBay Stores, or SquareTrade.
Exploring advanced features
Depending upon the type of business you run, you may need some of the
more advanced features offered by management products:
✦Inventory tools: Management products may allow you to create inven-
tory records for your different products, permitting you to click a bunch
to list automatically. When an item is sold, it will deduct the items from
your inventory.
✦Sales-tax tracking and invoicing: With full management, you can expect
your sales tax to be calculated into your invoices and complete line-item
invoices to be sent automatically. Multiple items, when purchased by
the same buyer, will be combined.
✦Consignment tracking: If you’re a Trading Assistant, be sure to look for
a product that enables you to separately track the products you sell for
different clients. You should also be able to produce reports of consign-
ment sales by customer.
✦Shipping: Most of the services will give you the option of printing your
packing lists and shipping labels directly from the product. Some of the
larger services integrate with the major shippers, allowing you to go
directly to the particular shipper’s site and ship from their software.

Online or Offline Management?
You may want to run your business from any computer, anywhere in the
world. If that’s the case, you might do best with an online service. But if you
want to run your business from a fixed location, you might feel more com-
fortable with downloadable software that will handle most of the chores on
your own computer.
Online auction management sites
Auction management Web sites handle almost everything, from inventory
management to label printing. Some sellers prefer online (or hosted) man-
agement sites because you can access your information from any computer.
You might use every feature a site offers, or you might choose a bit from
column A and a bit from column B and perform the more personalized tasks
manually. Read on to determine what service might best suit your needs.

Online or Offline Management?

Although quite a few excellent online services for automating sales are avail-
able, I have room here to show you only a few. Many services are similar in
format, so in the following sections I point out some of the highlights of a few
representative systems. Remember that by using an online service, your
information resides on a server out there in cyberspace; if you’re a control
freak, it may be a bit much to bear.
When selecting a service, look for a logo or text indicating that the service is
an eBay Certified Developer, Preferred Solution Provider, or API licensee. These
people have first access to eBay’s system changes and can implement them
immediately. Others may have a day or so lag time to update their software.
ChannelAdvisor
ChannelAdvisor’s founder Scot Wingo got into the auction business around
the turn of the century. His first foray into the eBay world was AuctionRover,
a site that had tools to perform an extensive eBay search, list auctions, and
check pricing trends. The company’s cute Rover logo was fashioned after
Wingo’s Border Collie, Mack.
Fast forward to today. ChannelAdvisor is a highly popular management serv-
ice for all levels of eBay sellers. They supply listing and management services
to everyone from Fortune 1000 companies to the little old lady next door.
How? They offer three levels of software: Enterprise for large businesses who
want to outsource their online business, Merchant for midsized businesses
and higher-level PowerSellers, and Pro for small businesses and individuals.
These powerful software suites help eBay sellers successfully manage and
automate the sale of their merchandise.
Starting at the entry level, you can get the Pro version of ChannelAdvisor for
$29.95 a month. Here’s what they offer the beginning-level seller:
✦Listing design and launching: Create your listings with their standard
templates or use your own HTML to design auction descriptions. List
your items immediately or schedule a listing. ChannelAdvisor will launch
the auction when you tell them to.
✦Item and inventory management: If you want to keep your inventory
online, you can create it on their system. If you want to input your inven-
tory offline, you can import it from their Excel template. You can also
import open auctions or store listings to your ChannelAdvisor account
for relisting or servicing.
✦Image hosting: You get 250MB of space to host your images. You can
upload images to the site four at a time, or use FTP to upload a large
quantity.
✦Post-auction management: This function merges your winning auction
information and generates customized e-mail and invoices to your buyers.
You can print mailing labels too.

MarketWorks (previously AuctionWorks)
A group of collectors who saw the need for power tools for PowerSellers
developed this highly graphical site (www.MarketWorks.com). I think they’ve
succeeded. (They were known in the eBay community as AuctionWorks, but
changed their name in June 2004.) A high percentage of eBay PowerSellers
use the site. They launch approximately 2 million listings on eBay every
month. MarketWorks offers help links at every turn, a first-rate online tuto-
rial, free toll-free support (that’s a free phone call and free support), and
free interactive training classes for registered users. Here are just a few 
features:
✦Item and inventory management: Features the ClickLaunch Single
Step Launcher, which launches individual items to auction while adding
them to inventory. (The site also has a bulk item-launching capability.)
LaunchBots provides automated launching of your listings. You can
import existing auctions from eBay and import them with their bulk
inventory upload form in Excel and MS Access.
✦Image hosting: Enables you to bulk upload 15 images at a time to their
servers. The basic account allows 100MB of storage. If your images aver-
age 30K each, you should be able to upload almost 3500 images into the
100MB image hosting space.
✦Auction reporting: Generates accounts receivable, item history, and
post-sales reports from the Reports area. MarketWorks has its own
system for sales and item tracking. Reports include customizable views
of your sales data, item and auction data, accounts receivable, and sales
tax by state!
✦Templates and listing: MarketWorks uses their own trademarked Ballista
template listing system. You can use their predefined color templates or
use their macros with your own predefined HTML template, substituting
the macros for stock areas in your template. By using their custom ad
template option and well-thought-out macros, you can take your own
HTML and make a MarketWorks template.
✦Post-auction management: Sends out automated e-mail to your winners,
linking them to your own branded checkout page. If customers want to
pay with PayPal or your own merchant account, they have to link from
there. MarketWorks combines multiple wins for shipping and invoicing.

Meridian
Meridian Software was developed by eBay Shooting Star PowerSeller Joe
Cortese. Through his own experience on eBay, he developed this service
to fulfill all the needs of an eBay seller, at a very reasonable price of $9.95 a
month.
As a high-volume eBay seller, he was looking for an easier way to handle his
3000 unique auctions a month. You can apply the same technology to your
auctions. Meridian features enterprise-level listing and more:
✦Item and inventory management: Includes calendar- and time-based
(dates and times for launching) auction scheduling, automated auction
launching and relisting, the ability to import past or current auctions,
and the ability to import auction data from a spreadsheet or database.
✦Image hosting: Offers space for storing pictures. You can upload bulk
images to its Web site or FTP your images directly.
✦Auction reporting: Generates current running auction statistics — the
total number and dollars of current and past auctions — and an itemized
report of each auction.
✦Post-auction management: Allows you to send (manually or automati-
cally) a variety of customized e-mails to winners and nonpaying bidders.
Your invoices can link directly to PayPal.
✦Consignment tools: For sellers who sell for others (see information on
eBay’s Trading Assistants program in Book IV, Chapter 3), Meridian
offers complete tracking and inventory by consignor. 
The post-auction management features also include the ability to send auto-
matic feedback and to create mailing labels for each sale. So that feedback
isn’t posted until you’re sure the transaction is successfully completed, you
have the option of disabling the automatic feedback feature.

Auction management software
Many sellers prefer to run their auction businesses from their own comput-
ers. I happen to like the option of being able to reference my old auctions on
my backups. Luckily, some valuable auction software programs are available
to perform all the tasks you get from the online services. To those who would
rather have the software at home, there are some solid choices other than
the ones I examine in this section. You might also want to visit these other
sites for their quality auction management software.
You can accomplish almost all the same tasks on your own computer as you
can with online services — except online auction checkout. (You can always
use eBay’s checkout as your final stop or include a link in your end-of-auction
e-mail.) If you want, you can always set up a checkout page on your own Web
site that gathers your auction information.
Following is a description of a few of the leading products.
Auction Wizard 2000
Way back in 1999, Standing Wave Software developed a product that would
handle large inventories and meet the needs of the growing eBay popula-
tion. Enter Auction Wizard. In 2000, the company introduced a more robust
version, Auction Wizard 2000, to meet the challenges presented by changes
on eBay.
This software is a tour-de-force of auction management whose pieces are
integrated into one program. Some of its special features enable you to
✦Handle consignment sales. Keep track of consignment sales by con-
signees, including all fees.
✦Edit your images before uploading. The software allows you to import
your images, and crop, rotate, or resize images for your auctions.
✦Upload your pictures with built-in FTP software while you’re working on
your auctions, eliminating the need for another piece of auction business
software.
The program interface is straightforward. I always plunge into new programs
without reading the instructions, and I was able to use the program right off
the bat. I’m still not a whiz at it, but that’s probably because Auction Wizard
2000 has so many features that I haven’t had the time to study them all.

Online or Offline Management?

To begin using the software, simply download your current eBay auctions
directly into the program. When your auctions close, send customized
e-mails (the program fills in the auction information) and manage all your
end-of-auction business. Some sellers launch their auctions using Turbo
Lister, and then retrieve them and handle the end-of-auction management
with Auction Wizard 2000.

Seller’s Assistant Basic and Pro
Of the two versions of Seller’s Assistant, Basic and Pro, the professional 
version is what you’re going to need for your eBay business. Because the
software is owned by eBay, it’s the first to have updates for eBay’s latest
changes.
The setup, as with other management programs, takes a while. With this pro-
gram, you have the option of using eBay Picture Manager for your photos if
your Web site goes down for any reason.
eBay’s Seller’s Assistant Basic is a solid listing program, offering a variety of
templates. Seller’s Assistant automatically inputs your standard shipping
information and auction messages into your auctions so you don’t have to
retype them every time. You can customize your e-mail correspondence:
Seller’s Assistant generates e-mail messages after retrieving your completed
auction information from the site. The program is available for a monthly
subscription fee charged to your regular eBay bill.
The Pro version (which supports multiple user IDs) takes things up a notch,
handling your auction listings as well as automating bulk listing and end-of-
auction business. The Pro version will
✦Spell-check your auction listings
✦Schedule your auction launches for a later posting (see the following tip)
✦Keep track of your inventory
✦Launch items directly from stock at hand
Automating bulk-feedback posting, printing shipping labels, and creating
sales reports are more options you’ll enjoy with Seller’s Assistant Pro.

Pro’s Template studio can be a bit of a challenge until you’re used to it. Seller’s
Assistant Pro comes with a gaggle of various themes. The good thing about
the themes is that you can put your picture anywhere you want in the descrip-
tion. The bad part is that you have no control of the spacing of the lines of
text. Luckily, you can edit the themes to customize a look for your auctions.
One of the finer points of the Pro edition is that you can schedule your auction
listings for a particular time and space out your auctions (within a group of
items to be listed) by a set number of minutes. This is valuable because so
many bidders bid during the last few minutes of the auction.

gram versions, visit

Turbo Lister
I like Turbo Lister because it’s simple and easy to use. It has a built-in 
WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) HTML editor and makes preparing
my listings offline easy. When I’m ready, I just click a button and they’re all
listed at once. You can also stagger listings and schedule them for a later
date for a fee.
For all the details on Turbo Lister, see Book III, Chapter 4.
Finding More to Automate
Now that eBay has become a world marketplace, a single-page auction or
item listing is becoming an increasingly valuable piece of real estate. Millions
view your sale, and the more auctions and fixed-price items that you can list,
the better your chance to make a good living. Time is money: You need to
post your auctions quickly and accurately.
Auction posting, record keeping, inventory cataloging, photo managing, and
statistic gathering are all tasks that you can automate. The more your busi-
ness grows, the more confusing things can become. Automated tools can
help you keep it all straight. But remember that the more paid tools you use,
the more expense you may be adding to your business. Always keep your
bottom line in mind when evaluating whether to use fee-based software and
services.

You’ll have to perform certain office tasks, no matter how few or how many
auctions you’re running. Depending on your personal business style, you
may want to automate any or all of the following tasks. You may choose to
use a single program, a manual method, or some features from one program
and some from others. For those who aren’t ready for the automated plunge,
I offer alternatives. Where appropriate, I insert references guiding you to
where in this book or on the Web you can find more information about the
automated services I discuss.
Setting up an auction photo gallery
Until you get your own eBay store, setting up a photo gallery is a great 
alternative. If your customers have a high-speed connection, they’re able
to browse your auctions through photographs. Some auction management
sites host your gallery. Some charge for this service; others do not. The best
part is that you can produce your own gallery without any fancy programs
or auction management software at no additional cost to you.
To make your own gallery on eBay without installing fancy scripts in your
listings, you need to do three things. You must include eBay gallery photos
with all the listings you want to appear in your gallery and put your user
name in the text of your item’s descriptions. Next, test the following URL in
your browser, substituting your own user ID where indicated in bold italics.
Figure 2-1 shows you a sample of what you will see.

Now that you’ve seen a sample of your gallery, insert the following HTML into
your auction to include a link to your gallery. As you can see in Figure 2-2,
this HTML sniplet also inserts the custom eBay button.

alt=”My Gallery on eBay”></a >
Sorting auction e-mail
A vital function of any auction software or system is the ability to customize
and send e-mails to your winners. Many sellers use the default letters, which
tend to be a bit — no, incredibly — impersonal and uncaring. You must decide
whether you want the program to receive e-mail as well.
Most computer-resident auction management programs (programs installed
on your own computer versus going online to do your business) have their
own built-in e-mail software. When you download your winner information
from eBay, the program automatically generates invoices and congratulatory
e-mails.
How to handle your auction-related e-mail is a personal choice. Although I
currently use eBay’s Selling Manager to send auction related e-mails, I receive
auction e-mail through Outlook, using a separate folder titled Auctions that
contains subfolders for eBay Buy and eBay Sell.
Automating end-of-auction e-mail
If you want to set up e-mails to be sent automatically after an auction ends,
you must use a software application. The software should download your
final auction results, generate the e-mail, and let you preview the e-mail
before sending it out. Many of the online sites discussed previously in this
chapter send out winner confirmation e-mails automatically when an auction
is over; be sure that you set your preferences to preview the e-mail before
sending if you want to use this option.

Keeping inventory
Many eBay PowerSellers depend on the old clipboard or notebook method —
crossing off items as they sell them. If that works for you, great. Others prefer
to use an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of inventory.
Most of the auction management packages detailed in this chapter handle
inventory for you. Some automatically deduct an item from inventory when
you launch an auction. You have your choice of handling inventory directly
on your computer or keeping your inventory online with a service that’s
accessible from any computer, wherever you are.
I handle my inventory on my desktop through QuickBooks. When I buy mer-
chandise to sell, and I post the bill to QuickBooks, it automatically puts the
merchandise into inventory. When I input my sale, it deducts the items sold
from standing inventory. I can print a status report whenever I want to see
how much I have left — or have to order.
Generating HTML
Fancy auctions are nice, but fancy doesn’t make the item sell any better.
Competitive pricing and low shipping rates work in your favor — especially
with eBay’s Compare Items feature in Search. Also, a clean listing with as many
photos as necessary goes a long way to sell your product. Some software
and services offer a large selection of templates to gussy up your auctions.
But you must think of your customers; many of them are still logging on with
dial-up connections, which are notoriously slow. The use of simple HTML
doesn’t slow the loading of your page, but the addition of miscellaneous
images (decorative backgrounds and animations) definitely makes viewing
your auction a chore for those dialing up. And forget the background music —
it really slows things down!
Don’t fret; you can make do by repeatedly incorporating two or three simple
HTML templates, cutting and pasting new text as necessary. Most auction
management programs offer you several template choices. I recommend that
you stick with a few that are similar, giving a standardized look to your listings,
just the way major companies give a standardized look to their advertising
and identity. Your customers will get used to the look of your auctions and
feel comfortable each time they open one.
I use CuteHTML to generate much of my code for auction descriptions. An
important line of code that everyone seems to forget is the one that inserts a
picture into your auction description. On the Sell Your Item page, click the
tab to view in HTML mode, and insert the following line below where you’d
like your image to appear in your description:
<img src=”http://www.yourserver.com/imagename.jpg”>

671
Be sure to substitute your own server and image name. If you want to put
one picture above another, type <P> and then repeat the HTML line with a
different image name.
If you’re in a rush and need a quick and easy HTML generator, go to my Web
site at www.coolebaytools.com and click Tools. In addition, Book V has
sample HTML code for auction descriptions as well as a chart of all the code
you’ll ever need for an eBay auction.
One-click relisting or selling similar
Using auction software or an auction service speeds up the process of posting
or relisting items. After you input your inventory into the software, posting or
relisting your auctions is a mouse click away. All the auction management soft-
ware packages that I detailed previously in this chapter include this feature.
If you buy your items in bulk, you might want to take advantage of eBay’s
free relisting tool. By clicking the Sell Similar link (see Figure 2-3) on any suc-
cessful listing, you can automatically relist your items. Sell Similar starts the
listing as new, so if it doesn’t sell you can avail yourself of the Relist feature.
This way, if the item sells the second time, your listing (insertion fees) for
the first listing will be credited.

Although eBay says that Sell Similar is for relisting items, it works also when
listing a duplicate of an item that has sold successfully. The only difference
is that you aren’t credited for the unsold auction listing fee.
One savvy seller I know uses the eBay Sell Similar feature to post new auc-
tions. She merely clicks the Sell Similar link, and then cuts and pastes her
new information into the existing HTML format. That’s why her auctions all
have the same feel and flavor.
Scheduling listings for bulk upload
If you want to schedule the unattended launch of your auctions without
incurring eBay’s $.10 fee, you must use an online management service
(check out the “Online auction management sites” section). If you can be
at your computer to send your auctions to eBay singly or in bulk, you
can use the Turbo Lister application, which eBay offers at no charge.
Hosting photos
If all you need is photo hosting, and you’ve checked out your ISP and they
don’t give you any free Web space to use (please check Book V for a list of
ISPs and the amount of Web storage space they give to their customers), you
can always use eBay’s Picture Services to host an additional picture in each
auction at $.15 an image.
Checking out
When someone wins or buys an item, eBay’s checkout integrates directly with
PayPal and also indicates your other preferred forms of payment. If you’re
closing more than 100 auctions a day, that’s all you need. eBay and PayPal
will also send an e-mail to you and the buyer so that you can arrange for 
payment.
Some online auction management services offer your own private checkout
area that costs you a percentage of your sale, so you must decide whether
your business warrants this option. A personalized winner’s notification e-mail
can easily contain a link to your PayPal payment area, making a checkout
service unnecessary.
Printing shipping labels
Printing shipping labels without printing postage can be the beginning of a
laborious two-step process. Two companies, Endicia.com and Stamps.com,
print your labels and postage all in one step. Check out Book VII, Chapter 1
for information on how this works.

Book VIII
Chapter 2
Mechanizing with

Management Tools

673
Some sites, as well as eBay’s Selling Manager, print your winner’s address
label without postage. That works well if you don’t mind carrying your pack-
ages to the post office for postage. (Why would you do that? A burning need
to stand in line, I guess!)
Tracking buyer information
Keeping track of your winners isn’t rocket science. You can do it in an Excel
spreadsheet or a Word document, both of which are exportable to almost
any program for follow-up mailings promoting future sales. If you choose to
have an online management service do this for you, be sure that you can
download the information to your computer (in case you and the online
service part ways someday).
Generating customized reports
Sales reports, ledgers, and tax information are all important reports that you
should have in your business. Online services and software supply different
flavors of these reports.
PayPal allows you to download your sales data into a format compatible
with QuickBooks, a highly respected and popular bookkeeping program.
You can also choose to download your data in Excel spreadsheet format
(the downloads also work in Microsoft Works). PayPal reports are chock full
of intensely detailed information about your sales and deposits. Putting this
information in a standard accounting software program on a regular basis
makes your year-end calculations easier to bear.
Submitting feedback
If you’re running a lot of auctions, leaving feedback can be a chore. One solu-
tion is to automate the submission of feedback through an online service or
software. But timing the automation of this task can be tricky.
Don’t leave feedback for an eBay transaction until after you’ve heard from
the buyer that the purchase is satisfactory. Leaving positive feedback imme-
diately after you’ve received payment from the buyer is too soon. After you
receive an e-mail assuring you that the customer is satisfied, manually leav-
ing feedback by going to the feedback forum (or the item page) can be just
as easy — if not easier — as bulk-loading feedback.

 Using a quality tool to increase sales
 Finding out when people visit your auctions
F
rom my background in advertising, I know that good quality research
can make the difference in whether a business endeavor is a success or
a failure. In my books and lectures, I always advocate the necessity of doing
at least the minimal research on any item’s eBay availability and current
selling pricing.
I also recommend using certain advanced counters (those that break down
Web page visits to hours and days, rather than showing only totals), because
just the number of people who click your page doesn’t tell you much. Wouldn’t
it be nice to know not only how many people visited your listing but what
page sent them there and what city they come from?
The problem with gathering this kind of information is that the coding and
programming involved is probably beyond the skill set of even top-level eBay
sellers. After all, they’re merchants, not computer programmers. In this chap-
ter, I tell you about eBay’s Store Traffic Reports, eBay Sales Reports Plus,
and an online service called ViewTracker that gives you all the research you
can use. eBay Traffic Reports and Sales Reports Plus are automatic for every
eBay store owner. (Sales Reports Plus can be purchased separately by sub-
scription for $4.99 a month.)
Best of all, this information, while important for your sales efforts, remains
noninvasive for your potential customers. For example, in ViewTracker, you
may find out the timeslots and keywords used by your listing visitors, but
you find out nothing that compromises their identities.
The information service presented in this chapter doesn’t turn your com-
puter into a data-mining robot. It merely gives you the information available
to every Web site on the Internet. That is, it gives you information such as
geographic location, which follows the IP address of all eBay users who visit
your listings. This service is not an invasion of privacy like the data-mining
cookies explained in the sidebar “Flushing out the moles.”

eBay Sales Reports Plus

Companies such as Mediaplex and DoubleClick make a living by placing
cookies on your computer as you browse the Internet. These cookies follow
your browsing trail and report your comings and goings to their mothership.
Mediaplex and DoubleClick sell that information to the big guys so they can
better figure out who their customers are. If you never want Mediaplex to
track your Internet browsing, go to http://mediaplex.com/web-cgi/
optout.cgi?optOut=1 and you will automatically be opted out on the com-
puter you’re using. To disengage DoubleClick from your Web roaming, visit
http://optout.doubleclick.net/cgi-bin/dclk/optout.pl to opt out.
eBay Sales Reports Plus
eBay offers a useful tool to track your sales in one place. No longer do you
need to download sales files, place them on a spreadsheet, and start to
cipher — its all done for you. You can view the report at any time from your
My eBay page, and see an instant graphic chart of your sales progress. Take
a look at my current Sales Reports Plus report in Figure 3-1.
You’ll get the following sales information:
✦Total sales: The total revenue generated by sales of your items by
month.
✦Month-to-month sales growth: The percentage of increase (or decrease)
of your gross revenue from month to month. It may also be viewed week
to week.
✦Ended listings: The total number of listings completed during the
month.
✦Ended items: The number of items represented in your ended listings.
(Store and fixed-price listings usually represent multiple quantities.)
✦Successful items #: The total number of listings that ended with a buyer.
Flushing out the moles
There’s no place to hide on the Internet: Every
one of your keystrokes and visits to Web sites
can be traced back to you. There’s big money
in this data as well. If you’ve ever used a pro-
gram like Spybot Search & Destroy (a program
that finds data-mining programs that have been
placed on your computer when you visit certain
Web sites), you know how much more data sites
want about their visitors. My daughter down-
loaded the free version of Spybot and found 632
data-mining cookies slowing down her com-
puter! Spybot can be downloaded for free from
many sites; just Google Spybot to find it.

✦Successful items %: The percent of items that sold in your successful
listings.
✦Average sale price per item: The average of the final value of your sold
items.
✦Total buyers: The total number of winning buyers that purchased items
from you.
✦Unique buyers: The total of unique (one user ID) buyers that purchased
from you. If a buyer purchased several items from you over the month,
they are counted only once in this figure.
✦Repeat buyers %: The percent of buyers who shopped with you more
then once within the time period.
Thank goodness eBay also supplies data on fees. eBay fees (listing, options,
and final value fees) can often get out of control and cause a seller to spiral
downward quickly. Here you can see your total eBay fees (less any credits)
as well as your total PayPal fees. Sadly, you’ll have to work out the fees as a
percentage of your sales yourself:
Fee percentage = (net eBay and PayPal fees / total sales) * 100
You’ll also get to see how many unpaid item reminders you filed, how many
final value fee refunds you claimed, and the percentage of unpaid items as a
percentage of your total sales. You will not see the actual dollar figure.

You can also access this data segregated by auctions, fixed-price sales, and
store items.
Lastly, you can see which days of the week were most successful for you and
your average price per item. You get this data in chart format, as shown in
Figure 3-2, and in text. Although nothing can replace using a quality book-
keeping program such as QuickBooks, these reports can give you good sales
data at a glance.
Using Sellathon ViewTracker
ViewTracker from Sellathon answers the most popular questions I’m asked
by eBay sellers. Before ViewTracker, when trying to figure out the exact time
and day to end an auction, you had to do a considerable amount of research
by running test auctions on the eBay site. Now you can follow the body clocks
of your buyers and find out when they search for your type of item.

eBay store traffic reports
When you have an eBay store, you will also have
access to traffic reports supplied by Omniture.
These reports give you data on the number of
hits to various pages in your store. You’ll also
be able to compare present data with previous
periods. The reports are an incredibly useful
tool for historical data.

You will also find out (I just love this!) which keywords the browser was using
when he or she came to your listing. This information is crucial when writing
titles — and planning keyword campaigns.
Here’s a partial list of the type of data you can get by using the ViewTracker
system:
✦Sequential number of the visitor. Is this the 19th visitor or the 104th —
and did this person come back again?
✦Date and time the visitor arrived at your auction.
✦Visitor’s IP address. (By clicking the IP address in the Sellathon screen,
you can see only those visits originating from this IP address.)
✦What city, state, and country your visitor is from.
✦Whether the reserve price was met when the visitor arrived.
✦When the item receives a bid (and how many have been placed to that
moment).
✦Whether the current visitor is the high bidder, a bidder who has been
outbid, or not a bidder.
✦Whether the visitor has chosen to watch this listing in his or her My
eBay page.
✦Whether the visitor browsed a category, searched a category, searched
all of eBay, used eBay’s Product Finder utility, or came from See Seller’s
Other Items page or some other page.
• If they were browsing, which category were they browsing when they
clicked your listing?
• If searching, what search terms did they use to find your item?
• If they were searching when they came upon your item, did the visi-
tor search titles only or titles and descriptions?
✦Whether the user elected to view Auctions Only, Buy it Now, or both.
✦Whether the user refined his or her searches using specific parameters,
including: Show/Hide pictures, Sellers that accept PayPal, Price Range,
International Availability, Regional Searching, Gallery View, and Show
Gift Items.
✦Was there a preference in the way the user sorted his or her search
results? Did they search items from high price to low price?
Amazing stuff, eh? By applying the information from ViewTracker, you can
change tactics to help your little business become a big one. You’ll be able
to customize your items to match your very own eBay market.

Using Sellathon ViewTracker

Setting up your account is painless. After you give your contact information
to Sellathon (and make up a new user ID and password for the site), you are
presented with a small amount of code to add to your listing’s description.
It’s that easy.
Checking out your data
In this section, I show you a portion of the data screens from my ViewTracker
account. But keep one thing in mind. I’ve been busy writing this book, so I
haven’t had much time to list tons of items on eBay. The few I have listed
(I have to keep up my status as a PowerSeller!) will give you a good idea of
what you’ll see.
When you first log on to ViewTracker, you’ll be presented with your General
(Combined items) page. Here you’ll see a couple of statistics. Keep in mind
that ViewTracker constantly tracks your items in real time, so the data may
change by the minute as you’re changing screens within the program!
After you log on to your account, you see a snapshot of your current sales
activity and a graph showing your views (hits) over the past 24 hours, as
shown in Figure 3-3.

On the initial home page, you’ll see some other very interesting data:
✦The total value of all bids placed on your auctions, the number of people
watching your items, the average visits per auction, and the total hits on
all your items.
✦A listing of your live and expired auctions. You can click links here to get
general information on all your auctions, or click the folder to view infor-
mation on individual items.
Although I don’t really want to give away any of my deep dark secrets, I can
show you a few screens of data from my expired (closed items) so you know
what to look for. The first, in Figure 3-4, shows the most active time of the
day for my auctions by hits.
The next graph you access is the most active day of the week. Figure 3-5 is a
portion of the composite report for all my auctions. Think how valuable this
data would be when you analyze data from auctions from a similar category.
For example, golf equipment, DVD, women’s apparel — you get the picture.
Remember, this data covers all my listings; this isn’t for one particular item
(although you can get that data as well).

Figure 3-4 was captured mid-day on the Sunday before Valentine’s Day
(February 14th) 2005. Compare that to Figure 3-6, which was taken in
Spring 2004. Note the differences in the hit pattern. The comparison clearly
demonstrates how important it is to stay on top of these statistics.
There is also a chart that shows you the way people came to your auc-
tions. This is the best way to see whether things you’ve been doing to
boost sales are working. For example, are you taking the best advantage
of targeting your cross-promotions? Does your Web site send people to
your eBay listings?
Other data graphs are available, but the very best is the Top Search Terms
Used to find your items. This chart will give you definitive data so you’ll
know which keywords to include in your titles. (Sorry, I’d love to show you
my top keywords, but that’s a secret! When you work up a list of your own,
you’ll know exactly where I’m coming from.)
Getting additional information from your listings
With ViewTracker, you can also view data for individual listings. Figure 3-7
shows you data from a quick auction that ended with a Buy It Now transac-
tion. The data collected and shown here is combined with data from other
listings to make up the charts and statistics shown in the figures in this

 Getting the SquareTrade seal
 Understanding the bonding process
C
ompetition for the buyer’s dollars is fierce on eBay. New users arrive at
the site with three predetermined concepts about eBay:
✦They’re going to find fun and unique items.
✦They’re going to get a deal.
✦There’s a good chance they’ll get ripped off.
For those of us selling on eBay, that last comment hits us right in the gut.
Most of us work hard to make each customer’s experience a good one on
the site, and hate it when the 1/100 of 1 percent of bad sellers get all the
publicity.
You can counter the public’s misconception that eBay sellers are dishonest
in two ways: by getting a SquareTrade seal and (ultimately) by getting your
listings bonded through BuySAFE. In this chapter, I explain both programs
and show you how they can boost your bottom line — and help you avoid
getting negative feedback.
Benefiting from the SquareTrade Seal
SquareTrade doesn’t give a seller a stamp of approval; it’s technically a seal.
But whether stamp or seal, having this small icon associated with your
items can boost your sales quite a bit. This seal is the most widely recog-
nized symbol of trust on eBay; and you can view it in about two million 
listings a day.
The SquareTrade seal is a known commodity in the eBay community with
buyers and sellers alike. When buyers see the SquareTrade seal in an auc-
tion, it’s an immediate tip-off that they’re doing business with a reliable,
honest seller.

Benefiting from the SquareTrade Seal
686
In this section you find out how to get the SquareTrade seal with its associ-
ated services and reports to work for you, the seller. One of the best benefits
is that showing the seal lowers the occurrence of negative feedback. When
people view the seal on your auctions, they feel more trusting and at ease
with buying from you. So if the transaction has a glitch, they’re far less apt to
fly off the handle and leave you negative feedback without contacting you.
SquareTrade conducted a survey that included a study of 130,000 feedback
ratings among 600 of its seal members and found an astounding result. The
average seller noticed a remarkable 43% decrease in negative feedback after
becoming a member. That’s pretty amazing. Although there’s no guarantee that
you won’t get negative feedback (and you still need to watch your Ps & Qs),
the SquareTrade seal certainly seems to calm buyers’ nerves.
SquareTrade stretches beyond eBay
SquareTrade began operations in 1999 to service eBay sellers and to help
them handle disputes in transactions. The company grew steadily over the
years and established itself as an international leader in online dispute reso-
lution. SquareTrade has acted as key presenter on the issue of global online
consumer protection to the Federal Trade Commission, the European Union,
and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.
It’s nice to know that a company working for eBay members is so well
respected worldwide. For eBay sellers who subscribe to the seal, SquareTrade
offers many worthwhile tools to help build their reputations and their busi-
nesses on eBay.
Internet seals of safety
When you travel the Internet, you see many
seals. You hope that the seals you see legiti-
mately stand for something and that the Web
sites using them follow standards that ensure
some level of quality. Two of the most trusted
seals are
 BBBOnLine: The BBBOnLine seal qualify-
ing process, like that for the SquareTrade
seal, investigates candidate seal holders to
make sure they’re who they say they are.
Seal members also agree to participate 
in arbitration and to accept visits from 
BBB (Better Business Bureau) officials.
The seal can cost between $400 and $500
for small businesses and up to $5000 for
larger corporations.
 TrustE: Web sites may post a TrustE seal
provided that the site posts a privacy state-
ment and sticks to it. TrustE will investigate
complaints about member sites and yank
the site’s seal if necessary. For TrustE mem-
bers with annual sales below $1,000,000,
the TrustE seal costs around $250. The price
goes up to $5000 for larger firms.
Although posting a well-known seal costs you
money, doing so has proven to be a business
tactic that makes customers feel at ease.

Making SquareTrade work for you
The best part about subscribing to SquareTrade (and the main reason most
sellers join) is that members get to show off the seal and so become seal hold-
ers. That ubiquitous lime-green-and-navy-blue seal builds business. When
potential buyers view your eBay listings, they see a seal marked with the
current date. SquareTrade updates the seal daily and roots out sellers who
have possibly joined the dark side.
SquareTrade runs 40 automated compliance checks on seal holders daily.
Anytime there’s an automated alert, a SquareTrade employee checks to see
what’s occurring with the seal holder’s account and may then contact the
seal holder for further information. Figure 4-1 shows my SquareTrade seal.
You may notice variances in the SquareTrade seals that you see online.
That’s because there’s a basic seal and the Professional Seller seal. The
Professional Seller seal is available to licensed businesses or credentialed
professionals. Figure 4-1 shows you the basic seal.
A clickable link appears to the left or below the seal. When the prospective
buyer clicks it, your SquareTrade profile opens up in another window.
If the seller is deemed as a Verified Professional Seller (and pays the addi-
tional SquareTrade fees), you’ll see a Professional Seller seal, as shown in
Figure 4-2. Note that there’s also a clickable link in the seal.
Sellers can customize the look of the SquareTrade seal and can choose
whether it appears at the top or bottom of their item descriptions. I like to
have the seal appear at the top so that buyers readily see the seal as they
read the item listing.

In addition to the handy seal, SquareTrade offers sellers some other good
tools and services:
✦Automatic seal posting: If you don’t want to mess with HTML every time
you list an item (and who does?), you can set your seal preferences to
post automatically. Then once a day, SquareTrade will post the seal to
any new listings you’ve placed on eBay.
✦Seal activity reports: If you like the idea of putting counters in your 
auctions to see how many visitors you get, the seal activity reports
give you totals (for a time period) of how often your seal has been dis-
played. Figure 4-3 shows a segment of my current seal activity reports.
I find it amazing that so many people have viewed my auctions during
these time periods. (I don’t keep many items listed when I’m writing a
book.) These totals are a testament to the number of people who visit
eBay every day.
✦SquareTrade Business Center eBay sales reports: As a seal holder,
you’ll be able to log on to your account on the SquareTrade Web site and
view a large array of reports reflecting your eBay business. Basic level
seal holders can view reports with the following information:
• Average selling price
• Price comparison sold versus unsold
• Percent of listings that sold successfully
• Monthly sales
• Number of listings sold
• Average number of bids per sold listings
• Bids per auction pie chart
• Feedback growth summary
Figure 4-4 shows a couple of sample reports from my Business Reporting
Center.
✦Seal rewards: If another eBay member signs up as a SquareTrade member
through the seal link in your listings, you receive $5 for the referral. This
is redeemable in auction services, gift certificates, and more. If people
sign up through your link on a regular basis, the rewards can pay for
your SquareTrade membership in no time!
✦Negative feedback notification: You have the option of having
SquareTrade notify you whenever (horrors!) negative feedback is
posted to your account. SquareTrade then works with you and the
other party through mediation to try to get the negative feedback
removed or withdrawn.

✦Buyer protection program: When you’re a seal holder, your buyers are

this program, see Book I, Chapter 5.)
✦Buyer alert e-mails: If you opt for the buyer alert service, SquareTrade
sends your bidders an e-mail on your behalf letting them know that you
are committed to giving them a good buying experience.

Getting your own seal
Having a SquareTrade seal sounds like a pretty sweet deal. And sweet deals
usually have a catch or two. With SquareTrade, the catches are
✦You have to qualify for the seal
✦You have to pay for your seal subscription
To qualify for the SquareTrade seal, you must go through an approval process
that takes two to five days. From any seal holder’s profile, click the See If You
Qualify link and take advantage of the 30-day free trial to get the ball rolling.
You start by supplying information to SquareTrade, and SquareTrade investi-
gates your info in two areas:
✦Personal information: Most seal applicants are verified through Equifax,
a prominent identity verification service. SquareTrade checks your 
information against Equifax’s consumer and business databases for 
consistency.
✦eBay selling history: SquareTrade runs 20 different checks on your eBay
transaction history through systems developed to identify at-risk sellers
from their feedback information, as well as from the products bought
and sold.
After SquareTrade notifies you (through e-mail) that you’re approved, you have
to pay SquareTrade for the right to become a seal holder. As of this writing,
the basic seal holder gets an initial 30-day free trial and then pays $7.50 per
month for all the services described in the section “Making SquareTrade
work for you.” You can also choose a premium level of services that offers
more reports at a higher monthly fee.
Using mediation and dispute resolution services
Even the best of friends sometimes have misunderstandings that can escalate
to all-out war if they don’t resolve their problems early enough. If the going gets
tough, you need to call in the heavy artillery: a mediator. Just as pro boxing
has its referees, auctions may need a level head to intervene in any squabble.
Acting as a third party with no axe to grind, a mediator such as SquareTrade
can often hammer out an agreement or act as judge to resolve disputes.
If you file a complaint through the SquareTrade link, the service asks you to
supply information regarding the offending transaction on an online form.
SquareTrade then sends an e-mail to the offending party, outlining the situa-
tion. Both the complaint and the response from the other party appear on a
secure Web page that only the offender, the mediator, and you can access.
SquareTrade uses a patent-pending technology to help smooth the media-
tion process. The mediator listens to both points of view and, if the parties

can’t reach an agreement, suggests a solution based on the rules of fair play
and good conduct. However, the use of a mediator doesn’t preclude the use
of a lawyer if things truly hit an impasse.
To find SquareTrade at eBay, click the Dispute Resolution link in the Trust
and Safety area of the Services page.
Bonding Your Sales with buySAFE
When it comes to high-dollar transactions on eBay, in the past the only thing
a seller could throw into the sale was escrow. Escrow is a great way to 
protect the buyer, but it ties up the seller’s money for considerably longer
than necessary. The best legitimate escrow company currently on eBay is
escrow.com.
Lately there have been many scandals in the online escrow arena. Fraudsters
put up bogus Web sites, offer expensive items for sale online, and then run the
escrow through their bogus site. The buyer, thinking everything is legit, sends
their money. After the money arrives, however, the Web site is taken down and
the bad guys have the money. A Web site called www.sos4auctions.com has
a database of fraudulent escrow Web sites and a discussion area where people
discuss and report ongoing frauds. Escrow has gotten a bad reputation with
buyers. The issue is so serious that if you go to the escrow.com Web site
area at https://escrow.com/fic/, you’ll find helpful information on how
to recognize escrow fraud.
There’s finally a viable alternative to escrow. Something that will make the
customer feel good about spending buckets of money on your site. Bonding.
It’s all about potato chips, beer, and Monday Night Football. No, wait, that’s
male bonding. The bonding we’re talking about here refers to guaranteeing
that a seller will perform as advertised.
All about bonding
A bond warrants that the person (or business) performing the task will com-
plete his or her part of the deal as contracted.
A bond is not insurance. Insurance assumes that a loss is a possibility. A
bond guarantees that a buyer will not suffer a financial loss.
The buySAFE company (an eBay certified developer) has come up with a tra-
ditional bonding plan exclusively for eBay sellers. buySAFE procures surety
bonds through companies such as Liberty Mutual (one of America’s largest
financial services provider) to bond eBay sellers’ transactions. The bond
provides that Liberty Mutual will refund the item sale price or replace the
item if the seller does not perform as promised in the item listing.

Bonding Your Sales with buySAFE
692
The bond can protect buyers when
✦The bonded seller fails to deliver the item
✦The seller delivers an item different from the one described and pictured
in the item listing
✦The seller offers a return or refund policy but refuses to honor it
✦The seller fails to use the shipping method as described in the item listing
and the item arrives damaged (as when the buyer pays for insurance,
but the seller fails to insure the package)
✦The seller refuses to follow the payment policy described in the item listing
✦The seller experiences financial setbacks and does not fulfill the condi-
tions of the sale
A bond basically guarantees that the seller will perform, period. Bonding
your auctions tells your prospective bidders that you care about the buyer,
and that you’re a professional seller. This assurance easily can translate into
more bids and higher final selling prices.
The best part? The seller receives his or her money through regular channels
and doesn’t have to ship the item until paid. No waiting around for weeks to
get your money because, as is the case with an escrow, you’re at the mercy
of the system.
I thought bonding was just for high-dollar transactions, but not so! I’ve heard
from small-time sellers that their total number of bids and their final selling
price increased by one-third after bonding all their items (even the $5 sales!)
with the buySAFE seal.
When one of your items is bonded, a seal is displayed, like the one shown in
Figure 4-5. If prospective buyers click it, they see the details of what the seal
represents.
Seller bonding on eBay
You may be wondering whether getting your items bonded on eBay is a big
deal. It’s not really. Here’s how it works.
Figure 4-5:
This item is
bonded!

Book VIII
Chapter 4

Outside Assurance
Bonding Your Sales with buySAFE

Your auctions can get bonded up to a total prescribed dollar amount. The total
amount of bonded auctions cannot exceed this figure. Think of the maximum
like a line of credit. You can draw against it until you’ve maxed out your line.
(The maximum bond coverage per item is $25,000!)
To become bonded, you must meet some minimum requirements:
✦$1000 a month in eBay sales
✦An eBay feedback rating of 100
✦eBay feedback that’s 98% positive
✦An eBay business based in the United States (but not in the state of
Hawaii)
If you fulfill those requirements, you then fill out a form on the buySAFE Web
site, which asks you information about yourself and your business. After
applying, you undergo a thorough qualification process that evaluates your
online sales experience and reputation; verifies your identity; and analyzes
your financial stability. Then you must also legally commit to either honor-
ing their terms of sale or repaying any losses that you may inflict.
Yes, you may have great feedback, but bonding is not about the people who
are already buying from you — the point is to attract new buyers with a signal
that proves you’re professional and rock solid.
Bonding items
After you receive approval and know your total bonding amount (based on
how you were qualified), you may choose which of your auctions to bond
and which not to bond.
The auctions you choose to bond cost you 1% of the final selling price. If the
bonded item sells for, say, $3.00 (shipping, handling fees, and taxes are not
included in the bonded total), your fee is $.03. You pay nothing in advance,
there are no hidden fees or commitments, and there is no minimum fee. You
don’t pay a fee if a bonded item doesn’t sell.
A sample Bonded Seller’s Log In page at buySAFE is shown in Figure 4-6. At a
glance, you can see any of your items that aren’t bonded as well as your total
bonding limit, bonds outstanding (bonds on a sold item are kept open for
30 days), and the total of your bonded transactions. Note that live help is
also available, should you have a question during business hours.
To take a look at your bonded transactions, click the Bonded Transactions
tab, as shown in Figure 4-7. Here you can see any open items with bonds and
view any problems that may have arisen.

If you click the item title, you can see the details of an open auction, as
shown in Figure 4-8.
What happens when something goes wrong?
When a buyer feels slighted in a transaction, that customer is still yours to
solve the problem with. If the customer contacts buySAFE, he or she is sent
directly back to you.
If, for some reason, the customer still insists on help resolving the issue, he
or she may fill out a problem transaction report on the buySAFE Web site,
stating the problem and what the seller can do to resolve the issue. On your
Seller Services page, you’ll see a red View Problem button. Click it to display
the Problem Summary page, and then click the Problem button to see the
buyer’s comments.
An e-mail is sent to you, and your response is recorded. If nothing has been
solved after two e-mail exchanges, a professional mediator (a claims repre-
sentative) joins in to solve the problem.
Figure 4-8:

Bonding Your Sales with buySAFE
696
There is no charge for the mediation. The mediator may contact both the
buyer and seller by phone to get both sides of the story. A bond from a
surety company, such as Liberty Mutual, is a legal obligation to protect both
parties. The bond protects the seller from false allegations and the buyer from
losing his or her money. If no compromise is made, the mediator will make a
binding decision, based on the evidence provided, in favor of one party or
the other.
Liberty Mutual is regulated by each state’s insurance department and is held
accountable by them for adequately investigating each claim. Bonding is the
only licensed and regulated form of seller guarantee.
Although bonding is new to eBay, it has proven to be successful with many
sellers. If you’d like to give it a whirl, go to

Chapter 5: Becoming a PowerSeller
In This Chapter
 Qualifying for PowerSeller status
 Moving up the tiers
 Understanding the benefits
W
hen you browse through the items on eBay, you’re bound to notice a
PowerSeller icon next to a member’s user ID. To the uninitiated, this
may look like an award given to a used car salesman for bullying hundreds of
people into expensive car leases — but it’s not. The eBay PowerSeller status
is given only to those sellers who uphold the highest levels of professionalism
on the site. Take a look at mine in Figure 5-1.
eBay refers to PowerSellers as “pillars of the community.” I say they’re smart
businesspeople. PowerSellers have to maintain certain monthly levels of gross
merchandise sales (total dollar amount of eBay sales — GMS in eBay-speak),
and they get there by providing good items for sale and excellent customer
service.
You may notice that many sellers on the site with feedback ratings in the
tens of thousands do not have the PowerSeller embellishment on their auc-
tions. That’s not because they’re not good people; it’s just that some of their
transactions may have gone awry and resulted in negative feedback. In this
case, be sure to check the seller’s feedback and thoughtfully evaluate it. Many
times buyers do not read the seller’s policies before they buy and then give
negative feedback (as in the case of buyers not reading the seller’s warnings
when buying liquidation merchandise).
Figure 5-1:
My proudly

First Steps to PowerSeller Status

First Steps to PowerSeller Status
To become a PowerSeller on eBay, you must fulfill the following requirements:
✦Be an active seller for at least 90 days
✦Sell a minimum of four items on the site per month for the past three
months
✦Sell a minimum average of $1000 in GMS (gross monthly sales)
✦Have a minimum feedback rating of 100
✦Maintain at least a 98 feedback percentage
✦Keep your eBay account current
✦Comply with all eBay listing policies
✦Run your business by upholding eBay’s community values (see sidebar)
eBay sends you a notification when you qualify. If you feel you have qualified
and may have accidentally deleted the e-mail, find the PowerSeller’s page
from the Services link and attempt to log in.
PowerSeller Tiers
Being a PowerSeller gives you membership in an exclusive club. That club
has five levels of membership, depending on your monthly sales, as shown
in Table 5-1. Each PowerSeller tier gives the seller more privileges from eBay.
One of the most valuable benefits is that when an issue needs to be addressed
with eBay, PowerSellers can access priority customer service support.
eBay community values
The eBay community values aren’t taken lightly
by the eBay community and eBay employees.
The values were set out early on by the com-
pany’s founder, Pierre Omidyar.
 We believe people are basically good.
 We believe everyone has something to
contribute.
 We believe that an honest, open environ-
ment can bring out the best in people.
 We recognize and respect everyone as a
unique individual.
 We encourage you to treat others the way
that you want to be treated.
All eBay sellers are expected to uphold these
tenets in all their dealings on the site. Okay, no
snickering from the peanut gallery; we all know
that quite a few sellers don’t follow these 
precepts. But then, they’re not PowerSellers,
are they?

Chapter 6: Opening 
Your eBay Store
In This Chapter
 Figuring out the lure of the online shop
 Understanding the costs
 Setting up an eBay store
 Marketing and making a sale
I
f you’re doing well selling your items on eBay auctions, why open a store?
Well, have you used the eBay Buy It Now feature in one of your listings?
Did it work? In an eBay store, all items are set at a fixed price and remain
online until canceled (or listed for as few as 30 days), so it’s kind of like a
giant collection of Buy It Now featured items. Get the idea?
When you’re opening a store, you have just three main rules to remember
and apply: location, location, location. If you were going to open a brick-and-
mortar store, you could open it, for example, in the corner strip mall, at a
shopping center, or even somewhere downtown. You’d have to decide in
what location your store would do best; that goes for an online store as well.
You’ll find tons of locations to open an online store, including online malls
(when you can find them) and sites such as Amazon.com, Yahoo!, and, of
course, eBay.
You have to pay rent for your online store, but opening and running an online
store isn’t nearly as expensive as a store in the real world (where you also
have to pay electrical bills, maintenance bills, and more). Plus, the ratio of
rent to sales makes an online store a much easier financial decision, and
your exposure can be huge.
Opening an eBay store can expand your business. The more that savvy
buyers learn about eBay stores, the more popular they become. The more
popular they become, the more people buy from them. Simple. An eBay store
provides you with your own little corner of eBay where you can leverage
your good relationships with your customers and sell directly to them. But
eBay stores are not a total solution, and having an eBay store isn’t a one-
way ticket to easy street.

Online Stores Galore
702
I get e-mails all the time from people who open an eBay store and are not
successful in moving merchandise. Why? Because running an eBay store takes
an extra level of effort. Simple. No matter how many money-back guarantees
you receive from online spammers promising magical success on eBay, the
only magic is putting your shoulder to the grindstone and exerting the effort
necessary to bring customers to your store.
eBay wants you to succeed as well. After all, the more you sell, the more
eBay earns in final value fees.
If you’re just beginning on eBay, the best advice I can give is to hold off on
opening an eBay store until your feedback rating is over 100. Participating in
transactions on eBay is a natural teacher because you’ll see mistakes that
sellers make when they sell to you. Sellers will send you e-mails that are
plain unfriendly, and you’ll have a true understanding of how quality cus-
tomer service will help you build your business. You’ll also learn from your
own mistakes and be able to provide better service to your customers.
Online Stores Galore
Amazon.com, Yahoo!, and eBay make up the big three of online stores.
They’re the top locations and get the most visitors. According to comScore
Media Metrix, in April 2004 these sites garnished an astounding number of
unique visitors (counting all of one person’s visits to the sites just once a
month):
✦Yahoo!: 113,190,000 (it’s a search engine; I must hit it ten times a day —
but I rarely visit the auctions)
✦eBay: 60,016,000
✦Amazon.com: 39,083,000 (it sells books, CDs, DVDs, and lots of other
merchandise, but how many of these people are going to the zShops?)
No doubt feeling competition from Yahoo! and Amazon.com, eBay decided to
open its doors (in July 2001) to sellers who wanted their own stores. The fixed-
price stores were a normal progression for eBay in its quest to continue as
the world’s marketplace. And eBay stores make sense: They’re a benefit to
all current eBay sellers and open doors to new shoppers who don’t want to
deal with auctions.
eBay is an online store that specializes in selling your stuff, not theirs. It doesn’t
stock a stick of merchandise and it isn’t in competition with you. In addition
to its staggering number of visitors, eBay offers you the most reasonable
store rent, as shown in Table 6-1.

I don’t think it’s going to take a rocket scientist to convince you that having a
space in eBay stores (see Figure 6-1) is an excellent bargain. Keep in mind
that eBay is based on merchandise sales, and the public actively shops eBay
stores. I know the stores aren’t based on auctions, but Buy It Now items are
as easy to handle as auctions. To review prices and rules before opening your
store, go to
pages.ebay.com/storefronts/seller-landing.html
Deciding to Open a Store
So you think it’s time to open a store, eh? If you feel it in your gut and you’re
ready to take the leap, here’s what you need to know. eBay has few require-
ments when it comes to opening an eBay store:
Figure 6-1:

page.

Deciding to Open a Store
704
✦Registered user: You need to be a registered user on the eBay site.
✦Feedback rating: You must have a feedback rating of 20 or higher, or be
ID verified, or have a PayPal account in good standing.
It doesn’t get much easier than that! Personally, I like to add these additional
prerequisites to back you up for success:
✦PayPal account: You need to have a business or premier (personal) PayPal
account to accept credit cards. Accepting credit cards is a necessity for
building sales, and PayPal is integrated into the site, as well as being
widely accepted by buyers.
Be sure you understand how a PayPal account works so you can decide
on the types of payments you will accept — and from which countries
you intend to do business.
✦Sales experience: Having selling (and buying) experience over and above
the 20 transactions required by eBay is a big plus. The best teacher
(aside from this book) is the school of hard knocks.
✦Merchandise: Opening an eBay store with only one each of ten items
isn’t a good idea. You need to have enough merchandise to support 
consistent sales in your store.
✦Devotion: You need to have the time to check into your eBay business
at least once a day, and the time to ship the purchased merchandise in a
prompt manner.
The items listed as store inventory will not come up in an eBay search
unless eBay can come up with ten or less of the item searched for. The only
way new buyers can find your store inventory is by clicking the Find Items in
eBay Stores link in eBay Search, by searching items on the store hub page
(as shown in Figure 6-2), or by clicking from one of your auction pages to see
what else you have on sale.
Choosing between store types
All eBay stores are on a level playing field. They’re all equally searchable for
the eBay Stores hub page, so you can be right up there with the big guys and
compete. The only cost differential is the type of store you want to open.
All eBay stores have the following in common:
✦Listings: All your eBay listings, whether auction, fixed-price, or store
inventory, will appear in your eBay store.
✦Custom URL: Your eBay store will have its own Internet address that you
can use in links in promotional material — even to promote your store
on the Internet.

Book VIII
Chapter 6
Opening Your 
eBay Store
Deciding to Open a Store
705
✦Store search: When customers visit your eBay store, they will be able to
search within your listings for their desired item — with your own per-
sonal search engine.
✦Cross-promotions: You have the ability to insert thumbnail promotions
for your store items within each of your items for sale on the regular
eBay site.
✦Seller reports: You’ll receive monthly reports on your store sales via
e-mail.
Although you will need to pay a small fee for each listing, eBay store rental is
available on three levels:
✦Basic store: For $15.95 a month, you get your own eBay store with all the
benefits.
✦Featured store: You get all the benefits of a basic store, plus there will
be a link to your store from the store category page and randomly on
the eBay Stores hub page. You also get more advanced sales reports.
This type of store will set you back $49.95 per month.
✦Anchor store: This is a top-of-the-line store on eBay. For $499.95 a month,
your store logo rotates with others on the eBay Stores hub page. Your
logo also randomly appears on eBay’s home page. When prospective
buyers are browsing eBay store categories, you logo will show up at the
top of the pages.

Stores hub.

706
There is no limit to the number of items you put up for sale in the basic store.
An anchor store can have as few or as many items as the basic store.
Many high-level PowerSellers find that the basic eBay store fulfills their
needs.
When people visit your eBay store, they have no way of knowing whether
you have a basic, featured, or anchor store. The design of your store is up
to you — you can make it as fancy as you want.
Knowing the fee structure
When you have an eBay store, other fees are involved (are you surprised?)
in addition to the rental fee: listing fees, options fees, and final value fees.
First up, the listing fees, which are shown in Table 6-2.
How to save 75% on your store final value fees
Yes! The honchos at eBay are really smart. By
promoting your eBay store on your Web site and
linking to your eBay store, you can save 75% of
your final value fees on the items you sell through
the referral link. It’s a win-win situation. You draw
people to your eBay store, where you can have
a more robust layout and features, and save on
fees — and eBay gets more visitors coming to
the site!
To get the referral bonus, you must set up a
special link consisting of your eBay store URL
and some code. Here’s my referral link, with the
referral code in boldface text:
http://stores.ebay.com/marsha-
colliersfabulousfinds?refid
=store
This code can also be used in promotional
e-mails that you send out. The only bad thing is
that customers have to purchase the item during
the same browser session as when they enter
your store from outside eBay.
It’s definitely worth a try! Check out the figure to
see a part of one of my eBay invoices; it shows
how the savings can stack up!

Listing your items for a looong time may be a tempting way to automate
your listings — and it’s a good strategy. However, after someone makes a
purchase from an item listing, you can no longer make description changes;
you can only update inventory. If you have a new picture or new ideas for a
title or a description, you must close that listing and relist the item with the
new information. Also, if you have an unpaid item, you must close the store
listing to file for your final value fee refund. But heck, it’s only $.02!
Items in an eBay store carry a similar fee structure as items listed on the eBay
site, but the actual numbers and percentages are different. The difference
in cost helps you decide which items to put in your store, your auctions, or
your Web site. Knowing the prices in Tables 6-3 and 6-4 up front helps you to
decide what you need to get for each item in the different sales formats.

Your eBay store name
You’ve decided to take the plunge and open an eBay store. Have you thought
of a good name for your store? Your store name doesn’t have to match your
eBay user ID, but they’re more recognizable if they relate to each other. You
can use your company name, your business name, or a name that describes
your business. I recommend that you use the same name for your eBay store
that you plan to use in all your online businesses. By doing so, you’ll begin
to create an identity (or as the pros call it, a brand) that customers will come
to recognize and trust.
Your online eBay store should not replace your Web site (see Book VI); it
should be an extension of it. When people shop at your eBay store, take the
opportunity to make them customers of your Web site through your store’s
About the Seller page (which is also your About Me page on eBay). Good deal!
Setting Up Shop
It’s time to get down to business. Go to the eBay Stores hub and click the
Key Benefits of eBay Stores link (under For Sellers), on the right side of the
screen (refer to Figure 6-2). This takes you to the Seller’s hub of eBay Stores.
If you click all the links you see here, you get the eBay company line about
Mind your underscores and hyphens
If you want to use your eBay user ID for your
store name, you can — unless it contains a
hyphen (-) or an underscore (_). Remember
how eBay recommends that you break up
words in your user ID with a dash or an under-
score? Uh oh, that’s no good for an eBay store
name. I’m in that situation. My user ID is
marsha_c; without the underscore, it translates
into a user ID that someone else has already
taken! Even though it hasn’t been used since
1999, someone else has it, which means I can’t
use it. (marsha_c is probably a crummy name
for a store anyway!) A favorite seller of mine —
mrswarren — realized that mrswarren isn’t a
good name for a store either. So she named her
store Pretty Girlie Things, which suits her mer-
chandise to a T.

how good an eBay store can be for your business. You already know how
good an eBay store can be for your business, so skip the propaganda and get
right down to business (but don’t forget to check for any policy changes that
may affect your store’s operations).
Before you click that link to open your store, ask yourself two questions:
✦Can I make a serious commitment to my eBay store? A store is a com-
mitment. It won’t work for you unless you work for it. You have to have
the merchandise to fill it and the discipline to continue listing store and
auction items. Your store is a daily, monthly, and yearly obligation.
When you go on vacation, you need someone else to ship your items;
otherwise, your customers may go elsewhere. You can use the eBay
store’s Vacation Feature and eBay will either close your items or put up
a notification letting your customers know that you’re on vacation until
a specified date.
✦Will I work for my eBay store even when I don’t feel like it? You have
to be prepared for the times when you’re sick or just don’t feel like ship-
ping, but orders are waiting to be shipped. You have to do the work
anyway; it’s all part of the commitment.
eBay gives you the venue, but it’s in your own hands to make your mercan-
tile efforts a success. If you can handle these two responsibilities, read on!
If you’re serious and ready to move on, click the blue Open a Store bar in the
upper-right corner of the page (refer to Figure 6-2). Because you’re always
signed in on your home computer, you’re escorted to a page reminding you
that eBay stores fall under the same User Agreement that you agreed to
when you began selling on eBay. Click the Continue button to access the
Build Your Store pages (see Figure 6-3).
Next, follow these steps:
1. Choose a color theme.
eBay provides some elegant color and graphics themes. Until you have
the time to go hog-wild and design a custom masterpiece, you can choose
one of the 14 clearly organized layouts, either predesigned or with easily
customizable themes. You can always change the color scheme or layout
for your eBay store later. Don’t select something overly bright and vibrant;
you want something that’s easy on the eyes, which is more conducive to
a comfortable selling environment.

Setting Up Shop
710
You have the option of selecting a store theme that doesn’t require you to
insert a custom logo or banner. I highly recommend against it. You need
to establish a unifying brand for your online business.
2. Click Continue.
3. Type your new store’s name (see Figure 6-4).
You’ve decided on a store name, right? Your eBay store name can’t
exceed 35 characters. Before you type it, double-check that you aren’t
infringing on anyone’s copyrights or trademarks. You also can’t use any
permutation of eBay trademarks in your store’s name.
4. Type a short description of your store.
When I say short, I mean short. You have only 300 characters to give a
whiz-bang, electric description of your store and merchandise. You can’t
use HTML coding to doll up the description, and you can’t use links. Just
the facts please, and a little bit of dazzle.
Figure 6-3:
Select a
theme for
your store.

Book VIII
Chapter 6

711
Write your copy ahead of time in Word. Then, still in Word, highlight the
text and choose Tools➪Word Count. Word gives you the word count of
the highlighted text. Check the character count with spaces, to be sure
your text fits.
The description is hugely important. The keyword information you put
here is referenced when someone searches eBay stores and descriptions.
Also, if the store header contains your description (as in the Classic style
themes), search engines such as Google and Yahoo! look in this descrip-
tion for the keywords to classify your merchandise and list your store.
5. Select a graphic to jazz up the look of your store.
You can use one of eBay’s clip-art style banners or create a custom 310 x
90 pixel one. If you use one of eBay’s graphics, you must promise (hand
over heart) that you won’t keep it there for long. (See the text after this
set of steps for info on designing your own graphics — or hiring someone
to do it.)
Now you’re getting somewhere. At this point, your eBay store will look
something like Figure 6-5. You are about to open an eBay storefront.

6. Sign up for the basic store, and click the Start My Subscription Now
button.
Your store is now live on the Internet with nothing up for sale — yet.
7. Click the supplied link to get in the trenches and customize your store
further.
If you’re wondering in which category your store will be listed on the eBay
Stores home page, it’s up to you. eBay checks the items as you list them in
the standard eBay category format. For example, if you have six books listed
in the Books: Fiction and Nonfiction category and five items in the Cameras
& Photo category, you’ll be in the listings for both categories. Your custom
store categories (read on) are used to classify items only in your store.
If you use one of eBay’s prefab graphics, people shopping your eBay store
will know that you aren’t serious enough about your business to design a
simple and basic logo. I’ve had many years of experience in advertising and
marketing and I must tell you that a custom look will beat clip-art any day.
Your store is special — put forth the effort to make it shine.

If you have a graphics program, design a graphic with your store’s name.
Start with something simple; you can always change it later when you have
more time. Save the image as a GIF or JPG file, and upload it to the site where
you host your images (your own Web site, your ISP, or a hosting service).
To get a reasonably priced custom graphic for your eBay store, search eBay
for eBay (banner,banners). (Don’t add a space after the comma.) When I con-
ducted that search, I found 86 Buy It Now listings for people who are willing
to design a custom banner for under $20 — certainly worth the price in the
time you’ll save. Be sure you like the samples of the seller’s designs and are
comfortable with the terms before you buy.
Running Your Store
You can customize your store at any time by clicking the Manage Your Store
link, which is at the bottom of your store’s page and in the upper-right corner
of the eBay Store’s hub page. The page shown in Figure 6-6 appears, with
headings describing important tasks for your store.
Figure 6-6:

Running Your Store
714
Store design and marketing
The Store Editing/Branding list of the Manage Your Store page (refer to
Figure 6-6) has the following links for performing the major tasks required
for your store:
✦Store Builder: You can go back to the Store Builder (the original store
setup area) to change the name of your store or the theme of your pages.
You can also change the way your items are displayed: gallery view
(as in Figure 6-7) or list view (as in Figure 6-8). Neither view is inherently
better, but I like the gallery view because it shows larger thumbnails of
your items.
Figure 6-7:
My eBay
store in
gallery view.
Create an About the Seller page
If you haven’t already created an eBay About Me
page, do it now! The About Me page becomes
the About the Seller page in your store. This
page is a primary tool for promoting sales. (See
Book I, Chapter 8 for more on the About Me
page.) You can put this page together in about
ten minutes, max, with eBay’s handy and easy-
to-use templates!

Book VIII
Chapter 6
Opening Your 
eBay Store
Running Your Store
715
You should also select the order in which your items will sort: highest
priced first, lowest priced first, items ending first, or newly listed first.
I like ending first as my sort, so that buyers can get the chance to swoop
in on items closing soon.
✦Custom pages: Most successful eBay sellers have a store policies page.
Figure 6-9 shows you the one for my store. When you set up a policies
page, eBay supplies you with a choice of layouts. Just click the Create
New Page link to see the template that you want to use, as pictured in
Figure 6-10. Don’t freak out if you don’t know HTML; eBay helps you out
with an easy-to-use HTML generator as in the Sell Your Item form.
Following are some important policies to include:
• Indicate to what locations you’ll ship.
• Specify the sales tax you plan to collect. If your state doesn’t require
you to collect sales tax, leave the area blank. If it does, select your
state and indicate the proper sales tax. Most states won’t require you
to collect sales tax unless the sale is shipped to your home state.
Check the links in Book IX, Chapter 1, to verify your state’s sales tax
regulations.
• State your customer service and return policy. Fill in the information
regarding how you handle refunds, exchanges, and so on. If you’re a
member of SquareTrade (see Chapter 4), mention here that you sub-
scribe to its policies. Be sure to include whatever additional store
information you think is pertinent.

Running Your Store

You can also set up a custom home page for your store, but it’s not a
popular option. It’s best to let your visitors go right to the page listing
what you’re selling, don’t you think?

✦Custom categories: Here’s where you really make your store your own.
You may name up to 19 custom categories that relate to the items you
sell for your store.
✦Custom listing header: Do this. Don’t ask questions, just do it. The
custom listing header display is one of the best tools you can use to
bring people into your store. Click the link and select the option to show
your custom listing header on all your eBay auctions and fixed-price
sales. This will encourage shoppers to visit your eBay store when they
browse your eBay listings.
When customizing, be sure to include your store logo as well as a store
search box. In Figure 6-11, you can see how the store header looks at the
top of an eBay listing.
Promotions
eBay has added some excellent ways to promote your store. As an eBay
store owner, you have access to promotional tools that other sellers can’t
use. The most valuable of these is cross-promotions — and there’s no charge
to use them either! The cross-promotions box appears after a buyer places a
bid on or purchases an item from an eBay seller.
The beauty of having a store is that the cross-promotions box appears twice:
once within your regular listings and again, with a different assortment of
items (if you want), after someone buys an item. Best of all? You get to select
which items are shown with your individual auctions.
Figure 6-12 shows you a cross-promotions box that appears when someone
views one of my auctions.
You can set up the promotions so that they default to show other items from
related store categories, or you can go in and set them up yourself for individ-
ual auctions. Again, every listing has two sets of options: one for when a user
views your listings and the other for when someone bids or wins your item.

718
Making a sale
From the buyer’s point of view, shopping at an eBay store is much different
than winning an auction. eBay stores feature fixed-price sales; the buyer will
get the merchandise as soon as you can ship it (instead of waiting for the
auction to run its course). Even though your auctions show up on your
store’s home page, all regular listings in your eBay store are Buy It Now
items.
When a buyer makes a purchase from an eBay store, here’s what happens:
1. The buyer clicks the Buy It Now button on the listing page. The Review
Payments page appears, where the buyer can review the purchase. This
page contains the shipping amount that you specified when you listed
the item.
2. The buyer provides shipping information (required). When eBay notifies
you that a sale has been made, you have all the information you need.
You don’t have to scurry around looking for the return address on the
envelope when the payment arrives.
3. The buyer reviews the transaction and then clicks the Confirm button.
The information about the sale is e-mailed to you, and the buyer receives
confirmation of the sale.
Your eBay store is an essential backup to your auctions. It’s a great place to
put out-of-season items, accessories for the items you sell actively, and even
consignment items between relisting. Considering the price of an eBay store,
you have to make only a few sales per month to pay for it. And when your
sales start to build, your efforts will be greatly rewarded!

 Choosing a legal business format
I
f you’ve played around on eBay, had some fun, and made a few dollars,
good for you — enjoy yourself! Once you start making serious money,
however, your business is no longer a hobby. It’s time to consider some
issues such as business structure, tax planning, and licenses.
When you’re concentrating on fulfilling multiple orders and keeping your
customers happy, the last thing you need is a G-man breathing down your
neck. Worst case scenario: How about getting audited in December when
you haven’t been keeping good records all year? I know this sounds like
stripping the fun out of doing business on eBay, but taking a bit of time and
effort now can save you a ton of trouble later on (and will save you money
in penalties).
Giving Your Business an Official Name
In most states in the U.S., you can find funny liner ads in the classified section
of the local newspaper. They’re called fictitious name statements, and they
need to be registered with your state before you can open a bank account in
a business’s name. They let the state know who owns and operates a busi-
ness. In California, you must file a fictitious name statement within 40 days
of the commencement of your business. (Other state laws vary, so check
the Web sites listed later in this chapter for more information on your state’s
requirements.) Your statement must also include a physical address where
the business is operated — not a post office box address.
Before you assume that registering a name isn’t required in your state, check
with your state’s business code. (Links to all 50 states are presented later
in the chapter.) Some states, such as Indiana, require that you register the
assumed name of your business with the Secretary of State.

Taking Care of Regulatory Details
722
In the states requiring publication, your fictitious name statement must be
published in an adjudicated (officially approved) newspaper for a certain
amount of time. Ostensibly, this is to let the community know that a busi-
ness is starting and who owns it. The newspaper supplies you with a proof
of publication, which you keep in your files as a record of your filing. You
generally have to renew the statement after a prescribed number of years.
After you have your officially stamped proof of publication, you can bring
that to the bank and open an account in your business name, which is
an important step in separating your personal living expenses from the 
business.
Taking Care of Regulatory Details
Let me give you some important advice to make your life easier in the long
run: Don’t ignore city, county, state, and federal regulatory details. Doing so
may make life easier at the get-go, but if your business is successful, one day
your casual attitude will catch up with you. Ignorance is no excuse. You must
comply with all the rules and regulations that are set up for your protection
and benefit.
Business license or city tax certificate
Business licenses are the official-looking pieces of paper you see behind the
register at brick-and-mortar businesses. Every business must have one, and
depending on your local laws, you may have to have a city license or a city
tax registration certificate. Yes, even if you’re running a business out of your
home and have no one coming to do business at your home, you may still
need this. If you don’t have one, the authorities may charge you a bunch of
penalties if they ever find out. Avoiding this step isn’t worth the risk.
Don’t waste your money!
All kinds of expensive services on the Internet
are more than willing to handle the work for you
for a fat fee. Don’t waste your money. If news-
paper publication is required, look in the phone
book for a small community newspaper and call
them to see whether they handle this type of legal
ad. Most small newspapers are 90% supported
by the money they make on filing legal ads.
They’re the experts on this type of filing. Plus,
you get to help out another small business in your
community. Every 5 years, I file my company’s
DBA (Doing Business As) with the nice gray-
haired lady at the local newspaper office.

State sales tax number
If your state has a sales tax, a sales tax number (the number you use when you
file your sales tax statement with your state) is required before you officially

and the Feds

sell anything. If sales tax applies, you may have to collect the appropriate
sales tax for every sale that ships within the state that your business is in.
Some people also call this a resale certificate because when you want to 
purchase goods from a wholesaler within your state, you must produce
this number (thereby certifying your legitimacy as a seller) so that the
dealer can sell you the merchandise without charging you sales tax.
To find the regulations for your state, try a couple of terrific sites that supply
links to every state’s tax board, which should have the answers to your
questions:
✦www.mtc.gov/txpyrsvs/actualpage.htm
✦www.taxadmin.org/fta/link/forms.html
Don’t withhold the withholding forms
If you’re going to be paying anyone a salary, you’ll need an employer identifi-
cation number (EIN), also known as a Federal tax identification number. Every
business has one. It’s like a social security number for a business, identifying
your business on all government forms: a nine-digit number assigned to all
businesses for tax filing and reporting. You may also need one for your state.
If you have regular employees, you need to file withholding forms to collect
the necessary taxes that you must send to the state and the IRS on behalf of
your employees. You’re also expected to deposit those tax dollars with the
IRS and your state on the date required, which may vary from business to
business. Many enterprises go down because the owners just can’t seem to
keep their fingers out of withheld taxes, which mean the money isn’t available
to turn in when the taxes are due. (This is another reason why you should
have a separate bank account for your business.)
No need to dawdle. Why not get the number while you have the time:
✦There’s no charge to get your employer ID number (EIN).
✦An employer ID number can be assigned by filing IRS form SS-4. Go to
the IRS Web site at the following to apply online:
www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=102767,00.html
Or if you’d rather mail in the form, the details and downloadable form
are available as a PDF file.
✦State employer ID numbers for taxes may depend on your state’s require-
ments. Visit the following for an overview of the requirements for every
state in the country:
www.taxadmin.org/fta/forms.ssi

Selecting a Business Format
726
Selecting a Business Format
After you’ve fulfilled all the regulatory details, you need to formally decide
how you want to run your company. You need to set up a legal format and
you need to make a merchandise plan. (For more on merchandise planning,
visit Book IV, Chapter 2.)
When you have a business, any type of business, it has to have a legal format
for licensing and tax purposes. Businesses come in several forms, from a
sole proprietorship all the way to a corporation. A corporation designation
isn’t as scary as it sounds. Yes, Microsoft, IBM, and eBay are corporations,
but so too are many individually run businesses.
Each form of business has its plusses and minuses — and costs. I go over
some of the fees involved in incorporating later in this chapter. For now,
I detail the most common types of businesses, which I encourage you to
weigh carefully.
I’m not a lawyer, so be sure to consult with a professional in the legal and
financial fields to get the latest legal and tax ramifications of the various
business formats.
Sole proprietorship
If you’re running your business by yourself part-time or full-time, your business
is a sole proprietorship. Yep, doesn’t that sound official? A sole proprietor-
ship is the simplest form of business; you don’t need a lawyer to set it up.
Nothing is easier or cheaper. Most people use this form of business when
they’re starting out. Many people often graduate to a more formal type of
business as things get bigger.
If a husband and wife file a joint tax return, they can run a business as a
sole proprietorship (but only one of you can be the proprietor). However,
if both you and your spouse work equally in the business, running it as a
partnership — with a written partnership agreement — is a much better
idea. (See the next section, “Partnership,” for more information.) A partner-
ship protects you in case of your partner’s death. In a sole proprietorship, the
business ends with the death of the proprietor. If the business has been a sole
proprietorship in your late spouse’s name, you may be left out in the cold.
Being in business adds a few expenses, but many things that you spend money
on now (relating to your business) can be deducted from your state and federal
taxes. A sole proprietorship can be run out of your personal checking account
(although I don’t advise it). The profits of your business are taxed directly as
part of your own income tax, and the profits and expenses are reported on

Book IX
Chapter 1
Getting Legal 
with the State 
and the Feds
Selecting a Business Format
727
Schedule C of your 1040 tax package. As a sole proprietor, you’re at risk for
the business liabilities. All outstanding debts are yours, and you could lose
personal assets if you default. Also, as your business becomes profitable,
this business format forces you to pay an additional self-employment tax.
Also, you must consider the liability of the products you sell on eBay. If you
sell foodstuffs, vitamins, or neutraceuticals (new-age food supplements) that
make someone ill, you may be personally liable for any court-awarded dam-
ages. If someone is hurt by something you sell, you may also be personally
liable as the seller of the product.
In a sole proprietorship, as with any form of home-based business, you may
be able to get an insurance rider to your homeowners insurance policy to
cover you against some liabilities. Check with your insurance agent.
Partnership
When two or more people are involved in a business, it can be a partnership.
A general partnership can be formed by an oral agreement. Each person in
the partnership contributes capital or services and both share in the part-
nership’s profits and losses. The income of a partnership is taxed to both
partners, based on the percentage of the business that they own or upon
the terms of a written agreement. Any losses are also split. The partnership
must file its own tax return (Form 1065) reporting the business financials to
the IRS.
You’d better be sure that you can have a good working relationship with your
partner: This type of business relationship has broken up many a friendship.
Writing up a formal agreement when forming your eBay business partner-
ship is an excellent idea. This agreement is useful in solving any disputes
that may occur over time.
In your agreement, be sure to outline things such as
✦How to divide the profits and losses
✦Compensation to each partner
✦Duties and responsibilities of each partner
✦Restrictions of authority and spending
✦How disputes should be settled
✦What happens if the partnership dissolves
✦What happens to the partnership in case of death or disability

Selecting a Business Format
728
One more important thing to remember: As a partner, you’re jointly and sev-
erally responsible for the business liabilities and actions of the other person
or people in your partnership — as well as your own. Again, this is a personal
liability arrangement. You are both personally open to any lawsuits that come
your way through the business.
The partnership has to file an informational return with the IRS and the
state, but the profits of the partnership are taxed to the partners on their
personal individual returns.
LLC (Limited Liability Company)
A limited liability company, or LLC, is similar to a partnership but also has
many of the characteristics of a corporation. An LLC differs from a partner-
ship mainly in that the liabilities of the company are not passed on to the
members (owners). Unless you sign a personal guarantee for debt incurred,
the members are responsible only to the total amount they have invested
into the company. But all members do have liability for the company’s taxes.
You’ll need to put together an operating agreement, similar to the partnership
agreement. This also will help establish which members own what percentage
of the company for tax purposes. Most states will require you to file Articles
of Organization forms to start this type of business.
Getting legal documents prepared online
You just knew legal services would go online
eventually, didn’t you? If you’re thinking of set-
ting up one of the business formats described in
this chapter, you might be interested in putting
things together online. Real lawyers are there
to help you at www.legalzoom.com. They
handle legal document preparation for busi-
ness incorporation, partnerships, and more for
low prices. This online venture was developed
by a group of experienced attorneys, co-founded
by Robert Shapiro (yes, that Robert Shapiro —
of O.J. fame).
They feature an amazing online law library that
can answer many of your questions and help
you make informed decisions. Documents are
prepared according to how you answer online
questionnaires. LegalZoom checks your work,
and e-mails your documents or mails them
printed on quality acid-free paper for your sig-
nature.
LegalZoom handled the trademark for my name,
and I couldn’t believe how easy the process
was. They had step-by-step instructions and
FAQs to handle my silliest of questions. I got my
paperwork quickly and the entire process was
not only inexpensive but painless. You may
want to also at least do a phone consultation
with an attorney in your area, perhaps one who
is a member of the local Chamber of Commerce.

An LLC is taxed like a sole proprietorship, with the profits and losses passed
on to the members’ personal tax returns. An LLC may opt to pay taxes like a
corporation and keep some of the profits in the company, thereby reducing
the tax burden to individual members. Although members pay the LLC’s
taxes, the LLC must still file Form 1065 with the IRS at the end of the year.
This gives the IRS extra data to be sure that the individual members prop-
erly report their income.
Some states levy additional special or minimum taxes on an LLC. Be sure to
check with your state’s business department.
C-corporation
A corporation has a life of its own: its own name, its own bank account, and
its own tax return. A corporation is a legal entity created for the sole pur-
pose of doing business. One of the main problems a sole proprietor faces
when incorporating is realizing that he or she can’t help themselves to the
assets of the business. Yes, a corporation can have only one owner: the
shareholder(s). If you can’t understand that you can’t write yourself a check
from your corporation, unless it’s for salary or for reimbursement of legiti-
mate expenses, you may not be able to face the responsibility of running
your own corporation.
The state in which you run your business sets up the rules for the corpora-
tions operating within its borders. You must apply to the Secretary of State
of the state in which you want to incorporate. Federal taxes for corporations
presently range from 15 to 35% (see Table 1-2), and they’re generally based
on your net profits.

Employee owners of corporations can use the company to shelter income
from being taxed by dividing the income between their personal and corpo-
rate tax returns. This is frequently called income splitting and involves setting
salaries and bonuses so that any profits left in the company at the end of its
tax year will be taxed at only the 15% rate.
It’s kind of fun to compare what you pay and how much you’d pay in taxes if
you left profits in a small corporation, so check out Table 1-2 for the rates.
Considering that the individual Federal tax rate percentages for incomes up
to $75,000 annually go as high as 30.5%, the trouble of keeping a corporation
for your business may be a huge money saver.
Many states also have their own taxes for corporations. To get an idea of the
rates in your state, check the following:
www.taxfoundation.org/corporateincometaxrates.html
Often in small corporations, most of the profits are paid out in tax-deductible
salaries and benefits. The most important benefit for a business is that any
liabilities belong to the corporation. Your personal assets remain your own,
because they have no part in the corporation.

ookkeeping, bah! You’ll get no argument from me that bookkeeping can
be the most boring and time-consuming part of your job. You may feel
that you just need to add your product costs, add your gross sales, and
bada-bing, you know where your business is. Sorry, not true. Did you add
that roll of tape you picked up at the supermarket today? Although it cost
only $1.29, it’s a business expense. How about the mileage driving back and
forth from garage sales and flea markets? Those are expenses, too. I suspect
that you’re not counting quite a few other “small” items just like these in
your expense column.
I must confess that I enjoy posting my expenses and sales after I actually get
into the task. It gives me the opportunity to know exactly where my business
is at any given moment. Of course, I’m not using a pencil-entered ledger
system; I use a software program that’s easy and fun. In this chapter, I give
you the lowdown on the basics of bookkeeping and emphasize the impor-
tance of keeping records in case Uncle Sam comes calling. Keep reading:

Dealing with a Professional
Have you ever wondered why big businesses have CFOs (chief financial 
officers), vice presidents of finance, CPAs (certified public accountants),
and bookkeepers? It’s because keeping the books is the backbone of a com-
pany’s business.

Dealing with a Professional
732
Do you have a professional going over your books at least once a year? You
should. A paid professional experienced in business knows what to do when
it comes to your taxes. Due to the complexity of the tax code, not just any
paid preparer will suffice when it comes to preparing your business taxes.
Here’s a list of possible people who can prepare your tax returns.
✦Tax preparer (or consultant): This is the person you visit at the local
we-file-for-you tax office. Did you know that a tax preparer could be 
anybody? There is no licensing involved. H&R Block hires as many as
100,000 seasonal workers as tax preparers each year. Where do these
people come from? I’m sure that some are experts on the tax code, but
the sheer number of tax preparers and the lack of regulation can make
using a we-file-for-you tax office a risky proposition for business people
who want to minimize their tax liability.
A United States General Accounting Office report estimated that, in 1998,
American citizens overpaid their taxes by $945 million because they
claimed the standard deduction when it would have been more benefi-
cial to itemize. Half of those taxpayers used a paid preparer who clearly
was not cognizant of the full tax law as it applied to the individuals.
Scary, huh?
✦Volunteer IRS-certified preparers: The AARP (American Association of
Retired Persons) does an outstanding job of assembling nearly 32,000 tax
preparers to serve the needs of low- to middle-income taxpayers (special
attention going to seniors). Their goal is to maximize legal deductions
and credits, resulting in “tangible economic benefits” for their clients.
These volunteers have to study, take a test, and become certified by the
IRS before they can lend their services to the cause.
In 2003, AARP volunteers served a total of 1.85 million seniors in the
United States. My mother was a retired corporate comptroller, and she
volunteered in this program for many years. (She was disappointed
when she made her lowest score on the IRS test — a 94%!) They staff
more than 8500 sites around the United States. To find the one near you,
call 1-888-AARP-NOW (1-888-227-7669) and select Tax-Aide Information.
✦Public accountant: A public accountant, or PA, must fulfill educational,
testing, and experience requirements and obtain a state license. PAs
must take an annual course to maintain their status.
✦Enrolled agent: Often called one of the best kept secrets in accounting, an
enrolled agent is Federally licensed by the IRS. (CPAs and attorneys are
licensed by the state.) EAs must pass an extensive annual test on tax law
preparation every year to maintain their status. (They also have to pass
annual background checks.) Enrolled agents are authorized to appear in
place of a taxpayer before the IRS.

Book IX
Chapter 2

and Business
Reporting
Keeping the Books: Basics to Get You Started
733
Many EAs are former IRS employees. To find an enrolled agent near you,
go to the www.naea.org Web site and enter the Taxpayer’s area.
✦Certified public accountant: Certified public accountants (CPAs) must
complete rigorous testing and fulfill experience requirements as pre-
scribed by the state in which they practice. Most states require a CPA
to obtain a state license.
CPAs are accountants. They specialize in record-keeping and reporting
financial matters. Their important position is as an advisor regarding
financial decisions for both individuals and businesses. CPAs must take
an annual course to maintain their status.
Keeping the Books: Basics to Get You Started
Although posting bookkeeping entries can be boring, clicking a button to
generate your tax information is a lot easier than manually going over pages
of sales information on a pad of paper. That’s why I like to use a software
program, particularly QuickBooks (more about that program later).
I suppose that you could use plain ol’ paper and a pencil to keep your books;
if that works for you, great. But even though that might work for you now, it
definitely won’t in the future. Entering all your information into a software
program now — while your books may still be fairly simple to handle — can
save you a lot of time and frustration in the future, when your eBay business
has grown beyond your wildest dreams and no amount of paper can keep it
all straight and organized. I discuss alternative methods of bookkeeping in
Chapter 3. For now, I focus on the basics of bookkeeping.
To effectively manage your business, you must keep track of all your
expenses — down to the last roll of tape. You need to keep track of your
inventory, how much you paid for the items, how much you paid in shipping,
and how much you profited from your sales. If you use a van or the family
car to pick up or deliver merchandise to the post office (I can load eight of
the light kits that I sell on eBay in our car), you should keep track of this
mileage as well. When you’re running a business, you should account for
every penny that goes in and out.
Bookkeeping has irrefutable standards called GAAP (Generally Accepted
Accounting Procedures) that are set by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board. (It sounds scary to me too.) Assets, liabilities, owner’s equity, income,
and expenses are standard terms used in all forms of accounting to define
profit, loss, and the fiscal health of your business.

734
Every time you process a transaction, two things happen: One account is
credited while another receives a debit (kind of like yin and yang). To get more
familiar with these terms (and those in the following list), see the definitions
in the chart of accounts in Chapter 3. Depending on the type of account, the
account’s balance either increases or decreases. One account that increases
while another decreases is called double-entry accounting:
✦When you post an expense, the debit increases your expenses and
decreases your bank account.
✦When you purchase furniture or other assets, it increases your asset
account and decreases your bank account.
✦When you make a sale and make the deposit, it increases your bank
account and decreases your accounts receivable.
✦When you purchase inventory, it increases your inventory and decreases
your bank account.
✦When a portion of a sale includes sales tax, it decreases your sales and
increases your sales tax account.
Manually performing double-entry accounting can be a bit taxing (no pun
intended). A software program, however, will automatically adjust the
accounts when you input a transaction. 
As a business owner, even if you’re a sole proprietor (see Chapter 1 for infor-
mation on business types), you should keep your business books separate
from your personal expenses. (I recommend using a program such as Quicken
to keep track of your personal expenses for tax time.) By isolating your busi-
ness records from your personal records, you can get a snapshot of which
areas of your sales are doing well and which ones aren’t carrying their
weight. But that isn’t the only reason keeping accurate records is smart;
there’s the IRS to think about, too. In the next section, I explain Uncle Sam’s
interest in your books.
Posting bookkeeping can be boring. At the end of the year when you have a
professional do your taxes, however, you’ll be a lot happier — and your tax
preparation will cost you less — if you’ve posted your information cleanly
and in the proper order. That’s why using QuickBooks (see Chapter 3) is
essential to running your business.

get started with your business, the IRS maintains a small-business Web site
(shown in Figure 2-1) at the following address:
www.irs.gov/businesses/small
In this section, I highlight what information you need to keep and how long
you should keep it (just in case you’re chosen for an audit).
Supporting information
Aside from needing to know how your business is going (which is really
important), the main reason to keep clear and concise records is because
Uncle Sam may come knocking one day. You never know when the IRS will
choose your number and want to examine your records. In the following list,
I highlight some of the important pieces of supporting information (things
that support your expenses on your end-of-year tax return):
✦Receipts: Dear reader, heed this advice: Save every receipt that you get. If
you’re out of town on a buying trip and have coffee at the airport, save that
receipt — it’s a deduction from your profits. Everything related to your
business may be deductible, so you must save airport parking receipts,
taxi receipts, receipts for a pen that you picked up on your way to a meet-
ing, everything. If you don’t have a receipt, you can’t prove the write-off.
Figure 2-1:
IRS home
page for
small
businesses.

Records Uncle Sam May Want to See
736
✦Merchandise invoices: Saving all merchandise invoices is as important as
saving all your receipts. If you want to prove that you paid $400 and not
the $299 retail price for that PlayStation 2 that you sold on eBay for $500,
you’d better have an invoice of some kind. The same idea applies to most
collectibles, in which case a retail price can’t be fixed. Save all invoices!
✦Outside contractor invoices: If you use outside contractors — even if
you pay the college kid next door to go to the post office and the bank
for you — you should get an invoice from them to document exactly
what service you paid for and how much you paid. This is supporting
information that will save your bacon, should it ever need saving.
✦Business cards: It may sound like I’m stretching things a bit, but if you
use your car to look at some merchandise, pick up a business card from
the vendor. If you’re out of town and have a meeting with someone, take
a card. Having these business cards can help substantiate your deductible
comings and goings.
✦A daily calendar: This is where your Palm handheld comes in. Every
time you leave your house or office on a business-related task, make
note of it in your Palm. Keep as much minutia as you can stand. Your
Palm desktop can print a monthly calendar. At the end of the year, staple
the pages together and include them in your files with your substantiat-
ing information.
✦Credit card statements: You’re already collecting credit card receipts
(although mine always seem to slip through the holes in my purse). If
you have your statements, you have a monthly proof of expenses. When
you get your statement each month, post it into your bookkeeping pro-
gram and itemize each and every charge, detailing where you spent the
money and what for. (QuickBooks has a split feature that accommodates
all your categories.) File these statements with your tax return at the
end of the year in your year-end envelope (shoe box?).
I know that all this stuff will pile up, but that’s when you go to the store and
buy some plastic file-storage containers to organize it all. To check for new
information and the lowdown on what you can and can’t do, ask an account-
ant or a CPA. Also visit the IRS Tax Information for Businesses site, shown in
Figure 2-2, at
www.irs.ustreas.gov/businesses
How long should you keep your records?
How long do you have to keep all this supporting information? I hate to tell
you, but I think I’ve saved it all. I must have at least ten years of paperwork
in big plastic boxes and old files in the garage. But you know, I’m not too
extreme; the period in which you can amend a return or in which the IRS can
assess more tax is never less than three years from the date of filing — and
can be even longer.

Even though I got the information in Table 2-1 directly from the IRS Web site
and literature (Publication 583, “Starting a Business and Keeping Records”),
it may change in the future. You can download a PDF copy of the booklet by
going to the following address:
www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p583.pdf
If Adobe Acrobat Reader isn’t installed on your computer, you can download
the software (it’s free) from the IRS Web site. It doesn’t hurt to store your
information for as long as you can stand it and stay on top of any changes
the IRS may implement.
Getting the Most from Your Reports
After you’re up and running with your eBay business, you can look forward
to having lots of reports to evaluate. Of course, you get a plethora of reports
from PayPal, eBay, and so on, but the most important reports are those you
generate from your bookkeeping program (software such as QuickBooks).
I use the QuickBooks software package to manage my business records, and
it keeps several common reports (Balance Sheet, Accounts Payable, P&L,
and so on) in an easily accessible area. If you check out the reports tab of
your bookkeeping program, I bet you’ll find similar items. Before your eyes
glaze over, though, check out this section for straightforward descriptions of
these reports and the information they provide.
Similar sales and financial reports are common to all businesses, and review-
ing them on a monthly basis can help you stay on top of yours. 
To get your business reports when you need them, you must post your sales
receipts regularly and thereby update the money in and the inventory out.
Post your payments at least weekly (especially on your company credit 
card — post those transactions the minute you make purchases) and 
reconcile your checkbook the moment your bank statement arrives.
What do your posting and reconciling tasks get you? The opportunity to press
a button and get a complete picture of your business. From the reports you
generate, you find out whether your business is profitable, what products
are selling, and if you’re spending too much money in a particular area.
Keeping your books up-to-date allows you to find problems before they
become unmanageable.
If you run your sales and financial reports quarterly rather than monthly, a
problem — such as not pricing your items high enough — could be mush-
rooming out of control.

Understanding the balance sheet
Your balance sheet provides the best information on your business. It pulls
data from all the other reports and gives you a complete look at the financial
condition of your business.
Your balance sheet shows all your assets:
✦Cash in bank: The money in your business bank account.
✦Accounts receivable: If you’ve invoiced anyone and not received pay-
ment as yet, that amount is reflected here.
✦Inventory assets: This is the value of the merchandise you’ve purchased
for resale but have not as yet sold.
✦Other assets: Things your business (not you) owns, such as furniture
and vehicles. These are not considered in the current asset figure.
✦Accumulated depreciation: This is deprecation on your assets, either pro-
duced by your accounting program or given to you by your accountant.
Your balance sheet also shows your liabilities:
✦Accounts payable: Money you owe vendors and money due on unpaid
credit cards show up here.
✦Sales tax: The money you’ve collected on sales tax (that is due to your
state) is a liability.
✦Payroll liabilities: If you haven’t made a bank deposit covering the money
you’ve withdrawn from employees (withholding taxes, Social Security,
Medicare, and so on), it shows up here.
Your equity shows up in the (literal and figurative) bottom line. It will include
the initial investment in your business and the net income total from your
profit & loss statement.
An important business ratio — the net working capital ratio — is drawn from
your balance sheet. Subtracting your current liabilities from your current
assets gets you the dollar amount of your net working capital. But to get the
net working capital ratio, divide your current assets by your current liabili-
ties. Any value over 1.1 means you have a positive net working capital. If you
need a loan from a bank, this is the first figure the loan office will look for.
Tracking your accounts payable
When bills come in, post them in your accounting program. This will gener-
ate the accounts payable report. Accounts payable is the area that shows
how much you owe and when it’s due. This is crucial information for meeting
your obligations on time.

Getting the Most from Your Reports
740
When you pay an outstanding bill, the bookkeeping program deducts the
money from your checking account and marks the bill as paid. It will no
longer appear on this report.
Knowing your sales tax liability
One of the vendors you’ll owe money to is your state. In California, it’s the
State Board of Equalization. Every time you post an invoice or sales receipt
that charges sales tax, that amount shows up in the sales tax liability report.
You run this report on a timeframe determined by the state; you may be
required to report monthly, quarterly, or yearly. Also, how often you report
may depend on your total in-state sales. Just make sure you match your
reporting with your state’s requirements.
Analyzing your profit and loss statement
If your accountant asks for your income statement, he or she is asking for
your profit and loss statement, or P&L. This report lays out clearly every
penny you’ve spent and brought in. You can set these reports to generate by
any period of time; usually eBay sellers produce them by calendar month.
A summary P&L itemizes all your income and expense accounts individually
and totals them by category. This way, you’ll be able to isolate individual areas
where you may notice a problem, such as spending too much in shipping
supplies.
Please use the following list of income and expense accounts as a guide and
not as gospel. I am not a tax professional, and I suggest that when you set up
your own income and (especially) expense accounts, you go over them with
a licensed tax expert. Here’s a glimpse at the kind of accounts and categories
you see on a P&L statement:
✦Income: Every dollar you bring in is itemized as income. For many sell-
ers, this can break down into several individual accounts. These figures
are automatically generated by your bookkeeping program from the sales
receipts you input. The total of all these income areas is subtotaled at
the bottom of this area as total income.
• Sales: This totals eBay sales and shipping income in separate totals.
These figures subtotal as total sales.
• Web site advertising: If you’re a member of any affiliate programs or
have a newsletter that takes advertising, this income posts here.
• Consulting: Income from consulting or teaching others.

Chapter 2
The Joys of Taxes
and Business
Reporting
Getting the Most from Your Reports
741
✦Cost of goods sold (COGS): This area itemizes by category all the costs
involved in your eBay (and Web site) sales only. None of your business
operating expenses, such as your telephone bill, show up here; they’re
farther down on the report. Your eBay COGS may subtotal in different
accounts, such as
• Merchandise: The cost of merchandise that you bought to resell.
• eBay fees: Here’s where you post your eBay fees from your credit
card statement.
• PayPal fees: This figure is automatically generated from your sales
receipts.
• Shipping postage: The totals of the amounts you spend for shipping
your eBay items.
• Shipping supplies: The costs of padded mailers, bubble wrap, tape,
and boxes. When those items are paid for, the bookkeeping program
inserts the totals here.
• Outside service fees: If you pay for photo hosting or third-party
management tools, they appear here.
Cross-reference your cost of goods sold to your sales reports. You’ve
expensed inventory bought, but your merchandise may be sitting idle
in your storage area. The COGS report works with other reports, such
as inventory reports (also generated by QuickBooks), sales reports,
and P&Ls, to give you a solid picture of where your business is going.
Your cost of goods sold is subtotaled under the heading total COGS.
✦Gross profit: Your bookkeeping program magically does all the calcula-
tions and you’ll be able to see in a snapshot whether your eBay business
is in good, profitable health. This is the gross profit before you figure in
your company expenses (often called G&A, for general and administra-
tive costs).
Now come your expenses. Listed in individual accounts, you have subtotals
for your various business operating expenses, as follows:
✦Payroll expenses: The total amounts you pay your employees.
✦Taxes: Broken out by state and federal, the taxes you’ve paid to the regu-
lating agencies for running your business.
✦Supplies: Computer and office supplies. How much paper goes through
your printer? Not to mention those inkjet cartridges, pens, computers, tele-
phones, copiers, and network equipment. All those expenses appear here.

Keeping Your Records and Data Safe
742
✦Seminars and education: Did you buy this book to educate yourself on
your eBay business? It counts. Have you attended a seminar to educate
yourself on eBay? Going to eBay Live? Those count too.
✦Contract labor: This is the money you pay to anyone who is not an
employee of your company, such as an off-site bookkeeper or a company
that comes in to clean your office. The federal government has stringent
rules as to who classifies as an independent contractor. Check this Web
site for the official rules:
www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=115041,00.html
✦Automobile expenses: This is where you post expenses, such as park-
ing, gas, and repairs for an automobile used for your eBay business. If
you have only one vehicle that you also use for personal transportation,
your tax person may have you post a percentage of its use in this area.
✦Telephone: Do you have a separate phone line for your business?
✦Advertising: Expenses you incur when running advertising campaigns,
such as in Google AdWords or in your eBay banner program.
Your expenses will come to a whopping total at the bottom. Then, at the
very bottom of the page, will be your net income. This is your bottom-line
profit. I wish you all a very positive bottom line!
Keeping Your Records and Data Safe
If the hazard of not backing up your computer isn’t a tired subject, I don’t
know what is. Whenever you hear someone talking about their latest com-
puter crash, all the person can do is stare blankly into the distance and say,
“I lost everything!” I admit, it’s happened to me, and I’m sure that you’ve heard
this cry from others (if you’ve not uttered it yourself): “If only I’d backed up
my files!”
What about a natural disaster? It can happen, you know. When I went to
sleep on January 16, 1994, I didn’t know that the next day, when I attempted
to enter my office, everything would be in shambles. My monitors had flown
across the room, filing cabinets turned over, and oh, did I mention the ceiling
had collapsed? The Northridge earthquake taught me some solid lessons
about keeping duplicate records and backed-up data copies in an offsite
location. 
If a computer crash or natural disaster has happened to you, you have my
deepest and most sincere sympathy. It’s a horrible thing to go through.

Book IX
Chapter 2
The Joys of Taxes
and Business
Reporting
Keeping Your Records and Data Safe
743
What’s another horrible thing? A tax audit: It can make you feel like jumping
off a cliff if you’ve been filing your hard documentation with the shoebox
method. (You know, one box for 2005, one for 2004, and so on.) Filing your
receipts and backup documentation in an organized easy-to-find format can
pay off in future savings of time (and nerves). 
I want to tell you up front that I don’t always practice what I preach. I don’t
always back up my stuff on time. I have a new box of backup software sitting
on the floor next to me, and the box of receipts is getting fuller. But I’m gonna
preach anyway about good practices for backing up your computer data and
safeguarding the hardcopy documents that you inevitably will have. (I just
really hope there are no disasters before I finish writing this book!)
Taking the time to organize and safeguard your data and records now may
save you days, weeks, or months of work and frustration later.
Backing up your data
I’m not specifically suggesting that you go out and buy backup software
(though I think it’s a good idea). I am suggesting that you back up the eBay
transaction records and other data on your computer somehow. Consider
the following points when choosing how to back up the data you can’t afford
to lose:
✦Regularly back up at least your My Documents folder onto a CD. CD burn-
ers have come way down in price (you can find external USB burners in
good condition for under $50 on eBay), so there’s really no excuse not to
make some sort of backup.
✦Backup software can make your backup chores less chorelike. Most pack-
ages enable you to run backups unattended and automatically, so you
don’t have to remember anything.
✦Backup software doesn’t have to be expensive. I just visited one of my
favorite shareware sites, www.tucows.com, and searched the term backup
Windows. This query returned more than 300 matching records!
There’s no need for me to recommend a particular brand of backup soft-
ware; almost any brand you buy will do a good job. When you search
tucows or Amazon, read the customer comments and let these help direct
you to the software that’s right for you.
✦Consider making monthly backups of the info from your PayPal account.
You can download the data directly from the site and can archive several
years’ worth on one CD.

Keeping Your Records and Data Safe
744
Saving your backup paperwork
Business records are still mostly paper, and until such time as the entire world
is electronic, you’ll have some paperwork to store. You can buy manila file
folders almost anywhere. A box of 100 costs less than $10, so expense is no
excuse for lack of organization. If you don’t have filing cabinets, office supply
stores sell collapsible cardboard boxes that are the perfect size to hold file
folders. You can buy six of these for around $8.
And just what do you need to file in your new organized office? Here are a
few important suggestions:
✦Equipment receipts and warranties: You never know when some impor-
tant piece of your office hardware will go on the fritz, and you’ll need the
receipt and warranty information so you can get it fixed. Also, the receipts
are backup documentation for your bookkeeping program’s data.
✦Automobile expenses: Gasoline receipts, parking receipts, repairs —
anything and everything to do with your car. You use your car in your eBay
business (for example, to deliver packages to the post office for shipping),
don’t you?
✦Postal receipts: Little slips of paper that you get from the post office. If
you use an online postage service, print a postage report once a month
and file it in your filing cabinets or boxes as well.
✦Credit card bills: Here in one location can be documentation on your
purchases for your business. Make a folder for each credit card and file
every month after you pay the bill and post the data.
✦Merchandise receipts: Merchandise purchased for resale on eBay.
Documentation of all the money you spend.
✦Licenses and legal stuff: Important! Keep an active file of anything legal;
you will no doubt have to lay hands on this information at the oddest
moment. It’s reassuring to know where it is!
✦Payroll paperwork: Even if you print your checks and such on the com-
puter, you should organize state and federal filing information in one place.
✦Canceled checks and bank statements: The only ways to prove you’ve
paid for something.
✦Insurance information: Policies and insurance proposals should all be
kept close by.
I’m sure you can think of some more things that can benefit by a little bit of
organization. When you need the information quickly, and you can find it
without breaking a sweat, you’ll be glad you kept things organized.

Chapter 3: Using Bookkeeping
Software
In This Chapter
 Using QuickBooks for your bookkeeping needs
 Using QuickBooks efficiently
W
hen you meet with one of the professionals described in Chapter 2,
you’ll need to bring a complete and accurate set of books. To prepare
accurate books, you can use a bookkeeper (who will use accounting software)
or you can learn how to use professional accounting software yourself. Don’t
be a wussy; you can do this. Lots of people successfully using bookkeeping
software today knew nothing about bookkeeping before they set up their
own accounts. I’m one of them.
When your business gets so busy that you have no time to post your book-
keeping, you can always hire a part-time bookkeeper to come in and do your
posting for you. I found mine on elance.com. We fax and e-mail data every
month.
I researched various Web sites to find which software was the best selling and
easiest to use. I had many discussions with CPAs, enrolled agents, and book-
keepers. The software that these professionals most recommend for business
is Intuit’s QuickBooks. (Thank goodness that’s the one I use.) QuickBooks is
considered the best, which is why I devote so much of this chapter to it. Some
people begin with Quicken and later move to QuickBooks when their business
gets big or incorporates. My theory? Start with the best. It’s not that much
more expensive; on eBay, I’ve seen new, sealed QuickBooks Pro 2004 software
for as low as $135 and QuickBooks for as low as $65.
QuickBooks: Making Bookkeeping Uncomplicated
QuickBooks offers several versions, from basic to enterprise solutions tailored
to different types of businesses. QuickBooks Basic and QuickBooks Pro have
a few significant differences. QuickBooks Pro adds job costing and expensing
features and the ability to design your own forms. QuickBooks Basic does a

746
darn good job too, so check out the comparison at quickbooks.intuit.
com and see which version is best for you. I use (and highly recommend)
QuickBooks Pro, so that’s the version I describe in the rest of this section.
Stephen L. Nelson wrote QuickBooks 2004 For Dummies (published by Wiley).
His book is amazingly easy to understand. I swear that neither Steve nor
my publisher gave me a nickel for recommending his book. (Heck, I even had
to pay for my copy.) I recommend it simply because it answers — in plain
English — just about any question you’ll have about using the program for your
bookkeeping needs. Spend the money and get the book. Any money spent on
increasing your knowledge is money well spent (and may be a tax write-off).
I update my QuickBooks software yearly, and the product improvements result
in it taking me less time to perform my bookkeeping tasks. If you find that you
don’t have time to input your bookkeeping data, you may have to hire a book-
keeper. The bonus is that professional bookkeepers probably already know
QuickBooks, and the best part is that they can print daily reports for you that
keep you apprised of your business condition. Also, at the end of each year,
QuickBooks will supply you with all the official reports your enrolled agent
(EA) or certified public accountant (CPA) will need to do your taxes. (Yes, you
really do need an EA or a CPA.) You can even send them a backup on a zip disk
or a CD-ROM. See how simple bookkeeping can be?
QuickBooks Pro
When you first fire up QuickBooks Pro, you must answer a few questions to
set up your account. Among the few things you need to have ready before
you even begin to mess with the software are the following starting figures:
✦Cash balance: This may be the amount in your checking account (no
personal money, please!) or the amount of money deposited from your
eBay profits. Put these profits into a separate checking account to use
for your business.
✦Accounts receivable balance: Does anyone owe you money for some
auctions? Outstanding payments make up this total.
✦Account liability balance: Do you owe some money? Are you being
invoiced for some merchandise that you haven’t paid for? Total it and
enter it when QuickBooks prompts you.
If you’re starting your business in the middle of the year, gather any previous
profits and expenses that you want to include because you’ll have to input
this information for a complete annual set of diligently recorded books. I can
guarantee that this is going to take a while. But you’ll be thanking me for
insisting that you get organized. It just makes everything work smoother in
the long run.

QuickBooks EasyStep Interview
After you’ve organized your finances, you can proceed with the QuickBooks
EasyStep Interview, which is shown in Figure 3-1. The EasyStep Interview is
designed to give those with accounting phobia and those using a bookkeep-
ing program for the first time a comfort level. If you mess things up, you can
always use the back arrow and change what you’ve input. If you need help,
simply click the Help button and the program will answer many of your
questions. Hey, if worst comes to worst, you can always delete the file from
the QuickBooks directory and start over.
For the whirlwind tour through the QuickBooks EasyStep Interview, just
follow these steps (which are only a general guideline):

QuickBooks integrates with PayPal
PayPal can provide your payment history in
QuickBooks format. They even offer a settlement
and reconciliation system download that breaks
up your PayPal transactions into debits and
credits. A handy feature! One warning though:
These are only financial transactions. When you
use QuickBooks to its fullest, you will have your
inventory in the program. When you purchase
merchandise to sell, QuickBooks sets up the
inventory — and deducts from it each time you
input an invoice or sales receipt. This way your
inventory receipts follow GAAP. Later in the
chapter, I show you the procedures for posting
your weekly (or daily) sales in QuickBooks by
using sales receipts.

1. Start QuickBooks, and choose the Create a New Company option.
You’re now at the EasyStep Interview.
2. On the first page of the interactive portion of the interview, type your
company name (this becomes the filename in your computer) and the
legal name of your company.
If you’ve filed a fictitious name statement (see Chapter 1), the fictitious
name is the legal name of your company.
3. Continue to follow the steps, answering other questions about your
business, such as the address and the type of tax form you use.
4. When QuickBooks asks what type of business you want to use, choose
Retail: General.
If you have another business than your eBay sales, perhaps consulting
or teaching others, you may way to just accept a blank QuickBooks 
company with no specified business option and build your own chart 
of accounts from the one they give you — that’s what I did.
QuickBooks doesn’t offer an online sales business choice, so Retail:
General is the closest to what you need (see Figure 3-2). With the chart
of accounts that I feature in the following section, you can make the
appropriate changes to your accounts to adapt to your eBay business.
5. When QuickBooks asks whether you want to use its chosen chart of
accounts, choose Yes.
See Figure 3-3.You can always change the accounts later. If you want to
spend the time, you can input your entire custom chart of accounts
manually (but I really, really don’t recommend it).

6. Answer some more general questions, which I’m sure you can handle
with the aid of the intuitive QuickBooks help area.
7. When the preferences pages appear, I recommend that you select the
“Enter the bills first and then enter the payments later” option.
That way, if you input your bills as they come in, you can get an exact idea
of how much money you owe at any time by just starting the program.
8. Click the box to indicate that you collect sales tax.
9. On the Sales Tax preferences page, indicate the agencies for which
you collect sales tax, and then set up the tax collecting information,
as shown in Figure 3-4.

10. Decide whether you want to use QuickBooks to process your payroll.
Even if you’re the only employee, using QuickBooks payroll informa-
tion makes things much easier when it comes to filling out your payroll
deposits. QuickBooks automatically fills in federal forms for your quarterly
tax processing and prints the appropriate form ready for your signature
and mailing.
11. Answer a few more questions including whether you want to use the
cash basis or accrual basis of accounting.
The accrual basis posts sales the minute you write an invoice or post a
sales receipt, and posts your expenses as soon as you post the bills into
the computer. Accrual basis accounting gives you a clearer picture of
where your company is financially than cash basis accounting does. The
cash basis is when you record bills by writing checks — expenses are
posted only when you write the checks. This way of doing business may
be simpler, but the only way you’ll know how much money you owe is
by looking at the pile of bills on your desk.
12. If you’re comfortable, just click Leave and input the balance of your
required information directly into the program without using the
interview.
If you’re new to bookkeeping, you may want to go through the interview
step-by-step with a tutor at your side. For more details, remember to check
out QuickBooks 2004 For Dummies — this book can teach you almost every-
thing you need to know about QuickBooks.
QuickBooks chart of accounts
After you’ve finished the EasyStep Interview and have successfully set up
your business in QuickBooks, the program presents a chart of accounts.
Think of the chart of accounts as an organization system, such as file folders.
It keeps all related data in the proper area. When you write a check to pay 
a bill, it deducts the amount from your checking account, reduces your
accounts payable, and perhaps increases your asset or expense account.
You have a choice of giving each account a number. These numbers, a 
kind of bookkeeping shorthand, are standardized throughout bookkeeping.
Believe it or not, everybody in the industry seems to know what number
goes with what item. To keep things less confusing, I like to use titles as
well as numbers.

To customize your chart of accounts, follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences.
2. Click the Accounting icon (on the left).
3. Click the Company preferences tab and indicate that you’d like to use
account numbers.
An editable chart of accounts appears, as shown in Figure 3-5. Because
QuickBooks doesn’t assign account numbers by default, you’ll need to
edit the chart to create them.
4. Go through your QuickBooks chart of accounts and add any missing
categories.
You may not need all these categories and you can always add more later.
In Table 3-1, I show you a chart of accounts that a CPA wrote for an eBay
business. To get an idea of how you can customize the chart of accounts,
also look at Figure 3-6, which shows you the chart of accounts from my
own business.

QuickBooks on the Web
If you want to handle everything on the Web, use QuickBooks online service,
shown in Figure 3-7. The online QuickBooks program offers fewer features
than the home version, but if your accounting needs are simple, it may be
a solution for you. Before you decide, however, consider that while your
accounting needs may be simple now, they may not be so simple later.
Figure 3-6:

Intuit charges $19.95 a month for the service, which is comparable to buying
the QuickBooks Pro version. The online version also requires you to have a
broadband connection to the Internet so that you’re always online (dial-up
connections need not apply). The online edition doesn’t include integrated
payroll, purchase orders, online banking, and bill payments.
Using QuickBooks in Your eBay Business
QuickBooks can give you up-to-the-minute reports about the status of your
eBay business and keep track of everything — including payroll and sales
tax liability — in the background. Here are a few things that I like about using
QuickBooks to streamline an online business:
✦Inventory reports: As you purchase inventory, aside from deducting the
money from your checking account and expensing your merchandise
account, QuickBooks adds the purchased merchandise to your inven-
tory. Every time you sell an item, QuickBooks deducts the item from
your inventory. QuickBooks has many other reporting features for your
inventory and end-of-year reporting for taxes.
Figure 3-7:
QuickBooks
for the Web.

Book IX
Chapter 3
Using Bookkeeping
Software
Using QuickBooks in Your eBay Business

Figure 3-8 shows you a part of an inventory report that I pulled out of the
program. You can see how valuable the data is. With a click of my mouse, 
I can see how much I have left in stock and the average number that I’ve
sold per week.
✦Sales tax tracking: Depending on how the program is set up (based on
your own state sales tax laws), you can request a report that has all your
taxable and nontaxable sales. The report calculates the amount of sales
tax you owe. You can print this report for backup information of your
sales tax payments to the state.
✦Payroll: Whether you use the online payroll service to prepare your pay-
roll or input the deductions yourself, QuickBooks posts the appropriate
withholdings to their own accounts. When it comes time to pay your
employees’ withholding taxes, QuickBooks can generate the federal
reporting form (all filled in) for submitting with your payment.
✦Sales reports: QuickBooks gives you a plethora of reports with which you
can analyze your sales professionally. One of my favorite reports is the
Sales by Item Summary. This report gives you the following information
for every inventoried item you sell in whatever time period you choose:
• Quantity sold
• Total dollar amount sold
• Percentage of sales represented by each item
• The average price the item sold for
Figure 3-8:

tracking
report.

Using QuickBooks in Your eBay Business
758
• COGS (cost of goods sold) by item
• Average cost of goods sold by total sales per item
• Gross profit margin in dollar amounts
• Gross profit margin expressed as percentage
Depending on how you post your transactions, you can analyze your eBay
sales, Web site sales, and brick-and-mortar sales individually or together.
You can also select any date range for your reports.
Posting sales in QuickBooks the Collier way
Some online auction management services integrate with QuickBooks. This
integration means that your individual transactions can be downloaded into
the QuickBooks program, setting up a new customer for each of your sales.
Although this process is quick and easy, inputting each sale as a new customer
will make your database huge in no time. QuickBooks is a large program to
begin with, and if you’re going to use it (and update it) for several years, the
database will become even larger.
If you’ve ever worked with large files, you know that the larger the data file,
the more chance there is for the data to become corrupt. That’s the last thing
you want. Besides, QuickBooks will max out with over 14,000 customers —
very doable in several years on eBay.
To keep track of your customers, you can use an additional copy of your
PayPal monthly report and combine the download with cash sales into an
Excel (or Microsoft Works) spreadsheet to build your customer database.
In this section, I show you a procedure I developed to process my PayPal
sales. I’ve run it past several accountants and QuickBooks experts, and it’s
garnered rave reviews. I’m sharing it with you because I want you to be able
to run your business smoothly. Lots of sellers use this method. It shortens
your inputting time.
Rather than posting an invoice in my QuickBooks software for every customer
(for those few customers who need formal invoices), I can print them on
demand from eBay’s Selling Manager or PayPal. I input my sales into a cus-
tomer sales receipt as shown in Figure 3-9. Whenever I make a PayPal deposit
into my business checking account, which is every few days depending on
how busy sales are, I post my sales into QuickBooks. This way, the total of
my sales receipt equals the amount of my PayPal deposit. (If you’ve ever
tried to reconcile your PayPal deposits with your sales and your checking
account, you know how frustrating it can be.)

Book IX
Chapter 3
Using Bookkeeping
Software
Using QuickBooks in Your eBay Business
759
In my QuickBooks account, PayPal is the customer. It makes no difference
who bought what; the only thing that matters is which item sold (to deduct
from inventory) and for how much (to post to my financial data).
The program gives you the flexibility to customize forms, and Figure 3-9
shows my customized sales receipt for PayPal sales. PayPal is a taxable cus-
tomer when sales are made in the State of California, and the appropriate
sales tax is applied automatically. I added the following when I customized
the form:
✦PayPal fees: I set up PayPal fees as a credit against sales. (In Figure 3-9,
you can see they are applied as a negative.) This helps to match the total
amount of the sales receipt to my PayPal deposit. It also gives me a dis-
count line in my sales reports that tracks my total paid in PayPal fees.
The PayPal fees line appears also in the cost of goods sold area of my
financial statements.
In case you’re wondering about eBay fees, they have their own line in my
chart of accounts. I charge eBay fees to my company credit card. When
the credit card expenses are posted, I post the eBay expense to the eBay
fees account, which appears under cost of goods sold in my financial
reports. Earlier in the chapter, I show you how to set up QuickBooks for
eBay and include a suggested chart of expense and income accounts.
Figure 3-9:
My
customer
sales
receipt.

Using QuickBooks in Your eBay Business
760
✦State: I type the two-letter state abbreviation of the shipping location
with each item. This serves as backup information for my State Board of
Equalization (the California sales tax board) and also allows me to run
reports on what has sold in which states.
✦Date: The date at the top of the sales receipt is the posting date. The
date in the product posting indicates the date the PayPal payment was
posted.
✦Class: Every item posted in QuickBooks can be part of a class to make it
easier for you to isolate certain types of transactions. I set up two classes
of PayPal sales: California sales and out-of-state sales. California sales
are classified as taxable, and out-of-state sales are classified as nontax-
able. QuickBooks calculates the tax liability automatically.
✦Tax classification: When I type the first two letters into the class area
(OU for out-of-state sales and CA for in-state sales), the tax line changes
automatically to Tax or Non-Tax. QuickBooks would do this whether 
I show this field in the sales receipt or not, but by having it appear, it
serves as a secondary reminder to post the taxable class properly.
By inputting my eBay sales data in this way, I streamline the process in sev-
eral ways. I post data to only one program once. From this sales receipt I get
updated inventory reports, accurate sales tax data, and accurate expense
and income tracking. I also ease the process of reconciling my checking
account.
Using eBay’s Accounting Assistant Software
I guess eBay figured out that sellers needed help with their accounting soft-
ware. The company developed Accounting Assistant (see Figure 3-10) for use
with QuickBooks software, which is available to eBay sellers who subscribe
to Seller’s Assistant or Selling Manager or who have an eBay store.
You can download the software from the following:
http://pages.ebay.com/accountingassitant/
As of this writing, Accounting Assistant is new to eBay and they haven’t
worked out all the kinks. But keep an eye on the software because it shows
great promise for streamlining the posting of your sales.
Accounting Assistant will work with only the premium versions of QuickBooks:
QuickBooks Pro, QuickBooks Premier, or QuickBooks Enterprise.

 Fighting spam
 Choosing a good secret question and password
 Reporting hacked accounts to eBay
O
nline security is something everybody worries about, but few people
do anything about it. When people’s accounts are hacked into, they
whine and moan about online security, but don’t give any credence to the
thought that they used their user ID as their password. Maybe that wasn’t
the best choice.
Some scams pretend to be from eBay, PayPal, Citibank, and others and try
to bilk you out of your personal information. I show you a foolproof way to
recognize them. It’s time to take charge of our own security and fight back 
in the best ways we can. I also show you how spammers get your e-mail
address. Even if you never give it out, they have ways of getting it from you.
I hope to teach you how to be a little more savvy about which e-mails you
open and how to fight back.
Staying Away from Spam
Every morning when I get to my computer, I have to allow about five minutes
to clear the spam out of my e-mail. It used to take up to a half hour, consid-
ering that I flip on my computer and am greeted by close to 200 e-mails every
day. Read on to see how I’ve cut my spam scanning time!
Spam has become so sneaky. Everyone is scurrying to get the latest in anti-
spam software, but I’ve found that antispam software was causing me to
lose e-mail that I needed, because it seems that the word eBay is a favorite
of spammers. I want news on eBay, but I don’t want to get those make-a-
fortune-on-eBay e-mails. Nor do I want to help out dear Mr. Felix Kamala, son
of the late Mr. A.Y. Kamala. It seems his family lost millions in Zimbabwe to a
scammer in the government, and he wants me to help him get his secret stash
of “Fifteen million five hundred thousand united state dollars.” He was going

Staying Away from Spam
764
to give me 20% just for helping him — how thoughtful! (In case you didn’t
know, this e-mail is part of what the FBI calls the Nigerian e-mail scam —
also called the 419 scam — named after the African penal code violated with
this crime.)
A fine member of the Internet community collects these e-mails and posts
them on his Web site, www.potifos.com/fraud. Check out the page when
you have a minute — it’s quite funny!
For the record, I’m also very comfortable with the size of my body parts;
I don’t want to buy drugs from some stranger over the Internet; and I don’t
need another mortgage.
Keeping your e-mail address quiet
Have you ever signed up for anything on the Internet? Before you signed up,
did you check to see whether the site had a posted privacy policy page? You
probably didn’t. After you type your name in a box on the Internet on a site
with no spam or privacy policy, you’re basically giving your privacy away,
because you’re considered an opt-in customer. Opt in means that you asked
to be on a list, and the site that now has your e-mail address can sell it to
spammers.
Take a look at Figure 4-1. It’s a portion of an ad that should really scare you.
It’s an eBay auction for a CD containing 140,000,000 opt-in e-mail addresses.
Yes, and you can buy all those potential suckers for only $5.
Just opening your e-mail can give you away as well. Spammers will often
make up return e-mail addresses to mask their true location (as you can tell
by some of the “From” addresses). If you open and view their e-mail, the
e-mail sends a notice to the spammer’s server, and then they know that the
e-mail address is valid. This practice can also be masked in the HTML to
occur when the e-mail consists of merely a picture — when it goes back to
grab the picture for your e-mail, it reports that your e-mail address is good.

Recognizing spam
Much of the spam you get can be recognized by the subject line. I used to
check my e-mail once I downloaded it to my computer. That’s a dangerous
procedure, though, considering that some e-mails do their job even if you
don’t respond. Now I’m using a program called MailWasher Pro. The com-
pany also makes a free version, described next.
Finding spam before it finds you
When I flip on my computer in the morning, I open MailWasher and see a
barrage of trash in my mailbox, as shown in Figure 4-2.
MailWasher lists your e-mail directly from your ISP’s server. It does not down-
load the e-mail to your computer. By using MailWasher, you can delete the
offending e-mails from your mailbox, and then bring only the ones you want
into your e-mail program.
As you can see from Figure 4-2, I can find out the following:
✦Who sent the e-mail: I’m not really acquainted with Lavonne N. Bingham
(note that her e-mail address ends in .be — that’s Belgium). I’m also not
familiar with Viola Cantu, who strangely has jsavcxy as her e-mail ID at
Yahoo. Not to mention my buddy, chun-she, otherwise known as carrie
@t-online.de. Hmmm, Germany? Don’t know anyone there either.
✦E-mail subject: Just in case chun-she really does know me, he or she
should know that I can’t read the Cyrillic subject line, (see the high-
lighted row in Figure 4-2). I’m pretty sure I can delete that one. And
although Velma sent me an e-mail letting me know how much I’d enjoy
Figure 4-2:
The free
version of
MailWasher.

Staying Away from Spam
766
something, I’m really too busy to enjoy anything just now, so I guess I’ll
delete that e-mail too.
✦To: The To line can be a definite tip-off that an e-mail is spam. If someone
has e-mailed to a name other than my own or to an e-mail box at my Web
site (with news about mortgages), I can assume that the e-mail wasn’t
sent by someone I know. For example, one e-mail was sent to Yvette. I
have no Yvette at this e-mail address! There are no dummies here either.
✦Attachments: If there’s an attachment from someone I don’t know, I
delete the entire e-mail. As a matter of fact, I delete most e-mails with
attachments. If a friend wants to send me something, they can always
resend it.
MailWasher allows you to put check marks next to suspect e-mails. You can
merely delete them, or you can bounce them back to whence they came and
blacklist them (so they’ll always be marked for deletion if they e-mail you
again).
My e-mail program is set to get e-mail from the server only when I ask it to, so
after I delete all the spam, I can click Send/Receive and feel considerably safer.
I use the Pro version of MailWasher (see my Web site for details), which can
scan more than one e-mail account. However, I suggest that you download
the free version for one e-mail account and see whether you like it before
paying $29.95 for the Pro version. You can download the free version at
www.mailwasher.net.
Checking out nefarious e-mail
What? It seems I’ve received an e-mail from PayPal. They say my account
needs to be renewed. Oh my! I certainly don’t want to lose my PayPal account.
Or how about an e-mail from PayPal that says: We recently reviewed your
account and suspect that your PayPal account may have been accessed by an
unauthorized third party. Protecting the security of your account and of the
PayPal network is our primary concern. Therefore, as a preventative measure,
we have temporarily limited access to sensitive PayPal account features.
Click below in order to regain access to your account:
STOP RIGHT THERE!
Take a good look at the e-mail. Who is it addressed to? When PayPal sends
you an e-mail, the opening line says Dear (your registered name). In my case
a real e-mail from PayPal read “Dear Marsha Collier.” These spam e-mails are
usually addressed to “Dear Valued User” or “Dear youremailaddress.com.”
PayPal will never address an e-mail to your e-mail address!

Book IX
Chapter 4

Secure Online

767
Responding to these e-mails is tantamount to giving away your information
to a stranger. Let me give you a tip on another way to double-check these
e-mails. Open the e-mail, as I have in Figure 4-3. Note: This trick works only
with HTML e-mail. (An e-mail is in the HTML format if you can right-click it
and see a View Source option.)
Right-click your mouse and choose View Source. The Notepad program opens,
and you see the e-mail in HTML text. Scroll to the bottom. In the example, I
scrolled to the line that says Please follow the link below followed by a URL,
as shown in Figure 4-4.
Take a good long look at the figure. You’ll see the link to the URL in the e-mail.
But look just before it in the source code and you can see that you’re really
being redirected to http://66.223.44.203/cgi/index.htm — not to the
PayPal secure URL!
Figure 4-4:
The HTML
coding for
the link URL
address.
Figure 4-3:
Viewing the
source on
an e-mail.

Staying Away from Spam
768
When I click the link, I come to a duplicate of the PayPal Log In page — or is
it? A quick glance at the address bar of my browser confirms I’ve been misdi-
rected, as shown in Figure 4-5. If I was on PayPal, the URL address would read:
https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_login-run. (Note that
the real PayPal URL begins with https, not http. The s in https stands for
secure.)
Even checking the URL may be misleading if you’re using Internet Explorer
as your browser. Bad-deed doers can exploit a vulnerability in the browser
to display a fake URL in the address and status bars. To avoid these Microsoft
glitches, be sure to keep your Windows critical updates, er, up to date. Visit
http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com regularly and install any critical
security updates.
If you still question whether your PayPal or eBay account has a problem,
close the e-mail and go directly to the site and log in at the real URL. If your
account does have a problem, you’ll know right away.
Fighting back!
There’s quite a bit that you can do to help stop spam. Have you ever clicked
the link at the bottom of some spam you’ve received to have your name
removed from their list? I have, at least until I found out that’s the gold stan-
dard for collecting valid e-mail addresses! If you respond to the spam in any
way, shape, or form, they know they have a valid address — and watch the
spam to your mailbox increase!
Never, I repeat, never click one of those links again.
When signing up for some sort of newsletter with an organization you’re 
new to or unsure of, use an anonymous Yahoo! or HotMail address. It’s easy
enough to sign up for one, and if spammers get hold of that address, they
will not be privy to your private address.
Also, no matter how curious you are about enlarging certain parts of your
anatomy, don’t even open the e-mails you receive on those topics. And cer-
tainly don’t respond.

Last, report spammers. Several legitimate sites take reports and forward
them to the appropriate authorities. Don’t bother trying to forward the spam
to the sender’s ISP. These days they’re mostly forged with aliases, and all
you’ll do is succeed in clogging up the e-mail system. The following is a list
of places you can go to report spammers:
✦Federal Trade Commission: Yes, your tax dollars are at work. The FTC
would like you to forward the most annoying spam to uce@ftc.gov,
where it will become available for law enforcement. (Especially in the
case of e-mail trying to get your personal information.)
✦spamcop.net: They’ve been around since 1988 and report spam e-mails
to ISPs and mailers. They have a reporting link on their home page and
work hard to get spammers out of the loop.
Keeping Your Password Secure
When was the last time you changed your passwords? I mean the whole
enchilada: eBay, PayPal, your online bank account? Hey, I’m not the keeper of
the shoulds, but you should change your critical passwords every 60 days —
rain or shine. That’s not just me saying that. It’s all the security experts who
know this kind of stuff. The world is full of bad-deed doers just waiting to get
their hands on your precious personal information. Password theft can lead
to your bank account being emptied, your credit cards being pushed to the
max, and worst of all, someone out there posing as you.
You’ve seen the commercials on TV poking fun at the very real problem of
identity theft. If you ask around your circle of friends, no doubt you’ll find
someone who knows someone who’s been in this pickle. It can take years to
undo the damage caused by identity theft, so a better plan is to stay vigilant
and protect yourself from becoming a victim.
In this section I give you some tips for selecting good passwords and other
personal security information. I also show you the type of passwords to stay
away from and what to do if (heaven forbid!) your personal information is
compromised.
Reporting hacked accounts
If someone gets hold of your personal information, the most important thing
to do is report it immediately. If you see any items that aren’t yours on the
Items I’m Bidding On or the Items I’m Selling area of your My eBay page, it’s
time to make a report — and fast!
Okay, you know that something hinky is going on with your eBay account
because you never placed a bid on the Britney Spears stage-worn T-shirt (did

Keeping Your Password Secure
770
you?). And you can’t imagine that your spouse did either (but double-check
just to be sure). Here’s what to do immediately:
✦Change your personal e-mail account password with your ISP: Go to
your ISP’s home page (for example www.earthlink.net) and look for
an area called Member Center or something similar. In the Member
Center, access your personal account information — probably through 
a link called something like My Account. You should be able to change
your password there.
✦Change the e-mail account password on your home computer: Don’t
forget to change the password on your computer’s e-mail software as
well (Outlook, Eudora, and the like), so you can continue to download
your e-mail from the server.
Perhaps you discover that your private information has been compromised
when you suddenly can’t log in to your eBay or PayPal account. If this hap-
pens on eBay, follow these steps to request a new password:
1. Go to the eBay Sign In page.
Don’t type your password. You just tried that and it doesn’t work.
2. Click the Forgot your password link, as shown in Figure 4-6.
Doing this takes you to http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.
dll?ForgotYourPasswordShow. Those silly security questions that you
answered when you registered for eBay become very important now.
3. Answer at least one of the questions you see on the page and provide
your registered phone number and zip code.

4. Click Continue.
eBay will e-mail you instructions for resetting your password.
5. When the e-mail arrives, follow the steps and change your password.
If you don’t get eBay’s e-mail telling you how to change your password,
that means some fraudster may have changed the contact information in
your eBay account. See the sidebar “Freaking out is not a good thing” for
instructions on what to do.
6. If all goes well and you can change your password, go to the link pic-
tured in Figure 4-7 to change your password hint (secret question).
Choosing a good secret question
If you read the harrowing procedure in the “Freaking out is not a good thing”
sidebar, you know that having someone sabotage your eBay account is some-
thing you never want to go through. But if your secret question is easy to
figure out, a hacker can find it even easier to wreak havoc on your account.
Your password is only as secure as the secret question, so don’t relate your
password and secret question in any way. For example, do not make your
secret question a clue to your password — and especially don’t make your
password answer the secret question. Better yet, think of your secret ques-
tion as a separate, auxiliary security device for your account.

Freaking out is not a good thing
If you can’t seem to get a new password for your eBay account, and you’re unsuccessful at find-
ing a Live Chat link, there’s still hope. Remain calm, follow these steps, and take notes as you go:
1. Go to any eBay page, scroll all the way to the bottom, and click the Security Center link (see
the figure).
2. When you get to the Security Center, click Report Problem.
The Contact Us form appears.
3. Highlight the parameters of your problem, as pictured in the figure.
In box 1, highlight Ask about registration, passwords, changing e-mail/User ID. In box 2, high-
light Passwords. In box 3, highlight Report that someone else changed your password.
4. Click Continue.
5. On the next page I click the Securing Your Account and Reporting Account Theft link.

you open the account.) So that is definitely out — you don’t want to give
anybody that word.
✦Select a question and provide a creative answer:
• What is your pet’s name? Give an answer like Ralph the Rhino or
Graak the Pterodactyl or something creative. Don’t give your actual
pet’s name (or species). Anyone who knows you is likely to know
your pet’s name.
• What street did you grow up on? Name an unusual landmark from
your hometown. Don’t use a street name.

• What is the name of your first school? Make up a good one — 
perhaps Elementary Penguin Academy? School of Hard Knox?
• What is your father’s middle name? Make up a goodie or skip it.
• What is your school’s mascot? There’s a lot of creativity that can go
on here. How about Red-and-white-striped zebra? Pink elephant?
Stay smart: Don’t be a make-it-easy!
Any beginning hacker (or tech smart teenager)
can figure out your password if it falls into the
following categories. Don’t use ’em! They are
pathetically easy!
 The obvious: The word Password. D’oh!
 Birthdays: Don’t use your birthday, your
friend’s birthday, or John F. Kennedy’s birth-
day. Not only are these dates common
knowledge, but so is this truism: A series of
numbers is easy to crack.
 Names: Don’t use your first name, last
name, your dog’s name, or anyone’s name.
Again, it’s common knowledge and easy to
find out. (Most people know my husband’s
name; it’s been in many of my books!)
 Contact numbers: Social Security number (if
they get hold of that one — watch out!),
phone numbers, your e-mail address, or street
address (got the white pages? So do they . . .).
 Any of the lousy passwords in the table:
The words in this table have been gleaned
from password dictionaries available from
hackers. Note that this is not a complete list
by any means; there are thousands of
common (lousy) passwords, and unprint-
able ones are more common than you may
think. If you really care to scare yourself,
Google the phrase common passwords.

It should go without saying, but what the heck: Don’t use any of the sample
passwords shown here. It’s safe to say that lots of people will be reading this
book, and anything seen by lots of people isn’t secret. (I know you know that,
but still.)
Your bylaws for selecting answers to a secret question are two: be creative
and be sure you remember the darned thing!
Poorly chosen passwords are the number-one loophole for hackers. If you
think that hackers are just a small group of hypercaffeinated teenagers, think
again. It’s now also the domain of small- and big-time crooks who hack into
an account, spend a few thousand dollars that belong to someone else, and
move on.
I searched Google for hacking software and came up with over 2 million
matches. Many of these Web sites offer an arsenal of free hacking tools.
They also provide step-by-step instructions for beginners on how to crack
passwords. The Internet can be its own worst enemy.
Here are some industrial-strength tips for setting a secure password:
✦Number of characters: Compose your password of more than 
8 characters.
✦Case sensitivity: Because passwords are case-sensitive, take advantage
of the feature. Mix lowercase and uppercase in your passwords.
✦Letters and numbers: Combine letters and numbers to make your pass-
words harder to crack.
✦Proper words: Don’t use proper words. Think of the title of your favorite
book. Make your password the first two letters of each word with num-
bers in the middle (not sequential).

 Setting up your network
 Getting secure, Internet style
T
he first time I spoke to my editors about putting information in my books
about networking, they scoffed at me. Bah! People who work at home
don’t need networks (as if networks were solely for big companies with lots
of cubicles). The more I spoke to the eBay community, the more I saw the
need for networks — and the more people asked me about them.
I started writing about eBay in 1999, and now it’s 2004. A lot of technology
has washed under the bridge, and many advances have been made. Setting
up a network in 1999 meant spending hours (maybe days) changing settings,
testing, checking computers, and cursing. That was if you were lucky enough
to finally get it right. Otherwise, as was the case of most home users —
including me — you’d give up and take the whole thing as a loss and go on
with your life.
Lucky for us nontechie types, Microsoft has made Windows considerably
more home-network friendly than in the old days. Also, more pleasant modes
of networking (other than having miles of Ethernet cables going around the
walls of your house) came to the fore of technology.
By networking your home (or eBay office) you’ll save time by having the
flexibility to work from different rooms or locations. You can also list auc-
tions out by the pool (or in your backyard) in summer!
What is a network? A network is a way to connect computers so that they
can communicate with each other — as if they were one giant computer
with different terminals. The best part is that a network enables high-speed
Internet connection sharing, as well as the sharing of printers and other
peripherals. By setting up a computer network, one computer might run
bookkeeping, another might run a graphics server, and others might be
used as personal PCs for different users. From each networked computer,
it’s possible to access programs and files on all other networked computers.
Today’s technologies allow you to perform this same miracle on the home
network. You can connect as many computers as you like, and run your

business from anywhere in your home — you can even hook up your laptop
from the bedroom if you don’t feel like getting out of bed.
Now for the whys of a home network. A network is a convenient way to run 
a business. All big companies use them, and so should you. You can extend
your DSL line or Internet cable connection so that you can use it anywhere
in your home — as well as in your office.
In a network, you can set certain directories in each computer to be shared.
That way, other computers on the network can access those directories. You
can also password-protect certain files and directories to prevent others
(your children or your employees) from accessing them.
This chapter is a quick and dirty discussion of home networks installed on
Windows-based PCs. I give you a lesson on what I know works for most
people. (Hey, if it doesn’t work, don’t e-mail me — head back to the store
and get your money back!)
At this point, I want to remind you that I’m not a techno-whiz (just like I’m
not a lawyer or an accountant). For more information about anything you’d
think to ask about home networking, I defer to Kathy Ivens, author of Home
Networking For Dummies (published by Wiley).
Variations of a Home Network
You have a choice of four types of home networks: Ethernet, powerline,
home phoneline, and wireless. See Table 5-1 for a quick rundown of some
pros and cons of each.

The home phoneline network is fading in popularity because people don’t
have enough phone jacks in their houses to make it an easy proposition. The
wireless network is currently the hot ticket and highly touted by the geek
gurus. There may be interference with a wireless signal because it runs with
the same 2.4 GHz technology as some home wireless telephones. I have a
wireless network as a secondary network, and it works, kinda. My primary
network is a hybrid, combining Ethernet, home phoneline, and wireless.
With broadband over powerline, you get high-speed Internet directly into
your home electrical system. Just plug in your powerline boxes (more on
that later) and you’re up and running!
All networks need the following two devices:
✦Router: A router allows you to share a single Internet IP address among
multiple computers. A router does exactly what its name implies; it routes
signals and data to and from the different computers on your network. If
you have one computer, the router can act as a firewall or even a network
device leading to a print server (a gizmo that attaches to your router
and allows you to print directly to a printer without having another 
computer on).
✦Modem: You need a modem for an Internet connection. You get one
from your cable or phone company and plug it into an outlet with cable
(just like your TV) or into a phone jack with the phone line for DSL. The
modem connects to your router with an Ethernet cable.
So many networks, so little time
The best part of networking today is that you
can combine more than one type of network to
form a fully functional, professional data-trans-
fer medium with Internet access throughout the
house. In my house, I have an Ethernet/home
phoneline/wireless combination. Home phone-
line networks (10 Mbps networks operating
over existing phone lines without the need for
additional wiring, routers, or hubs) aren’t popu-
lar with consumers. It’s not that they didn’t work
flawlessly; they did. It just seems that I’m the
only one in the United States with enough free
phone jacks in their home and office to make it
work.
After the downfall of phoneline architecture,
the geniuses began to think, “What does the
average home have lots of outlets for?”
Hmmmm, how about electricity? Duh, the pow-
erline network was born, running the network
through a home’s electric outlets.
Now we have wireless networks too — and
they’re life-changing when they work. It’s funny
to see a new generation of people moving
around antennas to try to get a good signal. It
reminds me of television when I was a kid.
(Maybe I should put some tin foil around the
wireless antenna?)

Variations of a Home Network
780
If you have broadband, you don’t even need to have a main computer turned
on to access the connection anywhere in the house. If you keep a printer
turned on (and have a print server), you can also connect that to your router
and print from your laptop in another room — right through the network.
Before touching your network card or opening your computer to install any-
thing, touch a grounded metal object to free yourself of static electricity.
Otherwise, a spark could go from your hand to the delicate components on
the network card or another card, thereby rendering the card useless. Better
yet, go to an electronics store and purchase a wrist grounding strap (a cord
with a gator clip), which you clip to a metal part of the computer before
touching anything inside for safety.
Using a powerline network
An ingenious invention, a powerline network uses your existing home power-
lines to carry your network and your high-speed Internet connection. You
access the network by plugging a powerline adapter from your computer
into an electrical outlet in the wall. Powerline networks have been around
for a while and are in the second round of technological advances.
Hooking up a powerline network is so easy that it’s a bit disappointing — you’ll
wonder why it isn’t more complicated. Most installations work immediately
right out of the box. Figure 5-1 shows you the base setup. Other rooms need
only a powerline bridge adapter hooked up to the computer with an Ethernet
cable to a network card.
To set up a powerline network, you’ll need the following (in addition to a
router and modem):

✦Electrical outlets: I’ll bet you have more than one in each room.
✦An Ethernet card for each computer: Many new computers already have
an Ethernet card. If yours doesn’t, you can get inexpensive Ethernet cards
for around $10 each.
✦Powerline Ethernet bridge for each computer: You plug an Ethernet
cable from your computer into the powerline Ethernet bridge, a small
box about the size of a pack of cigarettes that plugs into any two or
three-pronged electrical outlet. See Figure 5-2.
The benefits of this nifty little system are as follows:
✦It’s inexpensive. The requisite powerline magic box costs around $40,
but you’ll need one for each computer.
✦It’s fast, as fast or faster than other network connections. You could
stream DVD movies from one room to another.
✦The networking connection is made through your existing electrical
wiring. It doesn’t consume extra electricity.
✦Installation is easy. Just plug a cable into your computer, and connect
the cable to the powerline box. Plug in the powerline box.
✦If your computer has an Ethernet jack, you don’t need to open up your
computer. Most new computers come with an Ethernet jack.
If you have a high-speed Internet connection, no doubt you received a modem
when you signed up. Because it’s not common to connect the modem directly
to your computer (a router does the network routing for you), you may already
have a router.
The integration works like this:
✦The high-speed connection comes in through your DSL or cable line.
✦The cable (or DSL) line plugs into your modem.
✦An Ethernet cable goes from your modem into a router.

✦One “out” Ethernet cable connection from the router goes to a local
computer.
✦Another “out” Ethernet cable goes to the powerline adapter.
✦The powerline box plugs into a convenient wall outlet.
When you want to connect the computers in other rooms to the network,
just plug in a magic powerline box.
Hooking up with wireless
Wireless networking (also known as WiFi or IEEE 802.11 networking) is the
hot new technology for all kinds of networks. It’s an impressive system when
it works, with no cables or connectors to bog you down.
As a matter of fact, I was in New York recently, staying on the 16th floor of a
hotel. I turned on my travel laptop to check e-mail and my laptop found sig-
nals for nine wireless networks! I had to call the front desk to find out which
one was the hotel connection. The whole world seems to be going wireless.
Just so you know, I wouldn’t have been able to connect to the other networks.
Wireless networks are protected by their own brand of security, called WEP
(or wired equivalent privacy). WEP encrypts your wireless transmissions
and prevents others from getting into your network. Although superhackers
have cracked this system, it’s the best one possible until a new security
system is invented.
To link your laptop or desktop to a wireless network with WEP encryption,
you need the key code from the wireless access point. (The access point is
the gizmo with the antenna that broadcasts your signal throughout your
home or office.) Just enter it into the wireless card software on every com-
puter that uses the network, and you should be good to go.
Some WiFi hotspots you may come across may not have any encryption, and
may be free for all to use.
The different flavors of wireless
If you’ve ever used a wireless telephone at home, you’ve used a technology
similar to a wireless network. Most home wireless phones transmit on the
radio frequency band of 2.4 GHz and have the option to choose from several
channels automatically to give you the best connection.
The two prevalent forms of wireless networks also work on the 2.4 GHz
band, and you will need to preset the channel when you set up the system.
But there are basically three types of wireless:

Book IX
Chapter 5
Networking 
Your Office
Variations of a Home Network
783
✦802.11a: This is a wireless format that works really well — fast with good
connectivity. It’s used when you have to serve up a wireless connection
to a large group of people, such as in a convention center or a dormi-
tory. It’s fast, delivering data at speeds as high as 54 Mbps (megabits
per second). It also runs at the 5 GHz band (hence its nickname WiFi5),
so it doesn’t compete with wireless phones or microwave ovens for
bandwidth. It’s also very expensive.
✦802.11b: My laptop has a built-in 802.11b card, so I can connect to the
ever popular hotspots in Starbucks and airports. It’s the most common
wireless type and is used on the most platforms right now. The b version
is slower than the a version and can transfer data at only 11 Mbps. It’s 
a solid, low-cost solution when you have no more than 32 users per
access point.
The lower frequency of 2.4 GHz drains less power from laptops and other
portable devices. Also, 2.4 GHz signals travel farther, and can work
through walls and floors more effectively than 5 GHz signals.
✦802.11g: This is the newest flavor based on the 2.4 GHz band. It speeds
data to a possible 54 Mbps and is backward compatible with 802.11b
service.
Setting up your wireless network
With a wireless network, you have to hook your computer (a laptop works
best) to a wireless access point to perform some beginning setup tasks such
as choosing your channel and setting up your WEP code. (The wireless access
point will come with instructions from the manufacturer.)
When you complete the setup and turn on your wireless access point, you
have a WiFi hotspot in your home or office. Typically, your new hotspot will
provide coverage for about 100 feet in all directions, although walls and floors
cut down on the range. Even so, you should get good coverage throughout a
typical home. For a large home, you can buy signal boosters to increase the
range of your hotspot.
Simplified, this is how you configure your network:
1. Run a cable from your DSL or cable line to your modem.
2. Connect an Ethernet cable from your modem to your router.
3. Connect the Ethernet cable to your wireless access point.
Take a look at this network diagram from Netgear in Figure 5-3.

Using a home phoneline network
According to the Home Phoneline Networking Alliance (HPNA) — the associ-
ation that works with hardware companies to develop a single networking
standard — tests indicate that phoneline network technology can be suc-
cessfully installed and operational in 99% of today’s homes. In real life, how
your home is wired and the quality of those wires dictate that success.
Even though this network is hard to find (you can get great deals on eBay), it
works like magic with Windows XP. I can hook up to my network successfully
from 90% of the phone jacks in my house. The wall telephone cabling contains
four wires, and your telephone uses only a portion of two. There’s plenty more
room in the cable for your network.
The phoneline network sends data at a speedy 10MB per second (the same
speed as a regular Ethernet network). The network can operate with com-
puters or other equipment placed as far as 1000 feet apart and will work in
homes as large as 10,000 square feet. Best of all, you can talk on the same
phoneline without causing interference.

Take a look at the jacks at the end of all your phone cords; if you see only
two copper-colored wires in the plastic jack, toss the cord. The ones that
you need to carry your full load must have four wires visible in the clear
plastic end of the jack.
To set up your network to carry files and the high-speed connection through-
out your house, you need some extra hardware:
✦Bridge: A device that connects your Ethernet (router connection) with
your powerline network. You can get a device that combines the router
and the bridge.
✦HPNA network adapter for each computer: You need an adapter that
enables your computer to become one with other computers on the net-
work. These adapters are available also as a USB device, eliminating the
need to install a card in your computer.
✦Phone jacks: Kind of essential for plugging in the phone wire from the
adapter.
Installing a home phoneline network is about as easy as installing the power-
line network. Just follow these steps (be sure to follow your manufacturer’s
instructions if they vary from this information):
1. Turn off your computer, disconnect its power cord, and open the com-
puter’s cover.
If you’re installing a USB (universal serial bus) adapter, don’t bother
trying to open your computer. Just plug in the adapter to an available
USB port and proceed to Step 4.
2. Install the network card in an available slot.
Touch the card only by the metal part on its outside edge. When installing
the card, press down firmly on the top of the card with your thumb to
properly seat the card in the slot. Fasten the card to the chassis by tight-
ening the screw on the metal edge.
3. Replace the cover on your PC and reconnect the power cord.
4. Connect one end of the telephone (RJ-11) cord that came with your
network card to the port labeled To Wall on the card. Plug the other
end into a convenient wall telephone jack.
If you have a telephone that needs to use that wall jack, connect the
cord to the port labeled To Phone; your telephone will work through
the network card.
5. Power up your computer.
If you’re lucky, your computer will see the new hardware and ask you to
install the driver. If you’re not lucky, check the instructions (as a last-ditch
effort, you can always read the instructions!) for troubleshooting tips.

Variations of a Home Network
786
6. Set up directories that you want shared on the network.
Go to My Computer, select the directories (denoted by folder icons) that
you want to share, right-click, and indicate that you want to share these
directories with other computers on the network. Do the same with your
local printers.
7. Repeat Steps 1–6 on each computer.
As you add each computer, double-check that it can communicate with
the other computers that you’ve already installed on the network by
trying to open a shared directory on a remote computer and printing a
test page on a remote printer.
8. If your network is not functioning properly after you complete all rec-
ommended steps, call tech support as many times as necessary to get
your network up and running.
When your network connection is flying and working flawlessly, it’s time
to add your broadband.
9. To install the broadband connection, take the Ethernet cable from the
modem and connect it to the back of your router. Then connect another
Ethernet cable from the router to the phoneline network bridge.
10. Connect one end of the phone line (that came with your bridge) to the
bridge and the other end to a telephone wall jack.
Voila — you should be good to go with your Internet connection on all
the computers in your network.
The wall connectors each have an outlet for a telephone cord that you plug
into your wall jack. (I cheated in one room and connected two computers to
one phone jack with a splitter, which makes two jacks out of one.)
Using a hybrid network
You may find that a wireless network may not work throughout your home.
That’s easy to correct. You can combine different networks, allowing you to
have wireless connectivity in some rooms of your house and in your back-
yard, and a wired network inside your house.
I have an old-fashioned home phoneline network coming from my router,
along with a wireless access point. They’re all the same brand, Netgear, so
there are no compatibility problems. This way, no matter where I go (or if
my family wants to log onto the Internet), we can hook up with ease.

Internet Security and Your Home Network
A dial-up connection exposes your computer to the Internet only when you
dial up and get connected. Most broadband Internet connections are always
on, which means your computer is always exposed. You should shield your
computer with a strong firewall and an antivirus program.
Firewall software
When you’re connected to the Internet, you’re exposed not only to hackers
but also to threats such as Trojan horses, programs that can get into your
computer when you innocently view an infected Web site. Once inside your
computer, the Trojan horse, like ET, phones home. From there, an evil-deed
doer, now with a direct line to your computer, may be able to wreak havoc
with your precious data.
Visit the Web site for Gibson Research Corporation, at www.grc.com. Gibson
Research is the brainchild of an early PC pioneer, Steve Gibson, who’s
renowned as a genius in the world of codes and programming. Steve is the
expert when it comes to exposing the vulnerabilities of systems over the
Internet. A few free diagnostic programs on this site will check your com-
puter’s vulnerability to Internet threats.
Shields Up and LeakTest test your computer and terrify you with results that
expose the vulnerability of your Internet connection. To protect your con-
nection, check out ZoneAlarm (described on Steve’s site). This free program
(the Pro version costs $39.95) has won every major award in the industry 
as the most secure software firewall. If your main concern is safety, visit
www.zonelabs.com for a free download of ZoneAlarm.
Antivirus software
You’re going to need antivirus software to protect you from the idiots who
think it’s fun to send destructive code through e-mail. The leading programs
in this area are Norton AntiVirus and McAfee. One of the problems inherent
in buying software is that you might be urged to load much more than you
need onto your computer. If all you need is antivirus software, purchase only
antivirus software. But don’t delay. Buy it now and be sure to update the
antivirus files each week so that you’re fully protected from the latest viruses.
