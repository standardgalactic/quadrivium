About the Authors
Karen Manthey discovered her passion for crochet during the 1970s while 
she was working as a graphic artist. In 1984, her training in art and under-
standing of crochet led her to a job illustrating the magazine Crochet Fantasy. 
Her task was to create the intricate crochet diagrams that accompany many 
of today’s patterns. She soon moved on to become editor of the magazine, all 
the while continuing to do the illustrations and frequently designing projects 
for publication. After 20 years of working in an offi ce, Karen now works from 
home, devoting her time to freelance technical editing and crochet diagrams 
for numerous books, magazines, yarn companies, and designers.
Susan Brittain’s fascination with crochet began very early, around 4 or 5 
years of age. She would watch her grandmother, who had lost her sight in 
midlife, spend hours crocheting beautiful afghans for friends and family, 
counting the stitches with her fi ngers. By the age of 8, Susan was crocheting 
her own projects, starting with simple patterns such as scarves and moving 
on to afghans, toys, and sweaters. Although her creative streak has led her 
to learn many different crafts, crochet has been a steady thread throughout. 
Susan combined work with pleasure as assistant editor for Crochet Fantasy 
magazine for a little more than two years, contributing as a designer as well. 
After moving west with her family, she continues to crochet and design 
pieces for various yarn companies.
Julie Armstrong Holetz was a child of the ’70s — fl ower power, bell bottoms, 
macramé, and crochet. Taking what she learned from her mom, Julie’s fi rst 
crochet projects were simple squares that made perfect blankets for her 
dolls. Throughout her life, Julie has experimented with other arts and crafts, 
but she always returns to the meditative comfort of crochet. In 2005, Julie 
started her own business working as a freelance writer, editor, and designer 
in the craft industry. She has designed patterns for several popular books 
and magazines and serves as a freelance technical editor for prominent craft 
book publishers and magazines such as Interweave Crochet, Knitscene, 
Potter Craft, and Interweave Press. Julie lives, plays, and crochets on the 
eastside of Seattle with her husband and two children.

Dedication
To Karen’s husband, Darryl Manthey, for teaching her the meaning of perse-
verance, and to her daughter, Tanya Manthey, for her patience and her sense 
of humor, which have kept her mother going through this project and every-
thing else.
To Susan’s husband, Paul Brittain, for his love, support, and understand-
ing, and to her daughter, Angela, for putting up with the mess and the crazy 
schedule, and for waiting until I fi nished “just one more row.”
To Julie’s mom, Traudl Foster, for encouraging her to be fearless in the face 
of creativity, and to her daughter, Ally Holetz, for helping her pick colors 
when there were so many to choose from.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
We would like to thank Mike Lewis, our acquisitions editor, who was always 
there to put us on the right track, providing encouragement and support 
when we needed it.
Special thanks to Georgette Beatty, our project editor, whose keen insights 
and suggestions made our book the best it could be.
Thank you to Jennifer Tebbe, our copy editor, and Judith Obee, our technical 
reviewer, for carefully reviewing our work.
Thanks also to Rachel Russ and Sylvia Hager at Blue Sky Alpacas, Peggy Wells 
at Brown Sheep Co., Margery Winter at Berroco, Inc., Cilene Martins-Castro at 
DMC Corporation, Jeanne Duncan at Fiesta Yarns, and Jean Dunbabin at Cascade 
Yarns for generously providing yarns for the projects featured in this book.
Thank you to Alicia South, art coordinator, for her stylish perspective, and to 
Matt Bowen, photographer, for his beautiful photography.
Thanks to Swati Gunati, Mallory King, Jacqueline Porter, and Madeline 
Jakowczyk, the models who helped make our crochet come to life, and to 
Lukas and Jodie Gogis for the use of their beautiful home where several of 
the photographs were taken.
From Karen
Special thanks go to my husband, Darryl, for his encouragement, patience, 
love, and support. Also, thanks to my daughter, Tanya, for putting up with 

the mess, the late (and less-than-perfect) meals, as well as my lack of atten-
tion and focus. I couldn’t have done it without you both.
Additional thanks go to Susan, my original partner in this project, for her 
optimistic approach to life. Thanks for giving me the courage to face this 
challenge and not letting me give up before we even began.
And fi nally, thanks to Julie for bringing her excellent sense of style and cre-
ativity to this second edition of Crocheting For Dummies.
From Susan
Special thanks go out, fi rst and foremost, to my husband, Paul, for his unfail-
ing support (once again) throughout the whole writing process. Without his 
encouragement and support, this book may never have come to be.
Thanks also to my daughter, Angela, who constantly urged me to “keep going 
and get it done” and gave me the time I needed to pull all the new material 
together.
Thanks again to Karen for her expertise, for making sure the work came in on 
time, and for catching the slips that I missed.
Finally, thanks to Julie for her hard work and for providing a fresh new look 
to the patterns and introducing a “greener” way to crochet.
From Julie
I am so thankful for my husband, Steve, who is always patient and support-
ive, especially when deadlines loom. The whole family thanks him for step-
ping in when I threatened to make burritos for the fourth night in a row.
Special thanks go to my children, Thad and Ally, who banded together when I 
had to write and couldn’t play.
Thanks also to Karen for her thoughtful insight on the technical aspects of 
crochet stitches and illustrations. I am envious of her talent.
I am very grateful to Megan Granholm, who deftly crocheted a few of the proj-
ect samples, making my deadlines easier to achieve.
And fi nally, many thanks to Sue for her guidance, support, and expertise — 
all of which helped make the project fl ow smoothly and on time.

Introduction
N
o longer is crocheting considered something your grandmother did 
while sitting on the porch in her rocking chair. Crocheted designs are 
everywhere, from the racks in your favorite clothing store to fashion catalogs — 
even to the runways in Paris and Milan. Celebrities have started crocheting, and 
the craft even shows up in movies and television shows. The reasons for this 
comeback are many, and we hope that by reading this book you discover 
some of those reasons and begin to enjoy a lifelong affair with crochet.
Even though crochet is a time-honored craft, that doesn’t mean it’s behind 
the times. Advances in technology have made yarns softer and more color-
ful, with wonderful new textures appearing every time you turn around. No 
longer are crocheters limited to solid or variegated colors; yarn is now hand 
painted and space dyed. Although worsted-weight yarn is still a staple in 
every crocheter’s yarn cache, so many varieties of weights and textures are 
available today that we’re at a loss as to how to categorize them all.
You’re never too old or too young to discover crochet. The skills that you 
master, the benefits that you receive, and the beautiful heirlooms that you 
create can last a lifetime and, ideally, be passed on to future generations.
About This Book
Crocheting For Dummies, 2nd Edition, gives first-time crocheters hands-on 
experience with new skills and serves as a reference tool for those who 
already have some basic crochet know-how. We kick off the book by taking 
you step by step through the process of gathering your materials, crocheting 
your first stitches, and finishing off a piece of crocheted fabric. If that sounds 
somewhat overwhelming, relax. We include detailed written instructions and 
easy-to-follow illustrations throughout this book.
Each part of Crocheting For Dummies, 2nd Edition, contains chapters full of 
information relevant to each other, with successive parts adding more build-
ing blocks to your crochet knowledge. If you already have some crochet 
experience and are looking to refine and expand your techniques, then the 
later chapters are for you. There we include more advanced stitches and 
techniques, along with many tips to guide you. Finally, each part contains 
several projects that allow you to practice your newfound skills on fun and 
useful designs while feeling a sense of accomplishment for a job well done.

Crocheting For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
Conventions Used in This Book
We use the following conventions throughout the book to make the world of 
crochet easier for you to dive into:
 
✓ New terms appear in italics and are closely followed by an easy-to-
understand definition.
 
✓ Bold text highlights the action parts of numbered steps.
 
✓ Web addresses appear in monofont. (Some URLs may have broken 
across multiple lines as we laid out this book, but rest assured we haven’t 
added any spaces or hyphens. Just type in the address as you see it.)
 
✓ When we first introduce a new stitch or technique, we include its abbre-
viation in parentheses to help you become familiar with the shorthand 
used in crochet patterns. We also include the abbreviation the first time 
a stitch is mentioned in a set of numbered steps.
 
✓ The specific part of an illustration that relates to the step you’re working 
on is shaded dark gray. For example, if you’re inserting your hook into a 
certain stitch, that stitch is shaded so you can see exactly where to go.
What You’re Not to Read
We hope, of course, that you read every word in this book, but if you’re short 
on time, don’t worry — feel free to skip sidebars (the shaded gray boxes 
throughout the chapters). They contain interesting information, but they’re 
not crucial to your understanding of crochet.
Foolish Assumptions
How does that saying about assuming something go? Well, never mind about 
that. We explain each step as clearly and concisely as possible, so you don’t 
need any prior experience to understand the concepts introduced in this book.
We are assuming, however, that by picking up this book, you have a desire to 
master the art of crochet. Beyond that, all we ask is that you give it your best 
shot and don’t give up.

 Introduction
How This Book Is Organized
Crocheting For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is divided into five parts, with a total of 
21 chapters and one appendix. Each part focuses on a different aspect of cro-
chet. Here’s a rundown of what each part contains.
Part I: Crochet 101
Part I tells you all about the craft of crochet and the many benefits you can 
derive from it. It describes the tools you need to get started and how to wade 
through the abundance of materials on the market. This part also explains 
what gauge is (and why it’s so important) and decodes crochet abbreviations 
and instructions so you can follow them with ease.
Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques
Here’s where we really start getting down to the nuts and bolts of crochet. 
Part II offers fully illustrated, step-by-step instructions on creating the basic 
stitches upon which almost all crochet is based. It also opens the door to 
several basic techniques, such as increasing and decreasing to shape your 
work, crocheting in the round, and working with more than one color at once.
Part III: Advanced Stitches and Techniques
Part III introduces you to the many ways you can combine the basic stitches 
to create a variety of common stitch patterns. Here you discover how to 
create multiple textures by working in different places within a stitch and 
how to magically transform your project from loose and flimsy to sturdy and 
solid. Finally, you encounter three new techniques that are well worth explor-
ing: Tunisian crochet, filet crochet, and motifs.
Part IV: Putting It All Together
Sometimes you may need to crochet a project in separate sections rather 
than one whole piece. Part IV to the rescue! It introduces you to the basics 
of sweater construction with projects that include a pullover sweater and a 
simple camisole. It also shows you the various methods for joining pieces of 
crocheted fabric to create a whole. And not only do you discover how to add 
special touches, embellishments, and final details but you also find out how 
to turn your slightly rumpled pieces into smooth and shapely designs.

Crocheting For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
Part V: The Part of Tens
Part V includes a list of ten activities that allow you to share your talent and 
passion for crochet with others. And because seeing the many ways you can 
vary crochet is a kick, we include a list of ten variations for you to check out. 
Last, but certainly not least, following this part is an appendix of sources and 
resources that you’ll find handy as you continue your crocheting journey.

Where to Go from Here
Now that the introductions are over, it’s time to begin. The fun part is that 
where you start is entirely up to you! Crocheting For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is 
written so you can start reading whatever section best fits your skill level.
 
✓ If you’re an absolute beginner, we suggest starting with Part I. It has all 
the essential information that you need to begin crocheting.
 
✓ If you already have some experience with the basics and want to expand 
your knowledge, then look ahead to the chapters on more advanced 
stitches and techniques. Whenever we feel that you should know something 
that was covered in a previous chapter, we refer you to that chapter.
 
✓ If you used to crochet and are coming back to it (sometimes life just gets 
too busy for fun stuff like this), skim through the chapters to reacquaint 
yourself with the techniques. The stitches themselves haven’t changed, 
but the materials have, and you may come across some useful info.

T
his part unlocks the deep, dark mystery of crochet and 
sets you on a journey to discover a whole new skill and 
a lifetime of crocheting pleasure. Here, we introduce you to 
the tools and materials you need to begin crocheting. And 
if you’ve ever tried to read a crochet pattern and won-
dered, “What does all this gibberish mean?” wonder no 
more; we introduce you to the terminology, abbreviations, 
and symbolic language of crochet in the following pages. 
We also explain the importance of gauge and how it affects 
everything you crochet. By the end of this part, you’ll be 
ready to start playing with some basic crochet skills.

Chapter 1
Hooking into a Life of Crochet
In This Chapter
▶ Beginning with the basics of crochet
▶ Surveying fundamental techniques
▶ Expanding your selection of stitches and techniques
▶ Wrapping up your projects and sharing tips for a lifetime of happy crocheting
C
rochet has numerous beneficial qualities. Here are just a few of them:
 
✓ The soothing rhythm of creating stitches can calm even the most 
frazzled nerves. If you’re one of those people who can’t stand to be idle, 
crochet is a wonderful way to let your body get a bit of rest and not feel 
like you’re wasting time. If your family is always clamoring for you to sit 
down and watch a TV show or a special movie at night, go ahead, but 
bring along your hook and yarn.
 
✓ Crochet is also a wonderful take-along project. You can crochet on 
family road trips as well as on trains and planes (although you’ll have to 
use plastic hooks when crocheting on public transportation these days).
 
✓ According to psychological studies that have been done on the benefits 
of crochet, the focus needed to create something takes your mind off the 
bazillion little things hollering for your attention and gives your brain 
some much-needed downtime.
 
✓ Crochet also serves as an outlet for your creativity and provides a sense 
of satisfaction when you complete your design and can look at it and 
say, “I created this myself.”
 
✓ Crochet has physical benefits as well. People suffering from various 
forms of arthritis have used it as a form of physical therapy. The con-
stant movement required helps keep the hands limber and the joints 
from stiffening up.
We hope that at least one of these reasons is enough to set you on the path 
to practicing this enjoyable craft. To find out more about crochet, take a look 
at the basics we present in this chapter.

Part I: Crochet 101 
Starting with Crochet Fundamentals
If you’re like most people these days, finding the time to figure out something 
new can be a challenge. With crochet, you can pick it up when you have some 
time, put it down when you don’t, or take it with you on the run. There’s no 
mess to clean up and nothing to babysit. And you can easily find hooks and 
yarn at your local discount or craft store, as well as at the many specialty 
yarn stores that have cropped up in many towns. Basically, you don’t need to 
wait to start crocheting while you special order some obscure item.
In the following sections, we introduce you to the fundamentals of crochet: 
the tools you need, how to measure gauge, and how to decipher crochet pat-
terns. These fundamentals are what you need to know to successfully start 
your new crochet hobby.
Gathering all of your tools
One of the greatest things about crochet is that you don’t need to invest in 
tons of fancy materials or create a new room in your house to store a bunch 
of equipment. All you need to get started are a couple hooks, preferably from 
different manufacturers so you can find a style you’re comfortable with, and 
a skein of yarn. You probably have the other stuff that you need, such as a 
pair of scissors, a bag to keep all of your supplies in, and a comfy place to sit, 
at home already.
Chapter 2 gives you the skinny on the various types of hooks and yarns, as 
well as some of the other crochet gadgets available. As with any new under-
taking, understanding the basics about the materials that you’re working with 
is essential.
 
If you bought this book ten minutes ago and are already at the yarn shop, you 
probably just want to get a cheap hook and some yarn so you can start practic-
ing stitches right away. Here’s what you need to get started (for less than $5):
 
✓ A size H-8 U.S. (5 mm) crochet hook: This size hook is comfortable to 
work with, and the size of stitch it creates is easy to see.
 
✓ A light, solid-colored, worsted-weight yarn, preferably made of acrylic 
or wool fibers: Acrylic and wool yarns are great for practicing with 
because they’re inexpensive, and light-colored yarn is best initially 
because you may have a hard time seeing your stitches if the yarn 
you’re working with is too dark or multicolored.

 Chapter 1: Hooking into a Life of Crochet
Adjusting tension
Making sure that your finished projects end up being the correct size is 
important. After all, who needs a doily the size of a coaster or an afghan that 
can double as a slipcover for a sectional couch?
 
By using some simple math and working a gauge swatch (see Chapter 3), you 
ensure that your stitches are the right size and tension for your design. So 
don’t skip over the stuff at the beginning of the pattern directions; checking 
your materials and gauge keeps you out of trouble.
Crocheting from a pattern
Even crocheters with years of experience work from patterns, so knowing 
how to read them is important. Chapter 4 tells you what the abbreviations 
and symbols in patterns mean and how to decipher the instructions. To ease 
you into the language of crochet, we provide an explanation immediately after 
each line of instruction, although we urge you to take a stab at reading the 
“normal” instructions because that’s how all crochet publications present them.
To help you get used to all the abbreviations and symbols, we include them 
in parentheses every time we introduce a new stitch or technique (which 
we fully explain in plain English, by the way). The first project patterns at 
the ends of the chapters either partially or completely explain the direc-
tions in plain English, but by Chapter 8 we provide the directions solely in 
Crochetese. (Never fear; you can always flip back to Chapter 4 if you don’t 
remember something.)
Gibberish anyone?
A while back, we had an experience that 
shows just how funny crochet instructions 
can look when you’re not familiar with the ter-
minology. A young girl was leafing through a 
crochet magazine looking at the pictures, or so 
we thought. When we started paying attention 
to the noises she was making, we laughed so 
hard our sides split. The girl was reading the 
instructions phonetically (ch 3, dc in next sc, sc 
in next dc, see what we mean?). Try this with 
one of the patterns at the ends of the chapters, 
and you’ll see what we mean. Crochet abbre-
viations really can look like a bunch of gibber-
ish. Don’t worry, though; they’re actually pretty 
simple to decipher, as you find out in Chapter 4.

10
Part I: Crochet 101 
Mastering Basic Crochet Techniques
Aside from figuring out the basic stitches, you need to understand a few fun-
damental techniques: adding and subtracting stitches, changing colors, and 
working in a circle. All of these techniques are really quite easy, and master-
ing them can help you create fabulous designs. We give you a brief introduc-
tion to these basic techniques, as well as the importance of practicing them, 
in the next sections.
Practice makes perfect
You don’t learn to walk or ride a bike in a day, so don’t expect to become 
a crochet pro in just 24 hours. Getting good at crochet takes practice, but 
probably not as much as you may think. Start with the basic chain stitch 
(described in Chapter 5) and practice until you’re comfortable with the 
motions your hands must make. Then move on to another stitch. Each suc-
cessive stitch, which we walk you through step-by-step in Chapters 5 and 6, 
builds on another, so try not to skip any of them, at least in the beginning. We 
don’t want you to get frustrated and throw your work down. Believe us, in no 
time at all, you’ll be moving right along.
The majority of Crocheting For Dummies, 2nd Edition, presents techniques from 
a right-hander’s point of view, but we don’t forget you lefties. All the informa-
tion contained in this book (and there’s plenty of it!) applies to you as well. In 
Chapter 5, we get you started on the basics by illustrating steps from both the 
left- and right-handed perspectives. There we also give you a few tips to help you 
work your way through the rest of the book from a left-handed perspective.
Shape up
After you have the basic stitches down, it’s time to break away from the 
straight lines and give your projects some curves. Check out Chapter 7 to see 
just how easy it is to shape your projects by adding and subtracting stitches. 
Don’t worry; the math is simple, and so are the techniques.
Round and round you go
Because crochet stitches are so easily manipulated, you can go where other 
forms of needlework can’t, such as in circles. Although the first few chapters 
have you going back and forth in rows, Chapter 8 throws open the door to the 
world of crocheting in the round. All sorts of great projects — think doilies, 
afghans, and sweaters — are worked in rounds. This basic variation is easy, so 
don’t be afraid to try the projects in this book that are worked in rounds.

11
 Chapter 1: Hooking into a Life of Crochet
Color it in
Crochet is by no means monochromatic. Yes, you’ve seen homes with white 
doilies scattered on every surface or the hat and scarf sets made in a single, 
dull color. But just wait until you walk into your local craft store or yarn 
shop. Your senses may just be assaulted by the multitude of colors and tex-
tures now available.
 
Changing colors and carrying colors are variables you can take into consid-
eration to turn a ho-hum design into a work of art (and Chapter 9 shows you 
how to do just that).
Adding New Stitches and Techniques 
to Your Crochet Repertoire
When you’ve mastered the basics, then you’re ready to move on to even 
more fun stuff — new techniques and stitch combinations that add up to 
some creative works of art, as explained in the following sections.
 
Many so-called specialty stitches (see Chapter 10) are nothing more than the 
combination of a couple different basic stitches, just with a new name. So 
don’t be intimidated if a new technique or stitch seems too complex. Broken 
down, it’s nothing more than the basics you already know.
Having fun with new stitches
You can do many amazing things with your crochet hook. Who says you have 
to work stitches in only one place? Because crochet is just a bunch of inter-
locking loops, you can stick your hook in myriad places to create stitches 
that are flat or textured, square or round — the variety is nearly endless. 
Chapter 11 has more on working your yarn in different spots. It also includes 
a fun technique called felting, which takes your project from loose and flimsy 
to solid and durable.
Creating funky fabrics
Two types of crochet that create unique fabrics are Tunisian crochet (see 
Chapter 12) and filet crochet (see Chapter 13). You work them by using very 
specific stitch placements and by following a chart. Both of these techniques 
are easy to master, and the designs you create with them make you look like 
you’ve been crocheting for years.

12
Part I: Crochet 101 
Being square (and other shapes too)
Crochet doesn’t need to just go back and forth; you can create lots of cool 
shapes with your hook. The granny square is one of the most popular motifs in 
the crochet stitch library, but many more motifs exist in all shapes and sizes. 
Make just one for a decoration or join them together for a blanket, wrap, or 
pillow. The possibilities are endless! Head to Chapter 14 for all the details.
Finishing Your Work: Taking 
Pride in What You’ve Made
More goes into finishing your work than simply weaving in that last end of 
yarn. You may need to sew pieces together, add a pretty border, or tack on a 
tassel. After all that handling, often your new creations look a bit misshapen, 
so you need to do some blocking or shaping to pretty ’em up. And although 
you may not have spent a fortune on materials, we bet you probably don’t 
want to ruin that new sweater on the first wash. The next sections give you a 
preview of what all can go into finishing your masterpieces.
Putting the pieces together
Many crochet designs are composed of several pieces that you need to put 
together to form the whole. Chapter 15 walks you through the various meth-
ods for joining fabric, whether you sew pieces together with a yarn needle 
and yarn or you use your hook and crochet the separate pieces together. 
And because sweaters are such popular items to crochet, Chapter 16 decon-
structs the specific pieces that make up a sweater.
Tending to the final details
When you’re finished crocheting, you want to make sure your piece looks its 
best. Does it need any special finishing touches? What about some pockets? 
Or maybe a fringe? Chapters 17 and 18 give you the scoop on adding these 
and more.
 
You may need to block or starch (refer to Chapter 19) your work to get it into 
shape. Blocking is a simple process that requires water, a little heat, or some 
starch to help coax your design into place. Don’t leave out this step! The pat-
tern’s instructions may not mention blocking, but if your piece looks a little 
off, it could probably use a little blocking to whip it into shape.

 Chapter 1: Hooking into a Life of Crochet
Taking care of your crochet masterpieces
Now that you have this wonderful new creation, whether it’s wearable or a 
home décor item, you want to take certain measures to ensure it stands the 
test of time. If you care for it properly (as explained in Chapter 19), you can 
pass down your crocheted work for generations to come.
Making Your Crochet Experience 
a Good One Overall
 
You’ll inevitably experience highs and lows while you work to master crochet. 
Because we want your highs to be more plentiful than your lows, we’re shar-
ing a few tips that will help make your journey to crochet mastery a happier 
one:
 
✓ Hold the hook and yarn the way that feels the most natural and com-
fortable to you. We illustrate the most common ways in Chapter 5, but 
you may feel better using a different method.
 
✓ Always read the stitch descriptions at the beginning of each pattern. 
Different publications may use different names for stitches. Crochet isn’t 
standardized, so you may encounter names you don’t recognize. The 
pattern’s stitch descriptions should clear up any confusion.
 
✓ Check to see whether you’re working from a British or an American 
pattern before you begin. Patterns published in Great Britain and 
Australia, as well as some patterns published in Canada, use differ-
ent terminology for even the basic stitches. For example, they call the 
American single crochet a double crochet and the American double cro-
chet a treble crochet. You can end up crocheting something completely 
different from what you intended if you don’t know what type of termi-
nology you’re working with. (Flip to Chapter 4 for a list of U.S. to UK 
conversions.)
 
✓ Pick a place to work where you have few distractions. As when master-
ing any new skill, being able to focus is important.
 
✓ Practice each new stitch or technique by working a swatch. Crochet 
stitches often build on each other, so make sure you’re comfortable 
with one stitch before moving on to the next one. And don’t throw away 
your swatches — they can come in handy when you need something on 
which to practice making borders or buttonholes.
 
✓ Put your hook and yarn down and come back later if you start to feel 
frustrated with a new stitch. Sometimes a little distance can clear up a 
previously difficult section.

14
Part I: Crochet 101 
 
✓ Find an experienced crocheter to help explain a new technique that 
you’re having a hard time with. If you don’t know anyone who cro-
chets, try your local yarn shop. You can usually find someone there 
who’s well versed in the craft and more than happy to help you.
 
✓ Mark the pages of the books that you feel are most important or helpful 
to you. This way you can easily find the references you’re looking for.

▶ Discovering the many characteristics of yarn
▶ Understanding how to decode yarn labels
▶ Reviewing other helpful crochet tools
A
s with any new project that you decide to undertake, you first have to 
figure out what tools and materials you need to get the job done. For 
crocheting, your needs are pretty simple. Grab a hook and some yarn, find a 
comfortable seat, and you’re ready to go.
In this chapter, we introduce you to the different types of crochet hooks and 
when to use them, show you your yarn options and how to choose the right 
one for your project, and help you read a yarn label. We also include lists of 
other tools that aren’t necessary all the time but can be useful when you’re 
crocheting different types of designs.
The One Tool You Can’t Do 
Without: A Crochet Hook
A crochet hook is the single most important tool you use when crocheting. 
The next sections tell you everything you need to know about one, including 
why it’s shaped the way it is, the function of each part, and the purpose of 
different hook materials.
Surveying the anatomy of a crochet hook
Even though you may think a crochet hook is nothing more than a straight 
stick with a hook on one end, it actually has five distinct and necessary parts, 
which you can see in Figure 2-1.

16
Part I: Crochet 101 
 
Figure 2-1: 
The five 
parts of a 
crochet 
hook.
 
Handle
Thumb rest
Throat
Shaft
Point
Each part of a crochet hook performs a specific function.
 
✓ Point: You insert the point of the hook into previously made stitches. 
It must be sharp enough to slide easily through the stitches, yet blunt 
enough so that it doesn’t split the yarn or stab your finger.
 
✓ Throat: The throat does the actual hooking of the yarn and pulls it 
through a stitch. It must be large enough to grab the yarn size that 
you’re working with but small enough to prevent the previous loop from 
sliding off.
 
✓ Shaft: The shaft holds the loops that you’re working with, and its diam-
eter, for the most part, determines the size of your stitches.
 
✓ Thumb rest: The thumb rest helps keep the hook positioned in the right 
direction. Without it, the hook can twist in the wrong direction, and 
you can find yourself gripping the hook too tightly — leaving you with 
hooker’s cramp! (You’ll know what this is as soon as you feel the pain 
in the palm of your hand and your fingers.) The thumb rest should be 
sandwiched between your thumb and middle finger when you hold the 
hook, letting you easily rotate the hook as you work each stitch.
 
✓ Handle: The handle is used for balance or leverage. In the under-the-
hook method of holding the hook (see Chapter 5), the handle helps keep 
the hook steady and well balanced. In the over-the-hook method of hold-
ing it, the handle is held against the heel or palm of your hand and pro-
vides the leverage needed to maneuver the hook properly.
 
Different brands of crochet hooks have slightly different shapes. Some have 
sharp points, whereas others have more rounded points. Some have dis-
tinct, flat, cutout throats, whereas others have smoother, rounded throats. 
Nowadays, most of the standard-size and steel hooks have thumb rests, 
although the largest of the standard hooks don’t. (See the next section for the 
lowdown on the different types of hooks.) Take some time to experiment with 
a couple different brands of crochet hooks to find the one that you’re most 
comfortable handling. You’ll be glad you did.

 Chapter 2: Tools of the Trade
Looking at the make and size of hooks
Crochet hooks may come in a seemingly endless array of sizes and materials, 
but all of them actually fall into two main categories:
 
✓ Standard hooks are typically made of aluminum or plastic (and some-
times wood); you normally use them when working with the larger 
sizes of yarn, such as sport weight, worsted weight, and those that are 
even thicker. (We describe different yarn weights later in this chapter.) 
Standard hooks measure about 6 inches in length and vary in thickness 
from 2.5 millimeters to 19 millimeters.
 
 Plastic crochet hooks can bend or break with heavy use, so we recom-
mend using aluminum hooks for the standard sizes simply because they 
literally last forever — provided they don’t disappear.
 
✓ Steel hooks, which are the smallest of all crochet hooks, are used for 
crocheting with thread and fine yarns. They’re made of — wait for it — 
steel, and they measure about 5 inches in length and run from 0.75 mil-
limeters to 3.5 millimeters wide.
In crochet, you work each stitch until only one loop remains on the hook, 
so you don’t need a lot of space to hold loops (for the exception to the rule, 
check out the Tunisian stitch in Chapter 12). Therefore, the hooks are a con-
venient length, unlike the needles in our sister craft — knitting.
The size of a crochet hook refers to the thickness of the hook, which in turn 
determines the size of the stitches it creates. The photo in Figure 2-2 gives 
you an idea of the size variation in hooks. You can expect to run across three 
different systems for marking hook sizes:
 
✓ U.S. (American), which uses a letter/number combo
 
✓ Continental (metric), which uses millimeters
 
✓ UK (English), which uses numbers
 
For standard hooks using the U.S. or metric system, the higher the number 
or further the letter is in the alphabet, the larger the hook. For example, a D-3 
U.S. hook is smaller than a K-101⁄2 U.S. hook. For steel hooks, which use only 
a number designation, the opposite holds true. The higher the number, the 
smaller the hook. Fortunately, you don’t need to worry about keeping the dif-
ferent systems straight because hooks are usually labeled with both the U.S. 
letter/number designation as well as the numeric metric designation.

When shopping for crochet hooks, don’t be afraid to try out lots of differ-
ent brands and sizes. Hooks are inexpensive, and having extras of the most 
common sizes doesn’t hurt. Even after you’ve found the style that you’re 
comfortable with, hang on to other hooks you’ve collected as backups. You 
never know when you’re going to lose your favorite hook and urgently need a 
replacement!
Ten handy household uses for crochet hooks
If you thought that crochet hooks were just for 
crocheting, guess again. Here are some addi-
tional interesting uses for them:
 ✓ Pull a yarn snag to the inside of a sweater.
 ✓ Reweave a dropped stitch while knitting.
 ✓ Pull a drawstring through its casing.
 ✓ Fix a tangled necklace.
 ✓ Rescue a ring you dropped down the drain.
 ✓ Pull hair through the holes of the cap when 
highlighting your hair.
 ✓ Weave a potholder by using a loom.
 ✓ Weave anything through anything.
 ✓ Stake up a plant.
 ✓ Spear the last olive at the bottom of the jar.

Figuring Out Yarn Features 
and Functions
First things first: Forget about that scratchy, bulky yarn your grandmother 
used. The variety of yarn available today is astounding, to say the least. You 
can find everything from the basic solid-color acrylic yarns and silky-soft 
wool blends to long, fringy eyelash yarn and sequined yarn. In addition to 
going over yarn weights, styles, and materials, the sections that follow show 
you what to do with yarn packaging and labels and how to choose the right 
yarn for your projects.
Sizing up yarn weights
 
Yarn weight or size refers to the general thickness of a yarn and can range 
from very thin to superthick. You can describe the weight of a yarn in numer-
ous ways, but the majority of yarn companies tend to adhere to several 
common weight descriptions. The following list, although not all-inclusive, 
outlines the most common sizes of yarn in order from the thinnest to the 
thickest strands (check out Figure 2-3 to see how the different weights com-
pare visually):
 
✓ Lace weight: Lace weight yarns include crochet thread and tend to be 
very thin yarns commonly used for doilies, filet crochet, and shawls.
 
✓ Fingering weight: Also known as sock or baby weight, this thin yarn is 
generally used to make lightweight garments, baby items, and designs 
with an open and lacy pattern.
 
✓ Sport weight: This medium-weight yarn is great for many different types 
of patterns, including sweaters, baby blankets, scarves, and shawls.
 
✓ Double Knitting (DK) weight: Sometimes referred to as light worsted, 
this yarn is slightly thicker than sport weight and can be used in the 
same patterns, but the resulting fabric is somewhat heavier.
 
✓ Worsted weight: Worsted weight is probably the most commonly used 
size of yarn and also the most readily available. It’s great for afghans, 
sweaters, scarves, hats, slippers, and toys.
 
✓ Chunky weight: This yarn is sometimes referred to as heavy worsted or 
bulky weight. It’s thicker than worsted weight and is used for afghans, 
jackets, and rugs.
 
✓ Super bulky weight: This yarn is a very thick, warm yarn and is gener-
ally used to make jackets, afghans, rugs, and heavy outdoor sweaters.

In an attempt to provide a universally accepted classification of sizes, the 
Craft Yarn Council of America has developed the Standard Yarn Weight 
System, offering yarn weight symbols that represent the categories of yarn 
along with their common gauge ranges and recommended hook sizes. Many 
yarn manufacturers include the yarn weight symbols on the label to help you 
find suitable yarn substitutions. Figure 2-4 shows the symbols for lace, super 
fine, fine, light, medium, bulky, and super bulky weights (from 0 to 6).

Even though the different thicknesses of yarns are named by weight, as in wor-
sted weight or sport weight, the size (diameter) of the yarn is actually what 
that name is referring to. The terms size and weight are interchangeable when 
referring to the thickness of a yarn.

Checking out the different types of yarn
Yarns are made up of a wide variety of materials, ranging from natural fibers 
like wools, cottons, and silks to synthetics such as acrylic, rayon, and nylon. 
You can also find pretty much any combination or blend of these materials. We 
give you an overview of the different types of yarn in the following sections.
 
When choosing yarn for a project, take into consideration how you’ll use the 
piece. If you’re making a baby blanket, choose a yarn that can stand up to 
repeated washings. If you’re making a tablecloth or bedspread that’ll some-
day be an heirloom piece, invest in good-quality cotton that can withstand 
the test of time without falling apart. For a warm sweater, you can’t beat wool 
for durability and warmth. (Head to the later section “Matching your yarn to 
your project” for some additional tips on making an informed decision when 
picking out your yarn.)
Wool
Of all the natural fibers used to make yarn, wool is the most popular choice to 
work with when you’re creating a piece that you want to endure for years to 
come. Wool is resilient (which helps the stitches retain their shape), soft, easy 
to work with, and relatively lightweight. It comes in many different sizes, from 
fingering weight to bulky. You can crochet with wool to make everything from 
beautiful, warm-weather sweaters to cozy, wintertime pullovers, hats, scarves, 
mittens, socks, and afghans. Wool is fairly low maintenance as well, but be 
careful to read a particular yarn’s label for specific washing instructions.
Although most wool comes from various breeds of sheep, you can obtain luxu-
rious wool yarns from other animals as well. Fuzzy mohair and cashmere come 
from goats, and delicate, fluffy, Angora yarn comes from the Angora rabbit.
 
If you’re allergic to wool, don’t despair. Look for a synthetic instead. Many 
new synthetics mimic the real stuff so well that if you don’t spill your secret, 
no one will know.
Silk
Spun from the cocoon of the silkworm, silk yarn has a smooth, often shiny 
finish. It’s lightweight and absorbent, making it a perfect choice for warm-
weather garments. Silk is often combined with cotton or wool to increase its 
elasticity and durability.
Cotton
Once used mainly to make doilies, bedspreads, and tablecloths, cotton has 
become a versatile yarn. It comes in a wide range of sizes, from very fine 
threads to worsted-weight yarn. Garments made from cotton yarn are wash-
able, durable, and have that great cotton comfort. Cotton yarn is also a good 
choice for home décor items such as place mats, potholders, and curtains.

23
 Chapter 2: Tools of the Trade
Synthetics
Synthetic yarn is produced from man-made fibers such as acrylic, rayon, 
nylon, and polyester. Designed to look like the natural-fiber yarns, synthetic 
yarns are readily available in a wide range of sizes, colors, and textures and 
are generally less expensive than their natural counterparts. These yarns, 
especially those made from acrylic, are good for afghans and baby blankets 
because they require little care. (However, you should still be sure to check 
the label for washing instructions.) Synthetic yarns are quite often used in 
combination with natural fibers, which gives you even more new textures, 
colors, and qualities of yarn to crochet with.
Novelty yarns
Novelty yarns are fun and funky and make your pieces interesting without 
requiring complicated stitch patterns. From soft, fringy eyelash yarn and vel-
vety chenille to bumpy bouclé, glittering metallics, and slinky ribbon, these 
yarns can add a fresh, fashionable look to any piece you create. 
Organic yarns, fair trade fibers, and sustainably sourced fibers
Ecologically friendly yarns are a growing trend in the yarn world as crafters 
work to lessen their hobbies’ impact on the environment. Among the yarns 
found in this category are organic, fair trade, and sustainably sourced yarns. 
Organic yarns come from companies that make their products without the 
use of man-made chemicals, so plants and animals are raised without syn-
thetic pesticides or fertilizer. Fair trade fibers come from companies who 
work to improve labor conditions for their farmers and workers. Sustainably 
sourced yarns have been produced with minimal impact on the earth, mean-
ing the fiber is cultivated without excess waste of or damage to the earth’s 
resources.
Some major yarn brands and local yarn shops have added eco-friendly yarns 
to their line, but these still tend to be more expensive than other yarns. 
However, as more crafters support those brands that make a conscious effort 
to produce earth-friendly fibers, the more abundant and cheaper those fibers 
will become.
Other materials
If you’re feeling adventurous, you can crochet with any material that resem-
bles a string. Throw caution to the wind and use fine, colored wire and hemp 
to crochet cool jewelry, nylon cord to whip up waterproof bags and outdoor 
seat cushions, and even embroidery floss and sewing thread to create appli-
qués and accents. Check out Chapter 20 for ideas on how to crochet with 
cut-up strips of fabric or plastic grocery bags (gives a whole new meaning to 
“reduce, reuse, recycle,” huh?).

24
Part I: Crochet 101 
Sorting out yarn packaging
Yarn is commonly packaged (or put up) in three different ways: as a skein, 
a ball, or a hank. You can crochet with balls and skeins of yarn as you buy 
them. Hanks, however, require a bit of preparation.
 
✓ Ball: If your ball of yarn is wound around a cardboard center, just grab 
the end on the outside of the ball, and you’re ready to go. If the ball has 
an open center, your best bet is to find the end of the yarn from inside 
the ball. Using the inside end keeps the ball from rolling around the floor 
or becoming a new toy for your cat.
 
✓ Skein: The most common form of packaging, a skein is an oblong, 
machine-wound bundle of yarn. You start crocheting with the inside 
end. Sometimes it’s already pulled to the outside for you. In that case, 
just give it a tug, and it’ll pull out smoothly and evenly. If the yarn end 
isn’t visible at either end of the skein, reach into the small indentation 
on either end of the skein and pull out a few strands; you’ll find the end 
buried inside there. Sometimes the label has an arrow pointing to the 
correct end of the skein to pull from, but more often than not, you have 
to guess. If the first end doesn’t work, try the other end; it has to be in 
there somewhere! Working from the inside of the skein keeps the yarn 
tangle free.
 
✓ Hank: A hank is a large circle of yarn twisted into a figure-eight shape. 
Trying to work from a hank soon results in a tangled mess and plenty 
of frustration, so you need to first wind it into a ball. Unfold and then 
untwist the hank so that it’s a circle of yarn. Place the large circle of 
yarn over a chair back or your knees, or have someone hold it with out-
stretched arms. Find the outside end of the yarn and loosely wind it into 
a ball.
 
To wind a ball of yarn the inexpensive way, start by laying the outside end of 
the hank across three or four of your fingers. With the other hand, wrap the 
yarn loosely around those fingers about 20 times. Remove the wrapped yarn 
all at once, rotate it 90 degrees, and lay it across the same three or four fin-
gers of your hand. Wrap the yarn loosely around those fingers about 20 times. 
Remove the yarn from your hand, pinching it to keep it from unraveling, and 
rotate it 90 degrees. Continue to lay the yarn across your hand, wrap about 20 
times (more or less is fine), remove, and rotate. As you go, you’ll notice that 
the yarn begins to form a ball. After you make a ball, continue to wrap in one 
direction several times; then rotate the ball and continue wrapping until all of 
the yarn is in ball form.
 
Winding a ball too tightly can stretch your yarn, and you definitely don’t want 
that. Stretched-out yarn may spring back into shape when your work is fin-
ished, and you may have to hand down your size-12 sweater to your size-10 
daughter.

 Chapter 2: Tools of the Trade
Deciphering yarn labels
Yarn labels contain a lot of valuable information that you need to take note 
of to make sure your project turns out right. Check out the label in Figure 2-5 
and the following list for the lowdown on label info.
 
Figure 2-5: 
Identifying 
key 
information 
on a yarn 
label.
 
Yarn labels include most, if not all, of the following information:
 
✓ Article number (1): Some manufacturers assign a number to each differ-
ent type of yarn they produce for identification purposes. This number 
comes in handy when you’re ordering yarn directly from the manufac-
turer or another mail-order source.
 
✓ Brand name (2): A yarn company may manufacture several different 
types or brands of yarn.
 
✓ Care instructions (3): As with any item that needs to be cleaned, yarn 
has specific care instructions. Some yarns require little care; you simply 
throw them in the washer and dryer. Other yarns need some TLC and 
should be handwashed and laid flat to dry. Still others should be sent to 
the dry cleaner. Be sure that the care instructions will work well for your 
finished work, or else your creation may end up on the top shelf of the 
closet! Many manufacturers use the International Fabric Care Symbols 
shown here. For more information on these symbols, see Chapter 19.
 
 If you mix more than one type of yarn in a project, the care require-
ments should be similar. Otherwise you may end up with a stretched (or 
shrunken) section after you launder your piece the first time.
 
✓ Color name and number (4): Yarn colors are identified in two different 
ways: by name and/or number.
 
✓ Company name and logo (5): This is the name of the company that man-
ufactures the yarn. Sometimes contact information, such as address, 
telephone number, and Web site, is included as well.

26
Part I: Crochet 101 
 
✓ Dye lot number (6): The dye lot number identifies yarns that are dyed 
in the same batch. Although companies strive to match the colors as 
closely as possible, slight variations exist from lot to lot. Even if skeins 
of different dye lots look the same when you hold them together, you 
may end up with a distinct color difference in your finished project.
 
 To ensure an even color throughout your work, buy enough yarn from 
the same dye lot to complete your entire project. If you have to go back 
and buy more at a later date, chances are you won’t be able to find yarn 
from the same dye lot.
 
 If you do end up with skeins of the same color but different dye lots, 
here’s a trick to make the color variation less noticeable. If you have 
equal numbers of skeins in each dye lot, crochet two rows with a skein 
of one dye lot, and then crochet the next two rows with a skein from the 
second dye lot. Continue to switch skeins of each dye lot after every two 
rows to end up with a subtle striped pattern. If you only have one skein 
that has a different dye lot than the remaining skeins, you can still do 
the same thing, but you’ll want to work in the odd dye lot less frequently 
depending on how many skeins you have to work with.
 
✓ Gauge (7): Gauge is a measurement that helps you keep your crochet 
stitches consistent. It’s the number of stitches and rows in a given 
measurement that you should get with a particular yarn by using the 
recommended hook size for that yarn. If the label only gives a knitting 
gauge, you can use this gauge as a guide because crochet hook sizes cor-
respond to knitting needle sizes. Flip to Chapter 3 for more on gauge.
 
✓ Manufacturer’s address (8): Sometimes the manufacturer’s address is 
listed separately from the name, and it can come in handy if you have 
questions about the yarn or are having trouble locating a retail store 
that sells the product.
 
✓ Ply (9): Ply refers to the number of smaller strands twisted together to 
form the larger single strand of yarn. This number can be deceptive, 
though, because a fine yarn can be a 3- or 4-ply yarn, whereas a bulky 
yarn can be just 2 ply. Worsted-weight yarns are generally 4 ply, but 
some cotton yarns can be made up of 8 or more strands. The ply may 
be included on the label along with the size or weight of the yarn; for 
example, 4-ply worsted-weight yarn or 2-ply bulky-weight yarn.
 
✓ Recommended hook size (10): Sometimes the label suggests a certain 
hook size so you can work to the proper gauge for a specific yarn size. 
The recommended hook size is a good place to start, although you may 
find that you need to use a smaller- or larger-size hook, depending on 
how you work your stitches and how loose you want them to be. You can 
achieve a lacy texture by using a much larger hook than recommended. 
On the other hand, if you want a tight, stiff fabric (like for a tapestry bag), 
you should use a smaller hook than the one the label calls for.
 
✓ Weight (11): This number reflects the actual weight of the whole skein, 
ball, or hank of yarn, as opposed to the weight (size) of the yarn strand. 
The weight is usually quoted in ounces and/or grams.

27
 Chapter 2: Tools of the Trade
 
✓ Yardage (12): The yardage is the length of the yarn (in yards or meters) 
that’s in the ball or skein. This information is important because you 
don’t want to get partway through your project and then realize that you 
don’t have enough yarn.
 
✓ Yarn content (13): Yarn content is the stuff your yarn is made of — wool 
or acrylic, cotton or silk, a blend of two or more fibers, or one of the 
many other fibers available.
Matching your yarn to your project
When selecting yarn you must always take your project’s design, pattern, 
color, and texture into consideration. Certain patterns work better with simple 
yarns and solid colors; others can showcase more exotic yarns. The following 
sections offer advice for properly matching your yarn to your project.
Working with color and texture
A wide array of wonderfully colored yarns is available today, from bright, 
jewel-toned solids to hand-painted, variegated yarns. If your pattern is 
simple, try a multicolored yarn. Using colorful yarns allows you to create a 
beautiful work of art without having to work a more complex stitch pattern.
If you’ve chosen a design with fancier stitches, stick to a more basic yarn. A 
smooth, solid-color yarn adds definition to your stitches and allows them to 
stand out. Remember: You want your fancy stitch work to be seen! Today’s 
vibrant, solid yarn colors are available in both matte and shiny finishes. Both 
finishes work equally well, so choose the one you like best.
Working with novelty yarns (think eyelash yarn or fun fur) can be tricky because 
seeing the stitches as you’re crocheting is sometimes difficult. Don’t let this 
downside put you off; instead, plan to take more time and effort to work up your 
creation. When first working with novelty yarns, try using them as an accent to 
your piece in borders, edgings, and collars until you get used to them. This way, 
if you make a mistake, at least you won’t have to take your whole design apart. 
Besides, these novelty yarns can be overwhelming when used in excess.
 
The more intricate your stitch design is, the simpler your yarn should be. The 
more interesting the yarn is, the simpler the pattern should be.
Choosing natural or man-made fibers
When picking out your yarn, think about what your design will be used for. 
Soft wools and shimmery silks work beautifully for winter sweaters and 
dressy tops. High-quality cotton produces a wonderful summer cardigan or 
an heirloom doily, bedspread, or tablecloth. Natural fibers cost a little more 
and require more TLC than man-made fibers, but they hold up well over a 
long period of time.

28
Part I: Crochet 101 
If you’re making baby items or large designs, such as afghans, opt for a good-
quality synthetic yarn, such as acrylic. Made to mimic the natural fibers, syn-
thetic yarns come in a wide range of sizes and colors and can be smooth and soft 
to the touch. They’re also easy to care for. In most cases, they can be thrown 
in the washer and dryer and still stand up well to the wear and tear of everyday 
use. Synthetic yarns are usually cheaper than their natural counterparts, which 
is a good thing when you’re creating a design that uses a lot of yarn.
Substituting yarns
If you have your heart set on making the design exactly as you see it in the 
pattern picture, use the yarn listed in the pattern materials list. But if that 
gorgeous afghan is made in shades of pink and your décor is blue, don’t be 
afraid to change the color scheme. Or if your budget doesn’t accommodate 
the high-priced wool called for in that sweater design, look for a comparable 
synthetic or a less-expensive wool blend.
 
If you’re substituting for more than just color, however, make sure that the 
yarn you choose is the same size or weight and can accommodate the same 
gauge. (See Chapter 3 for details on gauge.) For example, if the pattern calls 
for a worsted-weight yarn, make sure you get another worsted-weight yarn. If 
you choose a bulky yarn instead, you’ll end up with a design that’s consider-
ably larger than planned. If you’re making something wearable, substitutions 
can cause disastrous results.
Another important consideration when substituting yarns is total yardage. If 
the pattern calls for five skeins of a sport-weight yarn that has 400 yards to 
each skein for a total of 2,000 yards, make sure you purchase enough of what-
ever sport-weight yarn you choose so that you have a total of 2,000 yards.
 
The manufacturer’s gauge on the yarn label can help when you want to substi-
tute one yarn for another. Just compare the gauge listed on the yarn label with 
the pattern gauge to determine the correct-size yarn to swap. We explain how 
to decipher a yarn label earlier in this chapter.
Creating your own yarn combinations
For even more variety, work with two or three different strands of yarn held 
together as one to create a unique blend of colors or textures. You can use 
two or more strands of the same weight of yarn to produce an extremely 
thick fabric (this is what those really big hooks are made for).
 
If you want to use several strands in a pattern that calls for only one, make 
sure the yarns you put together equal the same weight yarn that the pattern 
calls for. For example, if a design calls for a worsted-weight yarn, you can use 
two or three strands of a fingering-weight yarn because that would approxi-
mately equal a worsted weight. If you’re unable to come up with the correct 
weight, be sure to make a gauge swatch and adjust your hook size to achieve 
the proper gauge (see Chapter 3 for help).

29
 Chapter 2: Tools of the Trade
 
Note: Working with more than one strand of yarn at a time can be tricky. 
Watch out for all those extra loops of yarn that you’ll encounter.
Tool Time: Other Tools of the Trade
Although your crochet hook and yarn are your primary tools when crochet-
ing, several other items can come in handy. Some of these tools are neces-
sary; others, though not essential, are just nice to have.
 
You probably want to have a safe place to keep all of this neat new stuff you 
have. Most craft stores carry a variety of cases that you can use to store all of 
your crochet supplies. Consider storing smaller items in a small zippered case 
and placing it in a larger case or carrying bag along with your yarn.
Gathering basic tools
Several basic tools make crocheting easier. Some of our favorites include 
those in Figure 2-6. The following list describes each one, moving counter-
clockwise from the scissors:
 
✓ Scissors: Small scissors with a sharp point work best. They’re more man-
ageable than large scissors, and you’re less likely to snip at the wrong 
place. Craft and fabric stores carry a variety of scissors, and many come 
with carrying cases or are collapsible.
 
 Don’t try to break your yarn with your hands — doing so is almost 
impossible and can stretch your yarn and hurt your hands if you actu-
ally manage it.
 
✓ Ruler and tape measure: These tools are necessary when measuring 
for gauge (see Chapter 3) and for measuring your work in progress. Try 
to find a ruler and tape measure that feature both standard and metric 
measurements.
 
✓ Rustproof straight pins: These pins are absolutely necessary when 
pinning down a project that you’re going to block (meaning shape; 
see Chapter 19). After putting so much time into your project, it’d be 
a shame to ruin it by failing to use rustproof pins and ending up with 
reddish-brown spots throughout your creation.
 
✓ Safety pins: Safety pins have a gazillion uses, such as marking a spot in 
your work that you ripped out, holding two pieces together while sewing 
a seam, keeping track of increases and decreases, and marking the right 
side of your work.
 
 The safety pins without coils are the best. They slip in and out of your 
stitches easily, and the yarn doesn’t catch on them.

30
Part I: Crochet 101 
 
✓ Removable stitch markers: You can find a variety of stitch markers at 
your local yarn or craft store; however, you need to make sure you buy 
the kind that can be used with crochet. Knitting stitch markers are closed 
rings, but crochet stitch markers are removable. Be sure to look for mark-
ers that have a split; they’re often referred to as split stitch markers.
 
 Although removable stitch markers aren’t absolutely essential, having 
some type of marker comes in handy when you have to mark the end of 
a specific row or a certain stitch within the row where you’re going to 
work an increase or decrease. In a pinch, a piece of contrasting colored 
yarn, a safety pin, or a bobby pin works just as well.
 
✓ Yarn bobbins: These are usually plastic, and you use them to wrap dif-
ferent colors of yarn on when you’re working a multicolored piece. (See 
Chapter 9 for pointers on working with more than one color of yarn.)
 
✓ Yarn and tapestry needles: Yarn and tapestry needles have larger eyes 
than regular sewing needles to accommodate yarn. Yarn needles have a 
blunt point, which slips through the stitches without splitting the yarn. 
Tapestry needles are a bit smaller in diameter, have a sharper point, 
and are generally used when working with cotton thread. You use these 
needles often for weaving in ends, sewing motifs, or sewing seams.
 
 Yarn needles come in steel or plastic styles. Our preference is the steel 
variety because the plastic ones tend to bend and break over time.

 Chapter 2: Tools of the Trade
 
Don’t forget to keep a pad of paper and a pencil on hand. Keeping notes while 
you work is a must if you make any changes to a pattern or are designing your 
own piece. Even if you think you’ll remember the changes you made, write 
them down. The simplest, smallest stitch change can slip from your mind far 
faster than you may expect.
Treating yourself to little luxuries
The basic tools in the preceding section ensure that your crochet experience 
is more successful, but you can also invest in a few little luxuries that’ll make 
it more fun. Here are a few tools that aren’t absolutely necessary but can be a 
treat to have:
 
✓ Hook roll: After you’ve amassed a fair number of crochet hooks, you 
may want a case to help keep them organized. A hook roll has individual 
pockets for the hooks that make it easier to find the exact hook you 
need. Simply place the hooks in the pockets and roll up the case. You 
can purchase a hook roll for $10 to $20 at your local yarn shop or online.
 
✓ Yarn ball winder: A yarn ball winder can set you back about $40, but it 
makes winding yarn into balls much faster. Just secure one tail end of a 
hank or skein to the ball winder and turn the handle until all of the yarn 
has been wound into a neat little cake. This process takes just a couple 
minutes, and you end up with a string that’s ready to go from the center.
 
✓ Swift: Instead of relying on a friend or chair back to hold your yarn while 
you wind it into a ball, why not turn to a swift? Most swifts look a little 
like a rotating wooden umbrella. Simply unfold the hank, place it on the 
swift, and start winding. You can use a swift on its own or with a yarn 
ball winder. Either way, the cost of a swift ranges from $50 to $70.

Chapter 3
Creating Consistency with Gauge
In This Chapter
▶ Recognizing the value of gauge
▶ Whipping up a properly sized gauge swatch
▶ Setting gauge all on your own
M
aking sure your stitches are consistently the right size is very impor-
tant when crocheting, particularly when you’re whipping up cloth-
ing. (Otherwise, your sweater may be lopsided, or your scarf may morph 
into a table runner.) In order to get the shape and size you want, you must 
check the gauge provided in the pattern. Gauge is simply the ratio of a given 
number of stitches or rows to inches (or some other unit of measurement), 
such as seven stitches per inch or four rows per inch. You use this ratio to 
keep your stitches consistent and the size of your design on track. Working 
to the proper gauge ensures not only that the project you make is neat and 
attractive but also that the amount of yarn the pattern specifies is sufficient 
to complete the project.
This chapter shows you how to test your gauge by crocheting a gauge swatch 
(or sample) and how to adjust your gauge to equal the one that the pattern 
requires. We also explain how to set your own gauge (if that’s what you want 
to do).
Understanding Why You Should 
Bother with Gauge
Although you can certainly start a project without first checking your gauge, 
crocheting a gauge swatch so you can get a feel for the right ratio of stitches 
to inches is really important. If your gauge is off by even a little bit, your fin-
ished design may be off by several inches. If you don’t bother to check your 
gauge, you may spend beaucoup bucks on materials and many hours, days, 
or weeks crocheting only to find that the sweater you made is a perfect fit for 
the neighbor’s Chihuahua.

34
Part I: Crochet 101 
When you’re making a design from a published pattern, the pattern almost 
always recommends a gauge for you to follow. The pattern designer deter-
mines this gauge by taking into account the recommended yarn and hook 
size, the type of stitches used in the pattern, and the desired result.
 
Look for the recommended gauge at the beginning of the pattern instructions. (A 
subtle hint to check your gauge first thing!) Although garment patterns usually 
mention both a stitch and a row gauge, the stitch gauge is the most important 
one to match. It determines the width of each piece of the design, which, when 
you sew the front and back together, adds up to the finished bust measurement.
For example, say you’re making a sweater and the required gauge is 8 stitches 
= 2 inches, and you want a finished bust measurement of 40 inches (or 20 
inches across the back). The pattern may call for 80 stitches across the back 
(80 stitches ÷ 8 stitches × 2 inches = 20 inches). If your gauge measures 7 
stitches = 2 inches, then working 80 stitches ÷ 7 stitches × 2 inches = 22 inches. 
Your sweater back would therefore measure 22 inches, and the finished bust 
would measure 44 inches! See how having your gauge off by just 1 stitch can 
make your garment a much different size than what you intended? In this case, 
the finished sweater would be 4 whole inches larger than intended.
 
Many sweater patterns allow for your row gauge being off a little by telling you 
to work to the desired length in inches, regardless of how many rows it takes 
you to get there. However, if your stitch gauge is off, your sweater may be too 
wide or too narrow, and that’s something you can’t adjust without tearing out 
all of your hard work and at least some of your hair.
Note: The yarn manufacturer may also recommend a particular gauge on the 
yarn label. This gauge may be quite different from the one in your pattern, 
but that’s okay. Sometimes, the pattern designer wants to create a looser 
or tighter stitch pattern than the standard that the yarn manufacturer set. 
Follow the pattern gauge to get the same results as the pictured project.
Working a Gauge Swatch
Working a gauge swatch may seem like a waste of valuable crocheting time, but 
it’s worth the effort. In addition to making sure your stitches and rows are the 
same size as the pattern’s (which ensures a perfect-fitting garment), a gauge 
swatch lets you practice any new stitches found in the pattern and become 
familiar with the yarn you’re using. In the next sections, we explain how to 
create and block a swatch of the right size, how to measure stitches in relation 
to rows and rounds, and how to correct your gauge with additional swatches.

35
 Chapter 3: Creating Consistency with Gauge
Making your swatch the right size
Different types of patterns call for different types of gauges. A simple pattern 
that uses just one stitch, like a single crochet stitch, states the gauge as a 
certain number of stitches and rows per a given number of inches. However, 
some patterns have a set of several different stitches that repeats across the 
row. In this case, the pattern states the gauge as one entire stitch repeat per 
a given number of inches.
Work the stitches for your gauge swatch according to the instructions in the 
pattern. However, you probably want to make it bigger than what the instruc-
tions specify in order to get an accurate measurement.
 
Crocheters tend to crochet tighter at the beginning and end of rows than in 
the body of their work. So multiply the inches indicated in the stitch gauge 
by the inches indicated in the row gauge to figure out how big to make your 
swatch. For example, if the gauge calls for 7 stitches = 2 inches and 8 rows = 2 
inches, make your swatch at least 4 inches square. That way you can measure 
in the center of the swatch and get an accurate measurement of your normal 
pace. If you’re working a gauge that has a repeated set of stitches, you may 
need to make it bigger than 4 inches square.
Note: The swatches pictured in this chapter are made up of two colors so 
you can better identify the center stitches, but you can just use a single color 
when working your own gauge swatches.
Putting swatches to good use
Although you may feel a little impatient when 
you have to spend your time crocheting a gauge 
swatch, you can make that time and effort seem 
less painful if you find a use for all of those 
practice swatches. Following are a few ideas:
 ✓ Use them as coasters.
 ✓ Make a swatch large enough to use as a 
doll blanket.
 ✓ Sew several swatches together to form a 
pillow front or wall hanging sampler.
 ✓ Sew many swatches together to make a 
patchwork afghan.
 ✓ Keep a scrapbook of your swatches to 
inspire future projects.
 ✓ Practice edgings and borders on the sides 
of your swatches.
 ✓ Use lacy cotton swatches as appliqués on 
sweatshirts or jeans.

36
Part I: Crochet 101 
Blocking your swatch
To get an accurate measurement of your stitches, you have to treat your swatch 
just as you plan to treat your finished project. Check to see whether your pattern 
requires you to block your final design. Blocking is a process that evens out the 
stitches and gets the final piece into the right shape. It usually involves getting 
the piece wet, whether you submerge it in a tub of water or just steam it, and 
then shaping the piece by hand into the correct measurements and allowing it to 
dry. After blocking your gauge swatch, you can measure your true gauge, there-
fore accurately predicting whether your finished design will be true to form. (See 
Chapter 19 to find out how to block your work.)
 
Blocking your gauge swatch is especially important if you’re working with 
natural fibers, such as wool and cotton.
Measuring stitches and rows
After you make (and possibly block) a gauge swatch with the materials and 
hook size that the pattern recommends, measure the stitches and rows in 
your swatch to determine whether you have too many, too few, or just the 
right number for the given gauge.
Measuring a swatch of single crochet
The following swatches show you how to correctly measure gauge in a fabric 
made up of single crochet stitches (see Chapter 5 for instructions on single 
crochet). Figure 3-1a shows that you have 7 stitches in 2 inches. Figure 3-1b 
shows that 8 rows of single crochet = 2 inches.

 Chapter 3: Creating Consistency with Gauge
Measuring a swatch made with a repeating pattern
Figure 3-2 shows you how to measure crocheted fabric that uses different 
stitches, worked in rows.
 
✓ When measuring a stitch gauge in a swatch that has a repeating pattern 
of combination stitches, be sure to include the total repeat in your mea-
surement. Figure 3-2a points out each shell for the repeating shell pat-
tern; the width of 2 shells is 31⁄4 inches.
 
✓ When measuring a row gauge, always measure the rows from the base 
of one row to the base of another row above it. If you measure to the 
top of a row, your gauge will be off because the base of the row lies in 
the valley of the previous row. Figure 3-2b points out each shell for the 
repeating pattern and shows that 4 rows in the shell pattern is equal to 
21⁄4 inches high.

When working with a pattern such as the one in Figure 3-2, the gauge usually 
includes one or more repeats of the pattern, so you need to make a swatch 
that’s at least 2 inches wider and taller than the number of inches indicated 
in the stitch gauge. For example, if the stitch gauge = 31⁄4 inches, you need to 
work a swatch at least 51⁄4 inches wide to get an accurate gauge. The row gauge 
for a pattern that has a 2-row repeat, such as this one, should be a multiple of 
2 rows (2, 4, or 6 rows) to reflect how the pattern will work up in length. For 
example, the gauge for this pattern is 4 rows = 21⁄4 inches. For an accurate row 
gauge, work a swatch at least 6 rows deep, or approximately 31⁄2 inches.
Measuring stitches and rounds
If you’re working a round (stitches crocheted in a circle rather than rows; 
see Chapter 8 for details), such as with a doily, you figure out the gauge by 

38
Part I: Crochet 101 
measuring the diameter of the swatch after you’ve made a certain number of 
rounds. The pattern usually states how many rounds to make for the swatch; 
look for verbiage along the lines of “First X rounds = X inches.” Figure 3-3a 
shows 3 rounds of double crochet stitches that equal 31⁄2 inches in diameter. 
Figure 3-3b shows the first 2 rounds of a hexagon motif that equal 3 inches in 
diameter across the widest point.

If you’re crocheting with cotton thread in rounds (or rows, for that matter), 
you can usually use a smaller gauge swatch than when you crochet with yarn, 
but you take the measurements the same way no matter what material or 
hook size you’re using.
Over- or undershooting the mark
If your gauge is different from the one the pattern specifies, you can correct it 
by changing hook sizes and making another swatch.
 
✓ If you have more stitches than the pattern calls for, your work is too 
tight, and you should make another swatch with a larger hook.
 
✓ If you have fewer stitches than the pattern calls for, you’re working 
too loosely, and you need to use a smaller hook to achieve the desired 
result. Figure 3-4 shows what a swatch looks like if you crochet too 
loosely (or if you use too large a hook) for a desired stitch gauge of 6 
stitches in 2 inches. Notice how the white center section exceeds the 
required 2-inch gauge.
In either situation, keep adjusting hook sizes and working swatches until you 
get the right gauge.

Everyone crochets a little differently. After you get to know your own crochet 
style (whether you tend to crochet tightly or loosely), you may be able to 
choose the proper hook size even before making the first swatch for a pattern. 
Changing hook size is the best way to compensate for your individual style of 
crochet. If you consciously try to tighten or loosen up your stitches to achieve 
the proper gauge, you invariably return to your natural style as you go along 
and then wind up with the wrong gauge.
 
If you don’t work on a project for several days or weeks or months, be sure to 
recheck your gauge before continuing with the project. Time away can affect 
your gauge, which varies depending on your stress level and other outside fac-
tors. You may need to adjust your hook size to maintain the original gauge.
Flying Solo: Establishing 
Your Own Gauge
 
After you get the hang of crocheting, you may want to try designing your own 
sweaters, scarves, and afghans. Suppose you have a stitch pattern in mind and 
you want to figure out how many stitches to work to create the size that you 
need — in other words, you want to set the right gauge for your project. The 
following steps make it easy:
 
1. Work a swatch of the pattern using the desired materials.
 
2. Change hook sizes as needed until the swatch has the look and feel 
you want.
 
3. Measure how many stitches your swatch has per inch (or several inches).

40
Part I: Crochet 101 
For example, if your gauge measures 7 stitches = 2 inches and you want to 
make a sweater that measures 36 inches around, or 18 inches across the 
back, cross multiply to calculate the correct number of stitches (x) you need 
to begin the back. Remember cross multiplication from elementary school? 
In order to find x, you first multiply 7 by 18. Then you divide that answer 
by 2. So in this case you have 7 × 18 = 126 and 126 ÷ 2 = 63 stitches. Working 
63 stitches produces a back width of 18 inches.
 
Never skip over the gauge stage when you create your own crochet master-
pieces. The gauge swatch is a necessary tool for creating a useful and beautiful 
work of art.

Chapter 4
Decoding Crochet Patterns
In This Chapter
▶ Getting familiar with the various sections in crochet patterns
▶ Reading written pattern instructions
▶ Recognizing stitch symbols and diagrams as instructions
S
ometimes you may work thousands of stitches for one crochet project. 
If crochet instructions were all written out, stitch by stitch by stitch 
without any abbreviations or shortcuts, one pattern would fill an entire book. 
Fortunately, crochet instructions have their own special abbreviations and a 
form of shorthand that simplify the written directions, saving space and a lot 
of tedious reading time.
Some patterns also use the International Crochet Symbols (see Figure 4-1 
later in this chapter) to create pictorial diagrams of a crocheted design. You 
may find these diagrams easier to follow than the text when dealing with 
intricate patterns.
After you get a handle on the abbreviations and symbols of crochet design, 
reading a crochet pattern is a cinch. In this chapter, we help you decipher 
the unique language of crochet instructions.
Note: If you’re reading this book in order, note that the stitches are explained 
in order of complexity. If you want to know right away what a double crochet 
or popcorn stitch is, head to the table of contents or the index to find the 
related chapter.
Breaking Down the Sections 
of a Crochet Pattern
 
Most crochet patterns found in magazines or books have several different sec-
tions that you must be familiar with if you want to concentrate on crocheting 
your masterpiece rather than deciphering the instructions for it. The following 

42
Part I: Crochet 101 
list introduces the most common pattern sections (some patterns will have 
more; others will have fewer):
 
✓ Level of experience: Most patterns give you a general idea of the com-
plexity of the pattern and whether it’s suitable for a beginner, advanced 
beginner, intermediate crocheter, or advanced crocheter. Don’t auto-
matically shy away from a supposedly advanced pattern, though. Take a 
look at it before deciding that it’s too complex for your ability.
 
✓ Materials: The materials section lists everything you need to complete 
the project, specifically
 
• Yarn: The yarn section of the materials list tells you all you need 
to know to get the right yarn for the project: the brand name, the 
specific yarn name, the fiber composition of the yarn, the size of 
the yarn (such as sport weight or worsted weight), the weight and 
yardage of each skein, and how many skeins (or hanks or balls) 
you need. (See Chapter 2 for the full scoop on yarn and how to 
read those pesky labels.)
 
• Hook: The next item in the list is the size crochet hook (or hooks) 
you need.
 
• Additional materials: The materials list also includes any addi-
tional materials you need, such as a yarn needle, sewing thread, 
buttons, or beads.
 
✓ Size information: This part tells you the finished dimensions of the 
project. If you’re making a garment, this part gives you the size ranges 
(check out Chapter 16 for details on sweater sizing). It may also include 
a schematic, which is a diagram showing the dimensions of each piece 
used to make up the finished design.
 
✓ Gauge: The pattern gives the gauge for a design, each and every time. 
Always work to the specified gauge so you wind up with the right size 
design. (Check out Chapter 3 for information on gauge.)
 
✓ Stitches: Most patterns list the stitches used and give directions for any 
advanced stitches or techniques.
 
✓ Crocheting directions: The bulk of the pattern is the step-by-step 
instructions for crocheting the design. They may be written out row by 
row (or round by round), or they may include a pictorial diagram as well. 
If you’re supposed to crochet the project in several pieces, the pattern 
gives instructions for each piece. If keeping track of the right and wrong 
sides of a project is important for a certain pattern, the instructions 
designate which row is which. For example, if the first row of the work 
is the right side, the instructions for the first row appear like this: Row 1 
(RS). All subsequent odd-numbered rows are then considered right side, 
and even-numbered rows are considered wrong side. (See the later sec-
tions “Figuring Out Written Instructions” and “Not Just a Pretty Picture: 
Symbols and Diagrams” for the nitty-gritty details of reading directions.)

43
 Chapter 4: Decoding Crochet Patterns
 
✓ Assembly: If a design is made in several pieces, this section shows you 
how to put it all together.
 
✓ Finishing: Here’s where you add the final details, which can be as simple 
as sewing on buttons or as complex as adding borders and collars. If an 
item needs to be blocked, you find the specifics on that task here (refer 
to Chapter 19 for more on blocking).
Figuring Out Written Instructions
Written instructions are, by far, the most common way to present a crochet 
pattern. The various abbreviations and symbols — and combinations of the 
two — may seem like a foreign language to you in the beginning. That’s okay. 
Consider the following sections your Crochet Dictionary. They explain each 
of the parts used in written instructions and how they all fit together.
Keeping it short with abbreviations
Most crochet stitches have shortened names or abbreviations. For example, 
instead of saying double crochet stitch throughout a pattern, the instructions 
abbreviate this stitch as dc. As we introduce terms and stitches throughout 
this book, we also give you their abbreviations to help you become familiar 
with the shorthand. Table 4-1 lists the most common abbreviations (they 
include stitches and other pertinent information).

Crochet abbreviations don’t have periods after them in order to keep the 
instructions as clutter free as possible. If you do come across a period that 
isn’t at the end of the sentence or action, it’s probably attached to an abbre-
viation that’s easily confused with another word. For instance, you may see 
inches abbreviated as in. to avoid confusion with in the word.
One other notation that you see quite frequently in pattern instructions is 
the hyphen. Instructions commonly use the hyphen when referring to a chain 
loop; the hyphen denotes the number of chains you work to create a par-
ticular loop. For example, a ch-5 loop is a loop made up of five chain stitches. 
Don’t confuse this instruction, however, with ch 5, which instructs you to 
make a chain of five chain stitches in a row.

45
 Chapter 4: Decoding Crochet Patterns
Some patterns combine several basic stitches into a more complex stitch. For 
example, five double crochet stitches worked in the same stitch are collec-
tively known as a shell because the result resembles the shape of a clamshell. 
Besides having their own names, these special stitches may also have their 
own abbreviations. (Chapter 10 defines many of these combination stitches 
and gives you their abbreviations.)
 
Special stitches aren’t standardized and may have different definitions in each 
pattern that you encounter. For example, one pattern may define a shell as 
five double crochet stitches, but another pattern may define it as only three 
double crochet stitches. Before diving into a new project, be sure to check the 
beginning of the pattern’s instructions for the definition of each special stitch.
Distinguishing between American and 
British crochet terminology
Just as hook sizes differ depending on where 
you live (as explained in Chapter 2), the crochet 
terminology used in the United States is differ-
ent than that used in the United Kingdom and 
Australia. For example, what’s called a single 
crochet in the United States is called a double 
crochet in the United Kingdom.
No one is entirely sure how this different cro-
chet terminology came about, but one theory 
is that the UK terms refer to the number of 
loops you have on the hook after you draw a 
loop through the next stitch and that the U.S. 
terms refer to the number of times you move the 
hook to complete the stitch. For example, after 
you’ve drawn the yarn through the stitch in the 
previous row, you have two loops on your hook, 
or a double loop, hence the United Kingdom’s 
double crochet. To complete the stitch, you only 
have to draw the yarn through both loops on the 
hook once, which is a single movement, hence 
the United States’ single crochet.
Following is a breakdown of what certain 
stitches are called in the United States and 
what they go by in the United Kingdom:
U.S. Stitch Name
UK Stitch Name
Single crochet (sc)
Double crochet (dc)
Double crochet (dc)
Treble (tr)
Half double crochet 
(hdc)
Half treble (htr)
Triple crochet (trc)
Double treble (dtr)
Slip stitch (sl st)
single crochet (sc)
The bottom line: Unless a pattern comes from 
the United Kingdom or Australia, or it specifi-
cally states that it’s using UK terminology, go 
ahead and assume it’s written using the U.S. 
crochet terms we explain in this book.

Part I: Crochet 101 
Working terms and phrases
Crochet patterns often contain jargon that isn’t abbreviated, such as the 
following terms that explain where and how to work stitches:
 
✓ Loop: A loop is three or more chain stitches worked in a row. To work 
in a loop, insert your hook into the hole underneath the loop, not in any 
one stitch, and then complete the stitch indicated.
 
✓ Space: Usually, a space refers to the space created by working one or 
more chain stitches in between other stitches. To work in the space, 
insert your hook into the hole underneath the chain stitches and 
complete the stitch indicated.
 
✓ Work across: Crochet the designated stitch or stitches across the whole 
length of the row.
 
✓ Work around: When working in rounds, crochet the same stitch or 
stitch pattern repeatedly until you come back to the starting point.
 
✓ Work across (or around) to within last 2 sts: Crochet the designated 
stitches until you have two stitches left to work in at the end of the row 
or round; the instructions tell you what to do in the last two stitches.
Pondering parentheses
Instead of detailing each and every stitch or action involved in a row or round, 
instruction writers use parentheses to designate a repeated set of actions and 
stitches or to sum up a row. Here’s a list of the different reasons instruction 
writers use these handy little arcs:
 
✓ To isolate a set of two or more stitches that you work all in one stitch: 
For example, you may find something like
 
 (2 dc, ch 2, 2 dc) in next sc
 
 This notation means that in the next single crochet stitch, you want 
to crochet two double crochet stitches, chain two, and then work two 
more double crochet stitches.
 
✓ To enclose a set of stitches that you repeat a number of times in 
succession: For example:
 
 (dc in next 3 sts, ch 2, skip next 2 sts) twice
 
 In plain English, this notation means that you work a double crochet 
stitch in each of the next three stitches, chain two, skip the next two 
stitches, and then repeat that by working a double crochet stitch in 
each of the next three stitches, chaining two, and skipping the next two 
stitches again.

47
 Chapter 4: Decoding Crochet Patterns
 
✓ To sum up a completed row or round: If you see (16 dc) at the end of 
the instructions for a row, you should have 16 double crochet stitches in 
that row. Likewise, (8 loops) means you’ve completed eight loops, and 
(4 ch-3 loops made) means you’ve made four loops that are each three 
chain stitches long.
 
✓ To distinguish different sizes in a garment pattern: If a garment pattern 
is written for three sizes, it includes separate instructions for the two 
larger sizes in parentheses. For example:
 
 dc in each of next 10 (12, 14) sts
 
 So you work 10 double crochet stitches if you’re going for the small size, 
12 double crochet stitches for medium, and 14 double crochet stitches 
for large.
 
 To make a pattern with multiple sizes listed easier to follow, you may 
want to highlight, underline, or circle the numbers that pertain to your 
desired size throughout the pattern.
Bracing yourself for brackets
Crochet instructions use brackets in the following ways:
 
✓ Some patterns use brackets interchangeably with parentheses to 
isolate repeated phrases of stitches. They may also appear as a set or 
phrase within another set of brackets or parentheses. For example:
 
 (2 dc, ch 5, sl st in fifth ch from hook forming a ring, [4 sc, ch 3, 4 
sc] in ring just made, 2 dc) in next ch-2 space
 
 In other words, start by working two double crochet stitches in the 
chain-2 space. Next, chain five stitches and slip stitch in the fifth chain 
from the hook to form a ring. Then work four single crochet stitches, 
chain three, and work four single crochet stitches again in the ring 
you just formed. Finally, complete the operation by working two more 
double crochet stitches in the same chain-2 space you started out in.
 
✓ Patterns use brackets within parentheses to sum up the number of 
stitches for different sizes. So to sum up the number of stitches in each 
size, a numeric phrase at the end of a row in a sweater pattern might say
 
 (72 [76, 80] sts)
 
 This notation means that when you reach the end of the row, you’ve 
worked a total of 72 stitches for a small-size sweater, 76 for a medium, 
and 80 for a large.

Part I: Crochet 101 
Interpreting special symbols 
in written patterns
Patterns use symbols such as bullets (•), asterisks (*), plus signs (+), and 
crosses (✝) in instructions to show the repetition of a series of crochet stitches. 
Bullets and asterisks are the most common symbols, but the symbol you see 
in a particular pattern really depends on the preference of the publication. 
This book uses only asterisks.
In the sections that follow, we describe the use of symbols in written pat-
terns. You most often see just one symbol or two symbols used.
Using one symbol
Some patterns use only one symbol at the beginning of a phrase and then 
direct you to repeat from that symbol a designated number of times. Here’s 
an example of what we mean:
* Dc in each of the next 3 sts, ch 2, skip next 2 sts; rep from * 5 times.
In this example, you work all the information after the asterisk once and then 
repeat the same series of steps five more times for a total of six times in all.
You may also see asterisks marking both the beginning and end of a repeated 
phrase. The instructions may reference this repeat again if the phrase within 
the asterisks is used at a different section of the row or round. Check out this 
example:
Ch 3, * dc in each of next 3 dc, ch 2, skip next 2 sts *; rep from * to * 
once, dc in each of next 6 sts, ch 2, skip next 2 sts; rep from * to * twice, 
dc in each of last 4 dc.
Just to make sure you’re interpreting Crochetese properly, check out the fol-
lowing plain-English translation of the preceding example and see whether it 
jives with your understanding of the abbreviated instructions:
 
1. Chain 3.
 
2. Double crochet stitch in each of the next 3 double crochet stitches, 
chain 2, and skip the next 2 stitches.
 
3. Repeat Step 2.
 
4. Double crochet stitch in each of the next 6 stitches, chain 2, and skip 
the next 2 stitches.
 
5. Repeat Step 2 twice.
 
6. Double crochet stitch in each of the last 4 double crochet stitches.

49
 Chapter 4: Decoding Crochet Patterns
Using two sets of symbols
In more complicated patterns, you may see two sets of symbols, such as 
single asterisks (*) and double asterisks (**), to designate two different 
repeats in the same row or round.
* Dc in dc, ch 2, skip next 2 sts *; rep from * to * 3 times, ** dc in next dc, 
2 dc in next space **; rep from ** to ** 3 times.
In plain English, this notation means you need to
 
1. Double crochet stitch in the double crochet stitch, chain 2, and then 
skip the next 2 stitches.
 
2. Repeat Step 1 three times.
 
3. Double crochet stitch in the next double crochet stitch and then work 
2 double crochet stitches in the following space.
 
4. Repeat Step 3 three times.
On the other hand, you may find the single asterisk phrase within the double 
asterisk phrase, denoting a repeated phrase within the larger set of repeated 
instructions. See for yourself in this example:
** 5 dc in loop, ch 2, skip next 2 dc, * dc in next dc, ch 2, skip next 2 dc *; 
rep from * to * 5 times **; rep from ** to ** 3 times.
In this case, you work the ** to ** phrase a total of 4 times to go around the 
entire piece, but within that phrase is another * to * phrase that you work a 
total of 6 times within each ** to ** repeat.
Confused? Here’s the rundown in plain English:
 
1. Work 5 double crochet stitches in the loop, chain 2, and then skip the 
next 2 double crochet stitches.
 
2. Work 1 double crochet stitch into the next double crochet stitch, 
chain 2, and then skip the next 2 double crochet stitches.
 
3. Repeat Step 2 five times, which brings you to the next loop.
 
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 three times.
Repeating rows and rounds
Sometimes a pattern includes several identical rows or rounds. To save 
space, the instructions may group these rows together and write out the 
directions only once, as follows:
Rows 2–7: Ch 1, sc in each sc across, turn.

50
Part I: Crochet 101 
This notation means you chain one, single crochet stitch into each single 
crochet stitch across the row, and then turn to complete one row. However, 
you work this row of single crochet consecutively for Rows 2 through 7 (for a 
total of six rows).
If you’re to repeat two (or more) different rows in the same order, you’ll see 
the first two rows written out and then the subsequent rows written as a 
repeat, as follows:
Row 2: Ch 1, sc in each st across, turn.
Row 3: Ch 3 (turning ch for dc), dc in each sc across, turn.
Rows 4–9: Rep Rows 2–3 (3 times).
So for Row 2, you chain one, single crochet in each stitch across the row, and 
then turn your work. For Row 3, you chain three, double crochet into each 
single crochet stitch across the row, and turn. Then you go back and work 
Row 2 again and then Row 3, repeating Row 2 and Row 3 consecutively until 
you’ve worked them a total of four times each.
Not Just a Pretty Picture: Stitch 
Symbols and Diagrams
Some pattern books and crochet magazines give you a pictorial description of
the pattern design — a picture that may or may not have written directions 
alongside it. These stitch diagrams are like a road map of the pattern, laying 
out each individual stitch in relation to the others so you get the forest and 
the trees at once.
 
The advantages of stitch diagrams are numerous:
 
✓ You can see the number and placement of the stitches at a glance.
 
✓ You can observe what the design should look like so that if your creation 
doesn’t resemble the diagram, you can easily identify your mistake.
 
✓ You can highlight or outline the repeated pattern in each row or round 
to make it easy to follow.
 
✓ You can mark where you leave off when you put your work down so you 
know where to begin the next time you crochet.
The beauty of stitch diagrams is that anyone can read them, regardless of 
what language he or she speaks. That’s why the individual stitch symbols 
that make up the diagrams are called International Crochet Symbols. So, if you 

51
 Chapter 4: Decoding Crochet Patterns
come across a terrific pattern in a Japanese book, you can make it from the 
diagram. Although these symbols and diagrams may look like hieroglyphics 
to you now, you’ll be reading them as naturally as you read this sentence 
after reviewing the following sections.
Cracking the International 
Crochet Symbols code
Although they’re called International Crochet Symbols, the symbols for 
crochet stitches aren’t universally accepted yet, which means you may find 
slight variations in different publications. Nonetheless, we compiled a list 
of standard symbols (see Figure 4-1) that we use consistently throughout 
this book; these are the symbols for the most common crochet stitches. We 
include the symbols for more advanced stitches in their respective chapters.
 
Each symbol roughly resembles the shape and proportions of the stitch that 
it represents. The number of tick marks drawn diagonally across the middle of 
the symbols indicates the number of times that you yarn over at the beginning 
of the stitch. For example, the double crochet has one tick mark (yarn over 
once), the triple crochet has two tick marks (yarn over twice), and so on.

Following a stitch diagram
The preceding section introduces you to the individual stitch symbols and 
what they look like. In this section, we combine all the symbols to create a 
stitch diagram like you’d see in a pattern. Then we deconstruct the diagram 
for you in plain English.
Getting a grip on stitch diagram fundamentals
 
Here’s a quick rundown of the basics you should know before you read a 
stitch diagram:
 
✓ Each row or round in a diagram is numbered so that you know where to 
begin — Row 1.
 
✓ On a pattern done in rounds, the numeral in the center of the beginning 
ring indicates the number of chain stitches in the center ring.
 
✓ Because most crochet instructions are repetitive and most publications 
have limited space, a diagram may show a repeated set of stitches just 
a few times. But those few repeats are all you need to crochet the entire 
piece.
 
✓ When working in rows, the right-side row number is placed on the right-
hand side of the diagram, which means you work from the right side to 
the left side. On wrong-side rows, the number is on the left-hand side, so 
you follow the diagram from left to right.
 
✓ When working in rounds, you read the diagram counterclockwise, with-
out turning between rows unless the instructions specifically tell you to 
do so.
 
✓ Stitch diagrams are generally laid out from the right-handed crocheter’s 
point of view, but a left-handed crocheter can read them just as well if 
he or she reverses the direction of the pattern and works from left to 
right rather than right to left. To work in rounds, a lefty still follows the 
pattern counterclockwise, but he or she works the piece clockwise, thus 
reversing the direction of the pattern.
 
✓ Because crochet is somewhat three-dimensional, the two-dimensional 
stitch diagram has some limitations. So if a pattern also has written 
instructions, you want to check those out as well.
Translating a stitch diagram into written instructions
Now it’s time to try your hand at reading an actual stitch diagram. The one 
in Figure 4-2 is for a lacy pattern that you work in rows. (To try out a stitch 
diagram for a design in rounds, head to Chapter 8.) Notice that this particu-
lar stitch diagram doesn’t look complete. Because this pattern is worked in 
identical rows consisting of repeated sets of stitches (the eight-stitch repeat 

53
 Chapter 4: Decoding Crochet Patterns
in each row is shaded), the diagram shows only a few rows to save space. 
Remember: The pattern will always tell you how many rows to make to get 
the exact result it shows.
 
If you want to go your own way and make a piece wider, narrower, longer, or 
shorter than the pattern specifies — for example, a runner that’s 12 inches 
wide or a tablecloth that’s 52 inches wide — just add more sets of repeats to 
each row and add more rows.

To begin this design, you make a foundation chain (represented by the row 
of oval chain stitch symbols at the bottom of Figure 4-2) that’s about the 
width you want, making sure it’s a multiple of eight stitches (to allow for the 
repeat). Then you chain two more for the end of the row plus three more 
for the turning chain for the first double crochet of Row 1. For example, you 
could start with 21 chain stitches (2 × 8 + 2 + 3 = 21) or 85 chain stitches (10 × 
8 + 2 + 3 = 85). Figure 4-2 starts with 29 chain stitches (3 × 8 + 2 + 3 = 29).
The following steps take you from Row 1 to the last row. The Crochetese 
appears first, but it’s followed by the plain-English translation so you can see 
how the written instructions correspond to the visual diagram. Figure 4-3 
shows you what the piece should look like when you’re done.

 Double crochet stitch in the fourth chain from the hook, double crochet 
in each chain going across, and then turn.

 For Row 2, chain 3 to make the turning chain for the first double crochet 
stitch and double crochet in each of the next 2 double crochet stitches. 
For the repeated part of this row (the instructions that are shown 
between the asterisks), skip the next 2 double crochet stitches, work 2 
double crochet stitches into the next double crochet, chain 1, work 2 
more double crochet stitches in the same double crochet, skip the next 2 
double crochet stitches, and then work 1 double crochet in each of the 
next 3 double crochet stitches. Repeat this section until you reach the end 
of the row, ending with a double crochet in the top of the previous row’s 
turning chain. Turn your work.
 
3. Row 3: Ch 3 (turning ch for first dc), dc in each of next 2 dc, * ch 1,

 To complete Row 3, chain 3 for your turning chain and then work 1 
double crochet stitch in each of the next 2 double crochet stitches. For 
the repeated part of this row (the instructions that are shown between 
the asterisks), chain 1, skip the next 2 double crochet stitches, work 3 
double crochet stitches in the next chain-1 space, chain 1, skip the 
next 2 double crochet stitches, and then work 1 double crochet stitch 
in each of the next 3 double crochet stitches. Repeat this section until 
you reach the end of the row, ending with a double crochet in the top 
of the previous row’s turning chain. Turn your work.
 
4. Row 4: Ch 3 (turning ch for first dc), dc in each of next 2 dc, * skip

next 3 dc *; rep from * to * across, ending with last dc of last rep in 
top of turning ch, turn.
 
 To complete Row 4, chain 3 for your turning chain and then work 1 
double crochet stitch into each of the next 2 double crochet stitches. 
For the repeated part of this row (the instructions shown between the 
asterisks), skip the next chain-1 space and the next double crochet 
stitch, work 2 double crochet stitches, chain 1, work 2 more double cro-
chet stitches into the next double crochet stitch, skip the next double 
crochet stitch and the next chain-1 space, and then work 1 double cro-
chet stitch into each of the next 3 double crochet stitches. Repeat this 
section until you reach the end of the row, ending with a double crochet 
in the top of the previous row’s turning chain. Turn your work.
 
5. Rep Rows 3–4 for desired length.
 
 Repeat Row 3 and then repeat Row 4, alternating these 2 rows until your

 Begin the last row from the right side, chain 3 for your turning chain, 
and then work 1 double crochet stitch in each double crochet stitch and 
each chain-1 space across the entire row. You should have the same 
number of double crochet stitches in this row as you have in Row 1.

his part gets down to the nitty-gritty techniques you 
need for crocheting. We unravel the mysteries of the 
basic stitches that you need to start making beautiful and 
useful crocheted projects. We also delve into the subjects 
of increasing and decreasing, crocheting in circles, and 
working with more than one color of yarn.
To help demonstrate these new topics, we provide several 
projects that you’ll be crocheting in no time flat. To get 
you used to reading crochet patterns, the projects start 
out with both the Crochetese and the plain-English trans-
lations. By the end of the part, however, we eliminate the 
translations. (Note: If you’re ever not entirely comfortable 
reading the instructions in Crochetese, you can always 
refer to Chapter 4 for help deciphering the abbreviations.)

W
hen you think about it, crochet is nothing more than a series of 
loops made with a hook and some yarn, worked row on row or 
round after round. Piece o’ cake! This chapter takes you through the basics 
of getting your loops right: from picking up your hook and holding your 
yarn to completing your first rows of stitches. It also includes diagrams and 
instructions for both lefties and righties.
In the Beginning: Preparing to Crochet
Before you even attempt your first stitch, you need to get some basic skills 
under your belt. The following sections explain which hand you should 
crochet with and show you how to hold the hook and yarn and how to get 
the yarn on the hook with slipknots and yarn overs.
Determining the correct hand for hooking
The “right” hand for holding your crochet hook isn’t necessarily the one on 
your right side. Your dominant hand — the one you write with, eat with, and 
do just about everything else with — is the hand you should hold your hook 
in. This is the hand that does most of the action; your other hand guides the 
yarn and holds the work you’ve already completed.

60
Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
 
All the information in this book deals with techniques from a right-hander’s 
point of view, but it applies to you lefties as well. Don’t get discouraged. 
Your motions are exactly the same. If the instruction says right, think left; 
if it says left, think right. In order to make sure you get off on the right foot 
(or should we say left foot?), however, the beginning crochet techniques in 
this chapter include diagrams for both hands. See the nearby sidebar, “For 
southpaws only,” for some additional techniques to help you through the 
rest of this book.
Getting a grip on the hook and yarn
Even though you crochet with only one hook, both hands are busy the whole 
time. Your dominant hand holds the hook, and your other hand holds the 
yarn. We explain how in the next sections.
Holding the hook
Holding your crochet hook is pretty simple. You just need to get the correct 
grip on it. If your hand isn’t comfortable, it can cramp up, resulting in uneven 
stitches. Crocheting should be relaxing, not a continuous fight with the hook 
and yarn. Experiment with the two following positions to see which one feels 
more comfortable for you. Both are common ways of holding the crochet 
hook that work just fine — for lefties or righties:
 
✓ Over-the-hook position: Place your dominant hand over the hook with 
the handle resting against your palm and your thumb and middle finger 
grasping the thumb rest (see Figure 5-1).
 
Figure 5-1: 
The over-
the-hook 
position for 
lefties and 
righties.
 
 
✓ Under-the-hook position: Hold the hook as you would a pencil with the 
thumb rest between your forefinger and thumb (see Figure 5-2).

61
 Chapter 5: Focusing on Fundamental Stitches
 
Figure 5-2: 
The under-
the-hook 
position for 
lefties and

Holding the yarn
After you decide how you want to hold the hook, you’re ready for the yarn. 
Your yarn hand — the hand not holding your hook — has an important job: 
Not only does it feed the yarn to your crochet hook but it also controls the 
tension of the yarn.
 
Right-handed crocheters wrap the yarn over their left hand; left-handed 
crocheters wrap the yarn over their right hand. Figure 5-3 shows you what 
yarn wrapped around your hand should look like. (It may look like it, but your 
fingers really don’t have to be contortionists to get into position.)
 
Figure 5-3: 
Wrapping 
the yarn 
over your 
yarn hand.
 
The following steps offer one common method for wrapping the yarn around 
your hand:
 
1. Starting from underneath your hand, bring the yarn up between your 
little finger and ring finger.
 
2. Wrap the yarn around your little finger to form a loop.
 
3. Draw the yarn under your ring finger and middle finger.
 
4. Bring the yarn up to the top of your hand between your middle finger 
and forefinger.
 
5. Finally, lay the yarn over your forefinger and under your thumb.

62
Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
To keep the yarn in place, grasp the end of the yarn between your middle 
finger and thumb. You can control the yarn tension by raising or lowering 
your forefinger, so practice wrapping and rewrapping the yarn around your 
yarn hand. If you ever feel that your working yarn is too loose or too tight, 
stop and rewrap to get the proper tension. (Don’t worry. This motion soon 
becomes an ingrained habit.)
Note: Other methods of wrapping the yarn around your hand exist. If you 
prefer, you can just wrap the yarn around your forefinger twice, or you 
can weave the yarn through all of your fingers except your little finger. 
Regardless of the method you choose, the goal should be to allow the yarn 
to flow smoothly and evenly through your fingers so you can apply just the 
right amount of tension.
 
When you first start working with yarn, use a light, solid-color, worsted-weight 
yarn (see Chapter 2 for the basics on yarn). This type of yarn allows you to 
see your stitches more clearly and manipulate the yarn more easily. Textured 
or variegated yarn takes a little more babying.
For southpaws only
If thinking left rather than right just isn’t con-
crete enough for you, use the following tips to 
help you work your way through a crochet pat-
tern from the opposite perspective:
 ✓ Replace the word right with left in pattern 
instructions. If you’re planning to crochet 
with your left hand, look over the pattern, 
cross out the word right, and replace it with 
the word left. This troubleshooting step can 
be especially helpful when you’re doing 
“right front” and “left front” shaping on a 
sweater.
 ✓ Rely on a mirror image. If you’re a picture 
person who relies on illustrations to help 
you understand a concept, hold the pictures 
in this book up to a mirror to view them as 
they should be for lefties. Doing so may be 
a bit awkward, but a quick view from the 
correct angle may help you visualize better. 
A makeup mirror that has a base and can 
sit on the open page works well and leaves 
your hands free to follow the image in the 
mirror.
 ✓ Trace your way to success. If you want a 
more permanent illustration, or if the mirror 
trick just doesn’t cut it for you, trace the dia-
grams and illustrations on a piece of tracing 
paper and then flip the paper over. Doing 
so gives you the view from the left-hand 
side. (Want a more high-tech approach? If 
you have a scanner and a photo software 
application on your computer, scan the 
diagrams and illustrations and flip them 
horizontally.)
 ✓ Try to crochet the right-handed way. If 
you’re brand-new to the craft and some-

ing right-handed. You may be surprised 
that your hands do just what you tell them, 
thereby avoiding the extra work of having to 
translate the instructions.

From this point on, the diagrams in this chapter aren’t marked “lefty” or 
“righty.” But here’s a clue: The left diagrams in the figures are for lefties, and 
the right diagrams are for righties.
Working a slipknot
To get started on any crocheted piece, you first have to join, or attach, the 
yarn to the hook with a slipknot. The standard slipknot is really simple. Just 
follow these steps:
 
1. Beginning about 6 inches from the end of the yarn, make a loop that 
looks somewhat like a pretzel.
 
 Refer to the pretzel-shaped loop on the hook in Figure 5-4.
 
2. Insert your hook through the center of the loop and draw the working 
end of the yarn through.
 
 Refer to the shaded section of the pretzel-shaped loop in Figure 5-4.
 
Figure 5-4: 
Pulling 
the yarn 
through the 
loop.
 
 
3. Pull gently on both ends of the yarn to tighten the loop around the 
hook (see Figure 5-5).
 
 Pulling on the tail end alone tightens the knot below the hook, and 
pulling on the working end adjusts the loop around the hook.
 
Figure 5-5: 
Tightening 
the loop 
around the 
hook.

Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
 
A good slipknot should slide easily up and down the hook’s shaft, but it 
shouldn’t be so loose that it slides off over the end of the hook. If your knot is 
too loose, gently pull on the working end of the yarn to snug it up. Also, 
because you have to pull your hook back through to make your first stitch, 
your slipknot shouldn’t be too tight either. If it is too tight, simply tug on the 
loop to loosen it, leaving some space below the hook where the yarn for the 
next stitch will pass through.
 
If pulling on the working end of the yarn doesn’t tighten your slipknot on the 
hook but yanking on the tail end does, you made your slipknot backwards. 
Simply remove the loop from the hook, tug on both ends to release the knot, 
and try again.
Now that you have the yarn on the hook, you’re ready to begin making 
stitches. Make sure your hands are in the proper position, holding the 
slipknot with your yarn hand. If you’re using the over-the-hook method for 
holding the hook (with your forefinger on top of the hook, your thumb 
underneath, and the shaft resting against your palm), see Figure 5-6 for the 
proper position of both hands.
 
Figure 5-6: 
Proper 
position of 
both hands 
for the over-
the-hook 
position.
 
If you’re more comfortable with the under-the hook position (where you’re 
holding the hook similar to the way you’d hold a pen or pencil), refer to 
Figure 5-7 for a visual of the proper positioning.

 Chapter 5: Focusing on Fundamental Stitches
Wrapping the yarn over the hook
Wrapping the yarn over the hook, called a yarn over (abbreviated yo), is the 
most basic step to any crochet stitch. Sometimes you yarn over before you 
insert the hook into the next stitch, sometimes after, and sometimes you 
yarn over two or more times. The location and number of yarn overs really 
depends on the stitch.
Yarning over is very simple, but you have to do it right. Otherwise you won’t 
be able to draw the yarn smoothly through the stitch. Practice the yarn over 
motion until you’re comfortable with it. To yarn over correctly, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Make a slipknot.
 
2. Slide the slipknot onto the hook’s shaft.
 
3. With your yarn hand, hold the tail of the slipknot between your 
thumb and middle finger.
 
4. Using the forefinger of your yarn hand, bring the yarn up behind the 
hook.
 
5. Lay the yarn over the hook’s shaft, positioned between the slipknot 
and the throat of the hook, as shown in Figure 5-8.
 
Figure 5-8: 
What a 
finished 
yarn over 
looks like 
when done 
correctly.
 
 
Always try to keep the loops on the hook loose enough so they slide easily on 
the hook.
 
If you try to wrap the yarn over your hook from front to back (see Figure 5-9), 
rather than from back to front, crocheting is more difficult, and you end up 
with twisted, tangled stitches.

Tied Up in Stitches: The Three Basics
Three basic stitches are used most often in crochet: the chain stitch, the slip 
stitch, and the single crochet. The next sections walk you through how to 
create these simple stitches.
 
The first few stitches you make are often the hardest because you don’t have 
much material to grasp onto with your yarn hand. Be patient; we promise it 
gets easier.
The (almost) universal 
starter: Chain stitch
The chain stitch (abbreviated ch) is the basis for all crochet. Almost every 
pattern begins with a chain stitch. If you’re working in rows, your first row 
is a series of chain stitches, which (not surprisingly) is called a foundation 
chain. When you’re ready to start a new row, guess what? You use the chain 
stitch! Sometimes you work just a few chain stitches and join them together 
to create a ring, which you use when working in rounds (see Chapter 8 for 
more about rounds).
In the following sections, we explain how to make the chain stitch and 
provide pointers on a few basic techniques, such as controlling the tension 
of your yarn, distinguishing the right side of the fabric from the wrong side, 
counting stitches, and working other stitches into chain stitches.
Creating your first chain stitch
Here’s how to create your first chain stitch:
 
1. Make a slipknot.
 
 See the earlier “Working a slipknot” section for instructions.
 
2. Slide the slipknot onto the hook’s shaft.

67
 Chapter 5: Focusing on Fundamental Stitches
 
3. With the forefinger of your yarn hand, yarn over the hook (yo) from 
back to front while holding the tail of the slipknot between the thumb 
and middle finger of your yarn hand.
 
4. Slide the yarn from the yarn over onto the throat of the hook.
 
5. With your hook hand, rotate the hook toward you so the throat faces 
the slipknot.
 
6. With gentle pressure upward on the hook, pull the hook (which is car-
rying the wrapped strand of yarn) through the loop on your hook, as 
shown in Figure 5-10.
 
 You now have 1 complete chain stitch (ch) and 1 loop remaining on your 
hook.
 
Figure 5-10: 
Making a 
chain stitch.
 
Repeat Steps 3 through 6 until you feel comfortable with this motion.
 
Whenever you’re drawing the hook through a loop or stitch, rotate it so the 
throat faces slightly downward and apply gentle pressure upward on the hook 
so it doesn’t catch on any other loops of yarn. Pulling the hook away from the 
knot opens up the loop on the hook slightly and helps to provide space for the 
new yarn to go through the loop.
Controlling your yarn tension
Each chain stitch should be the same size as the one before it, which means that 
you’re keeping your yarn tension even for all of your stitches. (See Figure 5-11.) 
If your stitches aren’t the same size, don’t get frustrated. The chain stitch 
takes practice, but pretty soon, you’ll find yourself moving right along.
 
Try these tips for fixing tight and loose chain stitches:
 
✓ If you find that your stitches are very tight and it’s difficult to draw 
the hook through the stitch, try relaxing your hands. You’re probably 
pulling too tightly on the yarn as you’re drawing it through.
 
✓ If you find that your stitches are too loose, shorten up the distance 
between your yarn hand and hook hand, and lift the forefinger of your 
yarn hand, thereby creating more tension.

68
Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
 
Figure 5-11: 
Several 
completed 
chain 
stitches and 
growing.
 
 
As your chain gets longer and your hands get farther apart, you may have 
trouble controlling your work. Just let go of the bottom of your chain and, 
with the thumb and middle finger of your yarn hand, grab onto the chain 
closer to the hook, as Figure 5-12 shows. Holding the chain closer to the hook 
keeps your work stationary so you can control your stitches and maintain 
even tension. As your work gets longer, keep readjusting so you’re always 
holding your completed work relatively close to the hook. (Note: This bit of 
advice applies to all of your work as you’re crocheting, not just chains. In fact, 
you’ll probably find that you do it without even thinking about it after a while.)

Telling right from wrong
Each stitch has a right side (front) and a wrong side (back). The right side 
of the chain is smooth, and you can see each stitch clearly. The wrong side 
has a small bumpy loop on each stitch. Figure 5-13 shows both the right and 
wrong sides of a chain.

69
 Chapter 5: Focusing on Fundamental Stitches
 
Figure 5-13: 
Looking at 
the right and 
wrong (front 
and back) 
sides of a 
chain.
 
Right side
Wrong side
 
When you’re talking about the right or wrong side of a piece of crocheted 
fabric, the first row of stitches (not counting the foundation chain) is generally 
considered the right side. You can always distinguish which side of the fabric 
you’re looking at by locating the tail of the foundation chain. If it’s on your left 
(that is, if you’re right-handed), then the right side is facing you; if it’s on the 
right, then the wrong side is toward you. (The reverse is true for lefties.)
Counting stitches
 
Knowing what to count as a stitch is important when figuring out whether 
you’ve crocheted enough chain stitches for your foundation chain. 
Fortunately, it’s quite easy. The loop on your hook doesn’t count as a stitch. 
The first stitch is the one directly below your hook, and you begin counting 
from there, continuing down the chain until you reach the last chain stitch 
before the slipknot, which you don’t count either. For example, Figure 5-14, in 
the next section, shows a chain of six chain stitches.
Working other stitches into chain stitches
To work your next row of stitches into the chain stitches, you have to know 
where to insert your hook. If you look at an individual stitch, you see that it 
consists of three separate loops or strands of yarn: two strands that create 
the V on the right side, which are called the top 2 loops, and a third that cre-
ates the bump on the wrong side. You can insert your hook anywhere in 
the stitch and start stitching, but you get the best results like this: With the 
right side of the chain facing you, insert your hook between the top loops 
and under the back bump loop, catching the loops on your hook (as shown 
in Figure 5-14). Working in the chain stitches like this gives you a neat base 
without any loose loops hanging down. (See the later “The Anatomy of a 
Stitch” section for more about top loops and the other parts of a complete 
crochet stitch.)

The utility stitch: Slip stitch
The slip stitch (abbreviated sl st) is the flattest (or smallest) of all the crochet 
stitches, and only the chain stitch is easier to make. Although you can use it 
to crochet a fabric, the slip stitch is really more of a utility stitch. Here are a 
few of its uses:
 
✓ Making a seam: Slip stitching is good for joining pieces of crocheted 
fabric. Because the slip stitch is relatively flat, it doesn’t create a bulky 
seam. (See Chapter 15 for more on joining pieces of crochet.)
 
✓ Shaping your work: If you have to travel from one point to another to 
shape a crocheted item, such as for armholes in a garment, and you 
don’t want to fasten off your yarn and rejoin it, the slip stitch is ideal 
because it’s so flat it’s almost invisible.
 
✓ Joining a new ball of yarn: When you have to join your yarn in a 
new place, whether for shaping purposes or to change colors (see 
Chapter 9), you use the slip stitch to attach it.
 
✓ Creating a ring: If you’re working in rounds (like for a doily), the slip 
stitch joins one end of the chain to the other to create a ring. (We 
explain how to work in rounds in Chapter 8.)
 
✓ Finishing the edges of your work: Used as a final row or round on a 
design, the slip stitch creates a nice, neat border.
 
✓ Embellishing crocheted fabric: You can slip stitch across the surface of 
a piece of crocheted fabric to create the look of embroidery. (Chapter 18 
gives you lots of embellishment ideas.)
 
✓ Forming combination stitches: You can combine the slip stitch with 
other stitches to form fancy-schmancy stitches. For example, you can 
combine the chain stitch with the slip stitch to form a picot stitch. (For 
more on combination stitches, see Chapter 10.)
The following steps show you how to make a slip stitch that forms a ring:
 
1. Make a chain that’s 6 chain stitches (ch 6) long.

71
 Chapter 5: Focusing on Fundamental Stitches
 
2. Insert the hook into the first chain stitch you made.
 
 This is the stitch that’s farthest from your hook, as shown in Figure 5-15.

3. With your yarn hand, yarn over (yo) by wrapping the yarn from back 
to front over the hook; with your hook hand, rotate the throat of the 
hook toward you.
 
4. While applying gentle pressure upward, draw the hook with the 
wrapped yarn back through the stitch and then through the loop on 
the hook in one motion (see Figure 5-16).

Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
 
The slip stitch forming a ring is all we show here, but no matter where you 
work the stitch, you always do it the same way.
The old standby: Single crochet
The single crochet (abbreviated sc) is the most fundamental of all stitches. A 
compact stitch, it creates a tight, dense fabric. You use this stitch over and 
over again, alone or in combination with other stitches. In the following 
sections, we explain how to make your first single crochet and complete a 
full row.
Creating your first single crochet
To begin your first row of single crochet:
 
1. Make a foundation chain by doing 17 chain stitches (ch 17).
 
2. With the right side of the foundation chain facing you and your yarn 
hand holding the foundation chain, insert the hook from front to back 
into the second chain from the hook. (See Figure 5-18.)

hook into

3. With your yarn hand, yarn over (yo) by wrapping the yarn from back 
to front over the hook.
 
4. Rotate the throat of the hook toward you with your hook hand.
 
5. Pull the hook with the wrapped yarn through the stitch, as Figure 5-19 
shows.
 
 You should have 2 loops on your hook.
 
Figure 5-19: 
Drawing 
the yarn

73
 Chapter 5: Focusing on Fundamental Stitches
 
6. With your yarn hand, yarn over again and then rotate the throat of 
the hook toward you with your hook hand.
 
7. Draw the hook with the wrapped yarn through both loops on the 
hook, as shown in Figure 5-20.
 
 One single crochet (sc) is complete, and 1 loop remains on your hook.
 
Figure 5-20: 
Pull the 
yarn gently 
through 
both loops 
on the hook.
 
Continuing your first row of single crochet
Here’s how to work the next single crochet stitch and continue the row:
 
1. Insert your hook from front to back into the next chain stitch (ch), as 
shown in Figure 5-21.
 
Figure 5-21: 
Inserting 
the hook 
into the next 
chain stitch.
 
 
2. Repeat Steps 3 through 7 from the first single crochet stitch 
instructions in the preceding section to complete the second stitch.
 
3. Work 1 single crochet stitch (sc) in each chain stitch across the foun-
dation chain.
 
 You should have 16 single crochet stitches, or 1 row of single crochet, 
as in Figure 5-22.
 
Figure 5-22: 
A complete 
row of 
single 
crochet.
 

74
Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
If you’re wondering what happened to your 17th chain stitch, remember that 
you worked your first single crochet into the second chain from the hook. 
The skipped chain stitch is considered a turning chain that brings you up to 
the level needed to work your first stitch of the new row (see the “Climbing 
to new heights with turning chains” section, later in this chapter, for more on 
this topic).
 
Working stitches into the foundation chain isn’t easy. Even experienced 
crocheters can have a tough time with this technique. But after the first few 
rows, you have more fabric to hold on to, which makes inserting your hook 
much easier.
Foundation Stitches: The Chain 
and the First Row All in One
Sometimes a pattern may direct you to use foundation stitches rather than 
a foundation chain made up of chain stitches. Foundation stitches are a nifty 
way to make the foundation chain and first row of stitches all at the same 
time. Easily adapted to any stitch, like the single crochet that we describe 
earlier in this chapter, each foundation stitch is made up of two parts: the 
foundation chain (which is at the base) and one standard stitch.
Foundation stitches have a few advantages over the standard foundation 
chain. They’re generally
 
✓ Easier to keep track of, especially when you’re working a long 
foundation row
 
✓ Good at keeping the tension of the foundation chain and first row even 
and consistent
 
✓ More elastic than standard foundation chains, making them especially 
suitable for garments
 
✓ Handy for making multiple increases at the ends of a row (see Chapter 7 
for the scoop on increases)
You can work any stitch as a foundation stitch, but to keep it simple, we 
show you how to work several foundation single crochet (abbreviated fsc) in 
the following sections. Remember: Each foundation single crochet is a blend 
of one foundation chain stitch and one single crochet.

75
 Chapter 5: Focusing on Fundamental Stitches
 
To make taller foundation stitches, you need to add a chain stitch to the 
beginning of the first row and make the required yarn overs as for the regular 
stitch. For example, to make a foundation double crochet (abbreviated fdc), 
begin with three chains and yarn over the hook before beginning the first 
stitch. Make the foundation chain as you would for the foundation single cro-
chet and then work the loops off two at a time as you would a normal double 
crochet stitch (Chapter 6 has more on double crochet).
Your first foundation single crochet
Follow these steps to create your first foundation single crochet:
 
1. Begin with 2 chain stitches (ch 2).
 
 Refer to the earlier “The (almost) universal starter: Chain stitch” section 
for guidance on forming this stitch.
 
2. Insert the hook from front to back into the chain farthest from the 
hook.
 
3. Yarn over (yo) by wrapping the yarn from back to front over the hook 
and pull the yarn through the chain stitch. See Figure 5-23.
 
 You should have 2 loops on the hook.
 
Figure 5-23: 
Pulling 
your yarn 
through a 
chain stitch.
 
 
4. Yarn over the hook and pull the yarn through the first loop (the one 
closest to the hook end) on the hook.
 
 Well done! You’ve just completed the foundation chain portion (shown 
in Figure 5-24) of your first foundation single crochet stitch (fsc).

 This completes the single crochet (sc) portion (shown in Figure 5-25) of 
your first foundation single crochet stitch.
 
Figure 5-25:

Your second foundation single 
crochet and beyond
After you make your first foundation single crochet, follow these steps to 
create your second one:
 
1. Insert the hook from front to back into the chain stitch (ch) made at 
the base of the previous stitch (see Figure 5-26).
 
2. Yarn over (yo) by wrapping the yarn from back to front over the hook 
and pull the yarn through the chain stitch.
 
 You should have 2 loops on the hook (see Figure 5-27). 
 
3. Yarn over the hook and pull the yarn through the first loop on the 
hook (the one hanging out closer to the hook end).
 
 This completes the foundation chain portion (shown in Figure 5-28) of 
your second foundation single crochet stitch (fsc).

Taking Things to the Next 
Level: Row Two
If you read the earlier section on the single crochet stitch and followed the 
steps, you now have a complete row of single crochet, and you’re probably 
thinking, “Now what?” The answer’s simple: You turn around and work back 
the same way you came. The following sections show you how to turn your 
work around so that the tops of the stitches in the previous row are in the 
proper position, which way to turn, and how to begin that first stitch of the 
new row.
Turning your work
To turn your work around so you can start a new row of stitches, keep the 
last loop on your hook and simply take the completed work, which should 
be positioned under your hook hand, and turn it toward you until the work 
is positioned under your yarn hand (see Figure 5-30). This way, you hold the 
work between the middle finger and thumb of your yarn hand, your yarn is 
positioned behind your work, and the hook is in place to work the beginning 
stitches of the next row.
 
Keep in mind that each time you turn your work to crochet back across the 
previous row, a different side of the piece will be facing you. If the first row 
is designated as the right side of the piece, then when you turn to work the 
second row, the wrong side is facing you. The third row again has the right 
side facing you, and so on. (See the earlier “Telling right from wrong” section 
for a refresher on what the right and wrong sides of a piece look like.)

Climbing to new heights 
with turning chains
After you turn your piece around, you’re ready to crochet the turning chain, 
the one or more chain stitches that you make after you’ve turned your work 
and are about to begin your next row. The purpose of the turning chain is to 
bring your yarn to the height necessary in order to work the first stitch of 
your next row or round.
The number of chain stitches you make in the turning chain depends on what 
the next stitch in the row is, because some stitches are taller than others. 
Figure 5-31 shows the height differences of several turning chains used for 
successively taller stitches. (See Chapter 6 for more info on taller stitches.)

The turning chain almost always counts as the first stitch of the next row, 
except for the single crochet. (The single crochet turning chain isn’t wide 
enough to substitute for the first single crochet of the row and creates a rough 
edge to your rows. Working a single crochet stitch in the first stitch of the row 
fills out each row on the end.)
Starting the next row
Going back and forth and back and forth may not get you places in real life, 
but it sure does when you’re crocheting in rows. The following steps show 
you how to make your turning chain and begin a new row of single crochet, 
so grab your completed row of 16 single crochet stitches from the earlier 
single crochet section:
 
1. Turn your work to prepare for the next row.
 
2. Make 1 chain stitch (ch 1).
 
 This is your turning chain for single crochet (sc).
 
3. Insert your hook from front to back underneath the top 2 loops of the 
first stitch, as shown in Figure 5-32.
 
Figure 5-32: 
Inserting the 
hook under 
the top 2 
loops of the 
first stitch.
 

81
 Chapter 5: Focusing on Fundamental Stitches
 
4. Yarn over (yo) by wrapping the yarn from back to front over the hook.
 
5. Draw your yarn through the stitch, as shown in Figure 5-33.
 
Figure 5-33:

the yarn 
through the

6. Yarn over again by wrapping the yarn from back to front over the 
hook.
 
7. Draw your yarn through the 2 loops on the hook.
 
 Now you have 1 single crochet in the second row completed, and 1 loop 
remains on the hook. (See Figure 5-34.)
 
Figure 5-34: 
A new row 
with one 
complete 
single 
crochet.
 
To complete the row, work one single crochet stitch in each single crochet 
stitch from the previous row and continue doing so all the way to the end. 
You work the stitches exactly the same way as when you’re working them 
into the foundation chain; you just place your hook in the top of a stitch from 
a previous row instead. Make sure to count your stitches when you get to the 
end of the row. You should have exactly the same number of stitches in the 
second row as in the first (in this case, 16).
 
Some patterns like to change things up and may tell you to insert your hook in 
a different place in the previous row. But if no specific instructions are given, 
always work the stitches in each subsequent row under the top 2 loops of 
the stitch in the previous row. This is the best way to create a smooth, even 
fabric.

82
Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
 
Working a practice swatch helps you figure out new stitches and start making 
them like a pro. Use worsted-weight yarn (it’s easiest to work with) and a size 
H-8 U.S. (5 mm) hook (see Chapter 2 for more on yarn weights and hook sizes) 
to make a foundation chain that’s approximately 4 inches long and then chain 
1 for your turning chain. Work as many rows of single crochet as you need to 
until you feel comfortable with the new stitch and your stitches have a 
smooth, even look.
The Anatomy of a Stitch
After you’re comfortable holding the hook and the yarn and making a few 
basic stitches, you’re ready to explore the anatomy of a stitch in more detail 
so you know where to put the hook for stitches we cover in the rest of this 
book. Fortunately, a stitch’s anatomy isn’t nearly as complicated as that of 
the frog you dissected in high school.
The following list breaks down each part of a stitch (you can check out 
Figure 5-35 for the visual):
 
✓ Top 2 loops: The two loops you see at the top of the stitch.
 
✓ Front loop: The top loop closest to you.
 
✓ Front-most loop: The loop found at the front of a stitch, just below the 
front loop. This loop is found in stitches with at least one extra yarn 
over, like the half double crochet or double crochet. (See Chapter 6 for 
an introduction to these stitches.)
 
✓ Back loop: The top loop farthest from you or behind the front loop.
 
✓ Back-most loop: The loop found at the back of a stitch just below the 
back loop. This loop is found in stitches with at least one extra yarn 
over, like the half double crochet or double crochet.
 
✓ Base: The two loops at the bottom of the stitch. The base of a new stitch 
is the top of the stitch below it.
 
 The base is the most stable part of a stitch to work into when working a 
border or sewing pieces together.
 
✓ Post: The body of the stitch, located between the top 2 loops and the 
base. It varies in height depending on the stitch and is also referred to as 
the stem. When it’s located at the end of a row and you’re working into it 
when adding a border or edging, the post is also considered the side of 
the stitch.

All’s Well That Ends Well: Fastening Off
Sooner or later, you’re going to come to the end of your design and need to 
fasten off (cut) the yarn. Or maybe you’re working with different colors and 
need to fasten off one color to join the new color (see Chapter 9 for more on 
switching colors). The next sections show you how and where to cut the yarn 
and what to do with the leftover tail.
Cutting the yarn
To fasten off your yarn, cut it about 6 inches from the hook. (See the next 
section to find out why you leave this much yarn.) Using your hook, draw 
the cut end of the yarn through the last remaining loop on your hook, as 
shown in Figure 5-36. Pull gently on the tail of yarn to snug up the end. This 
action keeps your work from coming apart without you having to make large, 
unsightly knots.

Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
Weaving in the end
Weaving in the leftover tail through a few stitches ensures that your yarn 
ends are secured and hidden, resulting in a neatly finished appearance. To 
do this, thread the remaining yarn tail onto a yarn needle (which we introduce 
in Chapter 2). Being careful not to split the yarn of the stitches, weave the 
6-inch tail of yarn through four or five stitches — kind of in a zigzag pattern. 
To really make the end secure, go back the way you came, weaving the end 
backward through those same few stitches. When finished, cut the yarn 
about 1⁄4 inch from the fabric and gently pull the fabric. The end disappears 
like magic, and your work is secure.
 
The stitches you weave your ends through depend on the position of the 
tail end.
 
✓ If your end comes out at the top or bottom of the piece, simply weave it 
back and forth under the top loops of the stitches along the same row.
 
✓ If your end emerges along the side of the fabric, weave it vertically, 
either up or down, through the stitches found along the same edge.
 
Always check to make sure your woven ends aren’t visible from the right side 
of the work. If you find that one is, simply pull it through the fabric to the 
wrong side.
Luxurious Washcloth Projects
The following projects let you practice your newfound basic skills while 
creating luxuriously soft and absorbent washcloths that are suitable for 
yourself or as gifts for friends. Check out both projects in the color section.
Simple Luxurious Washcloth project
The yarn used in this project is a lofty, organic, worsted-weight cotton that 
grows softer with each wash and is easy to find in an array of natural or 
bright colors. Feel free to use the given color (shown in the color section) 
or choose your own to match your style. One skein contains enough yarn to 
make two cloths.

single crochet section earlier in this chapter for details on each stitch.
 
1. Create your foundation chain by working 36 chain stitches in a row 
(ch 36).
 
2. To complete Row 1, work 1 single crochet stitch (sc) in the second 
chain from the hook and then work 1 single crochet stitch in each 
chain across the row.
 
 You should have 35 complete single crochet stitches.
 
3. Turn your work and then chain 1 for the single crochet turning chain 
to prepare for the next row.
 
4. To complete the next row, work 1 single crochet stitch in each single 
crochet stitch across the row.
 
 You should have 35 complete single crochet stitches in this row.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until you have 40 rows on your work.
 
6. Fasten off your yarn and weave in the loose ends using the yarn 
needle.
Luxurious Washcloth with Border project
This project, a simple adaptation of the previous washcloth, takes your skills 
to the next level with the addition of a bright and colorful border. Working 
on this project requires a few additional techniques, such as adding a new 
yarn color (see Chapter 9) and working into the sides of the rows (refer to 
Chapter 11). The yarn we recommend is soft and comes in a variety of beauti-
ful colors.

 Chapter 5: Focusing on Fundamental Stitches
To make the washcloth’s body, follow these steps:
 
1. With A, create your foundation chain by working 29 chain stitches in 
a row (ch 29).
 
2. To complete Row 1, work 1 single crochet stitch (sc) in the second 
chain from the hook and then work 1 single crochet stitch in each 
chain across the row.
 
 You should have 28 complete single crochet stitches.
 
3. Turn your work and then chain 1 for the single crochet turning chain 
to prepare for the next row.
 
4. To complete the next row, work 1 single crochet stitch in each single 
crochet stitch across the row.
 
 You should have 28 complete single crochet stitches in this row.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until you have 32 rows on your work.
 
6. Fasten off your yarn and weave in the loose ends using the yarn 
needle.
After you finish crocheting the washcloth’s body, follow these steps to start 
the border:
 
1. Insert your hook in the last stitch of the last row you worked and draw 
B through so you have 1 loop on the hook.
 
 See Chapter 9 for information on how to join a new color.
 
2. Make a corner by working 1 chain (ch 1) and then work 1 single 
crochet (sc), 1 chain, and 1 more single crochet all in the same stitch.
 
3. Working across the side edge of the washcloth, work 1 single crochet 
in each row-end stitch across to the last row-end stitch.
 
4. Make a corner by working 1 single crochet, 1 chain, and 1 more single 
crochet all in the last row-end stitch.
 
 You should have 33 single crochet stitches between the 2 chain spaces.
 
5. Working across the foundation edge, work 1 single crochet stitch in 
each chain stitch across to the last chain.
 
6. Work 1 single crochet, 1 chain, and 1 more single crochet all in the 
last chain stitch of the foundation edge.
 
7. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 once.
 
8. Work 1 single crochet stitch in the next stitch and in each stitch across 
until you reach the first single crochet of the border.
 
9. Work 1 slip stitch (sl st) in the first single crochet stitch to join.

88
Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
To continue Round 2 of the border:
 
1. Continuing in the same direction, and without turning the piece, work 
1 slip stitch (sl st) into the chain space.
 
2. Work 1 single crochet (sc), 1 chain (ch), and 1 more single crochet all 
in the same chain space.
 
3. Work 1 single crochet in the next single crochet and in each single 
crochet across to the chain space at the next corner.
 
 There should be 33 single crochets between the 2 chain spaces.
 
4. Work 1 single crochet, 1 chain, and 1 more single crochet all in the 
corner chain space.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 twice.
 
6. Work 1 single crochet in the next single crochet and in each single 
crochet across to the first single crochet stitch of Round 2.
 
7. Work 1 slip stitch in the first single crochet stitch to join.
 
8. Repeat Round 2 twice more before fastening off the yarn and weaving 
in the loose ends.
Baby washcloth
The two washcloth patterns provided earlier in this chapter make a gener-
ously portioned washcloth, but you can easily adjust the size to create a 
smaller washcloth or one that’s perfect for a baby. All you need to do is work 
half the number of chains for either the basic washcloth or the washcloth 
with a border.
The washcloth with the orange border featured in the color section measures 
5 inches square. To create one that’s similar, make 15 chains and then work 
back and forth on 14 single crochets for 15 rows. Next, work the border as 
instructed in the preceding section.

Chapter 6
Long, Longer, Longest: Several 
Common Crochet Stitches
In This Chapter
▶ Creating four of the most common crochet stitches
▶ Extending a couple basic stitches
▶ Discovering two ways to join a new ball of yarn
▶ Crocheting your first scarf
T
he beauty of crochet is that you can create so many patterns and 
textures by combining just three basic motions:
 
✓ Yarning over the hook
 
✓ Inserting your hook
 
✓ Drawing your yarn through
The first three stitches in this chapter — the double crochet, the triple 
crochet, and the double triple crochet — are each made a step taller than the 
one before with one extra yarn over. How simple is that? The fourth stitch, 
the half double crochet, is slightly different but makes sense after you 
master the other stitches in this chapter. We also throw in a couple extra 
stitches that are simple, extended variations on some basics. Each of the 
stitches presented in this chapter produces a slightly different textured 
fabric. When you combine them, the variety of possible patterns is endless!
Of course, now that you’re making so many stitches, you’re going to run out 
of yarn, so this chapter also shows you how to join a new skein without any 
unsightly lumps, bumps, or knots. You can put your newfound skills to use in 
the Sassy Scarf project at the end of this chapter. It’s a beautiful design that 
you’ll be proud to show off.

Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
Doing a Double Crochet
The double crochet (abbreviated dc) is one of the most common crochet stitches 
and is about twice as tall as a single crochet, which debuts in Chapter 5. A fabric 
made of all double crochet stitches is fairly solid, but not stiff, and is great for 
sweaters, shawls, afghans, place mats, or any number of other home décor 
items. You can also combine the double crochet stitch with other stitches to 
produce many interesting patterns and textures. The next sections show you 
how to create the first two rows of the double crochet stitch.
First things first: Row 1
The following steps set you up to work your first double crochet stitch 
(see Chapter 5 for a refresher on foundation chains and turning chains):
 
1. Make a foundation chain by doing 15 chain stitches (ch 15).
 
2. Chain 3 more stitches for the turning chain.
 
 The double crochet turning chain makes your edges even with the 
height of the new row and is counted as a double crochet stitch (dc).
 
Most pattern books combine the steps for making a foundation chain and 
turning chain into one by telling you to chain a total of 18.
Now you’re ready for your first double crochet.
 
1. Yarn over the hook (yo).
 
 Always yarn over from back to front when any of the taller stitches call 
for it.
 
2. Insert your hook between the 2 front loops and under the back bump 
loop of the fourth chain (ch) from the hook.
 
 Figure 6-1a provides the visual for this step. Refer to Chapter 5 for 
details on working into chain stitches.

3. Yarn over the hook.
 
4. Gently pull the wrapped hook through the center of the chain stitch, 
carrying the wrapped yarn through the stitch.
 
 You should now have 3 loops on your hook, as shown in Figure 6-1b.
 
5. Yarn over the hook.
 
6. Draw your yarn through the first 2 loops on your hook, like in 
Figure 6-2a.

7. Yarn over the hook.
 
8. Draw your yarn through the last 2 loops on the hook, as in Figure 6-2b.
 
 One double crochet stitch (dc) is now complete. You should have 1 loop 
remaining on your hook.
To finish your first row of double crochet, work one double crochet stitch in 
each successive chain stitch across the foundation chain, beginning in the 
next chain of the foundation chain, as shown in Figure 6-3a. You should have 
16 double crochet stitches in Row 1 (counting the turning chain as the first 
double crochet). Take a look at Figure 6-3b to see what the end of the first 
row of double crochet looks like.

Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
Turning around and beginning 
again: Row 2
To work the second row of double crochet, follow these steps:
 
1. Turn your work so that the back side is facing you.
 
 Chapter 5 explains how to turn your work correctly.
 
2. Chain 3 (ch 3) to create the turning chain.
 
3. Yarn over the hook (yo).
 
4. Skipping the first stitch of the row directly below the turning chain, 
insert your hook into the next stitch.
 
 Skipping the first stitch on taller stitches, such as the double crochet, 
keeps the edges even and straight. Figure 6-4a illustrates the right place 
to insert your hook, and Figure 6-4b shows the wrong one.

5. Repeat Steps 3 through 8 from the preceding section in each of the 
next 14 double crochet stitches (dc).
 
 Be sure to yarn over before inserting your hook into each stitch.
 
6. Work 1 double crochet in the top chain of the previous row’s turning 
chain, as shown in Figure 6-5.
 
 You should have 16 double crochet stitches in Row 2 (counting the 
turning chain as 1 double crochet).

93

Figure 6-5:

Repeat these steps for each additional row of double crochet until you feel 
comfortable working this stitch. Figure 6-6 shows you how rows of double 
crochet look as a fabric.
 
Figure 6-6: 
Several 
rows of 
double 
crochet.
 
 
Don’t work a stitch into the first stitch of the row after the turning chain. 
Doing so produces an extra stitch, and if you continue to add a stitch in each 
row, your design grows ever wider as it gets longer and longer. Also, don’t 
forget to put a double crochet into the top of the turning chain when you get 
to the end of a row. If you do, you’ll lose a stitch, and continuing to drop a 
stitch per row makes your design narrower and narrower as it grows longer 
and longer. Be sure to count your stitches frequently to make sure you haven’t 
inadvertently gained (or lost) any along the way.

94
Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
 
Sometimes, especially when you’re working with bulky yarn or a larger-than-
usual hook, the turning chain on a double crochet row leaves a gap at the 
beginning of the row. To get a neater edge, try chaining two rather than three 
stitches for the turning chain.
Trying Your Hand at the Triple Crochet
The triple crochet (abbreviated tr), also called a treble crochet in many 
publications, is slightly longer than the double crochet. This stitch creates 
longer openings between the stitches and therefore produces a very loose 
fabric. For example, if you make a sweater with triple crochet, you’ll want to 
wear a blouse under it or else risk revealing too much. However, the triple 
crochet is usually combined with other stitches in order to create pattern 
variety and produce interesting textures and fancier stitches. The following 
sections break down how to crochet your first two rows of triple crochet.
Starting with Row 1
Follow these steps so you’re ready to make your first row of triple crochet 
(and, if necessary, check out Chapter 5 to refresh your memory on chains):
 
1. Make a foundation chain by doing 15 chain stitches (ch 15).
 
2. Chain 4 more stitches for the turning chain.
 
If a particular pattern tells you to start Row 1 of triple crochet by chaining 19, 
don’t be surprised. It has merely combined the steps for making a foundation 
chain and turning chain into one.
To begin your first triple crochet stitch:
 
1. Yarn over the hook (yo) 2 times.
 
 Don’t forget to yarn over from back to front.
 
2. Insert your hook into the fifth chain (ch) from the hook, as shown in 
Figure 6-7a.
 
3. Yarn over the hook.
 
4. Gently pull the wrapped hook through the center of the chain stitch, 
carrying the wrapped yarn through the stitch.
 
 You should have 4 loops on your hook, like in Figure 6-7b.

Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
To finish the row, yarn over twice and insert your hook into the next chain of 
the foundation chain, just like in Figure 6-10a. Work one triple crochet in each 
successive chain across the foundation chain. You should have 16 triple 
crochet stitches in Row 1 (counting the turning chain as 1 triple crochet). 
Figure 6-10b shows the end of the first triple crochet row.

Moving on to Row 2
To begin your second row of triple crochet, follow these steps:
 
1. Turn your work.
 
 Refer to Chapter 5 for help properly turning your work.
 
2. Chain 4 (ch 4) for the turning chain.
 
3. Yarn over the hook (yo) 2 times.
 
4. Skipping the first stitch of the row directly below the turning chain, 
insert your hook into the next stitch.
 
 Figure 6-11 depicts the right spot to insert your hook.

 Chapter 6: Long, Longer, Longest: Several Common Crochet Stiches
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 through 10 from the preceding section in each of the 
next 14 triple crochet stitches (tr).
 
 Be sure to yarn over twice before inserting your hook in each stitch.
 
6. Work 1 triple crochet in the top chain of the previous row’s turning 
chain.
 
 When you count the turning chain as 1 triple crochet, you should have 
16 triple crochet stitches in Row 2.
Repeat these six steps for each additional row of triple crochet. Continue 
working rows of triple crochet until you feel comfortable with this stitch. 
To see how rows of triple crochet look as a fabric, check out Figure 6-12.
 
Figure 6-12: 
Several 
rows of

Diving into Double Triple Crochet
The double triple crochet (abbreviated dtr) is even taller than a triple 
crochet. As a fabric, it’s loose and holey and commonly used in lacy designs, 
particularly doilies and other fine cotton crochet patterns. The following 
sections will have you stitching your first two rows of double triple crochet 
in no time.
First things first: Row 1
Before you begin a double triple crochet stitch:
 
1. Make a foundation chain by working 15 chain stitches (ch 15).

98
Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
 
2. Chain 5 more stitches for the turning chain.
 
 Check out Chapter 5 for the lowdown on chains.
 
Most patterns combine these two steps and have you chain 20 to start, so 
don’t be thrown off if you see that somewhere.
To complete your first double triple crochet stitch, perform the following 
seven steps:
 
1. Yarn over the hook (yo) 3 times.
 
 Always yarn over from back to front. Otherwise, you’ll get frustrated 
when the yarn you’re drawing through the stitch falls off the hook.
 
 If you’re using the over-the-hook position to hold the hook, press the 
yarn-over loops to the hook with your index finger to prevent the chain 
from coiling around the hook.
 
2. Insert the hook into the sixth chain (ch) from the hook, as shown in 
Figure 6-13a.

3. Yarn over the hook.
 
4. Gently pull the wrapped hook through the center of the chain stitch, 
carrying the wrapped yarn through the stitch.
 
 You should now have 5 loops on your hook (see Figure 6-13b).
 
5. Yarn over the hook.
 
6. Draw your yarn through the first 2 loops on your hook.
 
 You should have 4 loops remaining.
 
7. Repeat Steps 5 and 6 three more times until you have only 1 loop left 
on the hook.
 
 Congratulations! Your first double triple crochet stitch (dtr) is now 
complete.

99
 Chapter 6: Long, Longer, Longest: Several Common Crochet Stiches
To finish the row, begin a new double triple crochet stitch in the next chain 
of your foundation chain, as indicated in Figure 6-14a. Work one double triple 
crochet in each successive chain across the foundation chain, taking care 
to yarn over three times before inserting the hook in each chain. When you 
finish the row, you should have 16 double triple crochet stitches in Row 1 
(counting the turning chain as 1 double triple crochet). Figure 6-14b illustrates 
what the end of the first row of double triple crochet looks like.

Turning around and beginning again: Row 2
To work the second row of double triple crochet, follow these steps:
 
1. Turn your work.
 
 Chapter 5 explains how to turn your work correctly.
 
2. Chain 5 (ch 5) for the turning chain.
 
3. Yarn over the hook (yo) 3 times.
 
4. Skipping the first stitch of the row directly below the turning chain, 
insert your hook into the next stitch.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 through 7 in the preceding section in each of the next 
14 double triple crochet stitches (dtr).
 
 Be sure to yarn over 3 times before inserting your hook in each stitch.
 
6. Work 1 double triple crochet stitch in the top chain of the previous 
row’s turning chain.
 
 You should have 16 double triple crochet stitches in Row 2 (counting 
the turning chain as 1 double triple crochet).

Hooking a Half Double Crochet
The half double crochet (abbreviated hdc) is kind of an oddball stitch, and 
you make it differently from all the other stitches that appear earlier in this 
chapter. It falls in between a single crochet and a double crochet in height, 
but instead of working off two loops at a time, you draw the yarn through 
Making your stitches even longer
Each additional yarn over that you make at the 
beginning of a stitch adds length to the com-
pleted stitch. So if you continue to add yarn 
overs, you produce longer and longer stitches. 
Here’s a breakdown of the yarn overs involved 
in several different stitches (note that the stitch 
names may vary in different publications):
 ✓ Single crochet (sc): No yarn over
 ✓ Double crochet (dc): Yarn over 1 time
 ✓ Triple crochet (tr): Yarn over 2 times
 ✓ Double triple crochet (dtr): Yarn over 3 times
 ✓ Triple triple crochet (trtr): Yarn over 4 times
 ✓ Double triple triple crochet (dtrtr): Yarn 
over 5 times
 ✓ Quadruple triple triple crochet (quad): Yarn 
over 6 times
The longer stitches are used infrequently, but 
they do exist. Theoretically, you can continue to 
make longer and longer stitches indefinitely, as 
long as your hook can hold all the loops.

three loops on the hook. This action produces a fairly tight fabric similar to 
one made with a single crochet stitch. You can see how to make the first two 
rows of half double crochet in the next sections.
Starting with Row 1
Follow these steps to get started:
 
1. Make a foundation chain with 15 chain stitches (ch 15).
 
2. Chain 2 more for the turning chain.
 
 Check out Chapter 5 for the scoop on chains.
 
Most pattern books combine the steps for making a foundation chain and 
turning chain into one by telling you to chain a total of 17.
To create your first half double crochet stitch:
 
1. Yarn over the hook (yo).
 
 Don’t forget to yarn over from back to front.
 
2. Insert your hook into the third chain (ch) from the hook, as shown in 
Figure 6-16a.

3. Yarn over the hook.
 
4. Gently pull the wrapped hook through the center of the chain stitch, 
carrying the wrapped yarn through the stitch.
 
 You should have 3 loops on your hook, just like in Figure 6-16b.
 
5. Yarn over the hook.
 
6. Draw your yarn through all 3 loops on your hook.
 
 Figure 6-17a depicts Step 6, and Figure 6-17b shows a completed half 
double crochet stitch (hdc).

Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
To complete a full row of half double crochet stitches, begin in the next chain 
of the foundation chain, as indicated in Figure 6-18a. Work one half double 
crochet stitch in each successive chain across the foundation chain. When 
you count the turning chain as 1 half double crochet stitch, you should have 
16 half double crochets at the end of Row 1. Figure 6-18b shows the end of 
the first half double crochet row.

Moving on to Row 2
Here’s how to begin the second row of half double crochet:
 
1. Turn your work.
 
 Refer to Chapter 5 for help properly turning your work.
 
2. Chain 2 (ch 2) for the turning chain.
 
3. Yarn over the hook (yo).
 
4. Skipping the first stitch of the row directly below the turning chain, 
insert your hook into the next stitch, as in Figure 6-19.

103
 Chapter 6: Long, Longer, Longest: Several Common Crochet Stiches
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 through 6 from the preceding section in each of the 
next 14 half double crochet stitches (hdc).
 
 Be sure to yarn over before inserting your hook into each stitch.
 
6. Work 1 half double crochet in the top chain of the previous row’s 
turning chain.
 
 You should have 16 half double crochet stitches in Row 2 if you count 
the turning chain as 1 half double crochet.

Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
Creating Even More Height Variation 
with Extended Stitches
Occasionally a pattern may direct you to make extended crochet stitches, 
which are a little taller than the regular version of the same stitch. They also 
provide variation in texture with a slightly improved drape, meaning a fabric 
made of extended stitches is softer and less dense than one made with 
standard stitches.
 
You can adapt any stitch into an extended stitch. How? Instead of adding a 
yarn over to the beginning of the stitch, like the taller stitches described 
earlier in this chapter, extended stitches include a chain stitch in the middle 
of the stitch to give a little extra lift.
In the following sections, we show you how to work two common extended 
stitches — the extended single crochet and the extended double crochet.
 
An extended stitch is usually abbreviated by adding an E before the standard 
abbreviation. So the abbreviation for extended double crochet, for example, 
is Edc.
Extended single crochet
The extended single crochet (abbreviated Esc) is a simple variation on the 
standard single crochet (abbreviated sc), which we describe in Chapter 5. 
Follow these steps to start:
 
1. Create a foundation chain by working 15 chain stitches (ch 15).
 
2. Chain 1 more for the turning chain.
Now you’re ready to begin your first extended single crochet stitch.
 
1. Insert your hook into the second chain (ch) from the hook.
 
2. Yarn over the hook (yo).
 
 Move from back to front, never front to back.
 
3. Gently pull the wrapped hook through the center of the chain stitch, 
carrying the wrapped yarn through the stitch (as shown in Figure 
6-21).
 
 Now you should have 2 loops on your hook.

Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
To work the next extended single crochet stitch and continue the row:
 
1. Insert your hook into the next chain stitch (ch), yarn over the hook 
(yo), and pull the yarn through the chain stitch.
 
 You should have 2 loops on the hook.
 
2. Repeat Steps 4 through 7 from the preceding instructions to complete 
the second extended single crochet stitch (Esc).
 
3. Work 1 extended single crochet stitch in each chain stitch across the 
foundation chain by repeating Steps 1 and 2.
 
 You should have 15 extended single crochet stitches in the row. 
Figure 6-23 shows you what a completed row of extended single 
crochet looks like.

For the next row, simply turn your work and make one chain for the turning 
chain. Begin the first extended single crochet in the first stitch from the 
previous row.

 Chapter 6: Long, Longer, Longest: Several Common Crochet Stiches
Extended double crochet
The extended double crochet (abbreviated Edc) is a variation on the standard 
double crochet stitch (abbreviated dc) that we describe earlier in this 
chapter. To get started:
 
1. Make a foundation chain by working 15 chain stitches (ch 15).
 
2. Chain 3 more stitches for the turning chain.
To create your first extended double crochet stitch, follow these steps:
 
1. Yarn over the hook (yo).
 
 Always yarn over from back to front.
 
2. Insert your hook into the fourth chain (ch) from the hook.
 
 Refer to Figure 6-1a earlier in this chapter for the proper positioning.
 
3. Yarn over the hook.
 
4. Gently pull the wrapped hook through the center of the chain stitch, 
carrying the wrapped yarn through the stitch.
 
 You should now have 3 loops on your hook. (Refer to Figure 6-1b earlier 
in this chapter for the visual of this step.)
 
5. Yarn over the hook.
 
6. Work a chain stitch by drawing the yarn through the first loop on the 
hook, as in Figure 6-25.
 
Figure 6-25:

7. Yarn over the hook.
 
8. Draw the yarn through the first 2 loops on your hook, like in 
Figure 6-26a.
 
9. Yarn over the hook.
 
10. Draw the yarn through the last 2 loops on the hook, as shown in 
Figure 6-26b.

Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
 
 One extended double crochet stitch (Edc) is now complete, and you 
should have 1 loop remaining on your hook.

To work your next extended double crochet and continue the row:
 
1. Yarn over the hook (yo) and insert your hook into the next chain 
stitch (ch).
 
2. Yarn over and pull the yarn through the chain stitch.
 
 You should have 3 loops on the hook.
 
3. Repeat Steps 5 through 10 from the preceding instructions to complete 
the second extended double crochet stitch (Edc).
 
4. Work 1 extended double crochet stitch in each chain stitch across the 
foundation chain by repeating Steps 1 through 3.
 
 When you count the turning chain as the first extended double crochet, 
you should have 16 extended double crochet stitches in Row 1. Figure 
6-27 shows the end of the first extended double crochet row.
 
Figure 6-27:

To begin the next row of extended double crochet, turn your piece and make 
three chains for the turning chain. Skipping the first stitch, work your first 
extended double crochet stitch into the next stitch on the previous row 
and follow Steps 1 through 3 of the preceding instructions. Take a look at 
Figure 6-28 to see what rows of extended double crochet look like as a fabric.

Running on Empty: Joining 
a New Ball of Yarn
Every ball or skein has a limited amount of yarn on it, so sooner or later 
you’re going to run out of yarn in the middle of a project. Joining a new ball 
or skein of yarn correctly is as important to the appearance of your work as 
the actual stitches. You may find the process awkward at first, but you’ll be 
an old hand at it in no time. You can join a new ball of yarn in any stitch of a 
row, but making the transition at the end of a row creates a neater appearance. 
We describe both methods in the sections that follow.
 
Don’t give in to the temptation to just tie the beginning end of the new ball to 
the tail end of the first ball. This sloppy method produces an unsightly knot in 
your work.
A crocheting constant: Stitch width
Crochet stitches vary in either length or height, 
never width. That’s because all stitches are the 
same width when worked properly with the 
same yarn and hook. Whether you’re making 
a row of 16 chain stitches or fancy three-
dimensional stitches, the width of your piece 
should be the same. After you complete the 
stitch and have one loop remaining on your 
hook, the top of the stitch is still the same width 
as all the other stitches because the size of 
hook you’re using determines the size of both 
that last loop and the width of the stitch.

110
Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
Joining at the end of a row
The following steps use a swatch of fabric made with double crochet stitches, 
so if you haven’t already made a swatch, refer to the “Doing a Double 
Crochet” section, earlier in this chapter, to get ready. After you’ve completed 
a few rows, follow these steps to join new yarn at the end of a row:
 
1. Double crochet (dc) across the row, stopping before the last stitch of 
the row.
 
2. Work the last double crochet to the point where only 2 loops are left 
on the hook.
 
3. Wrap the cut end of the new yarn around the hook, from back to 
front.
 
 The working end of the yarn (the end that’s attached to the ball or skein) 
should be the end closest to you.
 
4. Draw the new yarn through the 2 loops on your hook.
 
 Figure 6-29 illustrates how to perform this step. Note that you should 
have 2 strands of yarn hanging down.

5. Tug on the dropped end of the old yarn at the base of the double 
crochet to tighten up the stitch.
 
 The remaining tail of the old yarn is the tail end. It goes into hiding when 
you weave it into the fabric later on.

111
 Chapter 6: Long, Longer, Longest: Several Common Crochet Stiches
Joining in the middle of a row
Sometimes you have no choice but to join new yarn in the middle of a row, 
such as when you shape necklines or armholes in a garment. To join a new 
ball or skein in such cases, work as follows:
 
1. Make a slipknot on the end of the new ball of yarn.
 
 See Chapter 5 for details on making a slipknot.
 
2. Insert your hook into the stitch where you want to join in the new 
yarn.
 
3. Place the new yarn’s slipknot on the hook.
 
4. Draw the slipknot through the stitch, as shown in Figure 6-30.
 
 One loop is now on your hook, and you’re ready to begin crocheting the 
new row.
 
Figure 6-30: 
Joining yarn 
with a 
slipknot.
 
You can weave the ends of the yarn in later with a yarn needle, but we 
recommend working over the strands while crocheting the next row in order 
to save time. To work over the strands, lay them down over the tops of the 
stitches in the current row; then when you work your stitches, the strands 
are captured in the bases of your stitches. Cut off any excess yarn after 
you’ve covered a few inches.

112
Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
 
Weaving in yarn ends is a tedious, thankless job — and one you should avoid 
whenever you can. Some projects allow you to leave ends dangling off to the 
side to be incorporated into fringe. You can also leave ends dangling on the 
side if they can be sewn into a seam later on. Border stitches are also good for 
covering your ends. (For more information about crocheting borders, see 
Chapter 17.) However you go about avoiding weaving in your yarn ends, just 
don’t try to cover too many strands in one area, or else you’ll create a messy 
lump along the edge of your project.
Sassy Scarf Project
A scarf is a quick, easy, and versatile project that showcases your new skills. 
The pattern in this section incorporates the first four stitches introduced in 
this chapter and gives you the opportunity to practice each of them while 
creating a great fashion accessory.
You work this scarf lengthwise, progressing from rows of short stitches to 
rows of long and longer stitches before working back down again. Don’t be 
intimidated by the number of stitches you need in each row. If you can count, 
you’re good to go. Counting stitches, whether as you go or when you reach 
the end of a row, is as much a part of crocheting as the stitches themselves.
Feel free to let your creative impulses run wild. We give you the list of 
materials you need to make this scarf as it’s shown in the color section, but 
you can choose your own color or color combination using any worsted-
weight yarn. You can even add rows to make the scarf wider. Have fun and 
feel confident in your abilities to make this scarf your very own!

little dose of fringe. To add fringe to your scarf, cut your yarn into 12-inch 
lengths. Using two lengths of yarn for each fringe, single knot one fringe in 
each stitch across each short edge of the scarf. For more about fringes, check 
out Chapter 18.

rocheting would be pretty boring if all you could make were squares 
and rectangles. Sure, you could make armloads of scarves or afghans, 
but you probably want to branch out and create some shape. In this chapter, 
we show you how to widen and narrow your designs by simply adding or 
taking away a few stitches.
Note: This chapter shows you how to increase and decrease with single 
crochet stitches (see Chapter 5) or double crochet stitches (see Chapter 6), 
but you work increases and decreases with other stitches exactly the same 
way. Most patterns explain how to work the increases and decreases neces-
sary for that particular design, so be sure to read all the pattern instructions 
before beginning.
 
When increasing or decreasing stitches, always count your stitches to make 
sure you have the correct number on your work.

118
Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
Making It Grow: Increasing Stitches
Increasing stitches (abbreviated inc) is just what it sounds like: You add stitches 
to a row so that it has more stitches than the previous one in order to broaden 
the shape of your design. Depending on the type of design you’re making, 
you can increase stitches anywhere in the row — at the beginning, end, or 
middle; in every other stitch; or any place where you want the shaping to 
occur. If you’re working from a pattern, it’ll always tell you exactly where to 
place your extra stitches. No guesswork necessary!
 
Adding a stitch at the beginning or end of a row is a common way to increase 
stitches while working in rows. This method creates a smooth, tapered edge 
to your piece. Adding stitches to the middle of a row makes the shaping more 
subtle, allowing your piece to bend or angle out from the center, as with many 
shawl patterns.
Regardless of where the increase occurs, you usually make it by working two 
or more stitches into one stitch. Most stitches, no matter how tall they are, 
have the same steps for working an increase in the middle or end of a row. 
Working an increase at the beginning of a row of single crochet, however, is a 
little different than with the taller stitches.
In the following sections, we show you how to increase with single crochet 
and double crochet at the beginning of a row. Keep in mind that increases at 
the beginning of a row for stitches taller than single crochet are worked in the 
same way as the double crochet, counting their own specific turning chain as 
the first stitch of the increase (flip to Chapter 5 for more on turning chains).
 
If you’re working in rounds, increasing usually occurs in each successive 
round to accommodate the larger circumference of the design. See Chapter 8 
for more on working in rounds.
Increasing anywhere with single crochet
Because the turning chain in a single crochet row doesn’t count as a stitch, 
increasing one single crochet at the beginning of a row is the same as doing it 
in the middle or at the end of a row. Wherever you want to increase one single 
crochet (the pattern will tell you where to do this), just work two single cro-
chet stitches in the designated stitch, like in Figure 7-1a. Figure 7-1b illustrates 
a completed single crochet increase, and Figure 7-1c shows the stitch symbol 
you’d see in a diagram.

Increasing with double crochet 
at the beginning of a row
If the pattern calls for an increase in stitches at the beginning of a row and 
you’re working with stitches taller than single crochet, adding stitches to the 
beginning of a row is a little different than adding them in the middle or at 
the end. The main difference is that taller stitches require a turning chain 
at the beginning of a row. To figure out how to add one double crochet 
stitch at the beginning of a row, make a swatch of double crochet stitches 
and then follow these steps:
 
1. Chain 3 (ch 3).
 
 This is the same number of chains required for a double crochet turning 
chain, which counts as the first stitch.
 
2. Work your next double crochet stitch (dc) into the first stitch of the row.
 
 The first stitch of the row is the stitch directly below the turning chain, the 
one that you usually skip — see Figure 7-2a. Check out the completed 
stitch in Figure 7-2b and its symbol as you’d see it in pictorial crochet 
diagrams in Figure 7-2c. Note: The stitch you make in this step is the 
increase stitch.
 
3. Finish the rest of the row as you normally would, working 1 double 
crochet stitch in each stitch across the row.
 
 To double-check your work, count your stitches (including the turning 
chain). You should have 1 more stitch in this row than you have in the 
previous row.

Increasing with double crochet 
in the middle or end of a row
Sometimes a pattern may call for an increase at the end of a row or while 
you’re working your way across a row. Basically, you work an increase in 
the middle or at the end of a row the same way you work an increase at the 
beginning of a row, except you don’t have to worry about the turning chain. 
See what we mean in the following instructions:
 
1. Work across your row until you get to the designated increase stitch 
or the last stitch of the row.
 
2. Work 2 double crochet stitches (dc) into the designated stitch.
 
 Figure 7-3a illustrates how to perform Step 2, and Figure 7-3b shows a 
completed increase in the middle of a row. Figure 7-3c is the symbol for 
a double crochet increase in the middle or end of a row as you’d see it in 
pictorial crochet diagrams.

Diminishing Results: Decreasing Stitches
When you want to shape your design so that it gets smaller, you need to 
decrease your stitches. You can decrease a stitch (abbreviated dec), which 
is really just subtracting a stitch, in the same places that you increase stitches — 
at the beginning or end of a row or somewhere in the middle. Decreasing takes 
a few more steps, but it’s really just as simple as increasing. In the following sec-
tions, we describe several useful methods for decreasing stitches.
Decreasing with single crochet
 
When a single crochet decrease is called for, the pattern will typically tell 
you where the decrease(s) should be made. You decrease single crochet 
stitches in the middle or end of a row by turning two separate stitches into 
one, which is a two-step process. But because of these two steps, you have 
to think ahead and start the first part one stitch before the actual decrease is 
designated in your pattern.
To begin the two-part process of turning two single crochet stitches into one, 
start the first single crochet as you normally would.
 
1. Insert your hook into the first stitch of the decrease.
 
2. Yarn over the hook (yo).

122
Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
 
3. Draw the yarn through the stitch.
 
 You should have 2 loops remaining on your hook.
With the two loops still on your hook, begin the second part of the decrease 
by working the second single crochet.
 
1. Insert your hook into the next stitch, as shown in Figure 7-4.
 
2. Yarn over the hook (yo).

3. Draw the yarn through the stitch.
 
 You should now have 3 loops on your hook.
 
4. Yarn over.
 
5. Draw the yarn through all 3 loops on your hook, just like in Figure 7-5a.
 
 Figure 7-5b shows 1 complete single crochet decrease, and Figure 7-5c 
denotes the stitch symbol for this action.

 Chapter 7: Shaping Up and Slimming Down: Increasing and Decreasing Stitches
Decreasing with double crochet
The double crochet decrease can be used in the middle of a row or round or 
at the beginning or end of a row or round (the pattern you’re working with 
should tell you exactly where). It’s almost identical to the single crochet 
decrease described in the preceding section except it has one more step.
Begin the first part of the decrease by starting the first double crochet as you 
would for a normal double crochet stitch.
 
1. Yarn over the hook (yo).
 
2. Insert your hook into the next stitch.
 
3. Yarn over.
 
4. Draw the yarn through the stitch.
 
 You should have 3 loops on the hook.
 
5. Yarn over.
 
6. Draw the yarn through the first 2 loops on your hook.
 
 As you can see from Figure 7-6, 2 loops remain on the hook.
 
Figure 7-6: 
Completing 
the first part 
of a double 
crochet 
decrease.
 
In the second part of the decrease, you work the second double crochet 
stitch and join it with the first to complete the decrease. (Note: At this point, 
your first stitch is actually a half-closed stitch, in other words, one that has 
been partially completed.) With the two loops still on your hook, start to 
work the second double crochet stitch as you would a regular stitch.
 
1. Yarn over the hook (yo).
 
2. Insert your hook into the next stitch, as shown in Figure 7-7.
 
3. Yarn over.

Figure 7-7: 
Beginning 
the second 
part of a 
double 
crochet 
decrease.
 
 
4. Draw the yarn through the stitch.
 
 You should now have 4 loops on your hook.
 
5. Yarn over.
 
6. Draw the yarn through the first 2 loops on your hook.
 
 Three loops should still be on your hook.
 
7. Yarn over.
 
8. Draw the yarn through all 3 loops on your hook, like in Figure 7-8a.
 
 If you look at the tops of the stitches in Figure 7-8b, you see only 
1 stitch across the top of the 2 underlying stitches. This is 1 com-
plete double crochet decrease. Figure 7-8c introduces you to the stitch 
symbol for this particular decrease.
 
If you want to decrease at the very beginning of a row and you’re working with 
a stitch that requires a turning chain (in other words, a double crochet stitch 
or anything taller), you work the decrease a little differently than one in the 
middle or at the end of a row. Make your turning chain a stitch shorter than 
you normally would (for example, chain 2 rather than 3 for a double crochet) 
and then continue across the row as normal. When you work the next row, 
don’t work a stitch in the shortened turning chain. This process takes care of 
the decrease and leaves a smooth edge.
To avoid this kind of a decrease at the beginning of a double crochet row, 
a pattern may place a decrease in the second and third stitch rather than 
in the first two stitches. The opposite end of the row would then have the 
decrease placed one stitch in from the end to be symmetrical with the 
beginning of the row. This way you continue to work the turning chain and 
last stitch like usual and the decrease still falls toward the beginning and 
end of the row.

Decreasing with slip stitches 
at the start of a row
One handy method for decreasing at the beginning of a row is to slip stitch 
across the number of stitches that you want to decrease. You use this 
method when you need to decrease more than just one or two stitches, typi-
cally for shaping the armholes or neck edges in a garment. The resulting look 
is a squared-off corner.
To find out exactly how decreasing with slip stitches works, take a swatch 
of double crochet stitches and work the following steps to decrease three 
stitches at the beginning of a row:
 
1. Work 1 slip stitch (sl st) in each of the first 4 stitches.
 
 Head to Chapter 5 for instructions on working a slip stitch.
 
2. Chain 3 (ch 3) for the turning chain, which also counts as the first 
double crochet stitch (dc).
 
3. Skip the stitch under the turning chain and then work a double 
crochet in the next stitch.
 
4. Continue to work a double crochet in each stitch across the row.
 
 Figure 7-9 shows you how this decrease should look.

Decreasing by skipping stitches
Skipping stitches is an easy way to decrease stitches in a row. It’s an espe-
cially good tactic when you’re shaping armholes or necklines, but you can 
actually decrease by skipping stitches anywhere in the row — at the begin-
ning, middle, or end. You can skip any number of stitches, but the more you 
skip, the larger the gap created by the skipped stitches will be. That’s why 
decreasing by skipping stitches works best when you’re dealing with single 
crochet stitches.
 
To decrease by skipping stitches, simply work to the stitch the pattern tells 
you to decrease. Then skip the designated stitch, working the stitch before 
and after it as usual.
Decreasing by stopping and turning 
before you reach the end of a row
An alternate method of decreasing stitches at the end of a row is to just stop 
before you get to the last stitch. This technique, which can be used with any 
stitch, gives you a rather squared-off look and is quite often used when shaping 
garments. Here’s how to perform this pretty simple decreasing tactic:
 
1. Work across the row until you have the number of stitches that your 
work requires.
 
2. Stop crocheting and turn your work, leaving the remaining stitches on 
the current row unworked.
 
 Refer to Chapter 5 for instructions on properly turning your work.

127
 Chapter 7: Shaping Up and Slimming Down: Increasing and Decreasing Stitches
 
3. Make your turning chain and then work back across the previous row 
in the same manner as if you’d crocheted all the way to the end.
 
 Figure 7-10 shows this decrease after you’ve turned your work.

Simple Ripple Blanket Project
Practice your new shaping skills with this fun, colorful blanket, which you 
can check out in the color section. The larger size is perfect for a twin size 
bed, or even as a cozy throw to brighten up your couch, but you can easily 
change the size by using the optional instructions we provide. The gentle 
waves in the pattern are shaped by alternating an even number of increase 
stitches with decrease stitches so you always end each row with the same 
number of stitches.
 
The easy-care acrylic yarn used to make this blanket comes in a wide variety 
of colors, so feel free to play with the number of colors and the size of each 
color block. You can even change up the brand of yarn if you want to. Just 
make sure that the yarn you buy is the same size and weight as the yarn noted 
in the pattern (see Chapter 2 for more on yarn substitution) and that you can 
come up with the right gauge. (Find out all about gauge in Chapter 3.)

W
ho says that going in circles doesn’t get you anywhere? Obviously 
that person has never crocheted! Whether you want to make a stylish 
hat to wear throughout the year or a cute stuffed toy to give to your niece for 
her birthday, you need to be able to crochet a circle by working in rounds.
Crocheting rounds is no more difficult than working rows. Instead of work-
ing back and forth, you work around in a circle, increasing the number of 
stitches you work in each round to accommodate the growing circumference. 
This chapter shows you three common methods for creating a center ring, 
which is the basis for all rounds, and how to work rounds of stitches off of it. 
We also describe how to work in a spiral and make three-dimensional shapes.
Practice your new skills on the cute Bucket Hat project at the end of this 
chapter. Then, after you’ve mastered working in rounds, try your hand at our 
Amigurumi Pup project, a little stuffed dog guaranteed to warm your heart.
Lord of the Center Rings
To begin a design that you work in rounds, you must first create a center 
ring. The center ring is the foundation for all crocheted designs that are 

132
Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
worked in rounds — just like the foundation chain you use when working in 
rows (see Chapter 5). The three most frequently used methods for creating a 
center ring are as follows:
 
✓ Working chain stitches into a ring
 
✓ Working a round of stitches into one chain stitch
 
✓ Working stitches into an adjustable loop of yarn
The following sections show you these three methods, when you want to use 
each, and how to end a round and be in the proper position to start the next 
round.
Joining chain stitches into a ring
 
The most common method for creating a center ring is to make a chain and 
close it into a ring with a slip stitch. (See Chapter 5 for the how-to on making 
chain stitches and slip stitches.) Use this method when your first round is 
made up of a fairly large number of stitches and you need the room in which 
to fit them, or if the design calls for an obvious hole in the center of the piece.
The next sections explain how to create the center ring and work your first 
round off of that ring.
Making a center ring
The following steps show you how to create a simple center ring of six chain 
stitches:
 
1. Chain 6 (ch 6).
 
2. Insert your hook from front to back into the first chain stitch you 
made, as shown in Figure 8-1, in order to form a ring.
 
Figure 8-1:

133
 Chapter 8: I’ve Been Here Before: Crocheting in Circles
 
3. Yarn over your hook (yo).
 
4. Draw the yarn through the stitch and through the loop on your hook, 
like in Figure 8-2a.
 
 Your center ring is now complete. It should look like the one in 
Figure 8-2b.
 
Figure 8-2: 
Completing 
the center 
ring.
 a
b
 
The number of stitches in the beginning chain determines the size of the 
hole that the center ring creates, as well as how many stitches you can work 
into the center ring. Make sure the ring is large enough to accommodate the 
number of stitches you’ll be working in it. On the other hand, make sure it’s 
not so long that you have a big loose hole in the center. Note: When you’re 
working a pattern, it tells you how many chain stitches you need for the 
proper-size center ring.
Working the first round
After you make the center ring, you’re ready to crochet your first round. 
Just as when you’re beginning a new row, you first need to determine the 
number of turning chain stitches necessary in order to bring your hook up 
to the proper level for the next round of stitches. (The number of turning 
chains you need depends on the stitch you’re about to work; Chapter 5 has a 
chart that shows how many turning chain stitches the basic crochet stitches 
require.)
Now here’s the really easy part about working with a center ring: Instead of 
inserting your hook into the actual stitches of the center ring, just go through 
the center hole! The following steps show you how to work single crochet 
stitches into the center ring:
 
1. Chain 1 (ch 1) to make the turning chain for single crochet (sc).
 
2. Insert your hook into the center ring so that the hook end is behind 
the ring. (See Figure 8-3a.)

4. Draw the yarn through the center ring to the front of the ring. (Refer 
to Figure 8-3b.)
 
5. Yarn over the hook.
 
6. Draw the yarn through the 2 loops on your hook.
 
 Your first completed single crochet stitch should look like the one in 
Figure 8-4a, where the arrow shows how you must insert the hook for 
the next stitch.

b
Continue to work single crochet stitches into the ring until you can’t fit any-
more (see Figure 8-4b for the visual). You may fit in more stitches than you 
expect because the center ring will stretch somewhat.
Working stitches in the chain stitch
 
The second most common method for creating a center ring is to work all the 
stitches for the first round in one chain stitch. You generally use this method 
when the design calls for a small hole in the center of the pattern or almost no 
hole at all.

135
 Chapter 8: I’ve Been Here Before: Crocheting in Circles
To start a center ring this way, chain one stitch (this is what you work the 
stitches in) plus the number of stitches required for the turning chain, 
depending on which particular stitch you work in the first round. (See 
Chapter 5 for a list of the most common turning chain lengths.)
Follow these steps to work your first round of double crochet stitches into 
a chain stitch. Note: We chose the double crochet as our starting stitch, but 
the process works the same whichever stitch you choose to start with.
 
1. Chain 1 (ch 1).
 
2. Chain 3 more for the double crochet stitch’s (dc) turning chain.
 
3. Yarn over the hook (yo).
 
4. Insert your hook into the fourth chain from the hook, as shown in 
Figure 8-5.
 
 This is the first chain stitch you made; it becomes your center ring chain 
stitch.
 
Figure 8-5: 
Inserting the 
hook into 
your first 
chain stitch.

5. Work 1 complete double crochet stitch in the center ring chain stitch.
 
 Do this by yarning over, drawing the yarn through the center ring chain 
stitch, yarning over, drawing the yarn through the first 2 loops on the 
hook, yarning over, and drawing the yarn through the first 2 loops on 
the hook. (See Chapter 6 for more on how to make a double crochet 
stitch.)
 
6. Continue working double crochet stitches in the same center ring 
chain stitch until you’re comfortable with the process.
 
 For the next stitch, yarn over, insert your hook into the center ring chain 
stitch, and complete the stitch as you would a regular double crochet. 
Figure 8-6a shows you how to begin the third stitch, and Figure 8-6b 
shows a growing number of completed stitches.
 
 The turning chain for double crochet stitches worked in the round 
always counts as the first stitch.

Working stitches in an adjustable ring
 
The third most common method for creating a center ring is to work your 
first round of stitches into an adjustable ring. An adjustable ring allows you to 
make any number of stitches in the first round of a circle because the begin-
ning loop can slide open or closed as needed. After you’ve made your adjust-
able ring, work the first round of stitches into the center and then pull the tail 
end until the center is closed. Use this method when you want the hole at the 
center of a project to be completely closed.
You can work an adjustable ring with any stitch; just remember to work the 
required number of turning chains before working your first stitch into the 
ring (see Chapter 5 for a refresher on turning chains). Follow these steps to 
work one round of single crochet into the center of an adjustable ring:
 
1. Leaving a 2-inch tail, make a loop by crossing the working end of the 
yarn over the tail end and pinching the loop where the ends cross 
with the thumb and index finger of your nondominant hand.
 
 The working end is the one attached to the ball of yarn. Figure 8-7a 
shows what this step looks like.
 
2. Insert your hook through the center of the ring.
 
3. Yarn over (yo) with the working end of the yarn and draw the yarn 
through the ring as shown in Figure 8-7b.
 
 You now have 1 loop on your hook.
 
4. Chain 1 (ch 1).
 
 This is the turning chain for a single crochet (sc).
 
5. Insert the hook through the center of the ring, yarn over, and draw up 
a loop (see Figure 8-8a).
 
 You now have 2 loops on your hook.

6. Yarn over and draw the yarn through both loops on your hook.
 
 One single crochet in the center of the ring is now complete (see Figure 8-8b).
 
7. Work 5 more single crochets in the center of the ring and then pull 
the tail end of the yarn until the center of the ring is closed.
 
 Figure 8-8c shows 6 single crochet stitches in an adjustable ring with the 
tail end pulled tight to close the hole at the center of the ring.

Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
Uniting Your Ring
After you complete the number of stitches you need for your first round, you 
must join the first and last stitch of the round to complete the circle. The 
most popular way of doing that is by working a slip stitch in the top of the 
round’s first stitch; doing so puts you in the proper position to begin the next 
round. You join each successive round in the same place, which creates a 
slightly visible seam (to make a round without a seam, see the later section 
“Another Option: Spiraling Up and Up”).
You join single crochet rounds a little bit differently than rounds of other 
stitches, so we show you one example of each in the following sections.
Single crochet
To join a round of single crochet stitches, proceed as follows:
 
1. After completing the last single crochet (sc) of the round, insert your 
hook under the top 2 loops of the first single crochet stitch you made.
 
 The chain-1 turning chain at the beginning of a single crochet round 
doesn’t count as a stitch, so skip over it and work the slip stitch in the 
first single crochet.

Double crochet and other stitches
To join a round of double crochet (or any other stitch) you must
 
1. Insert your hook in the top of the turning chain after completing the 
last double crochet (dc) of the round.
 
 Note that the turning chain counts as the first stitch of the round.
 
2. Yarn over the hook (yo).
 
3. Draw the yarn through the turning chain and the loop on your hook to 
complete 1 slip stitch (sl st), as shown in Figure 8-10a.
 
 You’ve just joined the first round of double crochet. Figure 8-10b is a 
stitch diagram depicting the placement of the joining slip stitch, which 
is the dot at the top, by the turning chain. (Not sure how to read stitch 
diagrams? Refer to Chapter 4.)

Adding Rounds
Adding rounds to your work is similar to adding rows, except that you usu-
ally don’t turn your work and you increase the number of stitches you work 
in each round so that the piece lies flat. (See Chapter 7 for how to work an 
increase.)
The method of working subsequent rounds of stitches is the same for all 
stitches except the single crochet, as you discover in the following sections. 
However, the number of stitches you start with changes depending on the 
height of the stitch you’re working with. Taller stitches, such as double and 
triple crochet, require more stitches in each round because the circumfer-
ence of the circle they create is larger than a circle created with shorter 
stitches. The pattern you’re working with should tell you how many stitches 
to work for your project.

140
Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
 
The slip stitch that joins each round doesn’t count as a stitch (regardless of 
whether you’re working in single crochet or a taller stitch). When you join the 
last stitch to the first stitch, make sure you’re working the slip stitch into the 
first stitch of the round and not the slip stitch from the previous round. So 
that you don’t accidentally work stitches into the slip stitch, be sure to count 
your stitches at the end of each round to ensure you have the correct amount.
The second round of single crochet
Working rounds of single crochet is different than most other stitches 
because the turning chain doesn’t count as a stitch. To work a second round 
of single crochet, follow these steps:
 
1. After joining the first round, chain 1 (ch 1) for the turning chain.
 
2. Without turning your piece, work 2 single crochet stitches (sc) under 
the top 2 loops of the first stitch.
 
 The first stitch is the one directly below the turning chain; it’s the same 
stitch you worked the joining slip stitch into.
 
3. Work 2 single crochet stitches in each stitch around.
 
4. Join the first and last stitch of the round with a slip stitch (sl st).
The second round of double crochet
When working rounds of taller stitches, remember that the turning chain 
does in fact count as the first stitch. To work the second round of double 
crochet stitches, follow the instructions in the preceding section, but omit 
the chain 1 in Step 1 and substitute a chain 3 turning chain for the first stitch 
(see Chapter 5 for a refresher on turning chains). And, of course, use double 
crochet stitches in place of single crochet stitches.
 
For your piece to lie flat, the number of stitches in each round should increase 
by the number of stitches worked in the first round. (If you don’t increase 
enough stitches, your piece will begin to turn up in a cuplike shape.) For 
example, if your first round has a total of 6 stitches, then your second round 
should increase by 6 stitches for a total of 12 stitches. The third round should 
again increase by 6 stitches, giving you a total of 18 stitches at the end of the 
round.
Table 8-1 presents three different examples of round increases, as well how 
to work them.

These guidelines apply to one specific form of increasing in rounds. You can 
increase in rounds many different ways, although the principle of increasing 
in a regular sequence remains the same. Always follow whatever increasing 
instructions are provided in your pattern.
Because you don’t turn your work at the end of each round, you get a defi-
nite front and back to your piece. Figure 8-11a shows the right (front) side of 
a round. Notice how the stitches lean toward you? Figure 8-11b shows the 
wrong (back) side. It’s a little smoother, and the stitches angle away from you 
somewhat.
 
Figure 8-11: 
Two definite 
sides: 
(a) the right/
front side 
and 
(b) the 
wrong/back 
side.
 a
b
 
Sometimes, though, you want to avoid this front-and-back business and create 
a reversible fabric — especially for projects such as an afghan that you want 
to look good on both sides. To create a reversible fabric, just turn your piece 
after you’ve joined each round. (If you happen to forget this tip while working a 

142
Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
pattern that requires a reversible fabric, don’t worry. The directions will show 
you how to turn and where to work the stitches.) When you turn at the end of 
each joined round, be sure to skip the slip stitch and work your first stitch of 
the next round into the last stitch worked on the last round.
Another Option: Spiraling Up and Up
Working in a spiral is a way to crochet in rounds when you prefer not to have 
a visible seam. The usual reasons for working in a spiral are to make hats, 
mittens, bags, and toys with a three-dimensional shape. Another advantage 
of working in a spiral is that you don’t need to join the end of each round or 
make a turning chain; this perk makes crocheting items faster and neater. In 
the following sections, we introduce spiral basics and show you how to work 
one from a stitch diagram, such as you may find in a pattern you want to try.
 
Working tall stitches (like triple crochet) in a spiral gives your work an uneven 
edge. We recommend you use this technique only for single crochet stitches.
Working in a spiral
The first round of a spiral design begins the same way as any other round. 
You create a center ring by using one of the three methods described ear-
lier in this chapter and then work the required number of stitches in the 
first round. The stitch diagram in Figure 8-12 shows a center ring of 6 chain 
stitches and a first round of 12 single crochet stitches. (Chapter 4 has more 
on how to read a stitch diagram.) The twist comes in at the end of the round.
 
Figure 8-12: 
Single 
crochet 
stitch 
diagram for 
working in a 
spiral.
 
Instead of joining the round, you work the first stitch of the next round into 
the first stitch of the last round, and so on for each successive round. The 
only time you should slip stitch to complete the round is when you’ve fin-
ished the required number of rounds for the design. Reading the diagram in 

143
 Chapter 8: I’ve Been Here Before: Crocheting in Circles
Figure 8-12 counterclockwise, that means you work the 13th stitch in the first 
single crochet stitch of Round 1, skipping the turning chain from the first 
round. This now becomes the first stitch of the second round.
 
Before continuing on with Round 2, mark the first stitch of the second round 
with a stitch marker or a safety pin because losing your place or miscounting 
the stitches in each round is easy to do. (Stitch markers are handy gadgets 
that we mention in Chapter 2.) When you work your way back around, you 
work the first stitch of Round 3 into the marked stitch. Remove the marker 
from Round 2 and place it in the first stitch of Round 3. Continue spiraling until 
you’re too dizzy to go any further or until your design is the size you want.
Ending the spiral
The last stitch in the last round of a spiral design is raised above the level of 
the previous round. To finish the round and make the edge smooth, you need 
to slip stitch in the next stitch (the first stitch of the previous round) before 
fastening off. (We explain how to fasten off in Chapter 5.)
Adding Another Dimension
Not all designs that you work in the round have to be flat. A perfect example 
is the Bucket Hat project at the end of this chapter. It’s a flat round at the 
top, but then it takes on a tubular shape to fit over your head. If you’re wor-
ried that transforming a round shape into a tubular one is a difficult tech-
nique, don’t be — it’s actually easier than getting the darn round to lie flat in 
the first place! We explain what you need to know in the following sections.
 
You can make some fun three-dimensional projects with this shaping tech-
nique (think crocheted dolls and animals). You crochet the pieces into the 
proper shape and then stuff them with filling to make them soft and plump. 
(Why not try the Amigurumi Pup project at the end of this chapter? We 
describe this Japanese craft in a later sidebar.) Christmas ornaments, mittens, 
slippers, and leg warmers are just a few of the other multidimensional designs 
that you shape by working in rounds.
Starting to add dimension
In the earlier “Adding Rounds” section, you find out how to keep a round 
flat by increasing the number of stitches in each successive round. To get 
the round to start curving up, you simply stop adding new stitches in each 
round. Here’s how:

144
Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
 
1. Make a center ring of 6 chain stitches (ch) and work a complete round 
of 12 single crochet (sc). Join with a slip stitch (sl st).
 
 See the sections “Joining chain stitches into a ring” and “Uniting Your 
Ring,” earlier in this chapter, to find out how to perform this step.
 
2. Work 2 more rounds, increasing 12 stitches for Round 2 and 12 more 
stitches for Round 3, joining after each round.
 
 See the earlier “Adding Rounds” section for how to make the turning 
chain and add new rounds.
 
 You don’t have to stop after 3 rounds. Add more rounds to make a larger 
design, but keep increasing the stitches by 12 for each round.
 
3. To start adding depth, don’t add any extra stitches to Round 4. 
Instead, work 1 single crochet stitch in each stitch of the previous 
round and join with a slip stitch.
 
 Working 1 stitch in each stitch like this causes the edges of your work to 
turn in. Repeat Step 3 until the piece is as deep as you want.
 
If you want your piece to start curving in more gradually, don’t add as many 
increase stitches to the rounds in Step 2. Add a few so that the circumference 
grows, but not enough to keep it lying flat. Try adding just eight stitches to 
each round. Play around with the number of increases: The fewer you add, the 
more dramatic the curve; the more you add, the shallower the curve.
Deciding how to wrap up your work
After your work is as deep (or as long) as you want, you have three choices:
 
✓ Fasten off your work. You now have something that looks like a cap or 
a tube sock, depending on how big you made the initial flat round and 
how many rounds you added for depth.
 
✓ Begin increasing stitches in each round. This makes your piece begin 
to widen and flatten out, kind of like the brim on a hat.
 
✓ Begin decreasing stitches in each round. Decreasing the number of 
stitches starts to close up the edges of your piece, creating a spherical 
design. You decrease rounds the same way you decrease rows, by com-
bining two stitches into one. (Refer to Chapter 7 for more on decreasing.)
 
 Decreasing evenly in each successive round creates a smooth, even 
curve, but if you work a large number of decreases in one round, the 
work will pull in sharply. If you want your design to be symmetrical, 
decrease at the same rate as you increased on the first half of your 
piece.

Bucket Hat Project
The pattern for this versatile hat uses simple single crochet stitches and 
allows you to practice increasing in rounds. The yarn in this design, shown in 
the color section, is a cotton-wool blend that’s both soft and resilient, allow-
ing you to create a pretty accessory that can be worn throughout the year.
Amigurumi: The art of Japanese toy-making
Amigurumi is the popular Japanese craft of 
crocheting (or knitting) cute stuffed dolls. Most 
amigurumi projects tend to be animals (such as 
bears, cats, dogs, birds, or monkeys), but the 
craft is often seen giving other objects (such as 
cupcakes, milk cartons, eggs, and mushrooms) 
anthropomorphic features. In other words, the 
craft bestows human features upon animals 
and inanimate objects. No matter the subject, 
the main aesthetic goal of any amigurumi proj-
ect is to be sweet and cute.
Amigurumi is very simple in design and only a 
little more challenging in construction. The dolls 
are usually created with tight single crochet 
stitches (in order to keep any stuffing bits from 
coming through) that are worked in a spiral 
method to avoid a seam. The pieces and parts 
of the toys are worked separately and then 
sewn together at the end. Embellishments and 
facial features are added before the pieces are 
stuffed and finished.
Amigurumi patterns usually let you know 
exactly what you need to make the project, but 
here are a few basics you can expect to find in 
a typical pattern:
 ✓ Yarn: You can use any type of yarn, 
but amigurumi projects are usually made 
with worsted-weight acrylic, wool, or 
wool-blend yarns. Scraps of various colors 
may be used to add embroidery for the 
mouth or nose. Remember: The dolls are 
small, so you don’t need a ton of yarn; check 
your stash first before buying anything new.
 ✓ Hooks: Your stitches need to be tight so 
the stuffing doesn’t fall out, so the recom-
mended hook may be at least two sizes 
smaller than the one normally recom-
mended for the yarn.
 ✓ Notions: You’ll probably want a stitch 
marker to help you keep track of your 
rounds as well as a yarn needle to sew up 
the pieces and parts.
 ✓ Facial features: Many craft stores sell plas-
tic safety eyes and noses, which are great 
for toys that are given to children because 
they don’t pull off very easily. You can also 
use beads, buttons, crocheted circles, or 
embroidery.
 ✓ Stuffing: The most commonly used stuff-
ing is fiberfill, found at most craft stores, 
but you can also use fabric or yarn scraps. 
Plastic pellets or pony beads are sometimes 
added to give the toy weight. Whatever you 
opt for, don’t use rice or beans (which can 
attract bugs).

Amigurumi Pup Project
The pieces for this cute puppy (shown in the color section) are made using 
basic amigurumi skills — single crochet stitches worked in a spiral round — 
that allow you to practice increasing and decreasing to see how shaping 
occurs (check out the earlier section “Another Option: Spiraling Up and Up” 
for more info on working in a spiral). The yarn is a basic acrylic with a satin 
finish, but you can substitute almost any worsted-weight yarn.
 
The colors in this pattern were inspired by the Pug dog breed. However, if you 
substitute a furry white yarn for the tan color, you can easily transform this 
pup into a lamb! Flip to Chapter 9 to find out how to work with a main color 
(MC) and a contrasting color (CC).

Follow these steps to put your Amigurumi Pup together:
 
1. Stuff the body with fiberfill until firm.
 
2. Stuff each arm half full of fiberfill.
 
3. Pinch the opening of each arm together and line up the flattened edge 
to one side of the body opening.
 
4. Whipstitch the arms to each side of the body, inserting your needle 
under the top loops of the body and the top loops of the stitches on 
each side of the flattened edge of the arm.
 
5. Center the head on the opening of the body so that the puppy is facing 
you from a seated position and then thread the long tail of the body 
onto the yarn needle.

H
ave you ever stopped to imagine what the world would be like without 
color? Everywhere you look, from outside your windows to inside 
your home to the clothes on your body, color shapes your life and the way 
you view things. Well, the same holds true for the designs you crochet. Take, 
for example, an afghan. Worked in a single color, it provides warmth but 
not much else. Add one or more colors, though, and not only do you have a 
warm blanket to snuggle up with but you also have a work of art to display.
Whether you want to create a simple stripe pattern or a complex mosaic 
design in many colors, this chapter explains the various techniques for work-
ing with color and reading color charts. If you work the fun Mod Pillow proj-
ect at the end of this chapter, you can practice your newfound techniques.
Bringing Designs to Life: Joining Colors
Working color changes properly gives your finished project a smooth, clean 
appearance with no unsightly bumps and knots. You usually switch colors at 
one of two different places within your design:
 
✓ At the beginning (or end) of a row or round: You typically change 
colors at the beginning of a row when working a striped pattern. Of 
course, you can also look at this as changing color at the end of a row or 
round because the end of one is the beginning of another.
 
✓ In the middle of a row or round: For charted patterns, which have a pic-
ture in the middle of the design, you need to change colors in the middle 
of a row. (See the later section “Charting color change” for more details.)

156
Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
The next sections show you how to create a smooth, clean transition 
between colors regardless of whether you need to switch in the beginning, 
middle, or end of a row or round.
Changing color at the beginning (or end)
 
If you’re going for stripes, master changing colors at the beginning (or end) of 
a row because you’ll be doing this a lot. Fortunately, you change colors at the 
beginning (or end) of a row or round the same way you join a new strand of 
yarn of the same color — by making the change while working the last stitch of 
the previous row or round. (Need a refresher on joining yarn? See Chapter 6.)
Practice this technique by crocheting a swatch of double crochet several 
rows long with your first color; then follow these steps to join the new color:
 
1. Using the first color, double crochet (dc) in each stitch across to the 
next-to-last stitch of the row.
 
2. Work the last double crochet to the point where only 2 loops are left 
on the hook.
 
3. Drop the first yarn color and pick up the second color.
 
4. Wrap the end of the second yarn color around the hook.
 
5. Draw the second yarn color through the 2 loops of the first yarn color 
that are on your hook, as in Figure 9-1.
 
 At this point, you should have 2 strands of yarn hanging down.
 
6. Tug on the end of the first color at the base of the double crochet to 
tighten up the stitch.
 
Figure 9-1: 
Joining a 
new color at 
the begin-
ning (or end) 
of a row.
 

157
 Chapter 9: Crocheting in Technicolor
 
If you plan to pick up the first color in a later row, leave the first color of yarn 
hanging and continue on with the second color. (See the section “Hitching a 
Ride: Carrying the Yarn,” later in this chapter, to find out what to do with the 
unused first color strand of yarn.) If you don’t plan to pick up the first color 
in a nearby row, cut the yarn (after joining the second color as explained in 
Step 5 of the preceding list). Be sure to leave a 6-inch tail for weaving in later.
To hide the tail end of the first yarn color, lay it across the tops of the 
stitches in the previous row and work over it or weave it in with a yarn 
needle when you finish crocheting.
 
When you join a new yarn color, always finish the last stitch of the first color 
with the second color, regardless of the type of stitch you’re working. Doing 
so gets you ready to start the first stitch of the second color with the correct 
color loop on your hook, thereby preventing color drag, which happens when 
part of a stitch is one color and the rest of the stitch is another color. This 
holds true regardless of where the color change is made — at the beginning, 
end, or middle of a row or round.
Changing color midstream
If you’re making a design with a picture in the middle (a charted pattern), you 
change colors in the middle of a row. As when changing colors at the begin-
ning of a row, correctly switching to a new color is important in order to pre-
vent color drag.
Practice this technique by crocheting a swatch of double crochet several rows 
long with your first color. To add a new color within a row, follow these steps:
 
1. Work the last stitch prior to the stitch where you’re going to make the 
color change up to the point where only 2 loops are left on the hook.
 
2. Drop the first yarn color to the wrong (back) side and pick up the 
second color.
 
3. Wrap the end of the second yarn color around the hook.
 
4. Draw the second yarn color through the 2 loops (of the first yarn color) 
on your hook, thus completing the stitch with the second yarn color.
 
 Figure 9-2a illustrates what this step looks like. If you don’t plan to use 
the first color of yarn in the next few rows, cut the yarn, leaving a tail. 
Fasten off the first color by drawing the tail end through the current 
stitch as described in the preceding section. Then work over this tail 
with the new color or weave it in later with a yarn needle.
 
5. Continue working with the new color of yarn, as in Figure 9-2b.

You can change color with either the right side or the wrong side of the work 
facing you. Just remember to drop the tail end of the first color of yarn to the 
wrong side, even if it’s the side of the work that’s facing you.
Hitching a Ride: Carrying the Yarn
When you’re crocheting with two or more colors, you often carry the yarn 
that you’re not presently working with to avoid having to fasten it off and 
rejoin a new strand each time you make a color change. As you find out in the 
following sections, you have several different options for carrying the yarn, 
each of which produces a different result.
 
If you’re carrying several different colors, you can end up with a tangled 
mess in seconds. The simple act of turning your work at the end of each row 
becomes a nightmare if you have many different balls of yarn attached to 
your work at the same time. For small areas of color, cutting off a few yards of 
the required color and winding it around a bobbin alleviates this mess. (See 
Chapter 2 for more on yarn bobbins.) For the most prominent colors, how-
ever, leave the whole skein intact.
Carrying on the wrong side
Carrying the yarn across the row on the wrong side of the fabric is prob-
ably the easiest method to use when working with different colors. When 
you’re working a design that changes colors fairly frequently, such as vertical 
stripes or multicolored charted designs, fastening off each color each time 
you have to change is too much of a hassle. It also produces an incredibly 
sloppy finished product.

159
 Chapter 9: Crocheting in Technicolor
To carry a strand on the wrong side of the fabric, work over the strand every 
few stitches with the second color, as shown in Figure 9-3. (Please note that 
Figure 9-3 shows the wrong side of the fabric.) To do this, lay the strand hori-
zontally across the tops of the stitches along the wrong side of the fabric. 
When you complete the next stitch, make sure to encase the yarn as you 
draw it through the first two loops.
 
Figure 9-3: 
Carrying 
a strand 
across the 
wrong side.
 
 
The wrong (back) side of your piece is facing you as you work every other 
row, so make sure you’re always carrying the yarn on the same side. If you’re 
changing color on a right (front) side row, you carry the first color on the 
wrong side of your work.
If you’ll be switching back to the carried color several times across the row, 
then carry the yarn all the way across. If the design is only in a particular sec-
tion of the work, such as a picture in the middle of a sweater back, carry the 
yarn only in the part of the row where the design is featured and then let it 
drop while you finish the row. When you work back across the row, the color 
will be available for you to pick up in the spot dictated by the design.
 
Keep the carried strand tight enough so that it lies flat against the wrong side 
of the fabric and doesn’t catch on anything, but don’t pull the strand too taut, 
or else the fabric can pucker.
Working over a carried strand
Working over the carried strand produces a neater appearance on the wrong 
side of the fabric, which is especially important in a design where the back-
side is visible, such as an afghan or a scarf.

160
Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
The technique for working over a carried strand is basically the same as 
working over the end of the yarn when joining a new ball in the middle of a 
row (refer to Chapter 6). Just lay the unused strand of yarn across the tops of 
the stitches of the previous row. Then, using the new color, work the stitches 
in the current row and encase the strand, as in Figure 9-4.
 
Figure 9-4: 
Working 
over a 
carried 
strand.
 
 
The carried color is sometimes slightly visible, depending on the type and 
color of the yarn and stitches you’re using. Don’t worry, though; more often 
than not this visibility adds depth and contrast to the design.
Carrying on the right side
 
The only reason you ever carry the yarn on the right side of the fabric is if the 
carried strand is an integral part of your design. For example, carrying a thin 
strand studded with sequins or mirrors across the right side can add fancy 
flash to a project made with otherwise simple yarn.
You carry the yarn across the right side the same way you carry it across the 
wrong side (as explained in the earlier “Carrying on the wrong side” section). 
However, you may want to catch the strand every other stitch or even every 
stitch, depending on the pattern, to make sure that no long, loose loops are 
hanging around. If your pattern calls for this carrying method, the instruc-
tions will indicate how often to catch the yarn.

161
 Chapter 9: Crocheting in Technicolor
Carrying up the side
 
Carrying the yarn up the side comes in handy when you’re working a horizon-
tal stripe pattern. However, this technique only works when you’re crochet-
ing stripes in even numbers of rows. If you’re working a stripe pattern that 
changes color every row, the carried yarn won’t be on the side you need it to 
be when you want to pick it up in the next row.
To carry a strand of yarn up the side edge of your work:
 
1. Work 2 rows in the first color, switching colors of yarn in the last 
stitch of the second row.
 
 To switch colors of yarn, follow the first set of steps in the earlier 
“Changing color at the beginning (or end)” section.
 
2. Work 2 rows with the second color.
 
3. Draw up the first color from 2 rows below to complete the last stitch 
of the second row (see Figure 9-5) and drop the second color, which 
you’ll pick up later.
 
 If you pull the strand too tightly up the side, your design will pucker.

the unused 
strand up

your work.

Part II: Basic Stitches and Techniques 
Demystifying Color Codes and Charts
Working with color has its own special language. To make the instructions 
more compact and concise, most instruction writers use abbreviations when 
referring to colorful designs. That’s why the sections that follow give you the 
skinny on deciphering color codes and reading color charts.
Abbreviating color names in patterns
When you first look at the instructions for a particular pattern, you obviously 
check to see what materials you need, including how many different colors 
of yarn the pattern uses. If the pattern involves two or more colors, you may 
see some funny letter designations after each color name.
Pairing up: Main color and contrasting color
If a pattern requires only two colors, the main color (abbreviated MC) is usu-
ally the first and most prominent color within the pattern. The contrasting 
color (CC) is the secondary color.
Careful coloration
Choosing different colors for a design may turn 
into a more daunting process than you origi-
nally bargained for. Here are some tips to make 
combining colors well a tad easier:
 ✓ Use a color wheel. This handy little gadget 
is available in most craft and yarn stores. 
Choose colors within the same segment to 
get several tones that work well together, 
or for a more vibrant look, choose colors 
that are exactly opposite each other on the 
color wheel.
 ✓ Pick a multicolored yarn and a solid color 
yarn. Many yarn companies create varie-
gated or multicolored yarns to coordinate 
with their solid colors. Choose a multicolored 
yarn that appeals to you and then match it 
up with a solid color yarn. Doing so gives the 
appearance of using many different yarns, 
when you actually use only two or three.
 ✓ Rely on basic white or off-white to add 
contrast. White and off-white work well 
with almost any other color. If you’re look-
ing for a stark contrast, go with a dark sec-
ondary color. A lighter color works fine if 
you want something subtler.
 ✓ Use dark and light tones of the same color. 
If you favor a particular color, why not use 
its many shades?

163
 Chapter 9: Crocheting in Technicolor
If the materials call for three skeins of white as the main color (MC) and two 
skeins of red as the contrasting color (CC) and the instruction is for a striped 
pattern, you may see something like this:
 
1. Row 2: With MC, ch 1, sc in each sc across, complete last st with CC, 
turn. Fasten off MC.
 
 Here’s what that gobbledygook means: Working with the main color 
(white), chain 1 and then work 1 single crochet stitch in each single cro-
chet stitch across until you reach the next-to-last stitch. Then work the 
last stitch, completing it with the contrasting color (red). Fasten off the 
main color (white). Then turn your work.
 
2. Row 3: With CC, ch 1, sc in each sc across, turn.
 
 Again, an English translation: Working now with the contrasting color 
(red), chain 1, work 1 single crochet in each single crochet stitch across 
the row, and then turn your work.
Three’s a crowd: Letter abbreviations
When a design calls for three or more colors, patterns use letters of the 
alphabet to designate the colors. For example, a materials list that calls for 
six different colors may appear like this:
4 balls of Yellow (A); 3 balls each of White (B), Green (C), and Blue (D); 1 
ball each of Pink (E) and Lilac (F)
Some patterns may use the initials of color names to abbreviate, such as 
G for green, W for white, and so on. Then again, sometimes a pattern has a 
main color (MC) along with several other colors designated A, B, C, and so 
on. Whichever abbreviation style they use, patterns usually list the yarns 
needed in order of appearance in the pattern or by the quantity required.
 
Be sure to read through the materials list at the beginning of each project so 
you’re familiar with the color abbreviations. You may want to write out a sepa-
rate list of the abbreviations and the color names to help keep things straight.
Charting color change
Many patterns use a color chart rather than written instructions to show 
designs that have frequent color changes or use several different colors. A 
color chart is a grid, with each square representing one stitch (see Figure 9-6a). 
Because most crochet publications are in black and white, symbols in each 
square indicate the different colors. Always refer to the chart key (which looks 
like Figure 9-6b) to determine which symbol stands for which color.

When reading a color chart, you generally read the odd-numbered rows from 
right to left and the even-numbered rows from left to right, unless otherwise 
specified. This is simply because you work your first row after the foundation 
chain from right to left and the second row from left to right. Figure 9-7 shows 
a swatch made from the chart in Figure 9-6a.

Crafty Math: Understanding 
the Fibonacci Sequence
Like it or not, math and crochet go hand in hand. From calculating gauge 
(explained in Chapter 3) to determining how to work increases to make a flat 
or curved circle (described in Chapters 7 and 8), you use math whenever you 
pick up your hook. One important math concept, the Fibonacci sequence, 
actually allows you to add balance and interest in crochet patterns involving 
multiple colors.

165
 Chapter 9: Crocheting in Technicolor
The Fibonacci sequence is a simple series of numbers that follows a predict-
able pattern. Here’s the beginning of the basic sequence:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377 . . .
To break the pattern down, begin with the first two numbers and add them 
together to get the third number: 0 + 1 = 1. Next, add the previous two num-
bers in the sequence to get the fourth number: 1 + 1 = 2. Now the sequence 
reads 0, 1, 1, 2. Find the fifth number by adding the third and fourth numbers 
together: 1 + 2 = 3. As you can see, the Fibonacci sequence can go on indefi-
nitely as you continue to add the previous two numbers to find the next 
number in the series.
Many eye-pleasing objects in nature follow the Fibonacci sequence. Picture 
the number of petals on your favorite flower. Now count them. We bet you 
count three, five, or eight petals. Sequences can also occur in the arrange-
ment of petals on a pine cone or the spiraling rings of seeds at the center of a 
sunflower. If these sequences produce such an orderly appearance in nature, 
why not apply the same concepts to crochet?
 
To create an interesting color pattern in your piece, simply apply the basic 
Fibonacci sequence using two or more colors, as shown in the Mod Pillow 
project at the end of this chapter. You can apply part of the sequence to the 
number of rows or stitches in a pattern. For example, you can use a 1-1-2 
pattern or a 2-3-5-8-13 pattern. (Note: You can also create texture patterns 
using the same concept and a variety of basic stitches.)
All patterns involving multiple colors will instruct you on how to create the 
color patterns for the piece, but you can make a project your own by choos-
ing the colors that reflect your style or by substituting your own Fibonacci 
sequence.
Mod Pillow Project
One side of this contemporary pillow allows you to master the technique of 
changing color; the other side uses a Fibonacci sequence to determine the 
number of rows for each stripe in the following order: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. The rec-
ommended worsted-weight yarn is easy to work with and comes in a bounti-
ful array of colors. Use those shown in the color section, or choose colors 
that suit your décor and let the Fibonacci sequence do all the work of coordi-
nating them for you.

on a few simple stitches (Chapters 5 and 6 show you how to create these 
basic stitches). In this chapter, we show you how to combine them to make 
pattern stitches, such as shells and clusters, and textured stitches, such 
as bobbles, popcorns, and loops. Along with illustrations of the completed 
stitches, we give you the International Crochet Symbol for each stitch so 
you’re prepared to read stitch diagrams whenever you encounter them (see 
Chapter 4 for the basics of stitch diagrams). The Elegant All-Season Wrap 
project at the end of this chapter incorporates many of the fancy stitches we 
show you in the following pages so you can practice them while creating a 
beautiful accessory.
Spicing Things Up with Pattern Stitches
The versatile V-stitch, crossed double crochet, shell, cluster, picot, and 
reverse single crochet stitches can create stitch designs that are open and 
lacy or tight and compact. As you become familiar with these stitches, you’ll 
recognize them in numerous patterns that span the range from home décor 
to fashion.
 
As you branch out in the crocheting world, you’ll probably come across varia-
tions of the pattern stitches in this section. So don’t assume that you always 
work a cluster stitch exactly as we define it here. Trust your pattern instruc-
tions; they usually tell you exactly how to work a pattern stitch, so be sure to 
carefully read the notes at the beginning.

Showing the V: The V-stitch
The V-stitch (abbreviated V-st) combination got its name because it resembles 
(guess what?) a V. To create a V-stitch, work one double crochet stitch, 
chain one, and then work another double crochet stitch all in the same stitch 
(check out Figure 10-1a to see a completed V-stitch). In Crochetese, that’s 
(Dc, ch 1, dc) in the same stitch. Figure 10-1b shows the International Crochet 
Symbol for the V-stitch.

Seeing XXXs: The crossed 
double crochet stitch
For the crossed double crochet stitch (abbreviated crossed dc), you work two 
double crochet stitches on an angle, producing a pattern that looks like an X. 
To make a crossed double crochet stitch, follow these steps:
 
1. Skip the next stitch in the row.
 
2. Work 1 double crochet (dc) in the next stitch.
 
3. Working behind the double crochet you just made, work 1 double cro-
chet in the stitch that you skipped, as shown in Figure 10-2a.
 
 Keeping the double crochet stitch you just made in front of your hook, 
insert your hook from front to back in the specified skipped stitch. 
Figure 10-2b illustrates the completed stitch, and Figure 10-2c denotes 
the symbol for the crossed double crochet stitch.
To continue working crossed double crochet stitches across the row, repeat 
Steps 1 through 3.

173
 Chapter 10: Fancy Stitches That Steal the Show
 
Some patterns using the crossed double crochet stitch may specify that you 
work the second double crochet in front of the first, or even wrapped around 
the first (having the second double crochet enclose the first). That’s all the 
more reason to read your pattern’s instructions so you can crochet the way it 
wants you to from the start.

Spreading out: The shell stitch
The shell stitch (abbreviated shell) is very versatile, and you can find it just 
about anywhere. The variation we describe here is one common version 
of this adaptable stitch. To make a shell stitch, work four double crochet 
stitches in the same stitch (see Figure 10-3a for the completed stitch and 
Figure 10-3b for the stitch symbol).

Part III: Advanced Stitches and Techniques 
Usually the base of a shell stitch is surrounded by unworked stitches. 
However, most shell stitch patterns make sure that the total number of 
stitches is either the same or close to the same as the number of stitches in 
the previous row.
Grouping multiple like stitches: 
The cluster stitch
A cluster (no abbreviation) is a set of stitches that you work across an equal 
number of stitches and join together at the top, forming a triangle shape 
that resembles an upside-down shell stitch. (In fact, many crocheters use 
this stitch combination in conjunction with shells.) To make a cluster of four 
double crochet stitches, work through the following steps:
 
1. Yarn over (yo), insert the hook into the next stitch, yarn over, draw 
the yarn through the stitch, yarn over, and draw the yarn through 2 
loops on the hook (2 loops should remain on the hook, as shown in 
Figure 10-4a).
 
 One half-closed double crochet is now complete. A half-closed stitch is one 
that’s only worked partway and then finished at the end of the combination.
 
2. Repeat Step 1 three times (see Figure 10-4a).
 
 You should end up with 5 loops on your hook, like in Figure 10-4b.
 
3. Yarn over and draw the yarn through all 5 loops on the hook (refer to 
Figure 10-4b).
 
 Well done. You’ve just completed one 4-double-crochet (4-dc) cluster. 
See Figure 10-5a for a visual of what the completed cluster should look 
like and Figure 10-5b for its symbol.

Getting decorative: The picot stitch
Picots (no abbreviation) are pretty little round-shaped stitches that add a 
decorative touch to an edging or fill an empty space in a mesh design. You 
see them quite often in thread crochet, but you can also make them with 
yarn. To make a picot, follow these steps:
 
1. Chain 3 (ch 3).
 
2. Insert your hook into the third chain from the hook, as shown in 
Figure 10-6a.

Working backward: The reverse 
single crochet stitch
The reverse single crochet stitch (abbreviated reverse sc) is sometimes called 
the crab stitch. The mechanics are the same as for a regular single crochet — 
except in reverse. Instead of working from right to left, you work from left to 
right. This stitch creates a somewhat twisted, rounded edge that’s good for 
making a simple finished edge for your work. Note: You usually don’t work 
stitches into the tops of the reverse single crochet, so you won’t find this 
stitch in the middle of a project.
To work reverse single crochet, follow these steps:
 
1. With the right side of your work facing you, insert the hook from front 
to back in the next stitch to the right, as shown in Figure 10-8a.
 
2. Yarn over (yo) and draw the yarn through the stitch, as in Figure 10-8b.

Moving into the Third Dimension 
with Texture Stitches
If you want to add even more pizzazz to your crocheting, the three-dimensional 
stitch combinations in the following sections create great textures in your 
crocheted fabric. You can interchange the first three stitches because they all 
look like different versions of a bumpy oval. The last one, the loop stitch, cre-
ates long, fun loops that come in handy when making toys, sweaters, slippers, 
and wall hangings.
 
Because stitches aren’t standardized in any way, you may come across many 
different names for them. For example, puff stitches are sometimes referred 
to as bobbles, even though they’re created in completely different ways. So 
always read the specifics for each stitch before beginning your work.

178
Part III: Advanced Stitches and Techniques 
Gently bumping along: The bobble stitch
The bobble stitch (no abbreviation) creates a smooth, oval bump and works 
well with a heavier-weight yarn. Making a bobble stitch is similar to making a 
cluster (which we describe earlier in this chapter) in that you half-close several 
stitches worked in the same stitch and then join them together to finish the 
stitch. To make a 3-double-crochet bobble stitch, follow these simple steps:
 
1. Yarn over (yo), insert your hook into the stitch, yarn over, draw the 
yarn through the stitch, yarn over, and draw the yarn through the 2 
loops on your hook.
 
 One half-closed double crochet is now complete. You should still have 2 
loops on your hook, like in Figure 10-10a.
 
Figure 10-10:

a bobble 
stitch.

2. In the same stitch, repeat Step 1 twice.
 
 You should now have 4 loops on your hook, as in Figure 10-10b.
 
3. Yarn over and draw the yarn through all 4 loops on the hook (refer to 
Figure 10-10b).
 
 One 3-double-crochet bobble stitch is now complete. Take a look at 
Figure 10-11a for the completed stitch and Figure 10-11b for the stitch 
symbol.

179
 Chapter 10: Fancy Stitches That Steal the Show
In some instances, the bobble stitch may be made with more than three 
double crochet stitches, as in the Elegant All-Season Wrap project (featured 
later in this chapter), which uses four double crochet stitches to form the 
bobble stitch. To increase a 3-double-crochet bobble stitch to a 4-double-
crochet bobble stitch, simply work one more partial double crochet into 
the stitch and finish as you normally would. (Don’t worry that you’ll have to 
figure this type of thing out on your own. A good pattern always instructs you 
on exactly how to make specialized stitches such as the bobble stitch.)
Not a magic dragon: The puff stitch
A puff stitch (abbreviated puff st) is aptly named because it gently puffs up 
into an oval shape. The puff stitch differs slightly from other raised stitches 
because you make it with a series of loops rather than stitches. Follow these 
few steps to create a puff stitch:
 
1. Yarn over (yo) and insert your hook into the stitch (refer to 
Figure 10-12a).
 
Figure 10-12: 
Fashioning a 
puff stitch.
 a

2. Yarn over and draw the yarn through the stitch, bringing the loop up 
to the height of the previous stitch.
 
 You should have 3 loops on your hook, as shown in Figure 10-12b.
 
3. Working in the same stitch, repeat Steps 1 through 2 four times.
 
 At the end of this step, you should have 11 loops on your hook.
 
4. Yarn over and draw the yarn through all 11 loops on your hook, as in 
Figure 10-13a.
 
 Tada! You’ve just completed your first puff stitch. Check out Figure 
10-13b to see the completed stitch and Figure 10-13c for its symbol.

Puff stitches, clusters, bobbles, and popcorn stitches (see the next section), 
sometimes need an extra chain stitch at the top of the stitch to close them 
securely. If this is the case, your pattern should tell you so.
Forget the butter: The popcorn stitch
This stitch really pops! The popcorn stitch (abbreviated pop or pc) is a nicely 
rounded, compact oval that stands out from the fabric. It takes a bit more 
time to make than other raised stitches, but it’s well worth the effort. For 
even more fun, you can work popcorn stitches so that they “pop” to the front 
or the back of a fabric, depending on where you want them to stand out. The 
following steps show you how to work a 5-double-crochet popcorn stitch 
both ways.
To pop to the front of your design:
 
1. Work 5 double crochet stitches (dc) in the same stitch.
 
2. Drop the loop from your hook.
 
3. Insert your hook from front to back under the top 2 loops of the first 
double crochet of the group.
 
4. Grab the dropped loop with your hook and pull it through the stitch, 
as shown in Figure 10-14a.
 
 One front-popping popcorn stitch is now complete; it should look like 
the stitch in Figure 10-14b. Note that the stitch symbol shown in Figure 
10-14c is the same for a back or front popcorn.

Feeling loopy: The loop stitch
The loop stitch (no abbreviation) gets its name from the long, loose loops it 
leaves behind. Getting the loops to be all the same length takes some prac-
tice, but when you get the hang of it, the loop stitch adds a lot of interest to 
garments. It also works great to make a beard for Santa when worked in sev-
eral consecutive rows.
To create a loop stitch, work through the following steps:
 
1. Wrap the yarn from front to back over the index finger of your yarn 
hand.
 
 The length of the loop depends on how loosely or tightly you wrap the 
yarn in this step.
 
2. Insert your hook into the next stitch.
 
3. With your hook, grab the strand of yarn from behind your index 
finger.
 
4. Draw the yarn through the stitch, as shown in Figure 10-16a.

5. With the yarn loop still on your index finger, yarn over the hook (yo) 
and draw the yarn through the 2 loops on your hook (refer to Figure 
10-16b).
 
 One loop stitch is now complete. Figure 10-17a shows the completed 
stitch, and Figure 10-17b shows its symbol.
 
Make sure that all the loops you create are the same length in order to achieve 
a finished look.
 
After working an area of loop stitch, you can cut all the loops to create a 
shaggy dog look.

Elegant All-Season Wrap Project
This stylish project (which you can see in all its glory in the color section) 
lets you practice most of the stitches described in this chapter while creating 
a beautiful wrap that you can drape over your best dress for a night on the 
town or pair with your most comfortable jeans for a stroll on the beach. The 
suggested materials call for a cotton-blend yarn for the warmer seasons, but 
you can easily substitute a worsted-weight wool or a wool blend for the cooler 
months. As always, feel free to experiment with your own color preferences.

Directions
Work this project in three parts so that the stitches run outward from the 
center in opposite directions. Begin with the center strip, which consists of 
only two rows, and then work the first half of the pattern off of the center. 
Next, simply turn the crocheted piece so the foundation row is facing up. 
Then complete the second half (which is nearly identical to the first half) 
by working off of the foundation row. Crocheters use this method quite fre-
quently to create a symmetrical design.
Figure 10-18 presents you with the stitch diagram for the Elegant All-Season 
Wrap. The steps for this project follow, and they look just as you’d see them 
in a regular crochet publication. If you need to refresh your memory a bit of 
what all the abbreviations mean, flip to Chapter 4.

Creating Texture in 
Unexpected Ways
In This Chapter
▶ Working into different parts of a stitch
▶ Hooking outside the stitch
▶ Felting to create unique crocheted pieces
▶ Creating cool scarves and a fun bag
U
ntil now, you’ve been content making crochet stitches by inserting your 
hook through the top loops of the stitches in the previous row, over 
and over again. But now’s your chance to get a little crazy — instead of work-
ing a stitch in the top loops, insert your hook in the bottom loops, around the 
middle loops, or even in loops on the fronts or backs of stitches! This deviant 
behavior creates a variety of new textures and designs in your fabric.
This chapter shows you a few of the numerous ways you can create new tex-
tures in your crocheted pieces. To give your project a whole new look and 
feel, try shrinking it in the washing machine — a process called felting. Felting 
a crocheted item transforms your work from something that’s big, loose, and 
unstructured into a solid, durable, and functional original. The scarf and bag 
projects at the end of this chapter offer you a chance to practice all of these 
new techniques (and then some!).
 
As you get funky with your hook placement, keep in mind that a stitch is a 
stitch is a stitch. Regardless of where you insert your hook, you always work a 
particular stitch in the same way.
Switching Up Your Stitch Placement
Depending on the type of look you’re trying to achieve, you can work a stitch 
pretty much anywhere you can fit your hook — nothing is off-limits. Normally 
you work a new stitch into both top loops of a stitch you’ve already made, 

188
Part III: Advanced Stitches and Techniques 
but to switch things up, you can also work a new stitch into a single top 
loop, into the base, or into other loops on the front or back of your piece. 
In Chapter 5, we give you the lowdown on all the parts of a stitch; the next 
sections show you what you can do with them.
Working into the top and other loops
You can work one stitch into another in a few different ways, regardless 
of whether you’re working in rows or rounds, and each method creates a 
unique effect in your finished fabric. The resulting look can be either smooth 
or textured, depending on which loop you choose to use (see what we mean 
in Figure 11-1a; Figure 11-1b notes the symbols):
 
✓ Crocheting under both top loops: Working under both top loops is 
the typical way to crochet a stitch; it creates a smooth, flat fabric. We 
present this method in earlier chapters.
 
✓ Crocheting in the front loop only: Working under the front loop only 
creates a ridge on the opposite side of the fabric. This approach is great 
for making a rib at the bottom edge and cuffs of a sweater. Another 
reason to leave the back loop free is so you can work a stitch from a 
later row into it.
 
✓ Crocheting in the back loop only: Like front-loop-only stitching, working 
new stitches in the back loop creates a rib, except it’s on the opposite 
side of the fabric. You may also work in just the back loops when joining 
two pieces of crocheted fabric together (see Chapter 15 for the scoop on 
this technique). Leaving the front loops free when joining pieces together 
creates a decorative raised seam on the front of your work.
 
✓ Crocheting in a loop found on the front or back side of the stitch: 
Usually, you look at the stitch from the top to see the front and back 
loops; however, look at a stitch from the front (right) or back (wrong) 
side of the fabric, and you’ll find additional loops available for your use.
 
• Working stitches into a loop on the front side of the stitch pushes 
the top 2 loops outward to the back of the fabric and is referred to 
as the front-most loop (see Chapter 5).
 
• Working stitches into a loop on the back side of the stitch pushes 
the top 2 loops outward to the front of the fabric, creating a faux 
knit-like rib, and is called the back-most loop (see Chapter 5).
 
Working in just one loop at the top of a stitch adds a bit of stretch to your 
piece that working in both top loops just doesn’t offer. This flexibility comes 
in handy when you’re working with a yarn that doesn’t offer much elasticity, 
such as cotton, or when you’re making a rib around the bottom or cuff edges 
of a sweater where you want the fabric to have some stretch.

189
 Chapter 11: Creating Texture in Unexpected Ways
 
Working in the front or back loop of a stitch doesn’t necessarily designate the 
design’s front or back side. After you turn your work at the end of a row (see 
Chapter 5), the front loop on the previous row becomes the back loop on the 
current row.

Stitching up the sides
You often work around the side of a stitch when you’re adding a border to a 
crocheted item, smoothing out an edge, or joining two pieces of fabric. Only 
the stitches that are at the end of a row come into play, which is why most 
pattern instructions refer to working in the side of a stitch as working in row-
end stitches.
Figure 11-2 shows the proper placement for your hook in a row-end stitch. To 
avoid gaping holes across the edges, insert your hook where two stitches join 
together, whether at the base or the top of the stitches or both. You work the 
new stitch in the same way whether you’re working into a complete row-end 
stitch or a turning chain.

Bucking Tradition and Working Stitches 
in Spaces and Other Interesting Places
Who says you have to work in a stitch at all? You can create some nice stitch 
effects by working outside the box — or shall we say stitch? The following 
sections introduce you to working stitches into the spaces between stitches 
or those created by chain loops and working a stitch in and around the 
middle of another one.
Squeezing into spaces
Unlike the tight weave of knitted fabric, crocheted fabric has spaces between 
the stitches because they’re not linked on the sides, which unlocks a whole 
new world of opportunity in which to create new stitches. Even though the 
spaces between stitches aren’t always obvious, trust us, they’re there. In the 
sections that follow, we show you how to work in spaces between stitches 
and in chain spaces and loops.
Working in the spaces between stitches
Because crocheted stitches aren’t linked at the sides, you can work your 
stitches in between other stitches by inserting your hook into the space 
between two stitches rather than the loop(s) at the top of a stitch (see 
Figure 11-3). When you work in between stitches, you lower the base of the 
new stitch, altering the alignment of the row. You can use this technique to 
create a zigzag effect: Just work one stitch in between stitches and the next 
one in the top of the row. Or create a brick pattern by alternating every four 
stitches, for example, rather than every other one.
 
Working in between stitches is a great help when you’re using novelty yarns 
(see Chapter 2 for a description of these). Because highly textured yarns 
can make individual stitches hard to see, working between them keeps your 
design untangled and you out of the loony bin. You can make a whole design 
this way without ever working into the top of another stitch.

 Chapter 11: Creating Texture in Unexpected Ways
Working in chain spaces and loops
Many lacy patterns, such as filet crochet (see Chapter 13), use chain loops 
and spaces in their designs in order to achieve a loose, airy look. Although 
these loops and spaces may appear fancy and complicated, working a stitch 
into them is a piece of cake because you don’t have to be too particular about 
where you stick your hook. As long as it lands somewhere within the loop or 
space, you’re good to go. Figure 11-4 shows you where to put your hook.
 
Patterns identify the space or loop you’re supposed to work into by how many 
chain stitches were used to create it. For example, if you need to work into 
a space created by one chain, the pattern tells you to work into the chain-1 
space, which may be abbreviated as ch-1 sp. If you need to work into a loop 
created by five chain stitches, the pattern directs you to the chain-5 loop (or 
ch-5 lp for short).

Going around the middle with post stitches
You can insert your hook around the post (body) of a stitch that’s one or 
more rows below the current row to make — you guessed it — a post stitch. 
Post stitches create raised patterns, such as ribbing and cables. The way you 
insert your hook around the post determines whether you’re creating a front 
post or a back post. The following sections show you how to make both.
Front post stitches
Front post stitches are raised on the surface of the fabric facing you and have a 
ridge on the opposite side of the fabric. To create a front post double crochet 
(abbreviated FPdc), follow these steps:
 
1. Work a row of normal double crochet (dc) for the first row and turn.
 
2. Chain 2 (ch 2) for your first double crochet.

192
Part III: Advanced Stitches and Techniques 
 
 Because a post stitch is shorter than a normal stitch, you make the turn-
ing chain with 1 chain stitch less than the normal turning chain requires. 
(Chapter 5 covers the basics of turning chains.) In addition, the last 
stitch in the row may be a shorter stitch to keep the whole row level. For 
example, if you’re working a row of double crochet stitches in the front 
post of the stitches from the previous row, you make a turning chain with 
2 chains rather than 3, and your final stitch is a half double crochet (hdc).
 
3. Yarn over (yo) and insert your hook from front to back between the 
posts of the first and second double crochet of the row below and 
then from back to front again between the posts of the second and 
third stitches (see Figure 11-5a).
 
 The hook should now be positioned horizontally behind the double 
crochet that you’re working around, as shown in Figure 11-5b.

4. Yarn over and draw the yarn around the post of the stitch.
 
 You should now have 3 loops on your hook.
 
5. Yarn over and draw the yarn through the first 2 loops closest to the 
hook end twice, like in Figure 11-6a.
 
 One front post double crochet is now complete. Refer to Figure 11-6b 
for the completed stitch and Figure 11-6c for the stitch’s symbol.

Back post stitches
Back post stitches appear to recede on the side of the fabric facing you, 
creating a ridge. To form a back post double crochet (abbreviated BPdc), 
follow these steps:
 
1. Work a row of normal double crochet (dc) for the first row and turn.
 
2. Chain 2 (ch 2) for the first double crochet.
 
 Because a post stitch is shorter than a normal stitch, you make the 
turning chain with 1 chain stitch less than the turning chain normally 
requires. (Flip to Chapter 5 for the basics of turning chains.)
 
3. Yarn over (yo) and insert your hook from back to front between the 
posts of the first and second double crochets in the row below and 
then from front to back again between the posts of the second and 
third stitches (see Figure 11-7a).
 
 Your hook should now be positioned horizontally in front of the double 
crochet that you’re working around, as in Figure 11-7b.
 
4. Yarn over and draw the yarn around the post of the stitch.
 
 You now have 3 loops on your hook.

 Chapter 11: Creating Texture in Unexpected Ways
Solidifying fabric with linked stitches
If you work a swatch of almost any basic stitch, you’ll notice that by working 
each stitch independently of each other, the fabric results in gaps, or spaces, 
between stitches. You can create a more solid fabric with linked stitches, 
stitches that you link to one another as you work.
Linked stitches are worked with taller stitches such as double and triple cro-
chet (see Chapter 6), where yarn overs are replaced by inserting the hook 
into the post of the previous stitch and drawing up a loop. In the sections 
that follow, we describe how to make rows of specific linked stitches called 
linked triple crochets (abbreviated Ltr).
Making your first row of linked stitches
To create your first linked triple crochet:
 
1. Chain any number of chains (ch) plus 4 at the end.
 
 The 4 stitches at the end create the triple crochet turning chain.
 
2. Insert your hook into the second chain away from the hook, yarn over 
(yo), and draw up a loop.
 
 There are 2 loops on the hook (see Figure 11-9a).
 
3. Insert your hook into the third chain away from the hook, yarn over, 
and draw up a loop.
 
 Now you have 3 loops on the hook (refer to Figure 11-9b).
 
4. Insert your hook into the fifth chain away from the hook, yarn over, 
and draw up a loop.
 
 The reason you skip the fourth chain is so that the first linked triple 
stitch looks just like the other stitches in the row. There are 4 loops on 
the hook (see Figure 11-9c).
 
5. Yarn over and draw through the first 2 loops on your hook.
 
 Now you have 3 loops on the hook (see Figure 11-10a).
 
6. Yarn over and draw through the first 2 loops on your hook.
 
 You’re left with 2 loops on the hook (see Figure 11-10b).
 
7. Yarn over and draw through the last 2 loops on your hook.
 
 Nice work! You’ve just finished 1 linked triple crochet (see how yours 
matches up with Figure 11-10c). Want to know the symbol for this par-
ticular stitch? Check out Figure 11-10d.

 Chapter 11: Creating Texture in Unexpected Ways
To create the second linked triple crochet in the first row:
 
1. Insert your hook into the upper horizontal bar found at the side 
of the last linked triple crochet (ltr) you made, yarn over (yo), and 
draw up a loop.
 
 There are 2 loops on the hook (see Figure 11-11a).
 
2. Insert your hook into the lower bar found at the side of the last linked 
triple crochet you made, yarn over, and draw up a loop.
 
 Now you have 3 loops on the hook (refer to Figure 11-11b).
 
3. Insert your hook into the next chain of the foundation chain, yarn 
over, and draw up a loop.
 
 There are 4 loops on the hook (see Figure 11-11c).
 
4. Yarn over and draw through the first 2 loops on your hook, 3 times.
 
 You’re left with 1 loop on the hook (see Figure 11-11d).
Repeat the preceding four steps for each linked triple crochet across to the 
end of the row.

Part III: Advanced Stitches and Techniques 
Creating your second row of linked stitches
After you’ve made your first row of linked stitches, follow these steps to tran-
sition to the first linked stitch of the second row (and all subsequent rows):
 
1. Chain 4 (ch 4) for the turning chain.
 
2. Insert your hook into the second chain away from the hook, yarn over 
(yo), and draw up a loop.
 
 You now have 2 loops on your hook.
 
3. Insert your hook into the third chain away from the hook, yarn over, 
and draw up a loop.
 
 A total of 3 loops are now on your hook.
 
4. Insert your hook into the top 2 loops of the next stitch, yarn over, and 
draw up a loop (refer to Figure 11-12a).
 
 You now have 4 loops on your hook.
 
5. Yarn over and draw through the first 2 loops on your hook, 3 times.
 
 Figure 11-12b shows the first linked triple crochet (ltr) in the second row.
To complete additional linked stitches in your second row and all additional 
rows, just follow the guidelines for adding more stitches to a row (which we 
describe in the preceding section).

Spiking into previous rows
Long stitches (also known as spikes) are usually single crochet stitches that 
you work into either the tops of stitches or the spaces between stitches one 
or more rows below the current row to create a vertical spike of yarn that 
extends over several rows of stitches.

199
 Chapter 11: Creating Texture in Unexpected Ways
 
Long stitches produce a spike on both sides of the fabric, so they’re well 
suited for a design that’s reversible, such as an afghan. They’re also particu-
larly striking in a contrasting color.
To create a long single crochet stitch:
 
1. Insert your hook from front to back under the top 2 loops of the des-
ignated stitch 1 or more rows below the row you’re currently working 
in, as shown in Figure 11-13.
 
Figure 11-13:

rows below 
the current

2. Draw the yarn through the stitch and up to the current level of work.
 
 You should now have 2 loops on your hook.
 
3. Yarn over (yo) and draw the yarn through the 2 loops on your hook.
 
 Figure 11-14a shows you a complete long single crochet stitch (although 
the length varies depending on where you stick your hook, of course).

Part III: Advanced Stitches and Techniques 
 
To make other types of long stitches, such as a long double crochet, you 
follow the same steps as for the long single crochet. Just remember to yarn 
over first as necessary and then make the stitch the same way you always do. 
The only variation is that you’re sticking the hook in a different spot.
When Shrinking Is A-Okay: Felting 
Your Crocheted Projects
Have you ever tossed your favorite wool sweater into the washing machine 
and found that it came out a lot smaller than when it went in? Your sweater 
went through a process known as felting. Felting is a method used to shrink 
a piece of fabric that has been crocheted, knit, or woven by using a combina-
tion of hot, soapy water and agitation. The hot, soapy water opens the scales 
found along the yarn fibers, and the agitation, caused by a washing machine 
or by rubbing the fabric together by hand, causes the scales to tangle and 
lock. As the fibers interlock, your project gets smaller and creates a solid, 
sturdy fabric. The longer you wash your project, the denser it becomes.
Although shrinking crocheted garments may once have been considered an 
accident, felting is a great way to create a sturdy, dense fabric that’s perfect 
for bags, rugs, garments, and accessories. You can felt your projects by 
machine or by hand, as you find out in the following sections, but the process 
usually goes quicker in the washing machine. Felting by hand works best for 
smaller items and edges that have been cut.
 
You can only felt yarns that are made of animal fibers, such as sheep, alpaca, 
rabbit, or goat. Wool yarns that say superwash don’t felt because they’ve been 
treated to create a machine-washable fiber. Look for yarns that say hand wash 
in cold water only.
For both felting methods, you need
 
✓ A washing machine or wash bucket filled with hot water
 
✓ Baking soda or laundry soap
 
✓ A towel
 
If you don’t want to wait for your project to air-dry, you can place it in the dryer, 
but keep in mind that it may shrink a little more. After your felted project is dry, 
you can embellish it in ways you may not be able to with regular crocheted 
fabric. Felted fabric is just like felt; you can embroider, bead, dye, paint, and even 
cut it. Check out Chapter 18 for fun ideas for embellishing crocheted pieces.

201
 Chapter 11: Creating Texture in Unexpected Ways
Felting by machine
Here’s your step-by-step guide to felting a project by machine:
 
1. Set your washing machine for the smallest load on hot water/cold 
rinse and toss in 3 to 4 tablespoons of baking soda or laundry soap.
 
 The water should be very hot. If you find the shrinking process is going 
too slowly, add a pot of boiling water to turn the heat up.
 
2. Place your project into a secured bag (like a zippered laundry bag or 
pillowcase) and drop it into the machine.
 
 Adding a pair of jeans or tennis shoes at this point may speed up the 
felting process. Their presence in the washing machine increases the 
agitation on the wool fibers in order to bind them together.
 
3. Start the wash cycle and continue resetting it until your project 
reaches the desired size.
 
 Your project will take a few wash cycles to shrink to the desired size, 
and you want to keep the water hot. When your project has reached its 
desired size, let the machine move into the rinse cycle to get rid of the 
soap and most of the excess water. (Check the machine often to keep it 
from going into the rinse cycle before you’re ready.)
 
4. Take your project out of the bag, roll it in a towel to remove any 
remaining water, and then shape it by pulling it to the desired size 
and smoothing out any warps or wrinkles.
 
 Insert a form, if necessary, to help the piece keep its shape and then 
allow it to dry. (See Chapter 19 for more on blocking three-dimensional 
projects with forms.)
Felting by hand
To felt your project by hand, follow these steps:
 
1. Put 3 to 4 tablespoons of baking soda or laundry soap in a wash 
bucket and fill the bucket with hot water.
 
 If the water is too hot to touch, use heavy-duty cleaning gloves to protect 
your hands.
 
2. Submerge your crochet project completely, allowing it to become 
thoroughly wet.
 
3. Using both hands, vigorously rub the fabric together, rotating it regu-
larly in order to felt the project evenly, until it has been felted to the 
desired size.

202
Part III: Advanced Stitches and Techniques 
 
 To increase the agitation, you can also scrub the project against a 
washboard or bamboo sushi mat. Be sure to add more hot water and 
soap as needed.
 
4. Rinse out the soap, roll the project in a towel to remove any remaining 
water, and then shape it by pulling it to the desired size and smooth-
ing out any warps or wrinkles.
 
 If necessary, insert a form into the project to help it keep its shape. Then 
give it some time to dry.
Textured Scarf Project
The textured fabric in this scarf comes from alternating between working 
stitches in the back top loop and the front top loop. Worked in single crochet 
with a slightly larger hook than you normally use for a worsted-weight yarn, 
the back loop/front loop pattern creates a nubby effect, and the fringe at each 
end finishes the design off nicely. The scarf (which you can see in the color 
section) is a perfect accessory for a cool fall afternoon, and you can find the 
recommended yarn (which by the way is pretty reasonably priced) in a wide 
variety of colors to match your wardrobe. If you do change your yarn, be sure 
to check your gauge; Chapter 3 explains how gauge affects your projects.

With RS facing and CC, insert hook in the space at the end of the first row of 1 
of the straps. Ch 2, working across the long edge of the strap, * work 2 hdc in 
the next row-end, 1 hdc in the next row-end *; rep from * to * across to oppo-

Turn the bag inside out. Using the yarn needle and yarn, whipstitch the 
bottom opening together so the straps are positioned at the center of each 
side of the bag (see Chapter 15 for more on sewing pieces together).
Take 1 point at the end of the bottom seam and fold it in 2 in. so the point 
lines up with the seam. Whipstitch the point down with a few stitches. Rep 
for the point at the opposite end of the bottom seam. By folding these corner 
points inward, you create a box bottom for the bag (see Figure 11-18).

T
unisian crochet is a special kind of stitch that you can use to make any-
thing from home décor items, such as afghans, place mats, and rugs, 
to sweaters, coats, and accessories. This type of crochet is different from 
standard crochet stitches in that each row is worked in two separate halves: 
The first half adds the loops to your hook, and the second half takes them 
off. Tunisian crochet produces a rather solid fabric that closely resembles 
knitted fabric, although it uses much more yarn and therefore produces a 
heavier fabric than knitting does. (When making clothing using Tunisian cro-
chet, use a lighter-weight yarn, such as a sport weight. Worsted-weight yarn 
is more suitable for afghans, and rugs work up beautifully using bulky-weight 
yarn.) The stitches themselves are squarish, which makes the fabric perfect 
for working multicolored designs or as a base for cross-stitch designs.
Tunisian crochet stitches have many variations that look quite different from 
each other, but in this chapter we tell you how to work three of the most 
common ones: the basic Tunisian stitch and the knit and purl variations. We 
also show you what special hooks you need, how to increase and decrease 
stitches, and how to work from a chart for designs with color changes as well 
as for cross-stitch designs. After you master the Tunisian crochet technique, 
try out the Absorbent Hand Towel project at the end of this chapter.
Note: Tunisian crochet has many names attached to it. So if you come across any 
of the following names, know that they’re referring to Tunisian crochet: afghan 
stitch, tricot crochet, shepherd’s knitting, hook knitting, and railroad knitting.

210
Part III: Advanced Stitches and Techniques 
Taking a Look at Tunisian Crochet Tools
Tunisian crochet is a unique form of crochet that calls for a unique hook. 
Unlike standard crochet, where you work each stitch off to one loop before 
going on to the next stitch, Tunisian crochet requires you to pick up a whole 
row of stitches on the hook before you work off the loops on a second pass. 
To accommodate all of these stitches, you need a hook with a cap or a stop-
per on the end to hold the stitches. Standard Tunisian hooks are long and 
straight with a cap, but you can also find hooks with longer cable attach-
ments and even double-ended hooks that give you more flexibility when 
working wider projects.
Tunisian hooks are longer than standard hooks, too, coming in a variety of 
lengths and sizes; the most popular Tunisian hooks are 10 to 14 inches long 
and range in size from size G to size K. The longest hooks, like those with 
cable-cord attachments, are ideal for making large afghans. You can see a 
sampling of Tunisian crochet hooks in Figure 12-1.
 
Longer hooks can be cumbersome if you don’t need the extra length. The 
best way to determine what hook length suits your purpose is to refer to the 
beginning of your pattern’s instructions. If the materials list doesn’t mention a 
specific length, take a look at the measurements of the pieces you’ll be work-
ing and use a hook that fits the size of each piece. For example, if each piece 
is 13 inches wide, use a 14-inch hook. If you work an afghan in one piece that 
measures 40 inches wide, then the 22-inch flexible hook or the 40-inch double-
ended hook is appropriate.

211
 Chapter 12: Like Knitting with a Hook: Tunisian Crochet
 
When you want to crochet small pieces in Tunisian crochet (or when you just 
want to try out the technique), you can actually use a standard crochet hook 
rather than a Tunisian crochet hook. Simply wrap a rubber band several times 
around the base of the standard hook to keep the stitches from falling off the 
end. If you want to try Tunisian crochet with finer yarn or cotton thread, use a 
smaller crochet hook.
Creating the Tunisian Simple Stitch
If a pattern calls for Tunisian crochet, it’s usually referring to the Tunisian 
simple stitch, abbreviated Tss. Tunisian simple stitches are shaped like little 
squares with two horizontal strands of yarn and a vertical bar on top of them. 
(You can see a sample in Figure 12-2.)
 
Each row of Tunisian simple stitch is worked in two halves:
 
✓ Forward (first) half: Picking up the loops. (The forward half is some-
times called the forward pass or forward row.)
 
✓ Return (second) half: Working off the loops, without turning your work 
between rows. (The return half is sometimes called the return pass or 
return row.)
 
Figure 12-2: 
A swatch 
of Tunisian 
simple 
stitch.
 
As you discover in the next sections, you start out with a foundation row that 
you work the same way for all variations of Tunisian crochet. The forward 
half of the second row, and beyond, establishes the pattern — in this case 

212
Part III: Advanced Stitches and Techniques 
the Tunisian simple stitch. (Check out the section “Varying Your Tunisian 
Crochet” for instructions on the knit stitch and purl stitch variations.) You 
usually work the return half of each row (from the second row on) in the 
same way for all variations of Tunisian crochet.
 
To practice working the Tunisian simple stitch, use a worsted-weight yarn and 
a 10-inch size H-8 U.S. (5 mm) Tunisian crochet hook.
Starting with a foundation row
Because Tunisian stitches require you to pull loops up through existing 
stitches, you need to start with a foundation row, which is actually the first 
row of the design. Chain 16 stitches for your foundation chain, and you’re 
ready to begin the forward half of your foundation row of Tunisian crochet.
Working the forward half of your foundation row
Follow these steps to work the forward half of the foundation row, drawing 
up the loops of each stitch onto your hook:
 
1. Insert your hook into the second chain stitch (ch) from the hook.
 
 See Chapter 5 for more on counting chain stitches.
 
2. Yarn over the hook (yo).
 
3. Draw your yarn through the chain stitch, as shown in Figure 12-3a.
 
 You should have 2 loops on your hook.
 
Figure 12-3: 
Working the 
forward 
half of the 
foundation 
row.
 a
b
 
4. Insert your hook into the next chain stitch and repeat Steps 2 and 3 
in each chain stitch across the foundation chain until your hook is 
loaded with loops (like in Figure 12-3b).
 
 This technique is known as drawing up the loops. If you have 16 loops on 
your hook — 1 for each chain stitch in your foundation chain — then the 
forward half of your foundation row of Tunisian crochet is complete.

213
 Chapter 12: Like Knitting with a Hook: Tunisian Crochet
Working the return half of your foundation row
To work the return half of the foundation row, work the loops off the hook by 
doing the following:
 
1. Yarn over the hook (yo).
 
2. Draw your yarn through the first loop on the hook, as shown in 
Figure 12-4a.
 
3. Yarn over the hook.
 
4. Draw your yarn through the next 2 loops on the hook (see Figure 12-4b).
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 across the row until 1 loop remains on the hook.
 
 You’ve just successfully worked Tunisian crochet across your founda-
tion row. Well done! One loop remains on your hook (see Figure 12-5), 
and it counts as the first stitch of the next row.

the loops on 
the return 
half.

b
 
Figure 12-5: 
A completed

Continuing to the second row and beyond
You place your hook differently for the stitches in the second row of Tunisian 
crochet, but otherwise, you work them across the row in the same manner as 
for the foundation row. You then work each successive row the same way as 
the second row.

214
Part III: Advanced Stitches and Techniques 
Working the forward half of the second row
To begin the forward half of your next row of Tunisian simple stitch:
 
1. Insert your hook behind the next vertical bar in the row below.
 
 Don’t work into the vertical bar directly below the loop on your hook; if 
you do, you’ll end up adding a stitch to the row.
 
2. Yarn over the hook (yo).
 
3. Draw the yarn through the stitch, as shown in Figure 12-6a.
 
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 in each vertical bar across the row until you 
reach the next-to-last stitch.
 
5. Insert your hook under the last 2 vertical bars at the end of the row 
(refer to Figure 12-6b).
 
6. Yarn over the hook.
 
7. Draw your yarn through both vertical bars.
 
 You should now have 16 loops on your hook. If you do, then the forward 
half of this row is complete.
 
Figure 12-6: 
Working the 
forward

second row.
 a
b
Working the return half of the second row
To work the return half of the second row, repeat Steps 1 through 5 from the 
earlier section “Working the return half of your foundation row.” Continue 
working rows of Tunisian simple stitch until you feel comfortable with this 
technique (a good length for a practice swatch is 4 inches).
Binding off
When you finish your last row of Tunisian simple stitch, you can’t just fasten 
off your yarn like you do with other standard crochet stitches. Instead, you 
need to bind off the top edge of your last row of Tunisian crochet with a row 
of slip stitches. If you don’t bind off the last row, the stitches will have gaps 

215
 Chapter 12: Like Knitting with a Hook: Tunisian Crochet
in them and won’t look like the rest of the piece. So, using the same hook, 
work a slip stitch under each vertical bar across the last row. (See Chapter 5 
for instructions on making slip stitches.)
 
The different variations of Tunisian crochet may call for a different binding-off 
stitch (like a row of single crochet, for example). The specific pattern you’re 
following indicates what stitch to use when binding off, so make sure you 
check for this info before you automatically start binding off with slip stitches.
Shaping the Tunisian Simple Stitch
When working in Tunisian crochet, you may occasionally need to shape 
your work, particularly when you’re making sweaters. The great thing about 
Tunisian crochet stitches is that you increase and decrease in the same way 
whether you do it at the beginning, middle, or end of a row. And the same 
general technique applies to all variations of Tunisian crochet — you do all of 
your increasing and decreasing on the forward half of a row. In the following 
sections, we explain how to increase and decrease in Tunisian simple stitch.
Increasing in Tunisian simple stitch
 
You always make increases in the forward half of a row of Tunisian simple 
stitch, creating the extra loops on your hook; then you work off all the loops in 
the return half, as usual.
To practice making increases, grab the swatch you made in the earlier 
“Creating the Tunisian Simple Stitch” section or head there to make one. To 
increase by one stitch, work the forward half of the row as follows:
 
1. With 1 loop on your hook from the previous row, insert your hook 
into the space between the first and second stitch (not under the verti-
cal bar). (Refer to Figure 12-7a.)
 
2. Yarn over (yo).
 
3. Draw the yarn through the stitch.
 
 One increase at the beginning of the row is now complete.
 
4. Work in Tunisian simple stitch (Tss) across the rest of the row, starting 
in the next vertical bar.
 
 You should have 17 loops on your hook because you added 1. (The extra 
loop is highlighted in Figure 12-7b.)

Increasing 
at the begin-
ning of the 
forward half 
of a row.
 a
b
Working the return half of a row is pretty standard, whether you’re working 
the foundation row or Row 12 of Tunisian crochet. To work the return half 
of the increase row, repeat Steps 1 through 5 from the earlier “Working the 
return half of your foundation row” section.
Decreasing in Tunisian simple stitch
 
Making a decrease in the Tunisian simple stitch is pretty similar to making an 
increase: You decrease in the forward half of a row of Tunisian simple stitch, 
subtracting loops from your hook; then you work off all the loops in the return 
half, just like you always do.
To practice making decreases, use the swatch you just made the increase on 
(if you’re following this chapter in order), or head to the earlier “Creating the 
Tunisian Simple Stitch” section to make a swatch. To decrease one stitch, 
work the forward half of the row as follows:
 
1. With 1 loop on your hook from the previous row, insert your hook 
behind the second and third vertical bars in the row below. (See 
Figure 12-8a.)
 
2. Yarn over (yo).
 
3. Draw the yarn through both stitches.
 
 One decrease at the beginning of the row is now complete.
 
4. Work in Tunisian simple stitch (Tss) across the rest of the row.
 
 You should have 15 loops on your hook because you decreased by 1 
stitch. (Refer to Figure 12-8b.)

To work the return half of the decrease row, repeat Steps 1 through 5 of the 
“Working the return half of your foundation row” section, found earlier in 
this chapter.
Varying Your Tunisian Crochet
Two of the most common variations of the Tunisian simple stitch are the 
Tunisian knit stitch and the Tunisian purl stitch, which, not surprisingly, 
resemble the knitting stitches they’re named after — knit and purl. The cro-
cheted fabric is thicker than the knitted, however, and you can see a notice-
able ridge on the back of it.
 
When working any variation of Tunisian crochet, begin the pattern on the 
second row of your piece, after the foundation row of Tunisian simple stitch 
(which you always work the same way).
Tunisian knit stitch
Tunisian knit stitch, abbreviated Tks, is also known as stockinette stitch. It looks 
like rows of Vs nesting in the row below (see for yourself in Figure 12-9). You 
can use the Tunisian knit stitch for afghans, as well as for home décor and 
fashion items. Like working with any kind of Tunisian crochet, you begin with 
a foundation row made up of Tunisian simple stitch. For the purposes of this 
exercise, work a foundation row of 16 stitches. (Refer to the section “Starting 
with a foundation row,” earlier in this chapter, to find out how.)

218

Figure 12-9:

To begin the forward half of the first row of Tunisian knit stitch:
 
1. Insert your hook, from front to back, between the front and back 
strands of the next vertical stitch.
 
2. Yarn over (yo).
 
3. Draw the yarn through the stitch, as in Figure 12-10a.

4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 across the row until you reach the next-to-
last stitch.
 
5. Insert your hook under the last 2 vertical bars at the end of the row, 
like in Figure 12-10b.
 
6. Yarn over.
 
7. Draw the yarn through the stitch.
 
 You should now have 16 loops on your hook.
To work the return half of the first row, repeat Steps 1 through 5 of the earlier 
“Working the return half of your foundation row” section across the row. The 

219
 Chapter 12: Like Knitting with a Hook: Tunisian Crochet
first row of Tunisian knit stitch is now complete; yours should look like the 
example in Figure 12-11.
 
Figure 12-11: 
A completed 
first row 
of Tunisian 
knit stitch.
 
For each additional row of Tunisian knit stitch, repeat the preceding steps. 
Work this stitch until you feel comfortable with it.
Tunisian purl stitch
Tunisian purl stitch, abbreviated Tps, is also known as purl stitch and looks like 
rows of rounded bumps (see Figure 12-12). Tunisian purl stitch is useful by 
itself or in combination with other Tunisian stitches to produce textured pat-
terns. Like working any other type of Tunisian crochet, you need to build from 
a foundation row. To get started, work a 16-stitch foundation row (follow the 
instructions in the earlier “Starting with a foundation row” section).
 
Figure 12-12: 
A swatch 
of Tunisian 
purl stitch.
 
 
People tend to tighten up their stitches when working in Tunisian purl stitch. 
Be very conscious of tension and be sure to double-check your gauge when 
working this stitch. If you feel that you can’t loosen up with the hook that a 

220
Part III: Advanced Stitches and Techniques 
pattern suggests, change to a larger hook in order to get the desired gauge. 
(For more on gauge, refer to Chapter 3.)
Here’s how to begin the forward half of your first row of Tunisian purl stitch:
 
1. With the index finger of your yarn hand, bring the working yarn to 
the front of your work and insert your hook under the vertical bar of 
the next stitch (but behind the strand of working yarn).
 
 Figure 12-13a shows this action, as well as how to work Steps 2 and 3 
that follow.

2. Yarn over (yo).
 
3. Draw the yarn through the stitch.
 
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 across the row until you reach the next-to-
last stitch.
 
5. Insert your hook under the last 2 vertical bars at the end of the row, 
as shown in Figure 12-13b.
 
6. Yarn over.
 
7. Draw the yarn through the stitch.
 
 You should have 16 loops on your hook.
To work the return half of the row, repeat Steps 1 through 5 of the “Working 
the return half of your foundation row” section, found earlier in this chapter. 
For each additional row of Tunisian purl stitch, repeat the preceding steps; 
keep practicing until you feel comfortable performing this technique. Figure 
12-14 shows a finished row of Tunisian purl stitch for your reference.

 Chapter 12: Like Knitting with a Hook: Tunisian Crochet
Coloring Your Tunisian Crochet
Because Tunisian crochet produces a gridlike stitch pattern, it’s an excellent 
medium for creating colored designs. You can work color into the design 
while you’re crocheting, or you can cross-stitch a colored design onto the 
surface after you’ve finished crocheting. Either of these techniques works 
great for afghans, wall hangings, rugs, place mats, potholders, and even 
sweaters. The sections that follow delve into the ins and outs of adding color 
to your Tunisian crochet pieces.
Crocheting with more than one color
Most patterns that call for color changes in Tunisian crochet provide a chart 
to show where you switch colors. If you’re going to use a color again in the 
same row with no more than three stitches in between, you can carry the 
color loosely on the wrong side of the work and pick it up later, as Chapter 9 
Addressing the curling problem
Fabric made of Tunisian crochet tends to curl 
up along the bottom edge. This is normal and 
happens because more yarn is on the back 
of the work than on the front. If you’re having 
problems with curling, try working your Tunisian 
crochet in one of the following ways:
 ✓ Work the foundation row in just the top 
loop (the one at the top when the right 
side is facing you) of the foundation chain. 
(Refer to Chapter 5 for more on foundation 
chains.)
 ✓ Work the foundation row in the top 2 loops 
(the part of each chain stitch that forms a V) 
of the foundation chain.
 ✓ Work the foundation row in the back loop 
of the foundation chain. To do so, turn your 
foundation chain over. Notice one little 
raised-up loop on the backside of each 
stitch? Work your foundation row in these 
loops.
 ✓ After working the foundation row, purl the 
first row or two. Because Tunisian purl stitch 
tends to have just as much yarn on the front 
of the work as it does on the back, it doesn’t 
curl much. Working a few rows of Tunisian 
purl stitch before beginning the pattern may 
solve your curling problem. (See the section 
“Tunisian purl stitch,” earlier in this chapter, 
for more on this particular stitch.)
If your work still curls after trying these meth-
ods, don’t despair. You can remedy the curling 
problem by
 ✓ Blocking your design while working on it or 
after you finish it. (See Chapter 19 for block-
ing directions.)
 ✓ Placing a heavy object (such as a large 
book) on the edge of your work for a few 
days to flatten it out.
 ✓ Working a border around the design, espe-
cially a heavy border with lots of stitches.

222
Part III: Advanced Stitches and Techniques 
shows you how to do. However, be aware that the carried strand is visible on 
the back of your work. If you have more than three stitches in between, we 
suggest you fasten off and rejoin the yarn when you need it.
 
When working with several different colors and different balls of yarn, alleviate 
the inevitable tangle on the back of your work by joining small balls of yarn 
rather than whole skeins of each color. If you’re going to work just a few stitches 
of a certain color, estimate the amount of yarn that you need for a patch of 
color by counting the number of stitches in the patch and allowing 2 inches 
for each stitch plus 4 more inches at each end. Wind the allotted amount of 
yarn into a small ball or wrap it around a yarn bobbin (Chapter 2 fills you in on 
this cool crocheting tool).
Figure 12-15 shows you an example of a color chart, a chart key, and the end 
product. To use the color chart, read all the rows from right to left when 
working the forward half of the rows. After you work the return half of the 
row, you’re back at the right side to begin the next row. Each square counts 
as one complete stitch.

Note that the following steps for using a color chart for Tunisian simple stitch 
changes are general and don’t correspond with the chart in Figure 12-15:
 
1. Draw up the designated number of loops of the first color according to 
the squares on the chart.
 
 The first loop on the hook counts as the first stitch of the row.
 
2. When you need to switch to a new color, drop the first color to the 
wrong side so you can pick it up in the return half of the row.
 
3. With the new color behind your work, insert your hook into the next 
stitch, yarn over (yo) with the new color, and draw that yarn through 
the stitch.

223

4. Continue by drawing up the designated number of loops of the 
new color.
 
 Figure 12-16 shows 4 loops of the old color and 1 loop of the new color 
being drawn up.

6. For the return half of the row, work off the loops with the matching 
color until 1 loop of the current color remains on the hook.
 
7. Pick up the next color in sequence from the wrong side of the work, 
drawing it under the working end of the first color (thereby twisting 
the yarn to prevent holes in the work), and yarn over.
 
8. Draw the new color through 1 loop of the previous color and 1 loop of 
the matching color, as shown in Figure 12-17.

9. Repeat Steps 6 through 8 as needed across the row until 1 loop 
remains on the hook.
 
 One row of the chart is now complete. Each time you finish changing 
colors, continue working off the loops as you normally would. Then 
repeat Steps 6 through 8 as necessary to change colors.
 
10. Repeat Steps 1 through 9 for each row of the chart.
Cross-stitching on top of Tunisian crochet
Tunisian crochet, especially Tunisian simple stitch, makes an ideal base for 
working cross-stitch designs and is often used for just that. You can produce 
a more delicate color pattern, as well as a more elaborate one, when cross-
stitching on Tunisian crochet fabric rather than working color changes within 
the crochet. Plus you don’t have to deal with changing colors in the middle of 
a row while crocheting. In the sections that follow, we provide a few pointers 
on cross-stitching on top of Tunisian crochet and explain how to make a com-
plete cross-stitch row.
A few handy tips before you begin
You work cross-stitch designs by following a chart (see Figure 12-18) so you 
can see where to place the stitches. Each square on the chart represents 
one stitch in Tunisian crochet and one cross-stitch. If you’re working a small 
design on a large piece of crocheted fabric, the instructions tell you where to 
position the design on your piece. A chart key accompanies the chart, indi-
cating what color the symbols on the chart stand for.
 
Figure 12-18:

Cross-stitch in one color at a time, following the chart from left to right in

work the first half of each stitch across the row and then come back from 
right to left to work the second half of each stitch.

225
 Chapter 12: Like Knitting with a Hook: Tunisian Crochet
 
Standard cross-stitch technique, where the needle goes through the fabric to 
the back and then up through the fabric to the front, produces a rather sloppy 
back on your item. To avoid the yarn showing on the back, be careful to slide 
your needle under the two horizontal strands of the Tunisian stitch near the 
surface of your work. Check the back of your work frequently to make sure 
nothing is showing.
 
If you make your cross-stitches too tight, you can ruin your design. The cross-
stitches should lay over the Tunisian crochet without causing the background 
to pucker.
The first part of a cross-stitch row
To work cross-stitch on Tunisian simple stitch, follow these steps (which ref-
erence Figure 12-19) to make the first half of a row:
 
1. Thread a length of the designated color yarn onto a yarn needle.
 
 Use a length of yarn that’s comfortable to work with. An 18-inch length is 
about average.
 
2. Insert the needle from back to front at Position A (the bottom left-
hand corner of the designated stitch) and draw the needle up, leaving 
a 4-inch length of yarn on the back (which you’ll later weave in).
 
3. Insert the needle at Position B (the top right-hand corner of the same 
stitch), angled vertically down, behind the 2 horizontal threads.

5. Position C now becomes Position A of the next stitch.
 
6. Repeat Steps 3 through 5 across the row in the stitches where the 
chart calls for cross-stitching.
The second part of a cross-stitch row
To make the second half of a cross-stitch row, follow these steps (which refer 
to Figure 12-20):
 
1. Insert your needle at Position D (the top left-hand corner of the same 
stitch you ended the first half with), angled vertically down, behind 
the 2 horizontal threads.
 
 The thread should form an X with the already-completed first half of the 
stitch.
 
2. Bring the needle out at Position E (the bottom left-hand corner of the 
same stitch) and draw the yarn through until it stretches neatly across 
the stitch.
 
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 across the row, completing each cross-stitch.

When you’re finished working cross-stitches with a particular color, weave 
the ends through the Tunisian background for several inches to hide the 
strands. Then clip off the excess yarn (see Chapter 5 for more information on 
weaving in ends). Figure 12-21 shows a finished cross-stitch design.

Always work cross-stitches with the thread crossing on top in the same direc-
tion. And don’t tie knots in the yarn at the beginning or the end of your work. 
Simply weave in the ends to secure them and snip off the excess.
Absorbent Hand Towel Project
This project uses Tunisian simple stitch and Tunisian purl stitch to make a 
thick and thirsty hand towel. The yarn is made of absorbent cotton and comes 
in a nice selection of colors so you can put together colors that complement 
your bathroom or kitchen. The project is finished with simple cross-stitches 
on bands of Tunisian simple stitch to add classic contrast and design.
Materials and vital statistics
 
✓ Yarn: Elmore-Pisgah “Peaches & Crème” 4-ply worsted-weight yarn 
(100% cotton), Article #930 (2.5 oz. [70.8 g], 122 yds [112 m] each ball): 2 
balls of #1 White (MC) and 1 ball of #10 Yellow (CC)
 
✓ Hooks:

obtain gauge
 
• Standard crochet hook size J-9 U.S. (6 mm) or size needed to 
obtain gauge
 
✓ Large-eyed yarn needle
 
✓ Measurements: 27 in. long x 17 in. wide

228
Part III: Advanced Stitches and Techniques 
 
✓ Gauge: 14 sts and 12 rows = 4 in. in alternating Tunisian simple stitch 
(Tss) and Tunisian purl stitch (Tps) pattern
 
✓ Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), Tunisian simple stitch (Tss), Tunisian 
purl stitch (Tps), single crochet (sc), slip stitch (sl st)
Directions
The Absorbent Hand Towel is worked lengthwise in five sections using two 
different stitch patterns. The first, third, and fifth sections are created by 
alternating one stitch of Tunisian simple stitch with one stitch of Tunisian 
purl stitch to create a honeycomb pattern. The second and fourth sections 
are worked in plain Tunisian simple stitch, which creates the background for 
cross-stitching embellishment at the end. Follow the chart in Figure 12-22.

N
ot to be confused with filet mignon or filet of sole, filet crochet (also 
known as net stitch) is a technique that imitates a 17th-century form of 
lace worked on mesh netting stretched across a frame. Over the years, the 
technique evolved into what it is today — a series of blocks and spaces that 
form a design. Because of the uniformity of the designs, the directions are 
shown in a chart, with each square of the chart representing specific stitches.
Mesh patterns, which are related to filet crochet, use a combination of chain 
stitches and basic stitches, like single crochet and double crochet, to create 
light, open, lacy projects. Quick to work up and simple to master, mesh pat-
terns can be used on their own or to form the background for embellishment. 
With simple changes to stitch height, number of chains, and placement of 
stitches, creating many new mesh stitch patterns is easy.
This chapter gives you the lowdown on both filet and mesh crochet. You 
find out how to create filet crochet using blocks and spaces, how to read 
filet crochet charts, and how to shape your filet crochet designs, as well as 
a few variations of basic mesh patterns. Even better than that? At the end of 
this chapter, you can practice your skills with a butterfly table runner and an 
environmentally friendly mesh market bag.

Filet Crochet for Newbies
You’ve probably seen filet crochet many times, but you may not have known 
it. Its distinct meshlike designs, usually worked in white cotton thread, are 
often used for tablecloths, table runners, curtains, and wall hangings; they’re 
especially elegant against a dark wood surface or brightly colored cloth back-
ground. Filet crochet is much simpler than it looks, so it’s great for beginners. 
In the sections that follow, we introduce you to the basics of making filet cro-
chet; one project at the end of this chapter, the Butterfly Runner that you can 
see in the color section, is a typical example of the filet crochet technique.
Breaking down filet crochet stitches
Perhaps you’ve seen a drawing or painting made of small dots or squares. 
Looking at the drawing from a distance, you see only the design or picture, 
but as you come closer, you can see the tiny dots/squares that make up the 
larger picture. Similar to the tiny dots/squares in the drawing, filet crochet is 
a grid of blocks and spaces that make up a design. The spaces form the back-
ground, and the blocks create the design. Patterns for these designs are given 
as charts (see the next section). Because of its detail, filet crochet is commonly 
used for lettering. (Here’s an interesting tidbit for you: The earliest-known text 
depicted with filet crochet is The Lord’s Prayer.)
 
Each space and block is made up of three stitches:
 
✓ Spaces begin with two chain stitches, followed by a double crochet stitch.
 
✓ Blocks are made up of three double crochet stitches, which you can 
work in the stitches or spaces of the previous row.
 
To make sure your design is clear, work filet crochet patterns with cotton 
thread. Start with size 10 thread and a size 7 steel (1.50 mm) hook. After you 
have some experience with this technique, move on to a smaller size 20 or size 
30 thread and a size 12 (0.75 mm) or 14 (0.60 mm) steel hook to create a much 
more delicate and elegant design. (Flip to Chapter 2 for the basics on different 
types of threads and hooks.)
Following a chart
Because of the repetitive nature of filet crochet, the instructions are usually 
depicted in chart form. (Not only would written instructions be really lengthy, 
but you’d probably lose your place and become cross-eyed in no time at all.) 
After you understand how to read a chart, you’ll find it’s much easier to follow 
than written instructions.

233
 Chapter 13: Filet and Mesh Crochet: Creating a New Style
Filet crochet charts look somewhat like graph paper. They’re made up of 
tons of squares, some of which are empty (spaces), and some of which are 
filled in (blocks). Each pattern also provides you with a chart key that explains 
what each square means and whether you work each space or block with three 
stitches or with another number of stitches that the designer may have chosen. 
Long empty spaces are bars, and the small, curved lines — the ones that look 
kind of like Vs — are the lacets (see the later section “Spacin’ Out with Lacets 
and Bars” for the scoop on these two stitches). Figure 13-1a shows a sample filet 
crochet chart, and Figure 13-1b shows a sample chart key. Note: The first double 
crochet in each of the groups of stitches in the chart key represents the last 
stitch of the previous space or block.
 
Figure 13-1: 
A sample 
filet crochet 
chart and 
key.

b
 
Each row of the chart has a number, beginning with Row 1 at the bottom and 
ending with the last row at the top. The instructions normally tell you the 
number of chains you need to make for the foundation chain, and they may or 
may not write out the first row’s instructions. Read all the odd-numbered rows 
from right to left and all the even-numbered rows from left to right (because 
you actually work the second row from the left-hand side of the piece to the 
right-hand side).
Sometimes large patterns that repeat a series of rows over and over again 
show you the repeated rows only once in the chart. The instructions tell you to 
work the chart from Row 1 to the last row and then repeat the chart, beginning 
at Row 1 again, a designated number of times to complete the project. This is 
often the case when you’re making a table runner, tablecloth, or curtains.
 
If the filet crochet chart is for a large piece, the squares may be small and hard 
to read. Make a copy of the chart and enlarge it for easier reading instead of 
working directly from the original instructions. With a copy, you can also mark 
up the chart without destroying the original. You can highlight the row you’re 
working on or place a mark next to the last row that you worked when you 
have to put your project down for a while.

234
Part III: Advanced Stitches and Techniques 
Chaining the foundation
You need to do a little bit of math in order to make your foundation chain of 
filet crochet (but we promise it’s not hard). Each block or space in a filet cro-
chet chart is actually three stitches. This means that each row of filet crochet 
has a multiple of three stitches plus one double crochet at the end to com-
plete the last space or block.
Here’s how to create a foundation chain for a sample design that calls for five 
spaces across the first row:
 
1. Multiply the number of spaces (or blocks) in the row by 3.
 
 5 × 3 = 15 chain stitches (ch).
 
2. Add 3 more chain stitches for the turning chain of the next row’s first 
double crochet stitch (dc).
 
 15 + 3 (first double crochet) = 18 chain stitches. (Refer to Chapter 5 
for more on turning chains.)
 
Getting the tension just right for your foundation chain is important. If your 
foundation chain is too tight, your design can pucker or be misshapen. If it’s 
too loose, you’ll have a lot of droopy loops hanging off the edge. The stitches 
in your foundation chain should be the same size and just big enough to fit 
your hook into comfortably. Most people have a tendency to chain too tightly. 
If you fall into this category, go to the next-largest hook size to work the foun-
dation chain. If you chain too loosely, try the next size down.
 
Nothing is more frustrating than getting to the end of your first row in a large 
design and finding out that you don’t have enough stitches. If you’re working 
on a large filet crochet design, chances are your foundation chain is several 
hundred stitches long. To avoid miscounting, crochet your foundation chain 
with a separate ball of thread. When you think you have the right number of 
chain stitches, attach a new ball of thread in the first chain stitch that you cre-
ated, working your first row from there. If you miscounted, you can easily add 
(or subtract) chain stitches at the end of the foundation row with the first ball 
of thread that you used. Fasten off the first ball of thread when you complete 
the first row and weave in the end to keep it from unraveling.
Creating spaces
If you’re armed with the foundation chain you created in the preceding sec-
tion, you’re ready to start working your first row of filet crochet. To work a 
first row of spaces, proceed as follows:
 
1. Chain 2 (ch 2) to create the top of the first space.

235
 Chapter 13: Filet and Mesh Crochet: Creating a New Style
 
 You already chained the turning chain for the first stitch when you cro-
cheted your foundation chain.
 
2. Double crochet (dc) in the eighth chain from your hook to make the 
first space.
 
 Not sure how to make a double crochet stitch? See Chapter 6.
 
3. Chain 2.
 
4. Skip the next 2 chain stitches.
 
5. Double crochet in the next chain to make the second space.
 
6. Repeat Steps 3 through 5 across the row.
 
 You work your last double crochet in the last chain of the foundation chain, 
and you should have 5 spaces at the end of the row, as in Figure 13-2.
 
Figure 13-2: 
The first 
row of filet 
crochet 
spaces.
 
To work a second row of spaces
 
1. Turn your work.
 
 Refer to Chapter 5 for the how-to on turning your work.
 
2. Chain 3 (ch 3) for the turning chain for your first double crochet (dc).
 
3. Chain 2 to make the first space.
 
4. Skip the next 2 chain stitches.
 
5. Double crochet in the next double crochet stitch to make the first 
space of the second row.
 
6. Repeat Steps 3 through 5 across the row.
 
 You should wind up with 5 spaces at the end of the second row.
Work each successive row the same way as the second row until you’re com-
fortable with the technique.
 
Take care to notice the way that the spaces form squares and that they line up 
one on top of another. Filet crochet is a symmetrical design technique, and if 
the squares are skewed, then your whole piece will look out of kilter. If you 
find that you’ve made a mistake, tear out your work to that spot and rework 
your design from there. You can’t hide mistakes in filet crochet.

236
Part III: Advanced Stitches and Techniques 
Building blocks
Blocks are what create the actual substance of a filet crochet design. Some 
designs also start with a row of blocks for the first row to create a border. 
Using the foundation chain of 15 chain stitches plus 3 for the turning chain 
(see the earlier “Chaining the foundation” section), work a first row of blocks.
 
1. Double crochet (dc) in the fourth chain (ch) from the hook.
 
 Flip to Chapter 6 to see how to make a double crochet stitch.
 
2. Double crochet in each of the next 2 chain stitches to complete the 
first block.
 
3. Double crochet in each of the next 3 chain stitches to complete the 
second block.
 
4. Repeat Step 3 across the row.
 
 You should have 5 blocks at the end of the row (or 15 double crochet 
stitches plus the turning chain), as shown in Figure 13-3. Remember: 
You always have 1 more stitch than the multiple of 3.
 
Figure 13-3: 
The first 
row of filet 
crochet 
blocks.
 
To work the second row of blocks, follow these steps:
 
1. Turn your work.
 
 See Chapter 5 for pointers on turning your work.
 
2. Chain 3 (ch 3) for the turning chain for your first double crochet (dc).
 
3. Double crochet in each of the next 3 double crochet stitches to make 
the first block.
 
4. Double crochet in each of the next 3 double crochet stitches to com-
plete the second block.
 
5. Repeat Step 4 across the row.
 
 You should have 5 blocks at the end of the second row.

237
 Chapter 13: Filet and Mesh Crochet: Creating a New Style
Combining spaces and blocks
To create the design you’re going for, you must combine spaces and blocks, 
which is easy to do because both techniques are based on three stitches.
 
As you’re crocheting, make sure your blocks and spaces line up with all the 
vertical and horizontal lines lying at right angles. The double crochet stitches 
that form the beginning and end of each block or space must line up one on 
top of the other to create the gridlike appearance.
To work a space in the next row over a block:
 
1. Work the first double crochet (dc).
 
2. Chain 2 (ch 2).
 
3. Skip the next 2 double crochet stitches.
 
 The double crochet that closes the space is actually considered the first 
stitch of the next space or block in the row.
To work a block over a space:
 
1. Double crochet (dc) in the first double crochet stitch of the space 
below.
 
2. Work 2 double crochet stitches in the chain-2 space (ch-2 sp) or in the 
2 chain stitches (ch) in the row below.
 
 You can either work your stitches in the chain space or you can work 
them directly into the chain stitches — try it both ways to see which one 
you prefer. Most crocheters find working in the space easier and neater. 
(Flip to Chapter 11 for the lowdown on working in the spaces between 
stitches.)
 
Don’t worry if the stitches look a bit skewed as you’re crocheting. After you 
finish the design, you can pin it out and starch it (see Chapter 19 for more on 
this process, which is commonly referred to as blocking) to straighten out the 
stitches.
Figure 13-4 shows a swatch of filet crochet that combines spaces and blocks. 
In this figure, the stitches are worked in the chain space.

Diving into Deeper Waters: Shaping 
Your Filet Crochet Design
You’re not limited to straight-edged, rectangular pieces in filet crochet. 
Instead, you can add interest to corners and edges by increasing or decreas-
ing the number of spaces and blocks in a row to make inset corners and step-
like edges, as explained in the following sections.
Increasing spaces and blocks
Increasing the number of spaces and blocks at the end of a row shapes the 
edges of the design. Because most filet crochet designs are symmetrical, if 
you increase at the beginning of a row, you need to increase at the end of the 
row, too. However, the process is a little different for each end.
Increasing one space at the beginning of a row
In order to increase one space at the beginning of a row, you must chain 
enough stitches to make up a space. Here’s how to work a one-space increase 
at the beginning of a row:
 
1. At the end of the row that precedes the row you’re going to increase, 
turn your work and then chain 2 (ch 2) to create the base of the first 
increase space.
 
2. Chain 3 more for the turning chain of the space’s first double crochet 
(dc).
 
3. Chain 2 more to complete the top of the first space.

239
 Chapter 13: Filet and Mesh Crochet: Creating a New Style
 
4. Double crochet in the last double crochet stitch of the previous row, 
as shown in Figure 13-5a.
 
 One increase is now complete, which you can see in Figure 13-5b. Continue 
across the row with blocks or spaces, as detailed earlier in this chapter.
 
Figure 13-5: 
Increasing 
one filet 
crochet 
space at the 
beginning of 
a row.
 a
b
Increasing more than one space at the beginning of a row
Increasing more than one space at the beginning of a row works the same 
way as increasing one space; you just have to know how many additional 
chain stitches to make for each additional space.
 
When increasing spaces, chain 2 for the first space increase and then chain 3 
more for each additional space required. The first double crochet of a row is 
always a chain 3.
Follow these steps to increase more than one space:
 
1. When you reach the end of the row that precedes the row you’re 
going to increase, turn your work and then chain 2 (ch 2) for the base 
of the first increase space.
 
2. Chain 3 more for each additional space required.
 
 The example in these steps adds 1 more space for a total of 2 increases. 
Therefore, you’re chaining a total of 5 stitches for the 2 increases.
 
3. Chain 3 more for the turning chain of the row’s first double crochet 
stitch (dc).

4. Chain 2 more for the top of the first space.

9. Chain 2 to make the top of the next space.
 
10. Skip the next 2 stitches.
 
11. Double crochet in the next double crochet stitch to make the next 
space of the row.
 
12. Repeat Steps 9 through 11 across the row to complete a row of spaces.
 
 Your completed row should look similar to Figure 13-6b.
Increasing one or more blocks at the beginning of a row
Increasing one block at the beginning of a row is similar to increasing one 
space. The big difference is that you replace the two chain stitches you make 
for the top of the space with two double crochet stitches. To increase one 
block at the beginning of a row, proceed as follows:
 
1. At the end of the row that precedes the row you’re going to increase, 
turn your work and then chain 2 (ch 2) to make the base of the first 
increase block.
 
2. Chain 3 more to complete the turning chain of the block’s first double 
crochet stitch (dc).

241
 Chapter 13: Filet and Mesh Crochet: Creating a New Style
 
3. Double crochet in the fourth chain from the hook to complete the 
second double crochet stitch of the block. (See Figure 13-7a.)
 
4. Double crochet in each of the next 2 chain stitches to complete the 
block.
 
 The first block increase is now complete; yours should look like the one 
in Figure 13-7b. From here, continue making blocks or spaces across 
the row.

one block at 
the start of a 
row.

To increase additional blocks, follow the same steps for increasing one block, 
but remember the additional chain stitches you need to make for the addi-
tional blocks. Here’s the simple math: Chain 2 for your first increase block, 
chain 3 more for each additional block, and then chain 3 for the turning chain 
of the row’s first double crochet. So if you want to increase 2 blocks at the 
beginning of a row, you chain 2 for the first block, 3 for the second block, 
and 3 more for the turning chain, which is 11 chain stitches total.
After you chain the required number of stitches, follow Steps 3 and 4 in the 
previous list to make the first block; then work another set of three double 
crochet stitches for the other increase block (see Figure 13-8).

Part III: Advanced Stitches and Techniques 
Increasing one or more spaces at the end of a row
When you need to increase a space at the end of a row, you start at the top of 
the last double crochet in the row just prior to the increase. In order to create 
the extra space(s), you work a chain-2 space followed by a stitch called a triple 
triple crochet (abbreviated trtr), which is one step taller than a double triple 
crochet stitch (presented in Chapter 6). By working a triple triple crochet 
stitch, you create a length equivalent to five chain stitches, which is what you 
need to make one filet space — two chain stitches for the width of the space 
plus three chain stitches for the height of one double crochet.
To increase one space at the end of a row, follow these instructions:
 
1. Chain 2 (ch 2) to create the top of the first space.
 
2. Yarn over the hook (yo) 4 times.
 
3. Insert your hook into the same stitch as the last double crochet stitch 
(dc) that you worked, like in Figure 13-9a.
 
4. Yarn over and draw the yarn through the stitch.
 
5. Yarn over and draw the yarn through the first 2 loops on the hook.
 
6. Repeat Step 5 three times until you have 1 loop on the hook, completing 
1 triple triple crochet (trtr).
 
 Figure 13-9b shows 1 completed space increase at the end of a row.

To increase more than one space at the end of a row, you just repeat the steps 
for increasing one space. The only difference is that in Step 3, you insert the 
hook in the middle of the post of the triple triple crochet that you made for 
the first space increase. Refer to Figure 13-10 to see what we mean, and flip to 
Chapter 5 if you need a refresher on stitch parts.

Increasing one or more blocks at the end of a row
Increasing a block at the end of a row is a bit tricky but still relatively simple. 
The key is to make sure you don’t tighten up too much on your stitches.
 
When increasing blocks, you use a triple crochet stitch rather than a double 
crochet. The extra length compensates for not having a row of chain stitches 
to serve as the base.
Here’s how to increase one block at the end of a row:
 
1. Yarn over (yo) twice.
 
2. Insert your hook into the top of the last stitch of the previous row, 
which is where you just worked the last double crochet (dc) of the cur-
rent row. (Refer to Figure 13-11a.)
 
3. Yarn over and draw the yarn through the stitch.
 
4. Yarn over and draw the yarn through the first 2 loops on the hook.
 
5. Repeat Step 4 twice.
 
 You now have 1 loop remaining on your hook and have completed 1 
triple crochet (tr) as well as the second stitch of the block.
 
6. Yarn over twice.
 
7. Insert your hook near the bottom of the post of the last triple crochet 
that you made, as shown in Figure 13-11b.
 
8. Yarn over and draw the yarn through the first 2 loops on the hook.

9. Repeat Step 8 twice until you have just 1 loop on the hook (completing 
1 triple crochet).
 
10. Repeat Steps 7 through 9 (completing the third stitch of the block).
 
 See Figure 13-12 for the visual.
 
Figure 13-12: 
A complete

at the end 
of a row.
 
 
After you master increasing one block, increasing more than one is easy. You 
just repeat Steps 7 through 9 three times for each additional block that you want.
Decreasing spaces and blocks
The method for decreasing both spaces and blocks is the same. It’s simply a 
matter of counting.
Decreasing spaces or blocks at the beginning of a row
To decrease one space or block at the beginning of a row, simply slip stitch 
across to where you want to begin the first space or block.
 
1. At the end of the row immediately before the row you’re decreasing, 
turn your work.
 
2. Slip stitch (sl st) across 3 stitches for each space or block that you’re 
decreasing.
 
 If you’re decreasing 1 space or block, then slip stitch across 3 stitches; if
you’re decreasing 2 spaces or blocks, slip stitch across 6 stitches. 
(Check out Chapter 5 for the scoop on making slip stitches.)
 
3. Slip stitch in the next stitch.
 
 Doing so brings your hook into the correct stitch to begin your first 
space or block of the row.
 
4. Chain 3 (ch 3) for the turning chain of the row’s first double crochet 
(dc). (See Figure 13-13.)
 
5. Work across the row with either blocks or spaces.

Decreasing spaces or blocks at the end of a row
The method for decreasing spaces or blocks at the end of a row is the same 
regardless of how many you need to decrease. You work across the row fol-
lowing the chart, stop crocheting at the point where you want to make the 
decrease, and then turn your work to begin the next row. Keep in mind that 
the decrease must end with a double crochet stitch or a complete space 
or block. Figure 13-14 shows the decrease at the end of a row after you’ve 
turned and are ready to begin the next row.

Spacin’ Out with Lacets and Bars
Lacets and bars are two more filet crochet stitches that create an elegant, lacy 
look. Despite their fancy names, you work them with just double crochet, chain, 
and single crochet stitches, but the spacing is different. Instead of working them 
across three stitches, you work them in six stitches or two spaces. (Remember: 
The last stitch that completes the block is really the first stitch of the next 
space or block.) Not all filet crochet designs incorporate these fancy-schmancy 
stitches, but they can add interest to a design. See how to make them in the next 
sections.
Getting fancy with lacets
A lacet, which is sometimes called a fancy stitch, looks somewhat like a V and 
is worked across five stitches or the interior width of two spaces. To make a 
lacet, proceed as follows:
 
1. Work the first double crochet (dc) as you would to begin a regular 
block or space.
 
 See the sections “Building blocks” or “Creating spaces,” earlier in this 
chapter, for guidance.
 
2. Chain 3 (ch 3).
 
3. Skip the next 2 stitches.
 
4. Single crochet (sc) in the next stitch.
 
 See Chapter 5 for the basics on working single crochet.
 
 If you’re working the lacet over a bar (a double space), you can work the 
single crochet in the center chain stitch or in the chain loop, whichever 
you prefer. If you’re working it over 2 separate spaces or blocks, then 
work the single crochet in the center double crochet between the first 
and second space or block.
 
5. Chain 3.
 
6. Skip the next 2 stitches.
 
7. Double crochet in the next double crochet to complete 1 lacet.
 
 Figure 13-15 depicts a completed lacet over 2 spaces.

247
 Chapter 13: Filet and Mesh Crochet: Creating a New Style
 
Figure 13-15: 
A finished 
lacet over 
two spaces.
 
Bridging the gap with bars
Bars, sometimes referred to as double spaces, are long spaces that cross 
over the two blocks or spaces or the one lacet below them. They’re generally 
worked over a lacet. To make a bar:
 
1. Work the first double crochet (dc) as you would to begin a regular 
block or space.
 
 Refer to the sections “Building blocks” or “Creating spaces,” earlier in 
this chapter, for help with this step.
 
2. Chain 5 (ch 5).
 
3. Skip the next 5 stitches or 2 spaces.
 
4. Double crochet in the next double crochet stitch to complete 1 bar.
 
 To see what a completed bar looks like, check out Figure 13-16.

worked over 
a lacet.

Making Mesh, the Simplest Lace
By crocheting mesh stitch patterns, also called net or trellis patterns, you 
can quickly work up simple lace that you can use for many types of projects. 
When paired with delicate yarns, mesh is great for crocheting elegant scarves 
and summer camisoles. Worked up in a sturdier yarn, such as cotton, mesh 
helps you create lace curtains and bags.
For the basic mesh stitch pattern, use the instructions for making spaces in 
filet crochet (see the earlier “Creating spaces” section for the how-to) to create 
a simple gridlike pattern of open squares that are neatly stacked on top of each 
other. To vary up your basic mesh stitch pattern, try the brick stitch. When 
worked with a sturdy cotton yarn, the brick stitch is perfect for making bags 
(like the later String Market Bag project). You can also use this mesh stitch 
variation to create a light, airy scarf for fall out of warm, worsted merino wool.
Follow these steps to work the brick stitch:
 
1. Chain 32 (ch 32).
 
2. Double crochet (dc) in the 12th chain from the hook.
 
 The 11 skipped stitches make up 4 skipped chains, 1 double crochet (3 
chains), and a chain-4 space (ch-4 sp).
 
3. Chain 4, skip 4 chain stitches, and work 1 double crochet in the next 
chain stitch.
 
4. Repeat Step 3 across to the end of the row and then turn.
 
 You should have 5 brick-shaped spaces.

249
 Chapter 13: Filet and Mesh Crochet: Creating a New Style
Here’s how to work the second row of brick stitch:
 
1. Chain 5 (ch 5).
 
 These chains count as 1 triple crochet (tr) and 2 chains.
 
2. Double crochet (dc) in the first chain-4 space (ch-4 sp).
 
 Flip to Chapter 11 for help working into spaces and loops.
 
3. Chain 4 and work 1 double crochet in the next chain-4 space.
 
4. Repeat Step 2 across to the chain-4 space before the space made by 
the turning chain in the previous row.
 
5. Chain 4, work 1 double crochet in the turning chain space, chain 2, 
double crochet in the seventh chain of the turning chain, and turn.
To work the third row of the brick stitch pattern:
 
1. Chain 7 (ch 7).
 
 These chains count as 1 double crochet (dc) and 4 chain stitches.
 
2. Work 1 double crochet in the next chain-4 space (ch-4 sp); then chain 4.
 
3. Repeat Step 2 across to the turning chain; work 1 double crochet in 
the third chain of the turning chain and then turn.
Keep repeating Rows 2 and 3, and you’ll see an alternating block pattern form 
that resembles a brick pattern. Check out a finished swatch of brick stitch in 
Figure 13-18.
 
Figure 13-18: 
A swatch 
of the 
brick stitch 
pattern.
 
 
By changing the number of chains in a basic mesh pattern, you can create a 
space that’s wider or narrower. By changing the stitch height, substituting 
the double crochet for the single crochet or triple crochet, you can make the 
space shorter or taller.

Butterfly Runner Project
This beautiful filet crochet runner is a simple rectangle that uses spaces, 
blocks, bars, and lacets. We made the sample in the color section by using 
size 20 thread with a size 12 (0.75 mm) steel hook, but if you’d feel more com-
fortable using the larger size 10 thread with a size 7 (1.50 mm) steel hook, go 
right ahead. Your finished design will be larger but just as pretty.
 
If you’re feeling pretty confident and want to spice up the runner a tad, you 
can shape the corners of it by using the increasing and decreasing technique. 
The runner shown in the color section of this book features this corner varia-
tion. (Don’t worry. We include another chart and directions to help you with 
this change.)

▶ Playing with motifs of varying shapes and sizes
▶ Adorning yourself with a pair of classic earrings
▶ Creating blossoming flowers
A
fter you know a few basic stitches and techniques, you’re ready to crochet 
motifs. Considered the building blocks of crochet, motifs are small pieces 
that can be used on their own as doilies, jewelry, or appliqués. You can also 
join them together to create larger projects such as scarves, bags, or afghans. 
Because they’re small and quick to stitch, motifs are great for using up bits and 
pieces of leftover yarn. If you like to take your projects with you, motifs are the 
perfect project for the crocheter on the go, fitting easily into your purse or bag.
Often using a foundation of simple geometric or nature-inspired patterns, 
motifs can be a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. The possibilities are end-
less. This chapter shows you how to morph rounds (which we introduce in 
Chapter 8) into granny squares, which are the foundation of many square 
motifs. We also show you examples of a few playful motifs that you can use as 
decorative accents for your home or wardrobe, or as inspiration for your own 
designs. Motifs are a great way to get used to looking at stitch diagrams, so we 
give you the text instructions along with a stitch diagram for each motif.
At the end of this chapter, you can practice your new skills with a supersimple 
project that’ll have you in a pair of pretty raindrop earrings in less than an 
hour. Or you can try out the Flower Power project, which leaves you with a 
three-dimensional appliqué flower you can use to garnish gifts and accessories.
Granny’s a Square: Cornering Your Rounds
Just because you can work in rounds doesn’t mean you can only make cir-
cles. Turning a circle into a square is very simple to do; just add four corners 
to your round. The granny square is an extremely common circle-turned-
square that has been the foundation of crochet fashion for decades. In the 

256
Part III: Advanced Stitches and Techniques 
following sections, we explain how to work a few rounds of the granny square 
motif; see Chapter 8 for an introduction to crocheting in the round.
The first round
Figure 14-1 is the stitch diagram for the granny square; it shows you how the 
rounds square off with the addition of four short chain loops for the corners. 
To start a typical granny square, follow these steps:
 
1. Chain 4 (ch 4).
 
2. Close into a ring with 1 slip stitch (sl st) in the first chain.
 
 This is your center ring.
Next, follow these instructions to complete the first round of your granny 
square:
 
1. Chain 3 (ch 3) for your first double crochet (dc) and then work 2 more 
double crochet stitches into the ring. Chain 2.
 
 Here’s your first corner.
 
2. Work 3 more double crochet stitches into the ring and chain 2.
 
3. Repeat Step 2 twice.
 
 Tada! You now have your 4 corners, and each one is made of a chain-2 
space between the sets of 3 double crochets.
 
4. Join the round by working 1 slip stitch in the top of the turning chain 
(without turning your work).
The second round
To go on to the second round of the granny square, proceed as follows:
 
1. Slip stitch (sl st) across to the first chain-2 space (ch-2 sp) and then 
chain 3 (ch 3) for the first double crochet (dc).
 
 Refer to Chapter 5 for info on traveling across stitches with the slip stitch.
 
2. Work 2 double crochet stitches in the first chain-2 space, chain 2, and 
then work 3 more double crochet stitches in the same chain-2 space. 
Chain 1.
 
3. Work 3 double crochet stitches, chain 2, and then work 3 more double 
crochet stitches all in the next chain-2 space. Chain 1.
 
4. Repeat Step 3 twice to get to the last side of the motif; work 1 slip 
stitch in the top of the turning chain to join.

The third round and beyond
 
1. Slip stitch (sl st) across to the first chain-2 space (ch-2 sp) and then 
chain 3 (ch 3) for the first double crochet (dc).
 
2. Work 2 double crochet stitches in the first chain-2 space, chain 2, and 
then work 3 more double crochet stitches in the same chain-2 space. 
Chain 1.
 
3. Work 3 double crochet stitches in the next chain-1 space. Chain 1.
 
4. Work 3 double crochet stitches, chain 2, and then work 3 more double 
crochet stitches all in the next chain-2 space. Chain 1.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 twice to get to the last side of the motif; repeat Step 
3 once more; work 1 slip stitch in the top of the turning chain to join.
 
You can add as many rounds as you want to the granny square. Heck, you 
can make it as big as an entire afghan if you want to. Just remember that each 
successive round has additional chain-1 spaces across the sides. Simply work 
three double crochet stitches, followed by a chain 1, in each space across 
the sides and work your corners the same way. (To see a completed granny 
square with four rounds, check out Figure 14-2.)

Don’t Be Square: Motifs 
of Different Shapes
Squares and circles aren’t the only ways to create motifs. They can have 
other geometric angles, such as stars and hexagons, or they can be fun 
shapes like hearts, raindrops, or flowers. Start with the motifs in the next sec-
tions and then use your newfound skills to try out motifs on your own.
The lacy hexagon motif
Commonly worked in the round, polygons such as triangles (which have 
three sides) and hexagons (which have six sides) follow the same concept as 
the granny square described earlier in this chapter; to shape them, you just 
need a different number of corners. Figure 14-3 shows the stitch diagram for 
a lacy hexagon motif with four rounds. Follow these simple instructions to 
start the motif:
 
1. Chain 4 (ch 4).
 
2. Close into a ring with 1 slip stitch (sl st) in the first chain.
 
 This is the center ring.
Work the first round as follows:
 
1. Chain 3 (ch 3) to create the first double crochet (dc); then work 1 
double crochet into the ring and chain 2.

259
 Chapter 14: Building on Your Skills with Motifs
 
2. Work 2 double crochet stitches and 2 chains into the ring 5 times; slip 
stitch (sl st) into the top of the turning chain to join.
 
 You should have 6 chain-2 spaces (ch-2 sp) and 6 pairs of double cro-
chet stitches.
To make the second round:
 
1. Slip stitch (sl st) across to the next chain-2 space (ch-2 sp); then chain 3 
(ch 3) for the first double crochet (dc).
 
2. Work 1 double crochet, 2 chains, and 2 double crochet in the same 
chain-2 space. Chain 1.
 
3. Work 2 double crochet, 2 chains, and 2 double crochet in the next 
chain-2 space. Chain 1.
 
4. Repeat Step 3 in each chain-2 space (the corner spaces) around; then 
slip stitch in the top of the beginning turning chain to join.
 
If you want to make the lacy hexagon motif larger, simply continue adding 
rounds (refer to Figure 14-3, which shows four rounds). With each round you’ll 
have one more chain-1 space, across the sides. Work two double crochet 
stitches in each chain-1 space, followed by a chain 1, across the sides and 
work your corners the same as you did on the first two rounds. Figure 14-4 
shows a sample of a completed lacy hexagon motif.

You can also form many geometric shapes (such as hexagons and triangles) 
by working in rows and using the increasing and decreasing techniques found 
in Chapter 7.
The flat flower motif
Motif shapes don’t have to be found in the geometry classroom; you may be 
inspired to make them from objects you find in nature or around your home. 
For example, attach a chain of green yarn to a circle crocheted in red yarn, 
and you have a delicious cherry. This section features instructions for creat-
ing a wonderful flat flower motif. Treat it as a topper for gifts and hats, or use 
it to add a little beauty to everyday items such as barrettes, bags, and even 
jeans.
Figure 14-5 shows the stitch diagram for three rounds of the flat flower motif. 
To start creating the motif, follow these steps:
 
1. Chain 6 (ch 6).
 
2. Close into a ring with 1 slip stitch (sl st) in the first ch.
 
 This is the center ring.
Now, follow these instructions to complete the first three rounds:
 
1. Chain 1 (ch 1) and work 15 single crochet stitches (sc) into the ring; 
slip stitch (sl st) in the first single crochet to join.
 
 The first round is complete.

261
 Chapter 14: Building on Your Skills with Motifs
 
2. Chain 1 and single crochet in the first single crochet.
 
3. Chain 3, skip the next 2 single crochet, and then single crochet in the

Figure 14-6 depicts a completed flower motif that you can use on its own or as 
the foundation for multiple layers, as shown in the next section.
The layered flower motif
Some motifs have multiple layers for a pleasing three-dimensional appear-
ance. These types of motifs are good decorative accents for your wardrobe 
all on their own, but if you want, you can join them together to make a larger 

262
Part III: Advanced Stitches and Techniques 
piece. In the preceding section, we show you how to make a flat flower motif 
(a flower with only one layer). In this section, you find out how to add layers 
to create a blossoming flower.

A completed 
sample 
of the flat 
flower motif.
 
Figure 14-7 shows the stitch diagram for the layered flower motif. Begin with 
the flat flower motif described in the preceding section, but don’t fasten off. 
To work the second layer of petals (which consists of two rounds), follow 
these steps:
 
1. Chain 4 (ch 4), skip the next 6 stitches, and then slip stitch (sl st) in the 
next single crochet (sc).
 
2. Repeat Step 1 around the motif 4 times to make a total of 5 chain-4 
loops (ch-4 lps).
 
3. Slip stitch in the first chain-4 loop. Chain 1.
 
4. Work 1 single crochet, 1 half double crochet (hdc), 2 double crochet 
(dc), 1 triple crochet (tr), 2 double crochet, 1 half double crochet, and 
1 single crochet in each chain-4 loop around.
 
5. Slip stitch in the first single crochet to join.
You’ve worked two rounds of a multilayered flower with these instructions, 
so now you’re ready to compare your work to the sample in Figure 14-8. 
Continue adding layers with the Flower Power project at the end of this 
chapter to make a bigger blossoming flower.

Joining flower motifs is pretty easy if you sew petals at the tips or join them 
on the last round as you go (refer to Chapter 15 for joining methods). To 
join the flower petals on the last round, begin the last round of the flower as 
usual until you’ve made the first triple crochet stitch. Work one slip stitch in 
the triple crochet stitch on an already completed flower motif; then continue 

264
Part III: Advanced Stitches and Techniques 
working the petals as before. Repeat the slip stitch method of joining stitches 
on the next petal so the flowers are connected at two petals. Make several 
flower motifs, using a variety of colors, and then join them together in a single 
row for a colorful scarf. Or try joining multiple rows together to make a garden-
inspired shawl, bag, or blanket.
Raindrop Earrings Project
Using basic crochet stitches, you can fashion a pair of elegant earrings in a 
raindrop motif in just under an hour. These earrings are crocheted with mer-
cerized crochet thread and a steel hook and then slightly stiffened to hold 
their shape. The color shown in the color section matches the cuff bracelet in 
Chapter 15, but if it doesn’t appeal to you, go ahead and change it. Whatever 
color you choose, this project will make a wonderful accessory for you, your 
friends, and your family members.
 
You can make jewelry out of almost any crochet motif just by using crochet 
thread and a steel hook. Some motifs can be quite large, so feel free to experi-
ment, working just two or three rounds to keep your project small and light.

Directions
The directions here tell you how to make a raindrop motif and then assemble 
the earrings with common jewelry findings. We give them to you in standard 
crochet language, but if they seem like a bunch of gibberish, refer to Chapter 
4 for help reading patterns. The stitch diagram in Figure 14-9 also shows you 
where to make your stitches.

Fasten off and weave in the ends using the yarn needle.
Finishing
Place the motifs into a bowl or a plastic baggie. Pour in equal parts water and 
fabric stiffener; there should be just enough to cover the motifs completely. 
Allow the motifs to become completely saturated; this should take 2 or 3 
minutes. Remove the motifs from the mixture and dab with paper towels to 
remove excess stiffener. Lay the motifs out on a piece of parchment paper, 
shape them to the desired size, and allow them to dry completely.
Assembly
Using your fingers, open 1 jump ring and place it in the ch-3 space at the top 
of the motif. Join the earring hook to the jump ring and press the jump ring 
closed. Repeat for the second motif.

Flower Power Project
The three-dimensional flowers in this project (shown in the color section) are 
quick and easy to make — plus they let you show off your new motif skills. 
They make great package toppers, or you can eliminate the ties and sew 
them onto a hat.
 
This project gives you two different color options: Use one color of yarn 
for the whole flower or two different solid colors to create different-colored 
petals. You can also make the flowers smaller by using a lighter-weight yarn 
such as sport-weight with a size F-5 (3.75 mm) hook. To make them even 
smaller and more delicate, use cotton thread and a size 7 steel (1.5 mm) hook.

One-color flower
Work the layered flower motif described earlier in this chapter. Then work an 
additional layer of petals as follows:
Rnd 1: * Ch 5, skip next 8 sts, sl st in next sc *; rep from * to * around (5 
chain-5 loops [ch-5 lps] made).

lp around (5 petals made), sl st in first sc to join. Fasten off.
Two-toned flower
For a two-toned flower, you work the stitches the same way as in the one-
color flower. Work the center ring and Round 1 in the first color. Fasten off 
the first color and join the second color. Work Rounds 2–5 in the second 
color. Fasten off and join the first color to work Rounds 6 and 7.

Ties
If you want to tie the flower to a package, make a tie in your desired color.
Make a chain 2 inches longer than the combined circumference of the pack-
age in both directions. Fasten off, leaving a 6-inch sewing length. Wrap the tie 
around the package in both directions, with the ends meeting at the center 
top. Tie the ends in a knot at the center top.
Curlicues
Create as many curlicues as desired in colors to match or contrast with your 
flowers.
Make a chain long enough to reach from the flower to the edge of the pack-
age.
Row 1: 3 sc in second ch from hook, 3 sc in each ch across. Fasten off, leav-
ing a 6-in. sewing length. With yarn needle and sewing lengths, sew 1 end to 
WS of Rnd 1 of flower as desired.
Finishing
Arrange the flower on top of the package as desired. With a yarn needle and 
the extra sewing lengths, sew the flower to the ties.

A
 crocheted project is rarely complete when you fasten 
off the last row or round. Certain finishing tech-
niques help to complement and enhance your project.
This part presents several methods for neatly joining proj-

ing touches and embellishments. You also find out all you 
need to know about sweater basics and construction so 
you can make the simple garments featured in Chapters 16

W
hether you’re working with the seams of a garment, the individual 
motifs of an afghan, or the long panels of a shawl, the techniques 
for joining crocheted pieces are many and varied. Do you want a visible or 
an invisible seam? Is the seam an integral part of the overall design, or is it 
purely functional? Should you crochet the seam, or do you feel more comfort-
able sewing it?
If you’re crocheting a design pattern, the instructions usually tell you how to 
put the pieces together. However, if you don’t care for that method or you 
just want to try another one, feel free to experiment. This chapter details sev-
eral joining methods so you can choose the one that’s best for you, and the 
project at the end of this chapter gives you an opportunity to try out joining 
on the last round. The Simple Sweater project in Chapter 16 and the Girl’s 
Versatile Camisole project in Chapter 17 let you practice other methods for 
creating seams.
 
No matter which method you use to join your pieces together, you definitely 
want to keep them evenly aligned so you don’t end up with extra fabric stick-
ing out on one side or the other when you’re all done. To make sure you’re 
joining the pieces together evenly, pin them together with a few sewing pins 
or safety pins. Start by pinning the pieces together at the top, then the middle, 
and finally the bottom. If you see lots of space between the pins, add a few 
more to fill in the gaps. Then remove the pins as you work your seam.

272
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
Sewing Pieces Together
When the seams of a piece are functional rather than decorative, sewing 
them together is probably your best bet. A sewn seam is flexible and nearly 
invisible, plus it doesn’t add any additional bulk. You don’t need a sewing 
machine or many special tools to join pieces by sewing; just grab a yarn 
needle or a tapestry needle, whichever works with the material you’re using, 
and the leftover yarn or cotton that you used to crochet your design. (See 
Chapter 2 for more information on needles.)
When you want to sew pieces together, you have a variety of stitches to 
choose from, namely the whipstitch, the blanket stitch, the mattress stitch, 
and the backstitch. Each of these stitches has its purpose, and your pattern 
should tell you which one to use in your project. If it doesn’t, know that the 
whipstitch is always a good stitch to lean on. We guide you through the pro-
cess of creating these stitches in the following sections.
 
Regardless of whether you’re working with the whipstitch, the blanket stitch, 
the mattress stitch, or the backstitch, take care not to pull the yarn too tight 
as you sew. If you do, the fabric will pucker. Keep your stitches even and neat, 
and you’re sure to end up with a beautifully finished seam.
 
If the design you’re sewing together has a striped pattern, leave a yarn tail at 
least 6 inches long at the beginning and end of each stripe. This way you have 
the correct yarn colors available and positioned right where you need them 
when you’re ready to sew the pieces together. To do just that, slip your yarn 
needle onto the tail and sew the corresponding color stripes together. (This 
move saves you a lot of time when you’re finishing up your project.)
Whipping up the whipstitch 
for shorter stitches
The whipstitch is best for joining rows made up of the shorter stitches, such 
as single crochet, half double crochet, and double crochet. When you’re 
sewing the side seams of a garment, you join the pieces by sewing the row-
ends together. When you’re sewing shoulder seams or motifs, you generally 
work in the tops of the stitches. The key to joining seams together success-
fully with the whipstitch is to match up the crocheted stitches on each side 
of the seam using straight, even stitches and without pulling too tightly. For 
projects that use the whipstitch, check out the Simple Sweater project in 
Chapter 16 and the Girl’s Versatile Camisole project in Chapter 17.

273
 Chapter 15: Connecting the Parts: Joining Seams
 
Whipstitching seams together while holding the right sides of the fabric facing 
each other is a common technique that allows the seam to be hidden on the 
inside of your project. The whipstitch can also be used to create a decorative 
seam, especially when you’re sewing motifs together. To do this, put the 
wrong sides of the motifs facing each other, match their stitches across each 
edge, and sew the motifs together through the back loops of the stitches only. 
Doing so creates a raised ridge on the right side of the work.
To make a whipstitch:
 
1. Position the pieces with right sides (or wrong sides, depending on the 
pattern) facing each other, taking care to match the stitches across 
each side edge.
 
2. Using a yarn needle and matching yarn, weave the yarn back and 
forth through several stitches on one of the pieces to secure the end.
 
 You can tie a small knot at the beginning of the seam if you want to 
secure it better, but it usually isn’t necessary.
 
3. Insert the needle and pull the yarn through the inside loops of the 
first 2 corresponding stitches of the 2 pieces to be joined.
 
 Figure 15-1 shows the correct positioning of the needle in the inside 
loops.
 
Figure 15-1: 
Making a 
whipstitch.
 
 
4. Draw the needle up and over the 2 loops of the first stitch.
 
 Pull the yarn tightly enough so the pieces of fabric are fairly snug against 
each other, but not so tightly that the stitches become distorted.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 across the edges to be joined.
 
6. At the end of the seam, weave the yarn back through several stitches 
to secure.
 
 If you’re not sure how to weave in ends, flip to Chapter 5. Otherwise, 
check out Figure 15-2 to see a completed whipstitch seam.

Saving the blanket stitch for taller stitches
The blanket stitch is a good choice when you’re joining pieces consisting of 
taller stitches, such as triple crochet and taller. This stitch adds some stabil-
ity to the backside of the seam and reduces the seam’s tendency to gap.
 
Always join taller stitches at the top and at the base, which is how the stitches 
are joined to each other within the fabric.
To make a blanket stitch, follow these steps:
 
1. With the correct sides facing each other (right side/wrong side, 
depending on the pattern), open up the pieces and lay them side by 
side on a flat, smooth surface, aligning the edges and stitches.
 
2. Using a yarn needle and matching yarn, thread the yarn through the 
base of the first few corresponding stitches, leaving a yarn length of 6 
to 8 inches to weave in later to secure the seam.
 
3. Lay the working end of the yarn against the fabric in the direction of 
the stitches, as shown in Figure 15-3.
 
4. Thread your yarn through the base of the next 2 corresponding 
stitches, making sure that the working end of the yarn is underneath 
the needle (refer to Figure 15-3).
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 across the edges to be joined.
 
6. At the end of the seam, weave the yarn back through several stitches 
to secure.
 
 Figure 15-4 shows a complete blanket stitch seam, and Chapter 5 
explains how to weave in ends if you need a refresher.

Creating invisible seams 
with the mattress stitch
The mattress stitch, also known as the invisible seam or invisible weaving, 
is a very flexible seam that works best for sewing garment pieces together 
because it makes for a flat, invisible seam. You always work this stitch with 
the right sides facing up so you can make sure the seam is invisible on its 

276
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
best side. The key to this stitch is to make small stitches, weaving your 
needle back and forth between the two pieces while working up the inside of 
the edges to be joined.
Here’s how to use the mattress stitch to sew the row ends of two pieces 
worked in double crochet:
 
1. Place the pieces to be joined on a flat table with the right sides facing 
you.
 
 The pieces should be side by side. Make sure the stitches themselves 
are aligned and that any stripes or patterns are aligned too. (If you’re 
having trouble keeping everything aligned, you can always use safety 
pins or sewing pins to keep the 2 pieces together.)
 
2. With an 18-inch length of yarn (or the long tail end) threaded onto a 
yarn needle, insert the needle up through the bottom-most stitch of 
1 piece and out the middle of the post, or turning chain, of the same 
stitch, as shown in Figure 15-5a.
 
 If you’re not using a tail end, leave a 6-inch tail with your first stitch so 
you can weave it in later.
 
3. Insert your needle up through the corresponding stitch of the second 
piece and out the middle of the post, or turning chain, of the stitch, 
like in Figure 15-5b.
 
 If you aren’t using a secured tail end, weave the needle through the 
same stitches referenced in Steps 2 and 3 to secure the yarn.
 
4. Insert your needle in the same spot where the last stitch came out 
on the opposite piece and bring it up and out the top of the double 
crochet stitch (dc), as in Figure 15-6a.
 
5. Insert your needle in the same spot of the corresponding double cro-
chet on the second piece and draw it out of the top of the double 
crochet. (Refer to Figure 15-6b.)

6. Pull the yarn to draw the 2 pieces together, but not so tight that the 
fabric puckers.
 
7. Continue weaving your needle back and forth as you move up the 
inside edges, making 2 stitches along the post of each double crochet 
on each piece to be joined (see Figure 15-7).
 
Figure 15-7:

8. To fasten off, weave the yarn back and forth 1 more time through the 
last 2 stitches worked and cut the yarn, leaving a 6-inch tail for 
weaving in.

stitch. Figure 15-8a shows the opened mattress stitch; Figure 15-8b shows the 
complete, closed mattress stitch.

278
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
 
You can work the mattress stitch to join pieces of any stitch height. Just make 
sure you weave the yarn back and forth using evenly spaced stitches. For 
single crochet stitches, simply insert the needle through the bottom-most 
stitch and out the top of the same stitch; then do the same for the correspond-
ing stitch on the second piece. For the next row, move up to the next stitch. 
For the triple crochet, weave the needle back and forth three times for each 
post before moving on to the next row.
 
If you’re using the mattress stitch along the top loops of a row, simply follow 
the preceding steps for sewing the row ends; just be sure to keep your 
stitches short.
Fashioning sturdy seams 
with the backstitch
The backstitch produces a strong, bulky seam that doesn’t have a lot of 
stretch. Use it whenever you need to join two pieces together with a sturdy 
seam, like for bags or baskets. You work the backstitch on the wrong side of 
the project because it’s visible (and not exactly pretty).
 
The key to understanding the backstitch is to think of it as two steps forward 
and one step back. This is because you bring the needle to the front of your 
fabric two spaces forward and then push it to the back of the fabric one 
space back.
You can use the backstitch to join pieces along the tops or sides of the parts 
that need joining. If you’re working along the top edges, simply stitch the 
seam under the top loops of a stitch. If you’re working along the side edges, 
insert your needle under the two threads found along the side of the stitch’s 
post. (See Chapter 5 for a refresher on stitch anatomy.)
To join two pieces along the top edge by using the backstitch:
 
1. Pin the 2 pieces together with their right sides facing each other and 
their edges aligned.
 
 If you’re seaming the sides of the pieces, make sure the rows are lined 
up; if you’re seaming the top edges of the pieces, make sure their 
stitches are lined up.
 
2. With an 18-inch length of yarn (or the long tail end) threaded onto 
your yarn needle, insert the needle from front to back under the top 
loops of the first stitch, pushing the needle through both layers.

279
 Chapter 15: Connecting the Parts: Joining Seams
 
 Figure 15-9a illustrates this step, which starts at the upper-right corner 
and gets worked from right to left if you’re right-handed. Lefties do the 
reverse.
 
3. Bring the needle back to the front about a 1⁄4 inch farther along the 
seam, as shown in Figure 15-9b.
 
 You’re always working through both layers.
 
Figure 15-9: 
Beginning a 
backstitch 
seam.
 
a
b
 
4. Bring the needle back to the first spot and insert it from front to back.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 twice.
 
 You’ve now secured the yarn to the beginning of the seam, so you’re 
ready to start backstitching.
 
6. Bring the needle back to the front a 1⁄2 inch farther along the seam.
 
 This is about a 1⁄4 inch farther than where you brought it to the front the 
last time, as you can see in Figure 15-10a — hence the “2 spaces forward” 
concept.
 
7. Insert the needle from front to back a 1⁄4 inch back along the seam. 
(Refer to Figure 15-10b.)
 
 This is the same spot where you brought the yarn to the front on the 
last stitch, hence the “1 space back” idea.
 
8. Repeat Steps 6 and 7 as you work along the seam edge to the end des-
ignated by your pattern.
 
9. To secure the yarn, work the last stitch 2 or 3 times in the same spots 
and then cut the yarn, leaving a 6-inch tail for weaving in later.

Crocheting Pieces Together
Sometimes a pattern asks you to crochet your seams, whether for functional 
or decorative purposes. A crocheted seam is strong and comes in handy 
when joining pieces that are going to be put through a lot of wear and tear, 
such as motifs in an afghan. It can also become a part of your design if you 
work it on the right side of the fabric.
 
If the wrong sides of the pieces are facing each other when you join a seam, 
then the crocheted seam appears on the right side. If the right sides are 
facing, then the crocheted seam appears on the wrong side. Take a few sec-
onds to make sure your pieces are facing in the correct direction based on 
where you want your seam to appear before joining them. Trust us, ripping 
out a seam is pretty frustrating.

281
 Chapter 15: Connecting the Parts: Joining Seams
In the following sections, we show you different methods for crocheting your 
pieces together with slip stitches, single crochet stitches, and more.
Joining with a slip stitch seam
A slip stitch seam is secure but a little inflexible. When you work it on the wrong 
side of the fabric, this seam is great for items that take a beating, like purses 
and tote bags. If worked on the right side of the fabric, the slip stitch seam 
looks like an embroidered chain stitch. You can join pieces with the slip stitch 
to create two different looks: a ridged seam or a flat seam. The Girl’s Versatile 
Camisole project in Chapter 17 is an example of joining pieces with a slip stitch 
seam.
Creating a ridged seam
If you choose to create a ridge along your seam, you can either hide it (on 
the wrong side of the fabric) or make it part of the design (on the right side). 
Ridged seams are sometimes used to create a decorative look, like in an 
afghan made up of motifs; you can use a contrasting color to add another 
design element. Here’s how to slip stitch a ridged seam:
 
1. Position the 2 pieces together with right sides facing (for a wrong side 
seam) or wrong sides together (for a right side seam).
 
 Make sure the stitches across each edge match.
 
2. Working through the double thickness of both pieces and using the 
same size crochet hook that you used in the design, insert your hook 
through the back 2 loops of the first 2 stitches, leaving a yarn tail 
about 6 inches long.
 
 Figure 15-12 shows the correct positioning of the hook in the back loops.
 
Figure 15-12: 
Slip stitch-
ing pieces 
together.
 
 
3. Yarn over the hook (yo).
 
4. Pull the yarn through and repeat Steps 2 and 3 in each stitch across; 
fasten off and weave in the ends.

 Take a look at the completed ridged seam in Figure 15-13 and refer to 
Chapter 5 for the how-to on weaving in ends.

Creating a flat seam
You can slip stitch two pieces together to create a flat seam, which crochet-
ers often use when they want the seam to be invisible (think of a side seam 
joining the front and back of a sweater). To slip stitch a seam in this fashion:
 
1. Lay the 2 pieces to be joined side by side on a flat surface, with right 
sides facing up (for a right side seam) or wrong sides facing up (for a 
wrong side seam).
 
 Check that the stitches across each edge match before moving on.
 
2. Working in the top loops of the stitches only and using the same size 
crochet hook you used in the design, insert your hook through the 
loops of the first 2 stitches, leaving a yarn tail several inches long.
 
 Figure 15-14 shows the correct positioning of the hook in the loops.

flat seam

stitching.

 Chapter 15: Connecting the Parts: Joining Seams
 
3. Yarn over the hook (yo).
 
4. Pull the yarn through the loops and repeat Steps 2 and 3 in each stitch 
across. Fasten off and weave in the ends as described in Chapter 5.
 
 Figure 15-15 shows you what a completed flat seam should look like.
 
Figure 15-15:

stitch seam.
 
Joining with single crochet
When you join two pieces with single crochet stitches, you create a sturdy 
seam that’s more flexible than one created with slip stitches. A seam made 
with single crochet creates a raised ridge that looks like a decorative chain. If 
you work it in a matching or contrasting color, it can become an integral part 
of your design.
 
Using single crochet stitches to join the seam in a garment has both positive 
and negative sides. When used for a strictly functional purpose (to join pieces 
together), the single crochet seam can cause uncomfortable lumpiness if it’s on 
the inside of the finished piece. However, used on the right, or outside of the 
work, it can add wonderful texture and another design element to your creation.
Follow these steps to work a seam using single crochet stitches:
 
1. Position the pieces with the right sides (or wrong sides) together and 
match the stitches across each side edge.
 
2. Working through the double thickness of both pieces and using the 
same size crochet hook that you used when creating the design, 
insert your hook through the top 2 loops of the first 2 corresponding 
stitches.
 
 Figure 15-16 shows the correct positioning of the hook in the top loops.

3. Yarn over the hook (yo).
 
4. Pull the yarn through both stitches, as shown in Figure 15-16.
 
5. Yarn over and pull the yarn through the 2 loops on your hook.
 
6. Insert the hook through the top 2 loops of the next 2 corresponding 
stitches and then repeat Steps 3 through 5 in each stitch across.
 
7. Finish by fastening off and weaving in the ends with the yarn needle.

Joining with a row of stitches
Joining two pieces with another row of stitches creates a different look from 
the other seams presented earlier in this chapter. Instead of working through 
the double thickness of two crocheted pieces, you work back and forth 
between them, usually on the right side of the piece. The row between the 

285
 Chapter 15: Connecting the Parts: Joining Seams
two pieces can be as narrow as a single stitch, or it can be wide and lacy. You 
can use this joining method to connect motifs when making a shawl, to add 
interest to the side seams of a garment, or to join panels when crocheting an 
afghan.
To crochet a joining row that’s a chain-2 space wide:
 
1. Lay the pieces side by side on a flat surface, matching stitches across 
the adjacent edges that you’re going to join.
 
2. Insert your hook under the top 2 loops in the designated stitch on the 
first piece, chain 1 (ch 1), single crochet (sc) in the same stitch, and 
then chain 2 stitches for the joining row.
 
3. Insert your hook under the top 2 loops of the designated correspond-
ing stitch on the second piece, yarn over (yo), and pull the yarn 
through the stitch. (Refer to Figure 15-18.)
 
Figure 15-18:

4. Yarn over, draw the yarn through the 2 loops on your hook, and 
single crochet the stitch complete.
 
5. Chain 2, insert your hook under the top 2 loops of the designated 
stitch on the first piece, yarn over, and pull the yarn through the 
stitch.
 
6. Yarn over and draw the yarn through the 2 loops on your hook.
 
7. Chain 2; then repeat Steps 3 through 6 across the row to the ending 
point designated in the pattern.

Joining on the last row or round
Some pieces, like the motifs we cover in Chapter 14, are joined together while 
working the last row or round. Joining pieces as you go saves you from the 
daunting task of having to sew or crochet lots (and lots!) of pieces together at 
the end of a project.
 
Because motifs use an endless variety of stitch patterns, not all of them are 
joined in the same spot, but some general guidelines do exist:
Crocheting seamlessly
If you think seams are pretty unappealing look-
ing in sweaters, or if you just hate making them, 
we bet you’ll be delighted to know that there 
are several interesting and attractive sweater 
styles you can create with few, if any, seams. 
Here are some ideas:
 ✓ Search out a pattern for a raglan-style 
sweater. You can work this style of sweater 
without a single seam from the neck down, 
all in one piece.
 ✓ Work a cardigan in one piece across the 
fronts and the back to the armholes; then 
work the fronts and backs off of the body. 
The only sewing you have to do is the 
shoulder seams.
 ✓ Work the sleeves of a sweater in rounds 
and directly off of the armholes, thus elimi-
nating the underarm and shoulder seams.
 ✓ Trim cuffs and bottom edges in post double 
crochet ribbing right off of the edges of 
the sweater (see Chapter 17 for more on 
ribbing).

287
 Chapter 15: Connecting the Parts: Joining Seams
 
✓ Motifs that have side edges, like squares or triangles, are usually joined 
along one or more sides.
 
✓ Motifs with points (think flowers and stars) are joined at one or more 
points.
Note: The pattern you’re working should let you know exactly where to place 
your joining stitches. If for some reason it doesn’t, then you’re working with a 
poor pattern.
Following are the general steps for joining on the last round of a granny 
square motif. (You can get even more practice with this technique by giving 
the Granny Square Cuff project at the end of this chapter a shot.)
 
1. Work the first granny square completely and fasten off.
 
 Head to Chapter 14 for instructions on creating the granny square motif.
 
2. Work the next square until you reach the point where you want to 
join the 2 pieces together.
 
 This point is usually a corner stitch or chain space.
 
3. Work the corner stitch or chain for the square you’re currently on, as 
described in Chapter 14.
 
4. Holding the 2 pieces with wrong sides together, insert your hook from 
the back of the current square into the same corner stitch or space of 
the square you completed in Step 1.
 
5. Yarn over and draw your hook through the corner stitch, or space, 
and the stitch on your hook, as shown in Figure 15-20.
 
 You now have a slip stitch seam at the corner.
 
Figure 15-20: 
Joining 
pieces on 
the last 
round.
 
 
6. Continue working the stitches across the side of the square, joining 
stitches or spaces as directed.

288
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
 
7. Finish the square you’re working on to the end of the round and 
fasten off; weave in any loose ends using a yarn needle.
 
 Continue working any remaining motifs the same way. To see what 2 
pieces joined together on the last round look like, see Figure 15-21.
 
If you’re working a row of squares, like for a scarf, you have to join squares 
on only one side. If you’re working a blanket or a shawl, however, you need 
to join the pieces together on more than one side. Blanket and shawl designs 
often consist of several rows containing a number of motifs that must be 
joined, which is why you join them on more than one side.

two pieces

Granny Square Cuff Project
This simple cuff (shown in the color section) is the perfect project to get 
you started with joining motifs as you go, which means you don’t have to do 
any seaming at the end. This project uses crochet thread that’s easy to find 
in most yarn and craft stores (see Chapter 2 for more info). Crochet thread 
is available in a variety of colors and fibers, so you can make a cuff for any 
occasion. Use a metallic thread to add bling for a night on the town or try a 
natural-colored cotton for a summer outing. Quick to stitch, you’ll want to 
make one of these cuffs for you and all of your girlfriends.

First granny square motif
Follow the directions in Chapter 14 to make 2 rounds of a basic granny 
square. Fasten off.
Remaining granny square motifs
Rnd 1: Work the first round like you did for the first granny square motif.
Rnd 2: Sl st across to first ch-2 sp, ch 3 (counts as first dc), work (2 dc, ch 
2, 3 dc) all in same ch-2 sp, ch 1, work (3 dc, ch 2, 3 dc) in next ch-2 sp, ch 1, 
work 3 dc in next ch-2 sp, ch 1, holding both pieces with WS together sl st in 
corresponding corner of completed square, work 3 dc in same ch-2 sp of the 
current square, sl st in next ch-1 sp of completed square, work 3 dc in next 
ch-2 sp of current square, sl st in next corresponding corner of completed 
square, ch 1, work 3 dc in same ch-2 sp of current square, ch 1, sl st in top of 
turning chain to join. Fasten off.
Repeat these steps for a third and fourth motif forming a single row of motifs.
Edging
With RS facing you, join thread to ch-2 sp at the upper-right corner of 1 short 
end of the cuff, ch 1, work 3 sc in same ch-2 sp, sc in each dc and ch-1 sp 
across the short end of the cuff, * work 3 sc in next corner ch-2 sp, working 
across the long end of the cuff to the next corner ch-2 sp, work 1 sc in each 
(dc, ch-1 sp, and sl st that joins motifs together) *, work 3 sc in next corner 
ch-2 sp, sc in next 2 dc, ch 6 for button loop, skip next (dc, ch-1 sp, and dc), 
sc in next 2 dc; rep from * to * once, sl st in first sc to join. Fasten off. Weave 
in any loose ends using the yarn needle.
Finishing
Place the cuff in a bowl or sandwich baggie. Pour equal parts water and 
fabric stiffener (just enough to cover the cuff completely) into the bowl or 
baggie. Allow the cuff to become completely saturated before removing it 
from the mixture and dabbing it with paper towels to remove any excess stiff-
ener. Lay the cuff on a piece of parchment paper, straighten it, open up the 
lacy stitches, and allow it to dry completely.
Assembly
Using the button loop as a guide, sew the button to the opposite side of the 
cuff with the yarn needle.

oes the idea of crocheting a sweater make you break out in a sweat? 
There’s really no need to be nervous, we promise. Although crocheting 
a sweater may seem like a daunting task, it’s really quite easy. Many sweater 
designs are nothing more than squares sewn together. The simple shaping 
involved in these designs is as easy as increasing or decreasing a few stitches 
in the designated places. (Chapter 7 gives you step-by-step directions for 
increasing and decreasing.) Of course, you’ll want to take a few points into 
consideration before you dig in.
First off, you want to choose a design that you like and that suits your phy-
sique. And if you’re new to the craft, you also need to consider the difficulty 
of the pattern. You want to choose your materials carefully, too, picking a 
yarn that’s easy to work with so you don’t become frustrated and give up 
before you finish.
This chapter shows you various sweater styles and how to construct them. 
You also see how sweaters are sized so you can adjust patterns to suit your 
needs. And at the end of the chapter, we give you instructions for a simple 
sweater that you can crochet in no time flat.

292
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
Choosing Stitches and 
Yarn for Your Sweater
To guarantee your first sweater attempt isn’t your last, choose your stitch 
pattern and yarn carefully. You can crochet beautiful sweaters with simple 
stitch patterns and readily available yarns. The sections that follow give you 
a heads-up on what to keep in mind.
Making the right pattern choice
First and foremost, make sure the pattern you’re considering isn’t too com-
plicated for your skill level before you buy it or any of the materials. (Refer 
to Chapter 4 if you need help reading patterns.) Here are some factors to 
consider:
 
✓ If you want a sweater design that has an open, lacy pattern, try a pattern 
that uses yarn (it’s easier to work with than the cotton thread many lacy 
patterns call for) and a simple stitch repeat.
 
✓ If you want to crochet a sweater with more than one color, choose a pat-
tern that has stripes or many different-colored motifs (see Chapter 14 
for more on motifs). Crocheting a pattern with color changes through-
out is much more difficult than working a sweater in simple stripes or 
motifs. Another option is to use a multicolored or variegated yarn, both 
of which give you color variation without you having to worry about 
changing yarn colors constantly (see Chapter 2 for info on substituting 
yarns).
 
✓ As a newbie, you want to avoid a pattern that calls for crocheting with 
two strands of yarn held together as one. Working with more than one 
strand of yarn can be confusing.
 
✓ For your first sweater, find a pattern that suggests a smooth yarn, such 
as wool or a wool blend, or a synthetic yarn, such as acrylic. These 
yarns are easier to work with than highly textured novelty yarns, such 
as bouclé or eyelash yarn. (Flip to Chapter 2 for details on the various 
types of yarn.) The extra tufts on some novelty yarns make for a bumpy 
crochet experience, and if you happen to make a mistake and have to 
tear out some stitches, you may end up tearing out your hair as well.
 
✓ Choose a pattern that you like, or else be prepared to lose interest 
within the first ten minutes.

293
 Chapter 16: Design 101: Crocheting Your First Sweater
 
If you’re brave enough to go ahead and buy a pattern with new stitches, be 
sure to work a practice swatch to get a feel for them before beginning your 
sweater.
Finding the right yarn
Choosing the right yarn to work with means more than just picking your 
favorite color. You also need to select a yarn that complements the pattern 
and yet won’t tie you up in knots while you’re crocheting with it. Of course, 
the pattern usually recommends a yarn so you have a ballpark idea of the 
yarn weight you need, such as sport weight or worsted weight, and the yarn 
material, such as acrylic or wool blend. (Head to Chapter 2 for the full details 
on yarn weights and materials.)
Keep in mind the following factors when you go yarn shopping:
 
✓ Feel: For a softer sweater, choose a lighter-weight yarn or a pattern with 
looser stitches. Although some of the bulky-weight yarns are relatively 
light, crocheting with the heavier weights of yarn quite often produces 
a stiff sweater that feels a bit like a cardboard box — definitely not an 
attractive (or comfortable!) option.
 
✓ Fiber content: Generally, natural fibers make for a more attractive and 
comfortable garment; however, they can be expensive and may require 
hand washing or dry cleaning. For your first sweater, blends (yarns that 
contain natural fibers along with synthetic fibers) and acrylic yarns may 
be more practical and easier to work with. Don’t forget to check the 
label to see whether the blend is machine washable.
 
 Mixing materials can lead to disastrous results when you wash your 
sweater, so if a pattern calls for two or more yarn types or colors, be 
sure to compare the care instructions on the yarn labels. Always choose 
yarns with the same laundering requirements.
 
✓ Twist: Use yarns with a nice twist to the strand; yarns without much 
twist have a tendency to split while you’re crocheting.
 
✓ Quantity: When buying yarn for a project, be sure to purchase enough 
for the entire project. The materials list at the beginning of the pattern 
specifies the amount you need in order to complete the design. If you 
run out, you may not be able to find the color you need in the same dye 
lot (yarn dyed in the same batch), which means you may end up with an 
unplanned two-tone sweater.
 
✓ Quality: Don’t skimp on materials. You get what you pay for, and after 
all your hard work, you want a sweater that retains its beauty for years 
to come.

294
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
Selecting a Super Sweater Style
You work most sweater designs in separate pieces — the back, the front (or 
fronts for a cardigan), the sleeves, and any desired borders — and sew or 
crochet them together after you complete them. (See Chapter 15 for how to 
join pieces of crochet.) How you make these pieces and put them together 
determines the sweater’s style. The simpler styles have little or no shaping 
to the pieces, but more complicated designs may have shaping or decreasing 
around the armholes and at the neck. The next sections show you several 
basic sweater designs you may want to consider.
 
For your first sweater, choose a pattern with simple shaping. Most sweater 
patterns include a schematic — a diagram of the sweater construction. The 
schematic includes the important measurements, such as the width of the 
back and front(s), the armhole depth (the size of the opening that you put your 
arms through), the sleeve length, and the finished back length.
Baring your arms: Sleeveless sweaters
The simplest sleeveless sweater styles have two panels that you join at the 
center back and center front, producing a V-neck with a small overhang at the 
shoulders (see Figure 16-1a). You can make a shell, one of the other sleeveless 
styles, by merely skipping stitches at the side seams to make armholes and 
skipping across the center to make the neck opening (see Figure 16-1b).
 
Figure 16-1:

V-neck and 
(b) simple 
shell.

With only minor shaping at the armholes and around the neck, you can make 
a simple tank top like the one in Figure 16-2a. The classic sleeveless vest car-
digan (shown in Figure 16-2b) usually requires a bit more shaping at the arm-
holes and neck, but you can still make it with relative ease.

Going the classic route: Pullovers
You can make a pullover with almost any combination of sleeve and neck 
styles. Figure 16-3 shows you one of the simplest combinations. It has drop 
shoulders, wide cuffs, and a boat neck without borders or ribbing to compli-
cate the design. A long sweater with no ribbing at the bottom is a tunic style, 
and a short sweater is sometimes called a crop top.
 
Figure 16-3: 
A pullover 
with no 
shaping.
 
Sweaters with tapered sleeves and some shaping at the neck are more 
common. Both sweaters in Figure 16-4 have tapered sleeves. (Tapered 
sleeves are easier than they look. You either start at the cuff edge and 
increase on each side until the sleeves reach the desired circumference or 
you start at the top edge and decrease until you get to the cuff.) The crew-
neck sweater in Figure 16-4a has no armhole shaping and subsequently has 
dropped shoulders; the V-neck sweater in Figure 16-4b has inset sleeves for a 
more tailored look.

296
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
Frequently, ribbing or borders edge the bottom, cuffs, and neck opening 
of a pullover-style sweater. (Check out Chapter 17 for more on ribbing and 
borders.)

The cap-sleeve pullover style is fitted to the shape of the body and produces 
less bulk under the arms. The upper sleeve edge is shaped in a curve to fit 
into the shaped armholes. The cap-sleeve sweater in Figure 16-5a sports a 
scoop neck and fold-down collar. You usually work the raglan-sleeve style 
shown in Figure 16-5b in one piece, starting at the neck and increasing at the 
“seam” point between the sleeves and the body of the sweater as you work 
down. This style has the advantage of having few, if any, seams to sew.

Buttoning up: Cardigans
Cardigans can have tapered sleeves or straight sleeves, inset sleeves or 
dropped shoulders, scooped necks, V-necks or boat necks, just like pull-
overs. The only difference is that cardigans have two fronts, so you sew the 
front to the back a little differently. Figure 16-6 shows a V-neck cardigan and a 
hooded cardigan, both with tapered sleeves.

Getting visually interesting: 
Motifs and vertical rows
Motifs and vertical rows are two fairly common design methods that can 
create a sweater with a lot of visual interest without you having to learn a 
bunch of complex stitch patterns:
 
✓ Motifs are small crocheted pieces worked in rounds that you sew or cro-
chet together (see Figure 16-7a). You can use square, hexagonal, round, 
or triangular motifs of almost any size, providing that all the parts add 
up to the sweater measurements. Flip to Chapter 14 for more on motifs.
 
✓ You can also crochet a one-piece sweater in vertical rows (see Figure 
16-7b) by starting at one cuff edge, working to the shoulder, and then 
increasing for the length of the body of the sweater in the front and the 
back. Even though it seems a bit more complex, this technique is great 
for making a flattering sweater.

Part IV: Putting It All Together 
Sizing Up the Sweater Situation
When is a small not a small? When your sweater pattern lists it as a medium — 
and it may do just that. So far, no industry sizing standard exists, so you need 
to look carefully to determine your size when picking out a pattern. As if that 
weren’t enough, each type of sweater (see the several styles covered in the 
previous sections) will fit your body differently. One size may be right if you 
want a snug sweater, but that same size may be all wrong if you’re setting out 
to crochet a sweater so baggy it could hold you and a friend. Even if you can’t 
find the perfect pattern, you may be able to alter the next best thing to get 
what you want. The following sections show you how to read sweater pattern 
sizes, determine the right size for you, and adjust your pattern accordingly.
Understanding sweater pattern sizes
Most sweater patterns list the size ranges (and one pattern may include sev-
eral sizes) at the beginning of the instructions. You may find the back length 
and sleeve length listed as well. In fact, you may even find a schematic dia-
gram showing the measurements of all the different pieces.
Sweater patterns also include the instructions for making all the listed sizes. 
Typically patterns list the directions for the smallest size first, followed by 
changes for the larger sizes in parentheses. For example:
Sc in each of next 50 (54, 58) sts.
Think flatter, not fatter
Before you buy a pattern, consider the style of 
the sweater that you hope to crochet. Does it 
flatter you, or does it make you look like a pump-
kin? Vertical lines can make you look thinner, 
but the construction of the sweater also affects 
how it looks on you. For example, dropped 
shoulders can look rather sloppy, but inset 
sleeves look tailored. 
The length of the sweater is important to con-
sider, too. Not everyone is cut out to wear a 
crop top. A sweater with ribbing that tends to 
cut you across the waist may be ideal for a thin, 
tall shape; a long tunic style, on the other hand, 
has a streamlining effect on a fuller figure. A 
boat neck can take away the look of sloped 
shoulders, and if you have narrow shoulders, 
wearing a cap sleeve with a slight puff can beef 
them up.

299
 Chapter 16: Design 101: Crocheting Your First Sweater
In this example, you work 50 single crochet stitches if you’re making a small 
sweater, 54 single crochet stitches for a medium one, and 58 single crochet 
stitches for a large one.
 
To make a particular sweater pattern easier to follow, highlight all the num-
bers for your desired size before you begin.
Figuring out fit
Choosing the right sweater size depends on the kind of fit you want. Some 
sweater styles are specifically designed to be loose fitting, but others are sup-
posed to be snug. So if you normally wear a medium top, don’t assume that 
the medium in the sweater pattern is automatically the fit you want.
 
The best way to ensure a great-fitting sweater is to first decide what fit you 
want: body hugging, close fitting, normal fitting, loose fitting, or oversized. 
Then forget what the pattern labels as small or large, measure your own bust 
line, and add to or subtract from the resulting measurement to get your 
desired fit. Table 16-1 tells you how many inches to add to (or subtract from) 
your own bust measurement to come up with a finished bust measurement 
that achieves the fit you desire. (The finished bust measurement is the total 
number of inches around the bust of the finished sweater — which isn’t neces-
sarily the same as your own bust measurement.) You then take this adjusted 
bust measurement and find the pattern size that matches it.

For example, if you have a 36-inch bust and want to make a normal-fitting 
sweater, add 2 to 4 inches to your bust measurement for a total finished bust 
measurement of 38 to 40 inches. Now look at the pattern for the finished bust

Part IV: Putting It All Together 
measurement closest to this range. If you don’t find an exact measurement, 
choose the next largest size for a comfortable fit. Usually patterns offer sizes 
in 4-inch increments. However, that’s not always the case. You may have a 
pattern that offers the bust sizes of 36 inches, 41 inches, and 46 inches. In 
this case, the 41-inch size is your best choice for a comfortable fit.
 
Working to the designated gauge is especially important when making 
sweaters. The gauge determines how many stitches you use for a given 
finished bust size. If your gauge is off, then your finished garment will be as 
well. The sweater that’s supposed to have a 38-inch finished bust measure-
ment may very well end up being a 34 if your gauge is too tight, or a 42 if it’s 
too loose. (Check out Chapter 3 for gauge basics.)
Customizing your pattern
If you find a sweater that you want to make, but it doesn’t have directions for 
your size, you may be able to alter it on your own. These sections show you 
how to get the size you need.
Adjusting the finished bust measurement
For sweaters that you work in horizontal rows, adjusting the bust size is 
fairly simple; you just add inches to (or subtract them from) the front and 
back pieces evenly. Suppose that the pattern for a cardigan offers finished 
bust measurements of 36, 40, and 44 inches, but you need a 48-inch finished 
bust. To get the extra 4 inches you need, adjust the directions for the larg-
est size by adding 2 inches to the back width and 1 inch to each of the two 
front pieces (or 2 inches to the front width if you’re working the front as one 
piece). You work the armholes and the length in the same manner as in the 
size-44 pattern.
Now check the gauge (refer to Chapter 3) for the pattern stitch and calculate 
approximately how many extra stitches you need to add to the back and the 
front to get your extra 4 inches. For example, if the pattern has just 1 stitch, 
such as single crochet, and the gauge is 9 stitches = 2 inches, you need to add 
approximately 9 stitches to the back width and approximately 5 stitches to 
each front piece of the cardigan.
But if you have a stitch pattern that repeats across the body of the sweater, 
you need to increase your stitch count in multiples of the stitch repeat. For 
example, if the pattern for the body of the sweater is * (double crochet, chain 
1, double crochet) in next stitch, skip next 2 stitches *, then the multiple (or 
repeated part of the pattern) is 3 stitches. So any adjusting you do must be in 

301
 Chapter 16: Design 101: Crocheting Your First Sweater
a multiple of 3 stitches. For the back, you can easily add 9 stitches, which is 
a multiple of 3 stitches. But for the front, 5 stitches isn’t divisible by 3, so you 
need to add the next multiple of 3, which is 6 stitches.
 
Sometimes you can make a good guesstimate from the existing multisized pat-
tern. For example, if the differences between small and medium and between 
medium and large are both four stitches, then you can usually assume that the 
difference between a large and an extra-large is also four stitches. The benefit 
of this approach is that the pattern designer has (theoretically) already fig-
ured out the multiple sizes in relation to the repeats.
 
For patterns with large repeats, adjusting the size and maintaining the original 
pattern isn’t always possible. Sometimes changing to a larger crochet hook 
and working the largest size offered creates a sweater that’s a size larger. 
Crochet a gauge swatch (see Chapter 3) with the next largest hook size and 
calculate how big the sweater would be if you used that hook size. If the result 
isn’t large enough, try the next largest hook. Make sure the looser gauge pro-
duces a comfortable fabric that isn’t too sloppy looking or so holey that you 
can see through it.
Lengthening the sweater and sleeves
If you want to adjust the sweater or sleeve length, you can usually just 
increase or reduce the number of rows you work:
 
✓ Adjust the length of the sweater by adding or deleting rows at the 
bottom edge (so you don’t mess up the shaping around the arm holes).
 
✓ Alter the sleeve length either above or below the shaping, depending on 
how it’s made. Just make sure you’ve added all the stitches to ensure a 
comfortable fit around the upper arm and shoulder.
Simple Sweater Project
The pullover design in this simple sweater (pictured in the color section) 
has minimal shaping and only a few simple stitches, but it creates a beautiful 
garment that you can wear for years to come. It features drop shoulders and 
a crew neck finished with simple rounds of single crochet. The yarn for this 
pattern is a heavy worsted-weight wool blend that allows you to crochet the 
sweater in a relatively short amount of time.

Assembly
With the right sides of the front and back facing each other, take a yarn 
needle and yarn and follow these steps:
 
1. Using the whipstitch, sew front to back across the shoulders.
 
 Check out Chapter 15 for all things sewing related.
 
2. With the right side of the fabric facing in, fold the sleeves in half 
lengthwise.
 
3. Matching the center fold to the shoulder seam, sew each sleeve in 
place using the whipstitch.
 
4. Beginning at the lower edge of the right side of the sweater, match 
stitches across the side edges and sew side and underarm seams using 
the whipstitch.
 
5. Repeat Step 4 on the left side of the sweater.
Use the schematic in Figure 16-8 to check your finished pieces for accuracy 
in sizing.

You’ve conquered crochet and completed the body of a great new 
sweater or cardigan. But something’s missing. How are you going to 
keep those wide-open sleeves from dragging without a cuff? Or how is that 
cardigan going to keep you warm if you can’t fasten it shut? This chapter 
shows you how to make your new garments functional with important finish-
ing touches such as borders, cuffs, collars, buttonholes, and pockets. And the 
best part is that creating these finishing touches is easy. Try out the Girl’s 
Versatile Camisole project at the end of this chapter for a beautiful garment 
you can crochet for your favorite girl — as well as a little practice making rib-
bing, buttonholes, edgings, and pockets.
 
If you want to practice your buttonholes or collars before trying them in 
another pattern, grab a few of the practice swatches that you made when 
practicing new stitches and add a buttonhole or collar to them.
Adding Trims: Edgings, 
Borders, and Collars
If you’re thinking that you can make only the most basic of sweaters — two 
squares hung on your shoulders — forget it. The following sections show you 
how to add simple edgings, ribbed borders, and elegant collars that bring 
your projects to life without a lot of work.

308
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
Outlining your designs with edging
Crocheting a basic edging of one or two rows or rounds on the outer edges 
of a design can smooth out the rough spots and add a finished, professional 
look to your crocheted items. You can even add crocheted edgings to other 
materials. Here are a few options:
 
✓ Crochet a round of single crochet stitches around the bottom edge, neck 
edge, and cuffs of a sweater, especially one that you worked in a heavier-
weight yarn. (Flip to Chapter 5 for a refresher on single crochet.)
 
✓ When making a patchwork afghan or sweater, edge each panel or motif 
with a row of stitches (typically the slip stitch or single crochet is used 
to create a smoother edge for joining).
 
✓ Crochet decorative strips of some of the fancier stitches (such as shells, 
clusters, and chain loops) with cotton thread and sew these edgings 
on pillowcases, sheets, handkerchiefs, and towels — or down the seam 
of your jeans! (Chapters 10 and 11 describe a variety of fancy crochet 
stitches you can use.)
 
Although knowing how to do a simple edging on your own is helpful, any pat-
tern that includes an edging to finish off the design will tell you in detail how 
to complete it.
Bordering your masterpieces with ribbing
Borders can be quite elaborate and may consist of a number of rows or 
rounds that are a design unto themselves. If intricate borders tickle your 
fancy, check out a few of the many publications available to find dozens of 
complex border designs. (Head to the appendix for a list of some of the best 
publications.) In the next sections, however, we show you how to make two 
of the most common borders used on garments: single crochet ribbing and 
post stitch ribbing.
Single crochet ribbing
Single crochet ribbing is a long strip of very short vertical single crochet rows. 
Because these rib rows lay perpendicular to the rows in the body of the fin-
ished sweater, you normally make the ribbing first and then work the body of 
the sweater off the row-end stitches along the long edge of the rib.
 
Typically, you want the ribbing to cinch in a little around the bottom of the 
sweater and at the cuffs but still be flexible enough to stretch. You accomplish 
this by applying two techniques at the same time: 1) making the rib with a 
hook that’s one size smaller than the one you use for the rest of the sweater 
and 2) working in only the back loops of each single crochet stitch across the 

309
 Chapter 17: Finishing Functionally: Borders, Buttons, and Pockets
row. You can make a wider border by increasing the stitches in each row (or 
you can create a narrower border by simply working fewer stitches). A typical 
bottom rib is 1 to 3 inches wide, or about 4 to 10 stitches.
To make ribbing that’s approximately 2 inches wide using worsted-weight 
yarn and a size H-8 U.S. (5 mm) hook, follow these steps:
 
1. Chain 9 (ch 9).
 
2. Single crochet (sc) in the second chain from the hook and then single 
crochet in each chain across; turn.
 
 You now have 8 single crochet stitches.
 
3. Chain 1 and then single crochet in the back loop of each single cro-
chet across the row (like in Figure 17-1); turn.
 
Figure 17-1: 
Working 
single 
crochet 
ribbing.
 
 
4. Repeat Step 3 until the rib reaches your desired length.
 
 Typically, you make the rib an inch or two shorter than the width or 
diameter of the part of the sweater that you’re crocheting. For example, 
if you have a sweater cuff that’s 10 inches in diameter, you make the rib 
8 or 9 inches in diameter. The amount of “cinching in” that you want to 
achieve and the elasticity of the yarn you’re working with are determin-
ing factors in deciding the length of the rib strip.
Figure 17-2a illustrates how a standard single crochet ribbing should appear, 
and Figure 17-2b shows the stitch diagram.
You can add single crochet ribbing after you’ve crocheted the body of a 
sweater, but doing so takes more time (plus the appearance may not be as 
neat as if you worked the ribbing first). If the pattern you’re working asks you 
to do this, it’ll provide instructions.
 
Single crochet ribbing works better with some yarns than with others. For 
example, if the yarn you’re using is soft and has little elasticity, it may not be 
suitable for single crochet ribbing. Yarns with some type of wool in them are 
the most suitable for ribbing projects.

If your ribbing looks flat, try working with a smaller hook to tighten it up. As a 
last resort, you can tighten up your flat ribbing by weaving elastic thread in 
several places around the bottom rib of a sweater to cinch it in. If that doesn’t 
do the trick, you may want to opt for post stitch ribbing (described in the next 
section).
Post stitch ribbing
Post stitch ribbing (double crochet stitches worked around the posts of 
previous stitches) isn’t as elastic as single crochet ribbing, but it creates a 
more rounded style of ribbing that always maintains its ribbed appearance. 
Because you work post stitch ribbing in horizontal rows, you can either make 
the ribbing first and then work the body across the top edge of the ribbing or 
you can make the body first and then work the ribbing off the bottom edge of 
the garment (which is normally how you want to do it).
To fashion a typical post stitch ribbing across a sweater’s bottom edge:
 
1. Work 1 row of double crochet (dc) across the bottom edge and turn.
 
2. Chain 2 (ch 2).
 
 This counts as your first post stitch.
 
3. Work 1 front post double crochet (FPdc) around the post of the next 
double crochet, as shown in Figure 17-3a.
 
 See Chapter 11 for detailed information on working post stitches.
 
4. Work 1 back post double crochet (BPdc) around the post of the next 
double crochet. (Refer to Figure 17-3b.)
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until you reach the last stitch.
 
6. Work 1 half double crochet (hdc) in the last stitch; turn.

Here’s how to work the next row:
 
1. Chain 2 (ch 2) for your first post stitch.
 
2. If the next post stitch from the previous row is raised to the front, 
work 1 front post double crochet (FPdc) around its post. If the next 
post stitch is raised to the back, work 1 back post double crochet 
(BPdc) around its post.
 
 In Figure 17-4a, the stitches that appear to be raised to the front are 
front post stitches.
 
3. Repeat Step 2 across the row until you reach the last stitch.
 
4. Work 1 half double crochet (hdc) in the last stitch and then turn.
 
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 until the rib measures the desired depth.

stitch diagram.

Part IV: Putting It All Together 
 
When creating post stitch ribbing, always make sure your post stitches are 
raised to the same side in each successive row or round. Keep an eye on 
the ribs and remember this: If the stitch you’re working is raised to the 
front, work a front post stitch; if the stitch is raised to the back, work a 
back post stitch.
 
Post stitch ribbing is much thicker and tighter than single crochet ribbing. 
Consequently, it can be pretty stiff and inflexible if you’re using a heavier yarn. 
Using a larger crochet hook gets you a softer, more flexible feel.
Gracing your neck with a common collar
Collars are a broad subject, with variations too numerous to explain in detail. 
However, if you can work basic crochet stitches (like the ones we describe in 
Chapters 5 and 6), you can fashion almost any style collar you can think of. 
Among the myriad collar options are soft, draping shawl collars, stiff mandarin-
style collars, turtlenecks, and the traditional flared collar. (If you need to 
create another type of collar as part of a pattern, the pattern instructions will 
tell you how.)
A common collar is the traditional flared collar, which features pointed ends 
like a standard shirt collar. This collar often appears on cardigans, crew neck 
pullovers, and polo-style sweaters with front openings and plackets. To work 
a flared collar, follow these steps:
 
1. With the right side of the sweater facing you, join the yarn with a slip 
stitch (sl st) in the top right-hand corner of the right front neck edge. 
Chain 1 (ch 1).
 
2. Single crochet (sc) evenly from the right front neck edge around to the 
top left-hand corner stitch of the left front neck edge; turn.
 
3. Chain 1 and then work 2 single crochet stitches (sc) in the first single 
crochet stitch. Single crochet in each stitch across, ending with 2 
single crochets in the last stitch; turn.
 
 Work the extra stitch at both edges of the collar to add the flare to it.
 
4. Repeat Step 3 until the collar reaches 3 inches deep, or your desired 
depth.
 
 To figure out how deep your collar should be, try measuring the collar 
on one of your favorite shirts or sweaters.
 
5. Fasten off at the end of the last row.

Holding Things Together: Buttonholes, 
Ties, and Drawstrings
When you button up your shirt in the morning, do you ever stop to think 
about which side the buttons are on and which side the holes are on? Or 
about how much space is between them? How about the ties on that cute 
new coverup? Are they flat or round? Do they have tassels or beads at the 
end, or are they just finished with a knot? The following sections show you 
all you need to know to keep your new clothes on — with buttons, ties, and 
drawstrings, that is.
Making room for buttons: Buttonholes
The design of the garment you’re crocheting determines whether you work 
buttonholes horizontally or vertically, although both appear as vertical slits 
when finished.
 
✓ If the garment has front plackets (those narrow bands that run up the 
inside edges of the front or back of a shirt or sweater opening), you 
create the buttonhole horizontally, right into the placket.
 
✓ If the design doesn’t have front plackets, you work buttonholes verti-
cally into the garment itself.
 
On a woman’s shirt, the buttonholes are on the right side of the shirt when 
you’re wearing it; on a man’s shirt, the buttonholes are on the left.
Of course, you can’t have buttonholes without buttons. Check out Chapter 
18 for info on making your own buttons. But in the meantime, take a look at 
the next few sections to see just how you can whip up some buttonholes. 
We also show you how to make button loops, which can be a pretty alterna-
tive to buttonholes.
Working buttonholes in front plackets
Making buttonholes in front plackets is easy. All you do is skip enough 
stitches in the designated row of the placket to accommodate the button 
size wherever you want a buttonhole. The buttonhole is usually created in 
a row close to the center of the placket, with a row or two following to add 
strength. To see how this technique is used, check out the Girl’s Versatile 
Camisole project at the end of this chapter.

Part IV: Putting It All Together 
Here’s how to fashion a standard buttonhole using this method:
 
1. Place markers across the front edge of the placket to mark the begin-
ning and end of each desired buttonhole position.
 
2. Crochet across the row in the stitch designated by the pattern to the 
first marker, chain 2 (ch 2), skip the next 2 stitches, and then continue 
crocheting across to the next marker. (Refer to Figure 17-5a.)
 
 If you have a larger button, chain the required number of stitches for 
that button size. Then skip the same number of stitches as you made 
chain stitches.
 
Figure 17-5: 
Working a 
buttonhole 
horizontally.

3. Repeat Step 2 for each marker until you reach the end of the row; 
turn.
 
4. Crochet evenly across the previous row, working an equal number of 
stitches into the chain space as it has chain stitches.
 
 In this example, you work 2 stitches into the space because you made 2 
chain stitches in the previous row. Refer to Figure 17-5b to see the com-
pleted buttonhole.
 
The number of stitches you skip, and therefore chain, depends on the size of 
the buttons you’re using. Have your buttons on hand before crocheting any 
buttonholes — that way you can better fit the hole to the button.
Working buttonholes in the garment body
If your sweater design doesn’t have front plackets, you work a buttonhole 
right into the body of the sweater by first working across the row to the point 
where the buttonhole will appear and then turning your work, leaving several 
stitches unworked. Next, you fasten off and rejoin the yarn in the stitch on 
the other side of the buttonhole, skipping a stitch to create the buttonhole. 

315
 Chapter 17: Finishing Functionally: Borders, Buttons, and Pockets
You then work in the few stitches that you left unworked in previous rows 
to create the other side of the buttonhole. What all of this means is that you 
need to plan ahead and determine your buttonhole positions before you 
work the body of your sweater.
Here’s how to crochet a vertical buttonhole (like the one illustrated in 
Figure 17-6b) on a single crochet sweater:
 
1. When you’re ready to begin the designated row for the bottom of the 
buttonhole, chain 1 (ch 1) to start the new row. Single crochet (sc) 
in each of the first 3 stitches and then turn, leaving the remaining 
stitches of the row unworked.
 
2. Chain 1 and then single crochet in each stitch across the first half of 
the buttonhole; turn.
 
3. Repeat Step 2.
 
 Figure 17-6a shows what your buttonhole should look like after you com-
plete this step.
 
Figure 17-6: 
Working a 
buttonhole 
vertically.
 a
b
 
4. Fasten off the yarn and, with the right side facing you, skip 1 single 
crochet and rejoin the yarn on the other side to begin making the 
second side of the buttonhole.
 
 
Rejoin the yarn so that you work in the same direction as the other side; 
otherwise you end up with a different stitch pattern. For example, if you 
work the first row of the buttonhole row with the right side of the proj-
ect facing you, make sure that when you rejoin your yarn to work the 
second side, the right side of your work is once again facing you.

316
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
 
5. Chain 1 and single crochet in each stitch across the remainder of the 
front; turn.
 
6. Work 3 more rows of single crochet across, ending with a wrong side 
row at the top of the buttonhole.
 
7. Chain 1, skip the space for the buttonhole, and single crochet in each 
of the next 3 single crochets on the first side of the buttonhole. (Refer 
to Figure 17-6b.)
Repeat Steps 1 through 7 for each buttonhole.
Working button loops
Button loops are nice alternatives to buttonholes. You can use them in a 
lightweight garment where you don’t need a tight closure to the front or as a 
simple one-button closure at the top of a neckline. You work these loops into 
the final rows of an edging of a garment, and the number of rows depends on 
the weight of your yarn:
 
✓ If you’re using a lightweight yarn, work the loop in the last two rows to 
give it more strength.
 
✓ If you’re using a heavier yarn, a loop worked in the last row is sufficient.
Here’s how to make a button loop on the last two rows of an edging:
 
1. On the next-to-last row of the edging, mark positions across the front 
edge where you want the beginning of your loops to be positioned.
 
2. Crochet in the specified pattern stitch across the row until you reach a 
marked position.
 
3. Make a chain that’s just long enough to form a loop that the button 
can slip through.
 
4. Without skipping any stitches, continue crocheting until you reach the 
marker for the next loop.
 
5. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 across the row; turn.
 
6. For the last row, crochet evenly across, working the same number of 
stitches as there were chains in the chain space of each loop.
 
 Check out Figure 17-7 to see a sample single crochet button loop.
 
When you’re working the button loop stitches, you can also work each stitch 
into the chain stitch itself. However, most patterns tell you where to place 
your stitches for the button loop.

317
 Chapter 17: Finishing Functionally: Borders, Buttons, and Pockets
 
Figure 17-7: 
A completed 
button loop 
worked in 
the last two 
rows of 
edging.
 
To make a button loop on the last row of an edging, proceed as follows:
 
1. Before you begin the last row, mark positions where you want to place 
your loops across the front edge, marking both the beginning and 
ending of each loop.
 
2. Crochet in the specified pattern stitch across the row until you reach 
the second marker for the first loop (as shown in Figure 17-8a); turn.
 
3. Make a chain that’s large enough to slip the button through.
 
4. Join the chain with a slip stitch (sl st) at the edge of the first marker of 
the first loop; turn.
 
 Refer to Figure 17-8b for a visual of this step; note that the work shown 
hasn’t been turned yet.
 
5. To complete the button loop, work the same number of stitches as 
there were chain stitches into the chain space.
 
 Figure 17-9 shows a completed button loop. To create additional button 
loops, repeat Steps 2 through 5 for each loop.

Keeping your clothes on (or just spicing 
them up): Ties and drawstrings
Ties and drawstrings make fun and easy closures for the front (or back) of a 
garment. They can be as simple as a single tie attached to each side of a light 
sweater’s front or as elaborate as a threaded drawstring criss-crossing the 
back of a summer halter top.
You usually attach ties to the top-front portion of a garment, close to the neck 
opening, or at the beginning of the front neck shaping, centered over the chest. 
However, you can also place ties in a row down the entire front of a sweater. 
You attach ties to garments with the excess lengths of yarn left from the begin-
ning of the tie to “tie” them to the correct position on the garment.
Drawstrings, which you weave through a round with eyelets (a round created 
with a pattern of spaces) or post stitches (see Chapter 11) crocheted into 
the body of a sweater or sleeve, often adorn the neckline, waistline, bottom 
edges, and cuff edges of some sweaters. You can also place drawstrings in 
the center-back area of a garment, weaving them back and forth between 
the open edges of, say, a halter top to draw the sides together. The Girl’s 
Versatile Camisole project, at the end of this chapter, gives you practice cre-
ating a drawstring and then weaving it through a round of post stitches that 
act as belt loops.
 
The following list gives you a few options for crocheting a tie or drawstring:
 
✓ Make a simple chain. Chain the required length for the tie or the draw-
string. (You may use one or more strands of yarn.) Note that this is how 
we made the drawstring in the Girl’s Versatile Camisole project.
 
✓ Make a round cord. Chain 5 (or the required number for the thickness of 
the cord) and slip stitch in the first chain to join. Single crochet in each 

319
 Chapter 17: Finishing Functionally: Borders, Buttons, and Pockets
chain around. Then, working in a spiral, continue to single crochet in each 
single crochet around until the cord reaches your desired length.
 
✓ Single crochet or slip stitch a cord. Chain the required length, turn, and 
slip stitch or single crochet in the back bump loop of each chain across.
To spice up your ties and drawstrings, add embellishments such as tassels 
(see Chapter 18) or just tie each end in a simple knot.
Purely Pockets
If you’re like most people, you enjoy having a place to stuff everything from 
pens and lip balm to your hands. Pockets to the rescue! The sections that 
follow briefly describe three common types of pockets — patch, slashed, and 
inseam (see Figure 17-10) — and give you the basics on how to add them to a 
garment.
 
Figure 17-10: 
Three 
classic 
pocket 
styles.
 
Patch pockets
Slashed pockets
Inseam pockets
Patch pockets: Tacked onto the front
Patch pockets are by far the simplest form of pocket to create. You simply 
crochet two squares or rectangles, usually in the same stitch pattern as the 
body of the sweater, and then whipstitch them onto the front of a garment, 
usually closer to the side seams than to the front edge, as you can see in 
Figure 17-10. (Chapter 15 has tips on sewing crocheted pieces together.) 
To see how a patch pocket might be used, check out the Girl’s Versatile 
Camisole project at the end of this chapter.

320
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
 
If your sweater features a contrasting color of yarn for the ribbing, you can 
outline the tops of your pockets with an edging in the same color for a cre-
ative and colorful touch.
Slashed pockets: Slotted in the front
A slashed pocket is similar to a patch pocket in shape and position. However, 
instead of sewing the pocket to the outside of the garment, you make a lining, 
generally in single crochet, and then attach the pocket to the wrong side (the 
inside) of the front.
 
A little more planning is involved in creating slashed pockets because when 
you’re crocheting the front, you have to allow for the opening. Your pattern 
will tell you exactly how to form and attach the pocket, but the general idea 
goes like this: You work the first row above the pocket opening across the top 
of the pocket lining (which you’ve already crocheted) and then skip the appro-
priate number of stitches across the front of the sweater to create the opening. 
Your lining is now attached to the body of the garment. Using the whipstitch, 
sew the lining to the wrong side of the garment around three sides directly 
below the opening (see Figure 17-10). For a decorative touch, crochet the top 
edge of the pocket opening on the front of the garment in a contrasting color.
Inseam pockets: Positioned at your 
sides for ultimate convenience
Inseam pockets are openings in the side seams of a garment, as you can see 
in Figure 17-10. To create inseam pockets, you first need to crochet a solid 
fabric pocket. That means you have three layers of crochet at the point 
where you place the pockets, a fact you should keep in mind if you’re work-
ing with a heavier-weight yarn because crocheted fabric tends to be thick.
 
Crochet inseam pockets with a lighter-weight yarn that matches your sweater 
and a smaller hook to reduce bulk.
To create a double-sided pocket to be sewn into an inseam:
 
1. Chain (ch) the number of chain stitches needed to create the width of 
the pocket.
 
2. Single crochet (sc) in the second chain from the hook and then single 
crochet in each chain across; turn.
 
3. Chain 1 and then single crochet in each single crochet across.

321
 Chapter 17: Finishing Functionally: Borders, Buttons, and Pockets
 
4. Repeat Step 3 until your pocket reaches the desired depth.
 
5. Fasten off the yarn.
 
6. Repeat Steps 1 through 5 to create the second side of the pocket.
After you make both sides of a pocket and sew them along three sides using 
the whipstitch, either sew or crochet the pocket into the side seam of the 
garment. Join one side of the pocket opening to the front side seam and the 
other side of the pocket opening to the back side seam. Close the rest of the 
side seam however the pattern instructs you to.
Girl’s Versatile Camisole Project
You don’t have to be an expert or be able to crochet numerous fancy stitches 
to create a garment that you’ll love to give as a gift to your favorite little girl. 
This project lets you create a darling camisole while practicing simple skills, 
including a patch pocket with a ribbed border, delicate picot edging, but-
tonholes, and a drawstring tie. The real beauty of this camisole is that it’s 
extremely versatile. Your favorite girl can wear it solo in the summer, or she 
can layer a T-shirt under it in the winter (as shown in the color section).
The mercerized cotton yarn recommended for this project comes in many 
vibrant colors and has a beautiful drape that’s perfect for crochet. The stitch 
pattern is a simple alternating repeat of two basic stitches, single crochet and 
double crochet, that adds a slight texture to the fabric yet keeps the stitches 
close together to reduce gaps.

Directions
Begin by crocheting the front and back portions of the upper bodice in one 
piece from the upper waist to the underarms. Then divide your work into 
front and back sections by skipping stitches and working stitches together 
to create the separation between the front and back of the camisole and the 
armholes. Working off the foundation of the upper bodice, you complete the 
camisole by working from the top down through the lower waist.

 Chapter 17: Finishing Functionally: Borders, Buttons, and Pockets
Do you recall seeing two sets of measurements in the Measurements bullet 
of the earlier “Materials and vital statistics” section? The smaller set of 
measurements represents the actual chest size of the person wearing the 
camisole. The bigger set of measurements indicates the finished size of the 
camisole itself. There’s a difference of 2 inches, which allows the wearer a 
little extra room for comfort or for layering the camisole over a shirt.
 
To help you keep track of which size you’re working on, read through the 
whole pattern before you begin and circle or highlight the size you’re making. 
Then you’ll never have to worry about losing your place.

Assembly
With the yarn needle and the right sides together, slip stitch the front straps to 
the back straps across the shoulders. (Refer to Chapter 15 for specific point-
ers on joining with the slip stitch.) Note: The straps are easily adjustable. If the 
person tries it on and the straps are too long or too short, simply unravel the 
slip stitch seam and adjust the number of rows until they’re perfect.
Finishing
All that’s left to do is to add a few rows along the back right and left edges for 
the buttonholes and buttons, edge the armholes and neck, rib and create a 
pocket, and add a drawstring.
Buttonhole placket
Row 1: With RS facing, join yarn at lower right-hand corner of back left.

W
hat is it about your favorite pieces of clothing that strikes your fancy? 
The color? The style? Perhaps a special finishing touch? This chapter 
shows you how to create those special touches that can turn a so-so piece 
into one that everybody raves about — from fringes and tassels to buttons 
and embroidery. The best part is that creating these finishing touches is very 
easy. So let your creative side run free!
Hanging Off the Edge: 
Fringe and Tassels
Fringe and tassels, which are the focus of the following sections, are two of 
the most common crochet embellishments. Fringe often complements a scarf 
or afghan, and tassels sometimes finish off drawstrings or ties on a sweater, 
the top of a hat, or a filet crochet wall hanging. (See Chapter 13 for the scoop 
on filet crochet.) Simple to make, fringe and tassels don’t require any addi-
tional materials other than the yarn and hook you use to crochet your piece. 
We explain how to make them in the next sections.
 
To spice up your look, you can interchange fringe and tassels (meaning that if 
a design calls for fringe at the ends of the piece, you can add tassels instead if 
you prefer the way they look). You can also add beads to individual strands or 
even fray the yarn by separating the fibers in a strand to create a fuller, fluffier 
appearance.

330
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
Tying a piece together with fringe
Fringe commonly borders the short edges of a scarf or the ends of an afghan. 
It gives a nice finishing touch and also hides those sometimes unsightly end 
rows. If your design incorporates several colors, you can tie them all together 
with fringe. Fringe looks best when it’s fluffy and full, so depending on the 
type of yarn you use, combine several strands for each fringe or just use 
whatever number’s in your pattern instructions. To make fringe, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Cut the yarn into the required number of equal lengths.
 
 For example, if each fringe has 3 strands of yarn and you have 20 
stitches across the edge that you’re attaching the fringe to, then you 
need 60 lengths of yarn, all equal in length.
 
 Cut the yarn twice as long as you want the final fringe to be because 
you’re going to fold the yarn in half. In fact, err on the safe side and cut 
it even a little longer to account for the knot. You can always cut the 
fringe shorter when you’re finished, but you can’t make it longer. 
(Fortunately, patterns usually tell you what the length of each fringe 
should be.)
 
2. Fold the strands of yarn for 1 fringe in half, forming a loop at one end 
and matching the cut ends of the yarn at the other end.
 
3. Working from the right side of the fabric, take your hook and draw 
the loop through the stitch that you’re attaching the fringe to, as 
shown in Figure 18-1a.
 
4. Draw the loose ends of the yarn through the loop, as in Figure 18-1b.

5. Holding the top of the fringe in one hand, pull gently on the fringe 
ends with your other hand to tighten the knot.
 
6. To finish, trim the ends of the fringe so they’re even.
 
 Tada! You’ve just completed 1 single-knot fringe. (It should look like the 
one in Figure 18-2.)

Tacking on tassels
You generally use tassels to embellish spots like the points on a shawl, the 
back of a hat, the ends of drawstrings or ties, or the lower edges of a wall 
hanging. Instead of working tassels directly in a stitch, as you do with fringe, 
you usually make them separately and then tie them to the design. Here’s 
how to make a tassel:
 
1. Cut a piece of cardboard the same width as your desired tassel length.
 
 If you’re following a pattern, refer to the instructions to see what size to 
cut the cardboard.
 
2. Wrap the yarn around the piece of cardboard several times.
 
 The more times you wrap, the fuller your tassel will be.
 
3. Tie the yarn bundle together at one end with a separate length of yarn 
(see Figure 18-3).
 
 This separate length of yarn should be at least 6 inches in length, long 
enough to tie the bundle together and then tie the tassel to the piece 
when complete. (Note: Some pattern instructions may give you an exact 
length to use. If they do, go with that instead.)

4. Slide the bundle of yarn off the cardboard piece.
 
5. Wrap another length of yarn 2 or 3 times around the bundle, approxi-
mately 1 inch below the tied end, and tie in a knot to secure (refer to 
Figure 18-4).
 
6. Cut the loops on the opposite end of the bundle from the tied end.
 
7. Trim the ends of the tassel so they’re even.
 
8. With the top tie’s remaining yarn, tie the tassel to the designated spot 
or stitch and make a knot.

 Attaching a tassel is the same no matter what you’re attaching it to. If 
it’s the back point on a bandana, then the stitch on the very end holds 
the knot. If you’re attaching tassels across the edges of a scarf, then the 
instructions designate which stitches to tie them to (for example, every 
other stitch or every third stitch).
Adding Special Touches with 
Buttons and Embroidery
If you want to embellish your crochet fabric a little bit (and with minimal 
fuss), you have an endless array of options. For example:
 
✓ Spice up an otherwise plain cardigan with some pretty buttons.
 
✓ Add a splash of embroidery to a piece worked in the square stitches of 
Tunisian crochet (see Chapter 12 for more on this technique).
The following sections show you how to apply these embellishment tech-
niques to your pieces.
Attaching unique buttons
If you just can’t find the perfect buttons, try making your own by working 
stitches over a plastic ring. Plastic rings are available in a wide variety of 
sizes, and you can use them to make buttons with the same yarn that you’re 
using for your design.
 
Crocheting over a ring is similar to working into a center ring or an adjust-
able ring (refer to Chapter 8 for the how-to on making a center or adjustable 
ring): Instead of inserting your hook into a stitch, you draw your yarn 
through the center of the ring, thereby working your stitch around the ring. 
Single or double crochet stitches are best for this. The yarn may be thick 
enough to fill in the ring with just one round, but sometimes you need to 
make additional stitches to fill in the hole, which you then draw together and 
close at the top.

Easing into elegant embroidery
What’s not to love about embroidery? Using a needle and thread (or yarn) 
on the surface of a crocheted fabric gives you the freedom to create unique 
designs that embellish your work of art. Many relatively plain pieces of cro-
chet are transformed by this method. You can transfer almost any embroi-
dery design onto a piece of crocheted fabric, whether that’s the front of a 
sweater, the panels of an afghan, or a crocheted background design. Crewel 
(embroidery created with yarn rather than thread) and cross-stitch work 
especially well on crocheting.
 
✓ Creating crewel work: Traditionally, crewel requires fine wool yarn, but 
over the years, it has become a style of embroidery that’s worked with 
any type of yarn rather than thread. The designs are varied and numer-
ous; basically any design you can embroider with thread can be embroi-
dered with yarn. Crewel works especially well on plackets, collars, and 
cuffs, or for creating a large picture on the front or back of a sweater, 
pillow, or handbag. You can work free-flowing designs in crewel, so let 
your imagination go. It’s a wonderful way to use up all that scrap yarn 
you have floating around. Check out your local craft store for some fun 
crewel designs.
 
✓ Enjoying cross-stitch: Adding cross-stitch to your crochet design is a 
perfect way to combine your efforts and show off your multitalented 
self. A Tunisian crochet design just screams to be cross-stitched on. 
The small squares that are integral to the design make transferring 
pretty much any cross-stitch pattern to the right side a snap. For more 
info on the Tunisian crochet and adding cross-stitch to a project, flip 
to Chapter 12.

I
t’s a fact: Even the most experienced crocheters make mistakes as they 
work. But fret not! In this chapter, we run through a few handy methods 
for fixing errors while you crochet. Of course, even after you’re finished 
with a piece, you may find that your work is still a little misshapen or that it 
doesn’t quite match the dimensions the pattern gave for the finished item. 
Don’t panic — your project just needs to be blocked, or pulled into shape 
with the help of a little water, heat, or starch. Blocking helps even out uneven 
stitches, square off corners, and make true circles out of rounds. In this chap-
ter, we also show you how to block your crocheted items and then how to 
launder and store them so they last forever (well, almost).
Troubleshooting Mistakes as You Crochet
No matter how much experience you have as a crocheter, you will make 
mistakes — and that’s perfectly okay! Sure, discovering that you’ve lost a 
stitch or made some other typical error can be a frustrating experience, but 
knowing how to identify the problem and how to fix it will get you back on 
track in no time. In the sections that follow, we introduce you to a few of the 
most common crocheting problems. You discover why they happen, how to 
fix ’em, and how to keep ’em from happening again. Well, what are you wait-
ing for? The key to stress-free crocheting awaits!

336
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
You’re struggling to fit your 
hook into the stitches
Trust us. We know how easy it is to get frustrated when you’re struggling 
to slide your hook into stitches. Following are a couple reasons why your 
stitches may be too tight (along with a couple easy fixes):
 
✓ You’re pulling the working yarn too tight as you work. Try loosening 
up your tension by adjusting how you hold the yarn. (Head to Chapter 5 
for pointers on how to hold yarn properly.)
 
✓ The loop is sitting on the skinny end of the hook. Make sure that when 
you finish the stitch, the loop on the hook is on the fat portion of the 
hook, not near the hook part.
 
✓ The hook’s too small for the yarn you’re working with. By switching to 
a larger hook, you can make bigger stitches that are easier to work with. 
(Flip to Chapter 2 for the scoop on hook sizes.)
 
To keep from having too-tight stitches ever again, make sure you’re checking 
your gauge against the pattern before you begin to crochet. Taking the time to 
make a gauge swatch early on saves you serious time in the long run. Check 
out Chapter 3 for more on gauge.
The edges of the fabric are shrinking
You’re crocheting along when suddenly you realize that your work is getting 
skinnier — something it’s not supposed to do. This problem is a common 
one for those who are still getting the hang of crocheting. If your project is 
growing narrower as you work, then you probably lost one or more stitches 
somewhere along the way.
To fix this problem, count the number of stitches in the last row. If you’ve 
lost stitches, hold up the fabric and look for any spots where you may have 
skipped a stitch. If you can’t easily see where you began losing stitches, care-
fully pull out the last row and count the number of stitches in the next row. 
(To pull out a row, simply remove the yarn loop from your hook and then 
gently pull on the tail end of the yarn to unravel the stitches. Be careful not to 
pull too fast though, because you may end up pulling out more stitches than 
you need to.) Continue to pull rows out one by one, counting as you go, until 
you’re back to the correct number of stitches and then try, try again.
Alternatively, if you’ve lost just one or two stitches, you can simply add the 
same number of stitches to the next row by working two stitches in the same 
space until you’re back to the correct stitch count. When you’re done adding 
stitches, hold up your work to make sure the edges still look even.

337
 Chapter 19: Neatness Counts: Fixing, Blocking, and Caring for Your Work
 
Stitches are commonly lost at the beginning or end of a row because it’s hard 
to tell where the first or last stitch of the row is due to the fact that both are 
typically turning chains and therefore have a different appearance than a regu-
lar stitch. To help you distinguish where different rows start and end, place a 
removable stitch marker in the first and last stitch of a row. When you work 
your way back to the marker, you’ll know exactly where you need to place the 
stitch. (See Chapter 5 for more on turning chains.)
The edges of the fabric are getting wider
Occasionally you may find that the edges of your work are actually growing. 
If your work is getting wider and you didn’t intend for it to, that means you’ve 
unknowingly added stitches somewhere.
To trim your project back down to size, count the stitches in the last row to 
determine how many extra stitches you have. If you have more stitches than 
you’re supposed to, carefully pull out the last row (as explained in the pre-
ceding section) and count the number of stitches in the next row. Continue 
pulling rows out one by one, counting as you go, until you’re back to the cor-
rect number of stitches. Then you can start over safely.
What to do if you’ve only added one or two stitches? Just subtract the same 
number of stitches in the next row by working two stitches together until 
you’re back to the correct stitch count. After you’ve decreased the stitches, 
hold up your work to make sure the decrease isn’t noticeable. (See Chapter 7 
for the how-to on decreasing stitches.)
 
To keep from having to redo your work in the future, make sure to count your 
stitches after every row until you feel more confident in your crochet skills. 
And don’t forget that turning chains count as the first stitch in taller stitches; 
make sure to work into them at the end of a row. Refer to Chapters 5 and 6 for 
details on how to work into the turning chain.
The foundation edge is tighter 
than the rest of the fabric
If after working a few inches of your project you notice that the piece is get-
ting wider and you didn’t add any stitches, there’s a chance your foundation 
edge may be too tight. The chain stitch is easy to make narrower than the 
other, more structured stitches, so accidentally making the foundation chain 
too tight is quite common. To avoid this issue, try to keep your chain stitches 
loose as you work the foundation chain. To keep your stitches loose, you can 
either consciously make loose stitches by keeping your tension looser than 

338
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
you would for regular stitches or you can use a hook that’s one size larger than 
the one the pattern calls for. The resulting chain may look a little messy, but 
some of the slack will be taken up when you work the following row of stitches. 
(Keep in mind that your foundation chain should look like a big fat worm!)
The corners are curled
When the corners of your work are starting to curl and just won’t lie flat, you 
may need to try adjusting your tension. Stitches that are worked too tightly 
together result in a stiff fabric, which often causes the corners to curl in.
To fix this problem, try stretching the fabric. That just might loosen up the 
stitches and allow the piece to lie flat. If the corners begin to curl again, make 
sure you’re using the appropriately sized hook for the yarn you’re working 
with. Switching to a larger hook size will create bigger stitches and loosen up 
the fabric, allowing it to lie flat. If all else fails, you may need to adjust your 
tension by changing the way you hold the yarn. Flip to Chapter 5 for guidance 
on holding yarn the right way.
 
Sometimes you won’t realize that the corners of a project are curling until 
you’re all done with it. Instead of tossing your work away in a heap of frustra-
tion, try blocking it (using one of the processes we describe later in this chap-
ter). With some yarns, such as wool, blocking loosens up the fibers, allowing 
you to stretch out any curls.
One way to prevent curled corners is by simply loosening up your stitches. 
If you find that your hands are cramping up, chances are you’re holding the 
hook too tightly and therefore creating stitches that are too tight as well. 
Relax your grip for looser stitches.
 
Making a gauge swatch helps you identify and prevent any potential problems 
early on. If your swatch is curling, then your project will probably curl as well. 
Always make sure you’re working to the gauge specified in your pattern if you 
want to wind up with a successful project.
Blocking Your Way into Perfect Shape
To get most crocheted garments, such as sweaters, vests, and jackets, to 
match a pattern’s finished measurements, you must block them. Blocking is 
a process used to shape crocheted work. It can be as simple as spraying your 
design with water or completely immersing it in a tub to get it good and wet. Or 
you may use some heat by applying steam from your steam iron. Some items, 
such as cotton doilies or three-dimensional designs, need a little extra shaping 
help from starch or another stiffening agent.

339
 Chapter 19: Neatness Counts: Fixing, Blocking, and Caring for Your Work
The final use of your design helps you determine which method of block-
ing to use. Another consideration is your yarn type. Different types of yarn 
respond differently to water, steam, and heat, and using the wrong method 
can have disastrous results. But don’t be alarmed; the following sections help 
you avoid blocking-related pitfalls by giving you the scoop on the various 
blocking methods and when you use each one. Of course, before you begin 
any project, you need to make sure you have the right tools on hand, so we 
give you a quick list of these as well.
 
If your design has pieces that you join together, such as the sleeves and body 
of a sweater or the different motifs for an afghan, block each piece separately 
before joining. Doing so makes joining the pieces easier because each one is 
the correct size and shape. It also gives you a more accurate finished size.
 
If the design that you’re blocking is a garment and it doesn’t fit correctly 
before blocking (it’s too small or too large as is), don’t try to stretch it (or 
squash it) to fit when blocking. Blocking only shapes the garment; it doesn’t 
change its size. If you try to stretch (or squash) your garment during blocking, 
you may ruin it entirely. If your garment doesn’t fit, chalk it up to experience 
and pass it along to someone who can use it. Don’t despair if this happens; it’s 
all part of the experience of becoming a better crocheter.
The essential tools
You probably already have most of the tools you need to correctly block 
your designs. First, make sure you have the finished design dimensions from 
the pattern so you know what shape you’re shooting for. Second, find a flat, 
padded surface that’s large enough to accommodate your design when you 
stretch it to its finished measurements. (The surface must be padded so you 
can pin your piece down.) A bed, the floor, a large piece of sturdy cardboard 
covered in plastic wrap, an ironing board, or a mesh drying rack all work fine 
as a padded surface.
Here are some other tools you may need, depending on which blocking 
method you’re using:
 
✓ Large tub or sink
 
✓ Several large, absorbent towels
 
✓ Tape measure or ruler
 
✓ Rustproof straight pins (always pin out your crocheted designs with this 
kind of pin to prevent nasty rust stains)
 
✓ Spray bottle
 
✓ Thin cotton towels (two or three should suffice) or a pressing cloth (an 
old sheet or T-shirt works well)

340
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
 
✓ Steam iron
 
✓ Spray starch, liquid starch, or fabric stiffener (available at most craft 
stores)
Wet blocking
To wet block an item, you submerge the whole thing in water. This method 
works for just about any yarn, but read the yarn label just to be sure it’s 
not a dry-clean-only fiber. You can also gently wash your crocheted item at 
this time to rid it of the dirt and oils that the yarn is sure to have picked up 
from your hands. Use a mild soap made for delicate fabrics (not detergent) 
and rinse well in cool water before blocking. This method is useful for many 
items, including garments, afghans, and home décor.
 
If you’re not sure whether your yarn is colorfast, be sure to test a swatch 
before dunking your whole design into a tubful of water. Bleeding colors, espe-
cially in a striped design, can ruin your work. If you use a solid color, the effect 
of bleeding isn’t as bad, although you may encounter some fading if you con-
tinue to wash the piece over time.
To wet block your work, follow these seven simple steps:
 
1. Fill a clean, large tub or sink with cool water and immerse your cro-
cheted design completely, allowing it to become thoroughly wet.
 
 If you want to wash your design, now’s the time. Add some soap to the 
water and swish your garment around. Rinse it well with cool, clean 
water, taking care not to twist or wring out the fabric.
 
2. Drain the water from the tub or sink without removing your crochet 
project.
 
3. Press down on your work in the tub to remove some excess water and 
then pick it up and gently squeeze it to remove more water, being 
careful not to let any part of it hang down and stretch.
 
 Never wring your wet crocheted item. Doing so can cause friction 
between the fibers and alter the appearance of your design. More impor-
tantly, it can stretch the fibers beyond repair, and you could end up with 
a misshapen piece.
 
4. Lay your design flat on top of a large towel and then roll the towel 
and crocheted design together like a jellyroll to absorb more of the 
water.
 
 You don’t want to remove too much of the water — just enough so that 
the material isn’t soaking wet.

341
 Chapter 19: Neatness Counts: Fixing, Blocking, and Caring for Your Work
 
5. Place another large towel on your blocking surface and lay your work 
flat on it.
 
 Your blocking surface needs to be a place where you can leave your 
design undisturbed for a day or two because it may take that long to dry 
completely.
 
6. Following the schematic (garments) or measurements (afghans or 
other nonwearables) for the design, use a ruler or tape measure to 
gently shape and stretch the item to the correct size.
 
 If the design has three-dimensional elements to it, such as bobble 
stitches or popcorn stitches, gently puff them into shape. If the design is 
lacy, make sure to open up the loops so that the design is evident.
 
7. Allow your design to dry thoroughly.
 
 If you need to dry your work in a hurry, place a large fan in front of the 
damp design to speed up the drying process. Don’t place it so close that 
the fan can blow your masterpiece around, though.
 
 
Don’t ever use a blow-dryer to dry your design. The heat could shrink 
your piece or melt the fibers in a synthetic yarn.
Spray blocking
Spray blocking is similar to wet blocking, but instead of immersing the piece 
completely in water, you spray it with water to dampen the fabric. It’s kind 
of like spritzing your hair to spruce up your ’do when you don’t have time to 
wash it. Use spray blocking when your piece needs only a little bit of help to 
shape up or when you don’t want to take the time to wet block. Here’s how to 
spray block:
 
1. Prepare a blocking surface that’s suitable for pinning down your design.
 
 See the earlier “The essential tools” section for ideas of appropriate 
blocking surfaces.
 
2. Lay out your design on the blocking surface, stretching it to the cor-
rect measurements; with rustproof pins, pin it in place along the edges 
every few inches to make sure it stays put.
 
3. Grab a clean spray bottle filled with lukewarm water and spray the 
design evenly to a uniform dampness.
 
4. Gently smooth the fabric with your hands to even it out, shaping any 
three-dimensional stitches as needed.
 
5. Allow the design to dry completely before removing it from the block-
ing surface.

342
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
Heat blocking
You can heat block your design by either ironing it or steaming it. Faster than 
wet blocking and spray blocking, heat blocking works best on natural fibers, 
such as wool and cotton, but you must take extra care not to burn the fibers. 
The next sections fill you in on how to iron and steam your work.
 
We don’t recommend heat blocking for synthetic fibers because they can melt, 
thereby ruining your design.
Ironing it out
The ironing method of heat blocking works well for flat items, such as doilies, 
that have no three-dimensional stitches. To block your design with the ironing 
method:
 
1. Set your iron to the correct temperature as indicated on the yarn label.
 
 If the label doesn’t recommend a temperature, be cautious and set the 
iron on a medium-low setting (the steam function should be off as well). 
You can always make the iron warmer, but burns are irreversible.
 
2. Lay out your design on a heat-resistant blocking surface and pin it out 
to the proper dimensions.
 
3. Cover your crocheted design with a clean cotton towel or a pressing
cloth. Then, using a spray bottle, spray it with water to slightly dampen 
the cloth.
 
 If you prefer to dry press, cover the crocheted design with the cloth and 
omit the spraying step.
 
4. Iron the item through the cloth by gently pressing and then lifting 
the iron and moving it to a new section.
 
 Running the iron over the design while pressing down flattens your 
stitches and may harm the yarn fibers.
 
5. Allow your design to cool and then remove it from the blocking surface. 
If necessary, repeat the process on the other side.
Steaming your fabric’s pores
Steaming works especially well for correcting curling edges. It’s also quite 
useful when you have to shape just a small section, such as a cuff or collar that 
won’t behave. All you need to steam press your work is a normal steam iron, 
which you probably have in your laundry room. To steam block your design:
 
1. Set your iron to the correct temperature indicated on the yarn label.
 
 If the label doesn’t recommend a temperature, be cautious and set the 
iron on a medium-low setting.

343
 Chapter 19: Neatness Counts: Fixing, Blocking, and Caring for Your Work
 
2. Lay out your design on a heat-resistant blocking surface and pin it out 
to the proper dimensions.
 
3. Holding your steam iron about an inch above the fabric, steam sepa-
rate sections of the design, being careful not to let the iron touch the 
fabric.
 
4. Give your design time to cool and dry before removing it from the 
blocking surface.
Blocking with starch
Doilies, collars, ornaments, edgings, and three-dimensional designs often 
require a little extra help when blocking in order to show off the stitches 
and, in some cases, to create the proper shape. When your design calls for a 
stiffer finish, it’s time to call in the starch. Note: You use starch and stiffening 
agents almost exclusively with cotton thread.
For designs such as pillowcases or towel edgings, you want a lightly starched 
finish, or else your piece may become too scratchy to actually use. Doilies 
and filet crochet designs require a heavier finish, so use heavy spray starch 
or liquid starch in order to show off the stitch detail and maintain the proper 
shape. To permanently stiffen your works of art, such as ornamental snow-
flakes and other three-dimensional designs, a commercial fabric stiffener, 
which you can find at most craft stores, is in order.
The following sections cover the how-tos of working with spray starch, liquid 
starch, and fabric stiffeners.
Achieving targeted stiffness with spray starch
Spray starch is your ticket for a light- to medium-crisp finish. To block a 
crocheted item with spray starch, proceed as follows:
 
1. Hand wash the crocheted design with a mild soap and cool water, 
rinsing several times to remove all the soap residue.
 
 Make sure not to twist or wring out the design while rinsing it.
 
2. With a clean towel (or several, if you need them), blot out any excess 
moisture until the design is just damp.
 
3. Prepare a blocking surface suitable for pinning down your design.
 
 Not sure what constitutes a good blocking surface? See our recommen-
dations in the earlier “The essential tools” section.
 
4. Spray one side of your design with starch and place the starched side 
down on your blocking surface.

344
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
 
5. With rustproof pins, pin out your design to the required dimensions, 
taking extra care to shape stitch patterns as shown in the photo that 
accompanies your pattern.
 
 This could mean opening up the spaces in lace patterns or straightening 
out picot stitches.
 
 Work quickly so that you get the design pinned down before the starch 
dries.
 
6. Spray the other side of the design, making sure the fabric is lightly 
saturated.
 
7. Blot excess starch from the design with a clean, dry towel and allow it 
to dry completely.
Immersing your piece in liquid starch or fabric stiffener
Blocking a crocheted design with liquid starch allows you a bit more range 
when determining the desired crispness. Follow the manufacturer’s advice on 
the bottle of starch for the amount of starch you need and whether you need 
to dilute or not.
 
If your final design has a permanent shape, such as snowflake ornaments, 
baskets, or other three-dimensional designs, use a commercial fabric stiffener 
rather than liquid starch. Liquid starch loses its hold over time, whereas a 
commercial stiffener is meant to last. A design blocked with a commercial 
fabric stiffener should hold up for years to come with the proper care.
To block with liquid starch or fabric stiffener, follow these steps:
 
1. Using cool water, gently hand wash your design with a mild soap, 
rinsing several times to remove all the soap residue.
 
 Avoiding wringing out or twisting the fabric as you rinse it.
 
2. In a clean tub or sink, prepare the solution as directed on the 
container.
 
3. Immerse your crocheted item in the solution and allow it to penetrate 
the fabric.
 
 Your fabric should be soaked through with the solution in a couple 
minutes.
 
4. Prepare a blocking surface suitable for pinning down your design.
 
5. Remove the item from the solution and, with a clean, dry towel, blot 
your crocheted item to remove any extra solution.
 
6. With rustproof pins, pin out the design to the required dimensions 
on your blocking surface, taking extra care to shape stitch patterns as 
shown in the photos accompanying your pattern.

345
 Chapter 19: Neatness Counts: Fixing, Blocking, and Caring for Your Work
 
7. After pinning, blot the design again to remove any remaining excess 
solution.
 
 If you’re using commercial fabric stiffener, be extra careful to remove as 
much excess solution from the stitches and between the stitches as pos-
sible. When dry, the solution can leave a hard residue that obscures the 
design.
 
8. Allow your masterpiece to dry completely before removing the pins.
Shaping Three-Dimensional Designs 
with Household Items
Not all crochet is designed to be flat. One of the beautiful aspects of this craft 
is that with it you can create three-dimensional designs, whether your cre-
ation is as simple as a hat or as complex as a decorative, three-dimensional 
Lilliputian village that you work in many pieces.
Many three-dimensional designs need to be coaxed and shaped after you 
finish the actual crocheting, however. Most patterns include detailed instruc-
tions on how to finish and shape your work. If yours doesn’t, you can follow 
the wet-blocking instructions presented earlier in this chapter. (Note: The 
one change to the standard wet-blocking procedure in this case is that 
instead of pinning your design out flat, you mold it over the appropriate 
shape and pin down the edges so it can dry that way.)
Some of the supplies to have on hand when you’re shaping a three-
dimensional design are
 
✓ A kitchen bowl: Pick one in an appropriate size (comparable to the fin-
ished design measurements) for wet blocking a hat or shaping a doily 
into a decorative bowl.
 
✓ Paper cups: Shape cotton-thread Christmas ornaments, such as bells, 
with paper cups.
 
✓ Plastic wrap: Probably the most useful tool, plastic wrap can stuff, prop 
up, and shape many three-dimensional designs.
 
✓ Preformed foam shapes: Available in most craft stores, foam shapes, 
such as cones, can shape the bodies for objects such as crocheted 
Christmas tree toppers.
As you can see, you don’t need any fancy supplies. Just look around your 
house, and you’ll find that you already have many of the items you might 
need on hand.

Part IV: Putting It All Together 
From This Day Forward: 
Caring for Your Work
Most crocheters take great pride in their creations, but when all is said and 
done, caring for the finished design is often an afterthought. Considering the 
many hours you inevitably invest in making a crocheted design just right, 
taking the time to find out how best to care for your piece is worth your 
while. The following sections outline different methods for washing your fin-
ished work as well as the best way to store it afterward to avoid stretching 
and discoloring.
Scrub-a-dub-dub: Washing your work
As with all types of fabrics, you want to follow certain guidelines when wash-
ing your work. Different yarns have different needs, so be sure to check the 
yarn label for specific care instructions. You don’t want to throw a wool 
sweater into the washer and dryer, for example, unless you want to end up 
with a sweater for a doll. Hand washing, dry cleaning, and machine washing 
(all of which we cover in the next sections) all work well to get your clothes 
clean, but beware the fiber content of your yarn. As with tags on store-bought 
items, the yarn label tells you how to take care of your piece.
 
Most yarn labels use the International Fabric Care Symbols shown in Figure 
19-1 to tell you how to care for the yarn. Look for them and pay attention to 
them.

national

 Chapter 19: Neatness Counts: Fixing, Blocking, and Caring for Your Work
Hand washing
If your yarn of choice is washable, hand washing the item with gentle soap 
made for delicates (not detergent) is by far the best way to go because it 
preserves the integrity of the piece. Machine washing can be tough on fabric, 
and you don’t want to lose all of your hard work to modern conveniences.
Depending on the size of the item you’re washing, fill a clean sink or tub with 
cool to lukewarm water and add a small amount of soap. Wash your piece 
gently and then rinse it thoroughly. Squeeze it gently to remove excess water; 
blot it with soft, absorbent towels; and then lay it flat to dry, blocking it into 
shape using the original method you used to block it when you first com-
pleted it. (Remember: Any time your piece gets wet, it must be reshaped.)
 
If it’s practical, place your creation in a colander when rinsing it to avoid 
stretching the fibers.
Dry cleaning
If the yarn label says dry clean only, then dry clean your design. You can be 
sure that the manufacturers have a good reason for labeling the yarn dry 
clean only, the most likely one being that water damages the fibers. Take the 
item to your favorite dry cleaner along with the yarn label, if possible. Most 
dry cleaners are willing to take extra special care of an object if they know it’s 
handmade.
Machine washing and drying
 
Some yarns, especially acrylics, are suitable for machine washing and drying, 
although hand washing is always the safer route. Before dumping your piece 
in the washing machine, though, read the label for the correct temperature for 
both washing and drying and be sure to set the speed to the gentle cycle. The 
agitation in washing machines doesn’t make for happy yarn and can cause 
irreparable damage if it’s too rough.
Drying your item by laying it flat is always preferable but not always practi-
cal. If you must put your design in the dryer, make sure you dry it on the 
lowest heat setting.
Rest in peace, dear sweater: 
Storing your work
 
The most important rule to remember when putting your crocheted designs 
away is to never, never, never hang them. Hanging crocheted pieces stretches 
the stitches all out of shape. The design may even become unusable if it’s left 
hanging for any length of time.

348
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
Keep all of your work — whether that’s clothes, home décor items, or a mix 
of the two — in a cool, dry place, away from direct light. Ultraviolet light, 
excessive humidity, and extreme temperature changes all have adverse 
effects on yarn. Find a nice, quiet place and let your creations rest in peace 
until you’re ready for them again.
 
Store crocheted garments neatly folded in a drawer or on your closet shelf — 
likewise with tablecloths, bedspreads, and blankets. Smaller items that don’t 
need to be folded should be stored flat.
If your crocheted designs (such as holiday items) are going into storage for 
any length of time, invest in some acid-free tissue paper. Placing the paper 
between the folds and around items keeps the dust and dirt off and preserves 
the fibers. And always put your work away clean. Time allows stains to set in, 
and they may not come out a year later.

crochet and offers advice on how to make the most of 
your crochet experience. With our list of ten ways you can

Ten Ways to Do Good with Crochet
In This Chapter
▶ Giving the gift of crochet to your friends
▶ Crocheting for important causes
▶ Making green choices and repurposing your junk
You don’t have to be an expert in crochet to make a difference with it. The 
moment you found out how to guide your hook through the stitches you 
became empowered to make positive changes in the world. In this chapter, 
we highlight ten ways that you can do good things with crochet — for your 
friends, your community, and your planet.
Share Your Passion with 
a Crochet Basket
Give the gift of crochet by putting together a “Learn to Crochet” basket for 
a friend. Be sure to include all of the tools someone would need to start cro-
cheting right away: a book on how to crochet (why not this one?), an H-8 U.S. 
(5 mm) hook, some worsted-weight yarn, and a yarn needle. Make your basket 
extraspecial by including a coupon for a free one-on-one lesson with you.
Host a Stash Swap Party for Friends
Instead of buying new yarn, host a stash swap party with some of your fellow 
knitters and crocheters. Maybe you’ve bought some delicious yarn on sale but 
had no pattern in mind to go with it, or perhaps you just have a couple balls 
left over from a different project. A stash swap party allows you to go through 
your stash (a collection of yarn) and sort out the yarns that you haven’t been 
able to use. Everyone brings his or her contribution to the party, and you get 
to have fun trading yarn while bonding with your fellow stitchers.

352
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Teach Someone How to Crochet
Now that you know how to crochet, why keep it to yourself? Share your new 
hobby by teaching someone else. Even children as young as 6 years old can 
easily pick up on the basics of crochet. Start by showing your pupil how to 
make a chain that she can use as a hair tie, bracelet, or necklace, and then 
move on to basic squares that can be used as doll blankets or donated to a 
charity that makes blankets for the homeless (see the next section for more 
information).
 
For a complete manual on teaching children (and grown-ups) how to crochet, 
check out the Crochet Guild of America’s Web site at www.crochet.org.
Donate Crochet Supplies 
to Community Groups
If you find you have too much yarn or too many hooks, or if you just feel like 
sharing the crochet wealth, you can donate yarn, hooks, and other crochet 
supplies to one of many organizations (including schools and senior centers) 
looking for craft supplies. To find a group that will be happy to take your dona-
tion, check with your local crochet guild (see the appendix for details on find-
ing yours), senior center, or school district. You can also contact the Helping 
Hands Needle Arts Mentoring Program (www.needleartsmentoring.org), 
which creates community partnerships to promote and encourage the shar-
ing of needle arts with children.
Crochet for a Cause
You only need to know a few simple stitches to make a difference in the lives 
of others. Hundreds of nonprofit organizations have been created by caring 
people to collect handmade items in support of a good cause. From crocheted 
hats for hospitalized infants to blankets for homeless pets, there’s an organi-
zation for almost any project, and many of them provide simple patterns for 
you to follow.
 
To find an organization that interests you, contact your local crochet guild, 
hospital, shelter, or senior center, or try getting in touch with any of these 
established resources:

✓ Bev’s Country Cottage: This Web site (www.bevscountrycottage.
com) is a great resource for patterns, and it has links to charities from 
around the world.
 
✓ Stitches from the Heart: This charity organization collects hats, blan-
kets, and booties for premature infants born in hospitals across the 
United States. Check its Web site (www.stitchesfromtheheart.org) 
for patterns and tips on choosing appropriate yarn.
 
✓ Warm Up America!: This charity collects handmade blankets to give to 
shelters, children’s hospitals, nursing homes, and anyone in need. Its Web 
site (www.warmupamerica.org) has patterns and tips for making and 
joining squares. (Note: A similar organization exists in Canada. Check out 
the Blankets for Canada Society at www.blankets4canada.ca.)
Buy Local Yarn
You can lighten your impact on the planet by supporting the fiber-producing 
farms in your area. Some local farms even have community-supported 
agriculture (CSA) programs where you can invest directly in the farm and 
get lots of yarn or wool for spinning at the end of the season. For many city 
folks, investing in a yarn CSA is the next best thing to owning their own 
sheep. To find a fiber-producing farm in your area, check with your local yarn 
shop and farmers’ markets.
Use Eco-Friendly Fibers and 
Natural-Colored Yarn
 
Don’t be swayed by the first pretty color or texture of yarn that meets your 
eye. Instead, think about the planet as you make your yarn purchases and 
keep these important considerations in mind while you shop:
 
✓ Seek out yarns that are organically produced, environmentally 
friendly, or have companies behind them that support fair trade prac-
tices. By supporting eco-friendly companies you’re helping to promote 
a greener earth one stitch at a time. To find out which yarn brands 
are eco-friendly, check the label, ask your local yarn shop, search the 
Internet, or join eco-friendly groups on social networking sites such as 
Ravelry (www.ravelry.com).

354
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Purchase yarns that are naturally colored or made with low-impact 
dyes. Yarns come in a wide rainbow of colors. However, many of the dyes 
used to create those colors include harmful chemicals that are toxic to 
the environment. Using yarns that are naturally colored or made with 
low-impact dyes helps reduce mankind’s toll on the earth. Many yarn 
companies offer a range of natural-colored yarns; in fact, we bet you’ll be 
surprised at how many shades there are. Check the label or ask your local 
yarn shop to help you find out which yarns are naturally colored.
Crochet Green Items for Your Home
 
Make your home a little greener by trading in your disposable goods for reus-
able items. Here are just a couple ideas:
 
✓ Replace your paper towels with washable, crocheted towels. The 
Absorbent Hand Towel project in Chapter 12, made with Tunisian 
stitches, produces large, absorbent towels, but you can also use any of 
the stitches and stitch patterns found in this book to whip up your own 
towel designs. Just be sure to use a cotton yarn, because cotton tends to 
be the most absorbent fiber.
 
✓ Skip the paper and plastic bags for your own crocheted bag when 
shopping. The String Market Bag project in Chapter 13 leaves you with 
a handy bag to replace those plastic grocery bags that usually end up 
in the trash. Be sure to make a few bags to keep in your car or purse for 
those unexpected trips to the yarn shop.
Recycle Old Fabric with 
a Crocheted Rag Rug
Instead of tossing or donating old sheets and clothes, consider giving them 
a new purpose. Rag crochet involves tearing or cutting fabric into long strips 
and working with them in the same way you would with yarn. The only differ-
ence is that the fabric tends to be a little thicker, so there’s a bit of prep work 
involved. To find suitable rag material, check your closet for worn clothes 
and linens, or hit the secondhand store.
To get you started, here’s a pattern for a simple, small, round rag rug that’s 
suitable for a bathroom, child’s room, or entryway. To make this rug larger, 
just keep increasing each round by six stitches in the same pattern until the 
rug reaches the desired size. Check out a finished rag rug in Figure 20-1.

355
 Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Do Good with Crochet
 
Turning rags into rugs is an age-old tradition, but why stop at rugs? Take rag 
crochet in a whole new direction by making bags, pillows, or baskets.

Materials and vital statistics
 
✓ 4 clean and dry twin-size sheets, or 1 clean and dry twin-size sheet 
per color
 
✓ Hook: Crochet hook size P-15 U.S. (11.5 mm) or size needed to obtain 
gauge
 
✓ Scissors
 
✓ Ruler
 
✓ Measurements: 20 in. in diameter
 
✓ Gauge: First 5 rounds = 61⁄2 in. in diameter
 
✓ Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), slip stitch (sl st), single crochet (sc)
Directions
The directions here are suitable for light- to medium-weight fabrics, like the 
kind you’d find with most shirts and sheets. If you use a heavier-weight fabric, 
such as denim, wool, or terrycloth, you may need to switch up to a larger hook 
size. In any case, feel free to adjust the hook size so you can crochet the fabric 
strips comfortably.

356
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Preparing the strips
You can cut fabric into strips for crochet in several ways. The most basic way 
is to simply cut the fabric into equal-sized strips and then knot, sew, or loop 
them together into one long, continuous strand. If you’d prefer not to join the 
fabric strips, follow this method:
 
1. Beginning with the short end of a twin-size sheet facing you, make a 
cut 1 inch in from the longest edge of the sheet.
 
2. Cut or tear the fabric, maintaining about a 1-inch width down the 
length of the sheet until 1 inch of fabric remains at the end; then stop.
 
3. Working in the opposite direction, make a cut 1 inch over from the 
last cut edge. Cut or tear the fabric in about a 1-inch width back across 
the length of the sheet until 1 inch remains; stop.
 
4. Repeat Step 3 until you’ve made a zigzag cut of 1-inch wide strips 
across the width of the sheet (see Figure 20-2).
 
5. Starting at either the beginning or the end of your cut, wind the fabric 
strip in the same way you would a ball of yarn.
 
 Head to Chapter 2 for an explanation of how to wind a ball of yarn. And 
don’t worry about the corners at the end of each fabric strip. With rag 
rugs, corners and knots add character.
Repeat the preceding directions and wind each sheet into separate balls.

Making the rug
The directions for this rug are identical to the first 16 rounds of the Bucket 
Hat project at the end of Chapter 8 (see how the same stitch patterns can be 
used for a variety of designs?). Note: If you’re using different colors to make 
the rug, join a new color at the beginning of each round. (And if you’re having 
trouble reading the Crochetese, flip to Chapter 4 for help reading patterns.)
Center ring: Make an adjustable ring, ch 1.
Rnds 1–16: Follow the first 16 rnds of the Bucket Hat project at the end of 
Chapter 8.
Fasten off and weave in the loose ends with your hook.
Save the Planet One Crocheted 
Bag at a Time
In recent years, plastic bags have become a sort of environmental conun-
drum. Research has shown that although producing plastic grocery bags 
is more efficient than producing paper ones, the plastic bags are slower to 
degrade, filling landfills and posing a threat to wildlife and marine life. So, as 
more and more plastic grocery bags are being replaced by cloth totes, why 
not turn your leftover plastic bags into a reusable crocheted bag? Plastic 
bags can be crocheted like yarn; they just need a little bit of prep work to 
become plastic yarn, or plarn.
 
If you don’t have enough plastic bags to make the bag shown in Figure 20-3, 
ask around and help relieve your neighbors of their unwanted bags.
Materials and vital statistics
 
✓ 50 to 60 plastic grocery bags, cleaned and dried thoroughly
 
✓ Hook: Crochet hook size N-13 U.S. (9 mm) or size needed to crochet 
comfortably
 
✓ Scissors
 
✓ Ruler
 
✓ 4 stitch markers

Directions
The directions here are written in Crochetese. Refer to Chapter 4 for a 
refresher on how to read crochet patterns if you get stuck. Gauge isn’t crucial 
with this project, so feel free to adjust the hook size so you’re crocheting 
comfortably with the plastic yarn.
Preparing the strips
All you need to prepare your plastic grocery bag strips is a pair of long, sharp 
scissors and a trash bag for unwanted ends. Be warned, though, that cutting so 
many bags is a little time consuming. Why not alleviate the tediousness by cut-
ting bags and getting caught up with your favorite TV shows at the same time?
Follow these steps for cutting loops from plastic grocery bags:
 
1. Lay a plastic bag flat, fold it in half lengthwise so that the handles are 
at one end, and fold it in half lengthwise again.
 
2. Cut off the top and bottom of the bag, removing the handles and 
bottom seam.

359
 Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Do Good with Crochet
 
3. Cut the remainder of the bag in 11⁄2- to 2-inch pieces widthwise for the 
loops.
 
4. Repeat for the remaining plastic bags.
Joining the strips
Joining the plarn loops together may seem a little awkward at first, but you’ll 
have the rhythm down in no time. Just follow these simple steps to achieve 
the result shown in Figure 20-4:
 
1. Holding two loops, pull the end of one loop halfway through the open 
center of the other loop.
 
2. Continue to pull the end of the first loop through the opposite end of 
its own loop and pull to make a knot.
 
 At this point, the end of the second loop should be secured inside the 
knot.
 
3. Take another free loop and pull it halfway through the open center of 
one of the joined loops; continue to pull the end through the opposite 
end of its own loop and pull to make a knot.

Ten Variations on Crochet
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at variations in stitch technique
▶ Playing with tools to create special pieces
▶ Crocheting on fabric and other oddities
P
eople have experimented quite a bit with the art of crochet over the years. 
They’ve taken the basic stitches and found unique ways of manipulating 
them to create variations on the original art form. They’ve also combined the 
use of the crochet hook with other tools to produce totally new techniques. 
They’ve even experimented with a variety of materials to broaden the scope 
of the craft.
This chapter shows you ten of the many possibilities out there in the world 
of crochet, starting with four special stitch techniques, moving on to three 
techniques requiring special tools, and closing with three diverse materials 
you can use. Each of these variations demonstrates the versatility of a craft 
that has been evolving for centuries and will surely continue to grow and 
change as long as people have the drive to create. You may not want to 
tackle any of these crochet variations right now, but hey, it’s always good 
to have something to shoot for, right? If you do want to try your hand at any 
of these crochet variations, the resources in the appendix can point you to 
instructions.
Irish Crochet
Developed in the mid-19th century, Irish crochet (inspired by the popular 
Venetian laces of the time) is a stitch technique that combines floral and leaf 
motifs arranged on a board and then joined together with a network of mesh. 
It’s usually worked in fine cottons to produce the traditional delicate look, 
and often the pieces are padded by working over a cotton strand called a 
foundation cord.

362
Part V: The Part of Tens 
You can use Irish crochet (shown in Figure 21-1) to produce beautiful home 
décor items such as pillow toppers, bedspreads, curtains, and tablecloths — 
basically anything you’d normally crochet with cotton. Though not often 
worked these days, you can still find examples of gorgeous blouses, dresses, 
collars, and evening gowns worked in Irish crochet.
 
Figure 21-1: 
Sample 
of Irish 
crochet.
 
Free-Form Crochet
Free-form crochet, also known as scrumbling, is kind of like coloring outside 
the lines. Whereas most crochet patterns have you work a regular, sym-
metrical pattern in rows of uniform stitches or in neat, concentric circles, 
free-form crochet opens the door to a more random and artistic approach to 
the craft. Although patterns can be written for such pieces, the beauty of this 
technique is that you can use your own imagination and instincts to produce 
truly unique creations.
This stitch technique supports irregular stitch heights, curves, and zigzags; 
a mixture of highly textured areas with lightly textured ones; a combination 
of rounds with rows; and randomly shaped areas to create a patchwork look 
like that of the sample in Figure 21-2. Combining different colors and textures 
of yarns helps enhance the effect of free-form crochet.
 
Free-form crochet lends itself to unique fashions and accessories, abstract 
and pictorial wall hangings, and three-dimensional sculptures.

Surface Crochet
Surface crochet, which resembles embroidery, is crocheting (generally with yarn) 
onto a crocheted fabric background (see Figure 21-3). You work surface 
crochet just like a slip stitch (presented in Chapter 5) over the surface of the 
background. You can surface crochet in a straight line to add stripes to an 
otherwise solid piece or create pictures on your background. It’s frequently 
used to turn a horizontally striped piece into a plaid by adding the vertical 
lines afterward.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Tapestry Crochet
Popular in Africa and South America, tapestry crochet is a technique that’s 
gaining momentum throughout the crochet community. It’s generally worked 
in single crochet in charted, repetitive patterns that resemble woven tapes-
tries (see Figure 21-4). You can work tapestry crochet in rows to produce flat 
pieces or in rounds to produce three-dimensional objects.
 
Figure 21-4: 
Tapestry 
crochet 
sample.
 
What makes tapestry crochet different from standard single crochet is the 
practice of working in more than one color at a time, carrying the unused 
color under the current color, and working your stitches very tightly. You 
usually work tapestry crochet with a stiffer material, such as a sport-weight 
cotton, to produce the characteristic of a stiff tapestry.
 
This stitch technique is ideal for producing baskets, handbags, wall hangings, 
place mats, and hats. To make beautiful garments (such as scarves, shawls, 
and even sweaters) with tapestry crochet, work your stitches more loosely 
and with a soft yarn.
Broomstick Lace
Broomstick lace is a crochet technique that uses a large dowel or needle to 
form clusters of loops within a fabric. The loops form circles of yarn that 
produce a unique texture (see Figure 21-5) that’s suitable for afghans, shawls, 
and sweaters. This technique can also work with fine cotton to produce 
unusual lacy home décor items.

lace.
 
Hairpin Lace
Hairpin lace (see Figure 21-6 for a sample) is worked on a hairpin lace loom 
to produce long strips of lacy loops. The technique was originally worked on 
actual hairpins, which are much smaller, but has since evolved into a larger 
version that’s good for making lacy shawls and afghans.
 
Figure 21-6: 
Hairpin lace 
sample.
 
 
Hairpin lace looms are adjustable to different widths, so you can vary the 
laciness of your strips. You can also vary how the loops are joined together, 
allowing for a myriad of designs.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Double-Ended Crochet
Double-ended crochet (also known as cro-hooking) is similar to working Tunisian 
crochet (refer to Chapter 12 for more on this). The difference between the 
two techniques is the hook. Double-ended crochet uses a long, double-ended 
hook that allows you to work stitches on or off from either end.
This technique is usually used with two alternating colors, working loops 
onto the hook with one color and then turning the work around and work-
ing the stitches off with the second color. Double-ended crochet produces a 
fabric that’s reversible because it has a different color pattern on either side 
(as you can see in Figure 21-7). The fabric is softer and more elastic than the 
basic Tunisian stitch, making it ideal for afghans, scarves, and stoles.

Both sides 
of a double-
ended

sample.

Crocheting on Fabric
If you have a fabric whose edges won’t unravel, you can actually crochet an 
edging onto it with cotton thread. You can crochet edgings on pillowcases, 
tablecloths, or on a piece of linen to create a simple place mat. Working 
with heavier cotton or sport-weight yarn, you can also produce fashions 
and accessories with suede pieces, felt, or fleece. You can even use crochet 
to join pieces of fabric together to create jackets, bathrobes, totes, purses, 
vests, and skirts.

367
 Chapter 21: Ten Variations on Crochet
With lightweight fabrics, you can usually just poke through using a tiny hook. 
In fact, you may find linen pieces hemmed and equipped with small holes 
around the edges for the purpose of crocheting onto the fabric. With suede 
or heavier fabrics, you must poke or punch holes into the fabric at evenly 
spaced intervals and work the stitches into them.
Bead Crochet
Bead crochet has grown in popularity, perhaps thanks to the ever-expanding 
selection of beads available in craft stores. You can add beads to crochet in 
two basic ways:
 
✓ Sew them on after you finish crocheting. If you want only a few beads 
to highlight certain areas, sew them on after you’re done crocheting. If 
you’re using smaller beads, you can sew them on with a regular sewing 
needle and matching sewing thread (or clear nylon thread). However, if 
your beads are fairly large, you must use a yarn or tapestry needle and 
the yarn you used to crochet the piece.
 
✓ Crochet them right into the fabric. If the beads are an integral part of 
the design, you can easily crochet them in as you work. String the beads 
onto the yarn or thread with a needle and begin to crochet according to 
the pattern until you reach the first stitch or row where you want to add 
a bead. Then insert your hook into the next stitch, draw a bead up close 
to the hook, yarn over, draw the thread through the stitch, and then 
complete the stitch as you normally would. Figure 21-8 shows beaded 
double crochet stitches, with a row of regular (nonbeaded) single cro-
chet in between.
 
Figure 21-8: 
Beaded 
double 
crochet 
stitches.
 
 
Make sure that the weight of the yarn is compatible with the weight of the 
beads. If you’re using a lightweight yarn, don’t use heavy, oversized beads. 
The weight of the beads can cause the stitches to droop and pull, creating an 
unsightly mess. On the flip side, if you’re working with a heavier-weight yarn, 
choose beads that won’t get lost in the stitches.

368
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Wire Crochet
Crocheting with wire is a technique that goes hand-in-hand with free-form 
crochet (which we describe earlier in this chapter) to produce unique cro-
cheted art. Using soft wire and a relatively large hook, you can create beauti-
ful crocheted sculptures. Soft, colored wire is now readily available in most 
craft stores. With the addition of some fun and funky beads, you can crochet 
yourself a choker and matching bracelet.
 
Any of the basic crochet stitches will work for wire crochet except the 
Tunisian stitch. Whichever stitch you decide on, keep it simple because the 
materials used for wire crochet pose enough challenges on their own.
