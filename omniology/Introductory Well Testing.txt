Preface
1	 Preface
While there are many excellent and important books on the subject of well testing, few provide an 
introduction to the topic at the very basic level. The objective is to provide an easy to read introduction 
to classical well test theory. No previous knowledge in well testing is required. The reader is expected to 
understand basic concepts of flow in porous media. Well test interpretation depends on mathematical 
models. Some calculus skill is required. Hopefully, this book will give the reader a useful introduction 
to a fascinating subject and stimulate further studies.
Well testing is important in many disciplines: petroleum engineering, groundwater hydrology, geology 
and waste water disposal. The theory is the same, but different nomenclature and units are used. The 
present book use consistent units and petroleum engineering nomenclature. A consistent unit system 
leads to dimensionless constants in all equations. Equations in a consistent unit system are dimensional 
transparent but inconvenient numerically. Hence a myriad of practical unit systems have evolved. Many 
authors present equations first in consistent units and then convert them to the practical unit system of 
their choice. Conversion factors are easily available in the literature.

Introduction
2	 Introduction
Well testing may be regarded as part of formation evaluation. The objective of formation evaluation is 
to provide input to a geologic model, which in turn may provide important input data for an economic 
model. Decisions, whether to start possible engineering projects or not, are based on economic analysis.
Classical well test interpretation depends on simplified analytical models and graphical techniques. The 
methodology may be described as follows: A pressure test is conducted by giving the well at least one 
perturbation in flow rate. The pressure response (pressure signature) is measured and matched to a 
mathematical model (equation or graph). Each well has a unique response which depends on the rock 
and fluid properties. The matched model gives rise to equations that may be solved for selected variables. 
There is a limit as to how many parameters that can be determined this way. Hence, well test interpretation 
depends on input data from other sources. For example, many interpretation techniques depend on the 
appearance of straight lines. These show up for specific flow periods, like radial-, linear- and pseudo steady 
flow. It is possible to obtain two equations from a straight line. These can be solved for two unknowns 
only. It is possible to solve for a few more by type curve analysis. The additional information required 
derives from a variety of sources, such as: geology, core analysis, well logging, seismic, etc.
An alternative to classical well testing is numerical simulation. An analytical model gives insight into the 
interaction of the variables that a numerical model cannot give. On the other hand, an analytical model 
may be too simplistic due to restrictive simplifying assumptions. Both techniques are needed. The use 
of numerical models also falls outside the scope of these notes.

Introductory remarks
The productivity index of a well has been defined as the production rate pr. unit drawdown. This measure 
varies from well to well and should be as high as possible.
Usually a reservoir is produced by several wells. Each has a specific drainage area. A small reservoir may 
be produced by a single well. Then, the drainage area and the reservoir are the same. 
If the saturation of a fluid phase becomes less than a critical value, then it will no longer exist as a 
continuous phase. Such a fluid phase has lost the ability to move. The relative permeability becomes 
zero. We refer to a flowing phase as a mobile and a non-flowing one as immobile. Suppose there is one 
flowing phase only. The immobile phases are compressible and will add to the system compressibility. 
Use of the total compressibility, 
tc , will account for the immobile phases in an approximate way.

Pressure becomes independent of time provided the flow in and out of the drainage area are the same. 
Such flow is of steady state type. Then, the right hand side of the above partial differential equation is 
zero. The drainage area has an open external boundary as steady state flow depends on flow into the 
drainage area. The pressure at the outer boundary is constant, i.e. 
ep
const
=
. This can be achieved by 
a pressure maintenance project (water and or gas injection) or edge water drive.
No-flow boundaries may be due to geology or interference between production wells. Interference creates 
no-flow boundaries somewhere between the wells. A no-flow boundary is closed. From Darcy’s law we 
find that a no-flow boundary may be characterized by

Productivity of Wells
Both steady and pseudo-steady flow are characterized by a constant productivity index, PI. The important 
consequence is that the production rate, q, is proportional to the drawdown, Δp.

Both flow regimes are boundary dominated since they depend on the outer boundary condition. Also, 
both flow periods are preceded by an infinite-acting flow period. During the later period, the influence 
of the outer boundary condition is negligible.

Productivity of Wells
The size of drainage area is A and 
A
C is Dietz shape factor. Many shape factors for simple geometries 
have been tabulated. For example, 
A
C is 31.62, 30.88 and 27.6 for a circle, square and equilateral triangle 
respectively, and each area with the well located in the center.
It is convenient to define the drawdown in terms of average pressure for pseudo-steady flow. This is 
because p  may be estimated by material balance calculations. 
3.3

where the productivity index assume constant values. The above equation shows up as a straight line

Both steady state- and pseudo steady flow are ideal cases. A real case will fall somewhere in between.
A high production rate means more income. An increase in drawdown may be achieved by a change 
of choke. If the well is producing at full capacity, this possibility does not exist. In addition, too high 
drawdown may cause problems like sand-, water- and gas production, etc. Hence, the drawdown has 
an upper limit.
A high productivity index is advantageous (see Figure 1). Production characteristic “a” is obviously best 
since it gives the highest production rate for a given drawdown. The same production characteristic also 
gives the lowest drawdown for a given production rate.

Productivity of Wells
Figure 1: Effect of the productivity index on the production rate
By inspection of the above equations, we see that a well will produce at higher rate if it is possible to 
increase the numerator and decrease the denominator of the relevant productivity equation.
A high flow capacity, kh -product, is favorable for the production rate. It is difficult to change the flow 
capacity by an engineering technique.
The denominator may be decreased by:
• Reducing the skin factor, S. This can be done by a stimulation project, hydraulic fracturing 
or acid injection.
• Reducing the external radius, 
er , which can be achieved by infill drilling. The drainage area 
of each individual well is reduced since the reservoir area is shared by more wells.
• An increase in the wellbore radius, 
wr , which is expensive or even impossible for deep wells. 
• An increase in the effective wellbore radius,

• Decreasing the viscosity, μ. A thermal project.

Time dependency of the pseudo-steady solution
The time dependency can be explained by simple material balance model. A model may be classified 
according to the number of space variables. There are one-, two- and three dimensional models. Oldest 
is the tank model which has no space variable at all. As such, it may be classified as zero dimensional. 
The pressure associated with a tank model is the volumetric average pressure, p . The shape of the tank 
is arbitrary.
Consider a slightly compressible fluid with compressibility,

compressibility of the fluid is small and constant by assumption.

The pore volume of the drainage area is constant for a conventional reservoir. Then, the fluid volume, 
V, in the reservoir and the pore volume, 
p
V , remains the same regardless of pressure. Suppose the 
average pressure is decreased from the initial pressure, 
ip  to, p , and there is no flow into or out of

Flow efficiency
The productivity index depends on the unit system. Use of a normalized productivity index removes 
this inconvenience. In most cases, an actual well has some skin. We use the same well, but without skin, 
as reference condition. A well without skin has been called ideal. The Flow Efficiency, FE, is defined as:

Introductory remarks
The quality of a well may be quantified by comparison against the performance of an equivalent 
ideal one. A non-ideal condition may lead to either an improvement or a deterioration of the well 
performance. These conditions are called stimulation and damage respectively, and are characterized 
by a skin factor.
The skin factor accounts for all non-ideal conditions that are confined to a small region around the 
wellbore.
Examples are:
1.	 Invasion of mud filtrate (damage)
2.	 Partial penetration
3.	 Perforations
4.	 Fractures
5.	 Slant angle
Items 1 and 2 will decrease the productivity while 4 and 5 will improve it. Item 3 may decrease or improve 
the productivity depending on the length of the perforation density and tunnel length. 
4.2	
Steady state flow
If the external boundary is open such that the fluid produced is immediately replaced, then there is a 
possibility for steady state flow. Fluid replacement may be due to:	
1.	 An edge water drive
2.	 A pressure maintenance project
It is sufficient that one boundary is of constant pressure type. For instance, the top and bottom boundaries 
may be of constant pressure type due to an expanding gas cap or a bottom aquifer. These conditions are 
not discussed in these notes.
Consider steady state flow in a reservoir shaped like a cylinder with the well in the center.

Skin Factor
The words damage and stimulation are used for positive and negative skin factors respectively. The 
inflow performance may be improved by stimulation projects. A stimulated well may have damage if 
the reduced skin factor ends up with a positive skin factor.
Notice that there is a lower limit on a negative skin factor. Obviously, the actual wellbore pressure, 
wb
p
, cannot be higher than the pressure at the external boundary, 
ep . The skin factor of a well with 
stimulation is rarely less than –6. It may, however, assume high positive values. If sufficiently high, the 
well may not produce unless it is stimulated.
4.4	
Pseudo-steady flow
If the external boundary is closed, then comes a period of pseudo steady state type if the production 
rate is constant. During this regime, the derivative of the pressure with respect to time is constant and 
independent of position.
Since the rate of pressure decline is the same everywhere, the difference between the average pressure 
and the wellbore pressure is constant. The equation is

The model explains the effect of invasion of mud filtrate and acid injection in an intuitive way. The skin 
zone permeability, 
Sk , is reduced for the former and increased for the latter.

Equivalent Wellbore Radius
6	 Equivalent Wellbore Radius
6.1	
Introductory remarks
For some purposes it may be more convenient to take non-ideal conditions into account by the concept 
equivalent radius rather than skin. It may be difficult to visualize a hydraulic fracture as a thin skin. An 
obvious effect of a hydraulic fracture is to capture the fluid deeper into the reservoir, see Figure 1. The 
length of each fracture half-wing, 
fx , should at least extend beyond a possible skin zone of damage. 
A fictitious well with a larger radius, 
we
r , will also capture the fluid deeper into the reservoir. Hence, 
this may be a more realistic model than skin which may be regarded as a film. 
 
Figure 1: Well with a vertical fracture, top view
6.2	
The equivalent wellbore radius
The equivalent wellbore radius may be explained as: The fictitious wellbore radius which makes the 
calculated pressure of an ideal well equal to that of the equivalent actual one, see Figures 2 and 3.

Drawdown Test
7	 Drawdown Test
7.1	
Introductory remarks
The drawdown test is only possible for new wells or wells that have been closed in for a long period. 
Another disadvantage is that it may be difficult to keep the rate constant. The advantage is that one may 
produce while testing.
Well test interpretation depends on mathematical models. The observed pressure behavior in a test 
is matched to a plausible model. The target variable(s) are estimated from the matched model. If the 
assumed model is incorrect, the interpretation will lead to erroneous estimates. Interpretation of the 
drawdown test may serve as a first example of this technique. The assumptions are: Static equilibrium 
initially, constant production rate, homogeneous and infinite-acting reservoir. 
We introduce the concept of limiting forms. These are simplified equations that are valid, either for large 
or small, values of time. Limiting forms are easy to use and have sufficient accuracy for engineering 
calculations.

The target parameters to be obtained from interpretation of a drawdown test are the permeability and

sources like logging, core analysis, fluid analysis, production data, etc. The initial pressure is not known 
with sufficient precision. Hence 
ip  must also be obtained from another source, preferably a buildup test.
The well flowing pressure is predicted by the above equation (mathematical model). The same pressure,

The drawdown equation shows up as a straight line segment in a semi-logarithmic coordinate system.

when t2 and t1 are one decade apart. Note that the unit used for time, t, has no influence on the calculated 
slope. In case of noisy data, the best fit to the logarithmic straight line may be obtained by linear regression. 
7.4	
Determination of skin factor
A straight line is uniquely defined by the slope and its position in the coordinate system. The position is 
defined once the coordinates of a point on the line are known. Hence, a point on the straight line gives 
information that may be used to solve the model equation for an additional unknown. 
The traditional approach is to use the point given by the pressure at 1 hour, 
1hr
p
.
This point may not be on the straight line. This is because the pressure response may still be influenced 
by wellbore storage and skin. In such cases, the straight line is extrapolated until it intersects the vertical 
1
t = hr line. The technique is illustrated in Figure. 2.
Once the pressure at 1 hour has been obtained from the test, the drawdown equation becomes:

Note that the initial pressure,

permeability, k, was obtained from the slope calculated from the pressure signature. For consistency, use 
the same slope, m, that was obtained from the actual test. 
Note that only a small part of the available data has been used in the analysis. Use of the early and late 
time data in well test interpretation by straight lines in Cartesian coordinate system will be discussed in 
the chapters on Wellbore Storage and Reservoir Limit Test, respectively. We refer to straight line analysis 
of specific flow periods as special analysis. It is valid for a particular flow period only. The alternative is 
the type curve matching. By use of this technique, several flow periods may be analyzed simultaneously, 
see the chapter on Pressure Derivative.

The reservoir limit test is a long drawdown test. The objective is to quantify the pore volume, 
p
V , which 
is of economic importance. For instance, the initial oil in place, 
oi
N , is given by:
o
B
oi
o
S V
N
B
ϕ ⋅
=
In the above equation, the formation volume factor, 
o
B  and the bulk volume, 
B
V , may be obtained by 
PVT-analysis and seismic studies respectively. The average porosity, ϕ , and the oil saturation, 
o
S , may 
be estimated by core analysis or well logging.
The length scale of core analysis and logging is much smaller than the length scale of reservoir analysis 
while the length scale of seismic is larger. Upscaling and downscaling of measurements to the required 
length scale is uncertain. It is advantageous to avoid length scale problems as far as possible. An additional 
problem with core analysis is that only a tiny part of the reservoir is sampled. These problems can be 
mitigated by the reservoir limit test.
The pore volume, 
p
V , is given by:

With known pore volume, we can solve for either the average porosity or bulk volume if the other 
variable has a reliable estimate.

Reservoir of non-cylindrical shape
Suppose several production wells share the same reservoir area. Then, interference between wells will 
set up no-flow boundaries somewhere in between them. This is because the pressure is a continuous 
function of distance and that the pressure will increase away from each production well. The no-flow 
boundary will be at the maximum point, see Figure. 3. Note that the closed boundary is pushed towards 
the well with the lowest rate. Hence the better producer will drain a larger area.
It is common practice to allocate to each well a drainage area that is proportional to the production rate 
and in such a way that the sum of the areas adds up to the total area. Suppose we have two wells, well 
a and well b in a small reservoir, and that the latter produce with twice the rate of the former. Then the 
drainage area of well b will be twice as large as for well a, see Figure. 4.

The constant CA has been called the Dietz shape factor. It depends on the shape of the drainage area and 
the location of the well within the area. The shape factor has been tabulated for areas of simple shapes. 
For example, CA=31.6 for a circle, 30.9 for a quadrate and 27.6 for an equilateral triangle, all with a well 
in the centre. Many more are listed in the original work, Dietz, D.N., 1965. “Determination of reservoir

C are problematic. All cannot be determined from the 
straight line. Assuming the other variables are known, there are 3 equations and 4 unknowns. 
Assuming that the drainage areas may be allocated according to the production rates, a crude

in the table provided by Dietz, to get some idea of the shape of the drainage area and the location

The above theory implies the assumption of constant production rate. This condition is difficult to achieve

Interferenc e Test  –  Typ e Curve  Matchin
9	 Interference Test – Type Curve 
Matching
9.1	
Introductory remarks
An interference test involves more than one well. It is conducted by producing at least one well and 
measuring the pressure response in at least one observation well. An observation well has a pressure 
gauge to record pressure. The flow rate is zero.
We discuss interpretation by traditional type curve matching. Today, this can easily be done on a 
computer, but the principle remains unchanged. The theory can best be explained by the original 
approach. Interpretation of a sequence of flow periods is possible. A classic example is the wellbore 
storage transition into radial flow. Type curve analysis can be based on more information than semi-log 
analysis, which is valid for constant rate radial flow only. The method depends on some curvature in the 
curves to obtain a unique match.
A type curve is a log-log plot of the mathematical solution, i.e. the 
D
p -function for the test. If the 
correct mathematical model is applied, then the type curve may be matched to the field curve, log Δp vs. 
log t plot, to obtain the correct interpretation. Choice of a wrong model will lead to erroneous results. 
Unfortunately, well test responses are not unique. More than one plausible model may be available. 
9.2	
Interference test
The objectives of an interference test are:
--
To determine whether two or more wells are in pressure communication. If communication 
exists, some wells may be turned into injectors to displace hydrocarbons towards the 
production wells.
--
When communication exists, to provide estimates of the average permeability and storage 
capacity,  k and 
tc
ϕ
-product, between the wells.
--
To investigate the directional properties of the permeability (anisotropy). More than one 
observation well are necessary.
We use a simplified model. Assume two wells, one observation and one production well in a homogeneous 
infinite reservoir. The observation well does not produce and the wells are separated by a distance r.

The effect of the producing well in the observation well may be approximated by the line-source 
solution. A possible skin around the production well has negligible effect on the pressure measured in 
the observation well, unless the distance between the wells is short.
9.3	
The line source solution
The assumptions are: Static equilibrium initially, constant production, homogeneous- and infinite-acting 
reservoir. These are the same as for a drawdown test. The diffusivity equation has simple solution when 
the well assumes the shape of a line, i.e.

Hence, there is a possibility for semi-log analysis for interference tests. One may obtain the permeability-
thickness product from the slope of the semi-log straight line and the

of the straight line. This is rarely done since it will take a long time before the semi-log approximation

are matched when they overlap. The observed behavior has been matched to the model. To determine 
the displacement, we choose an arbitrary match-point, m.

10	 Pressure Buildup Test
10.1	
Introductory remarks
A pressure drawdown test has to start from a no-flow condition. Hence, a long flow period prior to shutin 
is required. In addition, it is difficult to keep the rate constant in a producing well. The latter problem 
is mitigated in a buildup test. The production rate is essentially zero (constant) once afterflow becomes 
negligible. In addition, the buildup test may be conducted any time. The disadvantage of the method is 
that the well has to be closed and will not generate income. From an economic perspective, the shutin 
time should be as short as possible. Unfortunately, shorter shutin period leads to less information. Hence, 
a trade-off between technical and economic objectives is necessary.

Determination of permeability
Note that the rate profile of Figure 1 is idealized. An instantaneous rate-change is not possible. There 
will be some flow into the well immediately after shutin. This phenomenon has been called afterflow 
(see: Wellbore Storage). As a consequence, the measured pressure will not obey the Horner equation 
initially. Note that the early part of the buildup curve falls on the right hand side of the Horner plot. 
This is because the shutin time, Dt, increases to the left (see Figure 2).

Bounded reservoir
Sooner or later the pressure wave associated with the flow period will hit the outer boundary. Under 
this condition, the Horner equation is not valid. Suppose the external boundary is of no-flow type. If 
the well is closed during boundary dominated flow, then the pressure will build up towards the average 
pressure rather than the initial pressure. This is illustrated in Figure 4. An intuitive explanation may go 
as follows: Suppose the pressure vs. distance profile at the instant of shutin is as shown in the schematic. 
Then, flow towards the well will continue due to the existing pressure gradient. As a result, the pressure 
will increase in the region that receives fluid (near wellbore region) and decrease where it leaves (outer 
region). In theory, the end result is a uniform pressure. In reality, the pressure in the reservoir may start 
to decrease after an initial buildup period. This is due to interference from surrounding production 
wells. The pressure decrease is normally not seen in a buildup test, since the shutin time is too short.

Experience has shown that the effect of the external boundary appears at the late part of the Horner 
plot only. The middle straight line- and early part remains practically unchanged. The boundary effect 
will show up as a break off from the straight line.

Determination of the average pressure
Matthews, Brons and Hazebroek presented charts that relate the false pressure to the average pressure for 
various geometries. The theory was based on the method of images, see the chapter on superposition.
Figure 6: Schematic of a Mattews,Brons and Hazebroek plot
We use index D to denote dimensionless variables.
The average pressure may be calculated as follows:
1.	 Obtain the slope m and the false pressure, 
*
p , from the Horner plot.
2.	 Estimate the shape and size of the drainage area. The traditional assumption is that the 
drainage area of each well is proportional to the flow rate and that the sum adds up to the 
total area.

Average reservoir pressure
The Matthews, Brons and Hazebroek methodology leads to calculation of the average pressure of a 
drainage area. After obtaining the average pressure for each well, the next step is to weight these to obtain 
the reservoir average pressure. Suppose the total production rate from the reservoir is 
tq  and that each 
well, j, drains a volume proportional to the rate, 
jq , during pseudo steady flow. Then:

Horner time
As mentioned previously, it is difficult to keep the flow rate constant. The rate may have fluctuated 
significantly prior to shutin. A real buildup test therefore involves three steps: stabilization of the 
production rate, a production period and shutin period. 
The variable rate condition contradicts the assumption of constant production rate which is implied in 
the buildup equation. Horner proposed the following correction to account for previous rate changes 
in an approximate way:
LAST
p
p
q
N
t =
p
N  is the cumulative production since the last major shutin period. This has usually a known value. The 
last stabilized rate is denoted by
LAST
q
. Hence, the Horner time, 
pt , is a synthetic production time. The 
Horner correction is not rigorous. One may, however, put forward intuitive arguments: It is consistent 
with material balance. It has dimension like time. The last production rate is usually more important 
than previous. Finally, the concept has been around since the fifties and still in use.
If the well is new, then one may calculate the variable rate buildup response by superposition in time. 
For an old well, superposition is impractical. If the cumulative production, 
p
N , is not known, one may 
use the Miller-Dyes –Hutchinson method. The latter method is not discussed here.

Introductory remarks
The logarithmic pressure derivative has the advantage of being dimensionally consistent with the pressure 
difference. Hence the two curves may be displayed in the same coordinate system. The field curves may 
be matched to their respective type curves simultaneously rather than sequentially. This is because the 
field curves for the pressure and pressure derivatives are related to their respective type curves in the 
same way:

Hence, the two field curves are shifted the same distance relative to their respective type curves. This 
improves the reliability of type curve analysis. The field curves may be matched against two type curves 
rather than one.
The pressure derivative has important diagnostic properties and may be used as an aid in identifying a 
plausible reservoir model. Specific flow periods show up as straight lines of known slopes on a log-log 
plot. For example, the following sequence of slopes: 1, 0.5, 0, suggests: wellbore storage, linear flow and 
radial flow. A plausible model may be a well with a vertical fracture in a large drainage area. A change 
in the the order of the sequence gives rise to other interpretations. For example, the sequence: 0, 0.5, 1, 
leads to the following interpretation: radial flow, linear and pseudo steady state flow. A plausible model 
could be: A vertical well in channel sand with no-flow external boundaries.

Pressure Derivative
This example illustrates the diagnostic properties of the pressure derivative. Wellbore storage may be 
recognized as an early unit slope straight line and the radial flow period shows up as a horizontal line. 
The hump in the derivative indicates a positive skin factor. With a negative skin factor, the pressure 
derivative curve will approach the horizontal line from below.
Other specific flow periods are of power-law type. A power-law flow period obeys the equation:

A and B are constants and the exponent n is a real number,

Pressure Derivative
Concurrent flow periods may be explained as follows: The effect of a well with a piecewise constant rate 
schedule may be computed by superposition in time. The technique may be thought about as replacing 
the actual well with constant rate fictitious wells, one for each rate change. Two wells are required for 
an ideal buildup, one production- and one injection well. For a well with after-flow, an additional well 
is required. The latter has time dependent rate to account for fluid flow into the well after shutin. 
Suppose we have radial flow towards the well and that there is no afterflow. If both the imaginary 
production – and the injection well are in the radial infinite-acting period, then there are two flow 
periods of the same type. As a consequence, the concept of equivalent time is valid. The concept, which 
is explained below, works equally well for flow periods of power-law type. The equations for equivalent 
time, however, will be different. 
Suppose there are two simultaneous radial flow periods. Then, the buildup may be described by the 
extended Horner equation

Derivation algorithm
A derivative is usually approximated by a finite difference quotient. As such it is sensitive to noise. Some 
smoothing may be necessary to filter out high frequency noise.
Most numerical filters depend on an even sampling rate. This is rarely the case in well testing. For a 
non-even spacing between sampled the points, the derivative may be approximated by the slope of a least 
square line through neighboring points. All points in the interval contribute to the computed derivative.

An alternative algorithm uses three points only, the point of interest, one to the left and one to the right.

A smaller difference, Δx, on the horizontal axis leads to a better approximation of the derivative. Hence, 
the highest weight factor is applied to the finite difference quotient with the smallest difference Δx.
It is recommended to start with consecutive points. If the degree of noise is unacceptable, then the

L has been called the smoothing parameter. The degree of smoothing will increase with increasing 
smoothing parameter. On the other hand, the accuracy of the derivative approximation will decrease. 
Hence, L should be kept as small as possible. Experience has shown that 
0.2
L ≈
is often a natural choice.
Any derivation algorithm has a problem near the ends of the interval. The calculation scheme is then 
running out of points. This phenomenon has been called the end effect of the pressure derivative. These 
regions have to be treated separately. One solution is to reduce the smoothing parameter close to the 
ends of the intervals.

Introductory remarks
Immediately after a rate change, the pressure response may be influenced by wellbore storage. In case of a 
decreased rate, more fluid will flow into the well than out. For an increase it will be the other way around. 
We discuss the storage effect for drawdown and buildup tests by use of simplified models. These may 
or may not be realistic. If the pressure signature is inconsistent with the predicted behavior, one should 
resort to a more complex model. Such models will not be discussed here.
A wellbore storage transition into constant rate infinite-acting behavior may be separated into three 
periods: the wellbore storage period, transition and finally infinite-acting. The wellbore storage period 
shows up as an early unit slope straight line on a log-log plot, 
w
p
D
vs. t. This period may or may not 
appear in a given test. It may have ended before the first pressure reading. If it does show up, type curve 
matching becomes more reliable since the interpretation is based on more information. The wellbore 
storage effect has died out at the end of the transition period. Then, constant rate infinite-acting behavior 
will exist until the pressure signal is influenced by the external boundary condition. For a small drainage 
area, the infinite-acting period may be short, even non-existing.

Wellbore Storage
Elementary well test interpretation techniques rely on the assumption of a constant rate. Suppose 
it is possible to keep the surface flow rate, q, constant. Then the first production derives from the 
wellbore rather than the reservoir. This phenomenon has been called well unloading. Unloading 
could be the result of fluid expansion or a moving gas liquid interface. The reservoir flow rate, 
sf
q , 
will build up gradually towards the surface flow rate. A schematic of the rate vs. time relationship 
is shown in Figure 1.

We consider two simplified models.

Suppose the well is filled with a high pressure reservoir fluid (oil, gas or water) as shown in Figure 2. 
Production starts when the choke at the top is opened and the well is exposed to a lower pressure. As a 
result, the fluid in the wellbore will expand.

2. Production by a moving gas-liquid interface
Consider the well in Figure 4, which has been closed. The pressure is a decreasing function of the vertical 
distance above the reservoir. At some position it may fall below the bubble point. Then gas comes out 
of solution and flow to the top. Suppose there is no packer and that the tubing is filled with a liquid (oil 
or water) all the way to the choke. The first fluid produced will be due to a falling liquid level in the 
annular space, which is the space between the casing and tubing. 
The model depends on simplifying assumptions.
• The pressure at the top of the well,
tp , is constant:
• The density of the gas is negligible in comparison with the liquid density.
• The effects of density changes are negligible.
• The effect of friction is negligible. (roughness of tubing surface)
Let z denote the position of the gas-liquid interface. Under these conditions, the wellbore pressure may 
be approximated by the static equation.

Buildup
As shown in the chapter on buildup testing, the pressure in the near wellbore region is lower than farther 
away after shutin. Fluid will continue to flow towards the near-wellbore region. It will also flow into 
the well. This is called afterflow. The fluid in the wellbore is compressed since fluid cannot flow out of 
the well. The material balance equation for the well is the same as for drawdown, but this time more is 
flowing into the well than out.

Introductory remarks
The present notes deals with the principle of superposition. Three applications will be discussed: Several 
wells in an infinite reservoir, the method of images and superposition in time.
The principle of superposition may be summarized as follows:
• The addition of solutions to a linear differential equation gives a new solution but for 
different boundary conditions.
• The total response of several wells may be computed by adding the response of each well 
as if this one was acting alone in infinite reservoir. Adding fictitious wells is a powerful 
technique to obtain solutions to the diffusivity equation. 
• The diffusivity equation has a unique solution. If a solution can be found that satisfies the 
differential equation and the boundary conditions, then this is the only solution. It may be 
possible to find an alternative solution to the same problem by use of another technique. If 
the resulting equation has a different appearance, it may be shown that they are equivalent 
by proving that the difference is zero.

Principle of Superposition
The criteria for linearity, both for the diffusivity equation and the boundary conditions, are:
• All derivatives (of pressure) with respect to the space and time variable in the first power. 
• No product of derivatives.
• All coefficients to derivatives independent of the solution, which in pressure transient 
analysis is pressure.
The line source solution is often used in well test interpretation. It is the solution to the diffusivity 
equation for a line source well. The drawdown at the wellbore is:

The line source solution implies the following assumptions:
• Infinite reservoir
• One well
• Constant production rate
• The well is shaped like a line,

The objective of this chapter is to generalize the utility of the line source solution by relaxing the first 
three assumptions.

Several wells in an infinite reservoir
Consider three wells A, B and C in an infinite reservoir. Each well is produced at a constant rate. The 
wells are put on production at different times and are produced with different rates.

 Figure 1: Three wells in an infinite reservoir
According to the principle of superposition, the total response of several wells may be found by computing 
the pressure change resulting from each well separately and then adding the pressure changes.
Suppose we are interested in computing the pressure in well A. According to the principle of superposition, 
the total pressure change may be separated into three components.

The response of each well is controlled by the production time. If a production time is negative, the 
corresponding Ei-function is zero since a well cannot create a pressure drop before it has been put on 
production.

Method of images
This discussion is limited to the application of the method of images to generate no-flow and constant 
pressure boundaries. So far, only infinite reservoirs have been discussed. Physical boundaries may be 
simulated by the method of images. We discuss the method in an intuitive way
The method of images may be thought of as a two step procedure.
1.	 Remove all boundaries.
2.	 Add imaginary wells until the boundary conditions are satisfied.
Addition of solutions to a linear equation gives a new solution, but for different boundary conditions. The 
boundary condition is satisfied when perfect symmetry with respect to all boundaries has been achieved.
Consider an infinite reservoir with a no-flow fault. It is known that the behavior of a well near a sealing 
fault in an infinite reservoir may be modeled by addition of an identical well at a symmetrical position 
with respect to the fault plane, just like a mirror image. The fictitious well has been called an image 
well. This is illustrated in Figure. 2. The position of a fault, after removal, is indicated by the broken line.

Figure 2: Use of the method of images to generate a no-flow boundary.
The image well interacts with the real well so that no flow occurs across the broken line. This is readily 
verified by showing that

 at this position. The same conclusion may be reached by symmetry 
considerations. A fluid particle at the fault position is equally attracted towards the real and the image 
well. Hence, no fluid can flow across this boundary.
A constant pressure boundary may be generated by the same procedure. In the latter case, there must 
be one injection well and one production well. The physical argument for assuming that interference 
between the actual well and the image well creates a constant pressure boundary is that the fluid produced 
is immediately replaced by flow across the constant pressure boundary. It is reasonable to expect that a 
gas cap or a large aquifer will approximately behave this way for a short well test. Such a boundary may 
also be created by a pressure maintenance scheme, i.e. gas and/or water injection.
 
Figure 3: Use of the method of images to generate a constant pressure boundary.
The proposition that interference between wells generates a constant pressure boundary may be verified as 
follows. Choose a coordinate system as shown in Figure 4 and compute the total pressure change, Δp, at 
an arbitrary position 
0y  along the y-axis.

A well in an infinite reservoir between two parallel faults has been selected as an example. Consider 
a well “A” in an infinite reservoir between two no-flow boundaries. Such reservoirs have been called 
channel sands.

Principle of Superposition
The upper boundary will be closed by adding image well b in Figure 5. In order to close the lower 
boundary, image wells c and d has to be added. This in turn will destroy the symmetry around the upper 
boundary. To restore the symmetry, image wells e and f must be added and the symmetry around the 
lower boundary is destroyed. This procedure may be continued until we have an infinite series of image 
wells. Then, the symmetry is perfect around both the upper and lower boundaries.
The combined effect of all wells may be obtained by adding the pressure drop created by each well. The 
pressure drop created by any well, may be computed as if this particular well was acting alone in an 
infinite reservoir.
In practice, sufficient accuracy is achieved by adding a comparatively small number of image wells. Wells 
located at large distances from the physical boundaries will contribute less to the reservoir pressure drop 
than close ones. Hence, the series may be truncated when the contribution from a distant image well 
becomes insignificant.
When summing up the series, we use the infinite reservoir solution, which is the line source solution.
13.4	
Superposition in time
Consider a well with a piecewise constant rate schedule. The actual well may be replaced by fictitious wells 
located at the same position as the real one. The production rate and start-up time of an imaginary well 
is determined from the condition that the total (sum) rate of all fictitious wells is equal to the production 
rate of the actual one. This technique is the basis for traditional buildup – and multi-rate test analysis. 
As an illustration of the technique, consider the rate sequence of Figure 6.a (the upper one).

Appendix A: Core Analysis
14	 Appendix A: Core Analysis
14.1	
Introduction
The most direct way of obtaining rock properties is by core analysis. Unfortunately the method is 
expensive and tedious. Hence cheaper indirect methods are preferred. A series of logging techniques are 
available. Results from indirect methods need to be calibrated against results obtained by core analysis. 
Also, results obtained by well testing need to be checked against results from core analysis. Hence, it is 
common practice to select a few wells for coring. The alternative is to use core analysis from a similar 
formation elsewhere. The traditional procedure is to take one sample for every foot drilled. Each sample 
is assumed to be representative for the one foot interval.
These notes will be focused on the comparison of well testing and core analysis. An example of results 
from core analysis is shown in Table 1. The formation is conspicuously heterogeneous on the length 
scale of core analysis. A length scale of a few centimeters is impractical for reservoir flow studies. For 
instance, the length scale of a computational cell in reservoir simulation may be a few meters in the 
vertical direction and around 100 m in the horizontal directions. Average values for the rock properties 
are required for reservoir studies. Unfortunately it is unclear what the best average is.

Appendix A: Core Analysis
The problem of obtaining a reliable average to be used on a larger length scale (upscaling) remains a 
challenge. We will choose the traditional approach which is based on simplified analytical models.
Core analysis is fraught with sources of errors. For example, coring and handling may alter the rock 
properties. Exposure to a radically different stress condition may have the same effect. It may be impossible 
to obtain an unbiased set of samples. Some intervals may be to weak for coring, others may be too thin. 
It may be impractical to analyze tight cores, etc. 
14.2	
Well testing
A well test operates on a much larger length scale (10–100m in the horizontal direction) than core 
analysis. The pressure signature obtained, by well test, will in many cases behave as for an equivalent 
homogeneous reservoir. The effect of heterogeneities will show up only for small values of time. Observe 
that the length scale of well testing is comparable to that of reservoir simulation. A well test is expensive 
and may not be available for all wells.
14.3	
Average porosity obtained by core analysis
The arithmetic average may be best for the porosity, since it is consistent with material balance. Also the 
variation in the porosity values is moderate. This is illustrated by the schematic below.

Figure 2: Permeability as a function of depth
The average permeability is a problematic concept since the values can be different by several orders of 
magnitudes. Also the average permeability depends on how the permeability is distributed in the spatial 
domain.
The average permeability may be established by the use of analytical flow models in a few simple cases. 
Steady state flow may be described by Darcy’s law. An analysis based on integration of Darcy’s law leads 
to important observations.

Note that the powerlaw average includes all the elementary averages as follows:
1.	 The harmonic average, p = -1
2.	 The geometric average, p = 0
3.	 The arithmetic average, p = 1
4.	 All possible powerlaw averages in between the averages listed above.

Commingled reservoir
A layered reservoir without crossflow is called a commingled reservoir. Flow from one layer into another 
one has been called crossflow. This possibility is ruled out by the existence of impervious layers between 
the permeable ones. For such cases, one may use the geometric average within each layer and the estimate 
the total permeability by use of the arithmetic average of the layer permeabilities.

Introductory remarks
So far, all equations have been expressed in a consistent unit system. The SI unit system is 
consistent. A consistent unit system respects the dimensions of all variables such that all constants 
are dimensionless. For example, the constant 2π is dimensionless. Dimensional analysis shows 
that the dimension of permeability is L2 (like area). The corresponding SI unit is m2. Consistent 
SI units are listed in Table 1. The advantage is transparency. It is easy to check whether an 
equation is dimensional consistent or not. 
No unit system can be flexible enough to suit all purposes. A consistent unit system may lead to key 
variables with inconvenient numerical values. For example, pressure may assume the value of 3000 psi 
or 
8
2.1 10
⋅
 Pa depending on the unit system. In the same unit systems, the permeability could assume 
either the value of 1 mD or 
-16
1 10
⋅
m2. The magnitudes of the first values are considered more “practical” 
than the latter. The reason is that numerical values fall within a range that most people are familiar with. 
A practical unit system is designed to give convenient numerical values. This may be achieved by use 
of dimensional constants in the equations.

Table 1: Darcy, SI and American Field Units
The traditional way of obtaining permeability is by core analysis. Hence, the unit for permeability (Darcy 
denoted by D) is designed for small scale laboratory experiments. The resulting numerical values are 
convenient for laboratory work. This unit system has been called Darcy units. It is a “mixed unit system” 
since pressure (atm) and viscosity (cP) depends on different unit systems. The Darcy unit system is 
inconvenient for oilfield calculations since the basic units are too small. A practical unit system, for field 
behavior, can be based on a metric system, American Field Units or a combination.
15.2	
Consistent SI Units
To illustrate the advantage of a consistent unit system, let us check the dimensional consistency of the 
drawdown equation for radial flow:

For dimensional consistency (dimensionless constants only), the terms within bracket are required to 
be dimensionless. This is because the skin factor is dimensionless. The left hand side of the equation 
has the unit for pressure, which is Pa (Pascal). Hence, dimensional consistency dictates that the group 
of variables in front of the bracket also has unit Pa. 
The above proposition may be tested by including the units in the equation. These are enclosed within 
square brackets.

By cancellation of common units, it is clear that the argument in the logarithmic expression is 
dimensionless. Again (by cancellation of units) the coefficient to the parenthesis has the unit Pa, which 
is the unit of pressure. The last requirement for dimensional consistency is that the left and right hand 
side of the equation have the same unit, Pa. It is clear that all requirements are satisfied. Thus, the 
dimensional consistency of the equation has been verified.
The argument of the logarithmic term is a dimensionless function of time. The group has been called 
dimensionless time.

A dimensionless group for pressure may be defined in the same way. The ratio of the pressure drawdown, 
Dpwf, to the pressure group on the right hand side of the drawdown equation is obviously dimensionless. 
Hence a dimensionless pressure, pD-function, may be defined as:

A dimensionless equation is independent of any unit system. The definition of dimensionless variables, 
however, may involve a constant that depends on the unit system. 
Note that the number of variables in the dimensionless drawdown equation is dramatically reduced 
when compared against the corresponding dimensional one. This is because dimensionless variables are 
defined by grouping variables. Hence, dimensionless solutions are useful for graphs and tables.
15.3	
American Field Units
We introduce the American Field Units in the dimensionless time. With each variable, associate a 
conversion factor to convert the practical unit back to the corresponding SI unit, which is characterized 
by dimensionless constants.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can

A practical system has the advantage of convenient numerical values. This objective may be obtained at 
the expense of reduced dimensional transparency.
Dimensionless equations remain unchanged regardless of unit system. This property has important 
consequences:
• The number of variables in a dimensionless equation is significantly reduced when compare 
against the corresponding dimensional one. Hence, dimensionless solutions are convenient 
for tables and graphs.
• Type curve matching can be performed with the same dimensionless graphs regardless of 
unit system. The translation factors, however, depend on the unit system.
• Dimensionless equations can easily be converted back to any unit system. 
• The diffusivity equation is important in many disciplines. All share the same solutions. 
Notable non-petroleum examples are: heat flow and groundwater hydrology. Use of 
dimensionless equations may facilitate technology transfer between disciplines.
