Preface
One of the most vital industries worldwide is the manufacturing industry. The man­
ufacturing industry is a cornerstone of national economy and people’s livelihood. 
Manufacturing is regarded as a prime generator of wealth and is critical in establish­
ing a sound basis for economic growth. From craft production to cloud manufactur­
ing, manufacturing has become an ever-increasingly complex process, relying on 
many new technologies.
Manufacturing is the way of transforming resources into products or goods 
which are required to cater to the needs of the society. It refers to the entire product 
life cycle: product design, production planning, production, distribution, field ser­
vice, and reclamation. It consists of a set of processes, machines, and factories 
where raw materials are transformed into products. There are different types of 
manufacturing including biopharmaceutical manufacturing, chemical manufactur­
ing, discrete manufacturing, advanced manufacturing, smart manufacturing, cloud 
manufacturing, offshore manufacturing, lean manufacturing, green manufacturing, 
distributed manufacturing, predictive manufacturing, and computer-aided manufac­
turing. The leading manufacturing industries in the United States include steel, 
automobiles, chemicals, food processing, consumer goods, aerospace, and mining.
Traditional manufacturing companies currently face several challenges such as 
rapid technological changes, inventory problem, shortened innovation, short prod­
uct life cycles, volatile demand, low prices, highly customized products, and ability 
to compete in the global markets. Modern manufacturing is highly competitive due 
to globalization and fast changes in the global market. Globalization has had a huge 
impact on economic, social, and political changes. The manufacturing industry has 
become more competitive due to globalization. To survive from the global market, 
manufacturing enterprises should reduce the product cost and increase the produc­
tivity. Manufacturing systems are evolving into a new generation of data-driven 
systems that must adapt to these changes in a timely fashion. In today’s manufactur­
ing, technology is the determining factor for securing competitive advantage. The 
industry has always been receptive to adopting new technologies such as drones, 
industrial robots, artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality, and Internet of Things. 

viii
These technologies have come to rescue many manufacturing organizations drowned 
in the deluge of data, data explosion, and information overload. Manufacturers and 
policy-makers must keep track of more than 60 technologies and philosophies shap­
ing manufacturing today. For each technology, they must assess its readiness, adop­
tion level, and its most relevant applications in manufacturing and the key barriers 
to further adoption.
This book reviews emerging technologies in manufacturing. These technologies 
include artificial intelligence, smart manufacturing, lean manufacturing, robotics, 
automation, 3D printing, nanotechnology, industrial Internet of Things, digital 
twins or cyber-physical systems (CPS) and augmented reality. The use of these 
technologies will have a profound impact on the manufacturing industry. They have 
the potential to transform manufacturing as we know it. They will decrease labor 
costs, improve efficiency, and reduce waste, making factories to be more 
environment-­friendly. They should be at the core of any manufacturing upgrading 
effort. To remain competitive, forward-thinking manufacturers should embrace 
these emerging manufacturing technologies.
This book is designed to provide an introductory treatment on newly emerging 
technologies for manufacturing. It consists of 19 chapters. Each chapter addresses a 
single emerging technology in depth and describes how manufacturing organizations 
are adopting the technology. Chapter 1 provides an introduction on emerging tech­
nologies in manufacturing. Chapter 2 covers artificial intelligence (AI), which is the 
cognitive science that deals with intelligent machines which are able to perform tasks 
heretofore only performed by human beings. Today, the manufacturing industry is 
using artificial intelligence and machine learning to streamline every phase of produc­
tion and increase productivity. In Chap. 3, we discuss the uses of robotic automation 
in manufacturing. Automation can assist the manufacturing industry by reducing 
labor costs substantially, increase quantity or generate more output for a given period 
of time, improve product quality, and mitigate risk. Chapter 4 covers smart manufac­
turing, which has gained significant impetus as a breakthrough technological develop­
ment that can transform the landscape of manufacturing today and tomorrow. It aims 
to take advantage of advanced information and manufacturing technologies to enable 
flexibility in physical processes to address a dynamic and global market.
Chapter 5 presents Industry 4.0 as a manufacturing initiative. Industry 4.0 enables 
the digitalization of manufacturing sector with built-in sensing devices virtually in all 
manufacturing components, products, and equipment. It has been involved in smart 
transportation and logistics, smart buildings, oil and gas, smart healthcare, smart cit­
ies, to name a few. Chapter 6 introduces Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which 
refers to particular applications of IoT to industrial environments. IIoT is a new indus­
trial ecosystem that combines intelligent and autonomous machines in support of digi­
tal twinning and cyberphysical systems. It is bringing about a world where smart, 
connected embedded systems and products operate as part of larger systems. Chapter 
7 covers big data, which refers to the large volume of structured and unstructured data 
with the potential to be mined for information. The manufacturing industry has joined 
the big data bandwagon as well because data have long been the lifeblood of manu­
facturing. Big data analytics can provide the manufacturing industry the need to

succeed in an increasingly complex environment. In Chap. 8, additive manufacturing 
is presented. It adds material to create complex and intricate objects in the context of 
less material waste, while simultaneously cutting industrial resources waste. While 
traditional production systems proceed by subtraction, additive manufacturing 
involves fabricating a 3D object by successively adding material. Compared to sub­
tractive manufacturing, additive manufacturing can compete with or beat traditional 
manufacturing processes in terms of cost and adaptability.
In Chap. 9, we address green manufacturing, which is a new trend for the future 
development of the manufacturing industry. Green manufacturing refers to modern 
manufacturing that makes products without pollution. It addresses a wide range of 
environmental and sustainability issues including resource selection, transportation, 
manufacturing process, and pollution. Chapter 10 dwells on sustainable manufactur­
ing, which is manufacturing products through economically sound processes that 
minimize negative environmental impacts while conserving energy and natural 
resources. The goal of sustainable manufacturing is to minimize waste, maximize 
resource efficiency, and reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing. Chapter 
11 presents lean manufacturing, which is all about doing more with less by applying 
“lean thinking.” It is a systematic method that focuses on eliminating or reducing 
waste within manufacturing systems without sacrificing productivity. Chapter 12 
introduces the readers to distributed manufacturing, which refers to decentralized fab­
rication of parts in smaller factories or homes that are local to end-users. This manu­
facturing-as-a-service model is achieved by making small orders and prototyping 
affordable and building their production facilities near the places of consumption.
Chapter 13 deals with cloud manufacturing, which is also known as manufacturing-­
as-­a-Service. It is a newly emerging approach of adopting well-known basic con­
cepts from cloud computing to manufacturing processes and delivering shared, 
ubiquitous, on-demand manufacturing services. It refers to a customer-centric 
approach to enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared 
pool of manufacturing resources and capabilities. In Chap. 14, we cover nanomanu­
facturing, which is the manufacturing of objects or material with dimensions 
between 1 and 100 nanometers. It focuses on developing scalable, high-yield pro­
cesses for the production of materials, structures, devices, and systems at the 
nanoscale. Chapter 15 introduces the concept of ubiquitous manufacturing. 
Ubiquitous manufacturing is an application of ubiquitous computing which is a 
concept where computing is made to appear everywhere and anywhere. It empha­
sizes the mobility and dispersion of manufacturing resources, products, and users. 
Chapter 16 addresses offshoring manufacturing, which takes place when production 
operations are performed in another country, from one country to a low-cost coun­
try. It is considered an option when a company wants to reduce operating expenses 
while maintaining high-quality product.
In Chap. 17, we discuss cyber manufacturing, a modern manufacturing approach 
that utilizes cyber-physical systems also popularized as digital twins. It may be 
regarded as the convergence of cyber-physical systems, systems engineering, and 
manufacturing innovation. It is a new transformative concept that involves the trans­
lation of data from interconnected systems into predictive and prescriptive

operations, leveraging the advantages of augmented reality. Chapter 18 dwells on 
biomanufacturing, the production of biological products from living cells. It is an 
emerging manufacturing process that utilizes biological systems to produce com­
mercially important biomaterials and biomolecules. It is used in medicine, food 
industry, and industrial applications. Chapter 19 addresses the future of manufactur­
ing, which is undeniably digital and will be shaped by a combination of advance­
ments in technology. Other topics on emerging technologies in manufacturing, not 
covered as chapters in the book or not covered at all, are listed in Appendix A.
The book fills an important niche for manufacturing. It is a comprehensive, intro­
ductory text on the issues, ideas, theories, and problems of emerging technologies 
in manufacturing. It provides an introduction to these technologies so that beginners 
can understand the technologies, their increasing importance, and their develop­
ments in contemporary time. It is a must-read book for anyone who wants to be 
updated about emerging technologies.

Introduction
1.1  Introduction
Manufacturing is the way of transforming resources into products or goods which 
are required to cater to the needs of the society. It constitutes the foundation of any 
nation’s economic development. The manufacturing industry includes many sectors 
such aerospace industry, food and beverage industry, mining industry, apparel 
industry, chemical industry, automotive industry, metal and machinery industry, 
packaging industry, and electronics industry. Manufacturing has been noted as one 
of the largest industries globally. It is a key component of economic output of any 
nation because of its contribution to GDP and employment generation. Manufacturing 
basically impacts economic structures at global, regional, national, and local levels.
Manufacturers are well known for being slow in adopting a new technology. To 
remain competitive and reach its full potential, the manufacturing organization will 
need to continue to embrace new technologies. To stay ahead of competitors and 
win market share in today’s quickly morphing environment, manufacturers should 
embrace change.
What manufacturing looks like has changed drastically within a short time. 
Manufacturing has evolved from a mechanical process to a set of processes based 
on the integration of information and technology. Technologies touch on every step 
of the end-to-end manufacturing process and global value chains. A set of new tech­
nologies that promise to boost productivity is emerging. In this chapter, we will 
address eight sweeping manufacturing technology trends which can disrupt and 
change how manufacturing companies execute current processes. These emerging 
technologies will impact the prospects for manufacturing in the early twenty-first 
century [1].
R&D scientists and engineers are playing a critical role in delivering the latest 
and greatest technology. They have long realized the benefits and the risks of emerg­
ing technologies. Manufacturing organizations will continue to pursue new 
Manufacturing is more than just putting parts together. It’s 
coming up with ideas, testing principles and perfecting the 
engineering, as well as final assembly.

technologies that are better than the status quo. They will invest in technologies that 
digitize human efforts down to each movement. Their willingness to explore these 
technologies indicates that digitization in manufacturing is long overdue.
This chapter provides an introduction to emerging technologies in manufactur­
ing. It presents some emerging manufacturing technologies. It addresses the bene­
fits and challenges of the emerging technologies. It considers the global aspect of 
emerging technologies in manufacturing. The last section concludes with comments.
1.2  Some Emerging Technologies
Here, we consider some emerging technologies that are changing the face of manu­
facturing. They can disrupt and change how manufacturing companies execute cur­
rent processes. They will make a lasting impact. We will take a deeper look at the 
following key technologies:
	1.	 Artificial Intelligence: Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to intelligence exhibited 
by machines or computer systems in being able to perform some tasks that are 
normally considered to require human intelligence. AI has several functions 
such as learning, understanding, reasoning, interaction, and decision-making. 
Technologies that emanate from AI (known as cognitive technologies) include 
expert systems, fuzzy logic, machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, 
natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, and robotics.
In particular, machine learning, a branch of AI, uses algorithms to get com­
puters to perform a task effectively without being programmed explicitly. AI and 
machine learning are widely used in manufacturing for demand forecasting and 
predictive maintenance. AI is used at various points of the manufacturing pro­
cess. An area of manufacturing where AI has been applied with great success is 
aircraft assembly. Manufacturing efficiency and maintaining product quality 
remain top priorities in some industries such as the information communication 
and integrated circuit (IC2) industry, where process and equipment reliability 
directly influence cost, throughput, and yield [2]. Machine learning can help 
manufacturers analyze data, automatically discover hidden opportunities, accel­
erate tedious processes, identify which data insights matter, and reduce opera­
tional costs. AI is used at various points in the manufacturing process at BMW’s 
plants to save costs and streamline production.

	8.	 Nanotechnology: Nanotechnology is an umbrella concept that encompasses a 
range of scientific disciplines focused on the manipulation of matter at the 
atomic and molecular levels. This is regarded as the science of working with 
matter at the molecular scale. It encompasses a range of scientific disciplines 
focused on the manipulation of matter at the atomic, subatomic, and molecular 
levels. There are two main approaches to using nanotechnology in manufactur­
ing (nanomanufacturing): top-down and bottom-up. In top-down nanomanufac­
turing, material is systematically reduced until only the finished microscopic 
product remains. In bottom-up nanomanufacturing, products are built by gradu­
ally adding atomic- and molecular-level particles until the product is finished, 
similar in nature of its operations to conventional 3D printing [13]. 
Nanotechnology has many everyday applications across a range of sectors. 
Nanomanufacturing is being used for other preventative measures to control the 
spread of COVID-19.
Other emerging technologies include big data, cloud computing, wearables, 
drones, digital twins, blockchain, virtual reality, generative design, materials tech­
nology, predictive analytics, advanced manufacturing, 5G, and cybersecurity. 
Integration of these new technologies can seem daunting.
1.3  Benefits
New technologies and innovations tend to create manufacturing jobs. Besides 
reducing costs and saving money, these technologies reduce waste, decrease overall 
production time, and enhance precision, accuracy, repeatability, efficiency, and flex­
ibility for the manufacturing industry. From 3D printing to big data analytics to 
collaborative robots, the game-changing benefits of newly emerging technologies 
bring unprecedented transformations. They are helping manufacturers reduce 
human intervention, increase productivity, reduce risk, minimize downtime, and 
optimize market competitiveness. The new technologies will impact the manufac­
turing industries beyond recognition.
The emerging technologies are shaping the future of manufacturing by lowering 
the cost of production, improving the speed of operations, and minimizing errors. 
However, the manufacturing process has a long way to go before it reaches there.
Manufacturing organizations are realizing that the new technology trends have 
become less of an addition and more of a necessity for their business to remain 
competitive. Advancements of these technologies offer manufacturers opportunities 
to accelerate production timelines. The technologies can be used to create products 
that satisfy unmet needs. Integration of these trends, tools, and technologies can 
seem daunting, but it will result in increased efficiency. Global manufacturing com­
panies can best capitalize on emerging technologies. They are benefitting from 
increase in productivity, decrease in the complexities of processes, substantial cost 
savings, faster production times, and the ability to provide excellent customer 
support.

1.4  Challenges
The twenty-first century manufacturing companies face unpredictable market 
changes driven by global competition, rapid introduction of new products, and con­
stantly changing product demand. The main barrier in most countries is the lack of 
inventiveness for new technologies. Manufacturers are known to be slow adopters 
of technology. While the emerging technologies have the potential to speed up the 
time it takes to make a new product, the technologies are not without their draw­
backs. It is challenging to implement technology solutions in a crowded vendor 
marketplace. Integration of the emerging technologies seems daunting.
Finding suppliers, for 3D-printed parts, for example, and keeping track of the 
sourcing of parts and materials and gaining trust can be difficult and time-­consuming. 
Typically, the shop floors have old machines that still have years of production left 
in them, and it is not economical to replace them. Workers on the shop floor need to 
be more skilled than ever, and there may be no jobs for high school graduates in 
some manufacturing companies. Since all emerging manufacturing technologies are 
not created equal, further research needs to be conducted to develop specific deploy­
ment methodologies for specific technologies [14]. As the number of technologies 
impacting today’s manufacturing increases, the bandwidth demands are intensifying.
1.5  Global Aspect of Emerging Technologies 
in Manufacturing
Manufacturers around the world are already employing emerging technologies to 
modernize their manufacturing operations to make them more efficient, cost-­
effective, and responsive to market demands. Researchers around the world are 
unlocking the potential of emerging manufacturing technologies. There is a global 
lack of skills base to fully exploit the emerging technologies. Resolving these chal­
lenges may take decades.
The IEEE Future Directions Committee (FDC) determines the direction of exist­
ing, new, and emerging technologies and spearheads their investigation and devel­
opment. The primary objective of FDC is to incubate emerging technologies and 
serve as a catalyst for disseminating information about the technologies by sponsor­
ing conferences, publications, and standards development [15].
Realizing the importance of manufacturing to their industrial future, several 
national governments have initiated programs to support the deployment of the new 
technologies in support of their domestic manufacturers [16]. Some nations like the 
United States, China, Singapore, and the European Union are investing heavily on 
the development and promotion of additive manufacturing technologies. To maxi­
mize AI adoption, nations will need privacy regimes that allow the use and reuse of 
data. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated a global need for inexpensive, 
easily manufactured medical equipment to fight sudden outbreaks of disease. In the

near future, one can expect reshoring to be the leading trend, as manufacturers 
attempt to reduce dependencies on foreign materials.
1.6  Conclusion
Manufacturing is becoming increasingly more efficient, customized, automated, 
and lean. As the cutting-edge technologies are being employed in industrial settings, 
manufacturing could be taken to unprecedented levels of production. The impact of 
these emerging technologies cannot be underestimated.
Manufacturing across sectors will take a long time before fully implementing 
these emerging technologies. Manufacturers must be willing to embrace change in 
order to stay ahead of competitors and win market share. They should establish 
long-term and short-term goals and then determine what type of technology they 
need to achieve their goals.
In the near future, manufacturing engineers and researchers will be in great 
demand to perform cost-benefit analyses, solve production issues, and operate CAD 
software to design and produce products. Emerging technologies are also expected 
to transform the type of skills required by its workforce. As manufacturers increas­
ingly adopt new technologies, their need to hire tech-savvy workers is increasing. 
Unfortunately, there are not enough skilled employees to fill the open jobs. Education 
reform should focus on enabling existing and emerging employers to get better 
technical skills, particularly “twenty-first century generic skills,” and produce new 
generation of workers. Education will liberate designers from old patterns of think­
ing and allow them to tap into ideation and innovation of futuristic technologies. As 
a Siemens executive once said, “People on the plant floor need to be much more 
skilled than they were in the past. There are no jobs for high school graduates at 
Siemens today.”
We are excited and optimistic about the future and the role that digitalization, 
through the emerging technologies, will play to bring the concepts to reality.

Artificial Intelligence in Manufacturing
2.1  Introduction
One of the most vital industries in the world is manufacturing. Manufacturing refers 
to the entire product life cycle: product ideation, design, production planning, pro­
duction operation, control, scheduling, distribution, supply chain, field service, and 
reclamation [1]. The manufacturing industry is a cornerstone of the national econ­
omy and people’s livelihood.
Traditional manufacturing companies currently face several challenges such as 
rapid technological changes, inventory problem, shortened innovation span, short 
product life cycles, volatile demand, low prices, highly customized products, and 
ability to compete in the global markets. In today’s manufacturing, technology is the 
determining factor for securing competitive advantage. The industry has always 
been receptive to adopting new technologies such as drones, industrial robots, arti­
ficial intelligence (AI), virtual reality, and Internet of Things. These technologies 
have come to rescue organizations such manufacturing drowned in the deluge of 
data, data explosion, and information overload.
Today, the manufacturing industry is using artificial intelligence and machine 
learning to streamline every phase of production and increase productivity.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the cognitive science that deals with intelligent 
machines which are able to perform tasks heretofore only performed by human 
beings. It is mainly concerned with applying computers to tasks that require knowl­
edge, perception, reasoning, understanding, and cognitive abilities. AI is potentially 
the algorithmic study of processes in every field of study [2]. The main objective of 
AI is to teach the machines to think intelligently like humans do.
Although AI is a branch of computer science, there is hardly any field which is 
unaffected by this technology. Common areas of applications include agriculture, 
business, law enforcement, oil and gas, banking and finance, education, transporta­
tion, healthcare, automobiles, entertainment, manufacturing, speech and text 
The world’s technocrats are yet to fully grasp and deploy the 
genius of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the immensity of its 
powers to transform societies and elevate the quality of life of 
world citizens.

recognition, facial analysis, and telecommunications. Over the years, the field of AI 
has produced a number of tools for manufacturing. Today, industrial leaders such as 
Google, Microsoft, Procter & Gamble, and IBM have invested heavily on AI [3].
This chapter addresses the uses of artificial intelligence in the manufacturing 
industry. It begins by reviewing AI. It discusses the roles AI plays in manufacturing. 
It highlights the benefits and challenges of applying AI in manufacturing. It covers 
how AI is being applied in manufacturing around the world. It addresses the future 
of AI in manufacturing. The last section concludes with comments.
2.2  Overview on Artificial Intelligence
In simple terms, artificial intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems that mimic 
human cognitive functions. The term “artificial intelligence” (AI) was first used at a 
Dartmouth College conference in 1956. The main goal of AI is to enable machines 
to perform complex tasks that typically require human intelligence [4]. AI is now 
one of the most important global issues of the twenty-first century.
AI is not a single technology but a range of computational models and algo­
rithms. AI is a collection of techniques that enables computer systems to perform 
tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence [5]. The major disciplines in 
AI include:

	2.	 Fuzzy logic: This AI discipline makes it possible to create rules for how machines 
respond to inputs that account for a continuum of possible conditions, rather 
than straightforward binary. Where each variable is either true or false (yes or 
no), the system needs absolute answers. However, these are not always available.

Fuzzy logic allows variables to have a “truth value” between 0 and 1. It uses 
approximate human reasoning in knowledge-based systems. It was introduced in 
the 1960s by Lotfi Zadeh of University of California, Berkeley, known as father 
of fuzzy set theory. Fuzzy logic is useful in manufacturing processes as it can 
handle situations that cannot be adequately handled by traditional true/false 
logic [7].
	3.	 Neural networks: This discipline of AI provides specific types of machine learn­
ing systems that consist of artificial synapses designed to imitate the structure 
and function of brains. An artificial neural network (ANN) is an information 
processing device that is inspired by the way the brain processes information. 
They were originally developed to mimic the learning process of the human 
brain. The idea of ANNs was inspired by the structure of the human brain and by 
the synthesis, simulation, extraction, codification, and processing of what the 
brain can do. They may be regarded as a sort of parallel processor designed to 
imitate the way the brain accomplishes tasks. They are made up of artificial neu­
rons that take in multiple inputs and produce a single output. In other words, the 
purpose of a neuron is to collect inputs and to generate outputs. The network 
observes and learns as the synapses transmit data to one another, processing 
information as it passes through multiple layers [9].
	4.	 Machine learning: Machine learning (ML) is essentially the study of computer 
algorithms that improve automatically through experience and iterative pattern 
associations, recognitions, looping, and uses. It is the field that focuses on how 
computers learn from data. This includes a broad range of algorithms and statis­
tical models that make it possible for systems to find patterns, draw inferences, 
and learn to perform tasks without specific instructions. Machine learning is a 
process that involves the application of AI to automatically perform a specific 
task without explicitly programming it. Learning algorithms work on the 
assumption that strategies, algorithms, and inferences that worked well in the 
past are likely to work well in the future. ML techniques may result in data 
insights that increase production efficiency. Using ML can save time for practi­
tioners and provide unbiased, repeatable results. Today, artificial intelligence is 
narrow and mainly based on machine learning.
2.2  Overview on Artificial Intelligence

16
There are two types of learning: supervised learning and unsupervised learn­
ing. Supervised learning focuses on classification and prediction. It involves 
building a statistical model for predicting or estimating an outcome based on one 
or more inputs. It is often used to estimate risk. Supervised ML is where algo­
rithms are given training data. In unsupervised learning, we are interested in 
finding naturally occurring patterns within the data. Unlike supervised learning, 
there is no predicted outcome. Unsupervised learning looks for internal structure 
in the data. Unsupervised learning algorithms are common in neural network 
models. Machine learning techniques have been applied in the analysis of data in 
various fields including medicine, finance, business, education, advertising, 
cybersecurity, and manufacturing [10]. Manufacturers are turning to machine 
learning to improve the end-to-end performance of their operations.
	5.	 Deep learning: This is a form of machine learning based on artificial neural net­
works. Deep learning may be regarded as a software technology designed by 
programmers to teach computers to do what humans have been doing: learning 
by example or learning from data. Deep learning (DL) architectures are able to 
process hierarchies of increasingly abstract features, making them especially 
useful for purposes like speech and image recognition and natural language pro­
cessing. Deep learning networks can deal with complex nonlinear problems. It 
extracts complex features from high-dimensional data and applies them to 
develop a model that relates inputs to outputs. The most common form of deep 
learning architectures is multilayer neural networks. Deep learning has many 
advantages over shallow learning. Due to this, deep learning networks have 
received much attention as they can deal with more complex nonlinear problems.
Recently, companies such as IBM, Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Baidu have 
invested and developed deep learning. They have taken advantage of their mas­
sive data and large computational power to deploy deep learning on a large scale. 
DL has several applications in the manufacturing domain including sales fore­
casting and advanced analytics. Although DL has achieved some success and 
found applications in various fields, it is still in its infancy [11].
	6.	 Natural Language Processors: For AI to be useful to us humans, it needs to be 
able to communicate with us in our language. Language is crucial around the 
world in communication, entertainment, media, culture, drama, movie, and 
economy. Computer programs can translate or interpret language as it is spoken 
by normal people. Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the field of study 
that focuses on the interactions between human language and computers. It is a 
computational approach to text analysis. It involves the study of mathematical 
and computational modeling of various aspects of language. It is an interdisci­
plinary field involving computer science, linguistics, logic, and psychology.
NLP is important because of the major role language such as English plays in 
human intelligence and because of the wealth of potential applications. 
Applications of NLP include interfaces to expert systems and database query 
systems, machine translation, text generation, story understanding, automatic 
speech recognition, and computer-aided instruction. It also has great potential in 
­healthcare, mobile technology, cloud computing, virtual reality, election, social 
work, and social networking [12].

	7.	 Robots: AI is heavily used in robots, which are computer-based programmable 
machines that have physical manipulators and sensors. Sensors can monitor tem­
perature, humidity, pressure, and time, record data, and make critical decisions 
in some cases. Robots have moved from science fiction to your local hospital. In 
jobs with repetitive and monotonous functions, they might even completely 
replace humans. Robotics and autonomous systems are regarded as the fourth 
industrial revolution.
Robotics is a branch of engineering and computer science that involves the 
conception, design, manufacture, and operation of robots. A robot functions as 
an intelligent machine, meaning that it can be programmed to take actions or 
make choices based on input from sensors. It involves using electronics, com­
puter science, artificial intelligence, mechatronics, and bioengineering. Robots 
are applied in many fields including agriculture, education, manufacturing, 
entertainment, medicine, space exploration, undersea exploration, sex, power 
grid, agriculture, construction, meat processing, household, mining, aerospace, 
electronics, and automotive. For example, robot police with facial recognition 
technology have started to patrol the streets in China. Future robots will operate 
in highly networked environments where they will communicate with other sys­
tems such as industrial control systems and cloud services [13].
2.2 15
­
AI-driven systems can discover trends, reveal inefficiencies, and predict future 
outcomes. These characteristics enable informed decision-making and make AI to 
be potentially beneficial for many industries. Several companies have realized the 
value of AI technology. By building precise models, a company has a better chance 
of identifying profitable opportunities and avoiding risks. Machine learning tech­
niques are being applied in several sectors including government, healthcare, 
finance, retail, transportation, oil and gas, and manufacturing. Over the years, the 
manufacturing industry has exploited the use of artificial intelligence (AI), which is 
the intelligence exhibited by machines. The factors that make AI best suitable for 
manufacturing include [16]: virtual reality, automation, intelligence, prediction, and 
better products.
2.3  AI in Manufacturing
Manufacturing is regarded as a prime generator of wealth and is critical in establish­
ing a sound basis for economic growth. Globalization has radically changed the 
manufacturing process in recent years. The manufacturing industry has become 
2.3  AI in Manufacturing

18
 
14
more competitive due to globalization. To survive and indeed thrive, in the global 
competitive market, manufacturing enterprises should reduce the product cost and 
increase the productivity while not sacrificing performance, quality, durability, reli­
ability, availability, serviceability, aesthetics, feature, and conformance to standards 
and/or specifications.
Manufacturing consists of a set of processes, machines, and factories where raw 
materials are transformed into products. The search for new ways to increase effi­
ciency and productivity has always been at the heart of manufacturing. To meet 
these challenges, it is essential to utilize all means available. One area, which saw 
fast pace of developments in terms of not only promising results but also usability, 
is artificial intelligence. AI is one of the many technologies currently impacting 
manufacturing [17].
Manufacturing efficiency and maintaining product quality remain top priorities 
in some industries such as IC industry, where process and equipment reliability 
directly influence cost, throughput, and yield [14]. Recent developments have 
enabled AI to cross into the mainstream: cloud computing, big data, machine learn­
ing, and Internet of Things (IoT).
The manufacturing industry is now moving into the fourth industrial revolution:

•	 The first revolution introduced mechanization through water and steam power.
•	 The second revolution ushered in mass production and assembly lines using 
electricity.
•	 The third industrial revolution introduced the digital era, comprised of comput­
ers and automation.
•	 The fourth industrial revolution, referred to as “Industry 4.0,” is happening now.
2.3 19
2.4  Applications of AI in Manufacturing
The applications of artificial intelligence are everywhere, and its uses are constantly 
evolving. AI promises to be a game-changer at every facet of manufacturing and 
might help in solving some of its so far unsolvable problems. The techniques of AI 
in general, and machine learning (ML) in particular, have been a source of inspira­
tion for researchers in the manufacturing industry. We now present some applica­
tions of AI in manufacturing:

•	 Automotive Industry: The automotive industry covers a wide range of vehicles. 
The industry faces severe challenges at the moment due to the trend toward a 
connected, autonomous, and green individual mobility, which requires high 
investments. Deep learning has many potential applications in the automotive 
industry during development, manufacturing, and sales. It is also useful in 
advanced driving assistance systems, autonomous driving, and advanced detec­

tion controls. Although there are many automotive suppliers all over the world, 
they essentially follow the same procedure in their production [24, 25]. AI can 
help insurance companies in assessing risk as well as helping customers in filing 
their insurance claims. Predicting future trends can make a big difference in the 
automotive insurance sector.

•	 Predictive Manufacturing: Nearly all engineering systems are subject to failures 
due to deterioration or misuse. Instead of fixing things when failure happens, it 
is better to predict problems before they occur. Manufacturers have faced a com­
pelling need for the development of predictive models that predict mechanical 
failures or predict when maintenance is due. The central objective of applying AI 
and machine learning techniques to manufacturing systems is to accomplish the 
predictive manufacturing. This is a manufacturing system that has self-­awareness 
and can detect current conditions, diagnose a problem, and make a decision. This 
may also be regarded as predictive maintenance, which is able to predict disrup­
tions to the production line in advance of that disruption [22]. Data collected 
from sensors can be used to predict the failures and do preventive maintenance 
which is a lot cheaper than fixing problem situations after failure. Predictive 
manufacturing is required in order to realize the smart factory. The main benefit 
of AI-based predictive maintenance is accuracy and promptness.
•	 Semiconductor Manufacturing: This is a complex process that requires monitor­
ing a great number of parameters from production to the packaging. VLSI tech­
nology has advanced to the stage where the automation of semiconductor 
manufacturing has become imminent. Expert system technology can be applied 
to monitor various processes and equipment for the IC manufacturing environ­
ment. Machine learning is a useful tool in the automation of the IC manufactur­
ing process. It also serves as an aid to engineers in interpreting and assimilating 
experimental results [29]. Within the semiconductor wafer manufacturing pro­
cess, tight quality control is extremely important. Also, the volume of data in 
semiconductor manufacturing makes the data analysis difficult and time-­
consuming. Most semiconductor manufacturers keep a vast database to record 
every parameter in the manufacturing process. This online availability of vast 
2  Artificial Intelligence in Manufacturing

23
amounts of production data brings the need for automatic analysis tools, to which 
machine learning techniques are good candidates [30].
•	 Supply Chain Management: AI can be used to collect and monitor data along the 
supply chain and then manage inventory, predict future demand, and detect inef­
ficiencies. Artificial intelligence and machine learning make supply chain man­
agement not only automated but cognitive. The cognitive supply chain ensures 
data privacy and prevents hacking. Supply chain management systems based on 
AI algorithms can automatically analyze such data, define optimal solutions, and 
make data-driven decisions. Supply chain management is an example of how AI 
and big data can be used to the benefit of manufacturers.

•	 Predictive Maintenance: In predictive maintenance, data is collected overtime to 
monitor and find patterns to predict failures. Although predictive maintenance is 
applied in many industries, it thrives in manufacturing. AI in manufacturing has 
come a long way with technologies like predictive maintenance. Machine learn­
 
32
2.4  Applications of AI in Manufacturing

24
ing can be used to predict recommended schedules of preventative maintenance 
in order to improve worker safety, reduce costs, and achieve sustainability goals. 
The adoption of machine learning and deep learning in manufacturing will only 
improve predictive maintenance. Deep learning can aid in the predictive mainte­
nance of complex machinery and connected systems.
•	 Manufacturing Site Selection: The need for the development of the prototype 
expert system that enables optimal and efficient site selection comes from state 
or local planners, who must identify possible sites when asked by potential for­
eign manufacturing investors, who are looking for suitable locations for produc­
tion plants. Site selection is one of the most crucial decisions that industrial 
management has to make in considering establishment of a new plant.
Artificial intelligence is also used in additive manufacturing, digital manufactur­
ing, smart manufacturing, cellular manufacturing, flexible manufacturing, adaptive 
manufacturing, green manufacturing, manufacturing healthiness, furniture manu­
facturing, and “service part, maintenance, and reusable part” remanufacturing. AI 
has also found a niche in product design, generative design, process control, fluid 
power industry, tire industry, aerospace industry, food and beverage industry, ship-­
building industry, textile industry, steel industry, apparel industry, and construction 
industry.
2.5  Benefits
Artificial intelligence can help address some issues facing manufacturing, improve 
quality control, shorten design cycles, remove supply-chain bottlenecks, reduce 
materials and energy waste, and improve production yields. AI tools are helping 
manufacturers find new business models, improve their product quality, increase 
productivity, reduce chronic labor shortage, and optimize manufacturing opera­
tions, while finding new ways to retain employees. They can enhance and extend the 
capabilities of humans. Manufacturers can use AI systems to design smart products, 
forecast demand, ensure quality, and manage supply chain risk. Other benefits 
include [34]:
•	 Robotics: A large share of the manufacturing jobs is performed by robots. AI-­
powered robots can interpret CAD models, which eliminate the need to program 
their movements and processes. Industrial robots perform what they were pro­
grammed to do, but they cannot make complex decisions as humans.
•	 Higher Productivity: With the help of AI, manufacturing will realize higher pro­
ductivity, increase efficiency, and improve the way customers are served. AI is 
poised to impact the supply chain.
•	 Better Decisions: With the adoption of AI, manufacturers are able to make rapid, 
data-driven decisions, optimize manufacturing processes, and minimize opera­
tional costs. While machines cannot yet surpass human intelligence, they can 
2  Artificial Intelligence in Manufacturing

25
outperform humans in relation to speed, accuracy, and ability to search, sort, 
transform, interpret, and analyze vast amounts of information.
•	 Price Forecasts: Knowing the prices of resources is also necessary for compa­
nies when their products are ready to leave the factory. The system is able to 
provide accurate price recommendations.
•	 Customer Service: AI solutions can analyze the behaviors of customers to iden­
tify patterns and predict future outcomes. There are a number of AI tools that can 
improve customer service.
2.6  Challenges
The field of AI is broad and even confusing, presenting a challenge and hindering 
wide applications. Manufacturing is a high-cost venture for most businesses, and it 
requires considerable capital investments. It is possible for AI to develop a will of 
its own that may be in conflict with that of humans, especially when under the influ­
ence of clandestine or cryptic cyberattacks. The increasing use of connected tech­
nologies makes the manufacturing system vulnerable to cyberattacks [27]. Other 
challenges include [34]:
•	 Complexity: A major challenge is the ongoing trend of the manufacturing domain 
to becoming more complex and dynamic. Due to this challenge, modern manu­
facturing technology is interdisciplinary in nature.
•	 Common Fear: There is the common fear of human jobs being lost to AI. Mass 
unemployment will be a social challenge. This will require retraining human 
workers for new careers. With automation and increased deployment of AI tech­
nologies, it is conceivable that machines may outperform human workers in 
many areas of human technology-based endeavors.
•	 Environmental Impact: The manufacture of a variety of products may continue to 
damage the environment when there is disregard for design for environment and 
design for recyclability.
•	 Shortage in Workforce: Manufacturing companies will feel the challenge of a 
decreasing talent pool. There are not enough skilled people to perform the AI-­
related jobs of the future. There continues to be a shortage of AI-based techno­
logical know-how within the manufacturing workforce.
•	 Liability: AI raises important legal, ethical, and public policy questions. AI tech­
nology implementers or AI systems integrators will have to make potentially 
life-or-death decisions. How should a self-driving car decide between crashing 
itself and potentially killing its passengers? How do we assign liability for when 
AI-enabled and/or powered systems make mistakes?
2.6  Challenges

26
2.7  Global AI in Manufacturing
Artificial intelligence is gradually being implemented in almost every nation. In 
recent years, the global market has witnessed significant progress in technologies, 
industry, and applications in terms of manufacturing in general and intelligent man­
ufacturing in particular. With the inroading of artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet 
of Things (IoT) into the manufacturing sector, nations are inevitably faced with a 
number of policy concerns which need to be addressed at various levels keeping in 
mind the socioeconomic factors that influence policy making in that particular 
nation. For example, the United States and Germany have spared no effort in dem­
onstrating and promoting their development strategy to transform and upgrade their 
manufacturing industries.
The Global Manufacturing and Industrialization Summit (GMIS) was estab­
lished in 2015 to build bridges between manufacturers, governments and NGOs, 
technologists, and investors so that they can harness the transformative power of the 
Fourth Industrial Revolution. Here, we consider how AI is being applied in manu­
facturing in different countries [18, 35].
•	 United States: The leading manufacturing industries in the United States include 
steel, automobiles, chemicals, food processing, consumer goods, aerospace, and 
mining. Manufacturing technology in the United States has accomplished tre­
mendous outcomes. The Boeing Company and General Electric have identified 
challenges to the incorporation of AI in the manufacturing sector. The 
Manufacturing Institute and Deloitte estimate that the United States alone may 
have as many as 2.4 million manufacturing jobs to fill between now and 2028. 
Americans have not yet grappled with just how profoundly the artificial intelli­
gence (AI) revolution will impact our economy, national security, and welfare. 
We take seriously China’s ambition to surpass the United States as the world’s AI 
leader within a decade. The US Government is accelerating its commitment in AI 
techniques due to the fact that the manufacturing sector is ripe for accelerated 
growth [36].
•	 China: China is well known as the “manufacturing kingdom.” Manufacturing 
industry in China is facing a critical and historical moment in terms of the trans­
formation of the manufacturing giant to manufacturing power and from “made in 
China” to “created in China.” The industry is in a phase of imbalanced develop­
ment among different regions, industries, and enterprises, where mechanization, 
electrification, automation, and digitization coexist. The Chinese government 
has proposed strategic plans of “made in China 2025.” It sets the principles for 
becoming the second tier of the powerhouse in manufacturing: innovation-­
driven, quality first, environment-friendly development, structural optimization, 
and talent-centric innovations. The plan also includes the following nine mis­
sions: (1) increasing innovative capability in national manufacturing, (2) promot­
ing the deep fusion of information and industrialization, (3) strengthening the 
basic industry capacity, (4) booming the quality brand-building, (5) popularizing 
environment-friendly manufacturing, (6) advancing breakthroughs in key areas, 
2  Artificial Intelligence in Manufacturing

27
(7) pushing forward further the structural adjustment to the manufacturing indus­
try, (8) advancing services for manufacturing and production, and (9) increasing 
international involvement in manufacturing. The manufacturing industry in 
China is faced with imbalanced development among different regions, indus­
tries, and enterprises. The AI technology and its deployment are gradually chang­
ing the economy of the world in general and of China in particular [37].
•	 Germany: Germany mainly focuses on the research of underlying technologies 
for manufacturers, such as intelligent sensing, wireless sensor networks, and 
CPSs. Sensors will gather data from the engine during its flight and transmit it to 
the ground for smart analysis. The Germany Amberg factory is a model of an 
intelligent plant of the Siemens Company. At Amberg, the real factory is oper­
ated together with the virtual factory, and the real factory data and production 
environments are reflected by the virtual factory.
•	 India: The impact of AI on the manufacturing industry in India often depicts a 
picture of a stagnant job growth and even job loss. AI is disrupting traditional 
business models in the IT sector, the automotive industry, and other manufactur­
ing industries. However, smart manufacturing are picking up in India. The Indian 
Institute of Science is developing a smart factory. India, unlike its G20 counter­
parts, is yet to fully tap the available opportunities that AI presents.
2.8  Future of AI in Manufacturing
Global competition and continuously changing customer requirements are dictating 
increasing changes in manufacturing environments. AI in manufacturing is a game-­
changer. AI is already transforming manufacturing in several ways and also chang­
ing the way we design products. Today, manufacturing has a strong association with 
AI, especially in the use of automation. AI technologies in the manufacturing indus­
try are expected to grow over the next several years. There is an excellent future for 
use of AI in manufacturing due to the potentially high value-added prospects when 
applied successfully [36]. The future will witness a deep fusion of new AI technolo­
gies with Internet technologies. AI will have a fundamental impact on the global 
labor market in the next few years.
Today’s technologies are able to predict design successes, product performances, 
and equipment failures, providing key information that helps manufacturers con­
tinuously improve. AI algorithms formulate estimations of market demands by 
looking for patterns linking location, socioeconomic and macroeconomic factors, 
weather patterns, political status, consumer behavior, and more. This information is 
invaluable to manufacturers as it allows them to optimize staffing, inventory control, 
energy consumption, and the supply of raw materials.

2.8  Future of AI in Manufacturing

28
 
37
•	 Advanced Manufacturing: This is a family of activities that depend on the use 
and coordination of information, automation, computation, software, sensing, 
and networking. It uses cutting edge materials and emerging technologies such 
as nanotechnology and industrial IoT.  In order to capture the potential of 
advanced manufacturing and create new advantages, we must collaborate to 
bring these emerging technologies into the next generation. With artificial intel­
ligence, advanced manufacturing can become more autonomous, efficient, and 
profitable [38].
•	 Smart Manufacturing: Smart manufacturing (SM) is a term coined by several 
agencies in the United States and increasingly used globally. Other initiatives 
such as Industry 4.0, cyber-physical production systems, smart factory, intelli­
gent manufacturing, and advanced manufacturing are frequently used synony­
mously with smart manufacturing. SM is characterized by the integration of 
new-generation information communication technologies (ICT) in support of the 
manufacturing industry. Smart manufacturing, which is the fourth revolution in 
the manufacturing sector, has its own identity captured in the following six pil­
lars [39]: (1) data, (2) materials, (3) sustainability, (4) predictive engineering, (5) 
resource sharing and networking, (6) manufacturing technology and processes. 
Smart manufacturing will transform how products are designed, fabricated, 
operated, and used. Globalization and competitiveness are forcing companies to 
rethink and innovate their production process [32].
2  Artificial Intelligence in Manufacturing

29
•	 Additive Manufacturing: Additive manufacturing (AM) (or 3D printing or lay­
ered manufacturing or fused deposition manufacturing or laminated object man­
ufacturing) refers to a process by which 3D CAD data is used to construct an 
object in layers by depositing material. The promise of AM is the use of less 
material and to provide faster cycle time due to rapid prototyping. AM technolo­
gies typically include a computer, 3D modeling software (Computer Aided 
Design or CAD), a machine, and material. The AM machine reads in data from 
the CAD data file and develops successive layers of the material in a layer-upon-­
layer manner to fabricate the desired 3D object. Additive manufacturing allows 
one to produce the objects without machining, lathing, milling, grinding, boring, 
casting, or welding. It will take manufacturing to the next level. It will lead to 
home manufacturing [40].
•	 Explainable AI: This bridges the transparency and trust between AI technology 
and its consumers. Explainable AI in manufacturing improves efficiency, work­
place safety, and customer satisfaction using automation. It can save a manufac­
turing enterprise money and time by reducing and predicting machine 
breakdowns. To implement Explainable AI in our AI system requires obeying 
four principles: (1) Explanation: The system will provide a reason for each deci­
sion. The predictive maintenance system will tell when failure will occur and the 
need for maintenance or equipment replacement. (2) Meaningful: The explana­
tion that the system provides should be understandable to the targeted recipient. 
The developer needs to know how the system reaches its decision so that they 
can trust the system. (3) Explanation Accuracy: The explanations provided by 
the system should be accurate. If it generates the wrong output, then it is of no 
use. (4) Knowledge Limits: This prevents the system from giving an unjust and 
fallacious result. Hence, users can assure that the system will never mislead [41].
2.9  Conclusion
Artificial intelligence is changing the world and impacting our lives. AI deals with 
computational systems that imitate the intelligent behavior of experts. Considerable 
progress has been made in the application of AI in several aspects of manufacturing. 
For manufacturers considering introducing AI into their processes, it is important to 
define their goal from the outset. Manufacturers need to ask themselves where they 
want to use AI in the near, mid-, and long term.
AI is both a powerful source of game-changing technology disruption and a tool 
to gain highly leveraged competitive advantage.
AI technologies are still rapidly evolving, often causing uncertainty for compa­
nies around what their future IT architecture should look like. For manufacturers, AI 
promises to be a game-changer at every level of the value chain. AI technology is 
now making its way into manufacturing and could hold the key to transforming 
factories of the near future.
2.9  Conclusion

30
Without doubt artificial intelligence holds the key to future growth and success 
in manufacturing. The combination of manufacturing technology with information 
communication technology and smart technology is enabling a game-changing 
transformation in terms of manufacturing models and approaches. AI is poised to 
change the way we manufacture products and process materials forever. More infor­

Robotic Automation in Manufacturing
3.1  Introduction
The manufacturing sector represents the largest private industry in the United States. 
It is well-known to be a major contributor in both economic boom times and eco­
nomic recessions. To boost productivity, manufacturing companies turn to advanced 
technology such as robotic automation. Automation refers to any technology that 
reduces the need for human assistance. It essentially describes mechanization, 
machines replacing human labor, or human decision-making. It can have far-reach­
ing consequences in manufacturing.
Robotic automation has become one of the key areas for modern manufactur­
ing systems. It is applicable to virtually any industry imaginable, just as automo­
tive, electronics, food, and manufacturing. It is used in manufacturing to change 
the industrial landscape by increasing productivity, repeatability, and precision 
while protecting employees from unsafe working environments [1]. Automation 
can assist the manufacturing industry by reducing labor costs substantially; 
increasing quantity or generating more output for a given period of time; enhanc­
ing accuracy, repeatability, reliability, and safety; improving product quality; and 
mitigating risk.
Several economists believe employment in routine occupations has declined and 
automation is a wave of technological change that could lead to structural shifts in 
the labor market resulting in “job polarization.” One of the most important applica­
tion areas for deploying automation is manufacturing. The industrial revolution 
introduced the idea of using machines to increase production while reducing costs.
In recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the use of robots in manufactur­
ing [2]. Robots have changed manufacturing in a myriad of positive ways. Robotic 
automation introduces the idea of using machines or robots to increase production 
while lowering costs, reducing worker fatigue, and increasing precision, accuracy, 
repeatability, and safety.
Advances in automation, artificial intelligence and robotics, 
while increasing productivity, will also cause major upheavals 
to the workforce.

This chapter provides an introduction to the uses of robotic automation in manu­
facturing. It begins by describing what robots are. It gives an overview on automa­
tion. It describes different types of robots and how they are used in manufacturing. 
It highlights the benefits and challenges of using robots in manufacturing. It covers 
global adoption of robotic automation. The last section concludes with comments.
3.2  What Is a Robot?
The word “robot” was coined by Czech writer Karel Čapek in his play in 1920. The 
Russian writer Isaac Asimov coined the term “robotics” in 1942 and came up with 
three rules to guide the behavior of robots [3]:
	1.	 Robots must never harm human beings.
	2.	 Robots must follow instructions from humans without violating rule 1.
	3.	 Robots must protect themselves without violating the other rules.
The first robots had no external sensing and were used for simple tasks as pick 
and place. They replaced humans in monotonous, repetitive tasks, and they were 
deployed in dangerous work environments. Robotics has since advanced and taken 
many forms including fixed robots, collaborative robots, mobile robots, industrial 
robots, medical robots, police robots, military robots, officer robots, service robots, 
space robots, social robots, personal robots, and rehabilitation robots [4, 5]. Robots 
are becoming increasingly prevalent in almost every industry, from healthcare to 
manufacturing.

Robotics is a branch of engineering and computer science that involves the con­
ception, design, manufacture, and operation of robots. It is an interdisciplinary 
advanced technology field, embracing mechanical engineering, electrical engineer­
ing, computer science, biotechnology, nanotechnology, information technology, 
and robot technology. It may be regarded as one of the technologies used to design

and operate robots. The goal of robotics is to create intelligent machines (called 
robots) that behave and think like humans.
3.3  Overview on Automation
Automation refers to a wide range of technologies that reduce human intervention 
in processes. It has been achieved by various means including mechanical, hydrau­
lic, pneumatic, electrical, electronic devices, and computers. There are different 
types of automation including artificial neural network, human machine interface, 
robotic process automation, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), 
programmable logic controller (PLC), and robotics. Automation can also be classi­
fied as: (1) fixed automation, (2) programmable automation, and (3) flexible 
automation.
Robots exhibit varying degrees of autonomy. Autonomy means to be indepen­
dent and able to govern oneself. It is different from automation, which performs a 
sequence of highly structured preprogrammed tasks. Industrial autonomy is where 
plant assets and operations have learning and adaptive capabilities that allow 
responses with minimal human interaction. Some companies are transitioning from 
industrial automation to industrial autonomy.
The main advantages of automation are the following [8]:
•	 Increased throughput or productivity
•	 Improved product quality
•	 Increased predictability
•	 Improved robustness (consistency) of processes or product
3.3  Overview on Automation

36
•	 Increased consistency of output
•	 Reduced direct human labor costs and expenses
•	 Reduced cycle time
•	 Increased accuracy
•	 Relieving humans of monotonously repetitive work
•	 Required work in development, deployment, maintenance, and operation of 
automated processes—often structured as “jobs”
•	 Increased human freedom to do other things
The main disadvantages of automation are the following [8]:
•	 High initial cost.
•	 Faster production without human intervention which can mean faster unchecked 
production of defects.
•	 Scaled-up capacities which can mean scaled-up problems when systems fail.
•	 Human adaptiveness is often poorly understood by automation initiators.
•	 Workers anticipating employment income may be seriously disrupted by compa­
nies deploying automation.
•	 Current technology is unable to automate all the desired tasks.
•	 Many operations using automation have large amounts of invested capital and 
produce high volumes of product, making malfunctions extremely costly and 
potentially hazardous.
•	 As a process becomes increasingly automated, there is less and less labor to be 
saved or quality improvement to be gained.
•	 As more and more processes become automated, there are fewer remaining non­
automated processes.
To jump directly to autonomous operations is hard to achieve. The following 
levels of automation must be taken [9].
Level 0–1 Manual/Semi-automated: A facility is minimally instrumented and auto­
mated to improve productivity. Many operations are performed manually with 
paper-based instructions and record keeping.
Level 2 Automated: The automation system conducts majority of production pro­
cesses but requires human oversight and intervention.
Level 3 Semi-autonomous: It is characterized by a mixture of autonomous compo­
nents and automated assets with human orchestration. Companies at this level 
deploy a range of selective autonomous components or applications orchestrated 
by humans.
Level 4 Autonomous Orchestration: Most assets operate autonomously and are syn­
chronized to optimize production, safety, and maintenance. There is still a need 
for humans to perform many tasks.
Level 5 Autonomous Operations: A highly idealized state where facilities operate 
autonomously and require no human interaction.
Although perfect automation has never been realized, it has caused alterations in 
the patterns of employment.

3.4  Robotics in Manufacturing
Productivity, cost-efficiency, reliability, reduced dependency, and sustainability are 
some of the key factors driving the adoption of robotic automation in today’s manu­
facturing environment. Here are some types of robotic technology that have changed 
and will keep changing the manufacturing industry [10]:
	1.	 Collaborative Robots: These robots are designed to work collaboratively with 
people in manufacturing environments.
	2.	 Autonomous Mobile Robots: These robots can get around by themselves in man­
ufactory environment.
	3.	 Industrial Robots: These robots have strong arms that can handle massive pay­
loads in factories.
	4.	 Robots with Machine Vision: These robots use machine vision to help quality 
control workers and inspect parts.
	5.	 Robotic Blacksmithing: This manufacturing method uses a combination of spe­
cial tools, robotic arms, and sensors to reshape materials.
	6.	 Mobile Robots: Robots are either fixed or mobile. Mobile robots are designed for 
changing environments. They are not bolted to the floor as fixed robots.
	7.	 Articulated Robots: Articulated robots have rotary joints that allow for a full 
range of motion. They are industrial robots used in manufacturing for packing, 
painting, welding, and material handling.
These robots are evolving. They are growing in size, capability, and speed. The 
rapidly growing number of robots has been used for professional and personal ser­
vice applications.
Robots are used in manufacturing for the following reasons [11]:
	 1.	 To create and enhance efficiencies all the way from raw material handling to 
finished product packing.
	 2.	 They can be programmed to operate 24/7 in lights-out situations for continuous 
production.
	 3.	 Robotic equipment is highly flexible and can be customized to perform even 
complex functions.
	 4.	 Manufacturers increasingly need to use robotic automation to boost productiv­
ity and stay competitive.
	 5.	 Robotic automation can be highly cost-effective for nearly every size of 
company.
	 6.	 Any repetitive task is a candidate for robotic manufacturing. Robots protect 
workers from repetitive, mundane, and dangerous tasks.
	 7.	 Robots handle tiny parts too small for human eyes and never make mistakes.
	 8.	 Robots free up manpower to let companies maximize workers’ skills in other 
areas of the business. They create more desirable jobs, such as engineering, 
programming, management, and maintenance.
	 9.	 Robotic automation allows domestic companies to be price-competitive with 
offshore companies.
3.4  Robotics in Manufacturing

38
	10.	 Robots achieve ROI quickly, often within 2 years, offsetting their upfront cost.
Robots are used in manufacturing to perform different functions. The most com­
mon areas where robots are performing their jobs in the manufacturing process 
include [12]:
	1.	 Material Handling: Robots are being used to handle materials that require dan­
gerous product that could risk contamination if in contact with humans.
	 	
3.2 13
	3.	 Assembly: Having to assemble product parts is a long, repetitive job. By replac­
ing such a system with a robot significantly reduces error.
	4.	 Dispensing: For processes which require glue, paint, or sprays, dispensing robots 
are placed at a strategic point near the path of the product.
	5.	 Processing: There are certain products that have to undergo a specific type of 
processing, such as carving, polishing, or sawing, before being released. This 
task is done by robots with varying degrees of autonomy.

•	 Lights-Out Manufacturing: This is a production system with no human workers; 
machines handle the production process from beginning to end to eliminate labor 
costs. The “lights out” manufacturing concept is so called because robots can 
work without lights, do not need HVAC, coffee breaks, or days off and, indeed, 
do not need other conditions that human workers require. Lights-out manufactur­
ing allows robots to work without any interference. It became popular in 1982 
when General Motors replaced risk-averse bureaucracy with automation and 
robots. The expansion of lights-out manufacturing requires reliability of equip­
ment, preventive maintenance, and commitment from the staff. Companies that 
practice this manufacturing style can experience better energy efficiency [7].
•	 Automated Production Lines: Automating tedious and difficult tasks with robot 
revolutionized the manufacturing sector. Automation has been achieved through 
a combination of various means of technology and system integration including 
mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, electronic, and computers. Today, 
extensive automation is practiced in almost every type of manufacturing. 
Automated production line consists of a series of workstations connected by a 
transfer system to move parts between the stations. This is an example of fixed 
automation, since these lines are typically set up for long production runs. The

various operations and other activities taking place on an automated transfer line 
must all be sequenced and coordinated properly for the line to operate efficiently. 
Automated production lines are used in many industries, especially automotive 
industry [18].

•	 Accurate: RPA software is generally less prone to errors and function with 
high precision.
•	 Consistent: This software can produce error-free, consistent results.
3.5  Manufacturing Applications

21
•	 Cost Cutting Technology: RPA definitely reduces the manual workforce and 
hence reduces the cost used to perform any task.
•	 Productivity Rate: The execution time to perform any task is much faster 
when compared to the manual approach.
•	 Reduce Burden on IT: RPA software does not disturb the underlying legacy 
systems.
•	 Offers Compliance: RPA follows rules to prove audit-free trial so that you do 
not have to worry about the security of your automation.
•	 Reliable Software: This software is reliable, as robots can work 24/7 without 
a break.
•	 No/Less Coding Required: RPA software require a minimal level of program­
ming knowledge.

43
Other manufacturing sectors using robotic automation include food manufactur­
ing, forging, forming, shaping and blanking manufacturing industry, reshoring man­
ufacturing, and robot welding.
3.6  Benefits
Robots are evolving in ways many business professionals and production managers 
across the globe could only have dreamed of. Automation and robotics continue to 
influence our lives in many ways. They make manufacturing easier, more produc­
tive, and more efficient. The key objective of robotic automation is to improve 
worker safety, reduce costs, improve quality, and increase flexibility. Robotic auton­
omous operation is a means to achieve smart manufacturing goals. The advantages 
of robotics include the efficient execution of heavy-duty jobs with precision and 
repeatability. A robot increases speed for manufacturing processes by operating 
24/7, thereby increasing production while minimizing downtime. Other benefits of 
robotic automation include [19]:
	 1.	 Better Quality and Consistency: Robots can provide better production quality 
and more precise and reliable processes. They can increase productivity, effi­
ciency, and safety while delivering risk-reduction during process operation.
	 2.	 Maximum Productivity: Higher output and increased productivity have been 
two of the fundamental economic advantages commonly attributed to automa­
tion. The productivity of a process, which is greatly enhanced by robotic opera­
tions, is traditionally defined as the ratio of output units to the units of labor input.
	 3.	 Replacing Repetitive Tasks: A repetitive job can be better handled by a robot 
than a human worker simply due to lack of errors. Using robots for repetitive 
tasks means fewer risks of injury for workers.
	 4.	 Automation: By automating some manufacturing processes, labor is eliminated. 
Automation increases manufacturing productivity, economic competition, and 
education. It is also associated with improved quality, fewer errors, reduced 
safety instances, faster manufacturing production, and cheaper labor.
	 5.	 Reduced Direct Labor Costs: Replacing some workers with robots frees up 
workers so their skills and expertise can be used somewhere else. Reduction in 
labor increases profit, which is always a business goal imperative.
	 6.	 Addressing Challenges: Robots are helping manufacturers address many of the 
key challenges they face, including tight labor pools, global market competi­
tiveness, and safety.
	 7.	 Minimize Cost: Robotic automation is becoming increasingly flexible and intel­
ligent; the realization of which is minimizing cost per unit.
	 8.	 Increased Efficiency: In manufacturing, robots create efficiencies all the way 
from raw material handling to finished packaged product.
	 9.	 Programmable: Robots can be taught through programming to perform certain 
tasks, following a sequence of steps. They are getting smarter.
3.6  Benefits

44
	10.	 Longer work hours: Industrial robots work at a faster speed without fatigue or 
the need to take breaks or pauses.
3.7  Challenges
Like all things, robots come with pros and cons. There are still challenges of robotic 
automation that must be overcome. These challenges include [23]:
	 1.	 High initial investment: Robots typically require a large upfront investment. 
Manufacturing companies must be careful not to overcomplicate or overspend 
on their investment on robotic automation.
	 2.	 Expertise can be scarce: Deploying robot requires training and developing 
expertise. Industrial robots need sophisticated operation, maintenance, and pro­
gramming. The number of people with these skills is currently limited.
	 3.	 Ongoing costs: While industrial robots may reduce some manufacturing labor 
costs, they do come with their own ongoing expenses, such as maintenance.
	 4.	 Competition: Many manufacturers have been compelled to send jobs offshore 
to lower-wage manufacturing job jurisdictions, because they could not compete 
with low-cost foreign labor.
	 5.	 Labor: Robotic automation involves a replacement of human labor by an auto­
mated system. Workers have indeed lost jobs through automation.
	 6.	 Stress: A worker whose job has been replaced by robots goes through a period 
of emotional stress. The worker may need to relocate.
	 7.	 Limitations of Robots: Although robots remain an attractive alternative over 
human labor, there are still tasks that robots cannot perform. Robots depend 
upon their enabling systems, such as vision systems, grippers, conveyors, 
motion-sensor systems, and PLCs to complete tasks.
	 8.	 Robotic Integration: The benefits of integrating robotics into an organization’s 
production or manufacturing lines are endless. However, integrating robotics 
into a manufacturing system is a complex task. It requires judicious investment, 
predicated on calculating the risk and return tradeoffs and the implicit and 
explicit ROI and embracing changes based on both certain and uncertain 
limitations.
	 9.	 Societal Acceptance: The problem with robots is not just an issue of appropriate 
technology availability, choice, and insertion but also one of heavy dependence 
on societal acceptance, safety, and reliability as well as government regulations 
and industrial standardizations. Robots can be dangerous, and absolute safety is 
not guaranteed with their use. “Safe robots” should be built that do not harm 
workers in case of an accident or collision.
	10.	 Ethical Concerns: The legal and ethical barriers are high. Advances in robotic 
technology have social, legal, and ethical ramifications. Are robots primarily 
introduced to solve problems in manufacturing or replace humans in order to 
save money? Robots lack the capacity of moral reasoning. Ethical issues such 
as personal moral responsibility, privacy, and accountability are emerging con­
3  Robotic Automation in Manufacturing

45
cerning the use of robots. This suggests the need for developing robot ethics and 
examining the laws and regulations governing its use [24, 25].
3.8  Global Adoption of Robotic Automation
Industrial globalization of trade has increased and changed the manufacturing sec­
tor worldwide. The use of robots has expanded globally. Germany and Italy are 
ahead of the United States in terms of adoption of robot technology in production. 
The International Federation of Robotics (IFR) has robot immersion by industry 
and sector data for 13 industries within manufacturing and for 6 broad sectors out­
side of manufacturing. According to IFR, there were about 2,439,543 operational 
industrial robots by the end of 2017. We now consider how robotic automation is 
deployed in many countries.
•	 United States: As an area of critical importance to the United States and its econ­
omy, the manufacturing sector represents the largest of the United States’ private 
industry sectors. Robotics has made North American manufacturers globally 
competitive. The US auto industry employed 136 robots per thousand workers, 
while all other manufacturing industries in the United States employed only 8.6 
robots per thousand workers. Interest in robotics increased in the late 1970s, and 
many US companies entered the robotic system deployment wagon including 
General Electric and General Motors. Unemployment is becoming a serious 
social problem in the United States due to the exponential growth rate of automa­
tion and technological advances.
•	 China: This is the largest industrial robot market, with 154,032 units sold in 
2018. In China, which is a manufacturing hub due to cheap labor, most factories 
have replaced half of their workforce with robots.
•	 Japan: FANUC, a leading robot manufacturer in Oshino, Japan, has a 22-factory 
complex where they use the lights-out manufacturing concept to build their 
products. Industrial robots are supervised by a staff of only four workers per 
shift. In Japan, trials have demonstrated that robots can reduce the time required 
to harvest strawberries by up to 40 percent.
•	 Canada: The Canadian advanced manufacturing sector includes the fields of 
robotics, 3D printing, and ICT technologies. Canada facilitates the seamless inte­
gration of Industry 4.0 solutions into manufacturing operations [26].
3.9  Conclusion
Robots are all around us and their uses are increasing every day. They are taking 
over the world. They are designed to perform a wide variety of programmed tasks. 
Manufacturing and robotics are an inextricably tied, indissolubly bound, and natu­
rally collaborating duo. They hold great promise and are a key to projected rapid, 
3.9  Conclusion

sustained growth in industrial productivity. Robots are rapidly changing the face of 
manufacturing. They may help manufacturers increase precision, repeatability, and 
productivity. Today, manufacturing robots are more affordable than ever before.
Every manufacturer can benefit from employing robots.
The manufacturing industry is constantly changing. The future of manufacturing 
is becoming brighter, yet sophisticated, due to the various challenges manufacturers 
face and several mind-blowing devices and technologies in the horizon that would 
be available for insertion.
In the future, as demand for goods continues to grow, these robots may become 
more common on manufacturing floors. Their cost as well as the cost of adoption 
will fall. Future generations of robots are likely to offer higher levels of precision. 
Without a doubt, robots will play a pivotal role in the future of manufacturing. More 
information about robotic automation can be found in the books in [27–35], on a

Smart Manufacturing
4.1  Introduction
Traditionally, manufacturing has been regarded as the process of converting raw 
materials into finished product. It is essential for realizing all future products and is 
an indispensable element of the innovation chain. The manufacturing industry 
includes many sectors such as chemical industry, metal machinery industry, and 
electronics industry. Manufacturing has gone through transformations and become 
more automated, computerized, connected, and sophisticated.
Traditional manufacturing companies currently face several challenges such as 
rapid technological changes, inventory problems, shortened innovation span, short 
product life cycles, volatile demands, low prices, highly customized products, and 
the ability to compete in the global markets. The increasing impact on the manufac­
turing industry of Information Communication Technologies (ICT), encompassing 
the internet, computers, hardware and software, wireless networks, cell phones, 
middleware, modems, routers, repeaters, video-conferencing, social networking, 
and many other media applications and services. Digital technologies are leading to 
the development of new methods and tools that support the adoption of new produc­
tion and product development technologies. The manufacturing system is moving 
toward a more reliable and intelligent direction and end. The future of manufactur­
ing is geared toward producing customer-specific products ensuring short product 
life cycles, quick delivery times, zero defect production, and resource-efficient 
manufacturing [1]. The features can be achieved by smart manufacturing, which is 
also known as intelligent manufacturing. Due to environmental and resource limita­
tion, smart manufacturing seems to be the only way to improve the level of produc­
tivity, quality, reliability, safety, and serviceability of manufacturing systems.
Select and innovative technologies are transforming the manufacturing industry. 
In particular, smart manufacturing (SM) has gained significant impetus as a break­
through technological development that can transform the landscape of 
No country is ever successful in the long term... without a really 
strong and vibrant manufacturing base.

manufacturing today and tomorrow. It aims to take advantage of advanced informa­
tion and manufacturing technologies to enable flexibility in physical processes to 
address a dynamic and global market. It is becoming the focus of global manufac­
turing transformation and upgrading [2].
This chapter provides an introduction to smart manufacturing variously referred 
to as the smart factory. It begins by covering traditional manufacturing. Then it 
introduces the concept and characteristics of smart manufacturing. It discusses the 
goals of smart manufacturing and its enabling technologies. It provides some appli­
cations of SM, devotes a section to smart factory, presents some benefits and chal­
lenges on SM, and covers the global adoption of SM. The last section concludes 
with comments.
4.2  Overview of Traditional Manufacturing
Manufacturing started from a small-scale production line of crafts in 1800s. It has 
today evolved into large-scale mass production. The 2000s is the era when comput­
erized and personalized manufacturing systems came into existence for mass pro­
duction lines [3]. Manufacturing is typically a series of processes comprising 
selection of raw materials, production of objects, assembling of parts, inspection, 
and dispatching [4]. It may include foundry, forging, joining, welding, grinding, 
milling, turning cutting, boring, rolling, forming, abrading, polishing, electropolish­
ing, deburring, masking, ion-implantation, heat treatment, painting, etc. It involves 
using shop floor resources to meet the delivery date, cost, quality, and optimal eco­
nomic goals in limited resources condition. It often involves mass production and 
heavy energy consumption resources such as coal or electricity.
The traditional or current manufacturing processing techniques consume lots of 
energy, mainly for production and utility. They also produce a lot of pollution and 
add to the deterioration of the global environment. Because of this, manufacturers 
are gradually transforming their manufacturing systems from traditional mass pro­
duction to flexible lean systems. With rapid changes in technology, manufacturing 
itself is constantly transforming and evolving [5]. It now takes a proactive role in the 
development of cleaner manufacturing processes. In order to minimize the environ­
mental damage due to manufacturing, there is a need for new manufacturing process.
In modern times, two types of manufacturing systems have emerged emphasiz­
ing waste minimization. They are “lean” manufacturing systems and “green” manu­
facturing systems that both reduce waste. Lean manufacturing seeks to eliminate all 
types of wastes generated within a production system. In lean manufacturing, there 
are eight categories of waste that should be monitored [6]: (1) overproduction, (2) 
waiting, (3) inventory, (4) transportation, (5) over-processing, (6) motion, (7) 
defects, and (8) workforce. Green manufacturing (GM), also known as environmen­
tally conscious manufacturing, refers to modern manufacturing that makes products 
without pollution. It addresses a wide range of environmental and sustainability 
issues including resource selection, transportation, manufacturing process, and 
4  Smart Manufacturing

pollution. It is an effective way to protect resources and the environment and con­
serve the resources for future generation.
4.3  Concept of Smart Manufacturing
Recent advances in the field of technology have led to the emergence of innovative 
solutions known as smart technologies. A technology is considered smart if it per­
forms a task that an intelligent person can do. A smart or intelligent technology is a 
self-operative and corrective system that requires little or no human intervention. 
Smart technologies can be understood as a generalization of the concept of smart 
structures and the use of digital and communications technologies. They have given 
users new, powerful tools to work with. Today, we are in an era where everything is 
expected to be smart. Common examples include smart cities, smart factory, smart 
agriculture, smart farming, smart healthcare, smart university, smart medication, 
smart water, smart food, smart materials, smart devices, smart phones, smart grid, 
smart energy, smart homes, smart buildings, smart metering, smart appliances, 
smart equipment, smart heating controls, smart lighting systems, smart watch, smart 
economy, smart environment, smart grids, smart transportation, smart mobility, 
smart manufacturing, smart living, smart environment, smart people, etc. These 
technologies will ensure equity and fairness and lead to the realization of a better 
society and quality of life [7].
Today, manufacturers are facing the challenges of shortened product lifecycle, 
increasing customer-oriented value, global competition, and sustainable develop­
ment. Smart manufacturing (SM) is envisioned as a good approach to tackling these 
challenges. It may be regarded as an integration of multiple users, multiple systems, 
and multiple technologies of information processing. It is expected to have the abili­
ties to assist in decision-making, to adapt to new situations, and correct fabrication 
problems in a dynamic manufacturing environment.

Smart manufacturing will transform traditional manufacturing from cost opera­
tions into added-values operations and increase competitiveness. It is a value-­
creation process from design to production, logistics, and service. Through SM, 
manufacturing is shifting from knowledge-based intelligent manufacturing to data-­
driven and knowledge-enabled smart manufacturing [10]. In SM systems, data ana­
lytics plays an important role in turning data into valuable insights to assist 
decision-making.

Smart manufacturing often involves making available the right data in the right 
form, for the right people with the right knowledge, the right technology and the 
right operations. Thus, smart manufacturing system covers four areas [14, 15]:
4.4  Characteristics of Smart Manufacturing

54
	1.	 Smart Parts: The sensor technique is applied to the components so that they can 
have self-sensing capability of sensing temperature and vibration to improve 
reliability and service life.
	2.	 Smart Machine: This collects information on the operating status of various 
parts of the machine, conduct big data analysis, detect abnormalities as early as 
possible.
	3.	 Smart Production Line: The machines on the production line can communicate 
and support each other to increase the production efficiency.
	4.	 Smart Factory: This is linked with consumer needs and provides customized 
services. The Internet is used to link the management systems between factories 
to control the production schedule of products at linked or cooperating machin­
ing centers.
4.5  Goals of Smart Manufacturing
Modern manufacturing industry seeks to improve competitiveness through the con­
vergence with cutting-edge ICT technologies. Smart manufacturing is the collection 
of technologies that support effective and accurate engineering decision-making in 
real time [16]. The main goals of smart manufacturing are as follows: to foster tech­
nological and economic growth, build a customer-awareness and agile platforms, 
make resources available when they are needed, create the required skilled and 
trained workforce, improve safety and sustainability in the manufacturing industry, 
reduce energy use and waste streams from manufacturing plants, and enable seam­
less interoperation of manufacturing automation equipment from different vendors 
allowing plug-and-play configurations [17].
Applying the SM concept to the future smart factory may require equipping it 
with robots, advanced sensors, and intelligent machine. The improved SM pro­
cesses will handle and manage more operational complexity [18].
Several groups have been formed to advance smart manufacturing, with the most 
prominent being the Smart Manufacturing Leadership Coalition (SMLC), Industry 
4.0, and the Industrial Internet Consortium. These groups comprise industry, aca­
demic, and government partners [19].
4.6  Enabling Technologies
The implementation of the smart manufacturing/factory is enabled by several tech­
nologies such as artificial intelligence, industrial robots, embedded systems, RFID, 
sensor networks, wireless connectivity, machine learning, big data, cloud comput­
ing, cyber physical system (CPS), blockchain, human-machine interaction (HMI), 
augmented reality (AR), 3D printing, digital twin, and the Internet of things (IoT) 
4  Smart Manufacturing

55
or industrial Internet of things (IIoT). Thus, smart manufacturing enabling tech­
nologies include [20] the following:
	1.	 Cyber-physical system (CPS) is a key technology for smart manufacturing. CPS 
consists of physical entities (such as machines, vehicles, and work pieces), 
which are equipped with technologies such as RFIDs, sensors, microprocessors, 
telematics, or embedded systems. The Internet of things (IoT) is essentially the 
connection of machines, devices, and “things” wirelessly. IoT allows devices to 
be monitored and controlled remotely over the communication network. It has 
shown great potential in device communication, connections, and data collec­
tion, thereby laying a solid foundation for cyber–physical integration.
	2.	 Sensors: Ubiquitous sensing technologies include radio frequency identification 
(RFID), auto ID, virtual reality, GPS, and Wi-Fi. A regular sensor can be con­
verted into a ubiquitous sensor by connecting a networking module to it. The 
sensors (temperature, vibration, force, etc.) are used to monitor manufacturing 
processes.
	3.	 RFID: Manufacturing resources like machines, materials, and personnel are 
equipped with RFID devices and they become smart manufacturing objects. 
RFID technology enables real-time traceability, visibility, and interoperability in 
improving the performance of shop-floor planning, execution, and control of 
manufacturing systems.
	4.	 Robots: Industrial mobile robots are used in handling and transporting materials. 
This is appropriate for smart factory due to their flexibility and ability to com­
municate. Robots get the data from sensors and change their action accordingly. 
Robots with AI capability make it possible to involve the perception-based 
decision-­making which otherwise was not possible by rule-based algorithms 
in robots.
	5.	 IoT: There is huge potential for IoT and IIoT in smart manufacturing. IoT allows 
any individual object or device to be connected to the Internet. It is a link between 
objects in the real world with the virtual world, thereby enabling anytime, any­
where connectivity for anything. Major forces driving IoT in smart manufactur­
ing are the growing need for centralized monitoring and predictive maintenance 
of manufacturing infrastructure. While the IoT affects transportation, healthcare, 
or smart homes, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) refers in particular to 
industrial environments. IIoT refers to the application of IoT across several 
industries such as manufacturing, logistics, oil and gas, transportation, energy/
utilities, chemical, aviation, and other industrial sectors. This killer application 
is poised to revolutionize the world.
	6.	 3D printing: Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing, is one of 
the most revolutionary technologies in the history of manufacturing. It is basi­
cally used in rapid prototyping. This layer-by-layer production technology is 
rapidly finding an increased number of applications in manufacturing.

4.7  Applications
Manufacturing has evolved and become more automated, computerized, connected, 
and complex. It is an emerging form of production integrating manufacturing assets 
of today and tomorrow. Some typical applications of smart manufacturing include 
the following:
•	 Chemical Industry: The chemical industry can apply smart manufacturing for 
chemicals production optimized to have targeted final-use properties requested 
by the customer. For the chemical process industry, smart manufacturing should 
not only maximize economic competitiveness but also significantly reduce acci­
dent occurrences, while conversely enhancing safety compliance records and 
experiences.

•	 Energy System: Fuel cell vehicles utilize onboard stored hydrogen to produce 
onboard electricity to power the electric motors. The Department of Energy 
(DOE) has set some targets for onboard hydrogen storage, which includes a limit 
on the operating temperature and refuel rate of the hydrogen storage system. 
Smart manufacturing technologies can be adopted to address the operational 
challenges in the onboard hydrogen storage in metal hydride cells.
•	 Smart Machining. In smart manufacturing, the deployment of smart machining 
can be achieved with the help of smart robots and various other types of smart 
sensorized objects that are capable of real-time sensing. CPS-enabled smart 
machine tools are used for producing products. For example, CPS-enabled smart 
machine tools can capture the real-time data so that machine tools and their ser­
vices could be synchronized to provide smart manufacturing solutions. Various 
sensors and data acquisition devices are deployed in the machine tools to collect 
real-time machining data [25].
Other applications include automotive industry, smart monitoring, smart control, 
the blade smart manufacturing system, smart resin transfer molding systems, and 
prediction of the healthiness of the smart manufacturing line. These applications are 
just the tip of the iceberg. New applications are likely to emerge when value chains 
are fully linked to smart factories.
4.7  Applications

58
4.8  Smart Factory
While manufacturing may be regarded as a process that turns raw materials into 
physical value-added products, the factory is the structure where the manufacturing 
occurs. In traditional factories, the communication between a product and the differ­
ent operators that act on the value chain is usually slow and inefficient. There is also 
a lack of traceability of the product in traditional factories. Smart systems, together 
with the Industry 4.0 paradigm, provide alternatives to tackle the issues [26].
A smart factory is a highly digitized and connected production facility that relies 
on smart manufacturing. It can integrate data from system-wide physical, opera­
tional, and human assets to drive manufacturing, maintenance, and inventory track­
ing. This results in a more efficient, agile, responsive, proactive, and predictive system.
The manufacturing sectors with the support of the government are working hard 
to secure their market share through inventions toward the fourth industrial revolu­
tion known as Industrie 4.0, which was coined by the German government in 2011 
[27]. Industry 4.0 is enabled by the Internet and designed for improving the way 
modern factories operate through the use of the latest technologies. According to the 
architecture of Industry 4.0, the product lifecycle covers the smart product design, 
smart production, smart manufacture, smart logistic, smart marketing, and smart 
maintenance and service [28]. The smart factory is a manufacturing concept that 
provides efficient, flexible, and adaptive production solutions in a world of increas­
ing complexity. Currently, the smart factory is regarded as the factory of the future.

The structure of a smart factory can include a combination of production, infor­
mation, and communication technologies. Central to the smart factory is the tech­
nology that makes data collection possible. These include the intelligent sensors, 
motors, and robotics. The defining features of a smart factory are connectivity, 
autonomy, optimization, transparency, proactivity, and agility [30].
•	 Connectivity: Smart factories require the operations, processes, and materials to 
be connected to generate the data necessary to make real-time decisions. The 
entire factory system is connected with a network of sensors, switches, motors, 
etc. The connected production facility relies on smart manufacturing. Each facil­
4  Smart Manufacturing

ity is linked to the others and to the entire enterprise both within the factory and 
beyond. Connectivity enables providing information at all industrial plant levels.
•	 Autonomy: Factory units are becoming more and more automated since it saves 
labor and material. The automation includes factory floors and robots working 
24/7. Smart factories take this simple automation much further and are able to 
run without much human intervention. The Internet of things (IoT) standards (or 
the industrial IoT) will facilitate automation, allowing machines to communicate 
with machines in any sector. The connectivity and automation increase efficiency 
and productivity.
•	 Optimization: An optimized smart factory allows operations to be executed with 
minimal human intervention. Smart factory creates an environment where 
machinery and equipment can improve processes through automation and 
self-optimization.
•	 Transparency: A transparent network enables greater visibility and ensures that 
the organization can make more accurate decisions.
•	 Proactivity: In a proactive system, employees and systems can anticipate and act 
before problems arise. The ability of the smart factory to predict future outcomes 
can improve productivity, quality, and safety. The factory of tomorrow will be a 
proactive, responsive, and self-healing system.
•	 Agility: Agile flexibility allows the smart factory to adapt to schedule and pro­
duction changes with minimal intervention. The agility of future smart factories 
in terms of a continuous reconfiguration leads to dynamically changing product 
traffic flows in the factory.
4.8  Smart Factory

60
 
28
The implementation of smart factory solutions makes sustainable production 
attainable which in turn tackles global manufacturing challenges. The essential 
requirements for implementing the smart factory concept include the following [31]:
•	 Interoperability: It is important to communicate efficiently using IoT.
•	 Virtualization: It is essential in order to control physical processes by CPS and 
create a virtual copy of the physical world. Software-defined networking (SDN) 
and network virtualization can help to solve the challenges of future factory 
networking.
•	 Decentralization: It is required due to the soaring demand for customized prod­
ucts, which hinders centralized control and product management.
•	 Real-Time Capability: This concerns the need for collecting and analyzing infor­
mation in real time.

4.9  Benefits
Today, manufacturing is getting smart. Smart manufacturing (SM) will transform 
how products are designed, fabricated, operated, and used. It has the potential to 
address some of the challenges facing manufacturing enterprises. Potential benefits 
of smart manufacturing include cost reduction, production flexibility, shorter prod­
uct times-to-market, energy efficiency, environmental impact reduction, increased 
productivity, and quality gains. SM can revitalize the industrial sector by facilitating 
global competitiveness, providing sustainable jobs, radically improving perfor­
mance, and facilitating manufacturing innovation. SM technologies can help 
4  Smart Manufacturing

61
manufacturers and designers to create highly differentiated, cost-effective, and 
competitive products that meet today’s market needs while delighting the custom­
ers. SM promotes energy and environmentally efficient production. With the short­
age of engineers today and the pressure to maintain a competitive edge, SM can 
help deliver the right products, at the right cost, at the right time to the right custom­
ers and the right locations. It can make the industry more efficient, profitable, and 
sustainable, reduce energy usage, produce zero incidents, and enhance faster tech­
nology and product adoption. Through increased efficiency of labor and materials, 
creating new jobs, and having more reliable results, most companies using SM will 
see an return on investment (ROI) on their investments within a short period of time 
[33]. With time, smart manufacturing will only get smarter, faster, and more effi­
cient. Other benefits include the following:
•	 The investment of constructing a smart factory benefits manufacturers by creat­
ing a safer and more reliable plant.
•	 Smart factories reduce dependence on human labor and the evolving roles of 
employees.
•	 Lower costs and an enhanced customer experience. Employees should be willing 
to keep on developing their skills.
•	 Real-time visibility creates the flexibility to mobilize the supply chain to meet 
peak demand.
•	 Although smart factories produce physical goods, they also generate data and 
analytics as well, that could be useful in revealing the amounts of waste, and the 
excessive usage of electricity and water, thus paving the way for more responsi­
ble manufacturing resources management.
•	 Improve safety and security of the entire smart manufacturing complex.
•	 Increase productivity and intelligence associated with the smart manufacturing 
organization.

4.9  Benefits

62
4.10  Challenges
Smart manufacturing offers both benefits and challenges. Unfortunately, many 
manufacturing organizations are not fully aware of what SM is really about and its 
relevance to their organizations. Perhaps the most glaring challenge facing smart 
manufacturing is the risk of a cyberattack. Security must play a major role in the 
development of future smart manufacturing systems. A major bottleneck in smart 
manufacturing is achieving the communication and interaction between the physi­
cal and virtual spaces of manufacturing. SM technologies cannot be adopted inde­
pendently. The workforce skills gap generated by a more-connected manufacturing 
system must be addressed and given a top human resources management and train­
ing priority in companies planning to adopt SM. Smart manufacturing also critically 
depends on the right sets of policies in order to flourish. These policies are deter­
mined over time by governmental and non-governmental organizations catering to 
the analysis of smart manufacturing systems information. Successful smart manu­
facturing requires standards for developers and users. The use of standards in the 
manufacturing environment is essential for creating repeatable processes and reli­
able systems.
Creating environmentally sustainable manufacturing is the key challenge for 
smart factories of the future. The high interconnectivity of the smart factory makes 
the impacts of critical infrastructure breakdowns to be substantial. The idea of 
adopting or implementing a smart factory can appear complicated or insurmount­
able. By starting small with manageable smart systems and components and slowly 
growing, the promise of the smart factory can become a reality. Some old factories 
cannot face challenges in keeping up with ever-shifting trends. For the full promise 
of smart manufacturing to be realized, these challenges must be addressed.
4.11  Global Adoption of Smart Manufacturing
Smart manufacturing has been a topic of global interest among practitioners, strate­
gists, academicians, and governments. It has been widely recognized as a ground­
breaking manufacturing trend that will revolutionize modern manufacturing 
industries. With the fast development of the global economy, the manufacturing 
industry is going through a tremendous revolution in both developed and develop­
ing nations. The manufacturing sector worldwide is increasingly becoming auto­
mated and digitized. Various governments have proposed SM initiatives to facilitate 
the development of their own manufacturing industries and issued their national 
advanced manufacturing development strategies. Many large companies from the 
United States, Japan, Korea, and European countries have initiated collaborative 
efforts on the future of manufacturing and have started to adopt SM. Small- and 
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (also known as Smart Laundry Services) are still 
4  Smart Manufacturing

63
struggling with developing an SM investment portfolio. We now consider how the 
following nations have adopted smart manufacturing [35–40].
•	 United States: The United States is making concerted effort to advance innova­
tion policies that will encourage the development of new technologies. These 
policies promote the application of modern information technologies which 
drive the development of smart manufacturing. The manufacturing sector has a 
large footprint in the US economy. However, there is a noticeable lack of coordi­
nation among the various federal departments and agencies engaged in informa­
tion governance issues. In the United States, the Smart Manufacturing Leadership 
Coalition (SMLC) facilitates the broad adoption of manufacturing intelligence. 
Ohio is regarded as the nation’s third largest manufacturing state, with heavy tie 
with the automotive industry.
•	 Germany: Germany may be a trailblazer when it comes to smart manufacturing, but 
signals are mixed. The German government promotes the computerization of manu­
facturing industries in their “Industrie 4.0” initiative, which is increasingly affecting 
European policy. The national goal is to create an industrial sector with the ability to 
compete in the global market. While its automotive industry is its powerhouse, beef­
ing up research and development on electric and hybrid vehicles, Germany is vul­
nerable to global economic uncertainty and trade tensions. Volkswagen plans on 
becoming the first auto company to deploy 3D printing at scale. Daimler and BMW 
are jointly investing heavily in ride-sharing, autonomous vehicles.
•	 United Kingdom: Manufacturing is regarded as a moneymaker for the United 
Kingdom. British engineering and manufacturing industries have been in the 
vanguard of change. Manufacturing is strategic for the future strength and resil­
ience of the UK economy. Many UK manufacturing companies are world class. 
Manufacturing leads other sectors in many areas such as productivity, exports, 
and R&D. UK manufacturing needs to evolve in order to maintain international 
competitiveness and promote economic, social, and environmental sustainabil­
ity. The concept of the Factory of the Future (Factory 2050) provides a focus for 
manufacturing research. This brings into the purview some industries such as 
aerospace, automotive, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals, while placing out-of-­
scope industries such as food, beverages, tobacco, and publishing.
•	 China: China’s top-down approach stand in stark contrast to the US market-­
driven approach. Although China’s manufacturing industry is experiencing rapid 
development, most companies operate at industrial levels 2.0 and 3.0. In order to 
enhance innovation and productivity in the manufacturing industry, Made in 
China 2025 and Internet plus manufacturing are issued by the Chinese govern­
ment. Smart manufacturing is listed in the five major projects and nine key tasks 
proposed in the plan.
•	 India: Only 28% of the Indian manufacturing industry has an implemented smart 
factory. A key enabler of connected factories in India is the Government’s Make 
in India initiative, which aims to develop the country as the factory of the world 
and create highly skilled jobs in the sector. Some question whether the Indian 
infrastructure is ready for smart manufacturing and whether it is equipped with

the skills required to adapt to these evolving advanced technology concepts. A 
real breakthrough in smart manufacturing will come when the SMEs in India 
start partnering with IoT platform startups that enable higher efficiency. India 
must invest in R&D and in a highly trained and skilled workforce.
4.12  Conclusion
A sweeping revolution in manufacturing systems is underway in many developed 
countries. Manufacturing is no longer just about making physical products, it is 
beginning to make legacy systems more intelligent or smart. Manufacturing is 
evolving in many developed nations to become smart, more automated, digitalized, 
computerized, and complex.
Smart manufacturing is here to stay and it continues to evolve. It is a key compo­
nent of the broader thrust toward Industry 4.0. It is the marriage of advanced manu­
facturing capabilities with digital productivity, quality, safety leveraging, smart 
manufacturing technologies. Smart manufacturing is regarded as a transformative 
technology with a high degrees of sensorized and intelligent automation. 
Competitiveness considerations demand participation in manufacturing planning 
and control innovations. Smart factories link sensorized digital technologies with 
smart production processes. Manufacturers today are characterized by the ability to 
fulfill orders on demand by doing business through short-term networks where they 
negotiate value-adding processes dynamically.
Modern manufacturing systems require timely and efficient production tasks. 
Almost all aspects of manufacturing will need to change as the industry transitions 
to become fully digital. Smart manufacturing systems will ultimately transform 
product manufacturing, customization, and delivery. They can optimize the entire 
business processes and operation procedure of manufacturing with the goal of 
achieving higher levels of productivity and quality gains. In order to retain and 
attract workers with the right skills, to support smart manufacturing, manufacturers 
are providing leadership training, advanced technology skills training, and employee 
performance management immersion exposures.
The future of first rate-smart manufacturing is indissolubly bound with the smart 
factory innovation. Companies that are slow to adopt SM technologies could be left 
behind. More information on smart manufacturing and the smart factory can be

Industry 4.0
5.1  Introduction
The manufacturing industry is crucial to any nation’s economy because it pro­
foundly impacts economic and societal progress. It is the main driver of research, 
innovation, productivity, wealth creation, job opportunities, and export that supports 
a favorable international balance of trade position and the prestige and business 
advantages that go along with it. Manufacturing companies in all nations are facing 
an urgent need to improve quality, boost productivity, lower cost, and have quick 
customer services. To meet these challenges, the manufacturing industry needs to 
promote technological innovation and complete manufacturing, business, techno­
logical, and military intelligence upgrading.
The traditional manufacturing system basically includes two major parts: humans 
and physical systems. Manufacturing technology progressed from Henry Ford’s 
assembly line to computerization. Gradually, physical systems replace humans by 
taking over the majority of work. The transformation of the manufacturing industry 
from traditional manufacturing to new-generation manufacturing is a process of 
evolution [1]. Today, most of the manufacturing systems are changing rapidly in 
terms of the adoption of new, emerging technologies. Emerging technologies have 
raised the levels of digitalization, networking, and intelligence in the manufacturing 
industry. Recently, industrial technology has undergone profound changes, leading 
to “Industry 4.0” era.
Industry 4.0 (or I4.0) has been introduced recently as the trend toward digitiza­
tion and automation of the manufacturing sector. It is the convergence of digital and 
physical technologies disrupting the manufacturing industry, which is resulting in 
the blurring of boundaries between the physical, digital, and biological worlds. 
Industry 4.0 is the convergence of nine digital industrial technologies: advanced 
robotics, additive manufacturing, augmented reality, simulation, horizontal/vertical 
integration, cloud, cybersecurity, big data analytics, and the industrial Internet [2, 3]. 
The Fourth Industrial Revolution is not about new Apps or new 
technologies. It is about a new era, new ways of thinking and 
new ways of doing business.

The term 4IR, coined in 2016 by Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of 
the world economic forum, author of the book Fourth Industrial Revolution, is pre­
ceded by the German Government sponsorship of “Industrie 4.0” project to promote 
the computerization of manufacturing in 2011, which term is now synonymous with 
the term Industry 4.0 [4, 5]. It focuses on creating intelligent or smart environment 
within the production system. For essential emphasis, the emerging technologies 
giving rise to Industry 4.0 include cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things, cloud 
computing, augmented reality, edge computing, big data, predictive analytics, intel­
ligent robots, 3D printing, genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, industrial inte­
gration, and other contemporary and contributory revolutionary technologies. These 
technologies are poised to transform manufacturing around the globe.
Although Industry 4.0 is a manufacturing initiative, it has been involved in smart 
transportation and logistics, smart buildings, oil and gas, smart healthcare, and 
smart cities, to name a few. This trend of the Industry 4.0 affects people and pro­
cesses throughout the society, redefining family life, globalization, markets, etc. 
Industry 4.0 enables the digitalization of the manufacturing sector with built-in 
sensing devices virtually in all manufacturing components, products, and equip­
ment. It is the current trend in automation and data exchange in manufacturing 
organizations [2].
This chapter provides a brief introduction to Industry 4.0. It begins by covering 
the four industrial revolutions leading to Industry 4.0. It provides an overview on the 
concept of Industry 4.0. It describes the design principles and characteristic features 
of Industry 4.0.
It gives some of the applications of Industry 4.0. It highlights some benefits and 
challenges facing Industry 4.0. It covers the global adoption of I4.0. The last section 
concludes with comments.
5.2  Industrial Revolutions
The following industrial revolutions led to Industry 4.0 [6, 7].
•	 The first industrial revolution: The revolution happened between the late 1700s 
and early 1800s. It witnessed the transition from handmade agricultural produc­
tion to mechanical large-scale factory production in the nineteenth century.
•	 The second industrial revolution: The revolution is also known as the 
Technological Revolution and spanned the period from the 1850s to World War 
I and saw the age of steam power, electrification of factories, and new manufac­
turing “inventions.” The new manufacturing enabled assembly and led to mass 
production and, to some degree, the introduction of automation in the manufac­
turing industry.
•	 The third industrial revolution: This revolution is also known as the Digital 
Revolution and took place from the late 1950s to late 1970s and saw the age of 
computerization, a change from analog technology to digital technology. This

revolution has continuously pushed industrial development to a new level. It had 
to do with the rise of computers, computer networks (WAN, LAN, MAN), the 
rise of robotics in manufacturing, connectivity, and the birth of the Internet.
•	 The fourth industrial revolution: Finally, this revolution starting circa 2000–2016, 
or a few decades earlier, having been coined in Germany in 2011 at the Hannover 
Fair event as “Industrie 4.0” and having been referenced as the fourth industrial 
revolution (4IR) in 2016 by Klaus Schwab, is marked by full digitization and 
automation of manufacturing processes and is happening right now. It moves the 
pace of technological development from the Internet and the client-server model 
to ubiquitous technological fusion and mobility, the bridging of digital and phys­
ical environments, to the convergence of information technology (IT) and opera­
tional technology (OT) and emerging technologies such Internet of Things, big 
data, cloud computing, advanced robotics, etc.

5.3  Overview on Industry 4.0
The term “Industry 4.0” came from the German term “Industrie 4.0,” which was 
first used in 2011 in a project sponsored by the German government that was meant 
to promote the computerization of manufacturing [4]. To meet the challenges of 
traditional manufacturing, Germany introduced the concept of “Industry 4.0”; the 
5.3  Overview on Industry 4.0

70
Chinese government put forward the concept of “China Made 2025,” while the 
United States proposed the concept of “industrial Internet” [9]. Industry 4.0 has 
been predicted to be a game-changer, revolutionizing manufacturing practices.

•	 Intelligent Robots: Manufacturing paradigm is shifting rapidly from mass pro­
duction toward customized production using robots. Robots will interact with 
one another and work safely side by side with humans. Robots will be more

5  Industry 4.0

71
dominant in manufacturing and will dominate the production process. With the 
deployment of many intelligent industrial robots working as a team, it is feasible 
to have a larger range of manufacturing applications.
•	 Internet of Things: IoT refers to a network of physical devices that are digitally 
interconnected and facilitate communication and exchange of data through the 
Internet. It allows people and things to be connected anytime, anyplace, with 
anything and anyone. IoT enables a ubiquitous presence for a common purpose 
of various things or objects interacting and cooperating with each other, digi­
talizing all physical systems. Industry 4.0 means that more devices will be 
enriched with embedded computing. This will allow field devices to communi­
cate and interact both with one another. The Internet of Things is complemented 
by Internet of Services. The industrial IoT (or IIoT) is the implementation of IoT 
in the industrial sector. This is one of the important backbones of Industry 4.0.
•	 Cybersecurity: Devices are increasingly connected to the global network, the 
Internet. The possible damage of cyberattacks is substantial in terms of continu­
ity of business operations, theft of confidential information, and reputational 
harm. With the increased connectivity associated with Industry 4.0, there is need 
to protect critical industrial systems and manufacturing lines from cyber threats.
•	 Cloud Computing: Cloud computing is a means of pooling and sharing hardware 
and software resources on a massive scale. Users and businesses can access 
applications from anywhere in the world at any time. The main objective of 
cloud computing is to make a better use of distributed resources and solve large-­
scale computation problems. If used properly, cloud computing is a technology 
with great opportunity for businesses of all sizes. The adoption of cloud comput­
ing has several advantages related to cost reduction.
•	 Big Data: Data is becoming more and more accessible and ubiquitous in many 
industries, leading to the issue of big data. Big data usually comes from various 
sources such as sensors, devices, video/audio, networks, assorted generalized, 
and/or environmental databank systems and social media. In an Industry 4.0 sys­
tem or environment, the collection and comprehensive evaluation of data from 
many different sources will become as indispensable, and it is challenging. Big 
data is characterized in terms of ten (10) Vs: volume, variety, velocity, veracity, 
vision, volatility, verification, validation, variability, and value. Manufacturing 
competitiveness in the international market is enhanced by these characteristics.
•	 Additive Manufacturing (AM): This is the process of creating a 3D object based 
on the deposition of materials on a layer-by-layer or drop-by-drop basis. AM 
technologies are commonly referred to as rapid prototyping, layered manufactur­
ing, digital manufacturing, or 3D printing. With Industry 4.0, these additive-­
manufacturing methods will be widely used to produce small batches of 
customized products.
•	 Augmented Reality (AR): Increasing human performance is the main aim of 
AR. AR technology is applied in a wide range of sectors, including entertain­
ments, marketing, tourism, surgery, logistics, manufacturing, education, and 
maintenance. Companies will make much broader use of augmented reality to 
5.3  Overview on Industry 4.0

72
provide workers with real-time information to improve decision-making and 
work procedures.
•	 Automation: This involves using control systems to operate a process or system 
with minimal or no direct human intervention. Industry 4.0 can be defined as “a 
name for the current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing 
technologies.” Autonomous systems make decisions on their own. The automa­
tion increases efficiency and productivity. Industry 4.0 refers to the current trend 
of automation. This includes using machine-to-machine and Internet of Things 
(IoT) deployments to help manufacturers provide increased automation, 
improved communication, and monitoring leading to increased productivity, 
efficiency, waste reduction, and enhanced profits.
•	 Cyber-Physical System: CPS is the merger of “cyber” as in electrical and elec­
tronic systems with “physical” things. A CPS is a mechanism through which 
physical objects and software are closely intertwined. It consists of physical enti­
ties (such as machines, vehicles, work pieces, etc.), which are equipped with 
technologies such as RFIDs, sensors, microprocessors, telematics, or embedded 
systems. I4.0 can be assumed as a CPS production.
•	 Simulation: Computer simulation is an indispensable and powerful tool for suc­
cessful implementation of the digital manufacturing system. Simulation model­
ling involves using models of a system or a process to better understand or 
predict and improve the behavior or performance of the system or process. Like 
in experimentation, simulation modeling allows for the validation of products, 
processes, systems, and configurations in very short time orders such as millisec­
onds or microseconds. It helps with cost reduction, decreases development 
cycles, and increases product quality. It allows predictive analysts and simula­
tionists to gain insights into complex systems and tests before their real 
implementation.
Industry 4.0 may be regarded as the convergence and applications of the above 
simulation-based digital technologies. These are some of the important technolo­
gies transforming industrial production. These technologies will help Industry 4.0 
to realize smart industry and smart manufacturing goals.
5.4  Principles and Features

•	 Interconnection: The ability of machines, devices, and humans to connect and 
communicate with each other via the Internet of Things (IoT). This requires col­
laboration, security, and standards.
5  Industry 4.0

73
 
15
•	 Information Transparency: The ability of information systems to create a virtual 
copy of the physical world by enriching digital plant models with sensor data. 
This includes data analysis and provision of information.
•	 Technical Assistance: This refers to the ability of CPS to physically support 
humans by conducting a range of tasks that are unpleasant, too exhausting, or 
unsafe for their human coworkers. This requires visual and physical assistance.
•	 Decentralized Decisions: The ability of CPS to make decisions on their own and 
to perform their tasks as autonomously as possible. Their tasks are delegated to 
a higher level only when there is interference or conflicting goals.
•	 Interoperability: This is also known as collaboration. It is the ability to have 
many standards communicate with or talk to each other and exchange data. 
Interoperability means connected devices, connected communication technolo­
gies, connected people, and connected data that are collaborating to achieve the 
manufacturing goals and objectives of the enterprise. The maturity of cyber-­
physical systems allows humans and factories to connect and communicate with 
each other and derive insights in real time in support of increased efficiency and 
enhanced productivity and profits for the organization(s).
5.4  Principles and Features

74
•	 Modularity: This has to do with a shift from rigid systems, inflexible models, and 
planning to an environment where changing demands from customers, partners, 
and regulators market conditions are monitored, analyzed, and utilized causing 
the need for transformation and flexibility leading to increased efficiency, pro­
ductivity, and profits.
The main characteristic features of Industry 4.0 include the following [17]:
•	 Decentralization: Decentralization in Industry 4.0 organizations refers to a shift 
away from centralized control systems to decentralized control.
•	 Flexibility: This is a key attribute of Industry 4.0. It refers to the capability to 
position manufacturing to respond to changing demands. It is enabled by the 
application of cyber-physical production systems. Industry 4.0 allows a high 
flexibility in the operation of automated systems.
•	 Interconnectedness: This is a basic principle of Industry 4.0. It enables the com­
munication and information exchange between entities in the system. IoT enables 
interconnectedness.
•	 Customization: The mass customization of production, products, and services is 
regarded as a fundamental paradigm shift of Industry 4.0. This allows individual 
preferences to be included in the design in a cost-effective manner and is designed 
to increase users’ participation.
•	 Efficiency: This is an important consequence in the Industry 4.0 deployment or 
realization and is made possible by its enabling technologies. Industry 4.0 will 
ensure factories become smart and adaptable, leading to an improvement in their 
resource efficiency.
•	 Integration: This essentially refers to the enterprise-wide integration of enabling 
technologies and to a slightly lesser extent also to the value chain and the process 
level contributions to the manufacturing or production functions. In Industry 4.0 
context, there are three types of integration: horizontal integration, vertical inte­
gration, and end-to-end integration. The vertical integration is about the integra­
tion of IT systems at various hierarchical production and manufacturing levels. It 
will make the traditional automation pyramid view disappear. The horizontal 
integration is about the integration of OT systems and combines the operational 
technology (OT) to support the end-to-end value chain: from supplier and ulti­
mately the customer. Horizontal integration helps with horizontal coordination, 
collaboration, cost savings, value creation, and speed.
5.5  Applications
Industry 4.0 is still in the early stages of implementation. One of the original objec­
tives of Industry 4.0 was serving small and medium enterprises (SME) first. The 
major applications of Industry 4.0 are smart factory, smart/intelligent manufactur­
ing, smart product, and smart city [18].

•	 Intelligent Manufacturing: This is also known as smart manufacturing. It plays a 
crucial role in Industry 4.0. It is similar to cloud manufacturing and IoT-enabled 
manufacturing. It takes advantage of advanced information and manufacturing 
technologies to achieve flexible, smart, and reconfigurable manufacturing pro­
cesses in order to address the dynamics and fluctuations of the global market. It 
requires some underpinning technologies in order to enable devices to vary their 
behaviors in response to various situations. Intelligent manufacturing entails 
intelligent products, intelligent production, intelligent services, etc. It is not yet 
mature but is emerging.

•	 Mining Industry: Current challenges facing the mining industry include high 
global demand for raw materials, strict labor market, high standards of produc­
tion requirements, saving natural resources, international competition, and con­
tinued declining commodity prices and daily operational and industrial accident 
risks associated with mining operations and the attendant liability implications 
of those risks. To address these challenges, it is imperative to have a real-time 
flow of information between ERP. Industry 4.0 architecture and the allied tech­
nologies are applied to address the challenges that exist in the mining environ­
ment [21].
Industry 4.0 has also been applied in semiconductor industry, furniture industry, 
aluminum industry, food industry, automotive industry, process optimization, man­
ufacturing operations, and quality monitoring. Those who promote Industry 4.0 
claim that it will affect many areas such as services and business models, productiv­
ity, machine safety, product lifecycles, and industry value chains.
5.6  Benefits
Industry 4.0 ushers manufacturing and business actors, customers, the government, 
and society in general into the digitalization era, where everything is digital: busi­
ness models, environments, production systems, machines, operators, products, and 
services. The rise of Industry 4.0 makes it possible to gather and analyze data across 
machines, enabling faster, more flexible, and more efficient processes to produce

higher-quality goods at reduced costs. Industry 4.0 is revolutionizing manufactur­
ing, increasing flexibility, improving production processes, increasing productivity, 
affecting the whole product lifecycle, creating new business models, changing the 
work environment, and restructuring the labor market. It will also cause macroeco­
nomic shifts, foster industrial growth, increase production speeds, and boost 
employment. It benefits the factory, business, products, customers, and society in 
general [11]. It has potential to positively affect meeting individual customer 
requirements, production flexibility, data-driven decision-making, better customer 
proximity, efficiency, value creation opportunities through new services, and a com­
petitive economy. The capabilities of Industry 4.0 lead to the “smart anything” phe­
nomena which include smart grid, smart energy, smart cities, smart logistics, smart 
facilities, smart buildings, smart plants, smart manufacturing, smart factories, smart 
mining, smart oil and gas, smart healthcare, smart education, and smart “x” or 
“anything.”

5.8  Global Adoption of Industry 4.0
The techniques of Industry 4.0 have gone global. Industry 4.0, also known as the 
fourth industrial revolution, has caught the attention of organizations worldwide. It 
has become the future of global manufacturing. Nations around the world are 
actively upgrading their manufacturing industries and engaging in the adoption of 
Industry 4.0. Businesses everywhere can benefit from embracing Industry 4.0. This 
will create wealth and plenty of high technology job opportunities on the one hand 
as well as some displaced low-skill workers on the other hand, who may become 
unemployed and who may be untrainable, leading to the wider social divide, ineq­
uity, and societal tension, granted the disruptive nature of Industry 4.0. The global 
adoption of Industry 4.0 is not just a matter of government initiatives but also a 
result of an increasing focus and participation of industrial giants. We now consider 
the adoption of Industry 4.0 in different nations [24, 25].
•	 United States: The United States has the Smart Manufacturing Leadership 
Coalition (SMLC), a nonprofit organization consisting of manufacturers, gov­
ernment agencies, universities, and laboratories that have the common interest of 
advancing the way of thinking behind Industry 4.0. It is hoped that the coalition 
will enable manufacturers gain affordable access to technologies that can be 
adopted to meet their needs. The United States has also launched the Advanced 
Manufacturing Partnership.
•	 Germany: Germany introduced the phenomenon of Industry 4.0 in 2011 at the 
Hannover Fair event. It is a strategic initiative introduced by the German govern­
ment with the aim of transforming the manufacturing industry through digitali­
zation. German manufacturing strategy played a key role in maintaining and 
promoting its importance as a “forerunner” in Industry 4.0. Extensive efforts 
were made by the European manufacturing researchers and companies to 
embrace it. The German government along with its companies, universities, and 
research institutions are developing fully automated, Internet-based “smart” 
factories.
•	 China: In 2015, China’s government launched two actions simultaneously, i.e., 
the “Internet Plus” and “Made in China.” The development of Industry 4.0 in 
China will be directly related to the development of China’s industrial economy. 
The government announced elimination of rules that required car manufacturers 
such as General Motors to collaborate with a local company to open factories in 
China. The Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) in 
China led the creation of the “Made in China” initiative. This initiative aims 
include: increase innovative capability in national manufacturing, boost Chinese 
quality brand-building, promote environmentally friendly manufacturing, enable 
breakthroughs in key sectors, press further restructuring of the manufacturing 
industry, and increase international involvement in manufacturing.
•	 Japan: Japan has a Society 5.0 strategy. In 2015, Japan started its Industrial 
Value Chain Initiative (IVI), which corresponds to Germany’s Industry 4.0 initia­
tive. Thirty (30) Japanese companies, including Mitsubishi Electric, Fujitsu, 
5.8  Global Adoption of Industry 4.0

80
Nissan Motor, and Panasonic, are part of the initiative. The IVI is a forum 
designed to combine manufacturing and information technologies and create an 
environment where enterprises can collaborate. The forum is based on two prin­
ciples: connected manufacturing and the loosely defined standard.
5.9  Conclusion
Industry 4.0 is a broad domain that includes production processes, efficiency, data 
management, relationship with consumers, competitiveness, etc. The concept has 
attracted much attention all around the globe. However, Industry 4.0 is still in a 
conceptual state, with developed countries and Germany in particular leading 
the way.
Industry 4.0 may benefit emerging economies such as India. Today, the fourth 
industrial revolution is transforming economies, jobs, and society itself. Like any 
revolution, Industry 4.0 is disruptive and is rapidly changing the industrial land­
scape. It will have an important influence on the complete transformation and digi­
tization of the manufacturing industry. Industry 4.0 is the current gradual industrial 
transformation with automation, cloud computing, cyber-­physical systems, robots, 
and industrial IoT to realize smart industry and manufacturing. It is the new manu­
facturing objectives and, with the aim of achieving ideally, zero-­defects production 
in the manufacturing industry.
The world of manufacturing is changing rapidly. In order to survive and thrive, 
every manufacturer must be willing to invest in Industry 4.0. In other words, to stay 
Industry 4.0 competitive and remain relevant, manufacturers must commit to doing 
four things: identifying crucial business needs, investing in technology that will 
meet them, building organizational capabilities, and actively adapting effective and 
efficient processes and synergistic cultures [26].
The Industry 4.0 era requires engineering roles with different knowledge and 
skills that combine IT and production knowledge. Academic institutions along with 
their engineering colleges can play a vital role in meeting this need. Some universi­
ties are already making a concerted effort to train the next generation of engineers 
that are ready to work in an Industry 4.0 environment. More information about 
Industry 4.0 can be found in [5, 27–32] and the following related journal:

Industrial IOT in Manufacturing
6.1  Introduction
Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of connected devices like intelligent comput­
ers, devices, and objects. It may also be regarded as a worldwide network that con­
nects devices to the Internet and to each other using wired or wireless technology. 
IoT is expanding rapidly, and it has been estimated that 50 billion devices will be 
connected to the Internet by 2020. These include smartphones, tablets, desktop 
computers, autonomous vehicles, refrigerators, toasters, thermostats, cameras, pet 
monitors, alarm systems, home appliances, insulin pumps, industrial machines, 
intelligent wheelchairs, wireless sensors, mobile robots, etc. [1]. The growth of 
Internet of Things (IoT) is drastically making impact on home and industry. The IoT 
has amalgamated hardware and software to the Internet, thereby creating a smarter 
world. The application of IoT to the manufacturing industry is known as industrial 
Internet of Things (IIoT).
While the IoT affects transportation, manufacturing healthcare, or smart homes, 
the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) refers to particular applications of IoT to 
industrial environments. IIoT is a new industrial ecosystem that combines intelli­
gent and autonomous machines, advanced predictive analytics, and machine-human 
collaboration to improve productivity, efficiency, and reliability. It is bringing about 
a world where smart, connected embedded systems and products operate as part of 
larger systems. Like IoT, the Industrial IoT covers many industries and applications. 
It opens plenty of opportunities in automation, optimization, manufacturing, agri­
culture, mining, transportation and intelligent vehicle highway systems (IVHS), 
artificial intelligent (AI) industry, chemical industry, nuclear industry, agricultural 
industry, mining industry, logistics, oil and gas, transportation, energy/utilities, 
chemical, aviation, aerospace, and other industrial sectors.
The real danger is not that computers will begin to think like 
men, but that men will begin to think like computers.

Manufacturing is the largest IIoT market. It is also the largest industry from an 
IoT spending (software, hardware, connectivity, and services) perspective. 
Manufacturing is among the industrial sectors that will be directly impacted by the 
disruption springing from IIoT. A smart production unit may consist of a large con­
nected industrial system of materials, parts, machines, tools, inventory, and logistics 
that can relay data and communicate with each other [2].
This chapter provides application of IIoT in manufacturing. It begins by provid­
ing an overview on IoT and IIoT. It presents some applications of IIOT in manufac­
turing. It highlights the benefits and challenges of applying IIoT in manufacturing. 
It covers global adoption of IIoT in manufacturing. The last section concludes with 
comments.
6.2  Overview of Internet of Things
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new paradigm that promises to allow a variety of 
things (such as cars, refrigerators, microwaves, thermostats, mobile devices, 
machines, animals, people, etc.) to be augmented with networking and sensing 
capabilities, enabling them to work together. It is a global connected network that 
allows people and devices to interact. The term, Internet of Things, was first coined 
by Kevin Ashton, a British entrepreneur in 1999. He meant to represent the concept 
of computers and machines with sensors, which are connected to the Internet to 
report status and accept control commands [3].
IoT (also known as sensor network or industrial Internet) is a global network of 
interconnected devices (such as sensors, actuators, personal electronic devices, lap­
tops, tablets, digital cameras, smart phones, alarm systems, home appliances, or 
industrial machines, and other smart devices) that are enabled with technology of 
interacting and communicating with each other. It mainly enables the interconnec­
tion of Thing to Thing (T2T), Human to Thing (H2T), and Human to Human (H2H). 
By collecting and combining data from various IoT devices and using big data ana­
lytics, decision-makers can take appropriate actions with important economic, 
social, and environmental implications.
The IoT can be divided into three layers [4]: perception (or sensing) layer, net­
work layer, and application layer.
	1.	 The perception layer collects pertinent and sensorizable information from 
devices, RFID tags and readers, camera, GPS, and sensors. In this layer, the 
wireless smart systems with sensors can automatically sense and exchange 
information among different devices and remotely control them. Any contriv­
ance can have sensors attached to them: people, machines, vehicles, robots, pro­
duction line, etc.
	2.	 The network layer is mainly messaging and processing information. The role of 
this layer is to connect all Internet of Things (IoT) compatible devices together 
and allow them to share the information with each other.

IoT is being implemented in healthcare, wearables, smart cities, smart home, 
agriculture, automotive, aviation, aerospace, textile, transportation, and manufac­
turing industries. It has become a powerful force for manufacturing companies. 
Harnessing the IoT in the world of manufacturing leads to limitless possibilities. 
Many manufacturers use IoT in conjunction with sensors and employ IoT devices to 
improve efficiencies and safety. IoT technologies are designed to facilitate and opti­
mize manufacturing processes. They are expanding from household and business 
use cases to industrial applications. The issue of growing competition and inexpen­
sive connectivity has made IoT crucial and relevant in manufacturing.
6.3  Industrial Internet of Things
The industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is basically an application of IoT across 
several industries, such as manufacturing (Industry 4.0), logistics, oil and gas, trans­
portation, energy, mining, aerospace, aviation, automotive, textile, and other indus­
trial sectors. It can be regarded as machines, computers, and people enabling 
intelligent industrial operations using advanced data analytics. It is a network of 
systems, objects, platforms, and applications that can communicate and share intel­
ligence. It may also be regarded as a network of intelligent devices connected to 
form systems that monitor, collect, exchange, and analyze data. It is the biggest and 
most important part of the overall Internet of Things picture.

The term “industrial Internet” was coined by Industrial giant GE to describe 
industrial transformation in the connected context of machines, cyber-physical sys­
tems, advanced analytics, AI, people, cloud, and so on. GE and the Industrial 
Internet Consortium (IIC) decided that IIoT was a synonym for the industrial 
Internet. IIoT is poised to bring unprecedented opportunities to business and soci­
ety. Organizations like IIC and IEEE are working concertedly and synergistically to 
define and develop the IIoT.
6  Industrial IOT in Manufacturing

87
IIoT can be implemented on industrial equipment, personnel, and processes, 
which are all interconnected. IIoT connectivity drives the convergence of opera­
tional technology (robots, conveyor belt, smart meters, generator, etc.) and informa­
tion technology. Within manufacturing, intelligent sensors, distributed control, and 
secure software are the glue. Forward-thinking manufacturers connect their prod­
ucts to IIoT. They will position themselves as future leaders, while those that fail to 
act now risk being left behind [11]. Some innovation is necessary to improve the 
quality and make industrial IoT applications cost-effective.

6.4  Applications

88
•	 Automation: The IIoT is an enabler of industrial automation. Traditionally, plant 
networks are isolated from each other and from business networks. Now, we can 
use IoT to connect everything (people, devices, equipment, etc.) within the fac­
tory and provide connectivity, communication, and information sharing. This 
will help manufacturers to automate the production process, thereby eliminating 
human intervention.
•	 Supply Chain Management: IoT devices can track and trace the inventory system 
on a global scale in real-time. The IIoT-enabled systems can be configured for 
location tracking and remote monitoring of inventory. Manufacturers can access 
real-time supply chain information by using IIoT to track materials and products 
as they move through the supply chain. IIoT will reduce the expenditure due to 
mismanagement in the organization. Smart supply chain management solutions 
using IIoT can enable manufacturers to have real-time insights into the location, 
status, and condition of every object and process.
•	 Smart Automotive Manufacturing: The smart manufacturing enterprise consists 
of smart machines, plants, and operations all with intelligence. As the global 
market compels manufacturers to reconsider operations, smart manufacturing 
powered by IIoT-driven data analytics becomes important. The automotive 
industry uses IIoT devices along with industrial robots in the manufacturing pro­
cess. Robots are effectively and commendably reducing downtime in automotive 
manufacturing. IIoT can automate many of complex process involved in manu­
facturing. Mobile sensors, cloud computing, and new applications are helping 
industrial IoT to become essential and indispensable to automotive 
manufacturing.
•	 Manufacturing Plants: IIoT has many applications in manufacturing plants. It 
can facilitate the production flow in a manufacturing plant, as IoT devices auto­
matically monitor development cycles and manage warehouses as well as inven­
tories. The IIoT deployment is a primary reason why investment in IoT devices 
has skyrocketed over the past few decades.
•	 Mining: Today, the mining industry depends heavily on commercial systems and 
applications which are not interoperable. This is due to the fact that the commer­
cial systems have their individual non-IIoT compliant technology stack and data 
formats. This constitutes a major challenge for applying IIoT in the mining 
industry and slows production. Thus, the mining industry has unique challenges 
in comparison to other industries due to the infrastructural limitations at the mine 
sites, which may be underground or surface. In modern mining, there must be a 
real-time flow of information between enterprise level and shop floor systems. 
The adoption of IIoT standards practices in the mining industry is an uphill task 
due to the complex nature of the mining operations. The adoption of IIoT tech­
nology in the mining industry offers safer mine site for workers, makes mining 
operations predictable, boosts productivity, provides interoperable environment 
for both traditional and modern systems/devices, and reduces human error and 
intervention by automating. IIoT deployment in the mining industry improves 
efficiency, decreases operational costs, and reduces energy usage.
6  Industrial IOT in Manufacturing

89
Other applications of IIoT in manufacturing include digital supply chain, retail, 
automotive, unmanned aerial vehicles or drones, aerospace, aviation, agriculture, 
predictive maintenance, data-enabled services, connected logistics, smart homes, 
smart grid, smart city, smart farming, energy consumption optimization, safety, and 
health monitoring of workers.
6.5  Benefits
Industrial IoT will have huge and beneficial impacts in manufacturing. It can 
enhance productivity, boost operational performance, increase efficiency, increase 
throughput, assist asset monitoring, minimize financial risk, reduce production 
downtime or boost the production speed, improve product quality, reduce overhead, 
conserve resources, increase profits, eliminate waste, support better customer expe­
rience, and improve employee health and safety. Other benefits include [15]:
•	 Enhancing Productivity: All the investment on building connectivity may seem 
futile if one cannot make sense of the data collected, therefore emphasizing the 
great importance of IIoT deployment for productivity improvement. Monitoring 
the whole manufacturing process digitally and economically helps in boosting 
the productivity of the manufacturing industry.
•	 Workplace Safety: This is a top concern in the manufacturing industry. An advan­
tage of IIoT is its ability to increase safety in manufacturing. A workers’ safety 
in the manufacturing environment can improve by deployment of IoT combined 
with big data analytics. IIoT system can help assure employees’ safety and 
equipment uptimes and equipment utilization by monitoring equipment for 
potentially dangerous failures.
•	 Well-Being of Workers: Proactive manufacturers see the pandemic-related invest­
ments as a great platform to offer safety of coworkers by tracking their location. 
Wearable ear devices that can allow workers to set their own soundtrack can 
boost employee safety and worker on-the-job satisfaction ratings.
•

•	 Customer Satisfaction: The issue of the customer value always comes before 
selecting technical solutions. IIoT technology is having a great impact on cus­
tomer experience by enhancing customer satisfaction. It is ushering in a new age 
of opportunity, enabling businesses to drive customer relationships that are closer 
and more profitable than ever before.
6.5  Benefits

90
 
16
•	 Asset Management: IIoT solves some of the challenges facing asset-intensive 
companies. An automotive manufacturer can take advantage of IIoT to track its 
assets, including automotive fleet, tools, and vehicle parts. IIoT can also track 
asset locations with smart sensors, monitor demand-supply requirements, and 
manage the production accordingly. IIoT is applied in manufacturing to ensure 
proper asset usage and provide the best return on assets.
•	 Quality Control and Long Run Organizational Sustainability: IoT sensors col­
lect data from various stages of a product life cycle. The IoT device can provide 
data about the customer satisfaction levels, sentiments, customer experiences, 
and suggestions after using the product. These inputs can be analyzed to identify 
and correct quality, reliability, and safety issues, which can lead to significant 
improvement, long-term customer satisfaction, and loyalty resulting in the long 
run organizational sustainability

6.6  Challenges
The industrial Internet of Things is still in its early age. Although it offers several 
benefits for manufacturing and is poised to grow significantly, there are challenges 
which can hinder future growth. Some of the challenges facing the adoption of IIoT 
in manufacturing include [18]:
6  Industrial IOT in Manufacturing

91
 
19
•	 Security: A major challenge for executives is cybersecurity and data security, 
which is rising in importance due to increased vulnerability to attacks and data 
breaches. Connecting industrial machines to an interconnected system is risky. A 
secure environment is necessary to protect machines and employees from cyber 
threats. In the IIoT context, data is considered sensitive because data will encap­
sulate various aspects of industrial operation, including highly sensitive informa­
tion about products, business strategies, and companies. The transition to more 
open network architectures and data sharing of IoT poses challenges in industrial 
markets. The loss of sensitive information can lead to significant business loss 
and cause reputational damage [19].
•	 Interoperability: The manufacturing processes deployed in different industries 
vary based on such factors as industry positioning and prevailing industrial stan­
dards, customers served and customer requirements, etc. Interoperability between 
sensors, edge devices, and the cloud has always been an important challenge. 
Standards are not in place to ensure the transferring of data between machines 
from different vendors.
•	 Lack of Standards: Standards are needed to enable smart, connected machines, 
products, and assets to interact in a transparent, effective, and synergistic man­
ner. They are vital to ensure that any new device added to the infrastructure can 
interact seamlessly with existing equipment. The question of standardization is 
currently being addressed by the Industry 4.0 and the Industrial Internet 
Consortium [20].
•	 Lack of Skills: A major challenge making companies not to be ready for the 
industrial Internet of Things is a lack of skilled workers in the IIoT high technol­
ogy arena. As IIoT is a new area, new industry skills are required and plans need 
to be implemented to grow the talent corp needed to sustain this new and emerg­
ing high technological industrial communications giant.
•	 Integration: Data integration is a major challenge because it is not easy to move 
from data to business value. The integration of IIoT solutions into existing busi­
6.6  Challenges

ness processes and industrial environment brings new challenges. It is only when 
the data from IoT solutions is fully integrated with data from enterprise systems 
that the most benefits can be achieved. Integrating information technology (IT) 
and operational technology (OT) is another critical challenge faced by the com­
panies during industrial IoT implementation.

Industrial IoT can radically transform manufacturing. Manufacturing is poised to 
keep the first position across the globe when it comes to using IoT. IoT deployments 
offer rapid return and enable manufacturers to realize digital transformations from 
several perspectives: efficiency, automation, customer-centricity, productivity, and 
competitive advantage with long-run implications for organizational profitability, 
growth, and sustainability. We will consider how some nations have implemented 
IIoT in their manufacturing sector.
•	 United States: Industrial giant GE coined the term industrial Internet which 
really describes industrial transformation. In that regard, a linguistic parallel can 
be made with the word coinage, “Internet of Everything,” a term Cisco coined 
and used up until 2016. In many regards, the Internet of Everything, in an indus­
trial context, is closer to industrial IoT. Companies such as GE, IBM, and Cisco 
operate across the globe and are often members of several industry bodies at the 
same time.
•	 United Kingdom: The United Kingdom is going through a productivity crisis. 
For manufacturing companies across the United Kingdom, the benefits of 
increased operational performance and improved reliability realized through 
IIoT solutions are compelling. While the United Kingdom’s problem with pro­
ductivity is complex, innovation in technology undeniably has an important role 
to play in addressing the challenge. IIoT technology provides, which recipro­
cally holds the potential to have a transformative effect for the manufacturing 
sector. Through greater efficiency, improved business insights, and better-­
informed decisions, IIoT technology can help the United Kingdom boost its pro­
ductivity significantly [21].
•	 India: This is a nation that lacks in adapting to newer technologies. Traditional 
businesses in India are being disrupted with the advent of newly emerging tech­
nologies. In 2020, India contributed just $10 billion out the global IoT market of 
$373 billion. India is regarded as a hub for human resource. This should propel 
India to new heights in the field of IIoT [22].
•	 China: Chinese tech giants such as Tencent, Alibaba, JD, and Baidu have all put 
in place aggressive plans to adopt IIoT. That is merely a tip of the iceberg of 
China’s aggressive IIoT development plan. It is expected that investment drives 
to reduce China’s dependence on foreign technology would continue to be an 
important trend to watch [23].

6.8  Conclusion
The Internet of Things (IoT) and its subset, the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), 
are transforming modern manufacturing. The industrial Internet of Things refers to 
a vast number of interconnected industrial systems that are communicating, sharing 
data, and improving industrial performance to benefit the society. Recently, IIoT has 
emerged as a subparadigm which focuses more on safety-critical applications in 
industries like aerospace, aviation, automotive, agriculture, food processing, energy, 
and healthcare. It may be regarded as an important element of the fourth industrial 
revolution that is changing the face of industry in a profound manner. In manufac­
turing, IIOT improves productivity, enhances efficiency, and drives competitive 
advantage.
Companies that want to stay competitive should embrace the IIoT as soon as 
possible. In virtually every industry, areas can be identified to get started, where 
implementation costs are low and payoffs are high. More information about IIoT 
can be found in the books in [22–27] and in the following related journals: IoT and

Big Data in Manufacturing
7.1  Introduction
The manufacturing industry adds a lot of value to any nation’s economy. 
Manufacturing is critical to national economies by providing jobs and improving 
the quality of life through innovation. It is well-known that manufacturing repre­
sents the most challenging and complex industry as far as the variety of its products 
is concerned. Most industrial manufacturing companies have complex manufactur­
ing processes often with equally complex supply chain and suppliers. There are 
different types of manufacturing including biopharmaceutical manufacturing, 
chemical manufacturing, discrete manufacturing, aerospace manufacturing, 
advanced manufacturing, smart manufacturing, cloud manufacturing, offshore 
manufacturing, lean manufacturing, green manufacturing, sustainable manufactur­
ing, distributed manufacturing, predictive manufacturing, computer-integrated 
manufacturing, and computer-aided manufacturing.
Manufacturers of all types of products are finding significant value in big data. In 
the data-driven economy, turning data into actionable analytics is the best way to 
boost efficiency, safety, quality, and productivity. Modern manufacturing facilities 
are data-rich environments that exploit and thrive on manufacturing intelligence. 
The potential benefits of manufacturing intelligence include improvements in oper­
ational efficiency, process innovation, and environmental impact [1].

This chapter provides an introduction to the use of big data in manufacturing. It 
begins by giving an overview on the characteristics of big data. It covers big data 
analytics. It describes the role of big data in manufacturing. It presents some appli­
cations of big data in manufacturing. It highlights the benefits and challenges of big 
data in manufacturing.
It presents global adoption of big data in manufacturing. The last section con­
cludes with comments.
7.2  Big Data Characteristics
Big data (BD) is the umbrella term used to define large chunks of data found in 
industrial machines, government filings, medical records, and other sources. It 
includes complex and diverse streams of data obtained from various sources and 
requires advanced processing techniques. It is a relatively newer technology that 
can help the manufacturing industry. The three main sources of big data are 
machines, people, and companies. Big data can be described with 42 Vs [4]. The 
first five Vs are volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value [5].
7  Big Data in Manufacturing

97
•	 Volume: This refers to the size of the data being generated both inside and outside 
organizations and is increasing annually. Some regard big data asdata over one 
petabyte in volume.
•	 Velocity: This depicts the unprecedented speed at which data are generated by 
Internet users, mobile users, social media, etc. Data are generated and processed 
in a fast way to extract useful, relevant information. Big data could be analyzed 
in real time, and it has movement and velocity.
•	 Variety: This refers to the data types, since big data may originate from heteroge­
neous sources and is in different formats (e.g., videos, images, audio, text, logs). 
BD comprises of structured, semi-structured, or unstructured data.
•	 Veracity: By this, we mean the truthfulness of data, i.e., whether the data comes 
from a reputable, trustworthy, authentic, and accountable source. It suggests the 
inconsistency in the quality of different sources of big data. The data may not be 
100% correct.
•	 Value: This is the most important aspect of the big data. It is the desired outcome 
of big data processing. It refers to the process of discovering hidden values from 
large datasets. It denotes the value derived from the analysis of the existing data. 
If one cannot extract some business value from the data, there is no use managing 
and storing it.
On this basis, small data can be regarded as having low volume, low velocity, low 
variety, low veracity, and low value. Additional five Vs have been added [6]:
•	 Validity: This refers to the accuracy and correctness of data. It also indicates how 
up-to-date it is.
•	 Viability: This identifies the relevancy of data for each use case. Relevancy of 
data is required to maintain the desired and accurate outcome through analytical 
and predictive measures.
•	 Volatility: Since data are generated and change at a rapid rate, volatility deter­
mines how quickly data change.
•	 Vulnerability: The vulnerability of data is essential because privacy and security 
are of utmost importance for personal data.
•	 Visualization: Data needs to be presented unambiguously and attractively to the 
user. Proper visualization of large and complex clinical reports helps in finding 
valuable insights.

To thrive in today’s complex business environment, businesses must adopt a 
data-driven culture and leverage analytics platforms to make key decisions that 
improve productivity. Industries that benefit from big data include the healthcare, 
financial, airline, travel, restaurants, automobile, sports, agriculture, manufacturing, 
and hospitality industries. Big data technologies are playing an essential role in 
farming: machines are equipped with sensors that measure data in their environment.
7.2  Big Data Characteristics

98
 
7.3  Big Data Analytics
Every day, data is growing bigger and bigger, and big data analysis (BDA) has 
become a requirement for gaining invaluable insights into data such that companies 
could gain significant profits in the global market. Once the big data is ready for 
analysis, we use advanced software programs such as Hadoop, MapReduce, 
MongoDB, and NoSQL databases [8]. Big data analytics refers to how we can 
extract, validate, translate, and utilize big data as a new currency of information 
transactions. It is an emerging field that is aimed at creating empirical predictions. 
Data-driven organizations use analytics to guide decisions at all levels [9].
Data scientists know how to use tools that identify patterns and relationships that 
may otherwise remain hidden. They are part of virtually every major industry, and 
manufacturing is no exception. Manufacturing big data analytics is expected to 
ensure better farming practices and decision-making and a sustainable future for 
humankind. This will involve artificial intelligence and machine-learning technolo­
gies to determine better manufacturing practices and decision-making [10].
Implementing a big data analytics solution can help almost every part of a manu­
facturing enterprise. The manufacturer industry is beginning to deploy big data ana­
lytics for two essential tasks: gain control of the vast amounts of data generated and 
use the right information to drive productivity and enhance decision-making [11]. 
One way manufacturers can take more control of their quality parameters is through 
data analytics. To stay competitive and keep pace with consumers’ fickle buying 
habits, the manufacturing industry must consider implementing data analytics tools. 
7  Big Data in Manufacturing

99
A very important attribute of data analytics is that it can be implemented anywhere 
in the world.
7.4  Big Data in Manufacturing
Manufacturing can be described as a 5 M system which consists of [12]:
•	 Materials (properties and functions)
•	 Machines (precision and capabilities)
•	 Methods (efficiency and productivity)
•	 Measurements (sensing and improvement)
•	 Modeling (prediction, optimization, and prevention)

18
•	 Preventive Maintenance: Operational efficiency relies on the availability of the 
machinery in the production process. Manufacturers can use the best big data 
analytics software to determine the status of the machine. This approach is often 
called preventive maintenance. Most manufacturers often follow some schedule 
of preventative maintenance. Being able to predict equipment failure can save 
manufacturers significant maintenance time and boost production rates.
•	 Product Design: Developing new products can be expensive. Big data analytics 
software can analyze data and help identify trends and market changes that can 
be fed into the design of new products.
7  Big Data in Manufacturing

101
 
17
•	 Production Management Automation: Automation of the production management 
is probably the hardest way of using big data in manufacturing processes. A good 
example of production management automation is the case with GE’s wind tur­
bines. Sensors provide data on energy generation and wind direction, according to 
which the blade pitch is changed to optimize the wind turbine’s efficiency.
•	 Customer Experience: Excellent customer experience has become an essential 
part of every business. The big data analytics solutions draw customer data from 
a wide variety of sources and use the data for in-depth data analysis. Manufacturers 
now use big data analytics solutions to examine social media, customer service, 
and marketing data.
•	 Supply Chain Improvement: Timing is everything. Big data enables manufactur­
ers to track the exact location of their products. Modern supply chains are becom­
ing increasingly complex. Big data analytics solutions deliver supply chain 
visibility to instantly know key supply chain information. Big data can provide 
information about the supply chain and makes it possible to predict with greater 
certainty whether or not a supplier will deliver as agreed. It also increases trans­
parency into the entire supply chain.
•	 Quality Assessment: Quality is a priority to manufacturers. Maintenance of prod­
uct quality is essential to manufacturers. Quality control is an area that has 
­traditionally remained in the realm of human operations. With customers 
demanding more customization, quality control assessment has become impor­
tant for manufacturing. With the advent of big data analytics, automatic quality 
testing is helping to drive production efficiencies, improve production quality, 
save time, and help avoid human errors. Many manufacturers have turned to big 
data to help them improve their quality assurance. By using big data and advanced 
7.5  Applications

102
analytics, manufacturing companies can view product quality and delivery accu­
racy in real-time. Big data analytics can help manufacturers keep up with quality 
metrics and standards. Big data can also be used to reduce wastage. Using big 
data analytics can help managers identify whether some products are good or 
not. Using big data and advanced analytics, manufacturers are able to view prod­
uct quality and delivery accuracy in real-time.
The range of applications of big data in the manufacturing industry is limited 
only by the creativity and imagination of the big data analyst, technology leaders, 
and business executives.
7.6  Benefits
With big data analytics, a company can improve manufacturing, customize product 
design, ensure better quality assurance, manage the supply chain, and evaluate for any 
potential risk [19]. With many manufacturers setting the goal of getting the right quan­
tity of products to the right market at the right time and at the right price, they need to 
consider harnessing big data to gain actionable insights, make better decisions, and 
boost the bottom line. Big data analytics can help businesses to make informed and 
timely decisions, which are crucial for business improvement and growth. In a very 
competitive environment, manufacturers can turn to big data to improve their business 
operations. Big data can take a manufacturer from predictive decision-making to pre­
scriptive decision-making, thereby leveraging significant competitive advantages with 
implications for increased revenues, profitability, and business growth.
Other benefits include [15, 18, 20, 21]:
•	 Lifeblood of Manufacturing: Big data can help gain insights into your manufac­
turing operations and reveal the glitches in the business operations. Its analysis 
opens a window of opportunity for manufacturers to identify and fix problems.
•	 Reduced Process Flaws: Data analytics can greatly improve assembly-line effi­
ciency, stream process flows, and support corrective and preventive maintenance 
operations thereby further reducing process flaws.
•	 Speeding Up Assembly: Big data helps manufacturing companies to know where 
they are most efficient, with the added possibility of producing more products in 
that area.
•	 Improved Workforce Efficiency: Big data in manufacturing can improve produc­
tivity, growth, and workforce efficiency.
•	 Competitive Advantage: It is becoming a crucial way for companies to outper­
form their peers by leveraging data-driven strategies.
•	 Increased Efficiency: Manufacturing big data can greatly improve production 
line speed and quality, which helps a manufacturing company control costs, 
increase productivity, and boost margins.
•	 Improved Customer Service: Big data analytics solutions can help manufacturers 
better gauge customer sentiment and respond to customers in real time.
7  Big Data in Manufacturing

103
 
•	 Regulatory Compliance: Data analytics can be effectively used to ensure regula­
tory compliance.
•	 Improvements in Yield: Big data analytics can be a critical tool for realizing 
improvements in yield, particularly in a manufacturing environment with pro­
cess complexity, process variability, and capacity restraints. Big data can improve 
product accuracy during the production process.
•	 System Integration: Using big data technologies for system integration is a cru­
cial enabler of smart manufacturing. This allows for integrating and cooperating 
manufacturing systems to timely adapt dynamic demands from production and 
supply chain.
•	 Accurate Prediction: This enables manufacturing to change from the reactionary 
to the preventive mode of operations. Due to the increasing use of big data ana­
lytic in manufacturing, it is feasible to predict the behaviors of individual or 
linked manufacturing systems accurately. Predictive modeling helps in better 
forecasting of a host of business aspects.
7.6
7.7  Challenges
As far as big data is concerned, the manufacturing industry has its share of chal­
lenges to contend with. Similar to big data, manufacturing organizations face the 
same challenges associated with 5 Vs of big data (volume, velocity, variety, verac­
ity, and value). The challenges include the following [20, 22, 23]:
•	 Complexity: Due to the complex nature of manufacturing, adoption of latest 
technologies is always difficult.
7.7  Challenges

104
•	 Environmental Issues: As suits the occasion, the incident, or where warranted, 
some drastic measures may need to be implemented to reduce the adverse effects 
of manufacturing on the environment.
•	 Regulation Requirements: The manufacturing industry inadvertently exposes 
itself to safety risks (to humans) arising out of industrial accidents, and mitigat­
ing this is an imperative for safeguarding the value of human life and property as 
well as the avoidance or reduction of litigation.
•	 Product Development and Innovation: Manufacturers must constantly innovate 
and creatively advance news ways of thinking and solving of manufacturing 
problems in order to stay relevant and compete.
•	 Preventive Maintenance: Minimum disruption to business operations is one of 
the main challenging tasks for manufacturers.
•	 Faster Time-to-Market: Manufacturers have a very short time span within which 
to launch their products, else they risk losing out to competitors.
•	 Market Volatility: Market volatility constrains enhanced product performance, 
thus impeding business growth, sustainability, and profitability.
•	 Big or Huge Data and Manual Analysis: Manual analysis of big or huge data is 
undesirable as it is inherently time-consuming, labor intensive, error-prone, and 
risk laden (human errors).
•	 Judicious Use: Big data often leads managers to rely too much on the data and 
abdicate the very important role of sound and insightful decision-making. They 
need to be judicious in their use of data especially around privacy and sensitivity 
concerns.
•	 Cybersecurity: With the increasing adoption of emerging technologies in the 
manufacturing industry, the security concerns are becoming significant. 
Manufacturing is one of the most targeted industries by cyberattackers owing to 
the presence of vital data, making manufacturers subjected to cybersecurity inci­
dents. Perhaps the smartest way that organizations can address the huge demand 
for cybersecurity skills is to invest in cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is an essential 
and advanced technology needed to protect data assets in manufacturing. Areas 
that are vulnerable in both the physical and cyberspace of the manufacturing 
systems must be identified and protected.
•	 Standardization: Standardization of big data platform improves the feasibility of 
enterprise-ready solutions in manufacturing. Cybersecurity will continuously 
challenge manufacturing because security standards are still not available in 
some systems.
•	 Ethical Issues: There are four major ethical challenges in manufacturing: (1) 
privacy, sharing of personal information without permission; (2) security, 
­protection of data from outside threats; (3) ownership, the rightful ownership of 
the data used for analytics; (4) evidence-based decision-making, the use of data 
to make decisions about a population based solely on quantitative information.

7.8  Global Adoption of Big Data in Manufacturing
The manufacturing sector has been the backbone of many developed and develop­
ing markets. Using big data analytics in manufacturing, companies can tackle global 
development challenges, such as strategically transferring production to other coun­
tries or opening new factories in new and potentially very profitable locations. In 
developed economies, manufacturers can use big data to reduce costs and deliver 
greater creativity and innovation in products and services. Industry classification 
benchmark organizations such as the North American Industry Classification 
System (NAICS) and International Standard of Industrial Classification (ISIC) have 
categorized the manufacturing industry into two major segments based on the pro­
duction processes they follow—discrete manufacturing and process manufacturing. 
We now consider how some nations adopt big data in their manufacturing sector.
•	 United States: Manufacturing sector adds great value to the US economy. The 
United States is among the lead innovators and users of big data analytics in the 
manufacturing industry and is expected to hold a significant share over the fore­
cast period. According to the MAPI (Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity 
and Innovation), the manufacturing sector is forecast to increase faster than the 
general economy. For example, American multinational Intel corporation has 
been harnessing big data in support of its processor manufacturing operations for 
some time. It is using big data to develop chips faster, identify manufacturing 
glitches, and advance warnings about security threats. Its factory equipment gen­
erated data into their big data solution. The analytics solution uses this data for 
artificial intelligence (AI)-driven pattern recognition, fault detection, and visual­
ization. Their predictive maintenance reduces reaction time from 4 hours to 30 
seconds and cuts costs. Intel predicted saving $100 million in 2017 [15, 24].
•	 United Kingdom: The UK defense minister recently confirmed that sponsored 
cyberattacks on the United Kingdom’s infrastructure could cause economic 
chaos. The United Kingdom used to lead the world in cybersecurity expertise. 
Today, government representatives are searching for expertise and skills across 
the globe. Home-grown talent is not being developed enough. Organizations in 
the United Kingdom now realize the need to invest heavily in security [25].
•	 Germany: Manufacturing is regarded as an important factor for the European 
economy and also for societal development and growth. Industry 4.0 is a German 
government initiative that promotes automation of the manufacturing industry 
with the goal of developing smart factories. Big data is already being used for 
optimizing production schedules based on supplier, customer, machine availabil­
ity, and cost constraints.
7.8  Global Adoption of Big Data in Manufacturing

106
7.9  Conclusion
The big data era has emerged. Data has long been the lifeblood of manufacturing. In 
order to become more competitive and improve their efficiency and productivity, 
manufacturers must embrace big data and big data analytics. Use of data analytics 
to make decisions about business strategy and operations is becoming common­
place. Today, leveraging big data has become a business imperative since it is 
enabling solutions to long-standing business challenges for manufacturing compa­
nies worldwide. The leading manufacturers are poised to use big data technologies 
to capitalize on this and many other sources and expand their customer base across 
foreign countries. For those manufacturing businesses that are still wondering what 
big data can do for them, the sooner they get to using big data analytics, the sooner 
they will be able to apply the latest innovations in data science in support of their 
manufacturing operations. Once they do so, the sky’s the limit. More information on 
big data in manufacturing can be found in the books in [26, 27] and related journals: 
Journal of Big Data and Manufacturing Letters.

Additive Manufacturing
8.1  Introduction
Manufacturing is essentially about converting raw material into products and 
services.
Today, we are witnessing a manufacturing trend toward miniaturization. As a 
result, there is an ever-increasing demand for miniaturized components. Additive 
manufacturing (AM) has emerged as a prototyping method. It is a new technology 
to automatically produce three-dimensional (3D) objects by printing successive lay­
ering of material. It goes by other names such as free form fabrication, rapid proto­
typing (RP), 3D printing, or direct digital manufacturing. It describes the 
technologies for building 3D objects by adding layer upon layer of material, and the 
material could be plastic, metal, concrete, or human tissue. AM is often regarded as 
an Industry 4.0 technology [1].

This chapter provides a brief introduction to additive manufacturing for readers 
with both a technical and business mindset. It begins by describing what additive 
manufacturing is all about. It describes seven additive manufacturing processes. It 
presents some application of additive manufacturing. It highlights the benefits and 
challenges of AM. It covers the global adoption of AM. The last section concludes 
with comments.
Additive manufacturing could reduce energy use by 50 percent 
and reduce materials costs by up to 90 percent compared to 
traditional manufacturing.

8.2  What Is Additive Manufacturing?
Additive manufacturing (AM) technology first emerged in the 1980s. The rise of 
AM can be attributed to a technology called stereolithography that was developed 
in the 1980s. Additive manufacturing refers to a process by which 3D CAD data is 
used to construct an object in successive layers by depositing material. It is known 
as layer-upon-layer manufacturing. It may be regarded as a process whereby solid 
objects are constructed using additive techniques to lay down successive layers of a 
material until the object is completely made.

Additive manufacturing (AM) is also known as 3D printing, rapid prototyping, 
free form fabrication, or direct digital manufacturing (DDM). Although AM and 3D 
printing are not the same, both terms are used interchangeably. The term “3D print­
ing” refers specifically to additive manufacturing processes that use a printer-like 
head for deposition of the material. AM is the industrial version of 3D printing, and 
it is growing at an incredible pace due to its potentially lower cost and flexibility.
AM technologies typically include a computer, 3D modeling software (computer-­
aided design or CAD), a machine, and material. The AM machine reads in data from 
the CAD file and develops successive layers of the material in a layer-upon-layer 
manner to fabricate the desired 3D object. The process involves using a computer 
and CAD software to relay messages to the printer so that it “prints” out the 
desired object.
AM is a digitally driven manufacturing process. The AM technology can take on 
any of the following five (5) distinct approaches [5]: (1) spray forming, using spray­
ing equipment which is similar to the ink jet printer; (2) laminated object manufac­
turing, which consists of a computer, raw materials stored, and fed mechanism; (3) 
photosensitive polymer curing molding, which projects each layer image onto the 
liquid photosensitive polymer surface and solidifies every layer instantly; (4) mate­
rials extrusion molding, which builds the three-dimensional structure by means of 
accumulation, point to point, line by line, and layer by layer; and (5) laser powder 
sintering molding, which forms the required shape by bonding or fusing the powder 
material through thermal energy.
Additive manufacturing is really useful for the following general applications [6]:
•	 Complex Shapes: Many 3D printers can replicate fairly complex geometries 
and shapes.
8.2  What Is Additive Manufacturing?

112
•	 Prototyping: 3D printers have emerged as a prototyping method. It can produce 
prototypes using various materials with greater precision.
•	 Availability: 3D printing is becoming more accessible and affordable.
•	 Software: Advances in CAD software and 3D imaging have helped uncomplicate 
the design process.
8.3  Additive Manufacturing Processes

•	 Powder Bed Fusion: This process uses lasers, electron beams, or thermal print 
heads to melt ultrafine layers of material in a three-dimensional space. The pow­
der bed fusion (PBF) technology is used in a variety of AM processes.
•	 Binder Jetting: This process uses a 3D printer style head that lays down and 
moves on the x, y, and z axes in order to alternate layers of material and a liquid 
binder. It can print a variety of materials including metals, sands, and ceramics.

8  Additive Manufacturing

113
Unlike other additive techniques, binder jetting does not heat during the build 
process and can print large parts.
•	 Material Extrusion: This is perhaps the most well-known additive manufactur­
ing process. The nozzle moves horizontally, while the bed moves vertically, 
allowing the melted material to be built layer upon layer. Material extrusion is 
somewhat restricted in the types of shapes that can be created.
•	 Directed Energy Deposition: This process is similar to material extrusion, and it 
can be used with a wider variety of materials, including polymers, ceramics, and 
metals. It uses an electron beam gun or a laser that is mounted on a multi-­
axis arm.
•	 Material Jetting: In this process, a print head moves back and forth, much like 
the head on a 2D inkjet printer.
•	 Sheet Lamination: This process involves bonding sheets of material together 
layer by layer to form a single object. Laminated object manufacturing (LOM) 
and ultrasonic additive manufacturing (UAM) are two sheet lamination methods. 
LOM uses alternate layers of paper and adhesive, while UAM employs thin 
metal sheets conjoined through ultrasonic welding.
•	 Vat Polymerization: This process uses a vat of liquid photopolymer resin to con­
struct an object layer by layer.
8.4  Applications
AM applications appear limitless. 3D printing or AM has been used in several 
domains such as medicine, construction, retail, defense, pharmacy, automotive 
industry, aerospace, electronics, food industry, engineering, education, architecture, 
and entertainment [5].
•	 Aerospace: The automotive and aerospace industries are the two main manufac­
turing beneficiaries of AM. AM technology is popular in aerospace/aviation 
industry because it can easily produce the lightweight and long-life components. 
In aerospace field, the rapid additive manufacturing of composites is currently 
the norm. AM is used in the aerospace industry to create hinges, brackets, inte­
rior components, and airframe designs in order to improve fuel efficiency. 
Aerospace companies are investing in AM technology to redesign parts to reduce 
weight, increase efficiency, reduce material waste, and combine parts—thereby 
reducing the number of items in complex assemblies. Hundreds of airline parts 
can be manufactured on an industrial 3D printer. It is particularly noteworthy and 
of some mild concern that aerospace would be an industry to embrace AM, given 
the tough industry performance standards which must be met as aerospace parts 
are often operating in some of the harshest conditions.
•	 Automotive: Additive manufacturing has enabled the automotive industry to cre­
ate lighter and safer products. The automotive industry uses AM for rapid proto­
typing to experience reduced lead times and a reduction in costs. AM can be 
8.4  Applications

114
found in various finished vehicle products such as in battery covers, air condi­
tioner ducts, spare parts, and front bumpers.
•	 Medicine: The main applications of AM technology in medical/healthcare indus­
try include orthopedics, plastic surgery, surgical implants, tissue engineering, 
and regenerative medicine. AM is used for fabrication of orthopedic implants, 
biomaterials, tissues, and organs. AM can construct patient-matched implants. It 
reduces the cost of production, development, and cycle time and enables rapid 
product fabrication. Advances in printable biomaterial and AM technologies 
allow the fabrication of vascularized tissue constructs. AM also makes opera­
tions faster, cost-efficient, and more accurate than manual processes. A few items 
that AM is used to create are dental prosthetics such as crowns, bone defects 
repair through customized implants, and custom fit masks [9].
•	 Food Industry: AM has two key strengths, geometric complexity and economy at 
low volume of production, and these translate into food applications. Its ability 
to produce items in small batches allows for customization. The key motivators 
for 3D printing of food products are customization, on-demand production, and 
geometric complexity. For additive manufacturing to be successful, it must inte­
grate easily with traditional food production [10]. AM is being used in the food 
industry for squeezing out food, layer by layer, into three-dimensional objects. 
This applies to a variety of foods such as candy, crackers, pasta, and pizza.
•	 Electronics: Additive manufacturing has the potential to accelerate the pace of 
electronics manufacturing since it enables faster prototyping. It has been applied 
in fabricating active electronic components such as transistors, light-emitting 
diodes (LEDs), batteries, and operational amplifiers. (Transistors are important 
electronic components used in virtually all electronic devices.) These compo­
nents usually require highly elaborate fabrication processes due to their complex 
functionalities [11]. Today AM is used for mass production of consumer elec­
tronics devices.
•	 Military: The military is getting more interested in additive manufacturing. It 
could offer them an efficient way to replace components when necessary. The 
US Department of Defense is considering additive manufacturing technologies 
to rapidly prototype and build equipment components. The US Naval Research 
Laboratory uses 3D printing to develop items for radar technology. With 3D 
printing, there exists a proven and reliable system on naval ships to make devices 
or replacements on an ad hoc basis.
•	 Automation: Automation can help maximize operational efficiencies, drive lean 
practices, eliminate redundancies, and simplify manufacturing processes. To 
automate AM technologies, companies are now beginning to implement robotic 
solutions to automate production. According to this concept, a robot will handle 
most of the process steps, such as feeding the printer with build boxes and then 
removing them for post-processing. The goal is to eliminate all manual work to 
facilitate continuous, high-volume production.
•	 Energy: The success of AM in the energy sector is similar to that it has enjoyed 
in the aerospace industry. As it enables the rapid development of relatively high 
8  Additive Manufacturing

115
strength, low weight custom-designed components are able to withstand extreme 
conditions.
Other areas of application include fashion designing, passive microwave compo­
nents such as waveguides, couplers, power dividers, filters, and antennas), architec­
tural design, civil engineering, and weapons development.
8.5  Benefits
Additive manufacturing technologies differ from traditional or subtractive manufac­
turing technologies. They have some advantages and disadvantages. They are 
changing both how and what can be manufactured. The strengths of additive manu­
facturing lie where conventional manufacturing reaches its limitations.
The demand in the global 3D printing market is gaining traction due to the fol­
lowing reasons [12]:
•	 The costs of 3D printers are falling.
•	 The geometric limits imposed by subtractive manufacturing no longer exist.
•	 It is possible to create multiple versions of the same product.
•	 A drastic reduction of processing waste is obtained.
•	 Strikingly higher resolution.
•	 Ease in the development of customized products.
•	 Growing possibilities of using multiple materials for printing.
•	 Government investments in 3D printing projects.
•	 Lower energy consumption.
•	 Less waste.
•	 Less dedicated tooling.
•	 Reduced development costs and time to market.
•	 Innovative designs and geometries.
•	 Part consolidation (fewer parts with more complex design).
•	 Customization of parts (e.g., for medical implants, spare parts).
Other benefits of additive manufacturing include the following [13]:
•	 Flexibility: Perhaps the most important benefit is their high design flexibility. 
The greater range of shapes which can be produced. AM enables a design-driven 
manufacturing process. It provides a high degree of design freedom, resulting in 
the manufacture of small shape sizes at reasonable unit costs.
•	 Prototyping: Additive manufacturing has revolutionized production with rapid 
prototyping. It enables quick prototyping and reduces the lead time and cost of 
developing prototypes. AM technology has made it easier and affordable for 
small companies and individuals to develop a customized prototype. AM enables 
companies to do what otherwise would be very difficult or impossible.
•	 Complex Shape Capability: Additive manufacturing allows for highly complex 
structures. It allows one to produce the objects without machining, lathing, mill­
8.5  Benefits

116
 
ing, grinding, boring, casting, or welding. AM has made possible the creation of 
objects that were previously very difficult or impossible to make with traditional 
manufacturing. The process is a faster way to make complex objects because the 
machines can run 24/7.
•	 Faster Production: Additive manufacturing offers production techniques that are 
faster than traditional ones. It is not a far-fetched idea to use AM in fabricating 
electronic devices in faster and in less expensive ways than current methods 
allow. Conventional methods such as injection molding can be less expensive for 
manufacturing polymer products, but additive manufacturing can be faster, more 
flexible, and less expensive.
•	 Minimal Material Wasted: A drastic reduction of processing waste is obtained. 
This makes AM more cost-effective, ultimately saving money.
8.5
8.6  Challenges
There are issues that need to be addressed in order to make AM technology appli­
cable for large-scale production. Understanding the difference between traditional 
and additive technologies is a challenge. AM systems have only become useful for 
mass production to a limited extent. It is still challenging to use AM on a larger 
scale. Industrial robots are often used along with AM technologies for producing 
large components. From industry viewpoint, the following eighteen barriers have 
8  Additive Manufacturing

117
been identified [14]: education, cost, design, software, materials, traceability, 
machine constraints, in-process monitoring, mechanical properties, repeatability, 
scalability, validation, standards, quality, inspection, tolerances, finishing, and ster­
ilization. Some of these challenges are explained as follows [6, 15–19]:
•	 Cost: The greatest obstacle in implementing AM is the high price of the equip­
ment. 3D printers are not cost-effective in most manufacturing situations. The 
needed materials can be expensive, so producing a large part may seem to be a 
waste of time.
•	 Materials: The raw materials used in additive manufacturing are still limited, 
mainly to plastics.
•	 Low Speed: Layers of material are gradually added to create the part in 3D print­
ing. The larger the part, the longer the process takes.
•	 Strength and Finish: The layers of material create stratification. This process cre­
ates a rough surface finish, which must go through additional processing to 
obtain the desired feel.
•	 Technical Limitations: 3D printing is not fast enough to replace high-speed man­
ufacturing processes, and it lacks flexibility in material use. The software needed 
to create a 3D file is still far too complex for an average person. 3D printing 
started with plastics and is still primarily done with plastics. AM with metals is 
more challenging due to their higher melting points and higher amount of energy 
required.
•	 Security: AM is a rapidly becoming a multibillion dollar industry. This makes 
AM an attractive attack target. There is substantial concern for the security of the 
storage, transfer, and execution of 3D models across digital networks. As addi­
tive manufacturing technology evolves so will the cybersecurity risk of tamper­
ing and misuse of designs. Security approaches for this emerging technology 
should to be addressed before the technology becomes more widely adopted.
•	 Ownership and Copying: This is important for intellectual property of designs. 
The question of ownership and copying of original ideas has sparked consider­
able debate and interest. AM offers new opportunities for counterfeiting prod­
ucts. For this reason, the government has introduced difficult-to-duplicate 
materials and designs into currency. The possibility of the rapid replication of 
highly sophisticated tools could vastly expand the number of persons able to 
commit violent acts or wage war.
•	 Ethical Issues: AM poses some ethical challenges for militaries and govern­
ments, who are responsible for keeping war-making tools out of the wrong 
hands. There is a current lack in the diversity of materials able to be processed 
using AM techniques. Other challenges include lack of industry standards, not 
suitable for mass production, and limited number of materials.
•	 Lack of Standards: The lack of 3D printing standards remains a major bottleneck 
slowing down its wider adoption. It is beneficial if the industry has standards 
which are universally understood and accepted. In manufacturing, standards are 
essential for raw materials, machines, equipment operators, engineers, suppliers, 
and the manufacturing process itself. Standards facilitate part design, and the 
8.6  Challenges

118
approval and certification of processes and standards promote adoption among 
engineers in the industry. Standards developing organizations, like ISO and 
ASTM, have issued a few specifications on metal powders like nickel, titanium, 
and stainless steel. AM standardization is on a promising path.
•	 Lack of Skilled Labor: AM requires engineers to develop a set of skills to support 
it; processes are required before and after. Currently, there are not enough AM 
engineers.
These shortcomings make AM several steps away from replacing current assem­
bly lines of traditional manufacturing. As AM heads toward mass production, it 
needs to be environment-friendly and energy-efficient in order to be self-­
sustainable [20].
8.7  Global Adoption of Additive Manufacturing
Additive manufacturing is regarded as the next revolution in materials technology. 
It is receiving significant global attention. Much of the world continues to think of 
AM technology as a convenient way to make plastic objects from 3D printers. 
Several businesses across the world are now considering additive manufacturing for 
their supply chain. Some nations are using their own AM initiatives to help shape 
the manufacturing industry. Currently, the USA and Europe dominate the AM mar­
ket, with some excellent work in Singapore, China, and Israel, among others. We 
consider how some regions adopt additive manufacturing.
•	 United States: In November 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) released 
its first Additive Manufacturing Roadmap. The military personnel have been 
pushing its limits far beyond what most imagined possible. The Oak Ridge 
National Laboratory produced the military’s first 3D-printed submarine hull 
[21]. GE uses key applications to showcase its AM offerings. The auto giant is 
already printing jet engine parts in commercial aircraft. Its additive manufactur­
ing division specializes in developing powder bed fusion (PBF) machines for the 
additive manufacturing of metal parts.
•	 United Kingdom: In the United Kingdom, the AM-UK Steering Group has pre­
sented the AM-UK National Strategy, which includes brief summaries of the 
challenges facing industry. The strategy maps out how to overcome challenges in 
the following areas: cost/investment/financing, design, IP, protection and secu­
rity, materials and processes, skills/education, standards and certification, and 
test and validation [14].

8.8  Conclusion
Additive manufacturing is regarded as a layer-upon-layer manufacturing. Although 
additive manufacturing is still in its infancy, it has the potential to revolutionize 
manufacturing. It will take manufacturing to the next level. It will lead to home 
manufacturing. It has been introduced in many companies worldwide. Some regard 
it as a game changer for the manufacturing industry. Do not allow your organization 
to be left in the dark ages by not adopting additive manufacturing.
Additive manufacturing is shaping the future of the manufacturing industry and 
becoming a mainstream manufacturing process. The field has a bright future. It 
provides a clear competitive advantage to customers [24]. Additive Manufacturing 
2.0 is a wave of next-generation additive manufacturing technologies that will 
unlock throughput, repeatability, and competitive part costs. For more information 
on the AM field, one should consult the books in [7, 25–39] and the following inter­
national journals that exclusively devoted it:

Green Manufacturing
9.1  Introduction
Manufacturing has been a major source of resource consumption and environmental 
pollution. It is well-known as the largest sector of the American economy. It is 
closely connected with all other sectors like mining, trading, transportation, supply 
chain, and financial services. It contributes to the economy by providing many job 
opportunities, creating wealth, eradicating poverty, and providing better life stan­
dards, healthcare, and education [1]. However, the rapid technological advance­
ments have led to a growing concern for environmental degradation caused by the 
manufacturing sector. The manufacturing sector accounts for a significant portion of 
the world’s consumption of resources and generation of waste. It has negatively 
impacted the environment through the over-exploitation of natural resources and 
pollution. The manufacturing industry’s energy demand is one-third of the total 
energy consumption in the United States [2]. To minimize the environmental dam­
age due to manufacturing requires a new manufacturing process.
Green manufacturing (GM), also known as environmentally conscious manufac­
turing, is a new trend for the future development of the manufacturing industry. It is 
the embodiment of the strategy for sustainable development of the manufacturing 
sector. Green manufacturing refers to modern manufacturing that makes products 
without pollution. It alleviates the current contradiction between industrial develop­
ment and environmental degradation and pollution. It addresses a wide range of 
environmental and sustainability issues including resource selection, transportation, 
manufacturing process, and pollution. This new way of thinking about manufactur­
ing is having a big impact on manufacturers worldwide as they realize the many 
financial benefits of adhering to sustainable principles [3, 4].
This chapter provides a brief introduction to green manufacturing, an area of 
great importance for current and future manufacturing operations. It begins with 
traditional manufacturing concepts and then describes what GM is all about. It 
Meeting the needs of the present without compromising the 
ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Green manufacturing is different from traditional manufacturing in that it focuses 
on environmental impact, environment policies of governments, and national and 
international environmental regulations. Green manufacturing is an advanced, mod­
ern manufacturing approach that comprehensively considers the environmental 
influence and the resources consumption.

Green manufacturing is a philosophy rather than a process. It is an important 
aspect of a circular economy. The objective of green manufacturing is to reduce 
environmental waste and pollution. It can be applied in all manufacturing sectors 
that minimize waste and pollution and conserve resources. Green manufacturing is 
an effective way to protect resources and the environment and conserve the resources 
for future generation. It is a key step toward achieving the big goal of 
sustainability.

9.4  Motivations for Green Manufacturing
In order to stay competitive, manufacturing companies are expected to implement 
green manufacturing and increase product complexity. This is becoming essential in 
the eyes of customers, investors, and authorities. Failure to comply may lead to 
fines, penalties, and customers choosing to go to the competitors.
For conceptual and common drivers of the philosophy of green manufacturing, 
different terms, such as “critical indicators,” “critical success factors,” “enablers,” 
“focus areas,” “motives,” and “motivators,” are used synonymously. The twelve 
common drivers of GM include financial benefits, company image, environmental 
conservation, compliance with regulations, stakeholders, green innovation, supply 
chain requirements, customers, employee demands, internal motivations, market 
trends, and competitors. Commitment from the top-level management is the most 
critical factor in the implementation of green manufacturing [11].
The manufacturing industry is motivated to adopt green manufacturing practices 
to reduce environmental impact and improve economic performance. Such prac­
tices include pollution prevention, product stewardship, and emission control. There 
are a number of factors that motivate the manufacturing industry to implement 
green manufacturing. These factors can be grouped into three categories of regula­
tory pressure, economic incentives, and competitive advantages. These factors 
include [12]:
•	 Pressure from the government—regulations and tax benefits
•	 Access to government incentives
•	 Increase sales
9.4  Motivations for Green Manufacturing

128
•	 Save money on energy costs
•	 Boost employers’ morale
•	 Interest in efficiency
•	 Scarcity of resources
•	 Pressure from society/consumers and competitors
•	 Desire to maintain market leadership
•	 Ensure control of supply chain effects
US governmental agencies have developed a series of policies, regulations, and 
laws, which have achieved significant progress in advancing the environmental per­
formance of manufacturers. These governmental efforts compel the manufacturing 
industry to consider green manufacturing as the economic benefits which could 
result from the implementation of sustainability programs. For example, the US 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has the responsibility for evaluating the 
safety and efficacy of new drugs.
International organizations such as the United Nations, World Bank, and the 
Carbon War Room are making notable progress to promote green manufacturing. 
Stakeholders, customers, and the government are increasingly asking companies to 
be more environmentally responsible with respect to their products and processes. 
Their reasons for this requirement include regulatory requirements, product stew­
ardship, public image, and potential competitive advantages.

•	 Reduce: This requires decreasing the consumption of resources (e.g., energies, 
water, materials) and emission of wastes including atmospheric pollutions, e.g., 
carbon emissions, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and photo­
chemical smog.
•	 Reuse: This requires reusing the products with the aim of prolonging the life of 
the products and reducing waste.
•	 Recycle: There are two ways of recycling. One of which produces the same kind 
of new products, while the other is when recycling is transferred into raw materi­
als of other products.
•	 Remanufacturing: This is an approach to recover the old products back to the 
ones close to the new products.

9.6  Green Manufacturing Practices
­
9.7 14
•	 Green Resources: Green manufacturing uses energy, water, materials, and other 
resources more efficiently thereby reducing the overall impact on the environ­
ment. Workers use fewer natural resources. Using fewer natural resources to 
make the same product saves money. Workers may generate electricity from 
renewable sources which include wind, biomass, geothermal, solar, ocean, and 
hydropower. Green energy may be regarded as an environmental strategy, a 
national security strategy, or an economic strategy.
•	 Green Design: This is also known as environment-conscious design or product 
lifecycle design. Green design focuses on developing eco-friendly products that 
minimize waste. It considers the environmental factors and measures pollution 
prevention in the product design phase. Product designer needs to consider the 
manufacturability of the product, the energy consumption, the maintainability, 
and the reusability of the product [15]. If environmental protection is considered 
at the design stage of a product, pollution can be easily reduced to the minimum. 
Manufacturing companies need to shift toward using cleaner energy.
•	 Green Production: Green technologies focus on reducing the impact of manufac­
turing processes at every stage of production. Companies should stay ahead of 
the curve on sustainability and evaluate how green are the products, ­technologies, 
resources, and energy. The selection of raw materials directly dictates the realiza­
tion of green production. A growing range of green products, ranging from 
organic food products to electric cars, are being offered by companies to custom­
ers [16]. By developing green products that are demanded by consumers, compa­
nies can derive additional sales that can offset their cost of development. Green

products save energy, reduce energy consumption, and increase the company’s 
competitive advantage.
•	 Green Manufacturing: Green manufacturing considers the impact of product 
development, manufacturing, and activity on the environment. This assures sus­
tainability in resource extraction, material processing, product use, and disposal. 
The green manufacturing process obeys the following five principles [17]: (1) 
least resources consumption principle, (2) least energy consumption principle, 
(3) least environment pollution principle, (4) better labor protection principle, 
and (5) economic efficiency principle.
•	 Green Disposal: Green disposal aims to reduce e-waste by repairing, redeploy­
ing, disposing, refurbishing, retaining, and reusing of outdated IT hardware. 
Reducing resource use, waste, and pollution, along with recycling and reusing 
waste, yields benefits. Waste is whatever does not add value to the end product. 
To achieve green disposal, the release of toxic substances in product life is not 
allowed. Overproduction, which is a form of waste, is also disallowed, which 
occurs when production output exceeds actual customer orders.

9.7  Green Manufacturing Strategies
Green manufacturing is decidedly a philosophy for manufacturing that minimizes 
waste and pollution through product and process design. The main objective of 
green manufacturing is sustainability. Sustainable trend is becoming crucial in all 
aspects of manufacturing. Today, manufacturers must keep the environment in mind 
at each step of their product lifecycle. To go green, one should consider the follow­
ing manufacturing strategies [18]:
	 1.	 Design for disassembly, remanufacture, or reuse.
	 2.	 Rethink product and process technology.
	 3.	 Streamline the supply chain.
	 4.	 Reduce energy and water consumption.
	 5.	 Choose recyclable or biodegradable materials and packaging.
	 6.	 Integrate environmental costs into the organization’s production budget.
	 7.	 Use ISO 14001 standard as a jumping-off point.
	 8.	 Find a reverse logistics supply vendor.
	 9.	 Invest in business intelligence/analytics.
	10.	 Redesign all scales of manufacturing flow.
	11.	 Shift to a service-oriented business.
Some organizations have started developing competitive GM strategies. This 
enhances the image of companies in the eyes of the customer and their competitive­
ness. Green manufacturing strategic patterns adopted by ISO 14001 certificate hold­
ers in Jordan were agile, lean, and caretaker strategic patterns. The green strategic 
patterns are the milestones of the green practices’ success. The effectiveness of 
adopted green strategies is yet to be determined [19].
9.8  Applications of Green Manufacturing
Green manufacturing refers to the new manufacturing paradigm that employs vari­
ous green strategies and techniques to become more eco-efficient. It is a modern 
manufacturing approach that gives due consideration to environmental impact and 
resource consumption. It seems to be an effective way to achieve sustainable manu­
facturing development. This new green manufacturing paradigm is an outcome of 
market and technological drivers. It may also be regarded as an important compo­
nent of green business. Additive manufacturing or 3D printer technologies needs to 
be considered as a practical green process because of saving in materials and reduc­
tion in processing steps.
Interest in green manufacturing is increasing more and gaining traction within 
industrial communities [20]. The following are typical applications of GM across a 
broad range of industries [21].
9.8  Applications of Green Manufacturing

132
•	 Automotive Industry: The automotive industry has become indispensable, and it 
plays a vital role in the national economy. The industry is based on the great 
consumption of resources and energy to meet the mobility needs of the masses, 
while the continuous and incremental disposal of end-of-life vehicles leads to 
severe pollution [13].
•	 Semiconductor Industry: The production of semiconductor/electronic products 
(such as instruments, radio, TV, radars, computers, mobile phones) consumes a 
great deal of resources as well as generates harmful wastes during their 
production.
•	 Iron and Steel Industry: This is an essential industry in the national economy, but 
it consumes raw materials to produce iron and steel. Steel is the world’s leading 
industrial product. Traditionally, the steel industry produces iron oxide and car­
bon, leading to large carbon emissions. One way to improve environmental 
friendliness of iron and steel is to deploy source control strategies with the intent 
of reducing iron and steel consumption by-products of industrial and atmo­
spheric pollution. Green manufacturing can be adopted to manage iron and steel 
production [22].
•	 Pharmaceuticals Industry: The pharmaceuticals industry fabricates chemical 
products and receives strict regulatory oversight to protect the public from unsafe 
pharmaceutical products. For example, paint and pigment manufacturing indus­
tries generate large quantities of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes resulting in 
ill-health effects and chronic health conditions including tumorous and cancer­
ous effects. Reducing waste should be a high priority for this manufactur­
ing sector.
•	 Transportation: Transportation consumes much of the earth’s resources. It is key 
to greening global industries. A basic change in vehicle design, including pow­
ertrain and propulsion systems design, noise, and emissions control, is necessary. 
It will reduce emissions, fuel consumption, and cost. Electric vehicles, fuel cells, 
and biodiesel are some examples of this category. Governments around the world 
are tightening the regulations on emissions caused by transportation.
•	 Textile Industry: This industry gathers the agricultural, chemical fiber, textile, 
apparel, retail, service, and waste management sectors. Antibacterial textile 
structure is used as a potential replacement for synthetic fabrics or cotton fabrics. 
Carpet industry is an early environmental mover within the textile industry. It is 
advanced with respect to sustainable manufacturing practices [23, 24].
•	 Computer Industry: Apple is optimizing the energy efficiency of its hardware 
tools. Motorola improves recyclability, minimizes packing, and reduces hazard­
ous materials. All Samsung vendor facilities desire to be 1SO 14,000 compliant.
•	 Cement Industry: Cement manufacturing uses a lot of energy and produces air 
emissions like nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, carbon dioxide, hydrochloric acid 
vapor, and chlorine. The pollution from the cement industry will keep increasing 
because of the increased demand for new houses. There is a need for controlling 
the environmental concerns raised by the cement industry through green manu­
facturing practices adoption [25].
9  Green Manufacturing

133
•	 Other Companies: Other companies that have taken similar measures include 
GM, Ford, IBM, IKEA, Dell, Johnson & Johnson, and Nike. WalMart, the 
world’s largest retailer, is betting on hybrid technology to power its truck fleet.
Other applications that could benefit from the green revolution include renew­
able energy systems, green chemistry avoidance of toxins, furniture industry, textile 
industry, carpet industry, foundry industry, air products industry, and the oil and gas 
industry.
9.9  Awareness of GM
The awareness of GM is crucial to its adoption. In order to adopt and implement 
GM, it is important for society to be aware of its significance. There is no doubt that 
GM can be easily accepted and supported by the populace, the government, and 
nonprofit organizations. Awareness about green manufacturing must be improved 
through education. Everyone associated with the business must be involved in 
adopting green manufacturing, including suppliers, customers, and employees. 
Training and education programs are thus essential for employees. Students and 
workers in manufacturing must learn about green manufacturing, sustainability 
concepts, and practices such as [26]:
	1.	 Energy from Renewable Sources: Workers may generate electricity from renew­
able sources such as wind, biomass, geothermal, solar, ocean, hydropower, etc.
	2.	 Energy Efficiency. Workers will utilize specific technologies and practices to 
improve energy efficiency. More energy-efficient technologies will help in using 
renewable energy and protect the world from climate change.
	3.	 Pollution Reduction: Workers will use green technologies and practices to reduce 
the generation of pollutants. Manufacturers must take all reasonable steps to 
eliminate pollution.
	4.	 Natural Resources Conservation: Workers will use specific technologies and 
practices to conserve natural resources such as land, water, etc. With resources 
becoming scarcer due to depletions and exploitations, it is imperative to reduce 
waste by minimizing natural resource use and recycling.
Organizations can assess the commitment of the top management to GM in terms 
of the availability of an explicit environmental policy, availability of effective strate­
gies to achieve the policy, and allocation of financial resources [27].
9.10  Benefits
GM is regarded as the winning strategy to be adopted by manufacturers worldwide.
Successful adoption of green manufacturing will bring many benefits (economic 
benefits, environmental benefits, and social benefits) both tangible and intangible 
9.10  Benefits

134
for each nation and the international business community. Manufacturing compa­
nies will adopt green manufacturing if they realize that it will result in some finan­
cial benefits. Green manufacturing can mitigate air, water, and land pollution. It 
reduces waste at the source and minimizes health risks to humans. Other benefits of 
green manufacturing include [28–31]:
•	 Reduce Costs: The costs associated with manufacturing can be reduced through 
sustainability initiatives. Green manufacturing can be practiced by reducing the 
cost of raw materials, which is achievable by using less energy and reusing recy­
cled wastes instead of buying new materials for production [2]. Perhaps the larg­
est payoff of the green manufacturing approach is energy savings since energy 
costs are a major prime concern for manufacturers.
•	 Reduce Consumption of Resources: The manufacturing industry is responsible 
for significant resources and energy consumption. Green manufacturing helps to 
reduce resource use, waste, and pollution, along with recycling and reusing what 
was formerly viewed as waste.
•	 Reduce Waste: Waste consumes resources without adding any advantage to the 
product. Manufacturing does not have to be a wasteful or uneconomical process. 
Reducing industrial waste should be a top priority for manufacturing leaders, 
policymakers, and decision-makers in order to save our planet. An important 
aspect of environmental sustainability is reducing waste. The reduction in waste 
production delivers broad-based and far-reaching benefits more than the 
environment.
•	 Reduce Pollution: Manufacturing activities have been one of the major polluters 
of the environment. Green manufacturing primarily reduces or removes the 
release of pollutants in manufacturing operations, conserves energy and natural 
resources, and makes safer products for consumers.
•	 Tax Incentives: There are tax incentives at the federal and state levels for green 
manufacturers. The incentives can be leveraged to invest in new technologies.
•	 Environmental Friendliness: Every non-sustainable measure impacts the envi­
ronment. A company can help the environment by simply optimizing existing 
operations and reducing agents of environmental degradation.
•	 Adherence to Compliance Regulations: Creating and implementing a sustain­
ability strategy is the only long-term solution companies have, to avoid possible 
compliance violations. Increasing environmental demands from governmental 
agencies and customers emphasizes the need for companies to improve their 
environmental performance.
•	 Energy Efficiency: Green practices can be used to improve energy efficiency 
within an establishment. They minimize energy use in production.
•	 Stability: One of the best benefits of green manufacturing is that it improves the 
long-term stability of an enterprise. Companies are now starting to become more 
conscious of the environment, and so are customers. A great need exists, to align 
organizations with the new trends, in order to survive in the future.
•	 Reputation Boost: As consumers show interest in sustainability, launching busi­
nesses into the green manufacturing and clean energy arena can be a great repu­
9  Green Manufacturing

135
tation boost that will increase overall business sales and profits. When companies 
go green, it shows in their customer response.
•	 Societal Impact: Going green can make a company more marketable. Future 
generations will benefit from improved air and water quality and more eco-­
friendly and renewable energy sources.
•	 Increase Employee Morale: GM yields benefits not only in terms of an improved 
bottom line, but in terms of employee motivation, morale, and public relations. 
When employees work together to implement green initiatives, it increases 
workforce morale and fosters a culture of teamwork.
•	 Attracting New Employees: One way to appeal to the next generation of workers 
is to demonstrate your commitment to the greening of the environment.
•	 Attract New Customers: Green practices can make your company more market­
able, resulting in increased sales.
•	 Global Demand: Environmentally conscious manufacturing processes have 
become an obligation to the environment and to the society. Stakeholders includ­
ing regulators, customers, shareholders, board members, and employees are 
increasingly demanding companies to be more environmentally responsible with 
respect to their products. Their reasons include regulatory requirements, product 
stewardship, enhanced public image, potential to expand customer base, and 
potential competitive advantages [23].
9.8
­
9.11  Challenges
In spite of the many benefits that green manufacturing offers to the environmental 
problems, it is facing some challenges including [32]:
•	 Global Competition: It can be difficult for companies to implement green manu­
facturing cost-effectively. It is challenging to compete with companies overseas 
that do not abide by the same standards and are therefore able to keep their oper­
ating costs low, thereby securing unfair competitive advantages.
•	 Lack of Required Skills: Green manufacturing jobs require a strong core skillset 
and an added layer of green knowledge. There is lack of required skills and short­
age of financial resources.
•	 Measuring Greenness: The conventional manufacturing wisdom suggests that 
we cannot improve what cannot be measured. There is the challenge of measur­
ing manufacturing greenness level. There is a need for developing metrics that 
track and monitor the performance of GM. A toolbox (Greenometer) to assess 
the greenness level of manufacturing companies has been proposed. Greenometer 
offers relative greenness assessment among different industries [33].
•	 Many companies are still skeptical about the business benefits of GM.
9.11  Challenges

136
 
•	 Ascertaining the costs of embarking on green manufacturing.
•	 Lack of capable scientifically based decision support tools for effective imple­
mentation of GM.
•	 GM often requires the use of more expensive materials and technologies.
•	 The rate at which green manufacturing systems are being implemented is not 
keeping pace with the global expansion of the manufacturing industry.
•	 Assessing the performance of green manufacturing.
•	 Increase in production cost attributable to GM.
•	 The life cycle cost of product in green manufacturing is lower than that of the 
same product in traditional manufacturing.
Green manufacturing will have more benefits and challenges in the years to come.
9.12  Global Impact of Green Manufacturing
Green manufacturing essentially achieves two things: manufacturing of “green” 
products and “greening” of manufacturing, in which workers use fewer natural 
resources, reduce pollution, minimize waste, and recycle and reuse materials. It has 
attracted the attention of industries all over the world, and consumers are 
demanding it.
Manufacturing companies worldwide are now more conscious about greening 
the environment. The global manufacturing is no longer only concerned with the 
competition for sources, capital, and labor but also with the competitiveness of 
green technology. A lot of companies all over the world claim to be “going green.” 
The United States and European Union are leaders in the implementation of envi­
ronmentally conscious production. Examples of companies that are making strides 
in sustainable/green manufacturing include Coca-Cola, BMW, GM, Ford, Motorola, 
Toyota, Tesla, IBM, Dell, Siemens, Samsung, Apple, Nike, Johnson & Johnson, and 
9  Green Manufacturing

Tupperware. We now consider how different nations implement green 
manufacturing.
•	 United States: Over 70 percent of Americans regard manufacturing as the most 
important industry in the American economy. From retail to utilities, the manu­
facturing industry is closely connected with all other thriving industries across 
the nation. The United States remains the world’s largest manufacturing econ­
omy, producing 21% of global manufactured products. A strong US manufactur­
ing sector requires that the government policymakers enact stronger US 
government policies and incentives that promote and foster its ongoing develop­
ment and growth. Industrial leaders have urged the government to enact policies 
and take actions to revitalize US manufacturing. By the same token, govern­
ments and nongovernment organizations have been urging manufacturers to 
clean up their act and take greater responsibility for resource use, waste, and 
pollution [3]. Manufacturers in the United States are turning toward sustainable 
alternatives to boost competitive advantage and increase revenue.
•	 China: China, as the biggest manufacturing nation, is taking great pains in prac­
ticing green manufacturing. The automotive industry has become one of the 
Chinese pillar industries. Although the industry creates wealth and job employ­
ment, it makes a significant impact on the environment. Manufacturing in China 
is facing severe challenges. China has been ramping up its green manufacturing 
initiatives. As China scales its manufacturing industries, it will create a large 
carbon footprint. Green manufacturing is one of the three development strategies 
for manufacturing industry in China. The adoption of green technology in the 
automotive industry has three aspects: green design, green processing, and green 
remanufacturing. The product design stage determines the type of materials and 
resources to be used. China is beginning to realize the concerns of global warm­
ing. China recently shut down 40% of its factories to minimize pollution. For 
example, in Beijing, 1000 manufacturing companies were shut down by 2020 as 
part of an initiative to reduce smog and waste. Beijing also plans to relocate all 
manufacturing and heavy industry companies. China may need outside technol­
ogy to reach its ambitious sustainability goals. To establish a green university, 
green engineering has priority in the program developed by Tsinghua University, 
in the support of the US “China Bridge” [34–36].
•	 Japan: Sustainable product and process engineering, green, lean design, manu­
facturing, management rules, and principles are offered with a focus on “mono­
zukuri.” The Japanese term “monozukuri” means sustainable, environmentally 
friendly, green factories and products with simultaneously integrated product 
and process designs [37]. For example, Toyota’s assembly plant generates green 
power from local landfill gas. The company’s Prius has come to symbolize green 
motoring in parts of the world.
•	 Europe Union: Europe pioneered the manufacture of the smart car, which has 
experienced a surge in popularity among environmentally conscious consumers. 
Smart cars are made using eco-friendly production methods, resulting in less 
production-related emissions and waste. For example, BMW promotes its green 
9.12  Global Impact of Green Manufacturing

manufacturing programs. The company replaces high-solvent paints with water-­
based ones when possible. Environmental protection is high on the agenda of 
Mercedes-Benz. Other automakers such as Ford, General Motors, Honda, and 
Chrysler have followed suit.
•	 India: Manufacturing is an important sector for India since it creates both job 
and wealth. Green manufacturing in India is at the take-off stage. The 
Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) is a nongovernment, not-for-profit orga­
nization that creates and maintains an environment conducive to the growth of 
the industry in India. With several offices located within and outside India, CII 
serves as a reference point for the Indian industry and the international business 
community. The Indian foundry industry is known as the fifth in the world. The 
foundry sector consumes a lot of energy [38].
•	 Ghana: Like other nations, the manufacturing sector plays a major role in the 
economy of Ghana. It provides job opportunities to skilled job seekers and also 
serves as a source of huge foreign exchange inflows. However, the adverse effect 
of manufacturing activities on the environment cannot be underestimated. 
Industrial toxic substances being released in Ghana have been from the indus­
tries such as food processing, mineral exploitation, petroleum handling, and the 
textile industry. Ghana has been taking steps toward creating a green economy 
through national policies, blueprints, and initiatives. A significant effort made 
toward preventing the adverse effect of industrial activities on the environment 
includes the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency of Ghana (EPA), 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), and the Switch Africa Green [39].
9.13  Conclusion
Green manufacturing has become the inevitable choice in the twenty-first-century 
manufacturing industry. It will increasingly be an important issue because it is a 
crucial component in the international effort toward “sustainable development.” It is 
the only realistic means of realizing modern manufacturing sustainable develop­
ment. For this reason, green manufacturing has received growing interest in the last 
few years. It is fast becoming a necessary business practice in the manufacturing 
industry. It is here to stay.
Green manufacturing will have a lot of benefits in the years to come. It is the 
important issue that manufacturing systems of the future must consider. There are 
various incentives, resources, and industry-specific organizations available to help 
manufacturing companies adopt green initiatives. As long as the benefits of being 
green outweigh the cost, the adoption of green practices will continue to be attrac­
tive and wise. More information about green manufacturing can be found in [12, 
40–46] and the journals devoted to it:

Sustainable Manufacturing
10.1  Introduction
Manufacturing is the main pillar of the modern society. It is a well-acknowledged 
fact that traditional manufacturing processes are generally designed for high perfor­
mance and low cost with little attention paid to environmental issues. Although 
manufacturing systems create material wealth, they consume a great amount of 
resources and generate a lot of waste, which is responsible for the degradation of the 
environment. Thus, such traditional manufacturing processes have retained the neg­
ative image of being inefficient, polluting, and harmful. Manufacturers are under 
pressure by regulations and consumers to reduce the environmental impact of their 
activities.
Today, humans are consuming natural resources through manufacturing activi­
ties at an alarming rate, which is not sustainable. For example, between 1950 and 
2005, worldwide metals production grew sixfold, oil consumption eightfold, and 
natural gas consumption 14-fold. The current assumption of unlimited resources 
and unlimited world’s capacity for regeneration is no longer acceptable. Thus, mini­
mizing the resource consumption and reducing the environmental impact of manu­
facturing systems has become very important [1].
Sustainable manufacturing (SM) is manufacturing products through economi­
cally sound processes that minimize negative environmental impacts while conserv­
ing energy and natural resources. The goal of sustainable manufacturing is to 
minimize waste, maximize resource efficiency, and reduce the environmental 
impact of manufacturing. It is imperative that manufacturing processes should con­
sider sustainability at every level, so that there will be comprehensive adherence to 
sustainability principles. Properly implemented, sustainable manufacturing can lead 
to several advantages.
This chapter describes sustainable manufacturing and how environmental sus­
tainability helps in achieving it. It begins by explaining the concept of sustainability. 
Sustainability is not only central to business strategy, but will 
increasingly become a critical driver of business growth. How 
well and how quickly businesses respond to this agenda will 
determine which companies succeed and which will fail.

It discusses what sustainable manufacturing is all about. It covers some sustainable 
approaches. It provides some examples of sustainable manufacturing. It highlights 
the benefits and challenges of SM. It covers the global adoption of SM. The last 
section concludes with comments.
10.2  The Concept of Sustainability
Sustainability is the future of manufacturing. It has been a keyword in the twenty-­
first century because it is one of the global grand challenges. For example, we hear 
about sustainable engineering, sustainable development, sustainable energy, sus­
tainable software, sustainable design, sustainable living, economic sustainability, 
social sustainability, ecological sustainability, etc. In this same way, there has been 
considerable discussion about green chemistry, green engineering, green business, 
green manufacturing, green food, green economy, green energy, etc. The two terms 
(sustainability and green) are often used interchangeably [2]. Sustainable develop­
ment has been a major driving initiative in engineering businesses throughout the 
world. Green engineering involves creating healthy living environments that use 
natural resources wisely and conservatively [3].

The four pillars of sustainability analysis are energy, efficiency, environment, 
and society. Sustainability analysis is multidisciplinary in nature. It requires 
approaches from different disciplines such as manufacturing engineering, environ­
mental engineering, optimization, social science, and finance. Sustainability starts 
with green manufacturing and extends to industrial networks and then to the ecosys­
tem. Sustainability of a system is its ability to survive and retain its functionality 
over time. A distinctly sustainable society is capable of surviving and prospering 
indefinitely [6].

•	 Environmental Sustainability: The earth’s resources and processes are connected 
with human societies. Environmental sustainability describes a possible way that 
human societies can sustainably develop by living within the system earth and 
using the resources of planet earth. It is focused on three protection goals: protec­
tion of human health, resources, and the ecosystem.
10.2  The Concept of Sustainability

144
•	 Economic Sustainability: This addresses effective investments, finance, job cre­
ation, and competitiveness.
•	 Social Sustainability: This addresses equity, justice, security, employment, and 
participation.
New technology, new business practices, and new lifestyle models will be the 
cornerstones of the new sustainable world. Four sustainability tips for what you can 
do personally to support local sustainability initiatives are provided as follows. 
Volunteering is a way everyone can get involved and give back to the local com­
munity as well as promote social sustainability. Giving back is a great way to keep 
resources local while supporting fellow community members and local organiza­
tions. Communicate with your neighbors and community members about sustain­
ability and social issues. Identify the challenges and opportunities that you could 
address to make positive changes in your community.

Sustainable manufacturing involves developing sustainable products with total 
life-cycle considerations. It is the creation of manufactured products using nonpol­
luting, natural resources conservation practices, supported by economically sound 
and safe manufacturing processes, practices, and systems. Such manufacturing 
practices are safe and are economically sound while simultaneously being societally 
beneficial.

10.3  What Is Sustainable Manufacturing?

146
Sustainable manufacturing is causing companies to implement new design and 
analysis procedures, energy reduction methods, material reduction efforts, and 
improved materials handling practices. Reducing consumption of energy, raw mate­
rials, water, and other resources in a factory to leverage greater efficiency and pro­
ductivity is challenging and often starts with the basics of switching off lights and 
replacing the luminaires with LEDs. Fabric waste is turned into tiles and furniture.
Sustainable manufacturing has become the most important aspect to be consid­
ered by all manufacturing engineers otherwise known as production engineers, 
because it is an obligation to the world we live in. The three major principles sus­
tainability leaders, actors, and implementers should keep in mind are reducing the 
resource utilization, using environment-friendly materials, and reducing all forms 
of waste while advocating for the reuse and recycling of materials.
The manufacturing industry seeks indicators to measure the sustainability of 
manufactured products and manufacturing processes. The main tool commonly 
used to implement SM is the life cycle assessment (LCA). It is a method used in 
assessing environmental impacts associated with all the stages of a product’s life, 
from cradle to grave. It is an approach to examine fully the environmental impact of 
different activities performed by humans including the production of goods and 
services by corporations. LCA is mainly concerned with identifying the environ­
mental impact of a given product or process at each stage of their life.
10.4  Sustainable Approaches
The issue of sustainability is becoming more and more central to the industry. 
Manufacturers engaged in sustainability activities include those of all sizes, ages, 
and sectors. The reasons companies are pursuing sustainability goals and initiatives 
include [10]:
•	 Increase operational efficiency by reducing costs and waste.
•	 Respond to or reach new customers and increase competitive advantage.
•	 Protect and strengthen brand and reputation and build public trust.
•	 Build long-term business viability and success.
•	 Respond to regulatory constraints and opportunities.
Ways that companies progress further on the path to sustainability include [10]:
	1.	 Address sustainability in a coordinated, integrated, and formal manner, rather 
than in an ad hoc, unconnected, and informal manner.
	2.	 Focus on increased competitiveness and revenues rather than primarily focusing 
on cost-cutting, risk reduction, and improved efficiency.
	3.	 Use innovation, scenario planning, and strategic analysis to go beyond 
compliance.
	4.	 Integrate sustainability across business functions.
	5.	 Focus more on the long term.
10  Sustainable Manufacturing

147
	6.	 Work collaboratively with external stakeholders.
Companies can build sustainable manufacturing for the new normal. To practice 
sustainable manufacturing in your company requires the following steps [11]:
	1.	 Start practicing sustainable manufacturing with a plan.
	2.	 Keep the benefits at the forefront of your focus.
	3.	 Get certified in ISO standards that encourage environmental sustainability.
	4.	 Analyze your production process and see what can be eliminated.
	5.	 Encourage your entire company to be involved.
10.5  Sustainable Manufacturing Examples
Sustainable manufacturing is the creation of manufactured products using economi­
cally sound, nonpolluting processes which minimize negative environmental 
impacts while conserving energy and natural resources as well as increasing pro­
ductivity and efficiency. It is relevant in different sectors like business, economics, 
environment, and society. Some examples of sustainable manufacturing include 
[12–14]:
•	 Automotive Industry: The automotive industry is regarded as a major economic 
force worldwide. It has undergone substantial transformations, which have 
reduced fuel consumption, minimized environmental impact, and improved 
safety. Sustainable manufacturing in the automotive industry is becoming an 
imperative strategy to drive profitable growth and provide value to customers. As 
the automotive industry continues to embrace and make sustainability its strate­
gic imperative, it is important that automotive organizations reflect the newer 3P 
definition of sustainability: Pollution Prevention Pays [15]. In 2008, GM, a mul­
tinational corporation, approved three sustainability metrics: an energy use 
index, a water index, and a carbon emission index to calculate the company’s 
performance and targets. Ford strove to eliminate waste from production. BMW 
was rated the world’s most sustainable company in 2016.
•	 Construction Industry: The construction industry has its footprints on all human 
efforts to control, modify, and dominate nature and natural systems. There is a 
growing consensus that delivering a sustainable culture and environment starts 
with incorporating sustainability thoughts at the planning and design stages of an 
infrastructure construction project. Geotechnical engineering can significantly 
influence the sustainability of infrastructure development because of its early 
position in the construction process [16].
•	 Furniture Manufacturing: A furniture production company can integrate sustain­
ability concepts in order to make a positive impact on the environment, society, 
and its own financial success. The principles of lean and green manufacturing 
10.5  Sustainable Manufacturing Examples

148
can deliver a significant, positive impact on multiple measures of operational 
performance of furniture production [17].
•	 Pharmaceutical Manufacturing: This relies on resources such as energy and 
water that can be expensive and generate large amounts of waste both toxic and 
benign. A robust focus on corporate sustainability can benefit pharmaceutical 
manufacturers. A sustainability strategy that focuses on managing risks associ­
ated with water use, energy consumption, and waste can prevent FDA warning 
letters [18].
•	 Chemical Manufacturing: Chemical manufacturing produces a large amount of 
wastes and also carbon emissions that harm the environment. Any process that 
reduces carbon emissions improves the sustainability of operations. Fossil fuels 
can be replaced with renewable energy sources in chemical manufacturing to 
facilitate sustainable production of high-quality chemicals [19].
•	 Customized Manufacturing: The production of personalized products using sus­
tainable manufacturing systems and supply chains allows localized manufactur­
ing and therefore a shortening of supply chains becoming more energy and 
resource efficient. Reshoring the apparel manufacturing to allow for faster, more 
customizable fashion would redefine the interaction between the manufacturer 
and the consumer. It is expected that this shift to more localized manufacturing 
will primarily affect goods manufacturers [20].
•	 Remanufacturing: This involves the processing of used products for restoration 
to their original condition. Remanufacturing and product recovery attracts sig­
nificant attention due to environmental concerns, legislative requirements, con­
sumer interests in green products, and market image of manufacturers.
•	 Resource conservation: The pressing needs of energy, water, and other resource 
conservation worldwide is a major engineering challenge. The most recent data 
on water use in the United States reported manufacturers consumed approxi­
mately 21 billion gallons per day from both municipal and self-supplied sources. 
As drivers such as population growth and climate change increase pressure on 
freshwater resources, both at the local and global level, manufacturers are seek­
ing ways to incorporate more efficient and sustainable water use practices into 
their operations. This sustainable water use is driven from both an environmental 
perspective and a business perspective.
•	 Sustainable Logistics: Transportation is an important part of the manufacturing 
supply chains. There is a need for a sustainable means for shipping goods from 
origin A to destination B. Sustainable shipping works toward reducing transpor­
tation emissions footprint that can be harmful to the environment [21].
•	 Regulatory Compliance: A sustainability strategy that focuses on managing risks 
associated with water use, energy consumption, and waste can prevent FDA 
warning letters.

10.6  Benefits
Environmental responsibility has become an integral part of the way products are 
manufactured, marketed, and purchased. The benefits of sustainable manufacturing 
are almost infinite. An increasing number of manufacturers are realizing substantial 
benefits from sustainable business practices. Some forward-thinking organizations 
have added vice presidents of sustainability to their leadership teams. Designing 
products to be environmentally benign can contribute to their successful introduc­
tion and maintenance. Other benefits of sustainable manufacturing include the fol­
lowing [22, 23]:
•	 Increased Sales: Sustainable manufacturing will make your business more 
attractive and marketable. Sustainability should be particularly profitable for 
manufacturers.
•	 Energy Efficiency: Companies of all sizes are pursuing sustainability by improv­
ing efficiency and reducing their energy consumption. When manufacturing 
focuses on efficiency, energy use invariably decreases.
•	 Save Energy Costs: Replacing incandescent bulbs and fluorescent tubes with 
LED lighting can reduce electricity usage because LED lighting consumes a 
smaller amount of electricity. Converting to a renewable energy source, such as 
wind, geothermal, or solar, can stabilize energy cost with a much longer pay­
back period.
•	 Incentives: There are government incentives, tax credits, grants, and utility com­
pany rebates for businesses that support sustainable practices.
•	 Workplace Morale: Implementing green practices typically spurs collaboration 
and teamwork.
•	 Recycling of Waste: Implementing sustainable practices in manufacturing 
reduces water and energy usage, minimizes waste, and decreases hazardous 
emissions. Production waste is collected by the manufacturing company or by a 
specialized recycling company and returned for recycling.
•	 Environmental Health and Safety: Sustainable manufacturing enhances the 
safety of the products, employees, and community. Safety practices include 
developing and enforcing employee safety procedures. Such practices can return 
your investment by providing an accident-free workplace and demonstrating to 
your employees that their health and safety are important.
•	 Quality Improvement: Quality improvement programs offer your best employee-­
driven opportunities for enhanced teamwork while registering satisfied custom­
ers, sales growth, and efficient operation.
•	 Reduce costs, reduce waste, and increase operational efficiency.
•	 Increase competitive advantage.
•	 Enhance brand name recognition and reputation while simultaneously cultivat­
ing public trust and loyalty.
•	 Contribute to long-term business visibility, viability, and success.
•	 Comply with regulatory constraints.

10.7  Challenges
The major challenges faced by the manufacturing industry in its pursuit of sustain­
ability goals are as follows [24]:
	 1.	 The manufacturing industry is facing the challenge of measuring sustainability 
performance in a product’s life cycle. Developing metrics for sustainable 
­manufacturing is critical to enable manufacturing companies to quantitatively 
measure the sustainability performance in specific manufacturing processes.
10  Sustainable Manufacturing

151
	 2.	 Industry is unable to measure economic, social, and environmental impacts and 
costs of their products accurately during the entire life cycle and across their 
supply chain.
	 3.	 Full life cycle analysis or assessment (LCA) of products requires new methods 
to analyze, integrate, and aggregate information across hierarchical levels, 
organizational entities, and supply chain participants. Existing methods of 
aggregation do not take into account sustainability issues.
	 4.	 Cost is one of the main reasons manufacturers stay away from sustainable 
practices.
	 5.	 Industry lacks neutral and trusted standards and programs to demonstrate, 
deploy, and accredit new sustainable manufacturing practices, guidelines, and 
methods.
	 6.	 Regulations need to be supported and informed by industry standards. These 
regulations/standards should be harmonized.
	 7.	 Current manufacturing modeling and assessment criteria require intensive revi­
sions and upgrades to keep up with these new challenges.
	 8.	 The production and delivery of personalized goods and services using sustain­
able manufacturing systems and processes present a major challenge.
	 9.	 The word “sustainability” has been overused and abused.
	10.	 Consumer education is needed and in some cases critical, as some customers 
are not sure what packaging can and cannot be recycled.
	11.	 There are too many metrics; these can be condensed and grouped, predicated on 
consolidation and harmonization.
10.8  Global Adoption of Sustainable Manufacturing
With Goal 12 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals encouraging responsible 
production, sustainable practices have been gaining traction worldwide. An increas­
ing number of organizations are treating “sustainability” as an important part of 
their strategy to increase growth and global competitiveness. Manufacturers around 
the world are making the move toward adopting sustainability. We now consider 
how different nations are integrating sustainability into their manufacturing 
and design.

­
•	 United Kingdom: It has been recommended that food and drink manufacturers 
become key agents of change. In response to this, Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE) 
has released the final findings, entitled Sustainable Manufacturing for the Future. 
It has launched a £56 m operational investment plan, accelerating its journey 
toward sustainability in Great Britain. CCE shares its vision for sustainable man­
ufacturing, offering a picture of what the “factory of the future” may look like in 
Great Britain by 2050 [26].
•	 Canada: According to the government of Canada, sustainable manufacturing 
promotes minimizing or eliminating production and processing wastes through 
eco-efficient practices and encourages adopting new environmental technolo­
gies. Although the manufacturing sector (including primary metal, paper, chemi­
cal, and petroleum and coal) significantly contributes greatly to the Canadian 
economy, the sector has contributed to the inefficient utilization of energy and 
increased pollution, posing a threat to the environment. The Canadian govern­
ment is therefore encouraging manufacturing organizations to help fulfill its 
commitment to reduce the nation’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 20 per­
cent in the year 2020. Adopting sustainable manufacturing practices can help 
manufacturing companies reduce their GHG emissions, enhance their brand 
image, gain a competitive edge, and build trust among the investors, regulators, 
and customers [27].
10  Sustainable Manufacturing

153
•	 China: Chinese manufacturing industry is in a transitional period. Although 
China is making great developments industrially, there is still a lot of ground to 
cover. China has launched the Made in China 2025 initiative to bring the Chinese 
economy to the cutting edge and create a sustainable manufacturing base. By 
employing AI, China is modernizing their manufacturing and economy. China is 
also investing in the development of sustainable manufacturing. It will become 
one of the fastest growing sustainable manufacturing sectors [28].
•	 Norway: Norwegian society is dependent on sustainable value creation. 
Manufacturing products and services based on the natural factors of our environ­
ment should be given priority. A reindustrialization process is also needed so that 
manufacturing previously outsourced to low-cost countries can return to Norway. 
The Government’s Industry White Paper of March 2017 highlights the need 
using new materials, digitizing processes, restructuring within sustainable limits, 
and emphasizing the importance of research and innovation. To attract Norwegian 
and international players to invest in Norway, it will be necessary to demonstrate 
that the activity is sustainable [29].
•	 India: A survey of 198 Indian SMEs have identified the following aspects of 
sustainable manufacturing: “The final quantitative benefits of green manufactur­
ing in order of their decreased ranking are improved morale, improved brand 
value, lowered regulatory concerns, increased market opportunities, improved 
product performance, and decreased liabilities. The government has earmarked 
funds for improving the current infrastructure. Several measures have been taken 
toward the sensitization on sustainable agricultural methods including optimum 
use of water and saving as much water as possible for irrigation [30].
10.9  Conclusion
Protecting our planet is becoming a priority for everyone. Today, there is a growing 
awareness of environmental stewardship and sustainability. Sustainability has 
become an increasingly important requirement for economic activities. It has been 
applied to many fields such as manufacturing, design, engineering, and environ­
mental stewardship. The implementation of sustainable systems is an essential 
requirement in modern manufacturing.
A growing number of manufacturers are treating “sustainability” as an important 
objective in their strategy and operations in order to increase growth and global 
competitiveness. Sustainable manufacturing, with promising environmental and 
social benefits, is the wave of the future for manufacturing. It needs to be integral to 
every aspect of a manufacturer’s operations. More information about sustainable 
manufacturing can be found in the books in [31–53] and the related journals:

Lean Manufacturing
11.1  Introduction
Due to global competition and the competitive awareness of customers, manufac­
turers all over the world are under pressure to reduce their production costs, elimi­
nate waste, increase productivity, and improve quality while remaining profitable. 
To survive in the prevailing global competition, a manufacturing company must 
eliminate production waste. One approach that is widely applied in eliminating 
waste is lean manufacturing. Lean manufacturing (LM) is all about reducing or 
eliminating waste in production in all its forms. It is “manufacturing without waste.” 
It is widely perceived by the industry as an answer to their requirement for waste 
reduction [1, 2].
Lean manufacturing (LM) is all about doing more with less by applying “lean 
thinking.” Lean thinking is believing that there is a simpler, better, easier way to 
complete our work. LM involves conscious, never-ending efforts to completely 
eliminate or reduce waste. Its goal is to satisfy the customer with the exact product, 
quality, and quantity delivered to the right location at the right time and price in the 
shortest amount of time.
Lean principles are derived from methodologies applied by the Japanese manu­
facturing industry in the 1990s. It is a systematic method that focuses on eliminating 
or reducing waste within manufacturing systems without sacrificing productivity. It 
is the application of lean practices, principles, and techniques to manufacture prod­
ucts as well as deliver services. It has become a popular concept in the developed 
world as well as in the developing world. It is expressed in the famous adage that 
says, “a penny saved is a penny earned.”
This chapter provides an introduction to lean manufacturing, its philosophy and 
applications. It begins by describing different types of waste. It explains what lean 
manufacturing is all about. It covers lean manufacturing principles. It mentions the 
relationship between lean manufacturing and other manufacturing concepts such as 
Lean manufacturing is at the core of our strategy to support our 
growth. You have to take waste out of everything. We only want 
to do things that our customers are willing to pay for.

nies are implementing lean manufacturing. It gives some applications of lean manu­
facturing. It highlights the benefits and challenges of lean manufacturing. It

•	 Overproduction Waste: This is producing more than the customer demands. 
There are two types of overproduction: (1) quantitative, making more products 
than needed, and (2) early, making products before needed.
•	 Inventory Waste: This involves keeping more than the minimum stock of raw 
materials, parts, and finished goods necessary. To prevent this, list only what 
you need.
•	 Waiting Waste: Spending time waiting is called spending for no reason. This 
includes waiting for material, labor, information, equipment, etc. It also includes

operators standing idle while machines or equipment fails. When big mistakes 
are made, resources are wasted.
•	 Defect Waste: This entails the time and effort spent correcting and inspecting 
rework and scrap. When something is not working properly, there is defect waste. 
Learn to identify common mistakes and make everyone aware of them so that the 
mistakes do not occur consistently.
•	 Transportation Waste: Excessive movements and handling can cause damages 
and can lead to quality deterioration. Transportation waste can be a catalyst for 
other wastes such as waiting.
•	 Motion Waste: If something is moved when it is not really necessary, that is 
regarded as motion waste. Any motion that an employee has to perform that does 
not add value to the product is considered waste.
•	 Overprocessing: This consists of steps that add no value to the product but cost 
the outlay of resources. It includes any activities performed on the products that 
are not required or expected by the customer. Overprocessing costs time, materi­
als, machinery, and money.
•	 Underutilized Talent. This refers to not utilizing people to their fullest potential 
including time, talent, skill, and even ideas. To make sure your workers are 
reaching their full potential, invest in quality training programs that build effi­
ciency within your teams.
The acronym TIIMWOOD can be used to remember the eight types of waste. It 
stands for: Transport, Idleness, Inventory, Motion, Waiting, Overproduction, 
Overprocessing, Defect. Thus, lean manufacturing is a generic process that aims at 
getting the right things to the right place, at the right time, and in the right quantity 
to achieve zero waiting time, zero inventory, reduced batch sizes, and reduced pro­
cess times.
11.3  Concept of Lean Manufacturing
Lean manufacturing (also known as lean production) is regarded as a methodology 
to improve productivity and decrease costs in manufacturing organizations. It 
addresses one of the worst things that can happen to any company: waste. It is 
regarded as a declared war against the waste of both manufacturing inefficiencies 
and the underutilization of people. It is also concerned with the company’s goals of 
improving quality, reducing inventory, and becoming more competitive. Lean can 
mean “less” in terms of less waste, less design time, less cost, fewer organizational 
layers, and fewer suppliers per customer. The major goal of lean manufacturing is 
total elimination of waste in human effort, inventory, and time. Other goals of lean 
manufacturing are to improve the quality of products, reduce production times, and 
reduce total costs [6].
Lean manufacturing is American name for the Toyota Production System which 
was introduced by Toyota in the 1990s for the minimization of waste and 
11.3  Concept of Lean Manufacturing

160
inefficiency in its manufacturing operations. Today, hundreds of manufacturing 
companies around the world embrace the principle of lean manufacturing to reduce 
waste and improve their overall operations and enhance their profitability. For an 
American manufacturing company, being lean manufacturing is crucial, for com­
peting with lower-cost countries. Lean aims to enhance productivity by simplifying 
the operational structure and the work environment [7].
To remain competitive, manufacturing organizations have to be in a constant 
mode of continuous improvement. Lean manufacturing continually focuses on 
management efforts to improve processes to reduce or eliminate any wastes (devia­
tions from standard) through employee involvement in continuous improvement of 
products, processes, and standards. As waste is eliminated, production time and cost 
are reduced, and organizational profits soar.
11.4  Lean Manufacturing Principles
Womack and Jones, in their book Lean Thinking: Banish Waste and Create Wealth 
in Your Corporation, provide the following five principles of lean manufactur­
ing [8–10].
•	 Value: The critical starting point for lean thinking is value. The value the cus­
tomer assigns to the product and services is what determines what the customer 
will pay. The manufacturer focuses on eliminating waste so that it can deliver the 
value the customer expects at the highest level of profitability.
•	 Value Stream: Once the value (end goal) is determined, the next step is mapping 
the “value stream.” This refers to the totality of the product’s entire life cycle 
from the raw materials to eventual disposal. All businesses must clarify the 
“value stream,” the nexus of actions to bring the product through problems solv­
ing, information management, and physical transformation tasks. Steps, materi­
als, features, and movements that do not add value are eliminated.
•	 Flow: After the waste has been eliminated from the value stream, the next step is 
to be sure that the remaining steps flow smoothly with no interruptions, delays, 
or bottlenecks. Flow traces the product across departments. Understanding flow 
is essential to the elimination of waste. The lean manufacturing principle of flow 
is about creating a value chain with no interruption in the production process.
•	 Pull: The lean principle of pull helps ensure flow by making sure that nothing is 
made ahead of time. The pull approach dictates that nothing is made until the 
customer orders it. This means that the customer can “pull” the product from the 
manufacturer as needed. This way products do not need to be built in advance 
and stored.
•	 Perfection: This involves making lean thinking and process improvement part of 
the corporate culture. Lean practitioners strive to achieve nothing short of perfec­
tion. The relentless pursuit of perfection is what drives users of the approach to 
dig deeper, measure more, and change more often than their competitors. Every

employee should be involved in implementing lean. A collective mindset for 
continuous and incremental improvement is essential to reach the company’s 
goal of perfection.

	1.	 Sort: The participants or employees sort through their tools and equipment, sep­
arate that which is needed, and transfer them to their designated storage locations.
	2.	 Straighten: Once the first step is complete, the employees can further improve 
efficiency by arranging the items in a way that promotes minimal motion, trans­
portation, and waiting time. Tools and other items should always be arranged 
skillfully in a way that employees can easily locate them.
	3.	 Shine: The aim of shine is to have a clean workplace to ensure that the workplace 
is free of dirt. It consists of cleaning and inspecting regularly using tools to keep 
them in good condition. Shining is cleaning regularly so other lean standards can 
be upheld and so defects are not missed.
	4.	 Standardize: The main objective of the standardization step is to provide stan­
dard operating procedures for 5S implementation. This could be a standard 
method of reviewing and assessing the 5S strategy.
11.4  Lean Manufacturing Principles

162
 
11
	5.	 Sustain: This ensures the sustainability of the 5S strategy by creating constant 
reminders for the workers to implement 5S in the best possible manner.
	6.	 Safety: Modern standards are adding safety as an additional S, creating a 6S 
strategy. Neglecting safety can cause loss of life, harm to the environment, and 
loss of reputation of the company.
It is worth mentioning that lean manufacturing is a Japanese method focused on 
3 Ms.: muda, the Japanese word for waste; mura, the Japanese word for inconsis­
tency; and muri, the Japanese word for unreasonableness.
11.5  Relationship of Lean and Other Concepts
Lean manufacturing is the optimal way of producing goods by minimizing waste.
It is a philosophy that is based on creating smooth flow, minimizing waste, and 
respect for the worker.
It may be expedient to take a moment to see the relationship between lean and 
other manufacturing concepts such as Six Sigma, green manufacturing, cellular 
manufacturing, and Industry 4.0.
•	 Six Sigma: This was founded by Motorola in late 1980s. Six Sigma is the most 
popular quality movements in the industry. Six Sigma is a method that relies on 
a collaborative team effort to improve performance, remove waste, and reduce 
variation. The 3 Cs in Six Sigma are (1) change, changing society; (2) customer, 
power is shifted to customer; and (3) competition, competition in quality and 
productivity. Lean Six Sigma is a synergized managerial concept that combines 
lean and Six Sigma. It has been recommended as the integration of lean and Six 
11  Lean Manufacturing

163
Sigma so that it becomes a much more powerful integrated tool. The process is 
used to eliminate defects in a process. It is a powerful tool to improve the effi­
ciency and effectiveness of a business [13, 14]. Some organizations have com­
bined the principles of lean manufacturing and Six Sigma into one program 
known as Lean Six Sigma.
•	 Green Manufacturing: This focuses on minimizing environmental impact of 
manufacturing processes and products. It refers to modern manufacturing that 
makes products without pollution. It addresses a wide range of environmental 
and sustainability issues including resource selection, transportation, manufac­
turing process, and pollution. Lean manufacturing includes several techniques to 
eliminate waste and improve the manufacturing system. Green manufacturing 
systems reduce waste just as lean manufacturing. Although not every lean prac­
tice is correlated with every environmental indicator, lean manufacturing is a 
good example of what is known as a sustainable competitive advantage.
•	 Cellular Manufacturing: This is a particular model for workplace design that is 
an important part of lean manufacturing. Successful implementation of manufac­
turing cells requires addressing product and/or process selection, design, opera­
tion, and control issue. The most important benefits of cellular manufacturing are 
achieved when manufacturing cells are designed, controlled, and operated using 
just-in-time (JIT) [15].
•	 Industry 4.0: This is the current gradual industrial transformation with automa­
tion, cloud computing, cyber-physical systems, robots, and industrial IoT to real­
ize smart industry and manufacturing. It is the new manufacturing objectives 
with the aim of achieving nearly zero-defects production in the manufacturing 
industry [9]. Lean systems have an entirely different focus. Lean may be regarded 
as a combined set of principles, practices, and techniques with an aim to improve 
quality, cost, and customer satisfaction by eliminating three main sources of loss: 
variability, waste, and inflexibility [16].
11.6  Why Are Companies Using Lean Manufacturing?
Some typical reasons companies are using lean manufacturing are provided as 
follows.
•	 “Lean thinking” was adopted by the automobile industry business processes and 
operations.
•	 Lean principles help workers in the food industry to make improvements in 
performance.
•	 In plastic bags industry, lean manufacturing has caused higher productivity and 
identified the major types/sources of waste.
•	 Lean manufacturing principles have been implemented in a cement industry, 
which is a process industry, different from discrete manufacturing.
11.6  Why Are Companies Using Lean Manufacturing?

164
•	 Implementing lean in printing companies may dramatically enhance perfor­
mance, save time, improve quality, lower costs, reduce inventory, and lead times.
•	 Lean principles can be applied in meal production and can result in increased 
production efficiency and systematic improvement of product quality.
•	 Application of lean manufacturing principle enabled Intel to meet a 46% increase 
in the number of training collateral with a 36% reduction in training resources.
•	 Lean is useful in hospitals and has made possible, limited impact on the overall 
healthcare performance.
11.7  Applications
11.4
17
­
•	 Automotive Industry: Lean manufacturing has revolutionized manufacturing 
starting in the automotive industry. The lean manufacturing concept was first 
coined in The International Motor Vehicle Program, attended by automotive 
 
17
11  Lean Manufacturing

165
manufacturers in North America, Japan, and Europe. The lean manufacturing 
was launched as a concept describing best practice within the automotive indus­
try but has gradually evolved to other industries [18, 19].
•	 Plastic Industry: Lean manufacturing is concerned with the implementation of 
several tools and methodologies that aim for the continuous elimination of wastes 
throughout the manufacturing process. It focuses on the company’s goals of 
improving quality, reducing inventory, and becoming more competitive. Lean 
manufacturing has been implemented in the plastic bag industry. It has achieved 
lower process cycle time, lower manufacturing lead time, and higher productiv­
ity [20].
•	 Machine Tool Industry: This industry often requires quick delivery since machine 
tool companies are selling their products to all types of industries. These compa­
nies need machine tools as soon as possible to deliver their product. If a job shop 
receives some business that requires machine tools, then the customer will imme­
diately need to acquire that specific machine, and quick delivery is very impor­
tant. Manufacturers, such as Mazak Corporation in Florence, KY, are facing a 
difficult economic environment, as machine-tool technology supplier. Mazak has 
used lean manufacturing principles to develop a new production system called 
“modular assembly” in 2002 [21, 22].
•	 Printing Industry: The newspaper industry is facing several challenges, and its 
development is continuously changing. It is crucial for newspapers to analyze the 
trends in order to survive in the challenging market. The industry was still profit­
able by the end of 2008, but the recession has threatened the survival of newspa­
pers. Implementing lean in printing companies is an excellent starting point in 
identifying and removing bottlenecks and constraints. It may dramatically 
enhance performance, save time, improve quality, lower costs, and reduce inven­
tory [23].
•	 Sewing Industry: The sewing industry is an essential component of the textile 
industry. Sewing requires using sewing machines to assemble fabric pieces and 
attach various accessories like elastics, buttons, and labels. Sewing is considered 
a labor-intensive industry. Widespread implementation of lean manufacturing is 
considered recent to textile companies. However, lean manufacturing implemen­
tation in the sewing industry is challenging. To implement lean manufacturing 
tools in the sewing process, process measures must be defined, and the cost of 
processing must be quantified [24].
•	 Lean Management: This is a common application of lean principles. It encour­
ages shared responsibility and shared leadership. The main objective of lean 
management is creating value to the customer by optimizing resources. The two 
main pillars of the lean methodology are respect for people and continuous 
improvements, ensuring that every employee is involved in the process of 
improving [25].
•	 Quality: Quality is very important in manufacturing. Customer demands for 
high-quality goods. Quality in manufacturing is more related to process control. 
11.7  Applications

166
The risk of product-liability litigation against businesses has compelled compa­
nies to seek ways to sustain quality assurance in their products and services. With 
the rapid increase in the number of new product introductions, quality may be 
compromised. To stay competitive, companies must meet customers’ changing 
wants and needs. Some companies are already ingraining quality into every step 
of their production process. The goal of lean manufacturing is producing quality 
products, reducing waste, and maximizing material flow. Lean manufacturing is 
one way to improve the quality of a product and service. Quality assurance may 
be regarded as assuring product quality in order to increase the customer’s satis­
faction and to reduce the total cost.
•	 Product Safety: This is a basic requirement from customers. Manufacturers pay 
substantial efforts to predict potential safety hazards on the prototypes so as to 
improve the product safety in new product development. Lean manufacturing 
can assist manufacturer to enhance the potential product safety issues in prede­
sign and post-design stages of product development processes [26].
•	 Hospital: Lean is often applied in hospitals, but the impact tends to be limited. 
Lean tends to be applied in secondary and support functions with a logistic char­
acter and therefore has had a limited impact on the overall healthcare perfor­
mance. Lean is useful for hospitals, but the lean concept as well as the 
implementation of lean in hospitals has often been described as a straightforward 
process. Lean provides opportunities for making significant improvements 
within all areas of a hospital [27].
Other lean manufacturing applications include aerospace, textile industry, food 
industry, material handling, and construction. Each of these applications may pres­
ent its own challenges. The success of implementation of any particular application 
largely depends upon organizational characteristics. Lean manufacturing is a multi­
dimensional approach, and not all organizations should implement the same set of 
practices [28].
11.8  Benefits
Lessons learned from lean principles can be universally applied to any business. The 
benefits of lean principles are evident in many factories worldwide. Every company 
has a tremendous opportunity to improve, using lean principles. First-pass correct 
output, reduced manufacturing lead time, and increased productivity are the three 
main drivers of lean implementation. The operational metrics for LM are on target 
and business-centric on all accounts: high productivity, reduced lead time, improved 
first-pass correct output, reduced inventory, and space requirement [29]. Other ben­
efits include [30, 31]:
11  Lean Manufacturing

167
•	 Reduce Waste: Waste is bad for costs and resources. The lean manufacturing 
process helps companies reduce or eliminate the excess waste produced during 
production. Lean provides a way to do more and more with less and less. By 
focusing on eliminating waste, a company can reduce its negative impact on the 
global environment.
•	 Reduce Costs: Money is saved when a company is not wasting time, resources, 
and personnel on unnecessary activities. Overproduction adds to the cost for 
storage.
•	 Reduce Time: Time is money, as the adage goes, and wasting time is therefore 
wasting money. Reducing the time it takes to start and finish a project improves 
efficiencies. The less time that is required to complete a task, the leaner the 
workforce.
•	 Safer Working Environment: Safety and ergonomics are incorporated in lean 
manufacturing. Less inventory means less clutter, which means less accidents 
and better visibility. It also means a lesser chaotic environment and more 
free space.
•	 Improve Employee Morale: Constant feedback from employees includes and 
empowers them in the decision-making process. This boosts employee morale. 
Efforts toward less wasteful production can also make your employees’ work 
more productive and improve employee morale.
•	 Improve Quality: Lean manufacturing utilizes fewer resources and produces 
high levels of product quality and service. Since there is less focus on excessive 
production, there is more of an opportunity to focus on quality.
•	 Better Customer Service: By reducing various types of waste in your company, 
you can get products to your customers, faster, and meet their needs more easily.
•	 Better for the Environment: One of the biggest threats to our environment today 
is the excessive waste. Lean manufacturing is an approach that has been most 
adaptable to its environment. It can be applied without negative effects on the 
working environment.
•	 Competitiveness: When properly applied, lean can create huge improvements in 
efficiency, cycle time, and productivity. Today, many organizations adopt lean 
manufacturing strategy that would help them compete in the competitive global­
ization market.
•	 Customer Satisfaction: Lean manufacturing proposes a customer-value focus to 
achieve the high efficiency. Lean involves only producing a product when the 
customer wants it. So a company needs to know their customers and identify 
their greatest need. Since lean implies adding value to processes and services, 
value means any useful activities for which the customer is willing to pay.
•	 Workplace Efficiency: Lean manufacturing improves workplace efficiency. 
Inventory and employee’s skills are used more efficiently. It is recognized as one 
of the most efficient and effective global operation strategies.

11.9  Challenges
Only a few companies can assess the impact of lean manufacturing at an early stage 
in order to determine its viability and profitability. Lean manufacturing can suffer if 
management decides to implement it without first consulting with its employees. 
There is lack of standard LM implementation process/framework. LM practices are 
regarded as advanced manufacturing practices and more than 50% of lean manufac­
turing implementation efforts fail. The major issues that make lean implementations 
a challenging task include time constraint, constraints of product quality, and com­
plexity of the manufacturing. A rush to become lean without adequate understand­
ing has resulted in several misapplications of lean manufacturing tools [32, 33]. 
Other challenges include the following:
•	 Lack of Commitment: Lean is perceived negatively, and organizations fail to ded­
icate time, manpower, and other resources toward lean. Implementing lean man­
ufacturing causes a profound cultural change that will alter the role of every 
person in entire organization. There is a lack of commitment from senior and 
middle management and poor understanding of lean manufacturing concepts.
11  Lean Manufacturing

169
•	 Lack of Change Management: The success of lean manufacturing requires con­
sistent and conscious efforts from the entire organization. Implementing lean 
requires everyone to be on board. Lack of support from senior management will 
cause lean implementations to fail.
•	 Lack of Teaching Materials: Successful implementation of lean principles 
requires that managers and employees be well-informed and educated in the 
application of lean tools. However, there is a shortage of lean teaching materials 
available to both corporate and academic educators.
•	 Bad Name: Lean has gotten a bad name since its inception in the 1990s. It has 
become a euphemism: “We cut jobs 10% to lean our organization.” That view is 
antithetical to lean thinking, which relies on creating trust for the long-term rela­
tionships needed to transform an organization. “There is a danger that companies 
associate lean with quick wins and lose the long-term benefits.”
•	 Standardization: Standardization creates the conditions necessary for controlled 
scientific inquiry. Demanding standardization in all aspects of production makes 
it easy for workers and managers to immediately identify problems.
11.10  Global Adoption of Lean Manufacturing
Lean manufacturing basically aims at eliminating any waste in all production phases 
in order to ensure their survival, obtain high productivity, excellent product quality, 
and reduced manufacturing costs. Many companies around the world are drawn to 
the idea of lean manufacturing. Lean manufacturing principles have been recog­
nized as one of the most efficient global operation strategies. They have emerged as 
a powerful approach that has been used by companies in developing countries to 
improve their operations. Developing countries such as India, Kuwait, Malaysia, 
Turkey, Brazil, Thailand, Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Indonesia have adopted the 
philosophy to reduce manufacturing costs. We now consider how lean manufactur­
ing is implemented in different nations.

These principles have been widely regarded as the system that made Toyota as 
successful as it is today [34].
•	 United States: An increasing number of US companies are outsourcing manufac­
turing operations to foreign countries with cheaper labor markets. The issues of 
keeping manufacturing jobs in America and increasing the competitiveness of 
the US manufacturing industry have become critical to the long-term sustainable 
prosperity of the US economy. Lean manufacturing has proven to be an effective 
strategy to increase productivity and cost competitiveness [37]. Henry Ford is 
commonly referenced as the true starting point of lean, and the Ford Production 
System paved the way for most modern lean manufacturing and is one of the best 
examples of lean manufacturing principles.
11  Lean Manufacturing

171
•	 United Kingdom: UK companies have been enthusiastic in employing lean prin­
ciples. The lean approach to business is focused on delivering customer value 
using the least resource. Many production processes have applied the lean strat­
egy with waste removed to bring efficiency gains [38]. For example, Oxford 
Engineering introduced lean principles throughout its operation, including its 
administrative functions. As a result, the company delivered a 16% increase in 
productivity.
•	 India: The traditional manufacturing industry has changed rapidly in developing 
nations like China or India in search of cheap labor and more profit. There are so 
many companies now producing goods in China and India that simply relying on 
their low-cost labor. India is entering the global market and emerging as the new 
destination for global manufacturing. India is the place to be for design, develop­
ment, and manufacturing of innovative products and major companies from 
Europe, the United States, and Japan [29].
•	 Zimbabwe: The manufacturing sector in Zimbabwe has been struggling in their 
operations due to inadequate funding to improve on its machinery and technol­
ogy. This has forced manufacturing companies in Zimbabwe to implement lean 
manufacturing in order to eliminate waste and improve the product quality. The 
main strength of lean manufacturing implementation in Zimbabwe is that the 
employees got motivated about the program which made them to be dedicated 
and hardworking. Its main weakness is that the implementation created fear 
among the workers for job losses through retrenchment [39].
11.11  Conclusion
Simply stated, lean manufacturing or “going lean” is a philosophy based on a stra­
tegic approach of continuous improvement through the elimination of waste and 
inefficiencies. It is a systematic approach to identifying the value-adding activities 
and then eliminate the non-value-adding activities. It involves using several tech­
niques to remove or reduce waste from production. It is the latest, most well-known, 
and most successful methodology being used by companies to turn their business 
around. It deserves the full attention of both employers and employees, because its 
objectives are to improve productivity, reduce waste, increase competitiveness, and 
optimize available resources. Companies, academic institutions, and governments 
are pushing their own version of lean as the strategy to manufacturing, educational, 
governmental salvation. Lean has now become a business system or culture.
There is a shortage of lean teaching materials available to both corporate and 
academic trainers. Some institutions have started integrating lean manufacturing 
into their traditional manufacturing engineering programs, and they are preparing 
students to better understand and practice lean manufacturing [33]. More informa­
tion about lean manufacturing can be found in the books in [36, 40–51].

Distributed Manufacturing
12.1  Introduction
Distributed manufacturing (DM) refers to the decentralized fabrication of parts in 
smaller factories or homes that are local to end users. It makes it possible for more 
innovators to reach the market with their products, while manufacturing is the pro­
cess by which materials are transformed into usable products.
Distributed manufacturing contributes to the inputs needed by other industries by 
providing products ranging from heavy-duty machinery to home electronics. The 
traditional manufacturing industry has focused mainly on mass production models 
to raise productivity. It has been characterized by the progressive centralization of 
operations that focus on benefits from economies of scale. It is responsible of a large 
share of the global environmental impacts as it releases significant amounts of emis­
sions and waste [1]. It works well for large organizations, but it is not as friendly to 
small businesses with few products on the market. It requires an expensive and 
time-consuming effort to develop and maintain. New architectures are needed for a 
new manufacturing paradigm to meet these challenges. These architectures must be 
agile, reliable, configurable, and adaptable [2].
Leveraging the advantages of Industry 4.0 and its related technologies such as 
cloud computing, the Internet of Things, and 3D printing has made distributed man­
ufacturing fascinating. This manufacturing-as-a-service model is achieved by mak­
ing small orders and prototyping affordable and building their production facilities 
near the places of consumption; consequently, today’s new manufacturing paradigm 
is more distributed than ever [3].
A potato can grow quite easily on a very small plot of land. 
With molecular manufacturing, we'll be able to have distributed 
manufacturing, which will permit manufacturing at the site 
using technologies that are low-cost and easily available.

This chapter provides a further introduction to distributed manufacturing. It 
begins by explaining the concept of distributed manufacturing. It describes distrib­
uted manufacturing systems and the features of distributed manufacturing. It covers 
some applications of DM. It highlights the benefits and challenges of DM. It 
addresses the global adoption of DM. The last section concludes with comments.
12.2  Concept of Distributed Manufacturing
Distributed manufacturing (DM) is all about creating products as close as possible 
to the customers who will use them. In traditional manufacturing, raw materials are 
often assembled and fabricated in large, centralized factories, and the finished prod­
ucts are then distributed to the customer. A manufacturer will own dedicated facto­
ries to create a convenient supply chain for their clients. Distributed manufacturing 
turns this approach around. In distributed manufacturing (DM), the raw materials 
and fabrication techniques are decentralized so that the final product is fabricated 
very close to the final customer. In contrast to mass manufacturing, distributed man­
ufacturing entails fabricating products in many locations around the world, close to 
where they are needed. Distributed manufacturing is a form of decentralized manu­
facturing which disrupts the scale economics of traditional manufacturing.
In today’s globalized world economy and the rapid development of information 
and communication technologies (ICT, i.e., the infrastructure and components that 
enable modern computing), the manufacturing resources of an enterprise are usu­
ally distributed geographically. Distributed manufacturing involves a complete 
rethinking of what it means to be a manufacturer. Raw materials remain decentral­
ized, while final assembly occurs on a much more individualized basis, close to the 
customer. In other words, components may be manufactured in different physical 
locations and then are brought together for assembly of the final product, near point 
of use locations. It means making parts all over the world and using supply chain 
management concepts to bring it all together for final production near the point of 
sale or use jurisdictions.
12.3  Distributed Manufacturing Systems
Distributed manufacturing systems (DMS) represent an ideal approach to meeting 
challenges regarding the individualization of products, predicated on customer 
proximity, or more sustainable production. They may be regarded as a class of man­
ufacturing systems, focused on internal manufacturing control and characterized by 
such common properties as autonomy, flexibility, adaptability, agility, and 
decentralization.

12.4  Features of Distributed Manufacturing
Distributed manufacturing is geographically distributing manufacturing facilities so 
that companies can get competitive advantages regarding costs, time, and quality. 
Distributed manufacturing has the following features [5].
•	 Localization: Manufacturing companies have realized that market and customer 
proximity have become an important factor for success on the market. Distributed 
manufacturing enables the local production of goods. Producing locally, close to 
the consumer, eliminates transportation costs, taxes, and tariffs. It also reduces 
emissions and negative environmental impacts. Adopting the distributed manu­
facturing system makes moral sense to the local community.
•	 Customization: A major characteristic of DM is the ability to produce custom­
ized products. DM can produce products that are individually tailored to very 
small markets. Customization and enhanced customer satisfaction is the answer 
to an increasing individualization of customer request.
•	 Personalization: In today’s competitive global market, customers demand per­
sonalized products. Distributed manufacturing has advantages over traditional 
manufacturing in that it can produce personalized product offerings which 
enhances customer loyalty and invites repeat business opportunities. Consumers 
can submit their own personalize products and are more involved in the design 
and fabrication of products.
12.4  Features of Distributed Manufacturing

178
•	 Product Longevity: Distributed production can increase product longevity 
through proximate repair centers and enhanced repair speeds. With 3D printing, 
spare parts can be easily made with lower customization costs.
•	 Easy Prototyping: With distributed manufacturing, device and PCB prototyping 
should be quick, reasonably priced, and painless.
•	 Low Inventory: Distributed manufacturing aims at keeping inventories low in 
favor of just-in-time production.
•	 Efficient Use of Resources: Distributed manufacturing is expected to enable a 
more efficient use of resources, with less wasted capacity in centralized factories. 
It should reduce the overall negative environmental impact of manufacturing.
12.5  Applications of Distributed Manufacturing
­
12.1 6
•	 On-Shore Manufacturing: Offshore manufacturing presents serious challenges, 
such as language barriers, time zones, enhanced opportunities for compromised 
quality and reliability, and many layers of sales and logistics. In the past, the only 
way to get electronics product manufacturing accomplished at a reasonable price 
is to do it offshore. With the rise of distributed manufacturing, there are now 
many options in the United States for cost-effective, reliable, and fast production 
and delivery realizations. On-shore manufacturing saves organizations the added 
complexity and risk associated with overseas operations.
•	 Furniture Industry: A company like AtFAB, a US maker of wood furniture, uses 
distributed manufacturing to meet customer demands. It replaces the aggregation 
of wood materials in a single factory with the distribution of computerized 
numerical control files to localized manufacturing sites. Parts are then assembled 
by the consumer or by local fabrication workshops that can turn them into fin­
ished products.
•	 Sustainable Construction: In recent years, there has been a shift toward more 
sustainable approaches for construction. Lean construction is regarded as one of 
the foundational viewpoints for the consideration of environmental factors within 
construction. Minimization of waste is of prime consideration in lean construc­
tion. In terms of construction, lean principles focus on the industry-wide reduc­
tion of waste. Sustainable construction seeks to reduce the environmental 
footprints of building sites. Sustainable modular construction can be viewed in 
terms of the distributed manufacturing paradigm [7].
•	 Desktop Factories: These are the new form of distributed manufacturing system, 
emerging through the recent progress in additive manufacturing (or 3D-­printing). 
12  Distributed Manufacturing

179
They play significant roles in supporting the on-demand manufacturing of cus­
tomized products. Such small-scale production systems show an ideal approach 
for DIY (do-it-yourself) manufacturing [8].
•	 Product-Service System (PSS): This concept is regarded as a promising type of 
business models to improve production and consumption toward social, eco­
nomic, and environmental sustainability. It is an integrated offering of products 
and services that fulfill specific customer demand. Distributed manufacturing, a 
network of small-scale production units equipped with advanced manufacturing 
technologies that are proximate to the point of sale and use, can be applied to 
PSS to address its implementation barriers such as organizational, financial, 
technical, social, cultural, and regulatory barriers [9].
12.6  Benefits
If managed properly, distributed manufacturing can offer significant benefits, 
including
reduced manufacturing costs, short time-to-market, increased supply-chain flex­
ibility, increased product safety, quality, reliability, and efficient use of resources. It 
allows technology designers and implementers to choose from a variety of machines, 
materials, and quantities with unparalleled flexibility, quality, cost-effectiveness, 
reliability, production on demand, and speed. Some manufacturers believe they 
have a lot to gain by distributing their products directly to the point of consumption 
and bypassing their intermediaries. Manufacturers can support multiple smaller 
economies by distributing their factories. Other benefits include [10]:
•	 Efficient Use of Resources: Distributed manufacturing will enable a more effi­
cient use of resources, with less wasted capacity in centralized factories. It should 
reduce the overall negative environmental impact of manufacturing. It is capable 
of delivering superior results in five (5) key ways: speed, quality, reliability, 
safety, and cost-effectiveness.
•	 Localization: Implementing DM-oriented techniques will achieve digitalization, 
personalization, and localization. Distributed manufacturing enables the local 
production of goods. Producing locally, close to the consumer, eliminates trans­
portation costs, taxes, and tariffs. By manufacturing products closer to their end 
destination, we reduce time to the market, logistics costs, environmental costs, 
and associated impacts.
•	 Friendly to Small Business: Small businesses with few products on the market do 
not always have the demand required to sustain or support traditional manufac­
turing. DM is friendly to small businesses or newly developed products by mak­
ing both small orders and rapid-prototyping affordable. Employing DM can lead 
to faster growth.
•	 Reduced Costs: Many of the capabilities of distributed manufacturing led to 
reduced costs. This is a key motivation for small businesses that are introducing 
products to market on a tight budget. DM also requires significantly less up-front 
12.6  Benefits

180
capital than traditional manufacturing. Logistical costs and environmental 
impacts are minimized when products are made geographically closer to their 
end user destinations.
•	 Faster Time-to-Market: By deploying the whole manufacturing process with 
user-friendly online tools and rapid prototyping, distributed manufacturing helps 
an enterprise get products into the hands of buyers more quickly and reduce 
transit time with fewer logistical challenges.
•	 Superior Quality: High-volume manufacturers often lose quality, while distrib­
uted manufacturing enables small shops to produce consistent and high-quality 
work and resulting products.
•	 Customer Relationships: Distributed manufacturing requires a different approach 
to maintaining relationships with customers. You are not flooding the market 
with large quantities of products but are producing demand-tailored goods that 
are closer to the market.
12.7  Challenges
­
11 12
12.2
12.3
•	 Workforce: Workers will no longer be centralized in large facilities. Instead, they 
will operate at smaller, distributed sites. They will rely increasingly on electronic 
files and mobile apps. Also, they will require entirely new skill sets. That means 
recruiting, training, and retaining a very different workforce.
•	 Complexity: Due to the complexity of products created in distributed manufac­
turing, collaboration and coordination are required among several facilities typi­
cally operating in different time zones. There is also the complexity of producing 
identical parts in separate facilities around the globe and with different standards 
and regulatory requirements.
•	 Security: This must be paramount to protect the intellectual property rights of the 
organization in all distributed transactions.
12.8  Global Adoption of Distributed Manufacturing
The primary benefit for adopting distributed manufacturing is the ability to create 
value at geographically dispersed locations. DM allows organizations in cities and 
small towns affected by globalization and outsourced manufacturing to produce 
12  Distributed Manufacturing

181

parts with less capital and overhead than ever before. Startups and established orga­
nizations around the world are now exploring the opportunities that distributed 
manufacturing presents. We now consider the adoption of distributed manufacturing 
in some nations [13].
•	 United States: For continued growth, US manufacturers must continually disrupt 
themselves and keep a mindset of innovation. Most factories in the United States 
operate at far less than capacity. Nike, for instance, is already localizing its man­
ufacture to optimize resource use by reducing the amount of land needed for 
large factories and saving on fuel and logistics for transportation. Nike could be

•	 China: China has made tremendous strides since opening its economy 30 years 
ago. China has been undergoing a transformation, moving from being the world’s 
manufacturing base to becoming a more integrated economy with a wider variety 
of value-added capabilities. The shift from being a manufacturing and export-­
oriented economy to a more integrated one is well recognized by policymakers 
in China. These changes are occurring because China’s cost-based advantages 
are being eroded through economic growth. The consequence has slowed down 
economic growth in China. Even with this slowdown, many analysts and 
­policymakers still see China as a strong market for domestic and foreign invest­
ment. The drop-off has been attributed by some to a lack of confidence in the 
short-­term in China’s economy. The base population of 1.3 billion people and the 
huge market continue to make China the most promising market among all the 
world’s emerging economies. At the national level, according to President Hu

production centers to the heart of the city. The plan is to open fab labs in every 
district of the city, and eventually every neighborhood, to enable local production 
of almost any kind of goods. The fab labs are also planned to be community 
problem-solving centers that assist in local energy and food production.

183
12.9  Conclusion
Manufacturing is becoming more complex and distributed than ever. Distributed 
manufacturing represents a radically different model of consumer goods produc­
tion, purchase, and use. Many companies have recently changed their manufactur­
ing system from traditional single factory to multi-factory to increase their 
international competitiveness. Using this approach, factories processing various 
machines and tools at different geographical locations are often combined [14, 15].
Distributed manufacturing is regarded as one of the leading emerging technolo­
gies for the future. It is the future of how products are fabricated and delivered to 
customers who use them. Interest in distributed manufacturing is progressively 
growing as it incorporates new technological advancements such as the Internet of 
Things (IoT), cloud computing, cloud manufacturing, semantic web, and virtualiza­
tion [16]. The idea of distributed manufacturing by geographically distributed pro­
duction will continue to play an important role. More information about distributed 
manufacturing can be found in the books in [17–20].

Cloud Manufacturing
13.1  Introduction
The manufacturing industry is crucial to the economy of any nation. Manufacturing 
is a vital sector in our society. It has always been a pillar industry of developed 
economies. It has been a strong impetus to the process of industrialization and mod­
ernization. Today’s manufacturing sector includes a wide range of industries, from 
food to automobile and aerospace and from computer to electronic product manu­
facturing [1].
Modern manufacturing has changed significantly due to intense global competi­
tion and remarkable advances in information technology. To survive in an increas­
ing competitive pressure, globalization, and rapid technology development, modern 
manufacturing requires a flexible and dynamic provisioning and management, using 
manufacturing resources available on demand over computer networks. Technology 
has always been the main driver of the transformation of manufacturing. Information 
technology is transforming the manufacturing industry by digitizing virtually every 
facet of modern manufacturing processes. Today, manufacturing is shifting from 
production-oriented manufacturing to service-oriented manufacturing [2]. Modern 
manufacturing system and processes are becoming increasingly complex, requiring 
users to use advanced tools such as cloud computing.
Cloud manufacturing (CM) (also known as Manufacturing-as-a-Service (MaaS) 
is newly emerging as a new promising manufacturing paradigm developed from 
existing advanced manufacturing models. It is a recent approach of adopting well-­
known basic concepts from cloud computing to manufacturing processes and 
deliver-shared, ubiquitous, on-demand manufacturing services. It refers to a 
customer-­centric approach for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand net­
work access to a shared pool of manufacturing resources and capabilities that can be 
rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort. CM transforms 
The cloud services companies of all sizes…The cloud is for 
everyone. The cloud is a democracy.

manufacturing resources and abilities into a cheap and on-demand virtualized ser­
vice pool (manufacturing cloud) for the whole life cycle of a product (e.g., design, 
simulation, production, test, verification, redesign, reuse, maintenance). In a CM 
system, manufacturing resources can be connected into the Internet and managed 
using the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies such RFID, wired and wireless sen­
sor network, and embedded devices [3].
This chapter provides an introduction to cloud manufacturing. It begins by pro­
viding an overview of cloud computing. It explains cloud manufacturing. It describes 
some of the applications of cloud manufacturing. It highlights the benefits and chal­
lenges of CM. It covers global cloud manufacturing and the future of cloud manu­
facturing. The last section concludes with comments.
13.2  Overview of Cloud Computing
“Cloud” is a metaphor for the Internet. Cloud computing (CC) represents the under­
lying platform technology enabling cloud manufacturing. It is a newly emerging 
service-oriented computing technology. It is the provision of scalable computing 
resources as a service over the Internet. It is a smart network manufacturing model 
that enables service-oriented personalized manufacturing. It allows manufacturers 
to use many forms of new production systems such as 3D printing, high-­performance 
computing (HPC), industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and industrial robots. It is 
transforming virtually every facet of modern manufacturing [4].
Cloud computing has been viewed as an innovation in computing whose key 
feature is the virtualization of computing resources and services. All kinds of manu­
facturing resources (including machines, processing centers, and computing equip­
ment) and capacities will be virtualized, unified, and centralized for management 
and operation, to achieve an intelligent multi-win-win situation. This extensive net­
worked environment of resources will provide high added value, low-cost products, 
and global manufacturing services [5].
Cloud computing provides shared computer resources and data to users through 
the Internet. It enables ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to share 
pool of computing resources such as networks, servers, storages, and services. It 
aims at making computing a utility such as water, gas, electricity, and telephone 
services. Computation, which used to be confined to one location, is now central­
ized in vast shared facilities [6].

•	 SaaS: This is a software delivery model in which software and associated data 
are hosted on the cloud. In this model, cloud service providers offer on-demand 
access to computing resources such as virtual machines and cloud storage. This

is also known as “software on demand.” For example, a cloud-based enterprise 
resource planning (ERP) for manufacturing is a type of SaaS used in the industry.
•	 PaaS: The platform is provided as a service. This allows the end user to create a 
software solution using tools or libraries from the platform service provider. In 
this model, cloud service providers deliver computing platforms such as pro­
gramming and execution.
•	 IaaS: This provides infrastructure hardware resources (such as computers, stor­
age, servers, etc.) as a service and allows users to customize their own IT infra­
structure dynamically.
Just like cloud computing, CM services can be categorized into four major 
deployment models (public, private, community, and hybrid clouds) [9, 10]:
•	 Private cloud refers to a centralized management effort in which manufacturing 
services are shared within one company or its subsidiaries. A private cloud is 
often used exclusively by one organization, possibly with multiple business units.
•	 Community cloud is a collaborative effort in which manufacturing services are 
shared between several organizations. Services are provided to multiple organi­
zations from a certain community with similar business goals.
•	 Public cloud realizes the key concept of sharing services with the general public. 
Public clouds are commonly implemented through data centers operated by pro­
viders such as Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft.
13.2  Overview of Cloud Computing

188
•	 Hybrid cloud essentially spans multiple configurations and is composed of two 
or more clouds (private, community, or public), offering the benefits of multiple 
deployment modes.
Cloud computing has proven to be a disruptive technology. It is becoming perva­
sive and omnipresent in our daily lives. It is changing the way industries do their 
businesses. It is emerging as one of the major enablers for the manufacturing indus­
try. It has inspired cloud manufacturing [7].
13.3  Cloud Manufacturing
The concept of cloud manufacturing was first proposed in 2009 by Bo Li and Lin 
Zhang in China and then supported by the Chinese Ministry of Science and 
Technology in 2010.
The term “cloud” means that your software, data, and related infrastructure are 
hosted via the Internet. State-of-the-art technologies that enable CM include cloud 
computing, pay-as-you-go/use utility computing, virtualization, social media, 
Internet of Things (IoT), RFID, wireless sensor network, embedded system, big 
data, wearable technologies, and service-oriented architecture (SOA). Because IoT 
is known for ubiquitous computing (using embedded sensors and actuators) and 
pervasive sensing technologies (such as RFID tags), it is capable of automating 
manufacturing processes by connecting humans, machines, and manufacturing pro­
cesses [8].
Cloud manufacturing is emerging as a new manufacturing paradigm which 
applies well-known basic concepts from cloud computing to manufacturing pro­
cesses and deliver shared, ubiquitous, on-demand manufacturing services. It is an 
innovative, web-based manufacturing model. It is promising to transform today’s 
manufacturing industry from production-oriented to service-oriented, highly col­
laborative manufacturing of the future.
Cloud manufacturing is a service-oriented, knowledge-based smart manufactur­
ing system. It is integrated with cloud computing technology, Internet of Things, 
and high-performance computing. Through cloud manufacturing, manufacturing 
resources (such as manufacturing software tools, manufacturing equipment, and 
manufacturing capabilities) are “virtualized” and offered as consumable in the 
same way as electricity, gas, and water. The manufacturing resources are provided 
to users as services over the Internet (cloud) in a pay-as-you-go manner [11, 12].
Cloud manufacturing is inspired by cloud computing. Cloud computing enables 
manufacturers to use new forms of production systems such as 3D printing (additive 
manufacturing), industrial robots, and high-performance computing. Just as cloud 
computer share pool of computing resources, cloud manufacturing enables on-
demand network access to a shared poor of manufacturing resources such as manu­
facturing equipment, software, materials, storage, assets, and capabilities. CM is 
regarded as Manufacturing-as-a-Service (MaaS) and is expected to help the

enterprise achieve the business benefits of reducing the idle capacity and increasing 
utilization [13, 14].
There are two types of cloud computing adoptions in manufacturing: adapting 
cloud computing technologies directly to manufacturing or using the manufacturing 
version of cloud computing, which is known as cloud manufacturing.

	1.	 Manufacturing resource layer: This includes the physical resources (e.g., hard­
ware; software) and capabilities.
	2.	 Virtual service layer: This identifies and virtualizes manufacturing resources and 
capabilities and packages them on the cloud as services. Supporting technolo­
gies include RFID, wireless sensor networks, industrial Internet, cyber physical 
systems, and cloud computing.
	3.	 Global service layer: This controls the entire operational activities of the cloud 
and enables effective interconnection between physical and cyber objects 
through industrial Internet.
	4.	 Application layer: Provides an interface between the user and cloud services.

13.4  Migrating to the Cloud
Any company in the manufacturing business must fight to stay relevant and 
competitive.
Manufacturing companies of all sizes can benefit greatly from cloud computing. 
Companies small and big must realize that the cloud offers them a way to improve 
operations and reduce time. A manufacturer can migrate to the cloud by taking the 
following three key steps [16]:
	1.	 Define your business objectives: Create clarity around how, exactly, you expect 
cloud solutions to maximize business efficiency. The idea here is that cloud 
should not simply provide a new way of provisioning IT resources—but enable 
better ways to operate. You may need an effective strategic partner for your cloud 
migration. It is recommended to find a partner that has all the futures that are 
important to your business.
	2.	 Clarify your IT expectations: Next, clearly define which kinds of IT benefits to 
optimize for. Your list might include items like reduced IT infrastructure foot­
prints at manufacturing sites, better price-to-performance ratios due to the 
­scaling flexibility of cloud solutions, better disaster-recovery capabilities, and 
automation.
	3.	 Prioritize cloud security: Finally, shape your cloud security strategy, gover­
nance, and infrastructure. Given how your cloud solutions will connect to 
business-­critical IT and operational technology infrastructure, having these in 
place is a must.
13  Cloud Manufacturing

191
13.5  Applications
Manufacturing is a critical component of many businesses. Here are some of the 
sectors where companies are already utilizing cloud manufacturing [17]:
•	 Automobile
•	 Aerospace
•	 Electronics
•	 Retail
•	 Pharmaceutical
•	 Food and beverage
•	 Distribution
•	 Furniture
There are several ways the cloud can be used in manufacturing. Some common 
applications of cloud manufacturing include:
•	 Automation: This can have a huge benefit on your company. Its importance to the 
manufacturing industry will continue to skyrocket. CM quickens deployments 
and the production by automating communication between manufacturing and 
accounting. For example, customer services is as important in manufacturing as 
it is any other business. The cloud offers technologies for automating customer 
service, taking orders online, and allowing users to check the status of orders at 
any time. As automation adaption increases, automated equipment and process 
monitoring become important.
•	 Machining Industry: The machine-tool manufacturing enterprises use cloud 
manufacturing to develop intelligent machine tools and novel business models to 
increase their competitiveness and gain profits [18].
•	 Cloud Robotics: The availability of new technologies, such as computing cloud 
and big data, and their possible uses in robotics have led to a new line of research 
called cloud robotics, which are used for grasping and navigation. The use of 
cloud robotics is based on the integration of cloud computing and industrial 
robots. Storing large amounts of data in the cloud is a key solution addressing 
robot limitations [19, 20].
•	 Electronic Industry: The concept of cloud manufacturing has been applied to the 
semiconductor manufacturing operations such as to wafer fab simulation, chain 
management, test operations management [21]. With cloud manufacturing, PCB 
prototyping should be faster.
•	 Cloud-Based Marketing: The comprehensive nature of cloud technology makes 
it suitable for marketing campaigns. Manufacturers use cloud-based applications 
to aid in planning, executing, and managing marketing campaigns and also to 
track the effectiveness of marketing campaigns [22].
•	 Product Development: Cloud manufacturing software is increasingly sought out 
by companies with heavy production components because it serves as a tool that 
assists companies in streamlining and visualizing the production process from 
creation to distribution. As a cloud-based solution, these systems provide mobile 
support that allows employees in the field or on the production floor to access 
important information at various locations anytime and anywhere [23].
13.5  Applications

192
13.6  Benefits
For manufacturers, the cloud provides endless possibilities for networking and shar­
ing resources. The cloud manufacturing is becoming popular with manufacturers 
because it caters to their needs and provides services at lower cost. It is helping 
businesses redefine their niche and rebrand themselves so they can attain new manu­
facturing heights. It is an excellent choice for companies with small IT departments 
and ideal for companies with no IT. The IT team does not have to deal with the 
upkeep of the software. This results in reduction in capital expenditure. Using 
cloud-based systems to streamline key areas of their business, manufacturers are 
freeing up more time to invest in new products and selling more [24]. It supports the 
needs of small businesses by making small quantity runs affordable. It enables an 
organization or a business to find a manufacturing service partner that offers real-­
time quotes online.
Other benefits of cloud manufacturers include the following [25–29]:
•	 Sustainability: Sustainability should be at the top of the list of considerations of 
manufacturers. The major reason for the growing popularity in cloud manufac­
turing is its sustainability. Manufacturers should change the ways they imple­
ment operations, use data, engage with customers, and create an overall more 
sustainable ecosystem. This can be achieved with a cloud-based strategy.
•	 Scalability: Cloud computing can grow with the business or can easily scale back 
during slower times.
•	 Reliability: Cloud-based software technology has fewer technical problems than 
software used on individual computers.
•	 Cost-Effectiveness: Cloud solutions do not require in-house servers. Cost is one 
of the leading factors when manufacturers choose cloud-based solutions for 
enhancements to their ERP software. The cloud can make a difference in mini­
mizing costs in manufacturing operations.
•	 Short Go-To-Market Times: Cloud manufacturing clearly reduces the go-to-­
market times. Cloud solutions improve turnaround time and reduce time to mar­
ket for enhancement of market share.
•	 Marketplace Advantage Over Companies Not Using Cloud Technology: Better 
productivity and communications give companies that use cloud manufacturing 
solutions a competitive edge.
•	 Centralized Management: Access programs can be deployed from any computer 
in the organization, improving management capabilities.
•	 Less Points of Failure: Cloud manufacturing encompasses all steps from quoting 
to delivery. Therefore, there is only one point of contact and less points of pos­
sible failure.
•	 Updated Equipment: Technology based in the cloud stays updated without IT 
departments wasting time to ensure that everyone has the latest version of the 
software. Cloud-based solutions eliminate the delays, errors, and frustrations 
common in the traditional email-and-wait experience. Users or manufacturers do 
not need to invest on high-end computers or worry about software upgrades or 
13  Cloud Manufacturing

193
updates. The cloud eliminates the challenge of regularly updating equipment and 
machinery as one can upgrade them without a huge upfront cost. Instead, one 
pays a monthly fee to access the necessary resources.
•	 Minimal Environmental Impact: Cloud manufacturing can significantly reduce 
the environmental impact of making and moving goods around the world. It 
enables customers to make choices about designs and materials that can lead to 
more sustainable parts.
•	 Prototyping: Prototyping is a traditionally difficult part of the product develop­
ment process. Cloud manufacturing is designed to make it easy, inexpensive, and 
quick to produce prototypes and small batches. This allows designers to iterate, 
improve, and deliver on time.
•	 Location Irrelevance: The cloud has introduced the notion of “location irrele­
vance” to manufacturing. According to this concept, it should not matter where 
the product stays, whether you make it, or somebody makes it for you. This is 
especially true for modern manufacturing where product planners, designers, 
and manufacturers who collaborate do not need to be at the same specific loca­
tion at the same time.
13.4
 
13.6  Benefits

194
13.7  Challenges
There are some inherent drawbacks in adopting cloud-based applications. CM is in 
its infancy, and there are lot of problems that need to be resolved for it to 
become mature.
There is lack of software frameworks to support cloud manufacturing. Other 
challenges include the following [4, 30–32]:
•	 Security: Data security is a key concern. The main challenge involves the secu­
rity for mission critical applications. Manufacturers need to be able to share 
information without exposing sensitive and confidential materials such as their 
intellectual property. Trust and reputation play crucial roles in the service-­
oriented network manufacturing paradigm.
•	 Data Breaches: With manufacturing emerging as a hot industry, data breaches 
are common. Cybercriminals both within and outside a company are waiting for 
opportune moments to exfiltrate sensitive data for espionage and monetary gains. 
Manufacturing’s most commonly compromised data includes credentials, inter­
nal operations data, confidential patents and invention disclosures, and other 
company secrets.
•	 Continuing Costs: Although the subscription cost of a cloud-based system may 
be an advantage in most cases, it is observed that a cloud-based solution has no 
upfront investment; nonetheless, there is an ongoing monthly fee to use the ser­
vice. Regular updates could bring on additional costs.
•	 Lack of Standard: To enable seamless switching between factories, tooling and 
materials must be standardized to be readily consumed by the given factory. The 
manufacturing industry lacks a uniform data standard because of the wide vari­
ety of manufacturing resources and business demand, supply, spare-parts varia­
tions, and order volatility. There is an added challenge of a missing standardized 
communication protocol across different machinery equipment from different 
providers.
•	 Human Factors: These can have a pivotal role in enabling the adoption of CM, 
while ensuring the safety and well-being of users involved in a CM environment.

13.8  Global Cloud Manufacturing
Cloud manufacturing (CM) has emerged as a service-oriented paradigm that enables 
modularization and on-demand servitization or the on-demand and complete rein­
venting of the manufacturing business model and its associated resources. In order 
13  Cloud Manufacturing

195
 
for manufacturers worldwide to remain relevant and competitive in the highly 
dynamic new environment, they need to look toward digital transformation, specifi­
cally with cloud manufacturing. Every business should be regarded as being on a 
digital journey. North America has the maximum global cloud manufacturing mar­
ket coverage as several market leaders belong to this zone. We now consider how 
some nations adopt cloud manufacturing.
•	 United States: The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
defines cloud computing (CC) as “a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, 
on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources 
(e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly 
provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider 
interaction.” Cloud computing is emerging as one of the major enablers for the 
manufacturing industry. Building on NIST’s definition of CC, CM is regarded as 
a computing and service-oriented manufacturing model developed from existing 
advanced manufacturing models [33]. Most of US manufacturers are reluctant to 
adopt cloud manufacturing. The state of American manufacturing has become 
debatable. On the one hand, manufacturing is seen as a struggling sector of the 
economy. Twenty years ago, US manufacturing employed approximately 17 mil­
lion Americans. However, today, that number has fallen to just 12 million, a loss 
of five million jobs. Cloud computing is changing the manufacturing paradigm 
for large and small manufacturers. It is innovating, reducing cost, and bolstering 
the competitiveness of American manufacturing. For example, automakers such 
as Ford, Tesla, and Hyundai (among others) are using the cloud to deliver over-­
13.8  Global Cloud Manufacturing

196
the-­air updates to vehicles’ powertrain, infotainment, navigation, and safety sys­
tems. Ford is piloting a cloud-based solution on Google Earth to enable virtual 
navigation of its assembly plants. Drug-maker Pfizer has leveraged cloud com­
puting to completely re-engineer its complex global supply chain. Merck has 
successfully leveraged cloud computing to improve its manufacturing process 
for vaccines [34].
•	 United Kingdom: UK economic prosperity increasingly depends on developing 
and maintaining a resilient and sustainable manufacturing sector. The sector 
must be capable of producing a variety of products faster, better, and more afford­
able. It should also minimize the use of materials, energy, transport, and resources 
while maximizing environmental sustainability and economic competitive­
ness [5].
•	 China: The manufacturing industry is an important pillar of China’s economy. 
The Chinese government regards manufacturing technology as a strategic mea­
sure for realizing modernization and industrialization. Advanced manufacturing 
tools can be used to improve product quality, service, testing, training, usage, 
maintenance, and energy efficiency. Production costs and development times are 
also reduced. Service, resource environment, and knowledge-based innovation 
are key factors for enhancing core competitiveness in the manufacturing indus­
try. In 2009, China became the world’s second largest industrialized manufactur­
ing country, second only to the United States. However, it has not yet turned into 
a high-end manufacturing power. “Made in China” is generally considered to be 
at the low end of the international value chain. The concept of cloud manufactur­
ing was proposed for promoting the development of manufacturing 
­informatization. Research into cloud manufacturing technology will accelerate 
the development of an intelligently networked, service-oriented manufacturing 
industry in China [35, 36].
13.9  Future of Cloud Manufacturing
Cloud manufacturing enable manufacturing organization to manage their portfolio 
of products using the same tools software companies have been leveraging for 
years. Cloud manufacturing is the next great advance in lean production. Cloud-­
based manufacturing will be the industry’s future because it represents the future of 
how things will be fabricated. That is good for both manufacturers and consumers. 
Cloud manufacturing is poised to become the new service-oriented manufacturing 
mode. It is the future of manufacturing.
The future development of cloud manufacturing will face some challenges. 
Besides the integration technologies of cloud computing, Internet of Things, and 
embedded systems, several important technical issues must be solved such as cloud 
management engines, collaboration between cloud manufacturing applications, and 
visualization and user interfaces in cloud environments.
13  Cloud Manufacturing

197
As of now, most companies are not ready to run high-speed manufacturing pro­
duction systems in the cloud, but there should be no doubt that cloud technology is 
coming into manufacturing [37]. Now is the right time for manufacturers to embrace 
the cloud. Manufacturing leaders must remember that not evolving and not embrac­
ing change means to be out of business.
13.10  Conclusion
Cloud manufacturing is a new manufacturing model that is service oriented, knowl­
edge based, high performance, and energy efficient. It is a service-oriented, data-­
centric, and demand-driven business model to share manufacturing capabilities and 
resources on a cloud platform. The concept of cloud manufacturing has started to 
impact all walks of life (government, industry, academia, research). CM is trans­
forming the traditional manufacturing business model, while helping the manufac­
turer to create intelligent factory networks that enable collaboration across the 
whole enterprise. Most companies are just scratching the surface of realizing their 
data’s potential. Today, manufacturers face the choice to embrace cloud technology 
or risk losing out on competitiveness in the ever-evolving marketplace.
Although cloud manufacturing is still in the infant stage of development, it is 
gaining significant attention from academia, industry, and government. Every busi­
ness should be embraced by the cloud manufacturing granted the immense opportu­
nities it offers for stimulating rapid industrial growth, sustained job creation, and 
enhanced profits. More information on cloud manufacturing can be found in the

Nanomanufacturing
14.1  Introduction
The nanoworld is a mysterious place because materials behave differently at the 
atomic or nanoscale. The discovery of higher resolution microscopes in the 1980s 
enabled having insight into nanoscale material structures and their properties. 
Nanotechnology (science on the scale of single atoms and molecules) has been 
identified as the “fourth industrial revolution” to disrupt the modern world. It is so 
described because of the special properties of materials at the nanoscale. It has per­
meated all sectors of our economy due to the unique properties of materials at the 
nanoscale. It is transforming the world of materials and its influence will be broad. 
It will not only initiate the next industrial revolution, but it will also offer techno­
logical solutions.
Nanotechnology refers to the science of nanomaterials. It is the measuring, mod­
eling, and manipulating of matter at atomic scale or in the dimension of 1–100 
nanometers (nm). (A nanometer is 1 billionth of a meter). It offers the opportunity 
to produce new structures, materials, and devices with unique properties such as 
conductivity, strength, and chemical reactivity. Electrical and mechanical properties 
can change at the nanoscale. For example, at the nanoscale, gold becomes an active 
catalyst, helping to turn chemicals X and Y into product Z. Most nanomaterials are 
made by chemical processes, which may or may not generate pollutants or waste 
materials [1].
Manufacturing is the major industry for promoting economic and social develop­
ment. It is a dynamic, ever-evolving industry, with newer and better technologies 
being developed on a regular basis. Nanomanufacturing is the manufacturing pro­
cesses of objects or materials with dimensions between one and 100 nm. It is the 
scaled-up, cost-effective manufacturing of nanoscale materials, structures, devices, 
and systems. It focuses on developing scalable, high-yield processes for the produc­
tion of materials, structures, devices, and systems at the nanoscale.
We believe that if this technology has a future, we will need to 
have a large research community working on it.

This chapter provides an introduction to nanomanufacturing. It begins by giving 
an overview of nanotechnology and nanomanufacturing. It presents same applica­
tions of nanomanufacturing. It highlights some benefits and challenges of nano­
manufacturing. It covers the essence of global nanomanufacturing and the future of 
nanomanufacturing. The last section concludes with comments.
14.2  Overview of Nanotechnology
We must first understand what nanotechnology is about before we can understand 
nanomanufacturing. Techniques are now available which make it possible to manip­
ulate materials on the atomic or molecular scale to produce objects which are no 
more than a few nanometers in diameter. The processes used to make and manipu­
late such materials are known as nanotechnology; the materials or objects them­
selves are called nanomaterials, and the study and discovery of these materials are 
known as nanoscience. Thus, nanotechnology is basically the control of matter and 
processes at the nanoscale.
Nanotechnology involves the manipulation of matter at the atomic and molecular 
scales. It is emerging as a principal discipline that is integrating chemistry and mate­
rial science. It holds the promise of being a main driver of technology with signifi­
cant impact for all aspects of society. It is an interdisciplinary field covering physics, 
chemistry, biology, materials science, and engineering [2].
Richard Feynman, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist, introduced the world to 
nanotechnology in 1959. The term “nanotechnology” was coined in 1974 by Norio 
Taniguchi, a professor at Tokyo Science University. Nanotechnology involves the 
manipulation of atoms and molecules at the nanoscale so that materials have new 
unique properties. Nanotechnology is a multidisciplinary field that includes biol­
ogy, chemistry, physics, material science, and engineering. It is the science of small 
things—at the atomic level or nanoscale level [3]. Nanotechnology also includes 
domains like nanoscience, nanomaterials, nanomedicine, nanomeasurement, nano­
manipulation, nanoelectronics, and nanorobotics.
Nanotechnology is the science of small things—at the atomic level or nanoscale 
level. It has the idea that the technology of the future will be built on atoms. It has 
impact on every area of science and technology. Nanotechnology involves imaging, 
measuring, modeling, and manipulating matter at the nanoscale. At this level, the 
physical, chemical, and biological properties of materials fundamentally differ from 
the properties of individual atoms and molecules or bulk matter [4].
Nanotechnology covers a wide variety of disciplines like physics, chemistry, 
biology, biotechnology, information technology, engineering, and their potential 
applications.

It has given manufacturers new and better ways to produce materials of varying 
strengths, weights, volumes, surface areas, lengths, and thicknesses.

Widespread commercialization of nanotechnologies has been restricted by lack 
of the means to produce these technologies at scale. Therefore, the next major step 
facing nanotechnologists is figuring out how to move from laboratory discoveries to 
commercial products, i.e., how to manufacture devices with nanoscale features in a 
cost-effective manner.
14.3  Nanomanufacturing
Nanotechnology has only come into wide use in the manufacturing sector recently. 
A series of breakthroughs in materials and designs have allowed manufacturers to 
work at scales smaller than a billionth of a meter. Nanomanufacturing (or nanofab­
rication) is manufacturing at the nanoscale. The terms “nanofabrication” and “nano­
manufacturing” are often used interchangeably. Nanomanufacturing (may be 
regarded as a set of industrial processes based on nanotechnology used in develop­
ing products at the nanoscale. It involves reliable and cost-effective manufacturing 
of nanoscale materials, structures, devices, and systems. This area is increasingly 
dynamic, with supporting advanced technologies that are vital when manufacturing 
parts or features at such small scales are emerging weekly. It is an interdisciplinary 
field covering physics, chemistry, biology, materials science, and engineering.
Some key features of nanomanufacturing are discussed as follows [6, 7]:

Various processes have been developed under the categories of bottom-up and 
top-down nanomanufacturing. Some of the more common processes include the 
following [8]:
•	 Chemical vapor deposition (CVD): This process is used to make materials from 
a series of chemical reactions. CVD is often employed in the semiconductor 
industry, where it is used to create film strips with silicone, carbon, and filaments.
•	 Molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE): A process used to deposit thin films.
•	 Atomic layer epitaxy (ALE): A process where layers comprised of single-atom 
thickness are deposited onto surfaces.
•	 Dip-pen nanolithography (DPN): A process that resembles the functions of an 
ink pen; DPN involves the use of a chemically saturated microscopic tip, which 
is used to write on surfaces. A lithograph that heats above 100 °C is capable of 
fabricating metal electrodes far more effectively than a conventional elec­
tron beam.
•	 Nanoimprint lithography (NIL): A nanoscale stamping process where features 
are imprinted onto a surface.
•	 Roll-to-roll processing: A process where ultrathin strips of metal and plastic are 
imprinted with nanoscale devices at a very high frequency.
•	 Self-assembly: A set of processes where different elements are brought together 
without process intervention, to form a structure.
14  Nanomanufacturing

205
	2.	 Nanomaterials in Manufacturing: A nanomaterial (NM) (or nano-sized mate­
rial) is the material with any external dimension in the nanoscale. Nanomaterials 
are basically chemical substances or materials that are manufactured and used at 
a very small scale.
For example, miniaturization enables microprocessors developed using these 
parts, to operate faster. However, there are a number of technical challenges to 
achieving these advancements, such as the lack of ultrafine precursors to make these 
parts, inadequate dissipation of the large amounts of heat generated by these micro­
processors, and poor reliability. Nanomaterials help overcome these barriers by 
offering manufacturers materials with better thermal conductivity, nanocrystalline 
starting materials, ultra-high-purity materials, and materials with longer-lasting, 
and more durable interconnections. The use of nanoparticles in the manufacturing 
industry will continues to grow [9].
	3.	 Nanomanufacturing Methods: Specialized equipment and techniques are neces­
sary to manipulate matter at the nanoscale. There are many methods for this, 
including self-assembly, photolithography, and dip-pen lithography. Self-­
assembly means that a group of nanocomponents has to come together to form 
an organized structure. This self-assembly would occur from the bottom-up. 
Photolithography is analogous to the negative obtained with film, as it uses light 
exposure to project images. Dip-pen lithography relies on and enables the tip of 
an atomic force microscope to be imbued with chemicals that are subsequently 
used to create patterns.
14.3

14.4  Applications
Nanomanufacturing is revolutionizing many manufacturing sectors, including 
information technology, defense, medicine, transportation, energy, environmental 
science, telecommunications, and electronics. Common applications of nanomanu­
facturing include [11, 12]:
•	 Automotive and Aerospace: The manufacturing industry will experience huge 
developments in sectors like automotive and aerospace. Nanotechnology is used 
in the auto industry, to create batteries, fuel cells, and converters that yield higher 
efficiencies. Tire manufacturers are increasingly using polymer nanocomposites 
to increase the durability and wear resistance of tires. Since nanotechnology cre­
ates smaller and lighter crafts, less fuel will be needed to pilot aircraft.
•	 Healthcare: Nanotechnologies have enabled engineers and clinicians to collabo­
rate in solving complex problems which require advanced nanomanufacturing 
capabilities to develop medical applications. Introducing these technologies and 
disseminating these results to healthcare engineering will greatly benefit the 
majority of population in developing and under-developed countries that would 
14.4  Applications

206
 
10
be enabled to receive appropriate and affordable medical care, to achieve 
improvements in their quality of life.
•	 Nanomaterials: Popular nanomaterials, like carbon nanotubes, are already 
widely fabricated and applied in the manufacture of a variety of goods, including 
sailboat hulls, bicycle frames, and spaceship components. Nanotechnology can 
also be used to create more effective and stable lubricants, which are useful in a 
variety of industrial applications.
•	 Electronics: In electronics, nanotechnology enables the manufacture of tiny elec­
tronics and electric devices, like nanoscale transistors made of carbon nanotubes. 
In electronics, design at the nanoscale is creating highly flexible devices and 
circuit boards. Today, the only industry where nanomanufacturing is employed 
on a large scale is the semiconductor industry. The feature sizes of semiconduc­
tor devices have shrunk.
•	 Nanomachines: Nanotechnology has shown serious in nanomachines or 
nanites—mechanical or robotic devices that operate at the nanoscale. Nanoscale 
robots (called nanomachines or nanites) may soon revolutionize medical device 
construction. Nanomachines are, for the most part, future technologies that are 
not widely used in manufacturing right now.
•	 Additive Nanomanufacturing: Additive manufacturing has provided a quick way 
to fabricate inexpensive specialized components and spare parts. It cost-­
effectively lowers manufacturing inputs and outputs in small batch production. It 
is used by engineers for rapid prototyping and low-volume production. At the 
14  Nanomanufacturing

207
nanoscale, additive nanomanufacturing provides a future path for new nanotech­
nology applications. It empowers smaller facilities to design, create, and manu­
facture on their own [13].
•	 Drug Delivery: One of the major challenges in development of nano-based drug 
delivery is its large-scale production. This includes manufacturing nanodevices 
below 20 nm. Producing nano drugs on a large scale requires the integration of 
methods as well as transfer of technology for the production of nano drugs at a 
large scale. A properly designed scale-up production reduces time and improves 
cost-effectiveness [14].
•	 Self-Assembly: As miniaturization reaches the nanoscale, conventional manufac­
turing technologies fail. Self-assembly is essentially one strategy for organizing 
matter on larger scales. It has become an important concept in nanotechnology. 
The key to using self-assembly, as a controlled and directed fabrication process, 
lies in designing the components that are required to self-assemble into desired 
patterns and functions. Until robotic assemblers capable of nanofabrication can 
be built, self-assembly will be the necessary technology required to develop for 
bottom-up fabrication. For example, IBM announced their self-assembling struc­
tures in their airgap processors. Self-assembly is the reason that nanotechnolo­
gies have such an extensive influence on the chemical market [15].
14.4
14.5  Benefits
Nanotechnology is regarded as the driving force behind a new industrial revolution. 
It presents opportunities to create new and better products. Many manufacturers are 
using nanotechnology to make products with improved capabilities or to reduce 
their manufacturing cost. Nanomanufacturing is flexible and is poised to meet cus­
tomer needs and would support sustainable manufacturing as well as molecular 
manufacturing. It is widely regarded as critical to realizing practical applications of 
nanotechnology in areas such as nanoelectronics, nanobiotechnology, nanoscale 
structures, devices, and systems.
•	 Small, but Mighty: It is commonly said all things begin small, and nanotechnol­
ogy is not an exception. Nanomanufacturing and nanotechnology deal with par­
ticles which are a hundred thousand times smaller than the width of a human hair.
•	 Miniaturization: Nanomanufacturing benefits from miniaturizing the compo­
nents because scaling down emitters implies less power consumption, less bias 
voltage to operate them, and higher throughput.
•	 Superior Performance: Nanomanufacturing plays an important role for high per­
formance products in several applications. Nanomaterials can provide superior 
14.5  Benefits

208
 
products in areas such as medicine, electronics, biomaterials, and consumer 
products.
•	 Improve Efficiency: Nanomanufacturing will improve efficiency in a number of 
operations, from design to packaging and to the transportation of goods.
14.6  Challenges
Nanomanufacturing is currently very much in its infancy. Nanomanufacturing pres­
ents unique challenges not inherent in traditional manufacturing. In many nano­
manufacturing processes, the execution of many runs is not practical due to limited 
resources. It is challenging to maintain nanoscale properties and quality of nano-­
system during high-rate and high-volume production as well as during the lifetime 
of the product after production. Nanomanufacturing is energy-intensive in terms of 
material processing and nano-feature manufacturing. It is currently difficult to 
assess the environmental, ethical, and social impacts of nanomanufacturing. Some 
other challenges of nanomanufacturing include [16]:
14  Nanomanufacturing

209
•	 High Cost: The commercial production of nanotechnology components often 
involves vast resources. For example, high-quality graphene is still very hard to 
manufacture in large quantities. Nanomanufacturing is dominated by lithogra­
phy tools that are too expensive for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) 
to invest in.
•	 Limited Commercialization: Nanomanufacturing has been restricted by the lack 
of driving applications and the inability to produce nanotechnology devices at 
commercial scales, including mass production. Current nanomanufacturing pro­
cesses may be wasteful and expensive if applied on a commercial scale. Scaling 
down assembly lines to the nano level is difficult.
•	 Defect Removal: Another challenge is testing reliability and establishing meth­
ods for defect control. Currently, defect control in the semiconductor industry is 
nonselective and takes 20–25% of the total manufacturing time. Removal of 
defects for nanoscale system is projected to take up much more time because it 
requires selective and careful removal of impurities.
•	 Overexposure: Harvesting nanomaterials from reactors results in high-risk expo­
sures. Packing nanomaterials tends to release relatively large agglomerates of 
nanomaterials into the workplace. Protecting workers from health effects from 
overexposure to nanomaterials in the manufacturing environment is challenging.
•	 Health Effects: Concerns about the health effects of nanoparticles and nanofibers 
imply that calls for the tighter regulation of nanotechnology are growing. Based 
on some concerns regarding environmental, health, and safety (EHS) issues, sig­
nificant research is needed to understand the risks associated with nanomaterials. 
Much remains unknown about EHS risks.
•	 Required Skill: Nanomanufacturing requires new skills that are needed for these 
high-tech manufacturing jobs. This may require specialized education, such as 
powder processing and metallurgical extraction.
There are some major challenges for nanomanufacturing to overcome before it 
can really start to fulfil its potential. The challenges are so complex that a multidis­
ciplinary team of experts is needed to address them. The challenges may hamper 
attempts to transition nanotechnology from R&D to full-scale manufacturing. Even 
with the challenges, nanomanufacturing is still making inroads relative to advance­
ment in nanotechnology.
14.7  Global Nanomanufacturing
Nanotechnology is constantly being researched and developed at laboratories all 
over the world. The promise of nanomanufacturing is such that a lot of money will 
be spent on research by national governments. We now consider how some nations 
pursue nanomanufacturing.
•	 United States: Many view the United States as the world’s premier nanotechnol­
ogy research and development (R&D) nation. The National Nanomanufacturing 
14.7  Global Nanomanufacturing

210
Network (NNN) is an alliance of academic, government, and industry partners 
who are committed to advance nanomanufacturing in the United States. In 2000, 
the US government established the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), as 
a nanotechnology R&D initiative. NNI was created with the goal of making the 
United States a global leader in nanotechnology. NNI partners with several cen­
ters across the United States to develop nanotechnology applications. 
Nanotechnology is revolutionizing many manufacturing sectors, including infor­
mation technology, defense, medicine, transportation, energy, environmental sci­
ence, telecommunications, and electronics.

•	 European Union: In Europe, the manufacturing industry is facing a growing 
pressure derived from competitive economies. The number of consumer prod­
ucts claiming to contain nanomaterials doubles every 18 months. The European 
Society for Precision Engineering and Nanotechnology (euspen) is an influential 
community linking industrialists, researchers, and established players world­
wide. Its mission is to advance the arts, sciences, and technology of nanotechnol­
14  Nanomanufacturing

211
ogy, to promote its dissemination through education and training, and to facilitate 
its exploitation by science and industry. Euspen (www.euspen.eu) provides an 
entrepreneurial platform that enables companies and research institutions to pro­
mote their latest technology developments, products, and services [18]. It has 
been hosting conferences and events in nanomanufacturing for almost 20 years, 
bringing together leading experts from industry, R&D, and academia.
•	 Australia: Australia and Victoria have an active and advanced industry based on 
the manufacture of small particles. Australian manufacturers are the global pio­
neers in a number of advanced manufacturing areas, including advanced nano­
material applications. This has made Australia to be the largest export earner in 
the global manufacturing industry. For example, advanced manufacturing 
accounted for $21.1 billion (18.3%) of all Australian export in 2001. Research 
institutions and industries across Australia have created nanocoating technolo­
gies that can be used in a wide range of applications [19].
•	 United Kingdom: The Nanomanufacturing Hub was established at the University 
of Surrey in UK with the purpose of fostering new collaborative developments in 
nanoscience and nanotechnology, from materials and characterization to devices 
and applications. The Hub will make the manufacturing of smart materials and 
self-powered electronics a reality in the United Kingdom. It brings together 
researchers with an international outlook in advanced materials and technologies 
such as nanotechnology. It will support small and medium-sized enterprises 
through the lower technology readiness levels (TRL) that require more research 
input and experience. A team of researchers are needed to cover the range of 
materials science, device design and physics, device fabrication, characteriza­
tion, and testing [20]. Smart Nano NI is a Northern Ireland consortium involving 
local industry leading organizations working together on smart manufacturing. 
The consortium will provide opportunities for knowledge transfer to high-growth 
sectors across the whole United Kingdom [21].
14.8  Future of Nanomanufacturing
Nanotechnology has come to be applied to a wide range of small-scale engineering. 
It promises almost an indefinite range of applications in medicine, optics, commu­
nications, electronics, space, etc. The concept of manufacturing at nanoscale covers 
a host of different materials, devices, products, and processes. Nanoscale manufac­
turing is affecting many sectors of the economy and is having widely transformative 
impacts. It has the potential to set the pace for improvements across a wide range of 
industrial sectors. It could open new world markets.
The future of nanomanufacturing is bright, but progress will not come cheap. 
The future will be dictated by the trend of decreasing component sizes, material 
usages, and energy consumption of products. Resourceful R&D will need to rely on 
funding to further the potential of nanomanufacturing.
14.8  Future of Nanomanufacturing

212
The global market for nanomaterials and nano-enabled products seems to be 
growing fast. To get a share of the market, a company must create and implement 
products fabricated by nanotechnology. Small companies looking for opportunities 
to try nanomanufacturing should find ways to embrace the revolution before it 
becomes mainstream.
14.9  Conclusion
Nanomanufacturing is the essential bridge between the discoveries of the nanosci­
ences and real-world nanotechnology products. It embraces the processes and tech­
niques utilized to produce nano-enabled products. It consists of a series of fabrication 
processes to build nanoscale structures and devices using nanotechnology. It is a 
relatively new branch of manufacturing that focuses on developing scalable, high-­
yield processes for the production of materials, structures, devices, and systems at 
the nanoscale.
Government agencies around the world are investing heavily in nanomanufactur­
ing research and development. These governments provide researchers with the 
facilities, equipment, and trained workers to develop nanotechnology applications 
and associated manufacturing processes. More information about nanomanufactur­
ing can be found in the books in [22–34] and the following related journals:

Ubiquitous Manufacturing
15.1  Introduction
Manufacturing encompasses the industrial production processes, through which 
raw materials are transformed into finished products, which can be sold in the mar­
ket to earn profits. The manufacturing gains could subsequently support organiza­
tional continuous improvement initiatives. Manufacturing is crucial to the national 
economy; it is the key element of industrial competitiveness. Manufacturing com­
panies are currently confronted with the challenges created by rapid technological 
changes. Today’s manufacturing enterprises have to deal with: (1) coverage of the 
whole product life cycle, (2) environmentally conscious manufacturing, (3) simul­
taneous improvement of productivity and sustainability, and (4) enhancement of the 
total performance of the product through its entire life cycle. Other challenges of 
current manufacturing organizations include time-to-market reduction, mass cus­
tomization realization, tougher multinational competition, flexibility, reconfigu­
rability requirements, and speed/quality/cost improvements in product development 
and manufacturing [1]. Thus, modern manufacturing requires a new generation of 
production systems with better interoperability and new business models. With the 
recent development of network technology, communication technology, sensor net­
work technology, and computing technology, manufacturing resources, services, 
facilities, and products can now be deployed ubiquitously.
The demand for highly customized products and the increasing popularity of 
outsourcing has given birth to the concept of ubiquitous manufacturing (UM). 
Ubiquitous manufacturing (UM or UbiM) is an application of ubiquitous computing 
(or pervasive computing), which is a concept where computing is made to appear 
everywhere and anywhere. UM emphasizes the mobility and dispersion of manu­
facturing resources, products, and users [2]. It may be regarded as a “design any­
where, make anywhere, sell anywhere, and at any time” paradigm.
Data is the kind of ubiquitous resource that we can shape to 
provide new innovations and new insights, and it’s all around 
us, and it can be mined very easily.

This chapter provides an introduction to ubiquitous manufacturing. It begins by 
providing some background on ubiquitous computing on which ubiquitous manu­
facturing is built. Then, it explains what ubiquitous manufacturing is all about. It 
describes technologies related to UM, the characteristics of UM, and its enabling 
technologies. It highlights the benefits and challenges of UM. It covers global ubiq­
uitous manufacturing. The last section concludes with comments.
15.2  Overview on Ubiquitous Computing
Modern computing has made an impact on our daily life through the usage of com­
munication technologies and the Internet. The need for using different devices that 
surround humans to communicate with each other at any time and any environment 
has introduced ubiquitous computing. Ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) is a con­
cept in which computing is performed at any location. It is about computers every­
where surrounding humans, communicating with each other, and interacting with 
people and environments. It is the next wave in computing evolution. It seeks to 
embed computers into our everyday lives in such ways as to render them invisible 
and allow them to be taken for granted. It aims to revolutionize the current paradigm 
of human-computer interaction. It will have a profound effect on the way we inter­
act with computers, devices, environment, and other people. Unlike desktop com­
puting, ubiquitous computing can occur using any device, in any location, and in 
any format. Devices that use ubicomp have constant availability and are always 
connected [3, 4].
The word “ubiquitous” means existing everywhere. Ubiquitous computing (or 
pervasive computing) refers to an environment that enables people to use a variety 
of information and communication services by networking anywhere, anytime 
without any interruption. It makes computing power available at all times and all 
places in a convenient way. This is the idea behind the concept of ubiquitous 
manufacturing.
Ubiquitous computing is also known as pervasive computing. Ubicomp environ­
ment is marked by anywhere, anytime, and anyone-based characteristics. The terms 
“ubiquitous computing” and “pervasive computing” are used interchangeably, but 
they are conceptually different. Ubiquitous computing involves a three-step pro­
cess: sense, compute, and actuate. It uses the advances in mobile computing and 
pervasive computing to present a global computing environment. Pervasive comput­
ing is invisible to human users; ubiquitous computing aims to provide pervasive 
computing environments to a human user as he moves from one place to another [5].
The term “ubiquitous computing” was coined by the late Mark Weiser around 
1988 while at the Electronics and Imaging Laboratory of the Xerox Palo Alto 
Research Center. Mark Weiser is widely regarded as the father of ubiquitous com­
puting. He had a vision of computing technology weaving itself into the very fabric 
of everyday life. He identified ubiquitous computing (many computers, one person) 
as the third generation of computing, following the first generation of mainframe

computing (one computer, many people) and the second generation of personal 
computing (one computer, one person). The fourth generation of computing, known 
as collective computing, has emerged over the past decade [6–9].

•	 Computing elements are not integrated in a single workstation but distributed as 
everyday objects in user’s work environment.
•	 The context-aware feature of ubiquitous environments is also called “situated­
ness.” It requires adapting behavior based on information sensed from the physi­
cal and computational environment.
•	 Use of inexpensive processors, thereby reducing memory and storage 
requirements.
•	 Capturing real-time attributes.
•	 Totally connected and constantly available computing devices.
•	 Improvised and dynamic interactions among applications.
•	 Relies on converging the Internet, wireless technology, and advanced electronics.
The purpose of these features is to allow users to perform their tasks more effec­
tively and efficiently. Ubiquitous computing is not just the omnipresence of compu­
tational systems; it represents new ways of thinking about human-machine 
interaction. We now live in a world where the number of computers exceeds the 
number of humans and are entering a many-to-one computer/human relationship. 
Ubiquitous computing truly is everywhere. From smartwatches to self-driving cars 
and everything in between. Ubiquitous computing is a paradigm, a lifestyle, and a 
technological way of thinking. This is one of the hallmarks that characterize the 
ubiquitous computing era [12].
15.2  Overview on Ubiquitous Computing

218
15.3  Ubiquitous Manufacturing
Manufacturing is a coordinated and harmonized process of all levels of production 
from acquiring raw materials to product retailing. The entire manufacturing process 
is complex and requires the synchronization of many subsystems at a different pro­
duction level. Since customers nowadays prefer highly customized products, mod­
ern manufacturing requires a new generation of production system with better 
interoperability and new business models. This leads to a need of a major change in 
the traditional production paradigm. The major change in manufacturing is from 
mass production and mass consumption to a new model that enables sustainable 
development. As a novel information technology, ubiquitous computing provides 
new service models and business opportunities for the manufacturing industry. This 
has given birth to the concept of ubiquitous manufacturing [13].
Ubiquitous manufacturing (UM), also known as ubiquitous factory, is an appli­
cation of ubiquitous computing in the manufacturing sector. The name suggests that 
one could control a whole production and retailing chain from anywhere in the 
world and at any time. The key achievement of the application of ubiquitous com­
puting in ubiquitous manufacturing is to provide the means for interconnected, 
smart objects. These smart objects can make the lives of users easier through auto­
mation. UM provides an environment in which manufacturing is done everywhere 
and anywhere.
The concept of ubiquitous manufacturing (UM) is a nontraditional classification 
of industry and the inclusion of market-oriented manufacturing. The concept carries 
the idea that one can control a whole production and retailing chain from anywhere 
in the world and at any time. The emergence of some advanced manufacturing inno­
vations and technologies, such as lean manufacturing, cloud manufacturing, manu­
facturing grid, global manufacturing, virtual manufacturing, agile manufacturing, 
Internet manufacturing, sustainability manufacturing, smart manufacturing, and 
additive manufacturing has contributed to ubiquitous manufacturing [14]. UM does 
not imply that products could be supplied ubiquitously, since manufacturing a prod­
uct ubiquitously is impossible.
Ubiquitous manufacturing is the next-generation manufacturing paradigm. UM 
enables ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand access to a shared pool of manufactur­
ing resources. It is one of the emerging production paradigms toward which manu­
facturing companies are evolving. In recent years, ubiquitous manufacturing has 
attracted great attention in both academia and industry [15, 16].
Ubiquitous manufacturing must meet the following four conditions, known as 
the location controls of UM [2]:
	1.	 Transporting finished goods is more expensive than transporting raw materials.
	2.	 Finished goods are larger, more fragile, or more perishable than raw materials.
	3.	 Raw materials are available ubiquitously.
	4.	 Manufacturers and their customers communicate closely.

15.4  Related Technologies
Advances in computer science and engineering, such artificial intelligence, context-­
aware applications, ubiquitous computing, cyber-physical systems (CPS), Internet 
of Things (IoT), Internet of Services (IoS), big data, cloud computing, virtualiza­
tion, and semantic networks are making their way into the industry. Unfortunately, 
these applications are isolated and not working together [17].
The emergence of advanced manufacturing technologies has led to ubiquitous 
manufacturing. Such technologies include lean manufacturing (LM), cloud manu­
facturing (CM), global manufacturing (GM), virtual manufacturing (VM), Internet 
manufacturing (IM), Industry 4.0, continuous manufacturing, agile manufacturing, 
additive manufacturing, chaordic manufacturing, etc. We hereby consider some of 
these technologies [18–24].
•	 Cloud manufacturing (CM): Recently, a cloud-based system is developed for 
ubiquitous manufacturing. Cloud manufacturing may be regarded as a ubiqui­
tous manufacturing system. Cloud technology offers on-demand service access 
and resource pooling in the computing market. CM enables ubiquitous, conve­
nient, on-demand network accesses to a shared pool of manufacturing resources, 
while UM emphasizes the mobility and dispersion of manufacturing resources 
and users. The cloud and ubiquitous manufacturing systems require effectiveness 
and permanent availability of resources. Both CM and UM grant factories unlim­
ited production capacity and permanent manufacturing service availability. 
Cloud manufacturing represents such a recent transformation where multiple 
cloud models sustain the needed ubiquity of resources. Cloud provides new ser­
vice models and business opportunities for the manufacturing industry.
•	 Smart manufacturing: There is a similarity between smart manufacturing sys­
tems and ubiquitous robotic systems, and effort is in progress to integrate ubiq­
uitous robotic technology into the smart factory. Compared to conventional 
manufacturing processes, smart manufacturing offers the advantage of distrib­
uted networked machines to complete different tasks through collaboration. In 
contrast to the service robotic domain, smart manufacturing systems are often in 
larger size.

Ubiquitous manufacturing can handle many problems that have not been prop­
erly solved by previous manufacturing paradigms. It suggests a nontraditional clas­
sification of industry and the inclusion of market-oriented manufacturers [27].

15.5  UM Characteristics
The application of ubiquitous technology is relatively new in the manufacturing 
sector. UM has the following characteristics [28]:
	1.	 UM is a “design anywhere, make anywhere, sell anywhere, and at any time” 
concept that allows manufacturers an unlimited production capacity and perma­
nent service availability.
	2.	 It applies integrated manufacturing technology (MT), information technology 
(IT), and ubiquitous technology (UT) to the manufacturing domain. MT is for 
effective production, IT is for communication, while UT is for data acquisition 
and transmission. The ubiquitous environment in the manufacturing domain is 
characterized by being capable of producing product-centric digitized 
information.
	3.	 Ubiquitous computing technologies address a wide range of issues in the manu­
facturing industry. Such issues include manufacturing processes and equipment, 
manufacturing management, and planning.
	4.	 UM is a web-based manufacturing system, which can improve the efficiency and 
quality of product design, production, life cycle integration, enterprise manage­
15  Ubiquitous Manufacturing

221
ment, and customer service. It transparently collects and utilizes data on product 
and product-related context.
	5.	 It supports real-time collaborative activities between stakeholders in a distrib­
uted environment.
	6.	 UM may be regarded as wireless manufacturing or e-manufacturing.
15.6  Enabling Technologies
Advances in electronics (e.g., sensors, mobile devices, information, and communi­
cation technology) have significantly contributed to the emergence of ubiquitous 
manufacturing. UM uses technologies such as personal digital assistant (PDA), web 
camera, global position system (GPS), ZigBee, mobile Internet, USN (Ubiquitous 
Sensor Network), and autonomous industrial mobile robots. It employs wireless 
devices integrated into the products, manufacturing machines, and the factories 
themselves. A factory can be small or complex. Thus, UM enabling technologies 
include [29]:
	1.	 Sensors: Ubiquitous sensing technologies include radio frequency identification 
(RFID), auto ID, virtual reality, GPS, and Wi-Fi. Sensors, machines, equipment, 
computers, products, etc., are equipped with embedded intelligence which 
makes them smart. A regular sensor can be converted into a ubiquitous sensor by 
connecting a networking module to it. The sensors (temperature, vibration, 
force, etc.) are used to monitor manufacturing processes. GPS has been used 
extensively in tracing the location of a delivered order. Wi-Fi has been applied 
for ubiquitous positioning, diagnoses, and control inside a factory.
	2.	 RFID: RFID (radio frequency identification) is a widely adopted wireless sensor 
technology in many industries. Manufacturing resources like machines, materi­
als, and personnel are equipped with RFID devices and they become smart man­
ufacturing objects. RFID technology enables real-time traceability, visibility, 
and interoperability in improving the performance of shop-floor planning, exe­
cution, and control of manufacturing systems.
	3.	 Robots: Industrial mobile robots are used in handling and transporting materials. 
This is appropriate for UM due to its flexibility and ability to communicate.
	4.	 Cloud Manufacturing: This represents a shift from production-oriented to 
service-­oriented manufacturing. It extends and adopts the concept of cloud com­
puting for manufacturing. It is applied extensively to manufacturing because it 
enables collaborative product design by designers in different locations.
Other underlying technologies include operating systems, Internet, microproces­
sors, artificial intelligence, mobile devices and mobile networking, middleware and 
software architecture, wireless sensor networks, machine-machine communication 
and human-machine interface, and user interfaces.
15.6  Enabling Technologies

222
15.7  Applications
Ubiquitous computing still holds lots of expectations and unopened doors and pos­
sibilities. As ubiquitous computing gains more footing, more applications will sur­
face, some of which are applicable to ubiquitous manufacturing as well. Some 
common applications of ubiquitous manufacturing are presented as follows.
•	 Automation: Apart from object and process automation, enhanced human-­
machine interaction allows better safety, when, for example, machines stop when 
a human comes too near. Of course, automatic safety will not be totally fool­
proof, as machines might need some time for stopping, and stopping is not 
always possible. The use of ubiquitous technology in manufacturing leads to 
automation. Increase in automation on the manufacturing floor reduces human 
intervention and requires fewer workers.

­industries use ubiquitous technologies to automate their processes and enhance 
production. The driving forces in the automotive and aviation industry include: 
increasing customer requirement, efficient design of the supply chain, product 
piracy, and recycling. Today, a car is more than a means of transportation for 
customers. Besides safety and comfort, customers expect some luxuries such as 
navigation, entertainment, and communication [31].

•	 Additive Manufacturing: This is also known as 3D printing. It refers to building 
components by depositing material layer upon layer. The use of additive manu­
facturing will be ubiquitous in the aerospace and defense industry. Additive 
­manufacturing will have a significant impact on the design of complex defense

15.7  Applications

224
and aerospace products that break existing engineering limitations. Therefore, 
AM’s penetration into the aerospace and defense value chain is poised to increase. 
The main advantage of additive manufacturing is its cost-effectiveness since 
there is no waste and the ability to design new components not before possible. 
It allows one to fabricate complex geometries that are not possible through tradi­
tional manufacturing techniques.
•	 Manufacturing Executive Systems: This is also known as collaborative produc­
tion management. The basic concept of MES is to add functions to planning, 
logging, and control that act and react in real-time. Although MES are not 
directly related to ubiquitous manufacturing, they are enabled by the information 
generated by ubiquitous systems. The elements of an integrated MES are com­
plete technical product description, resource management, planning and order 
management, performance monitoring, performance data recording, and infor­
mation management. Therefore, MES can easily be seen as a central component 
in ubiquitous manufacturing systems [33].
Other areas of applications of ubiquitous manufacturing include the pharmaceu­
tical industry, mobile communication, and the telecommunications industry.
15.8  Benefits
Ubiquitous manufacturing provides new service models and business opportunities 
for the manufacturing industry. The key advantage of ubiquitous technology is the 
digitalization and availability of more product data than ever before. The use of 
ubiquitous technology in manufacturing operations leads to ubiquity. Product qual­
ity is another competitive advantage. A big part of ubiquitous manufacturing is to 
make the manufacturing line more controllable. Introducing a UM service in conve­
nience stores would help the store achieve profitable business opportunities. The 
benefits of ubiquitous manufacturing have taken the industrial automation revolu­
tion “Industry 4.0” to new horizons. Other benefits include the following [16]:
•	 Ubiquitous Connectivity: The idea of ubiquitous connectivity helps broaden the 
discussion to include other ways of connecting. Many companies benefit from 
improving their engagement with always-connected customers. For example, a 
manufacturer connects sensors to equipment to reduce downtime and improve 
productivity. Sensors are no longer exceptional. They are everywhere, embedded 
in all kinds of objects and even in people.
•	 Cost Reduction: Ubiquitous technology produces connected devices and 
machines. Optimizing supply-chain issues, manufacturing, and maintenance 
issues drastically reduces wastage, energy consumption, and production down­
time. Areas where costs can be reduced significantly include energy cost, inven­
tory handling cost, downtime cost, maintenance cost, and labor cost.
•	 Flexible Production: To meet the dynamic production and market demand, fac­
tory logistics must support the flexible production requirements. The ubiquitous 
15  Ubiquitous Manufacturing

225
nature of ubiquitous manufacturing ensures to meet production flexibility. 
Ubiquitous technology is good at adapting to fit demand. Intelligent processes 
and tools enable faster, more cost-effective, quality-assured, and flexible produc­
tion. This increases competitiveness in the global market environment.
•	 Smart Factory: Efforts have been made to deploy ubiquitous robotic technology 
to the smart factory. This grants factories an unlimited production capacity and 
permanent manufacturing service availability. The smart factory should adjust 
product type and production capacity in real-time.
•	 On-Demand Access: Ubiquitous manufacturing supports a demand-driven man­
ufacturing approach. It provides an environment that enables on-demand net­
work access to pooled configurable manufacturing resources and thus helps the 
platform of manufacturing everywhere and anywhere. Using UM, products can 
be supplied ubiquitously.
•	 Quality Improvement: Ubiquitous manufacturing improves the throughput of the 
factory and the quality of the product. Improvement in product quality often 
leads to lower wastage, higher customer satisfaction, and improved sales. 
Improved quality product implies zero defects or error in the manufacturing 
process.
•	 Energy Efficiency: Manufacturing operations consumes a lot of energy. Carefully 
monitoring energy consumption and the wastage in every production stage is 
critical to saving energy and cost. Use of ubiquitous technology is very effective 
in monitoring, tailoring, and optimizing the energy consumption of each machine.
•	 Production Efficiency: The data collected from ubiquitous manufacturing helps 
operators to visualize the production efficiency and wastages and foresee any 
arising issues. Ubiquity allows the manufacturer to have better insights into 
supply-­chain issues, delivery status, and production efficiency matters.
•	 Improved Productivity: Today, the demand for manufacturing products is charac­
terized by small batches with varieties. In contrast to traditional manufacturing, 
ubiquitous manufacturing can produce small-lot products of different types more 
efficiently. As the production process is optimized, the average manufacturing 
routes are shrunk, and the utilization rate of machines and other resources is 
improved.
•	 Reduce Workforce: The use of ubiquitous technology in manufacturing leads to 
automation, which reduces human intervention and requires fewer workers. 
Other workers can focus on other responsibilities.
•	 Integration of Existing Systems: The ubiquitous manufacturing system is not an 
island. It comes from the integration of existing systems and other emerging 
technologies such as cloud manufacturing and additive manufacturing.
•	 Customization: Ubiquitous manufacturing supports mass customization through 
interchangeable parts and configurations. This is enabled by having the informa­
tion of customization travel with the product in the manufacturing phase. When 
information about the customization is carried in, it is also easy to track the cus­
tom orders.

15.9  Challenges
Although ubiquitous manufacturing is a reality today, we are still wrestling with the 
challenges. As more devices are being equipped with wireless communication inter­
faces, the frequency bands allocated for this purpose will soon be exhausted. Many 
UM applications will only be successful when they are based on vendor-­independent 
open standards [2]. One challenge is to determine which kind of real-time informa­
tion should be provided for adaptive decision-making and how to deliver the infor­
mation with existing information technologies [29]. The selection of appropriate 
cloud services for big data analytics is also a challenge [34]. Obviously, the longer 
it takes to manufacture a product, the more expensive it is. Other main challenges of 
ubiquitous manufacturing can be summarized as follows [25, 35]:
•	 Security: Today we are a data security-conscious society. Ubiquitous manufac­
turing is a model that is heavily information or data oriented. The privacy and the 
security of manufacturing data are also issues to be addressed. Manufacturers

often put cost and time-to-market ahead of ensuring they comply with security 
best practices. Users, enterprises, and governments are increasingly concerned 
about privacy. Deployments that rely on ubiquitous connectivity can face signifi­
cant challenges since unintended consequences of ubiquitous connectivity occur 
on a daily basis. Hackers present security problems as they target anything con­
nected to the web. Ensuring security implies protecting individual system com­
ponents against external attack and safeguarding the data transferred during 
communication procedures.
•	 Heterogeneous Systems: The robotic components of the ubiquitous robotic sys­
tems are highly heterogeneous with respect to platforms such as operating sys­
tem, programming language, and communication media. People are faced with 
the reality of users that are increasingly mobile and need access to multiple, 
heterogeneous devices at different times and locations.
•	 Complex Operations: It is a big challenge to develop big data-based UM applica­
tion systems to deal with the high volume, heterogeneous data produced by com­
plex manufacturing operations. The manufacturing problems are often in large 
size with uncertainties.
•	 Problems with RFID: Challenges still exist in applying RFID technologies to 
real-life UM environment. It is both labor and skill intensive to integrate and 
manage various kinds of RFID devices for various industrial applications. 
Requirement changes of applications is a challenge for RFID system in the man­
ufacturing environment [36].
•	 Lack of Awareness: Manufacturers are unaware of how ubiquitous manufactur­
ing can benefit them. As a result of this lack of awareness in the industrial com­
munity, most manufacturers are reluctant to adopt ubiquitous manufacturing.
•	 Expensive Maintenance: The continuous maintenance of ubiquitous facility 
(leading to automation and virtualization) is expensive. Ubiquitous devices 
installed in several places are delicate and subject to damage due to industrial 
heat, moisture, dust, physical impacts, etc. Their damage can cause business 
downtime, which makes adopting ubiquitous manufacturing difficult for manu­
facturers to accept.
•	 Lack of Standard: The absence of industry standards is another major challenge 
of UM. In the manufacturing environment, la ack of standardization represents a 
big risk. This is why standards (e.g., for data exchange protocols) are necessary. 
Ubiquitous technologies are embedded into everyday things that vary greatly 
from each other. This means that in terms of standardization, implementing ubiq­
uitous computing concepts into manufacturing should be much easier than into 
customer goods.

15.10  Global Ubiquitous Manufacturing
The name “ubiquitous manufacture” carries the idea that one could control a whole 
manufacturing and retailing chain from anywhere in the world and at any time. The 
objective is to implement technically a new way to do business. The technology 
developed during the project addresses several of globalized companies. Several 
software solutions exist, but they still bare crucial limitations and do not support 
manufacturing processes in a broader sense. We now consider how ubiquitous man­
ufacturing is applied in some nations.
•	 United States: A US company Baker Tilly has implemented services to connect 
and automate manufacturers’ production. NEST (which is now owned by 
Google) includes everything from automatic energy and use regulation when on 
holiday to handy temperature scheduling systems. It is easy to see why the popu­
larity of ubiquitous devices is on the rise. Intel designed a more geographically 
diversified, sustainable, and secure semiconductor supply chain. This investment 
will create jobs, foster innovation projects, and reposition the United States as a 
technology and manufacturing leader [37].
15  Ubiquitous Manufacturing

229
•	 Korea: ACS (Advanced Consulting Services), a Korean company based in 
Seoul’s digital city, was the first high-tech complex in the world for digital tech­
nologies, which put theories into practice. In 1988, ACS was the first to imple­
ment a manufacturing software designed for global operation in South Korea. 
Since then, Korea became the innovation hub. The Korean touch Cha likes to 
demonstrate on a board having pride of place in his office the functioning of the 
modern global company: “with our technology you can easily coordinate design 
in Korea, production in Brazil, planning in the USA, maintenance in France and 
recycling in China for a product actually distributed and sold in Germany” [17].
•	 Japan: Fujitsu Limited is the leading Japanese information and communication 
technology (ICT) company, offering a full range of technology products, solu­
tions, and services. It has been pushing ahead with company-wide initiatives on 
many fronts, from the cloud, platforms, and networks to front-end devices. In 
2015, Fujitsu announced that it would strengthen its Ubiquitous Solutions busi­
ness. The objective is to develop competitively, produce superior products, and 
expand its business. This will enable the company to provide the market with 
even more competitive and timely new products [38].
•	 Europe: The manufacturing sector in Europe must respond to demands for low 
and variable volumes of high quality, at low cost (in terms of time, energy, space, 
and price). This is of particular relevance to the aerospace sector. Such produc­
tion systems must deal with the challenge of increasing demand and regulation. 
The key challenge is then the transformation of manufacturing systems into 
dynamic facilities that can self-learn, self-adapt, and self-reconfigure [39].
15.11  Future of Ubiquitous Manufacturing
Today’s manufacturing will surely not be the manufacturing of tomorrow, as it may 
be too rigid to adjust to the demands of a globalized market. In the factory of the 
future, all the pieces, tools, objects, and people know where to be and when.
There are several manufacturing paradigms competing for the future, and it is too 
early to predict which one will succeed. Ubiquitous manufacturing is one of the 
emerging production models toward which manufacturing companies are evolving. 
Ubiquitous manufacturing technologies have been widely deployed in a variety of 
manufacturing processes. The trend is to integrate logistics planning with the UM 
task scheduling using big data analytics of the manufacturing data. We are gradually 
evolving from hierarchical to decentralized decision-making. This evolution in turn 
will provide new opportunities.
15.11  Future of Ubiquitous Manufacturing

15.12  Conclusion
Manufacturing activities have evolved over the years. With the convergence of wire­
less technologies, advanced electronics, and computer networks such as the Internet, 
the scope of manufacturing has expanded beyond geographical boundaries. 
Ubiquitous manufacturing basically means the usage of ubiquitous computing con­
cepts and technologies in manufacturing. It implies product design, manufacturing, 
and recycling via ubiquitous computing technology. It introduces changes to the 
factors and elements of traditional manufacturing systems and incorporates the cur­
rent requirements of smart systems.
Ubiquitous manufacturing is a manufacturing paradigm which is characterized 
by “design, makes, and sell product anywhere and at any time.” Since UM involves 
the whole lifecycle of a product, it should involve the collaboration of government, 
R&D centers, and enterprises. Government handles legislation, while R&D centers 
conduct research and development, and the enterprises invest in the technologies. 
More information about UM can be found in the book in [40].

Offshore Manufacturing
16.1  Introduction
Manufacturing refers to any business practice that transforms raw materials into 
finished or semifinished goods. The manufacturing industry is the major contributor 
to any nation’s economy. The globalization of manufacturing is well established in 
many industries. It is changing the nature of international trade. The global ever-­
increasing competition and fast technological change lead companies to combine 
their resources with those available in other countries. However, there has been a 
negative reaction to globalization based on the US manufacturing employment 
decline. Many multinational enterprises in the United States experienced job losses. 
Increasing global competition and profit-maximizing objectives has led many firms 
to expand to offshore jurisdictions. Offshoring (or offshore outsourcing) refers to 
relocating any business process abroad and then selling the goods in the company’s 
home country.
Offshoring manufacturing takes place when production operations are performed 
in another country, including manufacturing and product assembly, from one coun­
try to a low-cost country. It is considered an option when a company wants to reduce 
operating expenses while maintaining high-quality and sometimes compromised-­
quality products. The concept of offshoring is a business practice that has gained 
momentum and has become a widespread business practice among companies 
worldwide [1].
The counterintuitive and definitely questionable major business principle behind 
offshoring is that it is not better to be sending goods 2 km away than shipping them 
2,000 km across political boundaries in 24 days. Keeping plants near customers 
shortens lead time. Experience shows that many offshore manufacturers tend to 
overestimate profit and overlook problems such as currency exchange rate and polit­
ical instability of the offshore locations [2].
Do what you do best and outsource the rest.

This chapter provides an introduction to offshore manufacturing. It begins by 
explaining what offshore manufacturing is all about. It compares local/domestic 
manufacturing with offshore/foreign manufacturing. It also compares offshoring 
and outsourcing. It addresses offshore locations such as China, Mexica, and India. 
It highlights the benefits and challenges of offshore manufacturing. The last section 
concludes with comments.
16.2  What Is Offshore Manufacturing?
Offshore manufacturing (OM) (also known as offshore outsourcing or production 
offshoring) involves the relocation of manufacturing facilities and processes over­
seas in a country where labor and/or raw materials are cheaper. Offshore manufac­
turing is part of the umbrella term “offshoring,” which means the relocation abroad 
of any business process or operation in a foreign country, usually with the strategic 
intent of a tax haven. Conventional wisdom has it that companies go offshore to 
reduce costs, usually to low-wage countries. Factors that dictate offshoring can be 
technological, economic, geopolitical, cultural, psychosocial, regulatory, strategic, 
or an array of other influencing factors [3].

There are four basic types of offshore outsourcing [7]: (1) information technol­
ogy outsourcing, (2) business process outsourcing, (3) offshore software develop­
ment, and (4) knowledge process outsourcing. Services such as call centers, 
computer programming, reading medical data such as X-rays and magnetic reso­
nance imaging, medical transcription, income tax preparation, title searching, and 
software, electronic, and pharmaceutical intellectual property are being offshored.
Offshore manufacturing is essentially relocating the production of goods to 
another country. It means relocating manufacturing abroad and then selling the 
goods in the company’s home country. The driving factors behind offshoring include 
the following [8, 9]:
•	 Cost Savings: The primary motivating factor for companies to move their pro­
duction offshore is to save money. Offshoring is regarded as an opportunity to 
reduce total transaction costs and production costs. The ultimate goal is to help 
your customers remain extremely competitive. Your competitors may not have 
facilities overseas and thus may have higher costs.
•	 Competitive Concerns: To be competitive on the global stage, corporations need 
globally competitive prices. Offshore manufacturing can allow companies to 
remain competitive in an ever-changing market. Organization flexibility in man­
ufacturing is increasingly critical for companies to remain competitive in the 
marketplace. Offshore enhances international competitiveness so as to reduce 
costs, expand globally, serve customers more effectively, free up scarce resources, 
and leverage capabilities of foreign partners [10].
•	 High-Volume Manufacturing: Production volume is key. Offshore production 
facilities are often designed to support high-volume production. This can be 
16.2  What Is Offshore Manufacturing?

236
attributed to the fact that overseas manufacturing is less expensive than domestic 
production.
•	 Lower Labor Costs: Cheap labor is almost synonymous to offshore manufactur­
ing. Offshoring allows you to reduce labor cost, which is one of the most expen­
sive parts of your business. Overseas labor is only a fraction of the cost of 
domestic facilities labor operational costs. Businesses with more labor-intensive 
products are bound to see the biggest return on investment. Although low labor 
costs are often the primary reason for companies to look abroad, a company must 
be able to think beyond labor costs.
•	 Contract Manufacturing: A contract manufacturer is a manufacturer that con­
tracts with a company for products. It is one form of outsourcing. The contract 
manufacturer has full responsibility for component manufacturing or complete 
assembly of finished products. In this type of configuration, the company estab­
lishes the requirements that the contract manufacturer must meet in relation to 
quality of the products, packaging specifications, the lead time, and the delivery 
schedule. Today, contract manufacturing is embraced by multinationals like 
IBM, Philips, Lucent, Texas Instrument, and Ericson. Questions to ask in deter­
mining the value a contract manufacturer can deliver in this area include [11]:
–– What regulatory bodies does the contract manufacturer work with most 
frequently?
–– What resources does the contract manufacturer have dedicated to quality 
management and compliance activities?
–– Is there a well-defined process for transfer of work?
–– How does the contract manufacturer address tooling compatibility issues?
–– Can the contract manufacturer’s engineering team support product redesign 
for cost reduction or added functionality?
–– Does the contract manufacturer have the support staff and processes in place 
to support product qualification and production validation processes?
–– Does the contract manufacturer’s team look at business issues such optimum 
logistics strategy?
These terms are also used to describe offshoring manufacturing.
Various industries including automotive, computer, food manufacturing, aero­
space, packaging, financial services, telecommunications, and others utilize off­
shore manufacturing to increase production while lowering costs. For example, 
BMW, a German car manufacturer, may relocate a BMW factory in the United 
States in order to easily reach the American auto industry. British pharmaceutical 
company AstraZeneca (AZ) has production facilities in China and produces goods 
for Chinese consumers. American carmaker Ford has factories in Mexico with 
Americans consuming most of the cars. Japanese multinational enterprises have 
steadily increased their offshore manufacturing presence.

16.3  Local or Offshore Manufacturing
The choice between domestic/local and offshore/foreign manufacturing is some­
times not easy. In order to make a clear and informed decision, it is important to 
know the pros and cons for both. While local manufacturing is more accommodat­
ing to smaller quantity, offshore manufacturing is generally about large quantity 
production. Although the price from an offshore manufacturing organization is 
lower than its local counterpart, it is important to factor in some high costs such as 
transportation costs [12].
When designing a new product, a business must decide whether to work with a 
domestic manufacturer or outsource the production overseas. It is not always true 
that local manufacturing is more expensive than outsourcing production overseas. 
The perception that offshore manufacturing is cheaper may not take into account 
hidden costs such as shipping, tariffs, and taxes. For inventors that want to manufac­
ture products on a small scale, there may be no cost benefits when they outsource 
this process offshore. For example, demand for computers, cell phones, accessories, 
and the related devices make them prime candidates for nearby sourcing. Local 
manufacturers have the following advantages [13]:
•	 Localizing supply chains
•	 Greater supply chain stability
•	 High-quality assurance
•	 Less waste
•	 Fair working conditions
•	 Adherence to strict safety standards
•	 Keeps intellectual property closer to home
•	 Reduced shipping costs
•	 The “Made in the USA” label does sell products
•	 Makes communication much easier
•	 Offers greater flexibility
If you are a manufacturer and local manufacturing is expensive, to remain com­
petitive, then you may consider offshore manufacturing.
Some companies outsource certain components, parts, and processes that are not 
among their core competencies. They outsource as a strategy to strengthen their 
competitive advantage. Other specific reasons companies offshore their manufac­
turing include [14]:
•	 Shortage of Skills: A shortage of employees with the required skills is one of the 
main reasons why they offshore some of their manufacturing processes. 
Offshoring maximizes the efficiency of operations and boosts business 
productivity.
•	 Cost-savings: Factories offshore their production overseas to access lower man­
ufacturing costs. It is estimated that companies can save up to 80% in cost 
savings.
16.3  Local or Offshore Manufacturing

238
•	 Efficient Quality and Process: Offshoring destinations in Asia are efficient in 
setting up systems that conform to standard rules and procedures.
•	 Time zone coverage: Companies can cover time zones not handled by their oper­
ations through subsidiaries or offshore service providers in countries offering 
24/7 operations.
One must understand that offshore manufacturing is not all roses and labor sav­
ings. It may be faster, convenient, and cheaper to do business with a company that 
is just around the corner than one located halfway around the globe. It may be wise 
to outsource in the United States. Keep in mind that other cultures have different 
customs, but people are friendly just like everywhere else. Some cogent reasons not 
to consider offshore manufacturing include [15, 16]:
•	 Not the Only Option: Many American manufacturers claim that going offshore is 
their only alternative if they are to survive and stay competitive in the global 
market. They insist it is either offshore manufacturing or no manufacturing at all. 
However, this blatant argument may not seem to go far in face of several disad­
vantages or challenge facing offshore manufacturing. For example, more 
Japanese automakers and electronics companies are building manufacturing 
plants in the United States when many American companies are claiming it is 
impossible for them to stay home and be competitive. Japanese factories are 
competitive and successful because of their excellent manufacturing techniques 
management philosophy.
•	 Loss of Intellectual Property: Intellectual property (IP) is always an issue because 
businesses which offshore are bound to expose some of their IP to suppliers. 
Making the shift to offshore production might leave critical company secrets 
vulnerable and lead to the theft of intellectual property. IP theft has become an 
issue due to the exposure. US companies that transfer technology across national 
borders do not have the same protection against piracy they enjoy at home. IP 
theft has become an issue. China is well-known for its poor enforcement of intel­
lectual property laws, and there is a serious risk of copycat products. Korea 
denies copyright protection to software, semiconductors, or foreign works.

•	 Do Not Really Save Much: Because labor is cheap, the Chinese have little incen­
tive to improve process efficiency. Consequently, lean manufacturing is a more 
difficult process to implement in China than in the United States. There is the 
possibility of suffering great loss due to hidden costs in such areas as are impacted 
by cultural and political differences, warranties, and privacy issues.
•	 Collaborators May Become Competitors: Distance may make collaboration very 
challenging. The danger that collaboration will give way to competition is real.
•	 Foreign Exchange: Manufacturing abroad usually involves dealing with a differ­
ent, foreign currency which may be fluctuating and may not favor the home busi­
ness. Currency volatility and wage-rate inflation occur in the low wage country. 
This implies that the low wage jurisdiction will not be low wage forever.
16.4  Offshoring and Outsourcing
The rapid growth of offshoring and outsourcing has transformed the way businesses 
have managed their operations globally. There is often some misconceptions about 
the difference between offshoring and outsourcing. The two terms have been used 
interchangeably because they share some characteristics, yet they refer to different 
firm strategies and they can be combined. They are interrelated. Other related terms 
include onshoring, reshoring, inshoring, insourcing, backshoring, bestshoring or 
rightshoring, and nearshoring [7]. There are several factors that determine the extent 
of outsourcing and offshoring.
Outsourcing is an “umbrella” term. Offshoring takes place when you relocate the 
work to a different country and is a form of outsourcing. Offshoring moves produc­
tion operations to another country, but the company remains in complete control of 
all aspects of the operation. Offshoring is always outsourcing, but not all outsourc­
ing is offshore.
16.3
6
The term “outsourcing” means contracting out a portion of the business activity 
to an external party rather than doing it in-house [18]. Outsourcing manufacturing 
lets you scale up production to meet demand without a major investment. Lower 
cost and increased corporate profitability are often the major motivations. Things 
like customer satisfaction, product education, delays in time to market, overseas 
communication, the target country’s level of economic development and political 
stability, project management, adjustment cost, transportation and logistics, cultural 
sensitivities, and language differences are just a few of the long-term hidden costs 
for outsourcing.
It is expedient for a manufacturer to outsource part of the manufacturing process 
to third parties, especially when it does not have the equipment required to fabricate 
16.4  Offshoring and Outsourcing

240
certain components. Outsourcing is a prominent feature of many recent models of 
international trade. Outsourcing is an effective means by which a company can 
reduce overhead costs and increase profits. Outsourcing allows companies to mainly 
focus on sales and marketing, while entrusting a firm to handle production, quality 
control, and administration. Outsourcing increases efficiency and allows a company 
to accomplish the same task for less money [19]. For example, some companies 
outsource various professional services such as emailing, payroll, and call center.
A simpler and more effective outsourcing alternative is onshoring. Onshoring 
offers improved communication and increased productivity between both parties. 
For example, a company located in New York City can contract services to a com­
pany located in smaller city like Huntsville, Alabama, where living expenses are 
much lower.
In 1986, United Technologies closed its diesel-engine parts plant in Springfield, 
Massachusetts, and transferred operations to a plant in South Carolina and two 
plants in Europe. By working with a company located in the same country, both 
parties will benefit from more convenient time zones, faster and cheaper business 
travel, and easier collaboration. Onshoring eliminates the need to look overseas for 
quality software development outsourcing and keeps jobs in the United States. It 
also eliminates the problems of data security, political instability, time zones, dis­
tance, language barriers, etc. [20].
16.5  Offshore Locations
When considering offshore manufacturing, a first step is to determine the best coun­
try for the location of the offshore manufacturing. Common locations for offshoring 
include China, Vietnam, India, Brazil, Turkey, Malaysia, Taiwan, the Philippines, 
Pakistan, and other countries. US-based companies often consider China and 
Mexico as the widely utilized locations for offshoring manufacturing operations. 
China is the largest offshoring destination for US-based companies. Mexico may be 
a better option due to the close proximity of Mexico to the United States. Duties 
may be considered depending upon the governing tariff code. Shipping time, age, 
and availability of the labor force are important factors to think about [7]. Countries 
like China and India have become major sources of some services due to perceived 
lower costs stemming from cheap labor and production. Due to space limitation, we 
will consider three main countries where US companies make offshoring [21]:

•	 Mexico: Mexico has a privileged geographical position with cheap labor. Besides 
labor being the primary cost savings in Mexico, the demographics of the country 
make it an ideal choice for US-based companies. The introduction of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has made it easier for American man­
ufacturers to relocate to Mexico. A maquiladora was an assembly plant operated 
in Mexico under a preferential tariff program. It originated as part of the Mexican 
government’s 1965 Border Industrialization Program, which targeted to stimu­
late the manufacturing sectors of depressed economies.
•	 India: India is a leader in relocation services and administrative processes. It has 
the advantages of English proficiency and a large number of skilled workforces 
especially in computer engineering. India’s education system is mainly focused 
on higher education. State and central governments in India have offered compa­
nies financial incentives to attract foreign investors. Today, India is the prime 
location for offshoring IT operations such as code maintenance, help desk, and 
desktop maintenance. India’s software outsourcers have attracted billions of dol­
lars of US foreign direct investment. India is considered number one for develop­
ing drugs that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The main 
challenge a company may face in India is cultural differences.
Besides the locations for offshoring manufacturing operations, important factors 
a company must consider include the wage rate of workers and whether the work­
force can maintain the quality of the product.

16.6  Benefits of Offshoring
When it comes to international investment, offshoring is becoming the trend. This 
business practice offers a reduction of costs for the company and an increased qual­
ity in products. Offshore manufacturing can be a real boon. It provides convenience, 
cost savings, high volume production, global presence, and international markets. 
Other benefits of offshoring include [23]:
•	 Lower labor costs: Offshore manufacturing labor costs have historically been 
lower than domestic labor costs. Foreign workers benefit from new jobs and 
higher wages when the work moves to the country.
•	 Less expensive raw materials: Raw materials often cost less when the manufac­
turer is close to their source.
•	 Easier access to specialized suppliers: Manufacturing countries such as Asia 
often have a larger number of specialized suppliers.
•	 More time to focus on product development: You can focus on product develop­
ment and the manufacturing of your company’s niche products.
•	 Eliminates operational concerns: OM represents a net gain and reduces opera­
tional headaches.
•	 Economic development: OM is one of the main reasons for the economic devel­
opment of the developing countries like China. It leads to economic growth of 
many developing countries, which has led to currency.
•	 Local Representatives: Having local representatives available in China, India, 
Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, or Thailand to advocate for your company is criti­
cal in maintaining product quality, effective communication, and surveillance of 
offshore manufacturing site.

16.7  Challenges of Offshoring
Offshore manufacturing could be a profitable experience. However, some compa­
nies experience huge challenges, frustrations, and disappointments that lead to 
financial loss. When sourcing offshore manufacturing, stresses about quality dete­
rioration, unreliable delivery, world economy, fluctuating exchange rates, political 
instability, and untrustworthy suppliers can be major issues to worry about. The 
rapid growth of offshoring has sparked a contentious debate over its impact on the 
US manufacturing industry partly due to the steep employment declines and numer­
ous plant closures. Most companies made the decision to offshore based on miscal­
culations and high expectations. Offshoring often demands much more time, more 
management oversight, and a more nuanced approach than most companies realize. 
Other challenges of offshoring include [20, 24, 25]:
16  Offshore Manufacturing

243
 
•	 Risks Involved: There are risks associated with offshore manufacturing. OM 
incur risks that have to with quality issues, shipping costs, duties, currency reval­
uations, and delays in time to market. A wide range of factors exist that may 
potentially affect quality and risk in offshore manufacturing. For example, a 
company can lose time, money, and reputation as it engages the practice of off­
shore manufacturing.
•	 Quality Suffers: Quality becomes an issue comparing onshore/nearshore and off­
shore manufacturing. Quality concerns can cause some rethinking about what 
goes offshore and what stays home. There is a wide range of factors that can 
affect quality in OM. Overseas suppliers may use inferior components.
•	 Lack of Support: US and state governments do not offer a lot of support for off­
shore manufacturing.
•	 Job Loss: OM is often blamed for job loss. Some believe that OM moves jobs to 
another country, thereby increasing unemployment in the home country. Ordinary 
citizens may be adversely affected by unregulated, offshore activities. Jobs are 
added in the destination country and are subtracted from the higher-cost labor 
country. In other words, there is job loss in the origin/home country and job gain 
in the destination country.
16.7  Challenges of Offshoring

244
•	 Time Zone Difference: A major challenge of offshoring is time zone differences. 
Many offshoring companies operate within a 5–12 hour difference from 
their client.
•	 Language Barrier: When working with someone in another country who natively 
speaks another language, this can make communication and collaboration a 
major challenge. Language barriers and cultural differences add to the complexity.
•	 Intellectual Property Concerns: The security of your intellectual property can be 
a major concern. Protecting your intellectual property (IP) may be important 
than reducing your manufacturing costs.
•	 Data Security: This is an important factor for offshoring. It entails giving access 
to some classified customer data and information to offshore manufacturers. Any 
breach in data security could heavily impact your business and customers.
Other challenges include cultural and social differences, geopolitical uncertainty, 
and counterfeiters. As manufacturing costs in low-cost countries have increased, it 
becomes questionable whether it makes sense to offshore production. There are still 
many good reasons for US companies to continue to offshore manufacturing in Asia.
16.8  Conclusion
Globalization has made offshoring a predominant business practice in many large 
companies, and offshoring has become an irreversible trend. Offshoring is the 
movement of a business process from one country to a lower-cost country or one 
with fewer regulatory restrictions. It allows companies today to collaborate simulta­
neously with multiple partners across the globe. Manufacturers in the United States 
and Europe can make sense of offshore manufacturing. Offshoring can increase a 
company’s domestic employment. When deciding whether to build new plants here 
or offshoring, offshoring may present a higher or a lower risk depending on a variety 
of important factors tied to strategic business decisions. Businesses benefit from 
accessibility to labor resources across the world. The types of products best suited 
for offshoring are products with high labor content. The common products that are 
manufactured offshore include car parts, electronics, furniture, petroleum, etc. 
Although it is still viable for US companies to source and manufacture in Asia, more 
careful cost-benefit analysis is required to arrive at a robust and wise business deci­
sion that delivers sustained business advantage in the long term.
To prepare the workforce, colleges need to adapt and provide graduates who 
have some educational background in offshore manufacturing. Some engineering 
programs are realizing the importance of international experience and incorporating 
offshore manufacturing in their programs [26]. Offshore manufacturing is here to 
stay, but it is not for everyone [27]. More information about offshore manufacturing 
can be found in the books in [28–34] and related journal: Strategic Outsourcing: An 
International Journal.

Cyber Manufacturing
17.1  Introduction
Manufacturing embodies the process of creating a product out of raw materials. The 
manufacturing industry includes many sectors such as the food industry, chemical 
industry, automotive industry, aerospace industry, metal machinery industry, and 
electronics industry, to name a few. Manufacturing has been noted as one of the 
largest industries globally [1]. Manufacturing is a national priority in many nations, 
both in developed and developing nations. They are investing heavily in strategic, 
manufacturing-technology areas.
In the past, the manufacturing industry had been in a continuous struggle to pro­
duce high-quality goods at the reasonable price that consumers can afford. The 
industrial era has allowed machines to resolve the quantity issue of manufacturing. 
Many existing manufacturing systems were developed at a time when security was 
not an issue. Today’s manufacturing operations integrate resources in a more com­
plex manner, which requires extensive collaboration and security. Data (or informa­
tion) is the biggest asset of a company, because it is how value is stored. This makes 
the security of the data to be a necessity.
Cybersecurity is one of the major hurdles in implementing a cyber manufactur­
ing system (CMS), since CMS opens a door for cyber-physical attacks on manufac­
turing systems. Cyber manufacturing is a modern manufacturing approach that 
utilizes cyber-physical systems, which are smart systems that include co-engineered 
interacting networks of physical and computational components [2]. A cyber-­
physical system (CPS) is usually connected via the Internet. CPSs are essentially 
integrations of computation, networking, and physical processes. They are increas­
ingly finding applications in manufacturing.
This chapter provides an introduction to cyber manufacturing. It begins by 
explaining what cyber manufacturing is all about. It describes enabling technologies 
Cybersecurity is a subject that requires logic, knowledge, 
thought, and commitment. It can be applied or research based. 
It is a true leveler for all to enter, be successful and lead the 
future of cybersecurity.

needed in developing cyber manufacturing solutions. It presents common cyberat­
tacks on manufacturing. It suggests some strategies for handling cybersecurity risks 
in manufacturing. It highlights some benefits and challenges of cyber manufactur­
ing. It covers global cyber manufacturing. The last section concludes with comments.
17.2  What Is Cyber Manufacturing
The concept of “cyber manufacturing” is derived from cyber-physical systems. 
Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are engineered systems that are designed to interact 
seamlessly with networks of physical and computational components. They are 
integrations of computation, networking, and physical processes. They may be 
regarded as systems of collaborating computational elements that control physical 
entities, generally using feedback from sensors they monitor. They are complex 
systems with the integration of computation, communication, and control (3C) tech­
nology. They have made great strides in manufacturing systems. Common examples 
of CPS include automobiles, medical devices, and the smart grid (or power sys­
tems). Most CPS become safety-critical and security-critical.
Cyber manufacturing may be regarded as the convergence of cyber-physical sys­
tems (CPSs), systems engineering, and manufacturing innovation. CPSs are 
enabling technologies that bring the virtual and physical worlds together to create a 
truly networked world in which intelligent objects communicate and interact with­
out human intervention. They are essentially the upgraded version of embedded 
systems. They are the heart of Industry 4.0. They are expected to bring about radical 
changes and revolution in the interaction between the physical and virtual worlds [3].
Cyber manufacturing is a new transformative concept that involves the transla­
tion of data from interconnected systems into predictive and prescriptive operations. 
This concept applies advancements in information technology to the manufacturing 
process. Expected functionalities of cyber manufacturing systems include machine 
connectivity and data acquisition and manufacturing reconfigurability.

As manufacturing becomes more digitized, it is becoming a popular target for 
cybercriminals, and manufacturing plant cybersecurity has become a hot issue. 
Manufacturers are often the target of cyberattacks because of their valuable data, 
positive value proposition, intellectual property (IP) assets, and trade secrets. They 
are increasingly vulnerable to attacks that can shut down production regardless of 
their size. Therefore, cybersecurity issues are gaining importance in the manufac­
turing industry. Cybersecurity is therefore concerned with a set of principles and 
means of ensuring the security of data. The stakes are high, and manufacturers 
should do everything possible in their power to alleviate the risks. Manufacturers 
must find ways to prevent attempts to corrupt their data, steal intellectual property, 
and sabotage their operation [5].

17.3  Enabling Technologies
Several technologies are needed in developing cyber manufacturing solutions. The 
enabling technologies include cyber-physical systems (CPSs), Internet of Things 
(IoT), cloud computing, digital twin, sensors network, and machine learning.
•	 Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is the key foundation of cyber manufacturing.
•	 CPS usually refers to systems of collaborating computational elements that con­
trol physical entities. CPSs are based on connectivity but run complex analytics. 
They combine physical components and digital networks to change how manu­
facturing companies automate processes and information sharing.

objects (sensors, machines, cars, buildings, etc.) that allows interaction and 
cooperation of these objects to reach a common objective. Wireless sensor net­
works (WSNs) are a key enabling technology for IoT in manufacturing. While 
the IoT paradigm does not include the idea of information analytics, CPS is 
based on connectivity and runs complex analytics. However, it is possible to 
view the IoT as the infrastructure that makes CPS possible. By increasing the 
amount of automation at multiple levels within a factory and across the enter­
prise, cyber-physical manufacturing systems enable higher productivity, higher 
quality, and lower costs. The real value of the IoT for manufacturers will be in 
the analytics arising from CPSs. Characteristically, IoT will make everything in 
our lives “smart.” IoT has the potential to accurately track people, equipment, or 
even service animals and analyze the data captured [7].
•	 Big Data Analytics: The volume of data has exploded to unimaginable levels in 
the past decade. Big data comes from different sources such as sensors, devices, 
computer networks, machines, IoT, GPS, RFID, e-commerce transactions, web, 
weather data, medical data, insurance records, and social media. As we capture 
terabytes of data, our major challenge is making sense of this gigantic amount of 
data. This is where big data analytics fits into the picture. Big data analytics deals 
with examining massive amounts of data to uncover hidden patterns, market 
trends, customer preferences, and other useful information that can help in mak­
ing informed decisions. The massive amount of raw data available from the man­

ufacturing process creates opportunities to add intelligence to the process. Cyber 
manufacturing intertwines industrial big data and smart analytics to discover and 
comprehend invisible issues for decision-making. Big data analytics is a technol­
ogy that aims to support manufacturers to extract knowledge from data, which 
can be used for future prediction, increasing profits, and enhancing customer 
service [8, 9].
17.4  Attack on Cyber Manufacturing
Cyberattacks in manufacturing industries are on the rise. Manufacturing remains 
one of the top sectors when it comes to targeted cyberattacks. The manufacturing 
industry is the fourth most vulnerable to cyberattacks, behind healthcare, govern­
ment systems, and financial services. Automotive manufacturers are the top targets 
for criminals. Manufacturers are increasingly being targeted by traditional mali­
cious actors such as hackers and cyber-criminals and by competing companies and 
nations engaged in corporate espionage. Motivations range from money and revenge 
to competitive advantage and strategic disruption. Manufacturing equipment have 
increasing vulnerabilities over the years.
It is important for businesses to be aware of some of the most common types of 
manufacturing cyberattacks so that you can take the necessary steps to protect your 
company. Types of cyberattacks in manufacturing vary from the illegal crime of an 
individual citizen (hacking) to the actions of groups (terrorists). The common 
attacks include the following [10–13].
•	 Identity theft: This is the most commonly reported form of cyberattacks. This 
kind of attack can either target the customer data or the data of employees. In 
manufacturing, there are countless incidents of malicious insiders stealing a 
company’s intellectual property or other confidential information for personal 
profit or revenge. Intellectual property (IP) is the manufacturing industry’s key 
asset and prized possession. The company’s valuable IP can be stolen by a com­
peting executive, causing significant reputational and financial damage to the 
company and loss in global operations. If a hacker can steal one-of-a-kind intel­
lectual property, the hacker can sell the information for a premium.
•	 Malware: This is a malicious software or code that includes traditional computer 
viruses, computer worms, and Trojan horse programs. Malware can infiltrate 
your network through the Internet, downloads, attachments, email, social media, 
and other platforms. Spyware is a type of malware that collects information with­
out the victim’s knowledge. Advanced malware is another type of attack that is 
increasingly common in manufacturing. Internal threats can be just as damaging. 
To protect against malware, manufacturers can take the following steps:
–– File encryption.
–– Implement two-step verification.
17.4  Attack on Cyber Manufacturing

252
–– Install antivirus software on computers.
–– Mandate encryption of data transmissions.
–– Update operating systems, browsers, and plugins.
–– Safeguard usernames and passwords.
–– Secure Internet connections with firewalls.
•	 Ransomware: A ransomware attack locks users out of their computer systems 
and only allows access until an exorbitant amount of money (the ransom) is paid. 
This is now a well-known threat to manufacturing. Ransomware is a type of 
malware that encrypts files on a network and makes them unusable until the 
demands of hackers are met. These threat actors may threaten to sell or leak sen­
sitive data if a ransom is not paid. Manufacturers have much to lose from ran­
somware because time is money for manufacturing companies.
•	 Phishing: This is a tactic where a criminal will seek out information and data on 
your business. Rather than stealing this, they will simply request the information. 
Phishing facilitates the process by tricking executives and their staff into reveal­
ing login credentials. A good example of a phishing scam is the “Nigerian Prince” 
who is ready to donate millions to you. All you need to do is provide your bank 
details and a copy of your passport. Criminals trick victims into handing over 
their personal information such as online passwords, social security number, and 
credit card numbers. Common warning signs of phishing include:
–– Attachments with dangerous file types
–– Immediate demands or requests
–– Lucrative offers with attention-grabbing statements
–– Misspelled hyperlinks of known websites
–– Unusual email sender(s)
–– Threats
•	 Denial-of-service attacks: These are designed to make a network resource 
unavailable to its intended users. These can prevent the user from accessing 
email, websites, online accounts, or other services. Manufacturing companies 
can fall victim to distributed denial of service (DDoS) style attacks. Recent 
research shows that manufacturing is the most targeted industry for DDoS.
•	 Social Engineering Attacks: A cybercriminal attempts to trick users to disclose 
sensitive information. A social engineer aims to convince a user through imper­
sonation to disclose secrets such as passwords, card numbers, or social security 
number. A social engineer may send an e-mail saying, “Hey, this is vendor X, 
here’s our new bank account information; please re-route all payments here.”
•	 Man-In-the-Middle Attack: This is a cyberattack where a malicious attacker 
secretly inserts him/herself into a conversation between two parties who believe 
they are directly communicating with each other. A common example of 
­man-in-­the-middle attacks is eavesdropping. The goal of such an attack is to steal 
personal information.
Other cybersecurity threats that the manufacturing companies should be pre­
pared for include IoT attacks, supply chain attack, internal breaches, equipment 
17  Cyber Manufacturing

253
sabotage, and zero-day attacks. Cybersecurity involves reducing the risk of cyberat­
tacks. It involves the collection of tools, policies, guidelines, risk management 
approaches, and best practices that can be used to protect the cyber environment and 
mitigate cyberattacks. Cybercrime prevention is a multifaceted issue. Cyber risks 
should be managed proactively by the management.
17.5  Handling Cybersecurity Risks
Every manufacturer is potentially at risk. Manufacturers are a major target for state-­
sponsored espionage as well as opportunistic hackers. There are strategic steps 
every manufacturer can take to reduce the security breach risks for their business 
and their customers. Any manufacturer of any size can handle cybersecurity risks by 
following these five steps [14].
	1.	 Identify: Understand your resources and risks. Identify and control who has 
access to your business information. Manufacturers must “think outside of the 
box” to assess and identify cybersecurity threats. Effective cybersecurity is 
essentially knowing where the data lies.
	2.	 Protect: If you experience a cyberattack, you need to be prepared to resist. Make 
sure that the right security systems are in place. Guard against both targeted and 
untargeted attacks. Limit employee access to data and information. Enforce 
password rules requiring strong passwords and two-factor authentication when 
available. Train your employees so they can recognize a potential breach or 
attack. For some manufacturers, the biggest cyber threat is a lack of knowledge 
and training of the employees.
	3.	 Detect: If an attack occurs, you need mechanisms in place that will alert you as 
quickly as possible. Install and update your systems with the latest antivirus 
software. Also, update your cybersecurity plan from time to time.
	4.	 Respond: If a cybersecurity breach happens, you need to contain and reduce any 
damage. Stay updated on potential cyber threats.
	5.	 Recover: After a cybersecurity breach, you need mechanisms in place to help 
resume normal operations. Make full backups of important business data and 
information.

17.5  Handling Cybersecurity Risks

254

17.6  Benefits
Most manufacturing companies are behind in cybersecurity systems implementa­
tion. Some cyberattacks on manufacturing impact operations so severely that they 
can pause operations, close plants, precipitate companies reneging on customer 
orders, and cause companies to spend substantial sums to recover from the event. 
Strong cybersecurity is the foundation for a resilient manufacturing company. 
Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet to ensure complete security for manufactur­
ing companies. Food manufacturers always look for ways to prevent cyberattacks 
from keeping their businesses and the food products they produce safe for consumers.
Trends, such as the industrial Internet of Things and Industry 4.0, are driving 
organizations to facilitate more connections between the physical process world and 
the Internet. The risk to manufacturing organizations from cyberattacks has 
increased dramatically. However, there are strategies to mitigate risk and secure key 
assets. To be ready for the future, manufacturing companies must be prepared to act 
now. It is always expedient to follow a good old principle: hope for the best, plan for 
the worst. As IoT and CPS technologies advance, cyber manufacturing realization 
will be facilitated through standardization and more reliable cybersecurity.
17.7  Challenges
The applications of CPS in many domains such as manufacturing will have disrup­
tive effects on technology, business, law, and ethics. The increased use of CPS 
brings some threats that could have significant consequences for users. CPS are

prone to information leakage from the physical domain. They are prone to a wider 
range of attacks and design flaws [15].
Cyber-physical attacks are becoming common across a wide range of industries 
including manufacturing. Manufacturing is a significant target for cybercriminals, 
and manufacturers must take appropriate actions to protect themselves in the face of 
cyber-related risks. The attacks may cause physical damages to physical compo­
nents (such as machines, equipment, parts, products, etc.) through unintended over-­
wearing, breakage, and scrap parts. Cyber-physical attacks are new and unique risks 
to CMSs. The four most dangerous cyber risks are identity theft, compromised web­
sites, spam, and employees [16].
Although there is no mandated regulatory standards for governing cybersecurity 
in manufacturing, the cybersecurity communities have developed a variety of stan­
dards, which address weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Different standards contribute 
in different ways to realize cyber manufacturing. Developing standards tends to 
motivate the adoption of new technologies and accelerates the adoption of new 
manufactured products and manufacturing methods. Standards allow a more 
dynamic and competitive marketplace. They are a critical tool for leveling the play­
ing field for small businesses by reducing the cost barriers. They enable low-cost 
applications which are suitable for small manufacturers [17].
These challenges are critical to cyber manufacturers’ abilities to capture the 
value associated with this new frontier of technology while appropriately address­
ing the dynamic cyber risks. Many technologies, such as big data analytics, com­
munication protocols, and cybersecurity, still need a lot of research and development 
before cyber manufacturing can reach their full potential [18].
17.8  Global Cyber Manufacturing
In today’s business environment of increased automation, ubiquitous connectivity, 
and globalization, even the most powerful organizations in the world are vulnerable 
to debilitating cyber threats. As manufacturing around the world are implementing 
digital transformation to survive, grow, and drive smart factories, cybersecurity 
threats have become a major concern. The manufacturing industry is one of the 
most targeted sectors globally due to its vulnerability. US and European countries 
still can lead international manufacturing by exploiting cyber physical system (CPS) 
technologies such as wireless system integration, wireless controls, machine learn­
ing, and sensor-based manufacturing. We now consider how cyber manufacturing is 
being applied in some nations [19, 20].
•	 United States: The US House of Representatives approved three (3) bills that aim 
at strengthening cybersecurity measures in critical energy infrastructure. It also 
took concrete measures to bolster industrial control cybersecurity, strengthen US 
critical supply chains, and improve long-term economic security. The US 
Department of Energy (DOE) released the Cybersecurity Capability Maturity

Model to meet cyber threat challenges. The US Department of Justice has 
charged five (5) Chinese military officers with stealing trade secrets from manu­
facturers such as Westinghouse Electric, US Steel, Alcoa, and Allegheny 
Technologies. These moves demonstrate that US government agencies are taking 
the threat against the security of the cyber-physical systems very seriously.
•	 United Kingdom: Cyber threat has been the biggest risk for manufacturing in the 
United Kingdom. Most manufacturers have not received training to deal with 
cyberattacks and some are largely unprepared for the growing possibility of a 
cyberattack. Manufacturers, particularly hi-tech manufacturers, such as aero­
space, electronics, and pharmaceuticals, were a high-risk target. As the UK’s 
voice for manufacturing and engineering, European Energy Forum (EEF) has the 
potential to play a significant role in supporting manufacturers in the face of 
some challenges. Effective cybersecurity at both the national level, and for busi­
nesses, requires cooperation between the public and private sectors. The indi­
vidual forces are supported by the Regional Organized Crime Units (ROCUs).
•	 Germany: In 2014, a blast furnace at a German steel mill reportedly suffered 
“massive damage” after hackers used malware-laden emails to gain access to the 
unnamed steel mill’s automated control systems. While the exact details of the 
company involved are still unknown, the attacker used sophisticated social engi­
neering and phishing tactics to hack into the German steel mill’s computer net­
work. The attacker, likely an industry insider or someone working with an 
insider, had specific knowledge of the production processes involved so that 
maximum damage could be done.
17.9  Conclusion
In an era of ubiquitous connectivity when more and more industrial systems are 
connected to the Internet, manufacturing is a prime target for cyber criminals. As 
manufacturing increasingly becomes more digitized, cybersecurity must become a 
critical standard component of effective management in manufacturing. 
Cybersecurity is now becoming a dominant concern for manufacturers and consum­
ers. By increasing the level of automation within a factory, cyber-physical manufac­
turing systems enable higher productivity and higher quality at lower costs.
The most important part of any manufacturing operation is its people. To help in 
the attraction of cyber talent, manufacturers should work to become allies with 
higher educational institutions and build the talent pool they need. While attracting 
and retaining talented cyber professionals, manufacturers should provide training 
for the rest of the company’s employees. More information about cyber manufactur­
ing can be found in the books in [21, 22] and related journals: Manufacturing Letters 
and Journal of Manufacturing Systems

Biomanufacturing
18.1  Introduction
Manufacturing constitutes a significant portion of the economy of any nation and 
has a rich history. We are currently experiencing a major change in manufacturing, 
the means of production. The biomanufacturing revolution is changing the way we 
think of centralized systems, social equity, and our relationship with nature. It is 
becoming a change agent similar in scope to the Industrial Revolution [1].
Biomanufacturing (or biologics manufacturing) is the production of biological 
products from living cells. It may be regarded as the manufacturing component of 
the biotechnology industry. It is an emerging manufacturing process that utilizes 
biological systems to produce commercially important biomaterials and biomole­
cules. It is a highly complex process that requires much more time and expense than 
needed for small molecules. It is used in medicine, food industry, and industrial 
applications. Biomanufactured products range from biopharmaceuticals to indus­
trial enzymes, human tissues, and replacement organs. They are used across several 
industries such as food and beverage processing and for industrial applications.

This chapter introduces the reader to biomanufacturing. It begins by describing 
what biomanufacturing is all about. It provides some applications of biomanufactur­
ing. It highlights the benefits and challenges of biomanufacturing. It covers global 
biomanufacturing and the future of biomanufacturing. The last section concludes 
with comments.
I think the biggest innovations of the twenty-first century will be 
at the intersection of biology and technology. A new era is 
beginning.

18.2  What Is Biomanufacturing?

262
The most common methods of biomanufacturing useful cells include the fol­
lowing [7]:
•	 Blood Plasma Fractionation: This is the process of separating components of 
blood plasma, which are most commonly used in medicines to improve the 
immune system.
•	 Cell Culture: This is the process by which cells are grown in an artificial environ­
ment under controlled conditions. For example, animal and plant cells are repli­
cated and grown in a culture dish. This is beneficial for medicines, supplements, 
and enzymes.
•	 Column Chromatography: This method is used to purify chemical compounds 
from mixtures. For example, the method is used for pharmaceuticals and 
medicines.
•	 Fermentation: This is a metabolic process converting sugar into gases, acids, and 
alcohol. It is most important for the food and beverage industry as well as for 
industrial applications. Fermentation makes use of microorganisms and enzymes 
to carry out reactions. It is the source of some common products such as bread, 
beer, soaps, detergents, alcohol, and more.
•	 Homogenization: This is the process by which all fractions in a biological sample 
are equally made. This is useful in medicine and industrial applications to create 
a balance among cell constructions.
•	 Ultrafiltration: This process involves the separation of solids and solutes. Low 
molecular weight components pass through the semipermeable membrane. The 
process is used in drinking water, wastewater treatment, etc.
18.3  Applications
Biomanufacturing is used to produce commercially relevant biomaterials to be used 
in medicine, industrial applications, and the food and beverage industry.
•	 Medicine: Biomanufacturing uses biological systems including enzymes, micro­
organisms, cells, tissues, plants, and animals to fabricate commercial products 
for agricultural, food, energy, materials, manufacturing, and pharmaceutical 
industries. Stem cells are promising to bring the hope of a permanent cure for 
diseases that currently cannot be cured by conventional drugs. Cell therapies are 
becoming highly effective, safe, and predictively reproducible while at the same 
time becoming affordable and widely available.

•	 Tissue Engineering: This is often referred to as regenerative medicine and repar­
ative medicine. It has emerged as an interdisciplinary field that combines the 
efforts of cell biologists, engineers, material scientists, mathematicians, geneti­
cists, and clinicians toward the development of biological substitutes that 
improve tissue function. Cells placed within constructs are the most common 
strategy in tissue engineering. In tissue engineering, additive fabrication pro­
cesses have been used to produce scaffolds with customized external shape [11]. 
18.3  Applications

264
 
10
Tissue engineering is a reliable option to cure cardiovascular disease, which is a 
leading cause of death in the world. Tissue engineering has also been employed 
to promote bone and cartilage regeneration. Biomaterials play an important role 
in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. With the increasing demand for 
tissue repair, a plethora of biomaterials are modified and exploited in various 
applications.
•	 Food Manufacturing: The food processing industry uses biomanufactured prod­
ucts. The fermentation process (enzyme and microorganism reaction) has found 
an ever-increasing suite of uses throughout food manufacturing. Products manu­
factured for food and beverage must be produced in a facility that has been 
designed within the confines of good manufacturing practices (GMP) 
regulations.
•	 Additive Biomanufacturing: This is perhaps the most exciting potential applica­
tion of biomanufacturing. It produces on-demand tissues and even organs through 
a “3D printing.” platform. This is the use of 3D printing. Additive manufacturing 
has been used to produce implants specially designed for a particular patient, 
with sizes, shapes, and optimized mechanical properties in many areas of medi­
cine. 3D printing technologies are potential techniques for the development of 
porous mechanically tuned metallic and ceramic-based implants for medical 
applications. They allow the design and fabrication of a range of products from 
18  Biomanufacturing

preoperative models, cutting guides, and medical devices to scaffolds. Additive 
manufacturing has been used to produce implants specially designed for a par­
ticular patient, with sizes, shapes, and mechanical properties optimized [12].
•	 Smart Biomanufacturing: To improve yield, reduce time to market, and facilitate 
process validation, smart biomanufacturing processes must deliver insights into 
biological behavior. The race for smart biopharma processes is driven by three 
trends: personalized drugs, flexibility as a means to make plants smarter, and 
using digitalization to acquire a deep process understanding for continuous, real-­
time quality control [13].
•	 Continuous Biomanufacturing: This refers to processes that occur on an ongoing 
basis after an initial catalyzation, with a minimum of monitoring. It requires 
continuous, accurate process monitoring. The trend toward improving process 
efficiency and control has advanced continuous manufacturing processes. The 
benefits of continuous manufacturing include significant economic advantages, 
reduced equipment size, enhanced cost efficiency, and high volumetric produc­
tivity. As a result, there is a lot of interest in small-scale continuous manufactur­
ing technology although this is challenging. Challenges such as population 
heterogeneity and loss of the catalyst need to be overcome. Continuous biopro­
cessing (both in upstream and downstream operations) has been proposed as one 
future biomanufacturing state because it operates at similar scales for both clini­
cal and commercial production. It requires working with multiple smaller col­
umns. Through continuous bioprocessing, large amounts of the product may be 
manufactured with smaller equipment, decreasing the overall capital investment. 
Continuous bioprocessing can result in better-quality products due to higher 
purities and lesser impurities. Continuous biomanufacturing potentially provides 
significant improvements in the development and production of biopharmaceuti­
cals. The drug industry has been slow to adopt continuous biomanufacturing 
largely because of costs and regulatory concerns [14].
•	 Electronics: Biomanufacturing presents exciting possibilities in electronic com­
ponent manufacturing such as printed circuits and touch sensors at a fraction of 
the energy cost of traditional materials.
•	 Consumer Products: Biomanufacturing produces all manner of consumer goods 
including beauty supplies, plastic products and components, nylon, textiles, 
paper, and more.
•	 Single-Use Systems: Since their initial development, single-use systems are 
being increasingly used in almost all stages of biomanufacturing processes. They 
are new technologies that dramatically lower building of biomanufacturing 
plants. Their intention is to create factories that can manufacture multiple prod­
ucts at a single site in a modular manner.
Other areas of applications of biomanufacturing include perfusion biomanufac­
turing, cell-free biomanufacturing, plant-based protein biomanufacturing, commer­
cial biomanufacturing, cell line development, and the military.
18.3  Applications

266
18.4  Benefits
Biomanufacturing is an industrial production technology that uses living cells as 
miniature factories to produce products designed to detect, modify, maintain, and 
study biological organisms.
Biomanufacturing also provides opportunities for multidisciplinary collabora­
tions, both in academia and industry. Challenges facing humankind, such as food 
security, renewable energy, urbanization, and climate change motivate rapid devel­
opments in biomanufacturing platforms. Much interest in biomanufacturing relates 
to medical products, but agriculture and livestock farming are also biomanufactur­
ing at their most fundamental. Other benefits of biomanufacturing include [7, 15].
•	 Biomanufactured Products: Thousands of biomanufactured products are avail­
able on the market today. They are found in natural sources like cultures of 
microbes, blood, or plant and animal cells. They are classified by medicine, food 
and beverage, and industrial applications. In the medical field, amino acids, vac­
cines, cytokines, fusion proteins, growth factors, biopharmaceuticals, and mono­
clonal antibodies all utilize biomanufactured products. In the food and beverage 
industry, biomanufactured products include amino acids, enzymes, and protein 
supplements. Industrial applications that require biomanufactured products 
include biocementation, detergents, plastics, and bioremediation.
•	 Energy Use Reduction: Biomanufacturing vastly reduces this energy require­
ment in favor of production through natural reactions. It replaces energy-­intensive 
processes with naturally occurring processes that often require only sunlight and 
a controlled environment to be initiated. Lower energy usage and costs benefit 
the environment, as well as manufacturers and consumers.
•	 Increased Innovation: It is already impacting a wide range of industries, and it is 
driving incredible, unprecedented technological advancements. The possibilities 
of biomanufacturing are providing our best minds with the ideal jumping-off 
point to innovate across numerous industries.
•	 Sustainability: Materials and products created through biotechnology are easier 
and safer to recycle and dispose. The long-term sustainability of biomanufactur­
ing can solve the problems of waste disposal and toxic material. Growing bio­
manufacturing will help enhance a sustainable economy and green 
biomanufacturing.
18.5  Challenges
In manufacturing, interactions between humans and machines are changing, and 
machines are acquiring decision-making capabilities. The biomanufacturing indus­
try is no exception. It is important to understand this and balance capacity versus 
demand and staffing level. Manufacturing medicine using biology poses different 
challenges from the traditional chemical manufacturing processes. Significant 
18  Biomanufacturing

267
improvements in biomanufacturing are required to enhance safety, quality, and con­
sistency of biopharmaceutical products while reducing the manufacturing cost. As 
with any emerging technology, the biggest challenge is changing the current mind­
set. New entrants to emerging markets will face many challenges and opportunities, 
depending on the particulars of the location they target.
•	 Complexity: Biomanufacturing is a complex, labor-intensive industry requiring a 
combination of skills from several disciplines. The inherent complexity increases 
the drag on the process of innovation. Biomanufacturing has been shaped by 
large capital requirements, high operating costs, and complex processes. This 
has made it an expensive business to operate.
•	 Affordability: Commercial biomanufacturing faces a major challenge as cost ele­
ments continue to be a huge problem. Establishing a new commercial biomanu­
facturing facility may cost one billion dollar. The affordability and 
cost-effectiveness of biologic therapy are increasingly important. The cost of 
goods of biologics is still relatively high. We need to find innovative ways of 
reducing this to ensure these types of biological therapies and vaccines are more 
affordable. The pharmaceutical industry is at an important crossroad. It must cut 
costs and develop safe and cost-efficient processes for new biological products.
•	 Hiring Problems: As the bioprocess industry expands, some facilities will face 
major hiring problems. The apparent decrease in hiring problems may be due to 
the fact that some companies have been successful in streamlining their pro­
cesses, making them more efficient, more automated, faster, and less expensive. 
That can reduce pressure on workers [16].
•	 No Regulations: Regulation is a friend, not a foe of innovation, in bioproduction 
processes. The industry has no regulatory requirements for single-use technolo­
gies (SUTs). Some specific single-use parts are listed in the requirements, but 
such requirements are not defined for all production steps [17]. This lack of regu­
lation is only at the local level. However, biomanufacturing processes is heavily 
regulated globally, due to its use of genetically modified organisms.
•	 Lack of Infrastructure: The lack of appropriate biomanufacturing and supply-­
chain infrastructure is a key barrier for widespread and equitable distribution of 
vaccines for COVID-19 across the world. This requires a fundamental change in 
national and global science policy.
•	 Workforce Challenges: These including balancing collaboration with competi­
tion for talent, expanding the talent pipeline, and securing the funding required 
to support essential workforce development. Competition among companies 
vying to hire the best talent creates an inherent obstacle to executing a 
­collaborative regional workforce strategy. What is needed in manufacturing is 
building both executive-level talent and the technical biomanufacturing work­
force. To achieve this, the region must strike a balance between recruiting com­
petition and executing a cohesive, collaborative regional talent strategy [18].
18.7
18.5  Challenges

268
 
18.6  Global Biomanufacturing
Biomanufacturing is beginning a global transformation. It produces a wide range of 
products for the global bioeconomy. The changes taking shape in the global bio­
manufacturing industry will fundamentally alter the global playing field. Success in 
the globally distributed biomanufacturing industry will be a function of how well 
companies can leverage new technologies and manage the challenges of biomanu­
facturing. A lion’s share of global biomanufacturers are located in North America, 
Western Europe, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. We now consider how biomanu­
facturing is being implemented in some nations.
•	 United States: The United States is the world’s leading producer of manufac­
tured goods. It is also a global leader in biomanufacturing, and the industry con­
tinues to grow in US biomanufacturing as an industry is experiencing explosive 
growth within the United States. It is a manufacturing revolution that can make 
the United States self-sufficient. American companies are working to build a 
sustainable, domestic manufacturing ecosystem that will enable domestic bio-­
industrial manufacturing, develop technologies to enhance US bio-industrial 
18  Biomanufacturing

269
competitiveness, de-risk investment in relevant infrastructure, and expand the 
biomanufacturing workforce to realize the economic promise of industrial bio­
technology. Although the United States leads the world in innovations and inven­
tions, the manufacturing capabilities and new products are often “stranded in the 
lab,” or get outsourced to other nations. The competitiveness of US manufactur­
ing has been challenged by other developed nations such as Japan, Germany, and 
Korea, as well as developing nations such as China [19].
•	 United Kingdom: The chemical industry is vitally important to the UK economy. 
The United Kingdom has a solid research base from which to grow a vibrant 
biomanufacturing economy. The United Kingdom must continue to build on 
excellence if it is to remain a prime bioprocessing location. What the United 
Kingdom is doing right has been assessed and recommendations have been made 
regarding, and the direction it needs to head in the coming decade if it is to stay 
a leading center for biomanufacturing. The UK has become a biomanufacturing 
cluster similar to Research Triangle Park or Boston in the United States with 260 
companies, and around 12 thousand people actively focused on developing or 
manufacturing biologicals. There are rumors that the United Kingdom intends to 
remain a top location for the production of biologicals and is going to increase its 
biomanufacturing capacity [20]. The United Kingdom cannot do everything and 
needs to be strategic. The nation could focus on manufacturing value-added 
products and develop the innovation expertise to export processes and technolo­
gies to manufacturing organizations overseas [21].
•	 China: Biomanufacturing is relatively new in China; the country is just getting 
started. An emerging trend in the contract manufacturing organization (CMO) 
market is the rise of China as both a customer and potential supplier of biologics. 
As biopharmaceutical growth is also increasing in China. China, as a high-­
growth region, is moving at unprecedented speeds and is thirsty to train its work­
force in biologics GMP best practices to meet the demand for skilled labor. 
China is likely to be America’s chief competitor in what may prove to be a super­
power manufacturing technology race in which staying ahead will be a national 
security imperative.
•	 Australia: An Australia-based contract manufacturing organization, Luina Bio, 
offers microbial fermentation services for drug development and manufacturing. 
The company has more than 20 years of experience and produce commercial 
veterinary products for clients within Australia and internationally. Luina Bio’s 
manufacturing facility houses fermentation vessels and offers a full suite of man­
ufacturing for both whole-cell preparations. The company offers world-leading 
fermentation and related services in fermentation and subsequent downstream 
purification [22].
•	 Canada: The government of Canada ensures access to critical vaccines, thera­
peutics, and other health products. At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
Government of Canada took early and decisive action to strengthen Canada’s 
biomanufacturing capacity to protect Canadians. The Government of Canada has 
also committed a substantial amount of money to support research and develop­
ment, clinical trials, and future pandemic preparedness [23].
18.6  Global Biomanufacturing

270
•	 Russia: The Russian company R-Pharm is a good example of the evolving bio­
manufacturing industry in research and development. The success of its distribu­
tion business has enabled the company’s strategic plan to build a fully integrated 
drug discovery, development, manufacturing, and distribution across Russia. 
R-Pharm is well an established, successful business employing top talent. It has 
access to excellent science, both in-house and through partnerships with leading 
universities. R-Pharm works with domestic and international partners like the 
United States and China to simultaneously advance the core elements of its bio­
logics program. This strategy is designed to significantly reduce time to clinic 
and market [24].
•	 South Korea: The South Korean biopharmaceutical company Samsung Biologics 
is set to break ground as one of the world’s largest manufacturing facilities within 
a single location. It also helps streamline production. The super biomanufactur­
ing facility will be both larger and more expensive than all three of Samsung’s 
existing plants combined. The global scramble for biomanufacturing, drug 
development resources, and COVID-19 treatments prompted the extreme 
increase in size. The ambitious facility will begin taking on outsourced manufac­
turing demand due to COVID-19 [25].
•	 Singapore: Biomanufacturing constitutes a critical pillar in Singapore’s econ­
omy and has much potential to be further strengthened through innovation. With 
strong expertise in digitalization and manufacturing, Singapore can strategically 
leverage its capabilities to drive the local industry for the future by addressing 
resource sustainability, diversification of supply and logistic chains, and afford­
able drugs. With the guiding objective of promoting research and development, 
feasible breakthroughs in biologics manufacturing technologies can increase 
operational efficiencies. Talent development through training remains the main 
thrust, as competent and skilled workforce is needed [26].
18.7  Future of Biomanufacturing
The dynamics of biopharmaceutical manufacturing are changing. Biopharmaceutical 
companies are booming and growing at an exponential rate due to the robust adop­
tion of advanced technologies in the biomanufacturing industry such as artificial 
intelligence, augmented reality, and digital twins. The companies continue to 
expand in revenue, breadth, importance, and diversity. Globalization is increasing 
the industry’s geographic scale, and clearly the pharmaceutical market is continuing 
to expand its reach globally. By exploring the history of the biomanufacturing mar­
ket and by analyzing both past and ongoing key trends, one can predict what the 
future of the industry is likely to hold. We identify and outline key production trends 
below and build toward a detailed vision for the future of biomanufacturing. By 
harnessing the best aspects of biomanufacturing, we can create a future where a new 
economy supports local communities, empowers new innovation, and spreads eco­
nomic power to segments of society left behind.
18  Biomanufacturing

271
The key technology trends that are influencing the biomanufacturing market 
include [27]:
•	 Cost reduction: Due to the high cost associated with the biomanufacturing indus­
try, the requirement to reduce cost is imperative.
•	 Collaboration: Biomanufacturing provides great opportunities for multidisci­
plinary collaborations. Different manufacturing sectors will need to share ideas 
and technology. Collaboration between research and development teams and 
manufacturing partners is an important factor in future biomanufacturing. Their 
effort must focus on the next-generation biomanufacturing.
•	 Advanced Technology: Advanced manufacturing technologies can propel inno­
vations. Adoption of advanced technologies as well as new innovation in the 
form of design, efficiency, performance, and others are some of the factors that 
will likely enhance the growth of the next-generation biomanufacturing market, 
which will boost various lucrative opportunities. The next-generation biomanu­
facturing market is expected to gain market growth.
•	 Increased Funding: Biomanufacturing growth will be dictated by price controls 
imposed directly by governments and the prevalence of funds from government 
and from private organizations for the development of innovative technology 
which will further boost various opportunities.
•	 Automation: Automated systems are gaining a foothold in the market as they can 
reduce costs related to the production process and can also enhance productivity. 
Automation also reduces manual, human errors.
•	 Single-Use Technologies: These are gaining widespread acceptance with more 
preference for systems that are connected in a sequence and are being used for 
large-scale manufacturing.
These biomanufacturing trends are appropriate for regional communities and 
promise to leave our environment and society more adaptable and resilient.
18.8  Conclusion
In essence, biomanufacturing applies the principles of engineering and chemical 
design to biological systems. Biomanufacturing is the use of advanced manufactur­
ing approaches to produce the next generation of healthcare products. The biomanu­
facturing revolution is changing the way we think of centralized systems and our 
relationship to nature.
Although biomanufacturing has played an important role in the past three indus­
trial revolutions, biomanufacturing 4.0 (or advanced biomanufacturing) will be one 
of the most important cornerstones of the sustainability revolution of the twenty-­
first century [28].
Biomanufacturing academic programs are designed to prepare students for posi­
tions in pharmaceutical manufacturing, bioprocessing, media preparation, bioen­
ergy production, and the food processing industry. Well-informed and prepared

Chapter 19
Future of Manufacturing
19.1  Introduction
In essence, manufacturing is the act of transforming raw material into products that 
benefit society. It is a key component of economic growth and the bedrock on which 
a nation’s economy is built. However, manufacturing is constantly changing and 
continuously evolving from concept development to methods and tools. It is no 
longer just a process that turns raw materials into physical products. It consists of a 
wider set of activities that create value and benefits for the society. It contributes to 
wealth, exports, innovation, and productivity growth. As manufacturers desire to 
stay competitive in the marketplace, they are constantly searching for the latest and 
greatest inventions, strategies, and systems. They welcome technology that prom­
ises greater efficiency and productivity with open arms [1].
The major challenges limiting the potential sales and profit growth in the manu­
facturing section are market volatility, rising material costs, product quality and 
reliability, price reduction pressures, increasing labor costs, digitizing the work­
force, level of digitization, creativity and innovation, and transportation/logistics 
costs. Also, the current manufacturing infrastructure is costly to maintain, integrates 
poorly with other systems, and prevents companies from capitalizing on the advan­
tages of digitalization. To address these challenges and make a successful transition 
to the next generation of manufacturing, manufacturers are making significant 
investments in equipment and systems and adoption of new technologies [2]. 
Manufacturers always strive to be more innovative, whether by developing new 
products or improving existing ones. Manufacturing is increasingly becoming more 
efficient, intelligent, customized, sustainable, and automated. The future of manu­
facturing sector is undeniably digital and will be shaped by a combination of 
advancements in technology.
The future of manufacturing is in technology. The next 
generation of manufacturing champions will come from those 
companies that use brain power, not labor, to drive their 
innovations.

Technology is evolving and is transforming the manufacturing industry. Each 
year brings new technologies that are changing the face of manufacturing. Some of 
the most significant benefits that technology brings to the manufacturing industry 
include energy efficiency, predictive maintenance, improved product quality, down­
time reduction to zero, increased level of digitization, enhanced customer demand, 
and informed decisions [3]. Emerging technologies that have great impact in manu­
facturing include artificial intelligence, smart manufacturing, robotic automation, 
3D printing, nanotechnology, industrial Internet of Things, and augmented reality. 
The use of these technologies will have a profound impact on the future of manu­
facturing industry. They have the potential to transform manufacturing as we know 
it. They should be at the core of any manufacturing upgrading effort [4].
This chapter takes a close look at the challenges that manufacturers are facing 
now and see what the future holds for manufacturing. It begins by reviewing the 
emerging manufacturing technologies. It considers the future of technology in man­
ufacturing and the factory of the future. It highlights the challenges facing the man­
ufacturing industry in the future. It covers the future of global manufacturing. The 
last section concludes with comments.
19.2  Emerging Manufacturing Technologies
All manufacturers can position themselves to capitalize on the benefits of new and 
innovative emerging technologies. By prioritizing a digital-first strategy and plan­
ning holistically around key issues, leaders can regear their companies’ all-round 
capabilities and competitiveness. They must also wrestle with disruptive technolo­
gies that have been appearing on the horizon for years now. These include [5]:
•	 Social and mobile capabilities were some of the first next-generation trends that 
became must-have capabilities very quickly.
•	 Product configuration tools such as the NX and CATIA turnkey integrated 
design, manufacturing and enterprise-wide systems, incorporating integrated 
computer-assisted design (CAD) systems, and late-stage assembly helped manu­
factures meet demands for mass customization.
•	 Robotics changed operational technology dramatically, just as shop-floor auto­
mation revolutionized workflows and production cycles.
•	 Big data started conversations about factories becoming predictive, leveraging 
analytics, and creating strategies for identifying customer expectations.
•	 Cloud computing fueled the imagination further, making storage of immense 
pools of data possible.
•	 Prototyping with 3D printing (or additive manufacturing) tooling allows manu­
facturers to design and print their own tools.
•	 The Internet of Things far surpasses all of these disruptive technologies. The 
potential impact of the IoT is truly staggering and hard to grasp.
•	 Nanomaterials will be used more widely in the future of manufacturing.
19  Future of Manufacturing

277
•	 Manufacturing workers will use AI to speed the adoption of technologies aug­
menting their work.
•	 Manufacturing will transition from making parts to “as-a-service” busi­
ness models.
•	 New materials pose new requirements on the manufacturing plants.
This is not a comprehensive list. These technologies can connect billions of peo­
ple to the web and drastically improve the efficiency of business and organizations. 
Some of the technologies will be further discussed in the next section.
19.3  Future of Technology in Manufacturing
The future of manufacturing is essentially in everybody’s interest. It will determine 
our jobs, our consumption patterns, and the quality of life for this and future genera­
tions [6].
Nanotechnology, cloud computing, robotics, artificial intelligence, the Internet 
of Things, Industry 4.0, and additive manufacturing are all improving manufactur­
ing processes. It is worth examining the common thread running through all these 
technologies [7, 8].

•	 Internet of Things (IoT): This is the answer for manufacturers looking for solu­
tions to complete maintenance proactively. IoT refers to the connectivity between 
devices that are able to communicate and exchange data with one another. IoT is 
revolutionizing manufacturing. It may be regarded as the nerve system of a man­
ufacturing plant. It is helping manufacturers connect and monitor the various 
components of their operations, gaining insight never before possible. The IoT 
market is growing steadily and is likely to continue to do so in the foreseeable 
future. The industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is the future of manufacturing. It 
refers to the use of a system of interconnected computing devices that can trans­
fer data over a network without any human involvement. The idea is that every­
thing, from the bottom up to the cloud, needs to be connected.
•	 Additive Manufacturing or 3D Printing: This technology is rapidly gaining trac­
tion and revolutionizing how the manufacturing industry approaches product 
development. Manufacturers will benefit from faster, less expensive production 
as a result of 3D printing. Advancements in additive manufacturing can help 
companies reduce energy costs, limit waste, and boost production. 3D printing 
gives manufacturers a way of creating tangible product prototypes without com­
mitting to a costly production process.
19  Future of Manufacturing

•	 Artificial Intelligence: AI can convert large amounts of raw data into information 
that a human can read and interpret. AI has played an increasingly vital role in 
automation. AI-powered robots are increasingly being used in manufacturing. 
Manufacturers are attempting to have their manufacturing systems partially or 
fully automated in order to reduce labor costs, increase operation efficiency, and 
increase the production rate. The integration of the expert system, an artificial 
intelligence tool, into mainstream information technology will promote increased 
exploitation of this technology in the manufacturing sector.
•	 Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality: Virtual reality is becoming very popular 
within the entertainment industry as it is allowing consumers to immerse them­
selves in the worlds in which they play. Augmented reality gives manufacturers 
the opportunity to test products in a virtual real-life platform. Augmented reality 
is also a tool that manufacturers will find useful in increasing productivity. 
Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have different applications in 
manufacturing and are poised to improve manufacturing in myriad ways. These

technologies will impact areas like training and maintenance in various ways. 
They will yield greater efficiency, improved accuracy, and predictive mainte­
nance by providing more visibility and insight into processes.
19.3 11
­
Other important technologies such as nanotechnology, cloud computing, busi­
ness intelligence, and blockchain are all improving manufacturing. They are push­
ing manufacturers to explore radically new ways of creating and capturing value. 
For both incumbents and new entrants, these technologies will serve as tools to 
successfully navigate the new landscape of manufacturing. Nations that are cur­
rently investing in these technologies are the ones that will dominate global manu­
facturing in the future. Although manufacturing will be dominated by new 
technologies, the changes will be led by humans.

For sure, the factory of the future will be interconnected, flexible, smart, small, 
and movable (to where the resources are and where the customers are) with work­
ers, customers, and suppliers all having more real-time transparency. Future facto­
ries will make intensive use of automation, technology, and people [13]:
•	 Automation: Automation makes it possible for manufacturers to reach new levels 
of production, precision, and safety. It will become even more influential in the 
manufacturing industry. It is predicted to drive job growth in the manufacturing 
industry. In the factory of the future, robots will be far more advanced and col­
laborative. Robots have become invaluable for monotonous jobs such as packag­
ing, sorting, and repeated lifting. The widespread misperception that automation 
and AI will put manufacturing jobs at risk is not valid.
•	 Technology: The factory of the future will employ a wide range of cutting-edge, 
fast-changing, disruptive technologies. Factories will make use of modern tech­
nologies such as artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, and the 
Internet of Things. These technologies will be integrated within the factory.
•	 People: The future of manufacturing is people. It’s technology-enabled but 
human-driven. In the future factory, there is a need for a highly talented, skilled, 
and flexible workforce. Workers in a highly-skilled manufacturing sector are a 
true competitive asset for any company. Manufacturing decision-makers must 
create a friendly environment in order to get the most out of employees.
19.4  Factory of the Future

282
19.5  Challenges
Technological advances are not without their challenges. Some of the challenges 
that the manufacturing industry will face in the future include [14]:
•	 Global Competition: The growing trade war between China and the United 
States continues to strain manufacturing worldwide. According to the 2019 US-­
China Business Council survey on trade relations between the two countries, the 
top concern among foreign companies operating in China was unfair competi­
tion. China has become the world’s leading manufacturing country. Manufacturing 
in the United States has been in long-term decline, with the competitive advan­
tage moving to low-cost countries such as Mexico and China. This has caused 
the United States to change its focus and move to innovative products that require 
engineering and sophistication. With increasingly automated factory, the advan­
tage of being a low-cost country (such as Mexico, China, and Thailand) starts 
to fade.
•	 New Technology: Technology is advancing at a rapid pace. Technology is chang­
ing the comparative advantages that drive competitiveness. It is no secret that 
technology is rapidly growing, and companies across all industries are under­
standing how to utilize the best tools for bottom-line success. Due to the complex 
nature of manufacturing, the adoption of latest technologies is always difficult. A 
tough decision is allocating resources toward R&D or sustaining their existing 
systems.
•	 Customer Demand: Customers demand personalization and customization from 
manufacturers. Increasing consumer demand for high-quality, personalized 
goods is fueling the need for flexible and fast manufacturing processes that 
respond to customer and market demands. The shifts in consumer demand are 
compelling manufacturers to explore radically new ways of creating and captur­
ing value. Manufacturers will need to deal with the increased customer demand 
for personalization, faster completion, and maximum transparency.
•	 Cybersecurity: This should be a major concern for all industries including manu­
facturing. Connected devices are vulnerable to cyberattacks. Cybersecurity is a 
national and global phenomenon of grave importance because the malicious use 
of cyberspace could hamper economic, public health, safety, and national secu­
rity activities. It is becoming more and more important as more information is 
being made available on computer networks. Cybersecurity breaches cannot be 
stopped at a nation’s borders since it is difficult to determine where the actual 
borders are in cyberspace. Thus, cybersecurity can become a supranational prob­
lem. Manufacturers will need to mitigate risks more than ever [15].
•	 Workforce: An important question to ask is what will the manufacturing work­
force in the future look like? The future of manufacturing is people. The manu­
facturing sector will still need people who can manage new operations, manage 
robotics, and maintain them. The future of manufacturing depends on building 
19  Future of Manufacturing

283
the necessary workforce. Manufacturers are reporting talent shortages as they 
struggle to find the right blend of technical and soft skills to fill new positions. 
The mismatch between available workers and the advanced technical skills nec­
essary in modern manufacturing has been dubbed the “skills gap” [16]. The gap 
between available jobs and the number of skilled workers is growing. This skills 
gap remains a serious problem. As the manufacturing landscape changes with 
time, workers’ roles in the manufacturing industry will change. Manufacturers 
will need more people with technological expertise. In other words, manufactur­
ers still need a large number of skilled workers to handle new technologies. 
Instead of detracting from the role humans play in manufacturing, AI will sup­
port them to take on new roles, ultimately creating more opportunities for 
employees than it will eliminate [17]. The manufacturing workforce will shift in 
size, shape, preparation, and required skills.

19.6  Future of Global Manufacturing
Technology is changing so fast that what was successful today is not necessarily 
going to be as successful tomorrow. Globally, manufacturing continues to grow and 
thrive. The success of a manufacturing business depends on how quickly it can 
adapt to the changing world. The more agile the business operations can be, the 
faster they can adapt to this new world. Although the global manufacturing sector 
has undergone a tumultuous decade, manufacturing is critically important to both 
developing and developed nations. It improves standards of living, builds economic 
prosperity, provides employment, promotes innovation, increases productivity, min­
imizes human errors, enhances efficiency, and boosts return on investment (ROI). 
Globally, manufacturing continues to grow and change. The United States, Europe, 
and East Asia dominate global manufacturing through heavy investment in robotics, 
AI, and IoT technologies. Economies such as India, Indonesia, and China have risen 
to the top ranks of the 15 largest global manufacturing economies [18]. We now 
consider the future of manufacturing in some nations.
•	 United States: America’s manufacturing revolution is occurring now. Although 
manufacturing in the United States as well as “Made in the USA” has been in 
long-term decline, US manufacturers are typically bullish about future growth 
prospects. Emerging technologies such as nanotechnology, automation, and 
robotics have modernized American factories making them smaller, modular, 
safer, and smarter than their predecessors. Manufacturers in the United States 
should have an opportunity to win more business there while continuing to com­
pete on the global stage for highly engineered products. Although some claim 
that China is becoming more expensive, the competitive advantage may not nec­
essarily shift back to the United States.
•	 United Kingdom: Manufacturing continues to be an essential part of the UK 
economy. The importance of manufacturing to the UK economy is incontrovert­
ible. UK government demonstrated its support of manufacturing by uniquely 
commissioning a strategic look at the future of manufacturing as far ahead as 
2050. Constant adaptability will pervade all aspects of manufacturing in the 
United Kingdom, from research and development to customer interdependen­
cies. The quality and skills of the workforce will be a critical factor in capturing 
competitive advantage. UK policymakers need to focus on the supply of skilled 
workers [19].
•	 India: Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a program called Make in India. 
Do you think initiatives like Make in India and the ascent of manufacturing in 
other parts of Asia have a chance of succeeding? A large paint company in India 
has used the combination of industrialized sensors, automation, and social media 
analytics to catalyze both internal operations and customer-driven product 
development.
19  Future of Manufacturing

285
•	 Asia: Asia has been known as a cost-effective manufacturing hub due to its vast 
labor pool. Several Asian manufacturers fabricate products ranging from auto­
mobiles to consumer electronics. As the advantage of labor dwindles, newer 
paradigms of productivity, operational visibility, and risk management are 
needed for Asian manufacturers to stay competitive. By getting rid of their tradi­
tional approaches to maintaining competitiveness, Asian manufacturers can fully 
capture the benefits of digital. Manufacturers in Asia need to upskill their work­
ers, focusing on developing and capitalizing on the capabilities that are uniquely 
human. They need to act today or risk becoming obsolete [20].
•	 Latin America: China and its “unlimited supply of labor,” rapid productivity, 
growth, scale, and government intervention has made China a formidable com­
petitor to Latin American manufacturers and raises many questions about their 
future. This has unprecedentedly challenged the future of Latin America and the 
Caribbean (LAC) in the world’s division of labor. Mexico and Brazil are appar­
ently on the way to a head-on collision with Chinese exporters since they rely 
heavily on industries such as apparel, textile, and electronics where China has 
huge comparative and competitive advantages. The future of manufacturing in 
LAC is often seen with pessimism on the grounds of geography and endow­
ments. Chinese challenge does not make the manufacturing future any brighter 
in LAC [21].
19.7  Conclusion
Although no one can predict the future, one can confidently say that the future of 
manufacturing is bright. The future of manufacturing is not only technology-enabled 
but human-driven. The companies that can adapt, innovate, and utilize global 
resources will generate significant growth and success. Large-scale production will 
continue to dominate some segments of the value chain. The future of manufactur­
ing looks bright.
Manufacturers are always confronted with a choice: to adopt new technology 
and move forward or ignore it and stand still. Forward-looking manufacturers know 
that, to stay on top, they must keep ahead of industry trends. They are already revis­
iting and shaping their manufacturing capabilities.
Since the future of manufacturing is human, there is a need to prepare the next 
generation of skilled workers in a future manufacturing environment that incorpo­
rates increased use of artificial intelligence, robots, 3D printing, and biotechnology. 
Future workers must have a combination of both hard (technical) skills and soft 
skills to succeed. Both governments and businesses should make education and the 
development of skills their priorities. Manufacturers must constantly train their 
workers to keep them current and become citizen developers. For more information 
about the future of manufacturing, one should consult the books in [22–24].
