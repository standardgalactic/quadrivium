FOUR POEMS IN TRANSLATION 
HARRY MARTINSON 
Voice 
from the Land of the Eons 
Already his favorite angels gather around him, 
though, 
in their competition 
for his favors, they hate each 
other. 
United 
by their hatred, 
united by their grievances, 
now they openly 
love their fall more 
than uprightness, 
worship 
as divine their chaos, 
mirrored 
in a crucible of chaotic fire. 
Therefore 
they are permitted 
to leave, 
to depart 
into the 
darkness 
they love, 
into the chaos they have found good. 
Thus 
it must be. 
I split my kingdom. 
I shift my cinders. 
They 
topple over in ellipses 
like comets, 
errant stars created by their fall. 
There 
is an infernal shriek, heard not by ears, 
only by suns. 
They howl, they shriek among the light-eating 
spheres. 
Love 
is a necessity, 
But these have adopted 
their hatred 
as a duty towards the country and the spirit. 
Their 
error 
has momentum. 
They do not stop themselves. 
Damned 
they fall. 
The 
Swedish 
Academy 
announced 
on October

that Harry 
Martinson 
is the 
cowinner of the 1974 Nobel Prize in Literature.

Voice 
from the Land of the Archons 
He found himself 
surrounded by our thick darkness. 
Then he blinded us with his eternal light, 
thrust us out into the dark kingdom 
of outer space. 
It sufficed us for an eternity. 
Our kingdom 
has no borders, 
for he owns all the borders. 
He extends 
them until in our kingdom 
they become 
faint. 
So our darkness obliterates 
his borders 
by absorbing 
them into his outermost 
fading light. 
To us his goodness was 
too hot, 
just as to him our evil is too cold. 
Thus, his is the hottest power, a warming 
goodness 
only at a 
distance. 
It is our kingdom 
that reduces his creative heat 
to a comfortable warmth with 
room for tenderness. 
We 
fight over the darkest shadows and the lightest lights. 
We 
can never increase his innermost 
light. 
He 
cannot 
warm 
or arouse 
the 
grave 
of 
the 
outermost 
void. 
The Truths of Silence 
Privately 
and in silence, 
either they are there 
or they 
are not. 
You 
cannot 
see 
them: 
if you could it would 
be easy. 
They 
are significant

simply because 
they do not depend 
on retorts and contradic 
tions. 
They 
are based on the truth which 
you have 
in yourself, 
and the honesty with which 
you experience 
your silence. 
In the long rim it is they who are decisive 
in all small rooms, 
in the infinite number of small rooms in every land.

The World 
Tree 
Last night I saw the world 
tree 
casting its dark shadow. 
An extinguished 
giant candelabra, 
completely 
concealing 
the bright window 
of heaven 
An 
autumnal 
tree, 
a bitter 
tree, 
an immovable 
tree with dripping bark. 
Perhaps 
there still were 
storms, 
perhaps people were 
still uttering 
shrill cries, 
but all this happened 
deep down 
there 
where no change is possible. 
A tree I saw and the heavy birds of death, 
moving 
idly from one branch 
to another.
