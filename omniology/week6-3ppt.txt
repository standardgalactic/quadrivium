H-P AXIS-THYROID  
LEARNING OBJECTIVES: 
1. Describe the morphology and biological role of the  
thyroid.  
2. Explain the structure of thyroid hormones, their  
synthesis and secretion by follicular cells.  
3. Describe how plasma thyroid hormone levels are  
regulated by the hypothalamus-pituitary axis, by  
conversion (deiodinases), and by carriers.  
4. Describe the mechanism of action of thyroid hormones. 
5. Explain the effect of hyper- and hypo-secretion of thyroid 
hormone on basal metabolism. What happens to thyroid  
hormone in prolonged fasting and in restricted diets? 

STRUCTURE 
OF GLAND 
Gland changes in size 
with activity state  
Thyroid gland has 2 lobes 

Relative activity: T3> T4>> rT3 (inactive)  
Both iodine atoms on inner ring and one on 
outer ring essential 
THYROID HORMONES 

FOLICULAR CELL ACTIVITY 

H-P-THYROID AXIS  
Caloric signal = leptin from fat 
 
High leptin levels in blood  
indicate “full” fuel stores.  
TH axis is activated 

TISSUE CONVERSION 
BY DEIODINASES 
Deiodinase I - regulated 
by energy levels.  
 
Deiodinase II - not regulated. 
 
Which deiodinase regulates 
CNS, heart and skeletal 
Muscle?  

In mild fasting, shift to T4 state = lower metabolic rate.  
 
Why is TSH reduced in severe fasting?   

PATHOLOGY 
TOO LITTLE: 
 
Congenital hypothyroidism  
 
Hypothyroidism 
 
Goiter  
 
TOO MUCH: 
 
Hyperthyroidism 
 
Grave’s Disease 
 
Goiter 
 
IODINE DEFICIENCY: 
 
Goiter- absence of hormone 

KEY CONCEPTS 
T3 and T4 are synthesized and secreted by the thyroid  
gland in response to TSH. 
 
Thyroid hormones are formed from the hydrolysis of  
iodinated thyroglobulin. 
 
Dietary iodine is essential for the hormone synthesis. 
 
Under normal conditions, the majority of T3 is made  
from T4 in the peripheral tissues by enzymes called  
deiodinases. This is an important site for regulating BMR. 
 
Thyroid hormones are essential for the development of  
the nervous system, for normal body growth and to  
regulate basal energy and temperature.
