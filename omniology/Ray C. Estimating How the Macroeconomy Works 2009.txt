Preface
This book presents my work in macroeconomics from 1994 to the present. It is an 
extension of the work in Fair (1984, 1994). The period since 1994 contains the U.S. 
stock market boom and what some consider to be a “new age” of high productivity 
growth and low inflation. It is also the period that includes the introduction of the euro. 
A number of chapters are directly concerned with these issues. This period is also one 
of continuing large advances in computer speeds, which allows much more to be done 
in Chapters 9-14 than could have been done earlier.
The macro theory that underlies this work is briefly outlined in section 1.3 and 
discussed in more detail in Chapter 2. It was first presented in Fair (1974). The theory 
stresses microfoundations, and in this sense it is consistent with modern macro theory. 
It does not, however, assume that expectations are rational, which is contrary to much 
current practice. It makes a big difference whether or not one assumes that expectations 
are rational. If they are not rational, the Lucas critique is not likely to be a problem, and 
one can follow the Cowles Commission methodology outlined in section 1.2.
The rational expectations (RE) assumption is hard to test and work with empiri­
cally. The widespread use of this assumption has moved macroeconomics away from 
standard econometric estimation toward calibration and matching moments. The work 
in this book follows the Cowles Commission methodology and is thus more empirical 
than much recent macro research: the data play a larger role here in influencing the 
specification of the model. The empirical results in this book do not support some cur­
rent practices. The tests of the RE assumption in Chapter 2 are generally not supportive 
of it. The results discussed in Chapter 7 do not support some of the key properties of 
what is called the “modern-view” model. The results in Chapter 4 do not support the 
dynamics of the NAIRU model.
Advances in computer speeds have greatly expanded the feasibility of using stochas­
tic simulation and bootstrapping. Chapter 9 provides an integration of stochastic sim­
ulation in macroeconomics and bootstrapping in statistics. The availability of these 
techniques allows a way of dealing with possible nonstationarity problems. If some 
variables are not stationary, the standard asymptotic formulas may be poor approxi­
mations of the actual distributions, and in many cases the exact distributions can be 
estimated. Chapter 4 contains an example of this. The working hypothesis in this book 
is that variables are stationary around a deterministic trend. This assumption is not 
tested, but, as just noted, exact distributions are sometimes estimated. Regarding the 
RE assumption, the increase in computer speeds has made it computationally feasible

to analyze even large-scale RE models using stochastic simulation and optimal control 
techniques. This is discussed in Chapter 13, where a large-scale RE model is analyzed.

Estimating How the
Macroeconomy Works

1
Introduction
1.1 Outline of the Book
This book analyzes a number of macroeconomic issues using a multicountry econo­
metric model, denoted the MC model. The methodology followed in the construction 
of the model is discussed in the next section, and the theory behind the model is dis­
cussed in section 1.3. The rest of the chapter then presents the notation that is em­
ployed throughout the book and discusses the main estimation and testing techniques 
that are used.
Chapter 2 is a reference chapter: it and Appendixes A and B present the complete 
MC model. Each stochastic equation in the MC model is tested in a number of ways, and 
the test results are presented in the tables in the appendixes and discussed in Chapter 2. 
One should get a sense from the test results how much confidence to place on the various 
equations.
Section 2.3 presents an overview of the model without details and notation. One can 
read this section and skip the rest of Chapter 2 on first reading. The rest of the chapter 
can be used for reference purposes as the rest of the book is read. Some of the key 
test results, however, are presented in Chapter 2, and one may want to look these over 
on first reading. The results show, for example, little support for the RE assumption. 
Another important result in this chapter concerns the estimated interest rate rule of the 
Fed. The test results discussed in section 2.4.10 show that the equation is stable over 
the entire 1954:1-2002:3 period except for 1979:4-1982:3, when the Fed announced 
that it was targeting monetary aggregates.
Chapter 3 tests the use of nominal versus real interest rates in consumption and 
investment equations. The results strongly support the use of nominal over real interest 
rates in most expenditure equations. These results have implications for the analysis of 
inflation shocks in Chapter 7.
Chapter 4 tests the dynamics of the NAIRU model. The price and wage equa­
tions in the MC model have quite different dynamic properties from those of the 
1

1 || Introduction
NAIRU model, and so it is of interest to test the dynamics. The NAIRU dynam­
ics are generally rejected. An alternative way of thinking about the relationship be­
tween the price level and the unemployment rate is also proposed in Chapter 4, one 
in which there is a highly nonlinear relationship at low values of the unemployment 
rate.
Chapter 5 estimates the size of the wealth effect for the United States. The size of 
the wealth effect is important in Chapter 6 in analyzing the effects of the stock market 
boom in the last half of the 1990s on the economy.
Chapter 6 uses the MC model to examine the question of whether there were 
important structural changes in the U.S. economy in the last half of the 1990s. One of 
the hypotheses tested in Chapter 2 for each stochastic equation is that the coefficients 
have not changed near the end of the sample period. For the United States the end of 
the sample period is from the first quarter of 1995 on, and the only main equation for 
which the hypothesis is rejected is the equation explaining the change in stock prices. In 
other words, the only major structural change in the U.S. economy in the last half of the 
1990s appears to be in the determination of stock prices. An experiment in Chapter 6 
shows that had there not been a stock market boom in the last half of the 1990s (and thus 
no large wealth effect), the U.S. economy would not have looked unusual relative to 
historical experience. All the unusual features appear to be caused by the wealth effect 
from the stock market boom.
Chapter 7 examines a currently popular model in macroeconomics, called here the 
“modern-view” model. In this model a positive inflation shock with the nominal interest 
rate held constant is expansionary. In order for this model to be stable, the coefficient 
on inflation in the nominal interest rate rule must be greater than one. The experiment 
in Chapter 7 shows that a positive inflation shock in the MC model with the nominal 
interest rate held constant is contractionary, not expansionary. The MC model is stable 
even if the coefficient on inflation in the nominal interest rate rule is zero! The modern­
view and MC models thus have quite different monetary policy implications. The use 
of nominal over real interest rates in the MC model, which is discussed in Chapter 3, 
is one reason for the different responses of the two models to an inflation shock. The 
other reasons concern real income and real wealth effects that are in the MC model but 
not the modern-view model.
Chapter 8 estimates what inflation would have been in Europe in the 1980s had the 
Bundesbank followed a more expansionary monetary policy. Although this is not an 
interesting exercise under the dynamics of the NAIRU model, it is of interest under 
the dynamics of the price and wage equations in the MC model. (Remember that 
the dynamics of the NAIRU model are generally rejected in Chapter 4.) The results 
show, for example, that a one-percentage-point fall in the German unemployment rate 
is associated with a less than one-percentage-point increase in the German inflation 
rate.
The rest of the book requires extensive numerical calculations. Chapter 9 dis­
cusses stochastic simulation and bootstrapping. It integrates for the general model 
in this book the bootstrapping approach to evaluating estimators, initiated by Efron

(1979), and the stochastic simulation approach to evaluating models’ properties, initi­
ated by Adelman and Adelman (1959). A Monte Carlo experiment in Chapter 9 shows 
that the bootstrap works well for the U.S. part of the MC model regarding coverage 
accuracy.
Chapter 10 is concerned with the solution of optimal control problems. The standard 
approach to solving optimal control problems for the general model in this book, 
outlined in section 1.7, assumes certainty equivalence (CE). Although this assumption 
is strictly valid only for the case of a linear model and a quadratic objective function, 
the results in Chapter 10 show that the errors introduced by using the CE assumption 
for nonlinear models seem small. This is encouraging because the CE assumption 
allows optimal control problems to be solved that would not be computationally feasible 
otherwise.
Chapter 11 examines the use of policy rules and the solving of optimal control 
problems for their ability to dampen economic fluctuations caused by random shocks. 
Contrary to what would be the case using a modern-view model, even nominal interest 
rate rules with a small or zero coefficient on inflation are stabilizing in the MC model. 
Increasing the coefficient on inflation lowers price variability at a cost of increasing 
interest rate variability. The optimal control procedure with a high weight on inflation 
relative to output in the loss function gives results that are similar to the use of the 
estimated Fed rule mentioned above. The results also show that a tax rate rule could 
help stabilize the economy.
Chapter 12 uses stochastic simulation to examine the stabilization costs to Germany, 
France, Italy, and the Netherlands from joining the European Monetary Union (EMU). 
The estimated costs are conditional on the use of a particular interest rate rule for each 
country before the EMU and a common rule thereafter. Using the estimated rules in the 
MC model, the results show that Germany is hurt the most. France is actually helped by 
joining the EMU because the estimated rule for France is not very stabilizing (the Bank 
of France is estimated to have mostly just followed what the Bundesbank did), whereas 
the EMU rule is partly stabilizing for France. There is a substantial stabilization cost to 
the United Kingdom when it is added to the EMU, and the stabilization cost to Germany 
is even larger if the United Kingdom joins.
Chapter 13 shows that the stochastic simulation and optimal control calcula­
tions in Chapter 11 that were performed to examine policy questions are compu­
tationally feasible for models with rational expectations, even when the models are 
large and nonlinear. Most of the experiments in this book thus do not require that the 
model be a non-RE model like the MC model in order to be computationally feasible. 
The model analyzed in Chapter 13 is one with rational expectations in the bond mar­
ket and where households have rational expecations with respect to future values of 
income.
Chapter 14 compares the accuracy of the U.S. part of the MC model to that of 
simpler, time-series models. The results show that considerable predictive power is 
lost using simpler models.
Chapter 15 summarizes the main conclusions of this study.

1.2 
Methodology
The methodology followed in the construction of the MC model is what is called here 
the “Cowles Commission approach.”1 Theory is used to guide the choice of left-hand­
side and right-hand-side variables for the stochastic equations in the model, and the 
resulting equations are estimated using a consistent estimation technique—two-stage 
least squares (2SLS). In a few cases a restriction is imposed on the coefficients in 
an equation, and the equation is estimated with the restriction imposed. It is never 
the case that all the coefficients in a stochastic equation are chosen ahead of time 
and thus no estimation done: every stochastic equation is estimated. In this sense the 
data rule.
1. See section 1.2 in Fair (1994) for a more detailed discussion of this approach.
2. Evans and Ramey (2003) have shown that in some cases the Lucas critique is a problem even if 
expectations are not rational. These cases are specific to the Evans and Ramey framework, and it is unclear 
how much they can be generalized.
The theory is that households form expectations of their relevant future variable 
values and maximize expected utility. The main choice variables are expenditures and 
labor supply. Similarly, firms form expectations and maximize expected profits. The 
main choice variables are prices, wages, production, investment, employment, and 
dividends. Firms are assumed to behave in a monopolistically competitive environment.
It is assumed that expectations are not rational. Agents are assumed to be forward 
looking in that they form expectations of future values that in turn affect their current 
decisions, but these expectations are not assumed to be rational (model consistent). 
Agents are not assumed to know the complete model. This is not to say, however, that 
expectations of future values are unaffected by current and past values; they are just 
not obtained using predictions from the model. As noted in the previous section, this 
book contains tests of the rational expectations (RE) hypothesis, and in most cases the 
hypothesis is rejected. If expectations are not rational, then the Lucas (1976) critique 
is not likely to be a problem.1 2
The econometric assumption is made that all variables are stationary around a 
deterministic trend. If this assumption is wrong, the estimated asymptotic standard 
errors may be poor approximations to the true standard errors. One way to examine the 
accuracy of asymptotic distributions is to use a bootstrap procedure, which is discussed 
in Chapter 9.
Much of the literature in macroeconomics in the last thirty years has used the RE 
assumption, and much of the literature in time-series econometrics has been concerned 
with nonstationary variables. The previous two paragraphs have thus assumed away a 
huge body of work, and some may want to stop reading here. There is, however, no 
strong evidence in favor of the RE assumption (and some against), and I don’t find 
it plausible that enough people are sophisticated enough for the rational expectations 
assumption to be a good approximation. Regarding the stationarity assumption, it is well 
known that it is difficult to test whether a variable is nonstationary versus stationary

around a deterministic trend, and I don’t see a problem with taking the easier road. 
At worst the estimated standard errors are poor approximations, and the bootstrap 
procedure can help examine this question.
In using theory as it is used in this book, there is much back-and-forth movement 
between specification and estimation. If, for example, a variable or set of variables 
is not significant or a coefficient estimate is of the wrong expected sign, one goes 
back to the specification for possible changes. Because of this, there is always a 
danger of data mining—of finding a statistically significant relationship that is in 
fact spurious. Testing is thus important, and much of this book is concerned with 
testing.
The methodology here is more empirically driven than the use of calibration, which 
is currently popular in macroeconomics. The aim here is to explain the data well 
within the restriction of a fairly broad theoretical framework. In the calibration lit­
erature the stress is more on examining the implications of very specific theoretical 
restrictions; there is only a limited amount of empirical discipline in the specifica­
tion choices. The aim in the calibration literature is not to find the model that best 
explains, say, the quarterly paths of real GDP and inflation, which is the aim of this 
book.
The transition from theory as it is used here to empirical specifications is not 
always straightforward. The quality of the data is never as good as one might like, so 
compromises have to be made. Also, extra assumptions usually have to be made for the 
empirical specifications, in particular about unobserved variables like expectations and 
about dynamics. There usually is, in other words, considerable “theorizing” involved 
in this transition process. There are many examples of this in Chapter 2.

Macro Theory
The “broad theoretical framework” mentioned above that has been used to guide the 
specification of the MC model was first presented in Fair (1974a). It is summarized 
in Fair (1984), Chapter 3, and Fair (1994), Chapter 2. This work stresses three ideas: 
(1) basing macroeconomics on solid microeconomic foundations, (2) allowing for the 
possibility of disequilibrium in some markets, and (3) accounting for all balance-sheet 
and flow of funds constraints. Households and firms make decisions by solving maxi­
mization problems. Households’ decision variables include consumption, labor supply, 
and the demand for money. Firms’ decision variables include production, investment, 
employment, and the demand for money. Firms are assumed to behave in a monopo­
listically competitive environment, and prices and wages are also decision variables of 
firms. The values of prices and wages that firms set are not necessarily market clearing. 
Disequilibrium in the goods markets takes the form of unintended changes in inven­
tories. Disequilibrium in the labor market takes the form of unemployment, where 
households are constrained by firms from working as much as the solutions of their 
unconstrained maximization problems say they want to.

6
1 || Introduction
Di sequilibrium comes about because of expectation errors. In order for a firm to form 
correct (rational)3 expectations, it would have to know the maximization problems of 
all the other firms and of the households. Firms are not assumed to have this much 
knowledge (that is, they do not know the complete model), and so they can make 
expectation errors.
3. The simulation model that has been used to analyze the properties of the theoretical model is 
deterministic, and so rational expectations in this context are perfect foresight expectations.
Tax rates and most government spending variables are exogenous in the model. 
Regarding monetary policy, in the early specification of the theoretical model— 
Fair (1974a)—the amount of government securities outstanding was taken as exoge­
nous, that is, as a policy variable of the monetary authority. In 1978 an estimated interest 
rate rule was added to the empirical version of the model—Fair (1978)—which was 
then added to the discussion of the theoretical model in Fair (1984), Chapter 3. The 
rule is one in which the Fed “leans against the wind,” where the nominal interest rate 
depends positively on the rate of inflation and on output or the unemployment rate.
Interest rate rules are currently quite popular in macroeconomics. They are usually 
referred to as “Taylor rules” from Taylor (1993), although they have a long history. 
The first rule is in Dewaid and Johnson (1963), who regressed the Treasury bill rate on 
the constant, the Treasury bill rate lagged once, real GNP, the unemployment rate, the 
balance-of-payments deficit, and the consumer price index. The next example can be 
found in Christian (1968), followed by many others. These rules should thus probably 
be called Dewald-Johnson rules, since Dewaid and Johnson preceded Taylor by about 
30 years!
Because the model accounts for all flow-of-fund and balance-sheet constraints, 
there is no natural distinction between stock market and flow market determination 
of exchange rates. This distinction played an important role in exchange rate modeling 
in the 1970s. In the model an exchange rate is merely one endogenous variable out of 
many, and in no rigorous sense can it be said to be the variable that clears a particular 
market.
Various properties of the theoretical model are referred to in the specification 
discussion of the empirical model in the next chapter. The reader is referred to the 
earlier references for a detailed discussion of the theoretical model. This discussion is 
not repeated in this book.
1.4 
Notation and 2SLS Estimation
The general model considered in this book is dynamic, nonlinear, and simultaneous:
fityt’ yt-b • • • , yt-p, xt, = uit, i = 
(1.1)
where yt is an n-dimensional vector of endogenous variables, xt is a vector of exogenous 
variables, and az is a vector of coefficients. The first m equations are assumed to be 

1.5 || Testing Single Equations
7
stochastic, with the remaining equations identities. The vector of error terms, ut — 
(uit, . . . , umty, is assumed to be iid. The function may be nonlinear in variables 
and coefficients. The T-dimensional vector (w;1, . . . , ttiT)f will be denoted u,.
This specification is fairly general. It includes as a special case the VAR model. It 
also incorporates autoregressive errors. If the original error term in equation i follows 
an rth-order autoregressive process, say wit — PyWit_\ + • • • + priwit_r + uit, then 
equation i in model 1.1 can be assumed to have been transformed into one with uit 
on the right-hand side. The autoregressive coefficients py, ..., prj are incorporated 
into the cq coefficient vector, and additional lagged variable values are introduced. This 
transformation makes the equation nonlinear in coefficients if it were not otherwise, but 
this adds no further complications because the model is already allowed to be nonlinear. 
The assumption that ut is iid is thus not as restrictive as it would be if the model were 
required to be linear in coefficients.
Although it is not assumed that expectations are rational in the MC model, some of 
the work in this book uses the RE assumption. For a model with rational expectations, 
the notation is:4
4. The treatment of autoregressive errors is more complicated in the RE model because it introduces 
more than one viewpoint date. This is discussed in Fair and Taylor (1983, 1990).
fi(yt> yt-\^ • • • ■> y't—py Et-vyt
*
 -^t—i^+b • • • ■> ^t—iyt+h^
i = i,... ,n, t = i,..., T,
where Et_{ is the conditional expectations operator based on the model and on infor­
mation through period t — 1. The function fi may be nonlinear in variables, parameters, 
and expectations.
For the non-RE model 1.1, the 2SES estimate of is obtained by minimizing
(1.3)
with respect to ah where Zz is a T x Kt matrix of first-stage regressors. When a 
stochastic equation for a country is estimated by 2SES in this book, the first-stage 
regressors are the main predetermined variables for the country. The predetermined 
variables are assumed to be correlated with the right-hand-side endogenous variables 
in the equation but not with the error term.
The estimation of RE models is discussed in the next section under the discussion 
of leads. The solution of RE models is discussed in section 13.3. Although RE models 
are considerably more costly to solve in terms of computer time, Chapter 13 shows that 
both optimal control and stochastic simulation are computationally feasible for such 
models.
1.5 Testing Single Equations
Each of the stochastic equations of the MC model has been tested in a number of ways. 
The following is a brief outline of these tests.

8
1 || Introduction
1.5.1 Chi-Square Tests
Many single-equation tests are simply of the form of adding a variable or a set of 
variables to an equation and testing whether the addition is statistically significant. 
Let S**  denote the value of the minimand before the addition, let S*  denote the value 
after the addition, and let denote the estimated variance of the error term after the 
addition. Under fairly general conditions, as discussed in Andrews and Fair (1988), 
(S
**  — S*)/0n
 is distributed as /2 with k degrees of freedom, where k is the number 
of variables added. For the 2SLS estimator the minimand is defined in equation 1.3. 
Possible applications of the x2 test are the following.
5. See Chow (1968) for an early analysis of the acceleration principle.
Dynamic Specification
Many macroeconomic equations include the lagged dependent variable and other 
lagged endogenous variables among the explanatory variables. A test of the dynamic 
specification of a particular equation is to add further lagged values to the equation and 
see if they are significant. If, for example, in an equation ylt is explained by y2t, yzt-i, 
andxlt_2, then the variables added are ylf_b y2r-b 
and xu~3- If in addition
is an explanatory variable, then yit_2 is added. Hendry, Pagan, and Sargan (1984) show 
that adding these lagged values is quite general in that it encompasses many different 
types of dynamic specifications. Therefore, adding the lagged values and testing for 
their significance is a test against a fairly general dynamic specification. This test is 
called the “lags” test in Chapter 2.
The lags test also concerns the acceleration principle.5 If, for example, the level 
of income is specified as an explanatory variable in an expenditure equation, but the 
correct specification is the change in income, then when lagged income is added as an 
explanatory variable with the current level of income included, the lagged value should 
be significant. If the lagged value is not significant, this is evidence against the use of 
the change in income.
Time Trend
Long before unit roots and cointegration became popular, model builders worried about 
picking up spurious correlation from common trending variables. One check on whether 
the correlation might be spurious is to add the time trend to the equation. If adding the 
time trend to the equation substantially changes some of the coefficient estimates, this 
is cause for concern. A simple test is to add the time trend to the equation and test if 
this addition is significant. This test is called the “T” test in Chapter 2.
Serial Correlation of the Error Term
As noted in section 1.4, if the error term in an equation follows an autoregressive 
process, the equation can be transformed and the coefficients of the autoregressive 

1.5 || Testing Single Equations
9
process can be estimated along with the structural coefficients. Even if, say, a first- 
order process has been assumed and the first-order coefficient estimated, it is still of 
interest to see if there is serial correlation of the (transformed) error term. This can be 
done by assuming a more general process for the error term and testing its significance. 
If, for example, the addition of a second-order process over a first-order process results 
in a significant increase in explanatory power, this is evidence that the serial correlation 
properties of the error term have not been properly accounted for. This test is called the 
“RHO” test in Chapter 2.
Leads (Rational Expectations)
Adding values led one or more periods and using Hansen’s (1982) method for the 
estimation is a way of testing the hypothesis that expectations are rational. The test 
of the RE hypothesis is to add variable values led one or more periods to an equation 
and estimate the resulting equation using Hansen’s method. If the led values are not 
significant, this is evidence against the RE hypothesis.
For example, say that Et_iy2t+i and Et_{y2t+2 are postulated to be explanatory 
variables in the first equation in model 1.2, where the expectations are assumed to be 
rational. If it is assumed that variables in a matrix Zz are used in part by agents in forming 
their (rational) expectations, then Hansen’s method in this context is simply 2SLS with 
adjustment for the moving-average process of the error term. The expectations variables 
are replaced by the actual values y2t+1 and y2t+2^ and the first-stage regressors are the 
variables in Zt. Consistent estimation does not require that Zz include all the variables 
used by agents in forming their expectations. The requirement for consistency is that 
Zz be uncorrelated with the expectation errors, which is true if expectations are rational 
and Zz is at least a subset of the variables used by the agents.6
6. For more details, including the case in which uit in model 1.2 is serially correlated, see Fair (1993b) 
or Fair (1994), pp. 65-70.
If the coefficient estimates of y2r+i and J2r+2 are insignificant, this is evidence 
against the RE hypothesis. For the “leads” tests in Chapter 2, three sets of led values 
are tried per equation. For the first set the values of the relevant variables led once are 
added; for the second set the values led one through four quarters are added; and for 
the third set the values led one through eight quarters are added, where the coefficients 
for each variable are constrained to lie on a second-degree polynomial with an end­
point constraint of zero. The test in each case is a %2 test that the additional variables 
are significant. The three tests are called “Leads +1,” “Leads +4,” and “Leads +8.”
1.5.2 AP Stability Test
A useful stability test is the Andrews and Ploberger (AP) (1994) test. It does not require 
that the date of the structural change be chosen a priori. If the overall sample period 
is 1 through T, the hypothesis tested is that a structural change occurred between 

10
1 || Introduction
observations I\ and T2, where I\ is an observation close to 1 and T2 is an observation 
close to T.
The particular AP test used in this book is as follows.
1. Compute the x  value for the hypothesis that the change occurred at observation 
Tp This requires estimating the equation three times—once each for the estimation 
periods 1 through 7) — 1, 7) through T, and 1 through T. Denote this value as x2(1\
2
7
2. Repeat step 1 for the hypothesis that the change occurred at observation I\ + 1. 
Denote this x  value as %2(2\ Keep doing this through the hypothesis that the 
change occurred at observation T2. This results in N — T2 — T\ + 1 x  values being 
computed—x2(1\ . . . , X2('V)-
2
2
3. The Andrews-Ploberger test statistic (denoted AP) is
7. When the 2SLS estimator is used, this x2 value is computed as follows. Let S-l) be the value of the 
minimand in equation 1.3 for the first estimation period, and let 5) be the value for the second estimation 
period. Define S* = 5® + S-2\ Let S** be the value of the minimand in 1.3 when the equation is estimated 
over the full estimation period. When estimating over the full period, the Zz matrix used for the full period 
must be the union of the matrices used for the two subperiods in order to make S** comparable to S*. This 
means that for each first-stage regressor zit two variables must be used in Z, for the full estimation period, 
one that is equal to zit for the first subperiod and zero otherwise and one that is equal to zit for the second 
subperiod and zero otherwise. The x2 value is then (S** — S*)/au, where a-a is equal to the sum of the 
sums of squared residuals from the first and second estimation periods divided by T — 2&z, where &z is the 
number of estimated coefficients in the equation.
AP = log[(e5/2(1) + • • • + 
(1.4)
In words, the AP statistic is a weighted average of the x2 values, where there is 
one x2 value for each possible split in the sample period between observations 7\ 
and T2.
Asymptotic critical values for AP are presented in Tables I and II in Andrews 
and Ploberger (1994). The critical values depend on the number of coefficients in the 
equation and on a parameter k, where in the present context k = [tt2(1 — TrOl/Du(1 — 
7T2)], where — (7) — S)/T and tt2 — (^2 — -5)/T.
If the AP value is significant, it may be of interest to examine the individual x2 
values to see where the maximum value occurred. This is likely to give one a general 
idea of where the structural change occurred even though the AP test does not reveal 
this in any rigorous way.
In Chapter 2 three AP tests are computed for each stochastic equation for the 
United States corresponding to three different pairs of 7), T2 values: 1970.1, 1979.4; 
1975.1, 1984.4; and 1980.1, 1989.4. One AP test is computed for each of the other 
stochastic equations (for the other countries), with T\ 40 quarters or 10 years after the 
first observation and T2 40 quarters or 10 years before the last observation. A * is put 
before the AP value if the value is significant at the 99 percent confidence level. The 
null hypothesis is that there is no structural change.

1.5 || Testing Single Equations
11
Dummy variables that take on a value of 1.0 during certain quarters or years and 0.0 
otherwise appear in a few of the stochastic equations of the MC model. For example, 
there are four dummy variables in the U.S. import equation that are, respectively, 1.0 
in 1969:1, 1969:2, 1971:4, and 1972:1 and 0.0 otherwise. These are meant to pick up 
effects of two dock strikes. A dummy variable coefficient obviously cannot be estimated 
for sample periods in which the dummy variable is always zero. This rules out the use of 
the AP test if some of the sample periods that are used in the test have all zero values for 
at least one dummy variable. To get around this problem when performing the test, all 
dummy variable coefficients were taken to be fixed and equal to their estimates based 
on the entire sample period. This was also done for the end-of-sample stability test 
discussed next.
1.5.3 End-of-Sample Stability Test
As mentioned above, some consider that the U.S. economy entered a new age in the 
1990s. An interesting test of this is to test the hypothesis that the coefficients in the U.S. 
stochastic equations differ, say, beginning about 1995. Consider the null hypothesis 
that the coefficients in an equation are the same over the entire 1954:1-2002:3 period. 
The alternative hypothesis is that the coefficients are different before and after 1995:1. 
There are 195 total observations and 31 observations from 1995:1 on. If the potential 
break point were earlier in the sample period, the methods in Andrews and Fair (1988) 
could be used to test the hypothesis. These methods cover the 2SLS estimator. However, 
given that there are only 31 observations after the potential break point, these methods 
are not practical because the number of first-stage regressors is close to the number 
of observations. In other words, it is not practical to estimate the equations using only 
observations for the 1995:1-2002:3 period, which the methods require.
The end-of-sample stability test developed in Andrews (2003) can be used when 
there are fewer observations after the potential break point than regressors. The test 
used in this book is what Andrews calls the Ph test. In the present context this test is as 
follows (again, the estimation method is 2SLS):
1. Estimate the equation to be tested over the whole period 1954:1-2002:3 (195 
observations). Let d denote the sum of squared residuals from this regression for 
the 1995:1-2002:3 period (31 observations).
2. Consider 134 different subsets of the basic 1954:1-1994:4 sample period. For 
the first subset estimate the equation using observations 16-164, and use these 
coefficient estimates to compute the sum of squared residuals for the 1-31 period. 
Let d\ denote this sum of squared residuals. For the second subset estimate the 
equation using observations 1 and 17-164, and use these coefficient estimates to 
compute the sum of squared residuals for the 2-32 period. Let d2 denote this 
sum of squared residuals. For the last (134th) subset estimate the equation using 
observations 1-133 and 149-164, and use these coefficient estimates to compute 
the sum of squared residuals for the 134-164 period. Let d134 denote this sum of 
squared residuals. Then sort dj by size (z = 1, . . . , 134).

12
1 || Introduction
3. Observe where d falls within the distribution of dt. If, say, d exceeds 95 percent of 
the dt values and a 95 percent confidence level is being used, then the hypothesis 
of stability is rejected. The /2-value is simply the percentage of the dt values that lie 
above d.
Note in step 2 that each of the 134 sample periods used to estimate the coefficients 
includes half (rounded up) of the observations for which the sum of squared residuals 
is computed. This choice is ad hoc, but a fairly natural finite sample adjustment. The 
adjustment works well in Andrews’s simulations.
In Chapter 2 one end-of-sample test is computed for each stochastic equation. For 
the United States the end period is 1995.1-2002.3. For the other countries the end period 
usually begins twelve quarters or three years before the last observation. In Chapter 6 
the end-of-sample test is also computed for each stochastic equation for the United 
States for the end period 1995:1-2000:4.
1.5.4 Test of Overidentifying Restrictions
A common test of overidentifying restrictions when using 2SLS is to regress the 2SUS 
residuals, denoted on Z, and compute the R2. Then T • R2 is distributed as %2, 
where q is the number of variables in Z, minus the number of explanatory variables in 
the equation being estimated.8 The null hypothesis is that all the first-stage regressors are 
uncorrelated with ut. If T • R2 exceeds the specified critical value, the null hypothesis 
is rejected, and one would conclude that at least some of the first-stage regressors are 
not predetermined. This test is denoted “overid” in the tables discussed in Chapter 2.
8. See Wooldridge (2000), pp. 484-485, for a clear discussion of this.
1.5.5 Confidence Levels and Response to Rejections
Unless stated otherwise, a hypothesis will be said to be rejected if the p-value for the 
test is less than .01. If a hypothesis is not rejected, the test will be said to have been 
“passed.” For example, if a leads test is passed, this means that the led values are not 
significant, which is a rejection of the RE hypothesis. A coefficient estimate will be 
said to be significant if its /-statistic is greater than 2.0 in absolute value. A variable 
will be said to be significant if its coefficient estimate is significant.
It will be seen in Chapter 2 that a number of tests are not passed. If an equation 
does not pass a test, it is not always clear what should be done. If, for example, the 
hypothesis of structural stability is rejected, one possibility is to divide the sample 
period into two parts and estimate two separate equations. If this is done, however, 
the resulting coefficient estimates are not always sensible in terms of what one would 
expect from theory. Similarly, when the additional lagged values are significant, the 
equation with the additional lagged values does not always have what one would 
consider sensible dynamic properties. In other words, when an equation fails a test, 
the change in the equation that the test results suggest may not produce what seem 

1.6 || Testing Complete Models
13
to be sensible results. In many cases, the best choice seems to be to stay with the 
original equation even though it failed the test. Some of this difficulty may be due 
to small-sample problems, which will lessen over time as sample sizes increase. This 
is an important area for future work and is what makes macroeconomics interesting. 
Obviously less confidence should be placed on equations that fail a number of the tests 
than on those that do not.
1.6 
Testing Complete Models
Once the cq- coefficients in model 1.1 have been estimated, the model can be solved. 
For a deterministic simulation the error terms uit are set to zero. A dynamic simulation 
is one in which the predicted values of the endogenous variables for past periods are 
used as values for the lagged endogenous variables when solving for the current period. 
The solution technique for nonlinear models is usually the Gauss-Seidel technique.9
9. See Fair (1984), Chapter 7, for a discussion of the use of the Gauss-Seidel technique in the present 
context.
One widely used measure of fit is root mean squared error (RMSE). Let yit denote 
the predicted value of endogenous variable i for period t. If the solution period is 1 
through S, the RMSE is:
RMSE,- 
- yit)2. 
(1.5)
\ 5 r=l
There are a number of potential problems in using the RMSE criterion to compare 
different models. One potential problem is data mining, where much specification 
searching may have been done to obtain good fits. In this case RMSEs may be low 
because of the searching and may not be an adequate reflection of how well the model 
has approximated the economy. One answer to this is to compute RMSEs for periods 
outside the estimation period, where less searching is likely to have been done. An even 
better answer is, data permitting, to compute RMSEs for periods that were not known 
at the time of the specification and estimation of the model.
Another potential problem is that models may be based on different sets of exoge­
nous variables. One model may have lower RMSEs than another simply because it takes 
more variables to be exogenous. One answer to this is to estimate autoregressive equa­
tions for the exogenous variables and add these equations to the model, which produces 
a model with no exogenous variables. RMSEs from the expanded models can then be 
compared.
It may be that one model has lower RMSEs than another but that the predictions from 
both models have independent information. The procedure in Fair and Shiller (1990), 
denoted the “FS method” in this book, can be used to examine this question. The 
procedure is to regress (over the prediction period) the actual value of a variable on 

14
1 || Introduction
the constant term and predictions from two or more models. If one model’s predic­
tion has all the information in it that the other predictions have plus some, then its 
coefficient estimate should be significant and the others not. If, on the other hand, all 
the predictions have independent information, all the coefficient estimates should be 
significant.
Coming back to RMSEs, they are not in general estimates of prediction error vari­
ances, because these variances generally vary across time. Prediction error variances 
vary across time because of nonlinearities in the model, because of variation in the ex­
ogenous variables, and because of variation in the initial conditions. This problem can 
be handled by using stochastic simulation to estimate variances. A stochastic simula­
tion requires many solutions of the model, where each solution is based on a particular 
draw of the uit error terms in model 1.1. Stochastic simulation is used in this book 
beginning with Chapter 9. Chapter 14 is concerned with comparing different mod­
els using RMSEs and the FS method and with estimating variation using stochastic 
simulation.
1.7 
Solving Optimal Control Problems
For some of the work in this book optimal control problems need to be solved using 
model 1.1. Under the assumption of certainty equivalence, a useful technique is as 
follows.
Assume that the period of interest is 5 through S and that the objective is to maximize 
the expected value of W subject to the model 1.1, where W is
s
w = 
(1-6)
t=s
Let zf be the vector of control variables, where zt is a subset of xt, and let z be 
the vector of all the control values: z = (zs, . . . , zs). Under the CE assumption, the 
control problem is solved at the beginning of period 5 by setting the errors for period 
5 and beyond equal to zero. If this is done, then for each value of z one can compute 
a value of W by first solving the model for ys, . . . , ys and then using these values 
along with the values for xs, . . . , xs to compute W in equation 1.6. Stated this way, 
the optimal control problem is choosing variables (the elements of z) to maximize 
an unconstrained nonlinear function. By substitution, the constrained maximization 
problem is transformed into the problem of maximizing an unconstrained function of 
the control variables:
W - O(z), 
(1.7)
where <I> stands for the mapping z —> ys, . . ., ys, xs, . . ., xs —> W. Given this setup, 
the problem can be turned over to a nonlinear optimization algorithm like Davidon- 
Fletcher-Powell (DFP). For each iteration of the algorithm, the derivatives of with 
respect to the elements of z, which are needed by the algorithm, can be computed

numerically. An algorithm like DFP is generally quite good at finding the optimum for 
a typical control problem.10
10. See Fair (1974b) for various applications of this procedure. See also Fair (1984), section 2.5, for a 
discussion of the DFP algorithm.
Let z*  be the computed optimal value of zs. This is the value that would be im­
plemented for period 5 by the control authority. Although the control problem also 
calculates the optimal values for periods s + 1 through S, in practice these would never 
have to be implemented because a new problem could be solved at the beginning of 
period 5 + 1 after period 5 was realized. This is the “open-loop feedback” approach. 
Chapter 10 examines the sensitivity of optimal control results to the use of the CE 
assumption.
1.8 
The FP Program and the Website
All the calculations in this book have been done using the Fair-Parke (FP) program 
(2003). The first version of this program was available in 1980, and it has been expanded 
over time. See Fair (1984), Appendix C, for a discussion of the logic of the program. 
One of the advantages of the program is that it allows the user to move easily from the 
estimation of individual equations to the solution and analysis of the entire model.
The Fair-Parke program can be downloaded from the website http://fairmodel.econ 
.yale.edu. The datasets for the US model and for the overall MC model that are used by 
the FP program can also be downloaded. With these datasets and the FP program, all 
the calculations in this book can be duplicated. One can also work with the US and MC 
models online. Although estimation and stochastic simulation cannot be done online, 
many of the experiments in this book can be duplicated online.

2.1 
The Model in Tables
This is a reference chapter for the MC model. This section outlines the presentation 
of the model in tables, and the next section discusses the treatment of expectations. 
Section 2.3 then gives a general overview of the model. Sections 2.4 and 2.5 discuss 
the model in detail and can be skipped on first reading.
There are 39 countries in the MC model for which stochastic equations are estimated. 
The countries are listed in Table B.l in Appendix B. There are 31 stochastic equations 
for the United States and up to 15 each for the other countries. The total number of 
stochastic equations is 362, and the total number of estimated coefficients is 1,646. 
In addition, there are 1,111 estimated trade share equations. The total number of 
endogenous and exogenous variables, not counting various transformations of the 
variables and the trade share variables, is about 2,000. Trade share data were collected 
for 59 countries, and so the trade share matrix is 59 x 59.
The estimation periods begin in 1954 for the United States and as soon after 
1960 as data permit for the other countries. They end between 1998 and 2002. The 
estimation technique is 2SLS except when there are too few observations to make the 
technique practical, where ordinary least squares is used. The estimation accounts for 
possible serial correlation of the error terms. The variables used for the first-stage 
regressors for a country are the main predetermined variables in the model for the 
country.
There is a mixture of quarterly and annual data in the model. Quarterly equations 
are estimated for 14 countries, and annual equations are estimated for the remaining 
25. However, all the trade share equations are quarterly. There are quarterly data on 
all the variables that feed into the trade share equations, namely the exchange rate, the 
local currency price of exports, and the total value of imports per country. When the 
model is solved, the predicted annual values of these variables for the annual countries 
are converted to predicted quarterly values using a simple distribution assumption. The
16

2.1 || The Model in Tables
17
quarterly predicted values from the trade share equations are converted to annual values 
by summation or averaging when this is needed. The solution of the MC model is 
explained in section B.6 in Appendix B.
For ease of reference the United States part of the overall MC model is denoted 
the “US” model and the remaining part is denoted the “ROW” model. The ROW 
model consists of the individual models of all the other countries. Also, all the equa­
tions that pertain to the links among countries, such as the trade share equations, 
are put in the ROW model. There are 30 stochastic equations for the US model 
alone and 1 additional equation when the US model is imbedded in the overall MC 
model.
The discussion of the model in sections 2.4 and 2.5 relies heavily on the tables in 
Appendixes A and B. All the variables and equations in the US model are presented 
in Appendix A. Table A.l lists the six sectors of the model, and Table A.2 lists all 
the variables in alphabetical order. All the equations, both the stochastic equations and 
the identities, are listed in Table A.3, but not the coefficient estimates. The coefficient 
estimates and test results are presented in Table A.4 for the 30 stochastic equations. 
Within Table A.4, Table Al refers to equation 1, Table A2 refers to equation 2, and so 
on through Table A30.
The remaining tables in Appendix A are for completeness. They allow the model 
to be reproduced by someone else. These tables can be skipped if desired. Table A.5 
lists the “raw data” variables, that is, the variables for which data were collected. 
Table A.6 shows the links using the raw data variables between the national income 
and product accounts (NIPA) and the flow of funds accounts (FFA). Table A.7 shows 
how the variables in the model were constructed from the raw data variables. Table A.8 
shows how the model is solved under alternative assumptions about monetary policy. 
Table A.9 lists the first-stage regressors used for each equation for the 2SLS estimator. 
Finally, Table A. 10 shows which variables appear in which equations. It is useful for 
tracking the effects of various variables.
Appendix B does for the ROW model what Appendix A does for the US model. 
Table B.l lists the countries in the model, and Table B.2 lists all the variables for 
a given country in alphabetical order Table B.2 also shows how each variable in the 
model is constructed from the data. All the equations, both the stochastic equations and 
the identities, are listed in Table B.3, but not the coefficient estimates. The coefficient 
estimates and test results are presented in Table B.4 for the stochastic equations. 
There are up to 15 equations per country, and within Table B.4, Table Bl refers to 
equation 1, Table B2 refers to equation 2, and so on through Table B15. Table B.5 
shows the links between the US and ROW models, and Table B.6 shows how the 
balance-of-payments data were used. There are a few other versions of the US model 
from the one presented in Appendix A, and these versions are discussed as they are 
used.
In presenting the stochastic equations in this chapter, et is used to denote the error 
term in the equation. Sometimes [jLt is also used. The t subscript is sometimes dropped 
when there is no confusion about the time period.

2.2 
Treatment of Expectations
It will be seen that lagged dependent variables are used as explanatory variables in 
many of the equations. They are generally highly significant even after accounting for 
any autoregressive properties of the error terms. It is well known that lagged dependent 
variables can be accounting for either partial adjustment effects or expectational effects 
and that it is difficult to identify the two effects separately.1 For the most part no attempt 
is made in the empirical work in this book to separate the two effects. The rational 
expectations assumption is, however, tested in the manner discussed in section 1.5. 
Since most of the equations are estimated by 2SLS, one can also think of the predicted 
values from the first-stage regressions as representing the predictions of the agents if 
it is assumed that agents know the values of the first-stage regressors at the time they 
make their decisions.
For some of the tests specific measures of expectations are used. For example, 
two measures of inflationary expectations that are used are p^ = (Pt/Pt_^) — 1 and 
p% — (Pt/Pt_%)'5 — 1, where Pt is the price level in quarter t.
2.3 
An Overview of the Model
Because of the MC model’s size, it is difficult to get a big picture of how it works. In 
this section an attempt is made to give an overview of the model for a given country 
without getting bogged down in details and notation. The model for the United States 
is more detailed than the models for the other countries, and the discussion in this 
section pertains only to the models for the other countries. Table 2.1 is used as a 
framework for discussion. The table outlines for a given country how thirteen variables 
are determined. The first seven (consumption, investment, imports, domestic price 
level, short-term interest rate, exchange rate, and export price level) are determined 
by estimated equations; the next two (import price level and exports) are determined 
when all the countries are linked together; and the last four (output, current account, 
net assets, and world price level) are determined by identities.
Unless otherwise stated, the price levels are prices in local currency. Consumption, 
investment, imports, exports, and output are in real (local currency) terms. The ex­
change rate is local currency per U.S. dollar, so an increase in the exchange rate is a 
depreciation of the currency relative to the dollar.
The following discussion ignores dynamic issues. In most estimated equations there 
is a lagged dependent variable among the explanatory variables to pick up partial 
adjustment and/or expectational effects, but these variables are not listed in the table. 
Inventory investment is not discussed; the labor sector is not discussed; the interaction 
between prices and wages is not discussed; and the relationship between the short-term 
and long-term interest rate is not discussed. Finally, in terms of what is not discussed, 
it should be kept in mind that not every effect exists for every country.

The seven variables determined by estimated equations in Table 2.1 are:
1. Consumption depends on income, an interest rate, and wealth. Wealth is the net 
assets of the country vis-a-vis the rest of the world. The interest rate is either the 
short rate or the long rate. Monetary policy thus has a direct effect on consumption 
through the interest rate variables.
2. Investment depends on output and an interest rate. As with consumption, monetary 
policy has a direct effect on investment through the interest rate variables.

20
2 || The MC Model
3. The level of imports depends on consumption plus investment plus government 
spending, on the domestic price level, and on the import price level. The price 
variables are important in this equation. If, for example, the import price level rises 
relative to the domestic price level, this has a negative effect on import demand. A 
depreciation of the country’s currency thus lowers the demand for imports because 
it increases the import price level.
4. The domestic price level depends on output and the import price level, where output 
is meant to represent some measure of demand pressure. The import price level 
is a key variable in this equation. It is significant for almost all countries. When 
the import price level rises, this has a positive effect on the prices of domestically 
produced goods. This is the main channel through which a depreciation of the 
country’s currency affects the domestic price level.
5. The short-term interest rate depends on output and the rate of inflation. The 
estimated equation for the interest rate is interpreted as an interest rate rule of the 
monetary authority. The estimated interest rate rules for the various countries are 
“leaning against the wind” equations. Other things being equal, an increase in output 
or an increase in the rate of inflation leads to an increase in the interest rate.
6. The exchange rate depends on the short-term interest rate and the domestic price 
level. All the explanatory variables are relative to the respective U.S. variables if 
the exchange rate is relative to the dollar and are relative to the respective German 
variables if the exchange rate is relative to the DM. A depreciation of a country’s 
currency occurs if there is a relative decrease in the country’s interest rate or a relative 
increase in the country’s price level.
7. The export price level in local currency is determined as a weighted average of the 
domestic price level and a world price level converted to local currency, where the 
weight is estimated. If the weight on the world price level converted to local currency 
is one (and thus the weight on the domestic price level is zero), the country is a 
complete price taker on world markets. In this case, if the world price level in dollars 
is little affected by the individual country, then a depreciation of a country’s currency 
of a given percentage increases the export price level in local currency by roughly the 
same percentage (since the world price level converted to local currency increases 
by roughly the same percentage), leaving the export price level in dollars roughly 
unchanged. Otherwise, the export price level in dollars falls with a depreciation, 
where the size of the fall depends on the estimated weight in the equation.
The next two variables in Table 2.1 are determined when the countries are linked 
together.
8. The import price level in local currency for a given country i depends on its dollar 
exchange rate and other countries’ export prices in dollars. The import price level is 
a weighted average of all other countries’ export prices converted to local currency, 
with a weight for a particular country j being the amount imported by i from j as a 

2.3 || An Overview of the Model
21
fraction of z’s total imports. If there is a depreciation of z’s currency and no change 
in the other countries’ export prices in their own local currency, then the import 
price level in local currency will rise by the full percentage of the depreciation.
9. The total level of exports for a given country i is the sum of its exports to all the 
other countries. The amount that country i exports to country j is determined by 
the trade share equations. The share of j’s total imports imported from i depends 
on z’s export price level in dollars relative to a weighted average of all the other 
countries’ export price levels in dollars. The higher is i’s relative export price level, 
the lower is z’s share of j’s total imports. There are 1,111 estimated trade share 
equations. Many estimated equations are thus involved in determining the response 
of a country’s total exports to a change in its export price level.
The four identities in Table 2.1 are straightforward. They determine, respectively, 
output, the current account, net assets, and the world price level.
2.3.1 Effects of a Depreciation
Table 2.1 can be used to trace through the effects of a depreciation of a country’s 
currency. This will be useful for understanding the experiment in Chapter 8. Assume 
that there is an exogenous depreciation of a country’s currency. The depreciation raises 
the import price level in local currency. The increase in the import price level then has 
two main effects, other things being equal. The first is that the demand for imports falls 
(equation 3), and the second is that the domestic price level rises (equation 4). (All 
the equation references in the rest of this section are to the equations in Table 2.1.) 
The depreciation also reduces the price of exports in dollars unless the country is a 
complete price taker (equation 7). The decrease in the price of exports in dollars leads 
to an increase in the demand for the country’s exports (equation 9). The depreciation is 
thus expansionary and inflationary: the level of imports falls, the level of exports rises, 
and the domestic price level increases. The effect on the current account is ambiguous 
because of the usual “J-curve” reasons.
2.3.2 Effects of an Interest Rate Decrease
Table 2.1 can also be used to trace through the effects of a decrease in a country’s interest 
rate. Assume that there is an exogenous decrease in a country’s interest rate. This leads, 
other things being equal, to an increase in consumption and investment (equations 1 
and 2). It also leads to a depreciation of the country’s currency (equation 6), which has 
the effects discussed above. In particular, exports increase (equation 9). The effect on 
aggregate demand in the country from the interest rate decrease is thus positive from 
the increase in consumption, investment, and exports.
There are two main effects on imports, one positive and one negative (equation 3). 
The positive effect is that consumption and investment are higher, some of which is 
imported. The negative effect is that the price of imports is higher because of the 

22
2 || The MC Model
depreciation, which has a negative effect on the demand for imports. The net effect 
on imports can thus go either way.
There is also a positive effect on the price level. As noted above, the depreciation 
leads to an increase in the price of imports (equation 8). This in turn has a positive effect 
on the domestic price level (equation 4). In addition, if aggregate demand increases, this 
increases demand pressure, which has a positive effect on the domestic price level (also 
equation 4).
There are other effects that follow from these, including effects back on the short­
term interest rate itself through the interest rate rule (equation 5), but these are typically 
second order in nature, especially in the short run. The main effects are as just described. 
The decrease in a country’s interest rate should thus stimulate the economy, depreciate 
the currency, and lead to a rise in its price level.
This completes the general overview. The next two sections discuss the exact 
specifications.
2.4 The US Stochastic Equations
2.4.1 Introduction
The methodology that was followed in the specification and estimation of the stochastic 
equations is discussed in section 1.2. The estimates that are presented in Tables Al 
through A30 (within Table A.4 in Appendix A) are those of the “final” specifications. 
Lagged dependent variables are generally used as explanatory variables to account for 
expectational and/or partial adjustment effects. Explanatory variables were dropped if 
they had highly insignificant coefficient estimates or estimates of the wrong expected 
sign. Most of the equations are estimated by 2SLS. The equations were first estimated 
under the assumption of a first-order autoregressive error term, and the assumption was 
retained if the estimate of the autoregressive coefficient was significant. In a few cases 
higher-order processes are used.
The x2 tests per equation are (1) adding lagged values of all the variables in the 
equation, (2) estimating the equation under the assumption of a/bm/z-ordcr autore­
gressive process for the error term, (3) adding the time trend, and (4) adding values led 
one or more quarters. The other tests are (5) testing for structural stability using the AP 
test, (6) testing for structural stability using the end-of-sample test, and (7) testing the 
overidentifying restrictions. The basic estimation period is 1954:1-2002:3, for a total 
of 195 observations.
In the discussion of the US stochastic equations in this section, no mention will be 
made of the results in the tables regarding the overidentifying tests. For all the equations 
the /7-values are greater than .01, and so the null hypothesis that the first-stage regressors 
are uncorrelated with the error term in the equation is never rejected. Nor is any mention 
made of the results of the end-of-sample tests. These tests are discussed in Chapter 6. 
For only 3 of the 30 equations in Tables A1-A30 is the p-value for the end-of-sample 
test less than .01.

2.4 || The US Stochastic Equations
23
The “broad theoretical framework” that is used to guide the specification of the 
stochastic equations was discussed in section 1.3. This framework will be called the 
“theoretical model.”
The notation for the six sectors in the US model is presented in Table A. 1. It is h for 
households, f for firms, b for financial, r for foreign, g for federal government, and s 
for state and local governments.
2.4.2 Household Expenditure and Labor Supply Equations
The two main decision variables of a household in the theoretical model are consump­
tion and labor supply. The determinants of these variables include the initial value of 
wealth and the current and expected future values of the wage rate, the price level, the 
interest rate, the tax rate, the level of transfer payments, and a possible labor constraint.
In the econometric model the expenditures of the household sector are disaggregated 
into four types: consumption of services, CS; consumption of nondurable goods, CN; 
consumption of durable goods, CD; and residential investment, IHH. Four labor supply 
variables are used: the labor force of men aged 25-54, LI; the labor force of women 
aged 25-54, L2; the labor force of all others aged 16+, L3; and the number of 
people holding more than one job, called “moonlighters,” LM. These eight variables 
are determined by eight estimated equations.
Real after-tax income, YD/PH, is used as an explanatory variable in the expenditure 
equations, which implicitly assumes that the labor constraint is always binding on 
the household sector. In an earlier version of the model—Fair (1984)—a real wage 
rate variable and a labor constraint variable were used instead of YD/PH. The labor 
constraint variable was constructed to be zero or nearly zero in tight labor markets and 
to increase as labor markets loosen. The “classical” case is when the labor constraint 
is zero, where expenditures depend on the real wage rate. The “Keynesian” case is 
when labor markets are loose and the labor constraint variable is not zero. In this case 
the labor constraint variable is correlated with hours paid for, and so having both the 
real wage rate and the labor constraint variable in the equation is similar to having a 
real labor income variable in the equation. Tests of these two specifications generally 
support the use of YD/PH over the real wage rate and the labor constraint variable, and 
so YD/PH has been used. This does not necessarily mean, however, that the classical 
case never holds in practice. It may be that the use of the labor constraint variable is 
not an adequate way to try to account for the classical case. This is an area for future 
research.
The household real wealth variable is AA. The household after-tax interest rate 
variables in the model are RSA, a short-term rate, and RMA, a long-term rate. These 
interest rates are nominal rates. Chapter 3 is concerned with testing for nominal versus 
real interest rate effects, and it will be seen that in most cases the data support the use 
of nominal over real interest rates.
Age distribution variables, AG1, AG2, and AG3, were tried in the four expenditure 
equations, and they were jointly significant at the 5 percent level in three of the four, 

24
2 || The MC Model
the insignificant results occurring for the IHH equation. They were retained in the three 
equations in which they were significant.2
2. The age distribution variables are explained in Fair (1994), section 4.7. They are meant to pick up the 
effects of the changing age distribution of the U.S. population on aggregate household expenditures.
Table Al: Equation 1. CS, consumer expenditures: services
Equation 1 is in real, per capita terms and is in log form. The explanatory variables 
include income, an interest rate, wealth, the time trend, and the age variables.
The age variables are highly jointly significant (/?-value zero to four places), and 
all the other variables are significant. The significance of the time trend suggests that 
there is a trend in the relationship not captured in any of the other variables. For 
the leads tests income is the variable for which led values were tried—in the form 
log[YD/(POP ■ PH)]. For the lags test the lagged values of the age variables were not 
included. The equation passes the lags, RHO, and leads tests, but it fails the AP stability 
tests. The AP results suggest that there is a break in the late 1970s.
Table A2: Equation 2. CN, consumer expenditures: nondurables
Equation 2 is also in real, per capita, and log terms. The explanatory variables include 
income, an interest rate, wealth, and the age variables.
The age variables are jointly significant at the 5 percent level (/7-value of .0417). 
The other variables are also significant. Both the level and the change of the lagged 
dependent variable are significant in the equation, and so the dynamic specification 
is more complicated than that of equation 1. Again income is the variable for which 
led values were tried, and for the lags test the lagged values of the age variables were 
not included. The equation fails the lags and RHO tests, and it passes the T and leads 
tests. It also fails the AP stability tests, with the break point probably in the mid- to late 
1970s. The failure of the lags and RHO tests suggests that the dynamics have not been 
completely captured.
Table A3: Equation 3. CD, consumer expenditures: durables
Equation 3 is in real, per capita terms. The explanatory variables include income, 
an interest rate, wealth, the age variables, DEED(KD / POP) — (CD/POP)_\, and 
(KD/POP)_y. KD is the stock of durable goods, and DELD is the depreciation rate of 
the stock. The construction of these two variables is explained in Appendix A.
The justification for including the stock variable in the equation is as follows. 
Let KD
**
 denote the stock of durable goods that would be desired if there were no 
adjustment costs of any kind. If durable consumption is proportional to the stock of 
durables, then the determinants of consumption can be assumed to be the determinants 
of KD
**
\
KD
**
 = f (...), 
(2.1) 

2.4 || The US Stochastic Equations
25
where the arguments of f are the determinants of consumption. Two types of partial 
adjustments are then postulated. The first is an adjustment of the durable stock:
KD* - KD_{ = k(KD** - KD_/), 
(2.2)
3. Note in Table A3 that CD is divided by POP, and CD_} and KD_} are divided by POP_V, where POP 
is population. If equations 2.1-2.4 are defined in per capita terms, where the current values are divided by 
POP and the lagged values are divided by POP_ ।, then the present per capita treatment of equation 2.5 
follows. The only problem with this is that the definition used to justify equation 2.3 does not hold if the 
lagged stock is divided by POP_ t. All variables must be divided by the same population variable for the 
definition to hold. This is, however, a minor problem, and it has been ignored here. The same holds for 
equation 4.
where KD
*
 is the stock of durable goods that would be desired if there were no costs 
of changing durable expenditures. Given KD
*,
 desired durable expenditures, CD
*,
 is 
postulated to be
CD* = KD* - (1 - DEED}KD_Y, 
(2.3)
where DELD is the depreciation rate. By definition CD = KD — (1 — DELD}KD}. 
and equation 2.3 is merely the same equation for the desired values. The second type 
of adjustment is an adjustment of durable expenditures, CD, to its desired value:
CD — CD_\ = y(CD* — CD_\} + e. 
(2.4)
This equation is assumed to reflect costs of changing durable expenditures. Combining 
equations 2.1-2.4 yields:
CD - CD_{ = y(DELD • KI) \ - CD_X} + yXKD_{ 
+ 
(...) + c.
This specification of the two types of adjustment is a way of adding to the durable 
expenditure equation both the lagged dependent variable and the lagged stock of 
durables. Otherwise, the explanatory variables are the same as they are in the other 
expenditure equations.3
The interest rate used in equation 3, RM A, is multiplied by a scale variable, CDA. 
CDA is exogenous in the model. It is constructed from a peak to peak interpolation of 
CD/POP.
All the variables in equation 3 are significant except the wealth variable, which 
has a /-statistic of 1.53. The estimate of y, the coefficient of DELD(KD / POP} — 
(CD/POP}_b is 0.329. This is the partial adjustment coefficient for CD. The estimate 
of yX, the coefficient of (KD/POP}_1? is 0.024, which gives an implied value of A, 
the partial adjustment coefficient for KD
*,
 of 0.073. KD
*
 is thus estimated to adjust to 
KD
**
 at a rate of 0.073 per quarter. Income is the variable for which led values were 
tried, and for the lags test the lagged values of the age variables were not included. The 
equation passes the lags, RHO, and T tests. It passes two of the three leads tests. It fails 
the AP tests, where the break is probably in the mid- to late 1970s.

26
2 || The MC Model
Table A4: Equation 4. IHH, residential investment—h
The same partial adjustment model is used for residential investment that 
was used above for durable expenditures, which adds DELH(KH/POP)_X — 
(IHHIPOP) _b and (KH/POP)_\ to the residential investment equation. KH is the 
stock of housing, and DELH is the depreciation rate of the stock. The construction 
of these two variables is explained in Appendix A. Equation 4 does not include the 
wealth variable because the variable was not significant. Likewise, it does not include 
the age variables because they were not significant. It is estimated under the assumption 
of a second-order autoregressive process for the error term. The interest rate used in 
equation 4, RMA_{, is multiplied by a scale variable, IHHA. IHHA is exogenous in the 
model. It is constructed from a peak-to-peak interpolation of IHH/POP.
Income is the variable for which led values were tried. All the variables in equation 4 
are significant, and it passes all the tests, including the stability tests. The estimate of 
y, the partial adjustment coefficient for IHH, is 0.538. The estimate of yk is 0.033, 
which gives an implied value of X, the partial adjustment coefficient for KH
*,
 of 0.061.
Table A5: Equation 5. LI, labor force—men 25-54
Equation 5 explains the labor force participation rate of men aged 25-54. It is in log 
form and includes as explanatory variables the wealth variable and the unemployment 
rate. The unemployment rate is meant to pick up the effect of the labor constraint on 
labor supply (a discouraged worker effect).
The wealth variable has a negative coefficient estimate, as expected. The unemploy­
ment rate also has a negative coefficient estimate, as expected, although it only has a 
t-statiStic of — 1.69. The equation passes the lags and T tests, but it fails the RHO test. 
It passes two of the three AP tests.
Table A6: Equation 6. L2, labor force—women 25-54
Equation 6 explains the labor force participation rate of women aged 25-54. It is in log 
form and includes as explanatory variables the real wage and the wealth variable.
Again, the wealth variable has a negative coefficient estimate. The real wage variable 
has a positive coefficient estimate, implying that the substitution effect dominates 
the income effect. The variable for which led values were tried is the real wage, 
log(W4/P//). The equation passes all the tests. One of the y2 tests has log PH added 
as an explanatory variable. This is a test of the use of the real wage in the equation. If 
log PH is significant, this is a rejection of the hypothesis that the coefficient of log WA 
is equal to the negative of the coefficient of log PH, which is implied by the use of the 
real wage. As can be seen, log PH is not significant.
Table A7: Equation 7. L3, labor force—all others 16+
Equation 7 explains the labor force participation rate of all others aged 16+. It is also 
in log form and includes as explanatory variables the real wage, the wealth variable, 
and the unemployment rate.

2.4 || The US Stochastic Equations
27
The coefficient estimate of the real wage is positive and the coefficient estimate of 
the wealth variable is negative, although neither is significant. The unemployment rate 
has a significantly negative coefficient estimate. The variable for which led values were 
tried is the real wage.4 The equation passes all the tests except one of the three AP tests.
4. Collinearity problems prevented the Leads +4 test from being performed for equation 7.
Table A8: Equation 8. LM, number of moonlighters
Equation 8 determines the number of moonlighters. It is in log form and includes as 
explanatory variables the real wage and the unemployment rate.
The coefficient estimate of the real wage is positive and significant, suggesting 
that the substitution effect dominates for moonlighters. The coefficient estimate of the 
unemployment rate is negative and significant, which is the discouraged worker effect 
applied to moonlighters. The variable for which led values were tried is the real wage. 
The equation passes the lags, RHO, and leads tests. It fails the T test. It also fails the 
test of adding log PH (log PH is significant), which is evidence against the real wage 
constraint. It fails the three AP tests.
This completes the discussion of the household expenditure and labor supply equations. 
A summary of some of the general results across the equations is in Section 2.4.11.
2.4.3 The Main Firm Sector Equations
In the maximization problem of a firm in the theoretical model there are five main 
decision variables: the firm’s price, production, investment, demand for employment, 
and wage rate. These five decision variables are determined jointly in that they are 
the result of solving one maximization problem. The variables that affect this solution 
include (1) the initial stocks of excess capital, excess labor, and inventories, (2) the 
current and expected future values of the interest rate, (3) the current and expected 
future demand schedules for the firm’s output, (4) the current and expected future supply 
schedules of labor facing the firm, and (5) the firm’s expectations of other firms’ future 
price and wage decisions.
In the econometric model seven variables are chosen to represent the five decisions: 
(1) the price level for the firm sector, PF; (2) production, Y; (3) investment in nonresi- 
dential plant and equipment, IKF; (4) the number of jobs in the firm sector, JF; (5) the 
average number of hours paid per job, HF; (6) the average number of overtime hours 
paid per job, HO; and (7) the wage rate of the firm sector, WF. Each of these variables 
is determined by a stochastic equation, and these are the main stochastic equations of 
the firm sector.
Moving from the theoretical model of firm behavior to the econometric specifica­
tions is not straightforward, and a number of approximations have been made. One of 
the key approximations is to assume that the five decisions of a firm are made sequen­
tially rather than jointly. The sequence is from the price decision, to the production 

28
2 || The MC Model
decision, to the investment and employment decisions, to the wage rate decision. In 
this way of looking at the problem, the firm first chooses its optimal price path. This 
path implies a certain expected sales path, from which the optimal production path is 
chosen. Given the optimal production path, the optimal paths of investment and em­
ployment are chosen. Finally, given the optimal employment path, the optimal wage 
path is chosen.
Table A10: Equation 10. PF, price deflator for X — FA
Equation 10 is the key price equation in the model. The equation is in log form. The 
price level is a function of the lagged price level, the wage rate inclusive of the employer 
social security tax rate, the price of imports, the unemployment rate, and the time trend. 
The unemployment rateistaken as a measure of demand pressure. The lagged price level 
is meant to pick up expectational effects, and the wage rate and import price variables 
are meant to pick up cost effects. The log of the wage rate variable has subtracted from 
it log LAM, where LAM is a measure of potential labor productivity. The construction 
of LAM is explained in Appendix A; it is computed from a peak to peak interpolation of 
measured productivity. LAM is also discussed in section 6.4 in the analysis of long-run 
productivity movements.
An important feature of the price equation is that the price level is explained by 
the equation, not the price change. This treatment is contrary to the standard Phillips- 
curve treatment, where the price (or wage) change is explained by the equation. It is 
also contrary to the standard NAIRU specification, where the change in the change in 
the price level (that is, the change in the inflation rate) is explained. In the theoretical 
model the natural decision variables of a firm are the levels of prices and wages. For 
example, the market share equations in the theoretical model have a firm’s market share 
as a function of the ratio of the firm’s price to the average price of other firms. These 
are price levels, and the objective of the firm is to choose the price-level path (along 
with the paths of the other decision variables) that maximizes the multiperiod objective 
function. A firm decides what its price level should be relative to the price levels of 
other firms. This thus argues for a specification in levels, which is used here. The issue 
of the best functional form for the price equation is the subject matter of Chapter 4, 
where the NAIRU model is tested.
The time trend in equation 10 is meant to pick up any trend effects on the price level 
not captured by the other variables. Adding the time trend to an equation like 10 is 
similar to adding the constant term to an equation specified in terms of changes rather 
than levels. The time trend will also pick up any trend mistakes made in constructing 
LAM. If, for example, LAMt — LAM® + cqt, where LAM® is the correct variable to 
subtract from the wage rate variable to adjust for potential productivity, then the time 
trend will absorb this error.
All the variables in equation 10 are significant. The variable for which led values 
were tried is the wage rate variable. All the y2 tests are passed. The last two tests have 
output gap variables added. When each of these variables is added, it is not significant 
and (not shown) the unemployment rate retains its significance. The unemployment 

2.4 || The US Stochastic Equations
29
rate thus dominates the output gap variables. The equation passes two of the three AP 
tests.
Table All: Equation 11. Y, production—f
The specification of the production equation is where the assumption that a firm’s 
decisions are made sequentially begins to be used. The equation is based on the 
assumption that the firm sector first sets its price, then knows what its sales for the 
current period will be, and from this latter information decides on what its production 
for the current period will be.
In the theoretical model production is smoothed relative to sales. The reason for this 
is various costs of adjustment, which include costs ofchanging employment, costs of 
changing the capital stock, and costs of having the stock of inventories deviate from 
some proportion of sales. If a firm were only interested in minimizing inventory costs, it 
would produce according to the following equation (assuming that sales for the current 
period are known):
Y = X + fiX -V_h 
(2.6)
where Y is the level of production, X is the level of sales, V_ j is the stock of inventories 
at the end of the previous period, and fi is the inventory-sales ratio that minimizes 
inventory costs. The construction of V is explained in Appendix A. Since by definition 
V — V_| = Y — X, producing according to equation 2.6 would ensure that V = fiX. 
Because of the other adjustment costs, it is generally not optimal for a firm to produce 
according to equation 2.6. In the theoretical model there was no need to postulate 
explicitly how a firm’s production plan deviated from equation 2.6 because its optimal 
production plan just resulted, along with the other optimal paths, from the direct solution 
of its maximization problem. For the empirical work, however, it is necessary to make 
further assumptions.
The estimated production equation is based on the following three assumptions:
log V* = fi log X, 
(2.7)
log T* = log X + a(log V* - log V-i), 
(2.8)
log Y - log y_! = A(log r* - log y_j) + e, 
(2.9)
where * denotes a desired value. (In the following discussion all variables are assumed 
to be in logs.) Equation 2.7 states that the desired stock of inventories is proportional to 
current sales. Equation 2.8 states that the desired level of production is equal to sales plus 
some fraction of the difference between the desired stock of inventories and the stock 
on hand at the end of the previous period. Equation 2.9 states that actual production 
partially adjusts to desired production each period.
Combining equations 2.7-2.9 yields
log y = (1 - Z) log y_! + Z(1 + otfi) log X - Tot log V-J + e. (2.10) 

30
2 || The MC Model
Equation 11 is the estimated version of equation 2.10. The equation is estimated under 
the assumption of a third-order autoregressive process of the error term, and three 
dummy variables are added to account for the effects of a steel strike in the last half of 
1959.
The estimate of 1 — A is 0.317, and so the implied value of A is 0.683, which means 
that actual production adjusts 68.3 percent of the way to desired production in the 
current quarter. The estimate of 7m is 0.241, and so the implied value of a is 0.353. This 
means that (in logs) desired production is equal to sales plus 35.3 percent of the desired 
change in inventories. The estimate of A(1 + a/3) is 0.880, and so the implied value of 
(3 is 1.197. The variable for which led values were used is the log level of sales, log X. 
Equation 11 passes all the tests. The passing of the leads tests, which means that the 
led values are not significant, is evidence against the hypothesis that firms have rational 
expectations regarding future values of sales.
The estimates of equation 11 are consistent with the view that firms smooth produc­
tion relative to sales. The view that production is smoothed relative to sales was chal­
lenged by Blinder (1981) and others. This work was in turn challenged in Fair (1989) as 
being based on faulty data. The results in Fair (1989), which use data in physical units, 
suggest that production is smoothed relative to sales. The results using the physical 
units data thus provide some support for the current aggregate estimates.
Table A12: Equation 12. KK, stock of capital—f
Equation 12 explains the stock of capital of the firm sector, KK. Given KK, the 
nonresidential fixed investment of the firm sector, IKF, is determined by identity 92:
IKF = KK - (1 - DELK)KK_\, 
(92)
where DELK is the depreciation rate. The construction of KK and DELK is explained 
in Appendix A. Equation 12 will sometimes be referred to as an “investment” equation, 
since IKF is determined once KK is.
Equation 12 is based on the assumption that the production decision has already 
been made. In the theoretical model, because of costs of changing the capital stock, it 
may sometimes be optimal for a firm to hold excess capital. If there were no such costs, 
investment each period would merely be the amount needed to have enough capital to 
produce the output of the period. In the theoretical model there was no need to postulate 
explicitly how investment deviates from this amount, but for the empirical work this 
must be done.
The estimated equation for KK is based on the following two equations:
log^V^-i) = a0 log(KK 
KKMIN_j) + oqA log Y
+ a2A log T_! + a3A log Y_2 + cqA log Y_3

2.4 || The US Stochastic Equations
31
where r is some measure of the cost of capital, a0 and a6 are negative, and the other 
coefficients are positive. The construction of KKMIN is explained in Appendix A. It is, 
under the assumption of a putty-clay technology, an estimate of the minimum amount 
of capital required to produce the current level of output, Y. KK KKMIN is thus the 
ratio of the actual capital stock on hand at the end of the previous period to the minimum 
required to produce the output of that period. The variable log(KK_\/KKMIN_}) will 
be referred to as the amount of “excess capital” on hand.
KK
*
 in equation 2.11 is the value of the capital stock the firm would desire to have 
on hand in the current period if there were no costs of changing the capital stock. The 
desired change, \og(KK
*/KK_i),
 depends on (1) the amount of excess capital on hand, 
(2) five change-in-output terms, and (3) the cost of capital. The lagged output changes 
are meant to be proxies for expected future output changes. Other things equal, the firm 
desires to increase the capital stock if the output changes are positive. Equation 2.12 is a 
partial adjustment equation of the actual capital stock to the desired stock. It states that 
the actual percentage change in the capital stock is a fraction of the desired percentage 
change.
Ignoring the cost-of-capital term in equation 2.11, the equation says that the desired 
capital stock approaches KKMIN in the long run if output is not changing. How can 
the cost of capital term be justified? In the theoretical model the cost of capital affects 
the capital stock by affecting the kinds of machines that are purchased. If the cost 
of capital falls, machines with lower labor requirements are purchased, other things 
being equal. For the empirical work, data are not available by types of machines, and 
approximations have to be made. The key approximation that is made in Appendix A 
is the postulation of a putty-clay technology in the construction of KKMIN. If there 
is in fact some substitution of capital for labor in the short run, the cost of capital is 
likely to affect the firm’s desired capital stock, and this is the reason for including a 
cost-of-capital term in equation 2.11.
Combining equations 2.11 and 2.12 yields:
A log KK = Za0 \og(KK_{/KKMIN+ (1 - X)A log KK_{
-p Xq!|A log Y -p Xo^A log T_] -p Aof^A log Y_^ 
(2.13)
-p A.CX4A log -p Act^A log Y_4 -p 
-p 6.
Equation 12 is the estimated version of equation 2.13.
The estimate of 1 — X is 0.938, and so the implied value of X is 0.062. The estimate 
of Aa() is —0.0068, and so the implied value of a() is —0.110. This is the estimate of 
the size of the effect of excess capital on the desired stock of capital. The variable for 
which led values were tried is the log change in output. Equation 12 passes all the tests. 
The passing of the leads tests is evidence against the hypothesis that firms have rational 
expectations with respect to future values of output.
There are two cost-of-capital variables in equation 12. Both are lagged two quarters. 
One is an estimate of the real AAA bond rate, which is the nominal AAA bond rate, RB, 
less the four-quarter rate of inflation. The other is a function of stock price changes. It is 
the ratio of capital gains or losses on the financial assets of the household sector (mostly 

32
2 || The MC Model
from corporate stocks) over three quarters to nominal potential output. This ratio is a 
measure of how well or poorly the stock market is doing. If the stock market is doing 
well, for example, the ratio is high, which should in general lower the cost of capital 
to firms. Both cost-of-capital variables are significant in Table Al2, with /-statistics of 
-2.45 and 2.19.
One might think that the second cost-of-capital variable in equation 12 is simply 
picking up the boom in the stock market and in investment since 1995. However, when 
equation 12 is estimated only through 1994.4, this cost-of-capital variable has even 
a larger coefficient estimate than in Table A12 (0.00062 versus 0.00048) and is still 
significant (/"-statistic of 2.08).
Table A13: Equation 13. JF, number of jobs—f
The employment equation 13 and the hours equation 14 are similar in spirit to the capital 
stock equation 12. They are also based on the assumption that the production decision 
is made first. Because of adjustment costs, it is sometimes optimal in the theoretical 
model for firms to hold excess labor. Were it not for the costs of changing employment, 
the optimal level of employment would merely be the amount needed to produce the 
output of the period. In the theoretical model there was no need to postulate explicitly 
how employment deviates from this amount, but this must be done for the empiri­
cal work.
The estimated employment equation is based on the following two equations:
log(JF
*/JF_!)
 = aQ log[JF_l/(JHMFV_l/HFS'_1)] 
+ aqA log Y, 
log(JF/JF_,) - log(JF_1/JF_2) =
X[log(JF
*/JF_
1) - log^F-i/JF^)] + 6,
(2.14)
(2.15)
where a0 is negative and the other coefficients are positive. The construction of JHMIN 
and HFS is explained in Appendix A. JHMIN is, under the assumption of a putty-clay 
technology, an estimate of the minimum number of worker hours required to produce 
the current level of output, Y. HFS is an estimate of the desired number of hours worked 
per worker. JF (JHMIN HFS _}) is the ratio of the actual number of workers on 
hand at the end of the previous period to the minimum number required to produce the 
output of that period if the average number of hours worked were HFS_^. The variable 
\og[JF_]/JHMIN_]/HFS_/)\ will be referred to as the amount of “excess labor” on 
hand.
JF
*  in equation 2.14 is the number of workers the firm would desire to have 
on hand in the current period if there were no costs of changing employment. The 
desired change, log(JF
*/JF_
1), depends on the amount of excess labor on hand 
and the change in output. This equation says that the desired number of work­
ers approaches JHMIN/HFS in the long run if output is not changing. Equa­
tion 2.15 is a partial adjustment equation of the actual number of workers to the desired 
number.

Combining equations 2.14 and 2.15 yields:

Equation 13 is the estimated version of equation 2.16. It has a dummy variable, D593, 
added to pick up the effects of a steel strike.
The estimate of 1 — A is 0.455, and so the implied value of A is 0.545. The estimate 
of Aa0 is —0.105, and so the implied value of a0 is —0.193. This is the estimate of the 
size of the effect of excess labor on the desired number of workers. The variable for 
which led values were tried is the change in the log of output. The equation passes all 
the tests. Again, the passing of the leads tests is evidence against the hypothesis that 
firms have rational expectations with respect to future values of output.
Table A14: Equation 14. HF, average number of hours paid per job—f
The estimated hours equation is:
A log HF — X logCHF-i/HES-j)
(2.17) 
+ c/0log[JF_l/(j™ZA-l/HFS_1)] + c/1Alogy+ e.
The first term on the right-hand side of equation 2.17 is the (logarithmic) difference 
between the actual number of hours paid for in the previous period and the desired 
number. The reason for the inclusion of this term in the hours equation but not in the 
employment equation is that, unlike JF, HF fluctuates around a slowly trending level 
of hours. This restriction is captured by the first term in 2.17. The other two terms are 
the amount of excess labor on hand and the current change in output. Both of these 
terms affect the employment decision, and they should also affect the hours decision 
since the two are closely related. Equation 14 is the estimated version of equation 2.17.
The estimate of A is —0.216, and the estimate of c/0 is —0.041. All the coefficient 
estimates are significant in the equation. The variable for which led values were tried 
is the change in the log of output. The equation passes all the y2 tests. It fails the three 
AP tests.
Table Al5: Equation 15. HO, average number of overtime hours paid per job—f
Equation 15 explains overtime hours, HO. Let HFF = HF — HFS, which is the devia­
tion of actual hours per worker from desired hours. One would expect HO to be close to 
zero for low values of HFF (that is, when actual hours are much below desired hours), 
and to increase roughly one for one for high values of HFF. An approximation to this 
relationship is
/7O = e“1+“2HFF+e, 
(2.18)
which in log form is
log HO = &! + a2HFF + e.
(2.19)

34
2 || The MC Model
Equation 15 is the estimated version of equation 2.19. Both HFF and HFF_^ are 
included in the equation, which appears to capture the dynamics better. The equation 
is estimated under the assumption of a first-order autoregressive error term.
All the coefficient estimates in equation 15 are significant, and the equation passes 
all but the T test.
Table A16: Equation 16. WF, average hourly earnings excluding overtime—f
Equation 16 is the wage rate equation. It is in log form. In the final specification, the 
wage rate was simply taken to be a function of the constant term, the time trend, the 
current value of the price level, the lagged value of the price level, and the lagged value 
of the wage rate. Labor market tightness variables like the unemployment rate were 
not significant in the equation. The time trend is added to account for trend changes 
in the wage rate relative to the price level. The potential productivity variable, LAM, 
is subtracted from the wage rate in equation 16. The price equation, equation 10, is 
identified because the wage rate equation includes the lagged wage rate, which the 
price equation does not. The wage rate equation is identified because the price equation 
includes the price of imports and the unemployment rate, which the wage rate equation 
does not.
A constraint was imposed on the coefficients in the wage equation to ensure that 
the determination of the real wage implied by equations 10 and 16 is sensible. Let 
p = log PF and w = log WF. The relevant parts of the price and wage equations 
regarding the constraints are
p = 
+ O + • • •, 
(2.20)
w = yjw_j + y2p + ?3P-\ + • • • • 
(2.21)
The implied real wage equation from these two equations should not have w — p as a 
function of either w or p separately, since one does not expect the real wage to grow 
simply because the levels of w and p are growing. The desired form of the real wage 
equation is thus
w - p = 
p_\) + . . ., 
(2.22)
which says that the real wage is a function of its own lagged value plus other terms. 
The real wage in equation 2.22 is not a function of the level of w or p separately. The 
constraint on the coefficients in equations 2.20 and 2.21 that imposes this restriction is:
Y3 = [^1/(1 - 0(1 -y2)-n- 
(2.23)
This constraint is imposed in the estimation by first estimating the price equation to get 
estimates of and ft2 and then using these estimates to impose the constraint on y3 in 
the wage equation.
The coefficient estimates in equation 16 are significant, and the equation passes all 
the tests. One of the /2 tests is a test of the real wage restriction, and this restriction 
is not rejected by the data. The final /2 test in the table has the unemployment rate 

2.4 || The US Stochastic Equations

added as an explanatory variable, and it is not significant. As noted above, no demand 
pressure variables were found to be significant in the wage equation.
2.4.4 Other Firm Sector Equations
There are three other, fairly minor, equations of the firm sector, explaining dividends 
paid, inventory valuation adjustment, and capital consumption.
Table A18: Equation 18. DF, dividends paid—f
Let fl denote after-tax profits. If in the long run firms desire to pay out all of their after­
tax profits in dividends, one can write DF
*
 — n, where DF
*
 is the long-run desired 
value of dividends for profit level IL If it is assumed that actual dividends are partially 
adjusted to desired dividends each period as
DF/DF_{ = (DF
*/DF_
{)xe€, 
(2.24)
then the equation to be estimated is
A log DF — X logCn/DF.O + e. 
(2.25)
Equation 18 is the estimated version of equation 2.25. The level of after-tax profits in 
the notation of the model is PIEF — TFG — TFS.
The estimate of A is 0.027, which implies a slow adjustment of actual to desired 
dividends. The equation passes the lags and T tests, but it fails the RHO test. The 
last x2 test in Table Al8 shows that the constant term is not significant. The above 
specification does not call for the constant term, and this is supported by the data. 
Regarding the first /2 test in the table, because of the assumption that DF
*
 — 11, the 
coefficient of \og(PIEF — TEG — TFS) is restricted to be the negative of the coefficient 
of log DFIf instead DF
*
 = Ur, where y is not equal to one, then the restriction 
does not hold. The first test in the table is a test of the restriction (that is, a test 
that y — 1), and the hypothesis that y = 1 is not rejected. The equation fails the AP 
tests.
Table A20: Equation 20. IVA, inventory valuation adjustment
In theory IVA = —(P — P_l)V_1, where P is the price of the good and V is the stock 
of inventories of the good. Equation 20 is meant to approximate this. IVA is regressed 
on (PX — PX_])V_y, where PX is the price deflator for the sales of the firm sector. 
The equation is estimated under the assumption of a first-order autoregressive error 
term.
The coefficient estimate of (PX — PX_])V_y is negative, as expected, and signifi­
cant. The equation passes the %2 tests and one of the three AP tests.
Table A20: Equation 21. CCF, capital consumption—f
In practice capital consumption allowances of a firm depend on tax laws and on current 
and past values of its investment. Equation 21 is an attempt to approximate this for 

36
2 || The MC Model
the firm sector. PIK • IKF is the current value of investment. The use of the lagged 
dependent variable in the equation is meant to approximate the dependence of capital 
consumption allowances on past values of investment. This specification implies that 
the lag structure is geometrically declining. The restriction is also imposed that the 
sum of the lag coefficients is one, which means that capital consumption allowances 
are assumed to be taken on all investment in the long run. Nine dummy variables are 
included in the equation, which are meant to pick up tax law changes. The equation 
is estimated under the assumption of a first-order autoregressive process for the error 
term.
The coefficient estimate of the investment term is significant. The first /2 test is a 
test of the restriction that the sum of the lag coefficients is one. This is done by adding 
log CCF_[ to the equation. This restriction is not rejected by the data. The equation 
passes all the other tests.
2.4.5 Money Demand Equations
In the theoretical model a household’s demand for money depends on the level of 
transactions, the interest rate, and the household’s wage rate. High wage rate households 
spend less time taking care of money holdings than do low wage rate households and 
thus on average hold more money. With aggregate data it is not possible to estimate 
this wage rate effect on the demand for money, and in the empirical work the demand 
for money has simply been taken to be a function of the interest rate and a transactions 
variable.
The model contains three demand-for-money equations: one for the household 
sector, one for the firm sector, and a demand for currency equation. Before presenting 
these equations it will be useful to discuss how the dynamics were handled. The key 
question about the dynamics is whether the adjustment of actual to desired values is in 
nominal or real terms.
Let M
*/P
t denote the desired level of real money balances, let yt denote a measure 
of real transactions, and let rt denote a short-term interest rate. Assume that the equation 
determining desired money balances is in log form and write
\og(M
*/P
t') = a + logy, + yrt. 
(2.26)
Note that the log form has not been used for the interest rate. Interest rates can at times 
be quite low, and it may not be sensible to take the log of the interest rate. If, for example, 
the interest rate rises from 0.02 to 0.03, the log of the rate rises from —3.91 to —3.51, 
a change of 0.40. If, on the other hand, the interest rate rises from 0.10 to 0.11, the log 
of the rate rises from —2.30 to —2.21, a change of only 0.09. One does not necessarily 
expect a one-percentage-point rise in the interest rate to have four times the effect on 
the log of desired money holdings when the change is from a base of 0.02 rather than 
0.10. In practice the results of estimating money demand equations do not seem to be 
very sensitive to whether the level or the log of the interest rate is used. For the work 
in this book the level of the interest rate has been used.

2.4 || The US Stochastic Equations
37
If the adjustment of actual to desired money holdings is in real terms, the adjustment 
equation is
log(M?/Pr) - logC^-T/ A-1) - ^[log(M;/P?) - log(Mr_,/Pt_0] + 6. (2.27)
If the adjustment is in nominal terms, the adjustment equation is
log Mt - log Mt_} = X(log M
*  - log Mt_}) + At. 
(2.28)
Combining 2.26 and 2.27 yields
log(Mr/Pf) — Aa + log yt + Xyrt + (1 - A) \og(Mt_}/Pt_,) + 6. (2.29)
Combining 2.26 and 2.28 yields
log(M?/Pr) = 
+ log yt + kyrt + (1 - A) log(Mr_,/Pr) + /z. (2.30)
Equations 2.29 and 2.30 differ in the lagged money term. In 2.29, which is the real 
adjustment specification, Mt_\ is divided by 
whereas in 2.30, which is the nominal
adjustment specification, is divided by Pt.
A test of the two hypotheses is simply to put both lagged money variables in the 
equation and see which one dominates. If the real adjustment specification is correct, 
log(Mt_{/Pt_}) should be significant and log(Mt_{/Pt) should not, and vice versa if the 
nominal adjustment specification is correct. This test may, of course, be inconclusive in 
that both terms may be significant or insignificant, but I have found that this is rarely the 
case. This test was performed on the three demand-for-money equations, and in each 
case the nominal adjustment specification won. The nominal adjustment specification 
has thus been used for the three equations.
It should be noted that the demand-for-money equations are not important in the 
model because of the use of the interest rate rule (equation 30 below). They are included 
more for completeness than anything else. When the interest rate rule is used, the short­
term interest rate is determined by the rule and the overall money supply is whatever is 
needed to have the demand-for-money equations be met.
Table A9: Equation 9. MH, demand deposits and currency—h
Equation 9 is the demand-for-money equation of the household sector. It is in per capita 
terms and is in log form. Disposable income is used as the transactions variable, and the 
after-tax three-month Treasury bill rate, RSA, is used as the interest rate. The equation 
also includes the time trend. A dummy variable is added, which is 1 in 1998:1 and 0 
otherwise. In the data for 1998:1 there is a huge decrease in MH and a huge decrease 
in MF, demand deposits and currency of the firm sector. This may be a data error or 
definitional change, and it was accounted for by the use of the dummy variable. The 
equation is estimated under the assumption of a fourth-order autoregressive process of 
the error term.
The test results show that the lagged dependent variable that pertains to the real ad­
justment specification, log [MH / (POP • PH)]_1, is insignificant. This thus supports the 

38
2 || The MC Model
nominal adjustment hypothesis. The interest rate is highly significant in the equation, 
but the income variable has a t-statistic of only 1.55. Equation 9 passes the lags test, 
but it fails the three AP tests. For another test, the age distribution variables were added 
to the equation to see if possible differences in the demand for money by age could be 
picked up. The “%2 (AGE)” value in Table A9 shows that the age distribution variables 
are not jointly significant (y?-value of 0.2971). They were thus not included in the final 
specification.
The sum of the four autoregressive coefficients is 0.98339. For the preliminary 
bootstrap work in Chapter 9 some of the estimates of the equation had sums greater 
than 1.0, which sometimes led to solution failures. For the final results in Chapter 9, 
equation 9 was dropped from the model and MH was taken to be exogenous. As 
noted above, equation 9 is not important in the model, and so little is lost by drop­
ping it.
Table A17: Equation 17. MF, demand deposits and currency—f
Equation 17 is the demand-for-money equation of the firm sector. The equation is in 
log form. The transactions variable is the level of nonfarm firm sales, X — FA, and the 
interest rate variable is the after-tax three-month Treasury bill rate. The tax rates used in 
this equation are the corporate tax rates, D2G and D2S, not the personal tax rates used 
for RSA in equation 9. The dummy variable for 1998:1 mentioned above is included in 
the equation.
All the variables are significant in the equation. The test results show that the lagged 
dependent variable that pertains to the real adjustment specification, log(MF/PF)_b 
is insignificant. The equation passes all the tests.
Table A26: Equation 26. CUR, currency held outside banks
Equation 26 is the demand-for-currency equation. It is in per capita terms and is in 
log form. The transactions variable that is used is the level of nonfarm firm sales. The 
interest rate variable used is RSA, and the equation is estimated under the assumption 
of a first-order autoregressive error term.
All the variables in the equation are significant. The test results show that the lagged 
dependent variable that pertains to the real adjustment specification, \og[CUR/(POP • 
PF)]_b is not significant, which supports the nominal adjustment specification. The 
equation passes all the tests except one of the three AP tests.
2.4.6 Other Financial Equations
The stochastic equations for the financial sector consist of an equation explaining 
member bank borrowing from the Federal Reserve, two term structure equations, and 
an equation explaining the change in stock prices.
Table A22: Equation 22. BO, bank borrowing from the Fed
The variable BO/BR is the ratio of borrowed reserves to total reserves. This ratio is 
assumed to be a positive function of the three-month Treasury bill rate, RS, and a 

2.4 || The US Stochastic Equations
39
negative function of the discount rate, RD. The estimated equation also includes the 
constant term and the lagged dependent variable.
The coefficient estimates of RS and RD in Table A22 are positive and negative, 
respectively, as expected, but they are not significant. The equation passes the lags and 
T tests, and it fails the RHO and AP tests.
As is the case for the demand-for-money equations, equation 22 is not important 
in the model because of the use of the interest rate rule (equation 30 below). It is 
again included for completeness. When the interest rate rule is used, the short-term 
interest rate is determined by the rule and BO is whatever is needed to have equation 22 
be met.
Table A23: Equation 23. RB, bond rate
Table A24: Equation 24. RM, mortgage rate
The expectations theory of the term structure of interest rates states that long-term 
rates are a function of the current and expected future short-term rates. The two 
long-term interest rates in the model are the bond rate, RB, and the mortgage rate, 
RM. These rates are assumed to be determined according to the expectations theory, 
where the current and past values of the short-term interest rate (the three-month 
Treasury bill rate, RS) are used as proxies for expected future values. Equations 23 
and 24 are the two estimated equations. The lagged dependent variable is used in 
each of these equations, which implies a fairly complicated lag structure relating each 
long-term rate to the past values of the short-term rate. In addition, a constraint has 
been imposed on the coefficient estimates. The sum of the coefficients of the current 
and lagged values of the short-term rate has been constrained to be equal to one 
minus the coefficient of the lagged long-term rate. This means that, for example, a 
sustained one-percentage-point increase in the short-term rate eventually results in a 
one-percentage-point increase in the long-term rate. (This restriction is imposed by 
subtracting RS_2 from each of the other interest rates in the equations.) Equation 23 
(but not 24) is estimated under the assumption of a first-order autoregressive error 
term.
The overall results for the two equations are quite good. The short-term interest 
rates are significant in the two estimated equations except for 7?S | in equation 24. The 
first test result for each equation shows that the coefficient restriction is not rejected for 
either equation. Both equations pass the lags, RHO, and T tests. Equation 23 passes 
the three AP tests, and equation 24 passes one of the three. The variable for which 
led values were tried is the short-term interest rate, RS, and the /2 tests show that 
the led values are not significant. Two inflation expectations variables, p^ and p% , 
were added to the equations, and the test results also show that these variables are not 
significant.5
5. The restriction regarding the sum of the coefficients was not imposed for the lags, leads, and inflation 
expectations tests. Collinearity problems prevented the Leads +4 test from being performed for equation 23.

40
2 || The MC Model
Table A25: Equation 25. CG, capital gains or losses on the financial assets of h
The variable CG is the change in the market value of financial assets held by the 
household sector, almost all of which is the change in the market value of corporate 
stocks held by the household sector. In the theoretical model the aggregate value 
of stocks is determined as the present discounted value of expected future after-tax 
cash flow, the discount rates being the current and expected future short-term interest 
rates. The theoretical model thus implies that CG should be a function of changes in 
expected future after-tax cash flow and of changes in the current and expected future 
interest rates. In the empirical work the change in the bond rate, ARB, is used as a 
proxy for changes in expected future interest rates, and the change in after-tax profits, 
A(PIEF — TFG — TFS + PIEB — TBG — TBS), is used as a proxy for changes in 
expected future after-tax cash flow. In the estimated equation, CG and the change in 
after-tax profits are normalized by PX_1KS,_], which is a measure of potential output 
in nominal terms. Equation 25 is the estimated equation, where CG/(PX_lYS_i) is 
regressed on the constant term, ARB, and A[(PIEF — TFG — TFS + PIEB — TBG — 
TBS)y(PX_[YS_[).
The fit of equation 25 is poor. The coefficient estimates have the right sign but are 
not significant. The equation passes the lags, RHO, T, and AP tests. The variables for 
which led values were tried are the change in the bond rate and the change in after-tax 
profits. The led values are not significant. For the final /2 test ARS, the change in the 
short-term rate, was added under the view that it might also be a proxy for expected 
future interest rate changes, and it is not significant.
Chapters 5 and 6 discuss the effects of CG on the economy. It will be seen that these 
effects are large; they account for most of the unusual features of the U.S. economy in 
the last half of the 1990s. Although fluctuations in CG have large effects, the results of 
estimating equation 25 show that most of these fluctuations are not explained.
2.4.7 Interest Payments Equations
Table A19: Equation 19. INTF, interest payments—f
Table A29: Equation 29. INTG, interest payments—g
INTF is the level of net interest payments of the firm sector, and INTG is the same for 
the federal government. Data on both of these variables are NIPA data. AF is the level 
of net financial assets of the firm sector, and AG is the same for the federal government. 
Data on both of these variables are FFA data. AF and AG are negative because the firm 
sector and the federal government are net debtors, and they consist of both short-term 
and long-term securities.
The current level of interest payments depends on the amount of existing securities 
issued at each date in the past and on the relevant interest rate prevailing at each date. 
The link from AF to INTF (and from AG to INTG) is thus complicated. It depends on 
past issues and the interest rates paid on these issues. A number of approximations 
have to be made in trying to model this link, and the procedure used here is as 
follows.

2.4 || The US Stochastic Equations
41
Let RQ denote a weighted average of the current value of the short-term interest 
rate, RS, and current and past values of the long-term rate, RB, with weights of .3 
and .7:6
6. These weights were chosen after some experimentation. The results are not sensitive to this particular 
choice.
7. The reason for the summation constraint is as follows. If 0.15RQ is the interest rate that pertains to 
INTFI(—AF + 40) in the long run, then a one-unit change in Q.15RQ should result in the long run in a 
one-unit change in INTF/(—AF + 40), which is what the summation constraint imposes.
RQ — [.ST^iS1 + .I(RB + RBi + RB_2 H- RB_2 + RB_a -F RB_$
(2.31) 
+ RB_6 + T?B_7)/8]/400.
The variable INTF/(—AF) is the ratio of interest payments of the firm sector to 
the net financial debt of the firm sector. This ratio is a function of current and past 
interest rates, among other things. After some experimentation, the interest rate .I5RQ 
was chosen as the relevant interest rate for INTF/(—AF). (The weighted average in 
equation 2.31 is divided by 400 to put RQ at a quarterly rate in percentage units.) In 
the empirical specification INTF/(—AF + 40) is taken to depend on the constant term, 
T15RQ, and INTF_J(-AF_4 + 40), where the coefficients on the latter two variables 
are constrained to sum to one.7 This results in the estimation of the following equation:
N\INTF/(-AF + 40)] = cq + a2{.I5RQ
- INTF_i/(-AF+ 40)] + 6. 
(2’32)
This equation, which is equation 19, is estimated under the assumption of a first-order 
autoregressive error term. At the beginning of the sample period AF is close to zero, 
and 40 is added to it in the estimation work to lessen the sensitivity of the results to 
small values of AF.
The coefficient estimate for the interest rate variable is of the expected positive sign, 
but it is not significant. The first y2 test is of the hypothesis that the two coefficients 
sum to one, and the hypothesis is not rejected. The equation passes the RHO test, but 
it fails the lags, T, and two of the three AP tests.
Equation 2.32 was also estimated for the federal government, where INTG replaces 
INTF and AG replaces AF. (AG is large enough at the beginning of the sample period 
to make it unnecessary to add anything to it.) This is equation 29 in the model. In this 
case the equation was not estimated under the assumption of an autoregressive error 
term, although the restriction that the two coefficients sum to one was retained.
For equation 29 the interest rate variable is significant. The restriction is rejected, 
and the equation passes only the T test.
Equations 19 and 29 are important in the model because when interest rates change, 
interest payments change, which changes household income. As discussed above, it is 
difficult to model this link. Although the overall results for equations 19 and 29 are not 
strong, the equations are at least rough approximations of the links.

2.4.8 The Import Equation
Table A27: Equation 27. IM, imports
The import equation is in per capita terms and is in log form. The explanatory variables 
include per capita expenditures on consumption and investment, a price deflator for 
domestically produced goods, PF, relative to the import price deflator, PIM, and four 
dummy variables to account for two dock strikes. The equation is estimated under the 
assumption of a second-order autoregressive property of the error term.
The coefficient estimates are significant except for the estimate for the lagged 
dependent variable, which has a r-statistic of 1.90. The equation passes the lags, 
RHO, T, and AP tests. The variable for which led values were tried is the per capita 
expenditure variable, and the led values are not significant. The last y2 test in Table A27 
adds log PF to the equation, which is a test of the restriction that the coefficient of 
log PF is equal to the negative of the coefficient of log PIM. The log PF variable is not 
significant, and so the restriction is not rejected.
2.4.9 Unemployment Benefits
Table A28: Equation 28. UB, unemployment insurance benefits
Equation 28 explains unemployment insurance benefits, UB. It is in log form and 
contains as explanatory variables the level of unemployment, the nominal wage rate, 
and the lagged dependent variable. The inclusion of the nominal wage rate is designed 
to pick up the effects of increases in wages and prices on legislated benefits per 
unemployed worker. The equation is estimated under the assumption of a first-order 
autoregressive error term.
All the coefficient estimates are significant. The equation passes the lags and RHO 
tests, and it fails the T and AP tests.
2.4.10 Interest Rate Rule
Table A30: Equation 30. RS, three-month Treasury bill rate
A key question in any macro model is what one assumes about monetary policy. 
In the theoretical model monetary policy is determined by an interest rate reaction 
function or rule, and in the empirical work an equation like this is estimated. This 
equation is interpreted as an equation explaining the behavior of the Federal Reserve 
(Fed).
In one respect trying to explain Fed behavior is more difficult than, say, trying to 
explain the behavior of the household or firm sectors. Since the Fed is run by a relatively 
small number of people, there can be fairly abrupt changes in behavior if the people 
with influence change their minds or are replaced by others with different views. Abrupt 
changes are less likely to happen for the household and firm sectors because of the large 
number of decision makers in each sector. This said, however, only one abrupt change in 
behavior appears evident in the data, which is between 1979:4 and 1982:3. This period, 

2.4 || The US Stochastic Equations
43
1979:4-1982:3, will be called the “early Volcker” period.8 The stated policy of the Fed 
during this period was that it was focusing more on monetary aggregates than it had 
done before.
8. Paul Volcker was chair of the Fed between 1979:3 and 1987:2, but the period in question is only 
1979:4-1982:3.
Equation 30 is the estimated interest rate reaction function. It has on the left-hand 
side RS. This treatment is based on the assumption that the Fed has a target bill rate 
each quarter and achieves this target through manipulation of its policy instruments. 
Although in practice the Fed controls the federal funds rate, the quarterly average of 
the federal funds rate and the quarterly average of the three-month Treasury bill rate 
are so highly correlated that it makes little difference which rate is used in estimated 
interest rate rules using quarterly data. The right-hand-side variables in the equation are 
variables that seem likely to affect the target rate. The variables that were chosen are 
(1) the rate of inflation, (2) the unemployment rate, (3) the change in the unemployment 
rate, and (4) the percentage change in the money supply lagged one quarter. The break 
between 1979:4 and 1982:3 was modeled by adding the variable D794823 • PCM 1 to 
the equation, where D794823 is a dummy variable that is 1 between 1979:4 and 1982:3 
and 0 otherwise. The estimated equation also includes the lagged dependent variable 
and two lagged bill rate changes to pick up the dynamics.
The coefficient estimates in equation 30 are significant except for the estimate for the 
lagged money supply variable in the non-early Volcker period, which has a t-statistic 
of 1.88. Equation 30 is a “leaning against the wind” equation. RS is estimated to depend 
positively on the inflation rate and the lagged growth of the money supply and negatively 
on the unemployment rate and the change in the unemployment rate Adjustment and 
smoothing effects are captured by the lagged values of RS. The coefficient on lagged 
money supply growth is nearly 20 times larger for the early Volcker period than either 
before or after, which is consistent with the Fed’s stated policy of focusing more on 
monetary aggregates during this period. This way of accounting for the Fed policy 
shift does not, of course, capture the richness of the change in behavior, but at least it 
seems to capture some of the change.
Equation 30 does very well in the tests. It passes the lags, RHO, and T tests. The 
variables for which led values were tried are inflation and the unemployment rate, and 
the led values are not significant. The inflation expectations variables, pe^ and p^, 
were added to the equation, and these variables are not significant. Regarding the leads 
tests, these are tests of whether the Fed’s expectations of future values of inflation and 
the unemployment rate are rational. The fact that the led values are not significant is 
evidence against the Fed’s having rational expectations.
Regarding stability tests for equation 30, any interesting test must exclude the early 
Volcker period since any hypothesis of stability that includes it is likely to be rejected. 
The Fed announced that its behavior was different during this period. One obvious 
hypothesis to test is that the equation’s coefficients are the same before 1979:4 as they 

44
2 || The MC Model
are after 1982:3. This was done using a Wald test. The Wald statistic is presented in 
equation 3.6 in Andrews and Fair (1988). It has the advantage that it works under very 
general assumptions about the properties of the error terms and can be used when the 
estimator is 2SLS, which it is here. The Wald statistic is distributed as /2 with (in 
the present case) 8 degrees of freedom. The hypothesis of stability is not rejected. As 
reported in Table A30, the Wald statistic is 15.32, which has a /j-value of .0532.
As noted in section 1.2, the first example of an estimated interest rate rule is in 
Dewaid and Johnson (1963), followed by Christian (1968). An equation like equation 30 
was first estimated in Fair (1978). After this, McNees (1986, 1992) estimated rules in 
which some of the explanatory variables were the Fed’s internal forecasts of various 
variables. Khoury (1990) provides an extensive list of estimated rules through 1986. 
Two recent studies are Judd and Rudebusch (1998), where rules are estimated for 
various subsets of the 1970-1997 period, and Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2000), where 
rules are estimated for the different Fed chairmen.
There seems to be a general view in the recent literature that estimated interest 
rate rules do not have stable coefficient estimates over time. For example, Judd and 
Rudebusch (1998, p. 3) state, “Overall, it appears that there have not been any great 
successes in modeling Fed behavior with a single, stable reaction function.” The passing 
of the stability test for equation 30 is thus contrary this view. One likely reason that 
the stability hypothesis has generally been rejected in the literature is that most tests 
have included the early Volcker period, which is clearly different from the periods both 
before and after. The tests in Judd and Rudebusch (1998), for example, include the early 
Volcker period.
2.4.11 Additional Comments
The following are general comments about the results in Tables A1-A30, usually 
pertaining to groups of equations.
Lags, RHO, T, and Stability Tests
For the /2 tests, 27 of 30 equations pass the lags test, 24 of 29 pass the RHO test, and 
22 of 26 pass the T test. Of the 87 AP stability tests, 48 are passed. For the end-of- 
sample stability test, 27 of 30 are passed. All the overidentifying restrictions tests are 
passed. The overall results thus suggest that the specifications of the equations are fairly 
accurate regarding dynamic and trend effects. The results are less strong for the AP test, 
where for some of the equations there are signs of a changed structure in the 1970s. 
It may be useful in future work to break some of the estimation periods in parts, but 
in general it seems that more observations are needed before this might be a sensible 
strategy. Also, it will be seen in Chapter 9 that the AP test may reject too often, and so 
the AP results in Tables A1-A30 may be too pessimistic.
Rational Expectations Tests
The led values are significant at the 1 percent level in only one case: Leads +8 for 
equation 3. They are significant at the 5 percent level in only four cases: (1) Leads +1 

2.4 || The US Stochastic Equations
45
and Leads +8 in equation 1, (2) Leads +1 in equation 2, and (3) Leads +1 in equa­
tion 3. Overall, the data thus strongly reject the hypothesis that expectations are ra­
tional.
The present negative results about the RE hypothesis are consistent with Chow’s 
(1989) results, where he finds that the use of adaptive expectations performs much 
better than the use of rational expectations in explaining present value models.
Age Distribution Effects
The age variables, AG1, AG2, and AG3, are jointly significant at the 5 percent level in 
three of the four household expenditure equations, and the sign patterns are generally 
as expected. This is thus evidence that the U.S. age distribution has an effect on U.S. 
macroeconomic equations.9
9. This same conclusion was also reached in Fair and Dominguez (1991). In this earlier study, contrary 
to the case here, the age variables were also significant in the equation explaining IHH.
Excess Labor, Excess Capital, and Other Stock Effects
The excess capital variable is significant in the investment equation, 12, and the ex­
cess labor variable is significant in the employment and hours equations, 13 and 14. 
Regarding other stock effects, the stock of inventories has a negative effect on produc­
tion (equation 11), the stock of durable goods has a negative effect on durable ex­
penditures (equation 3), and the stock of housing has a negative effect on residential 
investment (equation 4).
Stock Market Effects
The real wealth variable, AA, appears in three of the four household expenditure 
equations. AA is affected by CG, which is mostly the change in the value of stocks 
held by the household sector, and so changes in stock prices affect expenditures in the 
model through their effect on household wealth. The size of this effect is discussed in 
Chapter 5. The wealth variable also appears in three of the four labor supply equations, 
where the estimated effect is negative, and so changes in stock prices also affect labor 
supply. Finally, one of the cost of capital variables in the investment equation 12 is 
a function of lagged values of CG, and so stock prices have an effect on plant and 
equipment investment through this variable.
Interest Rate Effects
Either the short-term or long-term interest rate is significant in the four household 
expenditure equations. Also, interest income is part of disposable personal income, 
KD, which is significant in the four equations. Therefore an increase in interest rates 
has a negative effect on household expenditures through the interest rate variables and a 
positive effect through the disposable personal income variable. In addition, the change 
in a long-term interest rate has a negative effect on the change in the value of stocks

46
2 || The MC Model
(equation 25), and so interest rates have a negative effect on household expenditures 
through their effect on household wealth. A long-term interest rate is significant in 
the investment equation 12, and so interest rates have a negative effect on plant and 
equipment investment through this variable. The short-term interest rate also appears 
in the three demand-for-money equations.
Money Demand Adjustment
In all three money demand equations the nominal adjustment specification domi­
nates the real adjustment specification. The nominal adjustment specification is equa­
tion 2.28.
Unemployment Rate
The unemployment rate is significant in two of the four labor supply equations and 
nearly significant in one of the other two. There is thus some evidence that a discouraged 
worker effect is in operation. The unemployment rate is the demand pressure variable in 
the price equation 10 and is highly significant. The unemployment rate and the change 
in the unemployment rate are significant in equation 30, the estimated interest rate 
rule.
Price of Imports
The price of imports, PIM, is an explanatory variable in the price equation 10, where it 
has a positive effect on the domestic price level. It also appears in the import equation 27, 
where it has a negative effect on imports, other things being equal.
Potential Productivity
Potential productivity, LAM, is exogenous in the model. It is constructed from apeak-to- 
peak interpolation of measured productivity. It appears in the price and wage equations 
10 and 16. It is also used in the definition of JHMIN, which appears in the employment 
and hours equations 13 and 14, and it is in the definition of potential output, YS.
Dummy Variables
A dummy variable appears in equations 9 and 17 to account for a possible data error. 
Three dummy variables appear in equation 11 to account for a steel strike; one dummy 
variable appears in equation 13 to account for the same steel strike; and four dummy 
variables appear in equation 27 to account for two dock strikes. A dummy variable 
appears in equation 30 to account for the announced change in Fed behavior in the 
early Volcker period. Finally, nine dummy variables appear in equation 21 to account 
for depreciation tax law changes.

2.5 The ROW Stochastic Equations
2.5.1 Introduction
Stochastic equations are estimated for 38 countries aside from the United States, with 
up to 15 equations estimated per country. The estimates and test results are presented in 
Tables Bl through B15 in Table B.4 in Appendix B. The 2SLS technique was used for 
the quarterly countries and for equations 1, 2, and 3 for the annual countries. Ordinary 
least squares was used for the other equations for the annual countries. The 2SLS 
technique had to be used sparingly for the annual countries because of the limited 
number of observations. The first-stage regressors for each equation are listed on the 
website mentioned in section 1.8.
The estimation periods were chosen on the basis of data availability. With three 
exceptions, the periods were chosen to use all the available data. The three exceptions 
are the interest rate, exchange rate, and forward rate equations, where the estimation 
periods were chosen to begin after the advent of floating exchange rates. The earliest 
starting quarter (year) for these periods was 1972:2 (1972). For the EMU countries 
the estimation periods for the interest rate, exchange rate, and forward rate equations 
end in 1998:4. Because the EMU countries have had a common monetary policy since 
1999:1, there are no longer individual interest rate, exchange rate, and forward rate 
equations for these countries. The end-of-sample stability test was not performed for 
these equations for the EMU countries.
No dummy variables are used for the ROW model except for Germany. Four dummy 
variables were added to the estimated equations for Germany except for equations 
7-10. The first dummy variable is 1 in 1990:3 and 0 otherwise; the second is 1 in 
1990:4 and 0 otherwise; the third is 1 in 1991:1 and 0 otherwise; and the fourth is 1 
in 1991:2 and 0 otherwise. These were added to pick up any effects of the German 
reunification. To save space, the coefficient estimates of the dummy variables are not 
presented in the tables. As noted in section 1.5, the coefficient estimates of the dummy 
variables were taken as fixed when performing the AP and end-of-sample stability 
tests.
The tests per equation are similar to those done for the US equations. Remember 
from section 1.5 that for the AP test is taken to be 40 quarters or 10 years after 
the first observation and T2 is taken to be 40 quarters or 10 years before the last 
observation. For the end-of-sample stability test the end period begins 12 quarters 
or 3 years before the last observation. For the serial correlation test the order of the 
autoregressive process was two for the quarterly countries and one for the annual 
countries. (For the test for the United States the order was four.) The led values were 
one-quarter-ahead values for the quarterly countries and one-year-ahead values for the 
annual countries. Subject to data limitations, the specification of the ROW equations 
follows fairly closely the specification of the US equations. Data limitations prevented 
all 15 equations from being estimated for all 38 countries. In addition, some equations 
for some countries were initially estimated and then rejected for giving what seemed 
to be poor results.

2 || The MC Model
One important difference between the US and ROW models is that the asset variable 
A for each country in the ROW model measures only the net asset position of the country 
vis-a-vis the rest of the world; it does not include the domestic wealth of the country. 
Also, the asset variable is divided by PY • YS before it is entered as an explanatory 
variable in the equations. (PY is the GDP price deflator and YS is an estimate of 
potential real GDP.) This was done even for equations that were otherwise in log form. 
As discussed in Appendix B, the asset variable is off by a constant amount, and so 
taking logs of the variable is not appropriate. Entering the variable in ratio form in the 
equations allows the error to be approximately absorbed in the estimate of the constant 
term.10 This procedure is, of course, crude, but at least it responds somewhat to the 
problem caused by the level error in A.
10. Let [Af-dtPYf-Y • ySAdf' denote the correct variable for period t — 1, and let [At_J(PY t_{ • 
ySf.p] denote the measured variable. Under the assumption that 8 = [At_l/(PYt_l • yS’f_1)f' — 
[At_}/(PYt_} • YSt_])] is constant for all t, the measurement error is absorbed in the constant term.
Because much of the specification of the ROW equations is close to that of the US 
equations, the specification discussion in this section is brief. Only the differences are 
emphasized.
A dagger (f) after a coefficient estimate in Tables B1-B15 indicates that the variable 
is lagged one period. To save space, only the /^-values are presented for each test in the 
tables except for the AP stability test. As for the US equations, an equation will be 
said to pass a test if the p-value is greater than 01. For the AP stability test the AP 
value is presented along with the degrees of freedom and the value of lambda. The AP 
value has an asterisk (*)  in front of it if it is significant at the 1 percent level, which 
means that the equation fails the stability test. No tests are performed for countries 
AR, BR, and PE because of very short estimation periods (for country abbreviations, 
see Table B.l). Also, stability tests are not performed for countries with very short 
estimation periods.
There are obviously many estimates and test results in the tables, and it is not feasible 
to discuss each estimate and test result in detail. The following discussion tries to give 
a general idea of the results.
2.5.2 The Equations and Tests
Table Bl: Equation 1. IM, total imports
Equation 1 explains the total real per capita imports of the country. The explanatory 
variables include the price of domestic goods relative to the price of imports, per 
capital expenditures on consumption plus investment plus government spending, and 
the lagged dependent variable. The variables are in logs. Equation 1 is similar to 
equation 27 in the US model. The main difference is that the expenditure variable 
includes government spending, which it does not in equation 27.
The coefficient estimate for the expenditure variable is of the expected sign for all 
countries, and many of the estimates of the coefficient of the relative price variable are 

2.5 || The ROW Stochastic Equations
49
significant. Equation 1 does fairly well for the lags test, where there are 6 failures out 
of 31, and for the end-of-sample stability test, where there is only 1 failure out of 28. 
However, for the RHO test there are 16 failures out of 31, for the T test there are 14 
failures out of 31, for the AP stability test there are 23 failures out of 30, and for the 
overid test there are 10 failures out of 15. There is one other test in Table Bl. For the 
countries in which the relative price variable was used, the log of the domestic price 
level was added to test the relative price constraint. The constraint was rejected (that 
is, log PY was significant) in 6 of the 24 cases.
Table B2: Equation 2. C, consumption
Equation 2 explains real per capita consumption. The explanatory variables include 
the short-term or long-term interest rate, per capita income, the lagged value of 
real per capita assets, and the lagged dependent variable. The variables are in logs 
except for the interest rates and the asset variable. Equation 2 is similar to the con­
sumption equations in the US model. The two main differences are (1) there is 
only one category of consumption in the ROW model compared with three in the 
US model and (2) the income variable is total GDP instead of disposable personal 
income.
The income variable is significant for almost all countries, and the interest rate and 
asset variables are significant for many countries. The interest rates in these equations 
provide a key link from monetary policy changes to changes in real demand. Regarding 
the tests, 4 of 34 fail the lags test, 10 of 34 fail the RHO test, 12 of 34 fail the T test, 17 
of 33 fail the AP test, 2 of 31 fail the end-of-sample test, and 9 of 20 fail the overid test. 
The led value of the income variable was used for the leads test, and it is significant in 
only 3 of 34 cases.
Table B3: Equation 3.1, fixed investment
Equation 3 explains real fixed investment. It includes as explanatory variables the 
lagged value of investment, the current value of output, and the short-term or long­
term interest rate. The variables are in logs except for the interest rates. Equation 3 
differs from the investment equation 12 for the US, which uses a capital stock se­
ries. Sufficient data are not available to allow good capital stock series to be con­
structed for most of the other countries, and so no capital stock series were constructed 
for the ROW model. The simpler equation just mentioned was estimated for each 
country.
The output variable is significant for most countries, and an interest rate variable is 
significant for many. Again, the interest rates in these equations provide a key link from 
monetary policy changes to changes in real demand, in this case investment demand. 
Regarding the tests, 17 of 33 fail the lags test, 20 of 33 fail the RHO test, 17 of 33 fail 
the T test, 19 of 31 fail the AP test, 3 of 30 fail the end-of-sample test, and 5 of 17 
fail the overid test. The dynamic and trend properties are thus not well captured in a 
number of cases. The led value of output was used for the leads test, and in only 2 of 
33 cases is the led value significant.

50
2 || The MC Model
Table B4: Equation 4. Y, production
Equation 4 explains the level of production. It is the same as equation 11 for the US 
model—see equation 2.10. It includes as explanatory variables the lagged level of 
production, the current level of sales, and the lagged stock of inventories.
The value of X presented in Table B4 is one minus the coefficient estimate of 
lagged production. Also presented in the table are the implied values of a and fl in 
equation 2.10. For the quarterly countries A ranges from 0.331 to 0.853 and a ranges 
from 0.056 to 0.421. For the annual countries A ranges from 0.534 to 0.974 and a ranges 
from 0.023 to 0.094. For the United States X was 0.683 and a was 0.353.
Equation 4 does well in the tests except for the AP test. Two of 10 equations fail the 
lags test, 2 of 10 fail the RHO test, none of 10 fail the T test, 7 of 10 fail the AP test, 
and none of 10 fail the end-of-sample test. The led value of sales was used for the leads 
test, and in only 2 of 10 cases is the led value significant.
As was the case for equation 11 in the US model, the coefficient estimates of 
equation 4 are consistent with the view that firms smooth production relative to sales, 
and so these results add support to the production smoothing hypothesis.
Table B5: Equation 5. PY, price deflator
Equation 5 explains the GDP price deflator. It is the same as equation 10 for the 
US model except for the use of different demand pressure variables. It includes as 
explanatory variables the lagged price level, the price of imports, the nominal wage 
rate (when available), a demand pressure variable, and the time trend.
Three demand pressure variables were tried per country. The first is the output gap 
variable, ZZ, which equals (YS — Y)/YS, where Y is actual output and YS is a measure 
of potential output. The construction of YS is discussed in Appendix B. For the second 
variable, log Yt was regressed on the constant term and t, and log Yt — log Yt was taken 
as the demand pressure variable, where log Yt is the predicted value from the regression. 
The third variable is the unemployment rate when data for it are available. The demand 
pressure variable whose coefficient estimate was of the expected sign and had the largest 
/-statistic in absolute value was chosen per country.
The estimates of the final specification of equation 5 are presented in Table B5. 
A demand pressure variable (denoted DP in the table) appears in 27 of the 32 cases. 
(The note to Table B5 indicates which demand pressure variable was chosen for each 
equation.) The price of imports appears in all but 3 cases, and in most cases it is 
significant. Import prices thus appear to have important effects on domestic prices for 
most countries.
The results of two lags tests are reported in Table B5. The first is the usual test, and 
the second is one in which an extra lag is added for each variable. Equation 5 does 
fairly well in the tests except for the AP test. Seven of 32 equations fail the first lags 
test, 11 of 32 fail the second lags test, 9 of 32 fail the RHO test, 20 of 30 fail the 
AP test, 1 of 29 fails the end-of-sample test, and 5 of 13 fail the overid test. The led 
value of the wage rate was used for the leads test, and in 3 of 7 cases the led value is 
significant.

2.5 || The ROW Stochastic Equations

Table B6: Equation 6. M1, money
Equation 6 explains the per capita demand for money. It is the same as equation 9 for the 
US model. The same nominal versus real adjustment specifications were tested here as 
were tested for US equation 9 (and for the US equations 17 and 26). Equation 6 includes 
as explanatory variables one of the two lagged money variables, depending on which 
adjustment specification won, the short-term interest rate, and income.
The estimates in Table B6 show that the nominal adjustment specification was 
chosen in 12 of the 20 cases. The equation does well in the tests except for the AP 
test. One of 20 equations fails the lags test, 4 of 20 fail the RHO test, 5 of 20 fail the T 
test, 11 of 20 fail the AP test, 1 of 19 fails the end-of-sample test, and 1 of 9 fails the 
overid test. The first test in the table (N versus R) adds the other lagged money variable 
(that is, the lagged money variable not chosen for the final specification). Only for the 
United Kingdom is the variable significant. For the United Kingdom both variables are 
significant when included together.
As was the case for the United States, the demand-for-money equations for the other 
countries are presented for sake of completeness only. The short-term interest rate in a 
country is determined by the interest rate rule (equation 7 next), and the money supply 
is whatever is needed to have the money demand equation met.
Table B7: Equation 7. RS, short-term interest rate
Equation 7 explains the short-term (three-month) interest rate. It is interpreted as 
the interest rate rule of each country’s monetary authority, and it is similar to equa­
tion 30 in the US model. For the EMU countries the equation is only relevant for 
the period through 1998:4. The explanatory variables that were tried (as possibly in­
fluencing the monetary authority’s interest rate decision) are (1) the rate of inflation, 
(2) the output gap variable ZZ, (3) the German short-term interest rate (for the Euro­
pean countries only), and (4) the U.S. short-term interest rate. The U.S. interest rate 
was included on the view that some monetary authorities’ decisions may be influ­
enced by the Fed’s decisions. Similarly, the German interest rate was included in the 
(non-German) European equations on the view that the (non-German) European mon­
etary authorities’ decisions may be influenced by the decisions of the German cen­
tral bank.
Table B7 shows that the inflation rate is included in 16 of the 24 cases, ZZ in 12 
cases, the German rate in 7 cases, and the U.S. rate in 17 cases. There is thus evidence 
that monetary authorities are influenced by inflation and demand pressure. Equation 7 
does well in the tests. One of the 24 equations fails the lags test, 2 of 24 fail the RHO 
test, 2 of 24 fail the T test, 6 of 24 fail the AP test, none of 14 fail the end-of-sample 
test, and 5 of 13 fail the overid test.
Three important countries in the MC model are Japan, Germany, and the United 
Kingdom. The inflation rate and ZZ appear in each of the estimated rules for these 
countries. The equations pass all the tests except the T test for the United Kingdom. 
Also, the U.S. rate affects each of the three rates, and in this sense the United States is 
the monetary policy leader.

2 || The MC Model
Equation 7 for EU is explained at the end of this section. It is only relevant from 
1999:1 on.
Table B8: Equation 8. RB, long-term interest rate
Equation 8 explains the long-term interest rate. It is the same as equations 23 and 24 
in the US model. For the EMU countries the equation is only relevant for the period 
through 1998:4. For the quarterly countries the explanatory variables include the lagged 
dependent variable and the current and two lagged short rates. For the annual countries 
the explanatory variables include the lagged dependent variable and the current and one 
lagged short rates. The same restriction was imposed on equation 8 as was imposed on 
equations 23 and 24, namely that the coefficients on the short rate sum to one in the 
long run.
The first test in Table B8 shows that the restriction that the coefficients sum to one 
is only rejected in 2 of the 20 cases. The equation does well in the other tests. Three of 
the 20 equations fail the lags test, 1 of 20 fails the RHO test, 5 of 20 fail the T test, 5 of 
20 fail the AP test, none of 13 fail the end-of-sample test, and 1 of 12 fails the overid 
test. The led value of the short-term interest rate was used for the leads test, and it is 
not significant in any of the 19 cases.11
11. Collinearity problems prevented the leads test form being performed for Korea.
Equation 8 for EU is explained at the end of this section. It is only relevant from 
1999:1 on.
Table B9: Equation 9. E or H, exchange rate
Equation 9 explains the country’s exchange rate: E for the non-European countries plus 
Germany and H for the non-German European countries. E is a country’s exchange rate 
relative to the U.S. dollar, and H is a country’s exchange rate relative to the Deutsche 
mark (DM). An increase in E is a depreciation of the country’s currency relative to 
the dollar, and an increase in H is a depreciation of the country’s currency relative to 
the DM. For the EMU countries the equation is only relevant for the period through 
1998:4.
The theory behind the specification of equation 9 is discussed in Fair (1994), 
Chapter 2. Equation 9 is interpreted as an exchange rate reaction function. The equations 
for E and H have the same general specification except that U.S. variables are the base 
variables for the E equations and German variables are the base variables for the H 
equations. The following discussion will focus on E.
It will first be useful to define two variables:
r = [(1 + RS/100)/(l + RSus/100)]25, 
(2.33)
p = PY/PYus. 
(2.34)
The variable r is a relative interest rate measure. RS is the country’s short-term interest 
rate, and RSus is the U.S. short-term interest rate (denoted simply RS in the US model).

2.5 || The ROW Stochastic Equations
53
RS and RSus are divided by 100 in the definition of r because they are in percentage 
points rather than in percents. Also, the interest rates are at annual rates, and so the 
term in brackets in the definition of r is raised to the 0.25 power to put r at a quarterly 
rate. For the annual countries 0.25 is not used. The variable p is the relative price level, 
where PY is the country’s GDP price deflator and PYus is the U.S. GDP price deflator 
(denoted GDPD in the US model).12
12. The relative interest rate is defined the way it is so that logs can be used in the specification below. 
This treatment relies on the fact that the log of 1 + x is approximately x for small values of x.
The equation for E is based on the following two equations.
E*  = otpr?, 
(2.35)
E/E_y = (E^E-rf-f. 
(2.36)
Equation 2.35 states that the long-run exchange rate, E*,
 depends on the relative price 
level, p, and the relative interest rate, r. The coefficient on the relative price level 
is constrained to be one, which means that in the long run the real exchange rate is 
assumed merely to fluctuate as the relative interest rate fluctuates. Equation 2.36 is a 
partial adjustment equation, which says that the actual exchange rate adjusts A, percent 
of the way to the long-run exchange rate each period.
Equations 2.35 and 2.36 imply that
log(E/E_1) = A. log a + A(log p - log E_l) + A/3 log r + e. (2.37)
The restriction that the coefficient of the relative price term is one can be tested by adding 
log E_{ to equation 2.37. If the coefficient is other than one, this variable should have 
a nonzero coefficient. This is one of the tests performed in Table B9.
The equations for the European countries (except Germany) are the same as above 
with H replacing E, RSGE replacing RSus, and PYGE replacing PYVs-
Exchange rate equations were estimated for 25 countries. For a number of countries 
the estimate of the coefficient of the relative interest rate variable was of the wrong 
expected sign, and in these cases the relative interest rate variable was dropped from 
the equation. Also, for 7 countries—CA, JA, AU, IT, NE, UK, SO—the estimate of X 
in equation 2.37 was very small (“very small” defined to be less than 0.025), and for 
these countries the equation was reestimated with A. constrained to be 0.050.
The unconstrained estimates of X in the equation vary from 0.053 to 0.233 for the 
quarterly countries and from 0.071 to 0.489 for the annual countries. A small value 
for A. means that it takes considerable time for the exchange rate to adjust to a relative 
price level change. The relative interest rate variable appears in 7 equations. It is only 
significant in 2 (CA andNE), however, so there is only limited support for the hypothesis 
that relative interest rates affect exchange rates.
The first test in Table B9 is of the restriction discussed above. The restriction is 
tested by adding log E_{ or log H_{ to the equation. It is rejected in 8 of the 25 cases. 
For the other tests, 7 of the 25 equations fail the lags test, 9 of 25 fail the RHO test, 10 

54
2 || The MC Model
of 25 fail the T test, 8 of 24 fail the AP test, none of 13 fail the end-of-sample test, and 
3 of 12 fail the overid test.
Since equation 9 is in log form, the standard errors are roughly in percentage terms. 
The standard errors for a number of the European countries are quite low, but remember 
that these are standard errors for H, not E. The variance of H is much smaller than the 
variance of E for the European countries.
The relative interest rate variable appears in the equations for Japan, Germany, and 
the United Kingdom, and so relative interest rates have an effect on the exchange rates of 
these three key countries in the model. As noted above, however, they are not significant, 
and so the relative interest rate effects are at best weak.
Equation 9 for EU is explained at the end of this section. It is only relevant from 
1999:1 on.
Table BIO: Equation 10. F, forward rate
Equation 10 explains the country’s forward exchange rate, F. This equation is the 
estimated arbitrage condition, and although it plays no role in the model, it is of interest 
to see how closely the quarterly data on EE, F, RS, and RSus match the arbitrage 
condition. (EE differs from E in that it is the exchange rate at the end of the period, not 
the average for the period.) The arbitrage condition in this notation is
F/EE = [(1 + RS/100)/( 1 + RSus/ 100)]'25ee. 
(2.38)
In equation 10, log F is regressed on log EE and .25 log(l + E5/100)/(l + 
EST/s/100). If the arbitrage condition were met exactly, the coefficient estimates for 
both explanatory variables would be one and the fit would be perfect.
The results in Table B10 show that the data are generally consistent with the arbitrage 
condition, especially considering that some of the interest rate data are not exactly the 
right data to use. Note the ^-statistic for Switzerland of 14,732.73! Equation 10 plays 
no role in the model because E does not appear in any other equation.
Table Bll: Equation 11. PX, export price index
Equation 11 explains the export price index, PX. It provides a link from the GDP price 
deflator, PY, to the export price index. Export prices are needed when the countries are 
linked together. If a country produced only one good, then the export price would be the 
domestic price and only one price equation would be needed. In practice, of course, a 
country produces many goods, only some of which are exported. If a country is a price 
taker with respect to its exports, then its export prices would just be the world prices of 
the export goods. To try to capture the in-between case where a country has some effect 
on its export prices but not complete control over every price, the following equation 
is postulated:
PX = PYx[PW$(E/E95)]l~xeF 
(2.39)
PVk$ is the world price index in dollars, and so PW$(E/E95) is the world price index 
in local currency. Equation 2.39 thus takes PX to be a weighted average of PY and the 

2.5 || The ROW Stochastic Equations
55
world price index in local currency, where the weights sum to one. Equation 11 was not 
estimated for any of the major oil exporting countries, and so PW$ was constructed to 
be net of oil prices. (See equations L-5 in Table B.3.)
Equation 2.39 was estimated in the following form:
log PX - \og[PW$(E/E95)] = A[log PY - log[P W$(E/E95)] + e. (2.40)
The restriction that the weights sum to one and that P W$ and E have the same coefficient 
(that is, that their product enters the equation) can be tested by adding log PY and log E 
to equation 2.40. If this restriction is not met, these variables should be significant. This 
is one of the tests performed in Table B11.
Equation 11 was estimated for 32 countries. For 2 of the countries—SY and MA— 
the estimate of X was greater than 1, and for these cases the equation was reestimated 
with X constrained to be 1. When A is 1, there is a one-to-one link between PX and PY. 
For 7 of the countries—GR, PO, CH, AR, CE, ME, and PE—the estimate of A was less 
than 0, and for these countries the equation was reestimated with only the constant term 
as an explanatory variable. When this is done, there is a one-to-one link between PX 
and PW$(E/E95). Equation 11 was estimated under the assumption of a second-order 
autoregressive error term.
The results in Table B11 show that the estimates of the autoregressive parameters are 
generally large. The estimates of A vary from 0.274 to 0.854 for the quarterly countries 
and from 0.076 to 0.870 for the annual countries. The first test in Table B11 is of the 
restriction discussed above. The restriction is rejected in 14 of the 32 cases. The equation 
fails the AP test in 9 of 30 cases. It fails the end-of-sample test in 1 of 28 cases.
It should be kept in mind that equation 11 is meant only as a rough approximation. 
If more disaggregated data were available, one would want to estimate separate price 
equations for each good, where some goods’ prices would be strongly influenced by 
world prices and others would not. This type of disaggregation is beyond the scope of 
the model.
Table B12: Equation 12. W, wage rate
Equation 12 explains the wage rate. It is similar to equation 16 for the US model. 
It includes as explanatory variables the lagged wage rate, the current price level, the 
lagged price level, a demand pressure variable, and the time trend. The same restriction 
imposed on the price and wage equations in the US model is also imposed here. Given 
the coefficient estimates of equation 5, the restriction is imposed on the coefficients in 
equation 12 so that the implied real wage equation does not have the real wage depend 
on either the nominal wage rate or the price level separately. The same searching for 
the best demand pressure variable was done for the wage equation as was done for the 
price equation.
The estimates of equation 12 show only mild support for the demand pressure 
variables having an effect on the wage rate. A demand pressure variable (denoted DW 
in the table) appears in 5 of the 7 equations, but it is significant in only 2 of them. The 
test results show that the real wage restriction is rejected in 2 of the 7 cases. None of 

56
2 || The MC Model
the 7 equations fail the lags test, none of 7 fail the RHO test, 6 of 7 fail the AP test, 1 of 
7 fails the end-of-sample test, and 1 of 5 fails the overid test. The test results are thus 
good except for the AP results, which are poor.
Table B13: Equation 13. J, employment
Equation 13 explains the change in employment. It is in log form, and it is similar 
to equation 13 for the US model. It includes as explanatory variables the amount of 
excess labor on hand, the change in output, and the time trend. It also includes the 
lagged change in output for CA. It does not include the lagged change in employment, 
which US equation 13 does.
Most of the coefficient estimates for the excess labor variable are significant in 
Table B13, which is support for the theory that firms at times hold excess labor and 
that the amount of excess labor on hand affects current employment decisions. Most of 
the change in output terms is also significant. Regarding the tests, 6 of the 14 equations 
fail the lags test, 5 of 14 fail the RHO test, 7 of 14 fail the AP test, none of 14 fail the 
end-of-sample test, and 6 of 9 fail the overid test. The led value of the change in output 
was used for the leads tests, and it is significant in only one case.
Table B14: Equation 14. LI, labor force-men
Table B15: Equation 15. L2, labor force-women
Equations 14 and 15 explain the labor force participation rates of men and women, 
respectively. They are in log form and are similar to equations 5, 6, and 7 in the US 
model. The explanatory variables include the real wage; the labor constraint variable, 
Z; the time trend; and the lagged dependent variable. The construction of Z is explained 
in Appendix B. Z is used instead of UR in the ROW model to try to pick up discouraged 
worker effects.
Z is significant in a number of cases for equations 14 and 15, which provides 
some support for the discouraged worker effect. The real wage appears in 2 cases for 
equation 14 and in 3 cases for equation 15. When the real wage appeared in the equation, 
the log of the price level, log PY, was added to the equation for one of the tests to test 
the real wage restriction. Tables B14 and B15 show that log PY is significant (and thus 
the restriction rejected) in 2 of the 5 cases.
In Table Bl4, 5 of the 14 equations fail the lags test, 2 of 14 fail the RHO test, 7 
of 14 fail the AP test, none of 14 fail the end-of-sample test, and 3 of 9 fail the overid 
test. In Table B15, 2 of the 12 equations fail the lags test, 2 of 12 fail the RHO test, 
7 of 12 fail the AP test, none of 12 fail the end-of-sample test, and 4 of 8 fail the 
overid test.

other EU variables that are used are functions of these six variables. Data on the first

EU is taken to be the sum of Y for the six quarterly EU countries: GE, AU, FR, IT, NE, 
and FI. The annual countries that are excluded are BE, IR, PO, SP, and GR. Similarly, 
KS1 for EU is taken to be the sum of KS1 for the six quarterly EU countries. PY for EU 
is the ratio of nominal output to real output for the six countries.
There are three estimated EU equations, explaining RS, RB, and E. These are 
equations 7, 8, and 9. The estimates are presented at the top of Tables B7, B8, and B9. 
The estimation period is 1972:2-2001:3 for equation 7, 1970:1-2001:4 for equation 8, 
and 1972:2-2001:4 for equation 9. German data are used prior to 1999:1, and a dummy 
variable that is 1 in 1999:1 and 0 otherwise is added to each equation to pick up any 
transition effects. The coefficient estimates of the dummy variable are not presented in 
the tables. PY for EU appears in equations 7 and 9. The EU output gap variable, ZZ, 
appears in equation 7. It is equal to (YS — Y)/YS, where Y and YS are the EU variables 
discussed above.
Remember that equation 7 for Germany is the estimated interest rate rule of the 
Bundesbank when it determined German monetary policy (through 1998:4). The use of 
German data prior to 1999:1 to estimate equation 7 for the EU means that the behavior 
of the European Central Bank (ECB) is assumed to be the same as the behavior of 
the Bundesbank except that the right-hand-side variables are EU variables rather than 
German ones. Likewise, the structure of the EU exchange rate equation 9 is assumed 
to be the same as the German equation except that the right-hand-side variables are 
changed from German ones to EU ones. The same is also true of the long-run interest 
rate equation 8.
Using only the six quarterly EU countries to construct Y, YS, and PY means that 
implicit in equation 7 is the assumption that the ECB only takes these six countries into 
account when setting its monetary policy. Although most of EU output is from the six 
quarterly countries, in future work the other countries should be included. This was not 
done here because of the lack of good quarterly data for the other countries.
The estimates in the three tables show that the estimates for EU are close to the 
estimates for Germany alone. This is, of course, not surprising since the EU equations 
have only 11 or 12 additional observations. These three equations are relevant from 
1999:1 on; they play no role in the model prior to this time. When these three equations 
are relevant, equations 7, 8, and 9 for the individual EU countries are not part of the 
model. See Table B.3 for more detail.
The Trade Share Equations
The variable is the fraction of country i’s exports imported by j in period t, where i 
runs from 1 to 58 and j runs from 1 to 59. The data on are quarterly, with observations 
for most i, j pairs beginning in 1960:1.
One would expect to depend on country z’s export price relative to an index 
of export prices of all the other countries. The empirical work consisted of trying to 

58
2 || The MC Model
estimate the effects of relative prices on aift. A separate equation was estimated for 
each z, j pair. The equation is the following:
58
aijt flij i “h Pij2aijt— \ “h 
Q ' akj“h uijt? 
>.
k=l 
U-41J
t = 1, • • • , T.
PX$it is the price index of country z’s exports, and 52^ akjtPX$kt is an index of all 
countries’ export prices, where the weight for a given country k is the share of k’s 
exports to j in the total imports of j. (In this summation k = i is skipped.)
With i running from 1 to 58, j running from 1 to 59, and not counting i = j, there 
are 3,364 (— 58 x 58) z, j pairs. There are thus 3,364 potential trade share equations to 
estimate. In fact, only 1,488 trade share equations were estimated. Data did not exist for 
all pairs and all quarters, and if fewer than 26 observations were available for a given 
pair, the equation was not estimated for that pair. A few other pairs were excluded 
because at least some of the observations seemed extreme and likely suffering from 
measurement error. Almost all of these cases were for the smaller countries.
Each of the 1,488 equations was estimated by ordinary least squares. The main 
coefficient of interest is j0z/3, the coefficient of the relative price variable. Of the 
1,488 estimates of this coefficient, 1^.1 percent (1,111) were of the expected negative 
sign. A total of 33.3 percent had the correct sign and a t-statistic greater than two in 
absolute value, and 56.2 percent had the correct sign and a /"-statistic greater than one 
in absolute value. A total of 5.8 percent had the wrong sign and a t-statistic greater 
than two, and 12.8 percent had the wrong sign and a /-statistic greater than one. The 
overall results are thus quite supportive of the view that relative prices affect trade 
shares.
The average of the 1,111 estimates of ^3 that were of the right sign is —0.0136. /3Z7-3 
measures the short-run effect of a relative price change on the trade share. The long-run 
effect is ^3/(1 — ftij?), and the average of the 1,111 values of this is —0.0716.
The trade share equations with the wrong sign for /3;-7-3 were not used in the solution 
of the model. The trade shares for these z, j pairs were taken to be exogenous.
In the solution of the model the predicted values of say, do not obey the 
property that ^2^ 
— 1. Unless this property is obeyed, the sum of total world
exports will not equal the sum of total world imports. For solution purposes each az/7 
was divided by 52^ &ijt, and this adjusted figure was used as the predicted trade share. 
In other words, the values predicted by the equations in 2.41 were adjusted to satisfy 
the requirement that the trade shares sum to one.
2.5.3 Additional Comments
Lags, RHO, T, Stability Tests
The equations do moderately well for the lags, RHO, and T tests. For the lags test there 
are 65 failures out of 276 cases (23.6 percent); for the RHO test there are 84 failures out 

2.5 || The ROW Stochastic Equations
59
of 256 (32.8 percent); and for the T test there are 73 failures out of 229 (31.9 percent). 
These results suggest that the dynamic specifications of the equations are reasonably 
good. The results are not strong for the AP stability test, where there are 151 failures 
out of 299 (50.5 percent). More observations are probably needed before much can be 
done about this problem. The end-of-sample stability test results, on the other hand, are 
quite good, with only 10 failures out of 261 (3.8 percent). For the overid test there are 
53 failures out of 142 (37.3 percent).
Rational Expectations Tests
There is little support for the use of the led values and thus little support for the rational 
expectations hypothesis. The led values are significant in only 11 out of 117 cases (9.4 
percent).
Excess Labor and Other Stock Effects
The excess labor variable is significant in most of the employment equations 13. The 
stock of inventories is significant in most of the production equations 4.
Wealth Effects
The wealth variable, A, which is the country’s net stock of foreign security and reserve 
holdings, appears in 8 of the consumption equations 2.
Interest Rate Effects
Either the short-term or long-term interest rate appears in most of the consumption and 
investment equations 2 and 3. The short-term interest rate also appears in the demand 
for money equations 6. The relative interest rate appears in 7 of the exchange rate 
equations 9. The U.S. short-term interest rate appears in 17 of the interest rate rules 7, 
and the German short-term interest rate appears in 7 of the rules.
Money Demand Adjustment
The nominal adjustment specification dominates the real adjustment specification in 12 
of the 20 cases for the money demand equations 6.
Demand Pressure Variables
A demand pressure variable appears in nearly all the price equations 5 and the wage 
equations 12. The gap variable, ZZ, appears in many of the interest rate rules 7. The 
labor constraint variable, Z, appears in most of the labor supply equations 14 and 15.
Price of Imports
The price of imports, PM, appears in all but one of the price equations 10. It also appears 
in all but four of the import equations 1.

60 
2 || The MC Model
Potential Productivity
Potential productivity, LAM, is exogenous in the model. It is constructed from a peak- 
to-peak interpolation of measured productivity, Y / J. It appears in the price and wage 
equations 5 and 12. It is also used in the definition of JMIN, which appears in the 
employment equations 13, and it is in the definition of potential output, YS.
Dummy Variables
Dummy variables appear only in some of the German equations and in the three EU 
equations.

Interest Rate Effects
3.1 Introduction
This is a short chapter, but it contains an important set of empirical results.1 It will 
be seen that the data rather strongly support the use of nominal over real interest 
rates in most expenditure equations. This chapter uses the consumption and investment 
equations of the MC model to test for nominal versus real interest rate effects. The 
aim of the tests is to see if the interest rates that households and firms use in their 
decision-making processes are better approximated by nominal or real rates.
1. The results in this chapter are updates of those in Fair (2002).
3.2 The Test
The test is as follows. For period t, let it denote the nominal interest rate, rt the real 
interest rate, and pe the expected future rate of inflation, where the horizon for pet 
matches the horizon for it. By definition rt = it — per Consider the specification of 
a consumption or investment equation in which the following appears on the right­
hand side:
aq + fipet.
For the real interest rate specification a = —and for the nominal interest rate spec­
ification — 0. The real interest rate specification can be tested by adding p? to an 
equation with it — pet included, and the nominal interest rate specification can be tested 
by adding pet to an equation with it included. The added variable should have a coeffi­
cient of zero if the specification is correct, and one can test for this.
Four measures of pet were tried for countries with quarterly data (all at annual rates). 
Two of these have already been used for the tests in Chapter 2, namely pe^, which 
is Pt/Pt_^ — 1, and p$ , which is (Pf/Pz_8)’5 — 1, where Pt denotes the price level

for quarter t. The other two measures used in this chapter are the one-quarter change, 
(Pt/Pt_fl^ — 1, and the two-quarter change led once, (Pt+\/PT_\)2 * * — 1. Three measures 
were tried for countries with only annual data: the one-year change, Pt/Pt_\ — 1, the 
two-year change, (Pt/Pt-2)'5 ~ t and the two-year change led once, (Pt+i/Pt_i)'5 — 1, 
where Pt denotes the price level for year t.
2. There is a potential bias from starting with equations chosen using nominal rather than real interest
rates. Some experimentation was done to see if other equations would be added if real interest rates were
used first, but no further equations were found.
The results of the tests are presented in Tables 3.1 and 3.2. The equations that are 
tested are the ones in Tables Al, A2, A3, A4, Al 2, B2, and B3. An equation was tested if 
the absolute value of the t-statistic of the coefficient estimate of the nominal interest rate 
variable was greater than 1.5. Except for US investment equation 12, nominal interest 
rates are used in the equations.2 In Table 3.1 the p-value is presented for each equation

and each measure of p* 
*. Columns a, b, c, and d correspond to the four measures of p*. 
Table 3.2 presents estimates of both a and fl for each case. It also presents the estimate 
of a when no measure of pet is included, which is the specification used in the MC 
model except for the U.S. investment equation.
As noted in Section 2.2, when the 2SLS estimator is used, which it is in most 
cases, the predicted values from the first-stage regressions can be interpreted as pre­
dictions of the agents in the economy under the assumption that agents know the 
values of the first-stage regressors at the time they form their expectations. Since 
both it and pet are treated as endogenous in the 2SLS estimation, agents can be as­
sumed to have used the first-stage regressions for it and pet for their predictions. These 
predictions use the information in the predetermined variables in the model. This in­
terpretation is important when considering the use of Pt+[ in one of the measures of 
pet. Agents in effect are assumed to form predictions of Pf+1 by running first-stage 
regressions.

3.3 The Results
The results for the real interest rate specification are in the left half of Table 3.1. A 
low p-value is evidence against the real interest rate hypothesis that a = — ft. With a 
few exceptions, the main one being the US investment equation, the results are not 
supportive of the real interest rate hypothesis. For the U.S. household expenditure 
equations (rows 1^1), 15 of the 16 /?-values are less than .01. For the other quarterly 
countries, 57 of 72 are less than 01 and 64 of 72 are less than .05. For the annual 
countries 20 of 45 are less than .01 and 34 of 45 are less than .05.

66
3 || Interest Rate Effects
The results for the nominal interest rate specification are in the right half of Table 3.1. 
A low p-value is evidence against the nominal interest rate hypothesis that = 0. The 
results are generally supportive of the nominal interest rate hypothesis, again with 
the main exception being the U.S. nonresidential investment equation. For the U.S. 
household expenditure equations only 4 of 16 p-values are less than .01 and only 6 of 
16 are less than .05. For the other quarterly countries 12 of 72 are less than 01 and 23 
of 72 are less than .05. For the annual countries 4 of 45 are less than .01 and 11 of 45 
are less than .05.
Table 3.2 presents the estimates of a and /?. It also presents in the last column the 
estimate of a when pL' is not included (that is, when /3 is constrained to be zero). An 
interesting question is whether most of the estimates of fl are positive. The right half 
of Table 3.1 shows that most estimates are not significant, but if most estimates are 
positive, this would be some evidence in favor of a real interest rate effect (or at least 
of expected inflation having a positive effect on demand).
3. It may be the case, of course, that some more complicated measure of pe leads to the domination 
of the real interest rate specification. The present conclusion is conditional on measures of pe that depend 
either on current and past values of inflation or, in case d, on the one-period-ahead future value of inflation.
Table 3.2 shows that for the U.S. household expenditure equations only 1 of the 
16 estimates of fl is positive. For the other quarterly countries 37 of 72 are positive, 
and for the annual countries 17 of 45 are positive. Of the positive coefficients, 10 have 
/-statistics greater than 2.0, and of the negative coefficients, 25 have /-statistics less 
than —2.0. There is thus more or less an even mix of positive and negative estimates 
of fl except for the United States, where the negative estimates dominate. Many of the 
negative coefficient estimates of are significant, which is completely at odds with the 
real interest rate hypothesis.
Overall, the nominal interest rate specification clearly dominates the real interest rate 
specification. Why this is the case is an interesting question. One possibility is that pet is 
simply a constant, so that the nominal interest rate specification is also the real interest 
rate specification (with the constant absorbed in the constant term of the equation). If, 
for example, agents think the monetary authority is targeting a fixed inflation rate, this 
might be a reason for pet being constant. Whatever the case, the empirical results do not 
favor the use of it — pet in aggregate expenditure equations when pe depends on current 
and recent values of inflation.3 The main exception to this conclusion is US equation 12, 
which explains the capital stock (and thus, through identity 92, nonresidential fixed 
investment) of the firm sector. The real interest rate specification is not rejected for this 
equation. The nominal interest rate specification is rejected at the 95 percent confidence 
level, although not at the 99 percent confidence level.

Testing the NAIRU Model
4.1 Introduction
The price and wage equations in the MC model—equations 10 and 16 in the US model 
and equations 5 and 12 in the ROW model—have quite different dynamic properties 
from those of the NAIRU model, and the purpose of this chapter is to test the NAIRU 
dynamics.1 It will be seen that the NAIRU dynamics are generally rejected.
1. The results for the United States in this chapter are updates of those in Fair (2000). The results for 
the other countries are new.
Section 4.6 presents an alternative way of thinking about the relationship between 
the price level and the unemployment rate, one in which there is a highly nonlinear 
relationship at low values of the unemployment rate. Unfortunately, it is hard to test 
this view because there are so few observations of very low values of the unemploy­
ment rate.
4.2 The NAIRU Model
The NAIRU view of the relationship between inflation and the unemployment rate 
is that there is a value of the unemployment rate (the non-accelerating inflation rate 
of unemployment, or NAIRU) below which the price level forever accelerates and 
above which the price level forever decelerates. The simplest version of the NAIRU 
equation is
7tt - 7Tt_} = fi(ut -u*)  + yst + €t, 
< 0, y > 0, 
(4.1)
where t is the time period, jtt is the rate of inflation, ut is the unemployment rate, st 
is a cost shock variable, €t is an error term, and u*  is the NAIRU. If ut equals u*  for 
all t, the rate of inflation will not change over time aside from the short-run effects of 
st and (assuming st and et have zero means). Otherwise, the rate of inflation will 
67

4 || Testing the NAIRU Model
increase over time (the price level will accelerate) if ut is less than u*  for all t and 
will decrease over time (the price level will decelerate) if ut is greater than u*  for 
all t.
2. “Price level” will be used to describe p even though p is actually the log of the price level.
A more general version of the NAIRU specification is
n 
m 
q 
n
a+ ^817X1-1+^^ut-i + ^YjSt_i+€t, 52 <5/= 1- 
(4-2)
1 = 1 
1=0 
i=0 
i = l
For this specification the NAIRU is —a/ fy. If the unemployment rate is always 
equal to this value, the inflation rate will be constant in the long run aside from the 
short-run effects of st and et.
A key restriction in equation 4.2 is that the 5Z- coefficients sum to one (or in equa­
tion 4.1 that the coefficient of is one). This restriction is used in much of the 
literature. See, for example, the equations in Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry (1996, p. 38), 
Fuhrer (1995, p. 46), Gordon (1997, p. 14), Layard, Nickell, and Jackman (1991, 
p. 379), and Staiger, Stock, and Watson (1997a, p. 35). The specification has even en­
tered the macro textbook literature—see, for example, Mankiw (1994, p. 305). There 
also seems to be considerable support for the NAIRU view in the policy literature. For 
example, Krugman (1996, p. 37), in an article in the New York Times Magazine, writes, 
“The theory of the Nairu has been highly successful in tracking inflation over the last 
20 years. Alan Blinder, the departing vice chairman of the Fed, has described this as 
the ‘clean little secret of macroeconomics.’ ”
An important question is thus whether equations like 4.2 with the summation 
restriction imposed are good approximations of the actual dynamics of the inflation 
process. The basic test that is performed in this chapter is the following. Let pt be the 
log of the price level for period t, and let 7tt be measured as pt — pt_[. Using this 
notation, equations 4.1 and 4.2 can be written in terms of p rather than it. Equation 4.1, 
for example, becomes
Pt = 2pt_x - pt_2 + 
u*)
 + yst + et. 
(4.3)
In other words, equation 4.1 can be written in terms of the current and past two price 
levels,2 with restrictions on the coefficients of the past two price levels. Similarly, if in 
equation 4.2 n is, say, 4, the equation can be written in terms of the current and past five 
price levels, with two restrictions on the coefficients of the five past price levels. (If the 
coefficients on the past five price levels are denoted a} through a5, the two restrictions 
are «4 — 5 — 4a} — 3a2 — 2a3 and a5 — —4 + 3a} + 2a2 + a3.) The main test in this 
chapter is of these two restrictions. The restrictions are easy to test by simply adding 
pt_{ and pt_2 to the NAIRU equation and testing whether they are jointly significant.
An equivalent test is to add 7tt_l (that is, pt_{ — Pj-^ and pt_} to equation 4.2. 
Adding breaks the restriction that the <5Z coefficients sum to one, and adding both 
nt_] and pt_\ breaks the summation restriction and the restriction that each price

level is subtracted from the previous price level before entering the equation. This 
latter restriction can be thought of as a first-derivative restriction, and the summation 
restriction can be thought of as a second-derivative restriction.
Equation 4.2 was used for the tests, where st in the equation is postulated to be 
pmt — Tq — ft, the deviation of pm from a trend line. The variable pm is the log of 
the price of imports, which is taken here to be the cost shock variable. In the empirical 
work for the United States n is taken to be 12 and m and q are taken to be 2. For the 
other quarterly countries n is taken to be 8, with m and q taken to be 2. For the annual 
countries n is taken to be 3, with m and q taken to be 1. This fairly general specification 
regarding the number of lagged values is used to lessen the chances of the results being 
due to a particular choice of lags.
Equation 4.2 was estimated in the following form:
n — 1 
m 
q
Ajtq — A.q -|- Aqf -|- 52

i =0
where a0 = a + (y0 + 
+ y2)r0 + (ko + 2ki + 3k2)Ti and = (y0 + ki + k2)U- The
3. The present specification assumes that the NAIRU is constant, although if the NAIRU had a trend, 
this would be absorbed in the estimate of the coefficient of the time trend in equation 4.4 (and would change 
the interpretation of A. 0. Gordon (1997) has argued that the NAIRU may be time varying.
coefficients a and r0 are not identified in equation 4.4, but for purposes of the tests this 
does not matter. If, however, one wanted to compute the NAIRU (that is, —a/ ^7=1 
one would need a separate estimate of r0 in order to estimate a?
For reference it will be useful to write equation 4.4 with itt_{ and pt_{ added:

4.3 Tests for the United States
X2 Tests
The estimation period for the tests for the United States is 1955:3-2002:3. The results 
of estimating equations 4.4 and 4.5 are presented in Table 4.1. In terms of the variables 
in the US model, p = log PF, u = UR, and pm = log PIM. Regarding the estimation 
technique, the possible endogeneity of ut andpmt is ignored and ordinary least squares 
is used. Ordinary least squares is the standard technique used for estimating NAIRU 
models.
Table 4.1 shows that when jtt_ j and pt_} are added, the standard error of the equation 
falls from 0.00363 to 0.00334. The ^-statistics for the two variables are —5.59 and

are added. The time trend is serving a similar role in equation 4.5 as the constant term is in equation 4.4.

• When pt_x and pt_2 are added in place of and pt_x, the respective coefficient estimates are 
—0.676 and 0.621 with /-statistics of —5.63 and 5.59. All else is the same.

—5.09, respectively, and the %2 value for the hypothesis that the coefficients of both 
variables are zero is 32.20.4
The 5 percent critical %2 value for two degrees of freedom is 5.99 and the 1 percent 
critical value is 9.21. If the /2 distribution is a good approximation to the actual 
distribution of the “/2” values, the two variables are highly significant and thus the 
NAIRU dynamics strongly rejected. If, however, equation 4.4 is in fact the way the 

4.3 || Tests for the United States

price data are generated, the x2 distribution may not be a good approximation for the 
test.5 To check this, the actual distribution was computed using the following procedure.
5. If the x2 distribution is not a good approximation, then the t-distribution will not be either, and so 
standard tests using the t-statistics in Table 4.1 will not be reliable. The following analysis focuses on 
correcting the /2 critical values, and no use of the r-statistics is made.
First, estimate equation 4.4, and record the coefficient estimates and the estimated 
variance of the error term. Call this the “base” equation. Assume that the error term 
is normally distributed with mean zero and variance equal to the estimated variance. 
Then:
1. Draw a value of the error term for each quarter. Add these error terms to the base 
equation and solve it dynamically to generate new data for p. Given the new data 
for p and the data for u and pm (which have not changed), compute the /  value as 
in Table 4.1. Record this value.
2
2. Do step 1 1,000 times, which gives 1,000 /  values. This gives a distribution of 
1,000 values.
2
3. Sort the x  values by size, choose the value above which 5 percent of the values lie 
and the value above which 1 percent of the values lie. These are the 5 percent and 1 
percent critical values, respectively.
2
These calculations were done, and the 5 percent critical value was 19.29 and the 1 
percent critical value was 23.32. These values are considerably larger than the critical 
values from the actual /2 distribution (5.99 and 9.21), but they are still smaller than the 
computed value of 32.20. The two price variables are thus significant at the 99 percent 
confidence level even using the alternative critical values.
The above procedure treats u and pm as exogenous, and it may be that the estimated 
critical values are sensitive to this treatment. To check for this, the following two 
equations were postulated for u and pm\
pmt — a1 + a2t + a3pmt_\ + a^pmt_2 + a3pmt_3 + a§pmt_^ + vt, (4.6)
+ 
+ 
+ fc4M-2 + fc5“-3 + 
+ 
(4.7)
+ b%pmt_2 + b9pmt_3 + bXQpmt_^ + rp.
These two equations along with equation 4.4 were taken to be the “model,” and they 
were estimated by ordinary least squares along with equation 4.4 to get the “base” 
model. The error terms et, vt, and ip were then assumed to be multivariate normal with 
mean zero and covariance matrix equal to the estimated covariance matrix (obtained 
from the estimated residuals). Each trial then consisted of draws of the three error terms 
for each quarter and a dynamic simulation of the model to generate new data for p, pm, 
and u, from which the x2 value was computed. The computed critical values were not 
very sensitive to this treatment of pm and u, and they actually fell slightly. The 5 percent 
value was 15.49, which compares to 19.29 above, and the 1 percent value was 21.43, 
which compares to 23.32 above.

72
4 || Testing the NAIRU Model
The U.S. data thus reject the dynamics implied by the NAIRU specification: 
and pt_x are significant when added to equation 4.4. This rejection may help explain 
two results in the literature. Staiger, Stock, and Watson (1997b), using a standard 
NAIRU specification, estimate variances of NAIRU estimates and find them to be very 
large. This is not surprising if the NAIRU specification is misspecified. Similarly, Eis­
ner (1997) finds the results of estimating NAIRU equations sensitive to various assump­
tions, particularly assumptions about whether the behavior of inflation is symmetric for 
unemployment rates above and below the assumed NAIRU. Again, this sensitivity is 
not surprising if the basic equations used are misspecified.
4.3.1 Recursive RMSE Tests
An alternative way to examine equations 4.4 and 4.5 is to consider how well they 
predict outside sample. To do this, the following root mean squared error (RMSE) 
test was performed. Each equation was first estimated for the period ending in 1969:4 
(all estimation periods begin in 1955:3), and a dynamic eight-quarter-ahead prediction 
was made beginning in 1970:1. The predicted values were recorded. The equation was 
then estimated through 1970:1, and a dynamic eight-quarter-ahead prediction was made 
beginning in 1970:2. This process was repeated through the estimation period ending in 
2002:2. Since observations were available through 2002:3, this procedure generated 131 
one-quarter-ahead predictions, 130 two-quarter-ahead predictions, through 124 eight­
quarter-ahead predictions, where all the predictions are outside sample. RMSEs were 
computed using these predictions and the actual values.
The actual values of u and pm were used for all these predictions, which would 
not have been known at the time of the predictions. The aim here is not to generate 
predictions that could have in principle been made in real time, but to see how good 
the dynamic predictions from each equation are conditional on the actual values of u 
and pm.
The RMSEs are presented in the first two rows of Table 4.2 for the four- and eight­
quarter-ahead predictions for p, tf, and Ayr. If the two rows are compared (equation 4.4 
versus 4.5), it can be seen that the RMSEs for Ayr are similar, but they are much smaller 
for p and n for equation 4.5. The NAIRU restrictions clearly lead to a loss of predictive 
power for the price level and the rate of inflation. It is thus the case that the addition 
of nt_i and pt_{ to the NAIRU equation 4.4 has considerably increased the accuracy 
of the predictions, and so these variables are not only statistically significant but also 
important in a predictive sense.
Equation 4.5 is not the equation that determines the price level in the US model. 
The price level is determined by equation 10, and this equation includes the wage rate 
as an explanatory variable. Equation 10 also includes the unemployment rate, the price 
of imports, the lagged price level, the time trend, and the constant term. The wage 
rate is determined by equation 16, and this equation includes the price level and the 
lagged price level as explanatory variables. Equation 16 also includes the lagged wage 
rate, the time trend, and the constant term. As discussed in Chapter 2, a restriction,

equation 2.23, is imposed on the coefficients in the wage rate equation to ensure that 
the properties of the implied real wage equation are sensible. The two equations are 
estimated by 2SLS.
An interesting question is how accurate equations 10 and 16 are relative to equa­
tion 4.5 in terms of predicting p, n, and Ayr. In terms of the present notation equations 
10 and 16 are:
Pt — 
+ fhPt-\ + fh.wt + &3Pmt + 
+ ^5t +

u>t = To + Yiwt-1 + YiPt + /3A-1 + Y$t + Pa, 
(16)
where
X3 = [A/(1-0(1-y2)-El­
in terms of the notation in the US model w — 1og(W F/LAM). The estimates of 
equations 10 and 16 are in Tables A10 and A16 in Appendix A.
The basic procedure followed for computing the RMSEs for equations 10 and 16 was 
the same as that followed for equation 4.4 and equation 4.5. The beginning estimation 
quarter was 1954.1, and the first end estimation quarter was 1969.4. Each of the 131 sets 
of estimates used the 2SLS technique with the coefficient restriction imposed, where the 
values used for and /32 in the restriction were the estimated values from equation 10. 
The same first-stage regressors were used for these estimates as were used in the basic 
estimation of the equations. The predictions of p and w from equations 10 and 16 were 
generated using the actual values of it and pm, just as was done for equations 4.4 and 4.5.
The RMSEs are presented in the third row in Table 4.2. The results show that the 
RMSEs using equations 10 and 16 are noticeably smaller than those using even equa­
tion 4.5. For the eight-quarter-ahead prediction, for example, the RMSE for pis 2.28 
versus 3.51 for equation 4.5, and the RMSE for 7t is 1.70 versus 2.47 for equation 4.5. 
Even for Ayr the RMSE using equations 10 and 16 is smaller: 1.85 versus 2.10 for

equation 4.5. The structural price and wage equations clearly do better than even the 
price equation with the NAIRU restrictions relaxed.
In the early 1980s there began a movement away from the estimation of structural 
price and wage equations to the estimation of reduced-form price equations like equa­
tion 4.4.6 The current results call this practice into question, given that considerable 
predictive accuracy seems to be lost when it is carried out.

country contains the RMSEs for equation 4.4 and the second row contains the RMSEs 
for equation 4.5. The procedure used to compute the x2 critical values is the same as 
that used for the United States. All critical values were computed using equations 4.6 
and 4.7. For the annual countries the maximum lag length in each equation was 2, not 
4. With three exceptions, a country was included in Table 4.3 if equation 5 for it in 
Table B5 included a demand pressure variable. The three exceptions are CH, CE, and 
ME. The first two were excluded because the basic estimation period was too short, 
and ME was excluded because of poor data in the early part of the estimation period. 
Results for 25 countries are presented in Table 4.3, 12 quarterly countries and 13 annual 
countries.

and 1977:3 for FL The changed beginning years are: 1964 for BE, NO, GR, PO, SP, NZ, and TH; 1973 for 
CO; 1975 for MA; and 1977 for PA.
8. 1989:3 for NE, ST, FI, and KO; 1989 for CO, MA, and PA.
The estimation period for a country was the same as that in Table B5 except when 
the beginning quarter or year had to be increased to account for lags. The exceptions are 
reported in the current footnote.7 For the recursive RMSEs, the first estimation period 
ended in 1979:3 for the quarterly countries and in 1978 for the annual countries with a 
few exceptions. The exceptions are reported in the current footnote.8
The computed critical values in Table 4.3 (denoted x 2J5 and x are considerably 
larger than the x2 critical values of 5.99 for 5 percent and 9.21 for 1 percent. Using the 
X2 critical values, the two added variables are jointly significant (that is, the NAIRU 
restrictions are rejected) at the 5 percent level in all but 1 of the 25 cases and at the 1 
percent level in all but 6 of the 25 cases. On the other hand, using the computed critical 
values the two added variables are jointly significant at the 5 percent level in only 11 of 
the 25 cases and at the 1 percent level in only 6 of the 25 cases. The results thus depend 
importantly on which critical values are used.
The RMSE results, however, are less mixed. Consider the eight-quarter-ahead 
RMSEs for the quarterly countries. For all the countries except CA the RMSEs are 
smaller for p and yr for equation 4.5, the equation without the NAIRU restrictions 
imposed. In many cases they are not only smaller but considerably smaller. In other 
words, in many cases the RMSEs using equation 4.4 are very large: the NAIRU equation 
has poor predictive properties regarding p and yr. This is not true for Ayr, where the 
RMSEs are generally similar for the two equations.
Equation 4.5 also dominates for the annual countries. For the three-year-ahead 
results the RMSEs for equation 4.5 are smaller in 9 of the 13 cases for p and in 10 
of the 13 cases for yr. Again, some of the RMSEs using equation 4.4 are very large. For 
Ayr the RMSEs are generally similar, as is the case for the quarterly countries.
The ROW results thus show that while the x2 tests are not nearly as negative 
regarding the NAIRU equation as are the U.S. results, the RMSE tests are. In general 
the NAIRU equations do not predict well; they have poor dynamic properties in this 
sense.

Properties
This section examines, using the U.S. coefficient estimates, the dynamic properties of 
various equations. No tests are performed; this section is just an analysis of proper­
ties. The question considered is the following: if the unemployment rate were per­
manently lowered by one percentage point, what would the price consequences of 
this be?
To answer this question, the following experiment was performed for each equation. 
A dynamic simulation was run beginning in 2002:4 using the actual values of all the 
variables from 2002:3 back. The values u and of pm from 2002:4 on were taken to 
be the actual value for 2002:3. Call this simulation the “base” simulation. A second 
dynamic simulation was then run where the only change was that the unemployment 
rate was decreased permanently by one percentage point from 2002:4 on. The difference 
between the predicted value of p from this simulation and that from the base simulation 
for a given quarter is the estimated effect of the change in u on p?
The results for four equations are presented in Table 4.4. The equations are (1) equa­
tion 4.4, (2) equation 4.4 with added, (3) equation 4.5, which is equation 4.4 with 
both and pt_x added, and (4) equations 10 and 16 together. When equation 4.4 
is estimated with tt?_] added, the summation (second-derivative) restriction is broken 
but the first-derivative restriction is not. For this estimated equation the <5Z- coefficients 
summed to 0.836.9 10
9. Because the equations are linear, it does not matter what values are used for pm as long as the same 
values are used for both simulations. Similarly, it does not matter what values are used for u as long as each 
value for the second simulation is one percentage point higher than the corresponding value for the base 
simulation.
10. When jrt_l is added to equation 4.4, the x2 value is 5.46 with computed 5 and 1 percent critical 
values of 9.14 and 14.58, respectively. jrf_l is thus not significant at even the 5 percent level when added 
to equation 4.4 even though the sum of .836 seems substantially less than one. (When pf_t is added to the 
equation with 7rf_] already added, the x2 value is 25.93 with computed 5 and 1 percent critical values of 
13.31 and 18.20, respectively. The variable pt_{ is thus highly significant when added to the equation with 
7rf_l already added.) Recursive RMSE results as in Table 4.2 were also obtained for the equation with only 
jrt_l added. The six RMSEs corresponding to those in Table 4.2 are 1.93, 4.09, 2.53, 2.87, 2.09, and 2.09. 
These values are in between those for equation 4.4 and equation 4.5.
Before discussing results, I should stress that these experiments are not meant to 
be realistic. For example, it is unlikely that the Fed would allow a permanent fall in u 
to take place as p rose. The experiments are simply meant to help illustrate how the 
equations differ in a particular dimension.
Consider the very long run properties in Table 4.4 first. For equation 4.4, the new 
price level grows without bounds relative to the base price level and the new inflation 
rate grows without bounds relative to the base inflation rate. For equation 4.4 with _ ] 
added, the new price level grows without bounds relative to the base, but the inflation 
rate does not. It is 1.89 percentage points higher in the long run. For equation 4.5 (which 
again is equation 4.4 with both nt_[ and pt_\ added), the new price level is higher by 
2.98 percent in the limit and the new inflation rate is back to the base. For equations 10

and 16, the new price level is higher by 2.11 percent in the limit and the new inflation 
rate is back to the base.
The long-run properties are thus vastly different, as is, of course, obvious from 
the specifications. What is interesting, however, is that the effects are fairly close for 
the first few quarters. One would be hard pressed to choose among the equations on 
the basis of which short-run implications (say the results out to eight quarters) seem 
more “reasonable.” Instead, tests like the ones in this chapter are needed to try to 
choose.
4.6 
Nonlinearities
If the NAIRU specification is rejected, this changes the way one thinks about the rela­
tionship between inflation and unemployment. One should not think that there is some 
unemployment rate below which the price level forever accelerates and above which it 
forever decelerates. It is not the case, however, that equation 4.5 (or equations 10 and 
16) is a sensible alternative regarding long-run properties. Equation 4.5 implies that 
a lowering of the unemployment rate has only a modest long-run effect on the price 
level regardless of how low the initial value of the unemployment rate is. For exam­

pie, the results in Table 4.4 for equation 4.5 are independent of the initial value of the 
unemployment rate.
A key weakness of equation 4.5 is (in my view) the linearity assumption regarding 
the effects of u on p. It seems likely that there is a nonlinear relationship between 
the price level and the unemployment rate at low levels of the unemployment rate. 
One possible specification, for example, would be to replace u in equation 4.5 with 
\/(u — .02). In this case as u approaches .02, the estimated effects on p become larger 
and larger. I have experimented with a variety of functional forms like this in estimating 
price equations like equation 10 in the US model and equations 5 in the ROW model 
to see if the data can pick up a nonlinear relationship. Unfortunately, there are so few 
observations of very low unemployment rates that the data do not appear capable of 
discriminating among functional forms. A variety of functional forms, including the 
linear form, lead to very similar results. In the end I simply chose the linear form for 
lack of a better alternative for both the US equation 10 and the ROW equations 5. 
This does not mean, however, that the true functional form is linear, only that the data 
are insufficient for estimating the true functional form. It does mean, however, that 
one should not run experiments using the MC model in which unemployment rates or 
output gaps are driven to historically low levels. The price equations are unlikely to be 
reliable in these cases.
The argument here about the relationship between inflation and the unemployment 
rate can thus be summarized by the following two points. First, the NAIRU dynamics, 
namely the first- and second-derivative restrictions, are not accurate. Second, the 
relationship between the price level and the unemployment rate is nonlinear at low 
values of the unemployment rate. The results in this chapter generally support the first 
point, but they have nothing to say about the second point.
Conditional on this argument, the main message for policymakers is that they should 
not think there is some value of the unemployment rate below which the price level 
accelerates and above which it decelerates. They should think instead that the price level 
is a negative function of the unemployment rate (or other measure of demand slack), 
where at some point the function begins to become nonlinear. How bold a policymaker 
is in pushing the unemployment rate into uncharted waters will depend on how fast he 
or she thinks the nonlinearity becomes severe.

U.S. Wealth Effects
5.1 
Introduction
The results in this chapter are important for understanding the results in the next chapter. 
The purpose of this chapter is to give a general idea of the size of the wealth effect in 
the US model. When stock prices change, this changes the wealth of the household 
sector, which is turn affects household consumption expenditures. The experiment 
in section 5.3 shows the size of this effect. The effect of a sustained increase in 
wealth on consumption expenditures is estimated to be about 3 percent per year, 
ignoring feedback effects. The variables that are referenced in this chapter are listed 
in Table 5.1.
5.2 
The Effects of CG
The variable AH in the US model is the nominal value of net financial assets of the 
household sector. It is determined by the identity 66 in Table A.3:
AH = AH_ i+SH - XMH + CG - DISH, 
(66)
where SH is the financial saving of the household sector, MH is its holdings of demand 
deposits and currency, CG is the value of capital gains (+) or losses (—) on the financial 
assets held by the household sector (almost all of which is the change in the market 
value corporate stocks held by the household sector), and DISH is a discrepancy 
term.
A change in the stock market affects AH through CG. The variable CG is constructed 
from data from the U.S. Flow of Funds accounts. It is highly correlated with the 
change in the S&P 500 stock price index. When CG/(PX_1KS'_1) is regressed on 
(SP — SP-^/^PX-^YS-^, where SP is the value of the S&P 500 index at the end

7?2 = .841, 1954.1-2002.3.
PX_1KS'_1 is used for scale purposes in this regression to lessen the chances of 
heteroskedasticity. The fit of this equation is very good, reflecting the high correla­
tion of CG and the change in the S&P 500 index. A coefficient of 9.88 means that a 
100-point change in the S&P 500 index results in a $988 billion dollar change in the 
value of stocks held by the household sector.

CG is determined by equation 25, which is repeated here:

PX^YS^ (2.42)

(0.52) PX^YS^
7?2 = .026, 1954.1 - 2002.3.
It is clear that equation 25 and equation 5.2 are telling the same story. The change in 
the bond rate (ARB) has a negative effect on the change in stock prices and the change 
in profits (An) has a positive effect. The profit effect is not statistically significant, 
whereas the bond rate effect is or is close to being significant. There is thus at least 
some link from interest rates to stock prices estimated in the model.
Equation 66 above shows that when CG changes, AH changes. The wealth vari­
able in the household expenditure equations is AA, which is determined by iden­
tity 89:
AA = (AH + MH)/PH + (P1H ■ KH)/PH, 
(89)
where PH is a price deflator for the household sector. AA appears as an explanatory 
variable in stochastic equations 1, 2, and 3, and these are repeated in Table 5.2. 
AA has positive effects on the three consumption expenditure variables. The wealth 
variable, log(AA/POF’)_| or (AA/POP)_1, has ^-statistics of 3.50, 4.78, and 1.53, 
respectively.
5.3 
Changing AA by 1,000
How much do consumer expenditures change when AA changes? The size of this wealth 
effect depends on what is held constant. If the complete MC model is used, then an 
increase in AA increases U.S. household consumption expenditures, which then leads to 
a multiplier effect on output and at least some increase in inflation. Given the estimated 
interest rate rule in the model, the Fed responds to the expansion by raising interest 
rates, which slows down the expansion, and so on. The rest of the world also responds 
to what the United States is doing, which then feeds back on the United States. The 
size of the wealth effect with nothing held constant thus depends on many features of 
the MC model, not just the properties of the U.S. household consumption expenditure 
equations.
One can focus solely on the properties of the household consumption expenditure 
equations by taking income and interest rates to be exogenous. The following experi-

ment was performed. The variables YD/(POP • PH), RSA, RMA, and AA were taken to 
be exogenous, which isolates equations 1, 2, and 3 from the rest of the model. The esti­
mated residuals were then added to the stochastic equations and taken to be exogenous. 
This means that when the model is solved using the actual values of all the exogenous 
variables, a perfect tracking solution is obtained. The actual values are thus the base 
values. AA was then increased by $1,000 billion from the base case, and the model 
was solved for the 1995:1-2002:3 period. The difference for a given quarter between 
the predicted value of a variable and the actual value is the estimated effect of the AA 
change on that variable for that quarter.
The effects on total consumption expenditures (CS + CN + CD) by quarters are 
presented in Table 5.3. After four quarters, expenditures have risen $18.6 billion, and 
after eight quarters they have risen $27.7 billion. The increases then level off at slightly 
less than $30 billion. The effect of a sustained increase in wealth on consumption 
expenditures is thus estimated to be slightly less than 3 percent per year, ignoring any 
feedback effects.
This roughly 3 percent estimate is consistent with results from other approaches. 
A recent study estimating the size of the wealth effect is discussed in Ludvigson and 
Steindel (1999). They conclude (p. 30) that “a dollar increase in wealth likely leads to 
a three- to four-cent increase in consumption in today’s economy,” although they argue

that there is considerable uncertainty regarding this estimate. Their approach is simpler 
and less structural than the present one, but the size of their estimate is similar. Starr- 
McCluer (1998) uses survey data to examine the wealth effect, and she concludes that 
her results are broadly consistent with a modest wealth effect.

Testing for a New Economy 
in the 1990s
6.1 
Introduction
There was much talk in the United States in the last half of the 1990s about the existence 
of a new economy or a “new age.”1 Was this talk just media hype or were there in 
fact large structural changes in the 1990s? One change that seems obvious is the huge 
increase in stock prices relative to earnings beginning in 1995. This can be seen in 
Figure 6.1, where the price-earnings (PE) ratio for the S&P 500 index is plotted. The 
increase in the PE ratio beginning in 1995 is quite large. The mean of the PE ratio is 
14.0 for the 1948.1-1994.4 period and 27.0 for the 1995.1-2002.3 period. This increase 
appears to be a major structural change, and an important question is whether there were 
other such changes.
1. The results in this chapter are the same as those in Fair (2004a).
The end-of-sample stability test of Andrews (2003) was used in Chapter 2 to test 
the 30 stochastic equations of the US model for structural change beginning in 1995. 
The hypothesis of stability was rejected for only three equations, the main equation 
being equation 25, explaining CG. The rejection for the CG equation is, of course, 
not surprising given Figure 6.1. It may be surprising, however, that there were no 
other major rejections, since a number of macroeconomic variables have large changes 
beginning about 1995. Four such variables are plotted in Figures 6.2-6.5. They are 
(1) the personal saving rate (lower after 1995), (2) the U.S. current account as a fraction 
of GDP (lower after 1995), (3) the ratio of nonresidential fixed investment to output 
(higher after 1995), and (4) the federal government budget surplus as a percentage 
of GDP (higher after 1995). The results reported in this chapter suggest that all four 
of these unusual changes are because of the stock market boom and not because of 
structural changes in the stochastic equations
The fact that the stability hypothesis is not rejected for the three U.S. consumption 
equations means that conditional on wealth the behavior of consumption does not seem 
unusual. The wealth effect on consumption also explains the low U.S. current account

because some of any increased consumption is increased consumption of imports. 
Similarly, conditional on the low cost of capital caused by the stock market boom, 
the behavior of investment does not seem unusual according to the stability test of 
the investment equation. Finally, the rise in the federal government budget surplus is 
explained by the robust economy fueled by consumption and investment spending.
To examine the effects of the stock market boom, a counterfactual experiment is 
performed in this chapter using the MC model. The experiment is one in which the 
stock market boom is eliminated. The results show (in section 6.3) that had there been 
no stock market boom, the behavior of the four variables in Figures 6.2-6.5 would not 
have been unusual.
The overall story is thus quite simple: the only main structural change in the last half 
of the 1990s was the stock market boom. All other unusual changes can be explained 
by it. What is not simple, however, is finding a reason for the stock market boom in the 
first place. The possibility that the degree of risk aversion of the average investor fell 
in the last half of the 1990s is tested in Fair (2003c), using data on companies that have 
been in the S&P 500 index since 1957. The evidence suggests that risk aversion has 
not fallen: there is no evidence that more risky companies have had larger increases in 
their price-earnings ratios since 1995 than less risky companies.
If earnings growth had been unusually high in the last half of the 1990s, this might 
have led investors to expect unusually high growth in the future, which would have 
driven up stock prices relative to current earnings. Figures 6.6 and 6.7, however, show 
that there was nothing unusual about earnings in the last half of the 1990s. Figure 6.6

plots the four-quarter growth rate of S&P 500 earnings, and Figure 6.7 plots the ratio 
of NIPA after-tax profits to GDP.
Much of the new economy talk has been about productivity growth, which sec­
tion 6.4 examines. It will be seen that using 1995 as the base year to measure produc­
tivity growth, which is commonly done, is misleading because 1995 is a cyclically low 
productivity year. If 1992 is used instead, the growth rate in the last half of the 1990s 
for the total economy less general government is only slightly higher than earlier (from 
1.49 percent to 1.82 percent per year). There is thus nothing in the productivity data that 
would suggest a huge increase in stock prices relative to earnings. The huge increase in 
PE ratios beginning in 1995 thus appears to be a puzzle. This chapter is not an attempt 
to explain this puzzle. Rather, it shows that conditional on the stock market boom, the 
rest of the economy does not seem unusual.
6.2 
End-of-Sample Stability Tests
For the end-of-sample stability tests in Chapter 2 the sample period was 1954:1-2002:3, 
with the potential break at 1995:1. For this chapter, tests have also been performed for 
the sample period 1954:1-2000:4, with again the potential break at 1995:1. In other 
words, the second test does not include what happened in 2001 and 2002.
The p-values for the 30 equations are presented in Table 6.1.2 The results for the 
period ending in 2000:4 are very similar to the other results. There are still only three 
equations for which the hypothesis of stability was rejected—the interest payments 
equation 19, the demand for currency equation 26, and the CG equation 25. Overall, 
the results in Table 6.1 are strongly supportive of the view that there were no major 
structural changes beginning in 1995:1 except for the stock market boom. The next 
section estimates what the economy would have been like had there been no stock

No Stock Market Boom: Counterfactual
For the 10-year period prior to 1995 (1985:1-1994:4) the sum of the quarterly values 
of CG, which is the total capital gain on household financial assets for this period, was 
$5,248 trillion. This is an average of $131.2 billion per quarter. The sum for the next 5 
years (1995:1-1999:4) was $13,560 trillion, an average of $678.0 billion per quarter. 
During the next 11 quarters (2000:1-2002:3) the sum was —$7,040 trillion, an average 
of —$640.0 billion per quarter. The total capital gain over the entire 1995:1-2002:3 
period was thus $6,520 trillion, an average of $210.3 billion per quarter.
The counterfactual experiment assumes that the capital gain for each quarter of the 
1995:1-2002:3 period was $131.2 billion, which is the average for the prior 10-year 
period. This gives a total capital gain of $4,067 trillion, which is about $2.5 trillion less

than the actual value of $6,520 trillion. The timing, of course, is quite different from 
what actually happened, since the experiment does not have the huge boom up to 2000 
and then the large correction after that.
The entire MC model is used for the experiment, which is for the 1995:1-2002:3 
period. The estimated residuals are first added to all the stochastic equations, includ­
ing the trade share equations, and then taken to be exogenous. This means that when

the model is solved using the actual values of all the exogenous variables, a perfect 
tracking solution is obtained. The actual values are thus the base values. Equation 
25 is then dropped from the model, and the value of CG in each quarter is taken 
to be $131.2 billion. The model is then solved. The difference between the solution 
value and the actual value for each endogenous variable for each quarter is the ef­
fect of the CG change. The solution values will be called values in the “no boom” 
case.3
3. At the time this experiment was performed, all the data for the United States were available through 
2002:3, but not for the other countries. When necessary, extrapolated values of the exogenous variables for 
the other countries were used. This has little effect on the final results because the same values are used for 
both the base case and the no boom case.
Figures 6.8-6.15 plot some of the results. Each figure presents the actual values of 
the variable and the solution values. Figure 6.8 shows that the personal saving rate is 
considerably higher in the no boom case. No longer are the values outside the range 
of historical experience in 1999 and 2000. This is the wealth effect on consumption at 
work. With no stock market boom, households are predicted to consume less. Figure 6.9 
shows that the current account deficit through 2000 is not as bad in the no boom case: 
imports are lower because of the lower consumption. Figure 6.10 shows that there is a 
much smaller rise in the investment-output ratio in the no boom case. Investment is not 
as high because the cost of capital is not as low and because output is lower. Figure 6.11

6.3 || No Stock Market Boom: Counterfactual
93
Figure 6.9
Ratio of U.S. Current Account to GDP, 1995:1-2002:3
shows that the federal government budget is not as good, which is due to the less robust 
economy.
Figure 6.12 plots the percentage change in real GDP, and Figure 6.13 plots the 
unemployment rate. Both show, not surprisingly, that the real side of the economy is 
worse in the no boom case, especially through 2000. In the fourth quarter of 1999, for 
example, the unemployment rate in the no boom case is 5.5 percent, which compares 
to the actual value of 4.1 percent. Figure 6.14 plots the percentage change in the private 
nonfarm price deflator, PF. It shows that the rate of inflation is lower in the no boom 
case (because of the higher unemployment rate), although in neither case would one 
consider inflation to be a problem.
Figure 6.15 plots the three-month Treasury bill rate, RS, which is the rate determined 
by equation 30, the estimated interest rate rule of the Fed. The figure shows that the bill 
rate is lower in the no boom case. The Fed is predicted to respond to the more sluggish 
economy by lowering rates. In the fourth quarter of 1999, the bill rate is 3.3 percent in 
the no boom case, which compares to the actual value of 5.0 percent. It is interesting to 
note that this amount of easing of the Fed is not enough to prevent the unemployment 
rate from rising, as was seen in Figure 6.13. Note from Figure 6.12, however, that by 
the end of 2000 the growth rate is higher in the no boom case. This is partly due to the 
lower interest rates in the no boom case.
It is thus clear from the figures in this section that according to the MC model, the 
U.S. economic boom in the last half of the 1990s was fueled by the wealth effect and 
cost-of-capital effect from the stock market boom. Had it not been for the stock market 
boom, the economy would have looked more or less normal.

6.4 Aggregate Productivity
As noted in the introduction, much of the new economy talk has been about productivity 
growth. For the above experiment long-run productivity growth is exogenous: the MC 
model does not explain long-run productivity growth. This issue will now be addressed.
Figure 6.16a plots the log of output per worker hour for the total economy less 
general government for 1948:1-2002:3. Also plotted in the figure is a peak-to-peak 
interpolation line, with peaks in 1950:3, 1966:1, 1973:1, 1992:4, and 2002:3.4 The an­
nual growth rates between the peaks are 3.27, 2.72, 1.49, and 1.82 percent, respectively. 
Figure 6.16b is an enlarged version of Figure 6.16a for the period from 1985:1 on.
4. Although the data for the US model begin in 1952:1, the data used in this section go back to 1948:1. 
The same peaks in Figure 16.6a are used to construct LAM in the US model except that 1955:2 is used 
instead of 1950:3. See LAM in Table A.7.
An interesting feature of Figure 6.16a is the modest increase in the peak-to-peak 
productivity growth rate after 1992:4: from 1.49 to 1.82 percent. This difference of 
0.33 percentage points is certainly not large enough to classify as a movement into a 
new age.
It can be seen in Figure 6.16b why some were so optimistic about productivity 
growth in the last half of the 1990s. Between 1995:3 and 2000:2 productivity grew 
at an annual rate of 2.49 percent, which is a noticeable improvement from the 1.49 
percent rate between 1973:1 and 1992:4. What this overlooks, however, is that produc­
tivity grew at an annual rate of only 0.27 percent between 1992:4 and 1995:3, so 1995 
is a low year to use as a base. Under the assumption that the interpolation line mea­
sures cyclically adjusted productivity, the 2.49 percent growth rate between 1995:3 
and 2000:2 is composed of 1.82 percent long-run growth and 0.67 percent cyclical 
growth.
Productivity data are also available for the nonfarm business sector, and it is of 
interest to see if the above productivity growth estimates are sensitive to the level 
of aggregation. In 2001 real GDP less general government output accounted for 89.4 
percent real GDP and nonfarm business output accounted for 83.8 percent. (Nonfarm 
business output excludes output from farms, households, and nonprofit institutions 
in addition to output from general government.) Figures 6.17a and 6.17b are for the 
nonfarm business sector.
There is only a modest change in moving from Figures 6.16a and 6.16b to Fig­
ures 6.17a and 6.17b. The increase in long-run productivity growth beginning in 1992:4 
is now 0.50 percentage points (from 1.43 percent to 1.93 percent) rather than 0.33 (from 
1.49 percent to 1.82 percent). The actual growth rate from 1992:4to 1995:3 is now0.39 
percent rather than 0.27 percent, and the actual growth rate from 1995:3 to 2000:2 is 
now 2.50 percent rather than 2.49 percent. Again, under the assumption that the inter­
polation line measures cyclically adjusted productivity, the 2.50 percent growth rate 
between 1995:3 and 2000:2 is composed of 1.93 percent long-run growth and 0.57 
percent cyclical growth for the nonfarm business sector.

6 || Testing for a New Economy in the 1990s
Regarding other studies of productivity growth in the 1990s, Blinder and Yellen 
(2001) test for a break in productivity growth beginning in 1995:4, and they find a 
significant break once their regression equation is estimated through 1998:3. From 
Figures 6.16b and 6.17b this is not surprising, given the rapid productivity growth 
between 1995:4 and 1998:3. Again, however, 1995:4 is a misleading base to use. Oliner 
and Sichel (2000) compare productivity growth in 1990-1995 to that in 1996-1999 and 
do not adjust for cyclical growth. This is also true in Nordhaus (2000), who compares 
productivity growth in 1990-1995 to that in 1996-1998.
Gordon (2000a, b) argues that some of the actual productivity growth after 1995 
is cyclical. He estimates in Gordon (2000b, p. 219) that of the actual 2.82 percent 
productivity growth in the nonfarm business sector between 1995:4 and 1999:4, 0.54 is 
cyclical and 2.28 is long-run. This estimate of 0.54, which is backed out of a regression, 
is remarkably close to the 0.57 figure estimated above for the 1995:3-2000:2 period 
using the interpolation line in Figure 6.17b. Gordon’s actual number of 2.82 percent 
is larger than the actual number of 2.50 percent in Figure 6.17b. This difference is 
primarily due to the fact that Figure 6.17b uses revised data. The data revisions that 
occurred after Gordon’s work had the effect of lowering the estimates of productivity 
growth.
Gordon’s results and the results from Figure 6.17b are thus supportive of each 
other. Although Gordon estimates long-run productivity growth to be 2.28 percent, 
Figure 6.17b suggests that this number is less than 2 percent on the basis of the revised 
data. The message of Figures 6.16b and 6.17b is thus that productivity growth has 
increased in the last half of the 1990s, but only by about 0.4 to 0.5 percentage points.
6.5 Conclusion
The results in this chapter are consistent with the simple story that the only major struc­
tural change in the last half of the 1990s was the huge increase in stock prices relative 
to earnings. The only major U.S. macroeconometric equation in the MC model for 
which the hypothesis of end-of-sample stability is rejected is the stock price equation. 
The counterfactual experiment using the MC model in which the stock market boom is 
turned off shows that were it not for the boom the behavior of variables like the saving 
rate, the U.S. current account, the investment-output ratio, and the federal government 
budget would not have been historically unusual. Nor do the data on aggregate produc­
tivity show a large increase in trend productivity growth in the last half of the 1990s: 
there is no evidence in the data of a new age of productivity growth.
None of the results here provide any hint as to why the stock market began to boom 
in 1995. In fact, they deepen the puzzle, since there appear to be no major structural 
changes in the economy (except the stock market) and there is no evidence of a new age 
of productivity growth. In addition, Figures 16.6 and 16.7 show no unusual behavior 
of earnings in the last half of the 1990s, and the results in Fair (2003c) suggest that the 
risk aversion of the average investor has not decreased. In short, there is no obvious 
fundamental reason for the stock market boom.

A “Modern” View of Macroeconomics
7.1 
Introduction
Although macroeconomics has been in a state of flux at least since Lucas’s (1976) cri­
tique, there has recently emerged a view that some see as a convergence.1 Taylor (2000, 
p. 90), for example, states:
1. The results in this chapter are updates of those in Fair (2002).
2. In empirical work the lagged interest rate is often included as an explanatory variable in the interest 
rate rule. This picks up possible smoothing of the interest rate by the Fed.
At the practical level, a common view of macroeconomics is now pervasive in policy­
research projects at universities and central banks around the world. This view evolved 
gradually since the rational-expectations revolution of the 1970’s and has solidified dur­
ing the 1990’s. It differs from past views, and it explains the growth and fluctuations 
of the modern economy; it can thus be said to represent a modern view of macroeco­
nomics.
This view is nicely summarized in Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (1999), and it is used 
in Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2000) to examine monetary policy rules. Taylor (2000, 
p. 91) points out that virtually all the papers in Taylor (1999a) use this view and that the 
view is widely used for policy evaluation in many central banks. In both the backward­
looking model and the forward-looking model in Svensson (2003) aggregate demand 
depends negatively on the real interest rate, as in the aggregate demand equation below. 
Romer (2000) proposes a way of teaching this modern view at the introductory level.
This view is based on three equations:
1. Interest rate rule. The Fed adjusts the nominal interest rate in response to inflation 
and the output gap (deviation of output from potential).  The nominal interest rate 
responds positively to inflation and the output gap. The coefficient on inflation is 
greater than one, and so the real interest rate rises when inflation rises.
12
101

102
7 || A “Modern” View of Macroeconomics
2. Price equation. Inflation depends on the output gap, cost shocks, and expected 
future inflation.
3. Aggregate demand equation. Aggregate demand (real) depends on the real interest 
rate, expected future demand, and exogenous shocks. The real interest rate effect is 
negative.
This basic model is, of course, a highly simplified view of the way the macroeconomy 
works, as everyone would admit. Many details have been left out. If, however, the model 
captures the broad features of the economy in a fairly accurate way, the lack of detail 
is not likely to be serious for many purposes; the details can be filled in when needed. 
The “modern” view of macroeconomics is that the broad features of the economy have 
been adequately captured by this model.
Regarding the effects of an inflation shock in the modern-view model, the aggre­
gate demand equation implies that an increase in inflation with the nominal interest 
rate held constant is expansionary (because the real interest rate falls). The model is 
in fact not stable in this case because an increase in output increases inflation through 
the price equation, which further increases output through the aggregate demand equa­
tion, and so on. In order for the model to be stable, the nominal interest rate must 
rise more than inflation, which means that the coefficient on inflation in the interest 
rate rule must be greater than one. Because of this feature, some have criticized Fed 
behavior in the 1960s and 1970s as in effect following a rule with a coefficient on 
inflation less than one—see, for example, Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (1999) and Tay­
lor (1999c).
It will be seen in the next section that in the MC model a positive inflation shock with 
the nominal interest rate held constant is contractionary, not expansionary as implied 
by the modern-view model. There are three main reasons for this difference. First, 
except for the US investment equation 12, nominal interest rates rather than real interest 
rates are used in the consumption and investment equations. The results in Chapter 3 
strongly support the use of nominal over real interest rates. Second, in the MC model 
the percentage increase in nominal household wealth from a positive inflation shock 
is less than the percentage increase in the price level, and so there is a fall in real 
household wealth from a positive inflation shock. This has, other things being equal, a 
negative effect on real household expenditures. Third, in the MC model nominal wages 
lag prices, and so a positive inflation shock results in an initial fall in real wage rates 
and thus in real labor income. A fall in real labor income has, other things being equal, 
a negative effect on real household expenditures.
If these three features are true, they imply that a positive inflation shock has a 
negative effect on aggregate demand even if the nominal interest rate is held constant. 
The fall in real wealth and real labor income is contractionary, and there is no offsetting 
rise in demand from the fall in the real interest rate. Not only does the Fed not have 
to increase the nominal interest rate more than the increase in inflation for there to be 
a contraction, it does not have to increase the nominal rate at all! The inflation shock 
itself will contract the economy through the real wealth and real income effects.

7.2 || Estimated Effects of a Positive Inflation Shock
103
The omission of wages from the modern-view model can be traced back to the late 
1970s, where, as discussed in Chapter 4 (see note 5), there began a movement away from 
the estimation of structural price and wage equations to the estimation of reduced-form 
price equations (that is, price equations that do not include wage rates as explanatory 
variables). This line of research evolved to the estimation of NAIRU equations, which 
represent the modern view.
7.2 
Estimated Effects of a Positive Inflation Shock
A simple experiment is performed in this section that shows that in the MC model 
a positive inflation shock is contractionary. The period used is 1994:1-1998:4, 20 
quarters. The first step, as for the experiment in section 6.3, is to add the estimated 
residuals to the stochastic equations and take them to be exogenous. Again, this means 
that when the model is solved using the actual values of all the exogenous variables, 
a perfect tracking solution results. The base path for the experiment is thus just the 
historical path. Then the constant term in the US price equation 10 is increased by 0.005 
(0.50 percentage points) from its estimated value.3 The estimated interest rate rule for 
the Fed, equation 30, is dropped, and the nominal short-term interest rate, RS, is also 
taken to be exogenous for the United States. The model is then solved. The difference 
between the predicted value of each variable and each period from this solution and 
its base (actual) value is the estimated effect of the price-equation shock. Remember 
that this is an experiment in which there is no change in the U.S. short-term nominal 
interest rate because the US interest rate rule is dropped. There is also no effect on U.S. 
long-term nominal interest rates because they depend only on current and past U.S. 
short-term nominal interest rates.
3. Note that this is a shock to the price equation, not to the wage equation. It is similar to an increase in 
the price of oil. In the MC model an increase in the price of oil (which is exogenous) increases the U.S. price 
of imports, which is an explanatory variable in the US price equation. Either an increase in the constant 
term in the price equation or an increase in the price of oil leads to an initial fall in the real wage, because 
wages lag prices. If the shock were instead to the wage equation, there would be an initial rise in the real 
wage, which would have much different effects.
Selected results from this experiment are presented in Table 7.1. The main point 
for present purposes is in row 1, which shows that real GDP falls: the inflation 
shock is contractionary. The rest of this section is simply a discussion of some of the 
details.
Row 2 shows the effects of the change in the constant term in the price equation 
on the price level. The price level is 0.52 percent higher than its base value in the first 
quarter, 1.00 percent higher in the second quarter, and so on through the twentieth 
quarter, where it is 4.68 percent higher. (The shock to the price equation accumulates 
over time because of the lagged dependent variable in the equation.) Row 3 versus row 
2 shows that the nominal wage rate rises less than the price level, and so there is a fall in 
the real wage rate, WF/PF. Row 4 shows that real disposable income falls. (Although

not shown, nominal disposable income increases.) Real disposable income falls because 
of the fall in the real wage rate and because some nonlabor nominal income, such as 
interest income, rises less in percentage terms than the price level.
The change in nominal corporate after-tax profits is higher (row 5), and this in 
turn leads to a small increase in capital gains (CG) for the household sector (row 6). 
(This is US equation 25 at work.) For example, the increase in capital gains in the 
first quarter is $10.5 billion. (CG is not affected by any nominal interest rate changes 
because there are none.) The increase in CG leads to an increase in nominal household 
wealth (not shown), but row 7 shows that real household wealth is lower. This means 
that the percentage increase in nominal household wealth is smaller than the percentage 
increase in the price level. Put another way, US equation 25 does not lead to a large 
enough increase in CG to have real household wealth rise.
The fall in real income and real wealth leads to a fall in the four categories of 
household expenditures (rows 8-11). Nonresidential fixed investment is lower (row 12), 
which is a response to the lower values of output, although this is partly offset by the 
fall in the real interest rate. (Remember that US equation 12 is the one demand equation 
in the model that uses the real interest rate.)
Rows 13 and 14 present the Japanese and German nominal exchange rates relative 
to the U.S. dollar. (An increase in a rate is a depreciation of the currency.) The two 
currencies appreciate relative to the dollar. This is because the U.S. price level rises 
relative to the Japanese and German price levels, which leads, other things being equal, 
to an appreciation of the yen and DM through the estimated equations for the two 
exchange rates (see Table B9 in Appendix B).
Row 15 shows that the U.S. import price level rises, which is due to the depreciation 
of the dollar, and row 16 shows that the U.S. export price level rises, which is due to 
the increase in the overall U.S. price level.
The real value of imports in the model responds positively to a decrease in the 
import price level relative to the domestic price level and negatively to a decrease in real 
income. Row 17 shows that the real income effect dominates. The negative effect from 
the fall in real income dominates the positive effect from the fall in the price of imports 
relative to the domestic price level. The real value of U.S. exports is lower (row 18), 
which is due to a higher relative U.S. export price level. (The export price level increases 
more than the dollar depreciates, and so U.S. export prices in other countries’ currencies 
increase.) Even though the real value of U.S. exports is lower, there is an improvement 
in the nominal U.S. current account (row 19). This improvement is initially due to the 
higher U.S. export price level (a J-curve type of effect) and later to the fact that the real 
value of U.S. imports falls more than does the real value of U.S. exports. In other words, 
the contractionary U.S. economy helps improve the U.S. current account because of the 
fall in imports.
Regarding long-run effects, the present experiment is somewhat artificial because 
of the dropping of the estimated interest rate rule of the Fed. The rule has the property 
that, other things being equal, the Fed will lower the nominal interest rate when the 
U.S. economy contracts. This will then help bring the economy out of the contraction.

106
7 || A “Modern” View of Macroeconomics
The present experiment is merely meant to show what would be the case if the rule 
were dropped. In practice, of course, the Fed would react.
It is interesting to note that the result obtained here from analyzing the MC model— 
that an increase in inflation is contractionary even when the nominal interest rate is held 
constant—is also reached in Giordani (2003) from analyzing VAR models. The results 
from these two quite different approaches both cast doubt on a key property of modern­
view models.
7.3 The FRB/US Model
The FRB/US model—Federal Reserve Board (2000)—is sometimes cited as a macroe­
conometric model that is consistent with the modern view (see, for example, Tay­
lor 2000, p. 91). This model has strong real interest rate effects. In fact, if government 
spending is increased in the FRB/US model with the nominal interest rate held con­
stant, real output eventually expands so much that the model will no longer solve.4 The 
increase in government spending raises inflation, which with nominal interest rates held 
constant lowers real interest rates, which leads to an unlimited expansion. The model 
is not stable unless there is a nominal interest rate rule that leads to an increase in the 
real interest rate when inflation increases.
4. Personal correspondence with Andrew Levin and David Reifschneider.
It may seem puzzling that two macroeconometric models could have such different 
properties. Given the empirical results in Chapter 3, how can it be that the FRB/US 
model finds such strong real interest rate effects? The answer is that many restrictions 
have been imposed on the model that have the effect of imposing large real interest 
rate effects. In most of the expenditure equations real interest rate effects are imposed 
rather than estimated. Direct tests of nominal versus real interest rates like the one used 
in Chapter 3 are not done, and so there is no way of knowing what the data actually 
support in the FRB/US expenditure equations.
Large stock market effects are also imposed in the FRB/US model. Contrary to the 
estimate of US equation 25, which shows fairly small effects of nominal interest rates 
and nominal earnings on CG, the FRB/US model has extremely large effects. A one- 
percentage-point decrease in the real interest rate leads to a 20 percent increase in the 
value of corporate equity (Reifschneider, Tetlow, and Williams (1999), p. 5). At the 
end of 1999 the value of corporate equity was about $20 trillion (using data from the 
U.S. Flow of Funds accounts), and 20 percent of this is $4 trillion. There is thus a huge 
increase in nominal household wealth for even a one-percentage-point decrease in the 
real interest rate. A positive inflation shock with the nominal interest rate held constant, 
which lowers the real interest rate, thus results in a large increase in both nominal and 
real wealth in the model. The increase in real wealth then leads through the wealth 
effect in the household expenditure equations to a large increase in real expenditures. 
This channel is an important contributor to the model’s not being stable when there is 
an increase in inflation greater than the nominal interest rate. Again, this stock price

effect is imposed rather than estimated, and so it is not necessarily the case that the data 
are consistent with this restriction.
There is thus no puzzle about the vastly different properties of the two models. It is 
simply that important real interest rate restrictions have been imposed in the FRB/US 
model and not in the MC model.
7.4 Conclusion
If a positive inflation shock with the nominal interest rate held constant is in fact 
contractionary, this has important implications for monetary policy. The coefficient 
on inflation in the nominal interest rate rule need not be greater than one for the 
economy to be stable. Also, if one is concerned with optimal policies, the optimal 
response by the Fed to an inflation shock is likely to be much smaller if inflation shocks 
are contractionary than if they are expansionary. The use of modern-view models for 
monetary policy is thus risky. If they are wrong about the effects of inflation shocks, 
they may lead to poor monetary policy recommendations. Optimal policies using the 
MC model are discussed in Chapter 11.

Estimated European Inflation Costs
8.1 
Introduction
If macroeconomic policies had lowered European unemployment in the 1980s, what 
would have been the inflation costs?1 Under the NAIRU model discussed in Chapter 4, 
this is not an interesting question. In that model there is a value of the unemployment 
rate (the NAIRU) below which the price level accelerates and above which the price 
level decelerates. This view of the inflation process is echoed, for example, in Unem­
ployment: Choices for Europe, where Alogoskoufis et al. (1995, p. 124) state, “We 
would not want to dissent from the view that there is no long-run trade-off between 
activity and inflation, so that macroeconomic policies by themselves can do little to 
secure a lasting reduction in unemployment.” Under this view it is not sensible to talk 
about long-run trade-offs between unemployment and inflation.
1. The results in this chapter are updates of those in Fair (1999).
Since the results in Chapter 4 call into question the NAIRU dynamics, it is of interest 
to see what an alternative model would say about the European inflation cost question. 
This chapter uses the MC model to estimate what would have happened to European 
unemployment and inflation in the 1982:1-1990:4 period had the Bundesbank followed 
an easier monetary policy than it in fact did.
If the true relationship between the price level and unemployment is highly nonlinear 
at low values of the unemployment rate, a view put forth in section 4.6, it is problematic 
to consider policy experiments in which unemployment rates are pushed to very low 
values. Because there are few observations at low unemployment rates, it is not possible 
to pin down the point at which the relationship becomes highly nonlinear (if it does), and 
so the estimated price equations are not reliable at low values of the unemployment rate. 
For present purposes, however, this is not likely to be a problem because the experiment 
is over a period in which unemployment was generally quite high.

8.2 || The Experiment

The Experiment
8.2.1 The Setup
The experiment is a decrease in the German short-term interest rate between 1982:1 
and 1990:4. To perform this experiment the interest rate rule of the Bundesbank was 
dropped, and the German short-term interest rate was taken to be exogenous. The 
interest rate rules for all the other countries in the model were retained, which means, for 
example, that the fall in the German rate directly affects the interest rates of the countries 
whose rules have the German rate as an explanatory variable. The German interest rate 
was lowered by 1.0 percentage point for 1982:1-1983:4, by 0.75 percentage points for 
1984:1-1985:4, by 0.5 percentage points for 1986:1-1987:4, and by 0.25 percentage 
points for 1988:1-1990:4.
As in the experiments in the last two chapters, the first step is to add the estimated 
residuals to the model and take them to be exogenous. Doing this and then solving 
the model using the actual values of all the exogenous variables results in a perfect 
tracking solution. The German interest rate is then lowered and the model is solved. 
The difference between the predicted value for each variable for each period from this 
solution and its actual value is the estimated effect of the monetary-policy change on the 
variable. Selected results of this experiment are presented in Table 8.1 for six countries: 
Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan. Each fourth­
quarter value is presented in the table.
The second column in Table 8.1, labeled UR, gives the actual value of the unem­
ployment rate in percentage points, and the third column, labeled jt, gives the actual 
value of the inflation rate (percentage change in the GDP price deflator at an annual rate) 
in percentage points. These values are provided for reference purposes. The values in 
the remaining columns are either absolute or percentage changes from the base values 
(remember that the base values are the actual values). Absolute changes are given for 
the interest rate, the unemployment rate, the inflation rate, and the current account as 
a fraction of GDP, while percentage changes are given for the other variables. All the 
values are in percentage points.
8.2.2 Qualitative Discussion
Before discussing the numbers, it will be useful to review qualitatively what is likely to 
happen in the model in response to the decrease in the German interest rate.2 Consider 
first the effects of an interest rate decrease in a particular country. A decrease in the 
short-term rate in a country leads to a decrease in the long-term rate through the term 
structure equation. A decrease in the short-term rate also leads to a depreciation of 
the country’s currency (assuming that the interest rate decrease is relative to other
2. It may also be useful to review the qualitative discussion in section 2.3 regarding the effects of a 
depreciation and an interest rate decrease in the MC model. Some of the discussion here repeats this earlier 
discussion.

countries’ interest rates). The interest rate decreases lead to an increase in consumption 
and investment. The depreciation of the currency leads to an increase in exports. The 
effect on exports works through the trade-share equations. The dollar price of the 
country’s exports that feeds into the trade-share equations is lower because of the 
depreciation, and this increases the share of the other countries’ total imports imported 
from the particular country. The effect on aggregate demand in the country from the 
interest rate decrease is thus positive from the increase in consumption, investment, and 
exports.
There are two main effects on imports, one positive and one negative. The positive 
effect is that consumption and investment are higher, some of which is imported. The 
negative effect is that the price of imports is higher because of the depreciation, which 
has a negative effect on the demand for imports. The net effect on imports can thus go 
either way.
There is also a positive effect on inflation. As just noted, the depreciation leads to 
an increase in the price of imports. This in turn has a positive effect on the domestic 
price level through the price equation. In addition, if aggregate demand increases, 
this increases demand pressure, which has a positive effect on the domestic price 
level.
There are many other effects that follow from these, including effects back on 
the short-term interest rate itself through the interest rate rule, but these are typically

second order in nature, especially in the short run. The main effects are as just de­
scribed.
The decrease in the German interest rate should thus stimulate the German economy, 
depreciate the DM, and lead to a rise in the German price level. How much the price level 
rises depends, among other things, on the size of the coefficient estimate of the demand 
pressure variable in the German price equation. The size of the price level increase also 
depends on how much the DM depreciates and on the size of the coefficient estimate 
of the import price variable in the price equation.
For those European countries whose interest rate rules include the German interest 
rate as an explanatory variable, the fall in the German rate will lead to a direct fall in 
their interest rates. In addition, the depreciation of the DM (relative to the dollar) will 
lead to a depreciation of the other European countries’ currencies (relative to the dollar) 
because they are fairly closely tied to the DM in the short run through the exchange 
rate equations.
8.2.3 The Results
Turn now to the results in Table 8.1. By the end of the nine-year period the German 
exchange rate relative to the dollar, E, depreciated 4.80 percent, the price level, PY, 
was 4.16 percent higher, the inflation rate, n, was 0.61 percentage points higher, and 
the unemployment rate, UR, was 1.20 percentage points lower—all compared with the 
base case (the actual values). (An increase in E for a country is a depreciation of the 
country’s currency relative to the dollar.) The current account as a percentage of GDP, 
5*,  was 0.11 percentage points lower: German imports, IM, rose more than German 
exports, EX, while the increases in German import prices, PM, and German export 
prices, PX, were similar.
The interest rate, RS, for France fell because French monetary policy is directly 
affected by German monetary policy. (The German interest rate is an explanatory 
variable in the French interest rate rule.) By the end of the period the French exchange 
rate had depreciated 2.58 percent, the price level was 1.31 percent higher, the inflation 
rate was 0.10 percentage points higher, and the unemployment rate was 0.74 percentage 
points lower. Note that although both the DM and the French franc depreciated relative 
to the dollar (4.80 and 2.58 percent, respectively), the franc depreciated less and thus 
appreciated relative to the DM. This is because of the smaller rise in the domestic price 
level in France than in Germany.
The Italian lira is closely tied to the DM through equation 9 for Italy in the model, 
and the lira depreciated almost as much as the DM. This led to a rise in the Italian 
price level, which led, through the Italian interest rate rule, to an increase in the Italian 
interest rate. This offset much of the stimulus from the depreciation. By the end of the 
period the price level was 1.83 percent higher, the inflation rate 0.24 percentage points 
higher, and the unemployment rate 0.35 percentage points lower.
For the United Kingdom the pound depreciated relative to the dollar, but by much 
less than did the DM. The pound thus appreciated relative to the DM (and other 
European currencies), and this appreciation was large enough to lead to a slight decrease 
in the overall UK import price deflator for some of the period. This in turn had a slight

negative effect on the UK domestic price level for some of the period. The effects on 
the UK real variables were modest.
The main effect on the United States was a fall in the price of imports, caused by the 
appreciation of the dollar relative to the European currencies. This led to a slight fall in 
the U.S. domestic price level. U.S. imports increased because the price of imports fell 
relative to the domestic price level and because output was slightly higher. The effect 
on U.S. output was small. Similarly, the Japanese price of imports fell, and there was a 
slight fall in the Japanese domestic price level. Japanese imports also increased slightly.
8.3 
Conclusion
Table 8.2 summarizes some of the results from Table 8.1. Going out 36 quarters, the cost 
for Germany of a 1.20 percentage point fall in the unemployment rate is a 4.16 percent 
rise in the price level. At the end of the period inflation is still higher than the base rate by 
0.61 percentage points. For France the fall in the unemployment rate is 0.74 percentage 
points and the rise in inflation is 0.10 percentage points. The corresponding numbers 
for Italy are 0.35 and 0.24, and the corresponding numbers for the United Kingdom are 
0.16 and 0.22. Whether these costs are considered worth incurring depends on one’s 
welfare function. Given the estimated costs in Table 8.2, some would surely argue that 
the Bundesbank should have been more expansionary in the 1980s.
The accuracy of the present results depends, of course, on the accuracy of the 
price and wage equations in the MC model. The results in Chapter 4 support the MC 
equations’ dynamics over the NAIRU dynamics, which thus provides some support for 
the present results. Remember that the present results are not governed by the NAIRU 
dynamics. It is not the case that an experiment like this will result in accelerating price 
levels, so there are no horrible events lurking beyond the 36-quarter horizon of the 
present experiment.
Finally, remember that the MC estimates of the price and wage equations do not pin 
down the point at which the relationship between the price level and unemployment 
becomes nonlinear. As noted at the end of section 8.1, this is not likely to be a problem 
for the experiment in this chapter because it is over a period in which unemployment 
was generally quite high. It would not be sensible, however, to, say, triple the size of 
the German interest rate decrease and examine the inflation consequences.

Stochastic Simulation and 
Bootstrapping
9.1 Stochastic Simulation
So far in this book solutions have all been deterministic: the error terms have been 
set to fixed values and the model solved once.1 The use of fixed error terms is relaxed 
beginning with this chapter.
1. The results in this chapter are the same as those in Fair (2003b).
2. Although normality is usually assumed in the literature, other assumptions are possible. Alternative 
assumptions simply change the way the error terms are drawn.
Stochastic simulation has a long history in macroeconomics. The seminal paper 
in this area is Adelman and Adelman (1959), which introduced the idea of drawing 
errors to analyze the properties of econometric models. In the present context stochastic 
simulation is as follows.
The model considered is model 1.1 in section 1.4, which is repeated here:
fi(yt, yt_[,. ■ ■, yt_p, xt,aj) = uit, i = 1,..., n, t = 1,..., T, (1.1)
where the first m equations are stochastic. Assume that the vector of error terms, 
ut — (ult, . . . , umt)', is distributed as multivariate normal N(0, S), where S is an 
m x m covariance matrix.1 2 Given consistent estimates of ah denoted ah consistent 
estimates of uit, denoted uit, can be computed as fi(yt, yt-\, ..., yt-p, xt, a,). The 
covariance matrix E can then be estimated as(\/T)UUr, where U is them x T matrix 
of the values of uit.
Let u*  denote a particular draw of the m error terms for period t from the N(0, S) 
distribution. Given u*  and given for all i, one can solve the model for period t. This is 
merely a deterministic simulation for the given values of the error terms and coefficients. 
Call this simulation a “repetition.” Another repetition can be made by drawing a new 
set of values of u*  and solving again. This can be done as many times as desired. 
From each repetition one obtains a prediction of each endogenous variable. Let y-t

J=1
In many applications, one is interested in predicted values more than one period 
ahead, that is, in predicted values from dynamic simulations. The above discussion can 
be easily modified to incorporate this case. One simply draws values for ut for each 
period of the simulation. Each repetition is one dynamic simulation over the period of 
interest. For, say, an eight-quarter period, each repetition yields eight predicted values, 
one per quarter, for each endogenous variable.
It is also possible to draw coefficients for the repetitions. Let a denote, say, the 2SLS 
estimate of all the coefficients in the model, and let V denote the estimate of the k x k 
covariance matrix of a. Given V and given the normality assumption, an estimate of 
the distribution of the coefficient estimates is N(a, V). When coefficients are drawn, 
each repetition consists of a draw of the coefficient vector from N(a, V) and draws of 
the error terms as above.
Early stochastic simulation that treated coefficient estimates as fixed include Na- 
gar (1969), Evans, Klein, and Saito (1972), Fromm, Klein, and Schink (1972), 
Green, Leibenberg, and Hirsch (1972), Cooper and Fischer (1972), Sowey (1973), 
Cooper (1974), Garbade (1975), Bianchi, Calzolari, and Corsi (1976), and Calzo- 
lari and Corsi (1977). Studies that drew both error terms and coefficients include 
Schink (1971), Haitovsky and Wallace (1972), Cooper and Fischer (1974), Muench 
et al. (1974), Schink (1974), and Fair (1980a).
It is also possible to draw errors from estimated residuals rather than from estimated 
distributions, although this has rarely been done. In a theoretical paper Brown and

simulation estimates and thus to examine the precision of the estimates. The variance of iljt is simply

Mariano (1984) analyzed the procedure of drawing errors from the residuals for a 
static nonlinear econometric model with fixed coefficient estimates. For the stochastic 
simulation results in Fair (1998) errors were drawn from estimated residuals for a 
dynamic, nonlinear, simultaneous equations model with fixed coefficient estimates, 
and this may have been the first time this approach was used for such models. An 
advantage of drawing from estimated residuals is that no assumption has to be made 
about the distribution of the error terms.
9.2 
Bootstrapping
The bootstrap was introduced in statistics in 1979 by Efron (1979).4 Although the 
bootstrap procedure is obviously related to stochastic simulation, the literature that 
followed Efron’s paper stressed the use of the bootstrap for estimation and the evalu­
ation of estimators, not for evaluating models’ properties. Although there is by now a 
large literature on the use of the bootstrap in economics (as well as in statistics), most 
of it has focused on small time-series models. Good recent reviews are Li and Mad- 
dala (1996), Horowitz (1997), Berkowitz and Kilian (2000), and Hardie, Horowitz, and 
Kreiss (2001).
4. See Hall (1992) for the history of resampling ideas in statistics prior to Efron’s paper.
The main purpose of this chapter is to integrate for model 1.1 (that is, a dynamic, 
nonlinear, simultaneous equations model) the bootstrap approach to evaluating esti­
mators and the stochastic simulation approach to evaluating models’ properties. The 
procedure in section 9.4 for treating coefficient uncertainty has not been used before 
for these kinds of models. This chapter also contains estimates of the gain in coverage 
accuracy from using bootstrap confidence intervals over asymptotic intervals for the 
US model. It will be seen that the gain is fairly large for this model.
The paper closest to the present work is Freedman (1984), who considered the 
bootstrapping of the 2SLS estimator in a dynamic, linear, simultaneous equations 
model. Runkle (1987) used the bootstrap to examine impulse response functions in 
VAR models, and Kilian (1998) extended this work to correct for bias. There is also 
work on bootstrapping GMM estimators (see, for example, Hall and Horowitz (1996)), 
but this work is of limited relevance here because it does not assume knowledge of a 
complete model.
In his review of bootstrapping MacKinnon (2002) analyzes an example of a linear 
simultaneous equations model consisting of one structural equation and one reduced- 
form equation. He points out (p. 14) that “bootstrapping even one equation of a simulta­
neous equations model is a good deal more complicated than bootstrapping an equation 
in which all the explanatory variables are exogenous or predetermined. The problem is 
that the bootstrap DGP must provide a way to generate all of the endogenous variables, 
not just one of them.” In this chapter the process generating the endogenous variables 
is the complete model 1.1.

9.3 || Distribution of the Coefficient Estimates
117
This chapter does not provide the theoretical restrictions on model 1.1 that are 
needed for the bootstrap procedure to be valid. Assumptions beyond iid errors and the 
existence of a consistent estimator are needed, but these have not been worked out in the 
literature for the model considered here. This chapter simply assumes that the model 
meets whatever restrictions are sufficient for the bootstrap procedure to be valid. Its 
contribution is to apply the procedure to model 1.1 and to estimate the gain in coverage 
accuracy assuming the procedure is valid. It remains to be seen what restrictions are 
needed beyond iid errors and a consistent estimator. As will be seen, however, it is the 
case that the bootstrap works well regarding coverage accuracy when the US model 
is taken to be the truth. Given this, it seems likely that the US model falls within the 
required conditions for validity.
Section 9.3 discusses the use of the bootstrap to evaluate coefficient estimates, and 
it uses the US model to estimate coverage accuracy. Section 9.4 discusses the use of 
the bootstrap to analyze models’ properties, and section 9.5 discusses bias correction. 
The bootstrap procedure is applied in section 9.6 to the US model.
9.3 
Distribution of the Coefficient Estimates
9.3.1 Initial Estimation
Let a denote the vector of all the unknown coefficients in the model, a = (c^, . . ., o^)', 
and let u denote the vector of errors for all the available periods, u = (u^, . . . , u'Tf, 
where ut is defined in section 9.1. It is assumed that a consistent estimate of a is 
available, denoted a. This could be, for example, the 2SLS or 3SLS estimate of a. 
Given this estimate and the actual data, u can be estimated. Let u denote the estimate of 
u after the residuals have been centered at zero.5 Statistics of interest can be analyzed 
using the bootstrap procedure. These can include t-statisties of the coefficient estimates 
and possible y2 statistics for various hypotheses. For the results in section 9.6 the AP 
test statistic is examined, r will be used to denote the vector of estimated statistics of 
interest.
5. Freedman (1981) has shown that the bootstrap can fail for an equation with no constant term if the 
residuals are not centered at zero. For all the results reported in this chapter centering has been done. >From 
model 1.1, m,f, an element of u, is f-fyt, yt_\, ..., yt-p, xt, a,) except for the adjustment that centers the 
residuals at zero.
6. This is just a standard dynamic simulation, where instead of using zero values for the error terms the 
drawn values are used.
9.3.2 The Bootstrap Procedure
The bootstrap procedure for evaluating estimators for model 1.1 is:
1. For a given trial j, draw u J from u with replacement for t — 1, ..., T. Use these 
errors and a to solve the model dynamically for t = 1, . . . , T.  Treat the solution 
values as actual values and estimate a by the consistent estimator (2SLS, 3SLS, or 
*
6

118
9 || Stochastic Simulation and Bootstrapping
whatever). Let a*>  denote this estimate. Compute also the test statistics of interest, 
and let r* 7 denote the vector of these values.
7. See Li and Maddala (1996), pp. 118-121, for a review of the number of ways confidence intervals 
can be computed using the bootstrap. See also Hall (1988).
2. Repeat step 1 for j = 1, . . ., J.
Step 2 gives J estimates of each element of a*>  and r* 7. Using these values, confidence 
intervals for the coefficient estimates can be computed (see below). Also, for the orig­
inally estimated value of any test statistic, one can see where it lies on the distribution 
of the J values.
Note that each trial generates a new data set. Each data set is generated using the 
same coefficient vector (a), but in general the data set has different errors for a period 
from those that existed historically. Note also that since the drawing is with replacement, 
the same error vector may be drawn more than once in a given trial, while others may 
not be drawn at all. All data sets are conditional on the actual values of the endogenous 
variables prior to period 1 and on the actual values of the exogenous variables for all 
periods.
9.3.3 Estimating Coverage Accuracy
Three confidence intervals are empirically examined here.7 Let denote a particular 
coefficient in a. Let ft denote the base estimate (2SLS, 3SLS, or whatever) of fl, and 
let <7 denote its estimated asymptotic standard error. Let )3*
7 denote the estimate of 
fl on the jth trial, and let <7
*
7 denote the estimated asymptotic standard error of 3* J. 
Let t* 7 equal the ^-statistic ()3
*
7 — /?)/<7
*
7. Assume that the J values of t* 7 have been 
ranked, and let t*  denote the value below which r percent of the values of ?* 7 lie. Finally, 
let |r* 71 denote the absolute value of ?* 7. Assume that the J values of |?* 7| have been 
ranked, and let |t*|
r denote the value below which r percent of the values of |?* 7| lie. 
The first confidence interval is simply fl ± 1.96<7, which is the 95 percent confidence 
interval from the asymptotic normal distribution. The second is (3 —
which is the equal-tailed percentile-? interval. The third is ± l7*l.95o<U  which is the 
symmetric percentile-? interval.
The following Monte Carlo procedure is used to examine the accuracy of the three 
intervals. This procedure assume that the data generating process is model 1.1 with true 
coefficients a.
1. For a given repetition k, draw u
k from u with replacement for t = 1, . . . , T. 
Use these errors and a to solve the model dynamically for t — 1, . . ., T. Treat the 
solution values as actual values and estimate a by the consistent estimator (2SLS, 
3SLS, or whatever). Let 6i
k denote this estimate. Use this estimate and the solution 
values from the dynamic simulation to compute the residuals, u, and center them 
**

at zero. Let u** k denote the estimate of u after the residuals have been centered at 
zero.8
8. From model 1.1, u*fk, an element of u**k, is ffy**k, y**\, ... , y**k, xt, 6t**k) except for the 
adjustment that centers the residuals at zero, where y**k is the solution value of yt_h from the dynamic 
simulation (h = 0, 1, . . ., p).
2. Perform steps 1 and 2 in section 9.3.2, where u
k replaces it and a
k replaces a. 
Compute from these J trials the three confidence intervals discussed above, where 
fi
k replaces ft and a
k replaces <f. Record for each interval whether or not /3 is 
outside of the interval.
**
**
**
**
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for k — 1, . .., K.
After completion of the K repetitions, one can compute for each coefficient and each 
interval the percentage of the repetitions that f was outside the interval. For, say, a 
95 percent confidence interval, the difference between the computed percentage and 
5 percent is the error in coverage probability.
This procedure was used on the US model to examine coverage accuracy. For all 
the work in this chapter, equation 9, the demand for money equation explaining MH, 
has been dropped from the model and MH has been taken to be exogenous. As noted in 
Chapter 2, the sum of the four autoregressive coefficients in equation 9 is close to one. 
If the equation is retained, some of the estimates for the bootstrap calculations have a 
sum greater than one, and this can lead to solution problems. Remember that this is not 
an important equation in the model.
For the work in this section both J and K were taken to be 350, for a total of 122,500 
times the model was estimated (by 2SLS). There were 847 solution failures out of the 
122,500 trials, and these failures were skipped. The job took about 40 hours on a 1.7 
Ghz PC, about one second per estimation. The results are summarized in Table 9.1. 
Rejection rates are presented for 12 of the coefficients in the model. The average for 
the 12 coefficients is presented as well as the average for all 164 coefficients in the 
model. The standard deviation for the 164 coefficients is also presented.
The average rejection rate over the 164 coefficients is .085 for the asymptotic inter­
val, which compares to .063 and .056 for the two bootstrap intervals. The asymptotic 
distribution thus rejects too often, and the bootstrap distributions are fairly accurate. Al­
though not shown in Table 9.1, the results are similar if 90 percent confidence intervals 
are used. In this case the asymptotic rejection rate averaged across the 164 coefficients 
is .145 (standard deviation of .055). The corresponding values for the two bootstrap 
intervals are .113 (standard deviation of 030) and .107 (standard deviation of .029). As 
noted in section 9.1, given the good bootstrap results it seems likely that the US model 
falls within the required conditions for validity of the bootstrap.
It is interesting to note that although the bootstrap intervals outperform the asymp­
totic intervals, the asymptotic results are not terrible. One rejects too often using the 
asymptotic intervals, but the use of the asymptotic intervals does not seem likely to be 
highly misleading in practice.

Analysis of Models’ Properties
The bootstrap procedure is extended in this section to evaluating properties of models 
like model 1.1. The errors are drawn from the estimated residuals, which is contrary 
to what has been done in the previous literature except for Fair (1998). Also, as in 
section 9.3.2, the coefficients are estimated on each trial. In the previous literature 
the coefficient estimates either have been taken to be fixed or have been drawn from 
estimated distributions.
When examining the properties of models, one is usually interested in a pe­
riod smaller than the estimation period. Assume that the period of interest is 5

through S, where 5 > 1 and S <T. The bootstrap procedure for analyzing proper­
ties is:
1. For a given trial j, draw u J from u with replacement for t — 1, ..., T. Use these 
errors and a to solve model 1.1 dynamically for t = 1, . . ., T. Treat the solution 
values as actual values and estimate a by the consistent estimator (2SLS, 3SLS, or 
whatever). Let a  denote this estimate. Discard the solution values; they are not 
used again.

* 7
2. Draw u ] from u with replacement for t — s, . . . , S? Use these errors and a
 
to solve model 1.1 dynamically for t = s, . . . , S. Record the solution value of 
each endogenous variable for each period. This simulation and the next one use 
the actual (historical) values of the variables prior to period 5, not the values used 
in computing a
.
*
* 7
* 7
3. Multiplier experiments can be performed. The solution from step 2 is the base path. 
For a multiplier experiment one or more exogenous variables are changed and the 
model is solved again. The difference between the second solution value and the base 
value for a given endogenous variable and period is the model’s estimated effect of 
the change. Record these differences.
4. Repeat steps 1, 2, and 3 for j — 1, ..., J.
5. Step 4 gives J values of each endogenous variable for each period. It also gives 
J values of each difference for each period if a multiplier experiment has been 
performed.
9. If desired, these errors can be the same errors drawn in step 1 for the .v through S period. With a large 
enough number of trials, whether one does this or instead draws new errors makes a trivial difference. It is 
assumed here that new errors are drawn.
10. The use of stochastic simulation to estimate event probabilities was first discussed in Fair (1993a), 
where the coefficient estimates were taken to be fixed and errors were drawn from estimated distribu­
tions. Estimating the uncertainty of multiplier or policy effects in nonlinear models was first discussed in 
Fair (1980b), where both errors and coefficients were drawn from estimated distributions.
A distribution of J predicted values of each endogenous variable for each period 
is now available to examine. One can compute, for example, various measures of 
dispersion, which are estimates of the accuracy of the model. Probabilities of specific 
events happening can also be computed. If, say, one is interested in the event of two or 
more consecutive periods of negative growth in real output in the 5 through S period, 
one can compute the number of times this happened in the J trials. If a multiplier 
experiment has been performed, a distribution of J differences for each endogenous 
variable for each period is also available to examine. This allows the uncertainty of 
policy effects in the model to be examined.9 10
If the coefficient estimates are taken to be fixed, then step 1 above is skipped. 
The same coefficient vector (a) is used for all the solutions. Although in much of the 
stochastic simulation literature coefficient estimates have been taken to be fixed, this is 
not in the spirit of the bootstrap literature. From a bootstrapping perspective, the obvious 

122
9 || Stochastic Simulation and Bootstrapping
procedure to follow after the errors have been drawn is to first estimate the model and 
then examine its properties, which is what the above procedure does. For estimating 
event probabilities, however, one may want to take the coefficient estimates to be fixed. 
In this case step 1 above is skipped. If step 1 is skipped, the question being asked is: 
conditional on the model, including the coefficient estimates, what is the probability 
that the particular event will occur?
9.5 
Bias Correction
Since 2SLS and 3SLS estimates are biased, it may be useful to use the bootstrap proce­
dure to correct for bias. This is especially true for estimates of lagged dependent variable 
coefficients. It has been known since the work of Orcutt (1948) and Hurwicz (1950) 
that least squares estimates of these coefficients are biased downward even when there 
are no right-hand-side endogenous variables.
In the present context a bias-correction procedure using the bootstrap is as follows.
1. From step 2 in section 9.3.2 there are J values of each coefficient available. Compute 
the mean value for each coefficient, and let a denote the vector of the mean values. 
Let y — a — a, the estimated bias. Compute the coefficient vector a — y and use 
the coefficients in this vector to adjust the constant term in each equation so that the 
mean of the error terms is zero. Let a denote a — y except for the constant terms, 
which are as adjusted, a is then taken to be the unbiased estimate of a. Let 0 denote 
the vector of estimated biases: 0 — a — a.
2. Using a and the actual data, compute the errors. Denote the error vector as u. (u is 
centered at zero because of the constant term adjustment in step 1.)
3. The steps in section 9.4 can now be performed, where a replaces a and it replaces u. 
The only difference is that after the coefficient vector is estimated by 2SLS, 3SLS, 
or whatever, it has 0 subtracted from it to correct for bias. In other words, subtract 
0 from a'
 on each trial.
*
11
11. One could for each trial do a bootstrap to estimate the bias—a bootstrap within a bootstrap. The base 
coefficients would be cr7 and the base data would be the generated data on trial j. This is expensive, and 
an approximation is simply to use 9 on each trial. This is the procedure used by Kilian (1998) in estimating 
confidence intervals for impulse responses in VAR models. Kilian (1998) also does, when necessary, a 
stationary correction to the bias correction to avoid pushing stationary impulse response estimates into the 
nonstationary region. This type of adjustment is not pursued here.
The example in section 9.6 examines the sensitivity of some of the results to the bias 
correction.

An Example Using the US Model
In this section the overall bootstrap procedure is applied to the US model, where the 
estimation period is 1954:1-2002:3 and the estimation method is 2SLS. 11

9.6 || An Example Using the US Model
123
The calculations were run in one large batch job. The main steps were:
1. Estimate the 29 equations  by 2SLS for 1954:1-2002:3. Compute standard errors 
of the coefficient estimates, and perform the Andrews-Ploberger (1994) (AP) test on 
selected equations. Using the 2SLS estimates and zero values for the errors, solve the 
model dynamically for 2000:4-2002:3 (the last eight quarters of the overall period) 
and perform a multiplier experiment for this period. Using the actual data and the 
2SLS estimates, compute the 29-dimensional error vectors for 1954:1-2002:3 (195 
vectors).
12
2. Do the following 2,000 times: (1) draw with replacement 195 error vectors from 
the residual vectors for 1954:1-2002:3; (2) using the drawn errors and the 2SLS 
estimates from step 1, solve the model dynamically for 1954:1-2002:3 to get new 
data; (3) using the new data, estimate the model by 2SLS, compute f-statistics 
for the coefficient estimates, and perform the AP tests; (4) reset the data prior to 
2000:4 to the actual data; (5) draw with replacement eight error vectors from the 
residual vectors for 2000:4-2002:3; (6) using the new 2SLS estimates and the drawn 
errors, solve the model dynamically for 2000:4-2002:3 and perform the multiplier 
experiment for this period.
3. Step 2 gives for each equation 2,000 values of each coefficient estimate, ^-statistic, 
and AP statistic. It also gives 2,000 predicted values of each endogenous variable 
for each quarter within 2000:4-2002:3 and 2,000 differences for each endogenous 
variable and each quarter from the multiplier experiment. These values can be 
analyzed as desired. Some examples are given below. Steps 4-6 that follow are 
the bias-correction calculations.
4. From the 2,000 values for each coefficient, compute the mean and then subtract the 
mean from twice the 2SLS coefficient estimate from step 1. Use these values to ad­
just the constant term in each equation so that the mean of the error terms is zero. 
Using these coefficients (including the adjusted constant terms), record the differ­
ences between the 2SLS coefficient estimates from step 1 and these coefficients. 
Call the vector of these values the “bias-correction vector.” Using the new coeffi­
cients and zero values for the errors, solve the model dynamically for 2000:4-2002:3 
and perform the multiplier experiment for this period. Using the actual data and the 
new coefficients, compute the 29-dimensional error vectors for 1954:1-2002:3 (195 
vectors).
5. Do the following 2,000 times: (1) draw with replacement 195 error vectors from the 
residual vectors from step 4 for 1954:1-2002:3; (2) using the drawn errors and the 
coefficients from step 4, solve the model dynamically for 1954:1-2002:3 to get new 
data; (3) using the new data, estimate the model by 2SLS and adjust the estimates for 
bias using the bias-correction vector from step 4; (4) reset the data prior to 2000:4 
to the actual data; (5) draw with replacement eight error vectors from the residual

vectors from step 4 for 2000:4-2002:3; (6) using the new coefficient estimates and 
the drawn errors, solve the model dynamically for 2000:4-2002:3 and perform the 
multiplier experiment for this period.
6. Step 5 gives 2,000 predicted values of each endogenous variable for each quarter 
within 2000:4-2002:3 and 2,000 differences for each endogenous variable and each 
quarter from the multiplier experiment.
The same sequence of random numbers was used for the regular calculations 
(steps 1-3) as was used for the bias-correction calculations (steps 4-6). This lessens 
stochastic simulation error in comparisons between the two sets of results. If the model 
failed to solve for a given trial (either for the 1954:1-2002:3 period or the 2000:4­
2002:3 period), the trial was skipped. No failures occurred for the regular calculations, 
but there were 5 failures out of the 2,000 trials for the bias-correction calculations. 
Each trial takes about one second on a 1.7 GHz PC using the Fair-Parke (1995) 
program.
Table 9.2 presents some results from step 2 for the coefficient estimates. Results 
for 12 coefficients from 5 equations are presented. The 5 equations are the three 
consumption equations 1-3, the price equation 5, and the interest rate rule 30. The 
coefficients are for the lagged dependent variable in each equation, for income in each 
consumption equation, for the price of imports and the unemployment rate in the price 
equation, and for inflation and the unemployment rate in the interest rate rule. These 
are some of the main coefficients in the model. The first three columns show the 2SLS 
estimate, the mean from the 2,000 trials, and the ratio of the two. As expected, the mean 
is smaller than the 2SLS estimate for all the lagged dependent variable coefficients: the 
2SLS estimates of these coefficients are biased downward. The smallest ratio is 0.966, 
a bias of 3.4 percent.
Column 4 gives the asymptotic confidence intervals; column 5 gives the confidence 
intervals using the equal-tailed percentile-t interval; and column 6 gives the symmetric 
percentile-t interval using the absolute values of the t-statistics. These columns show 
that the asymptotic intervals tend to be narrower than the bootstrap intervals. In 19 of 
the 24 cases the left value for the asymptotic interval is larger than the left value for the 
bootstrap interval, and in 19 of the 24 cases the right value for the asymptotic interval 
is smaller than the right value for the bootstrap interval. The asymptotic intervals will 
thus tend to reject more often than the bootstrap intervals. It was seen in section 9.3.3 
that the asymptotic interval rejects too often.
Table 9.3 presents results for the AP test for five equations: the three consumption 
equations, the residential investment equation, and the price equation.13 The overall 
sample period is 1954:1-2002:3, and the period for a possible break was taken to be 
1970:1-1979:4. These are the same periods as were used in Chapter 2 for the results 
in Table A.4 in Appendix A. Table 9.3 gives for each equation the computed AP value,
13. The test was not performed for the interest rate rule because the equation is already estimated under 
the assumption of a change in Fed behavior in the 1979:4-1982:3 period.

the bootstrap confidence values, and the asymptotic confidence values. The asymptotic 
confidence values are taken from Table 1 in Andrews and Ploberger (1994). The value 
of X in the AP notation for the present results is 2.29. The bootstrap confidence values 
for an equation are computed using the 2,000 values of the AP statistic. The 5 percent 
value, for example, is the value above which 100 of the AP values lie.
There is a clear pattern in Table 9.3, which is that the asymptotic confidence values 
are too low. They lead to rejection of the null hypothesis of stability too often. Relying 
on the asymptotic values for the AP test thus appears to be too harsh.
Table 9.4 presents results for the simulations for 2000:4-2002:3. Results for four 
variables are presented: the log of real GDP, the log of the GDP price deflator, the 
unemployment rate, and the three-month Treasury bill rate. Four sets of results are pre­
sented: with and without coefficient uncertainty and with and without bias correction.14 
Consider the first set of results (upper left corner) in Table 9.4. The first column gives 
the deterministic prediction (based on setting the error terms to zero and solving once), 
and the second gives the median value of the 2,000 predictions. These two values are 
close to each other, which means there is little bias in the deterministic prediction. The 
third column gives the difference between the median predicted value and the predicted 
value below which 15.87 percent of the values lie, and the fourth column gives the dif­
ference between the predicted value above which 15.87 percent of the values lie and the
14. The results without coefficient uncertainty were obtained in a separate batch job. This batch job 
differed from the one outlined at the beginning of this section in that in part (6) of step 2 the 2SLS estimates 
from step 1 are used, not the new 2SLS estimates. Also, in part (6) of step 5 the coefficients from step 4 are 
used, not the new coefficient estimates. For this job there were no solution failures for the regular calculations 
and three failures for the bias-correction calculations.

median value. For a normal distribution these two differences are the same and equal 
one standard error. Computing these differences is one possible way of measuring pre­
dictive uncertainty in the model. The same differences are presented for the other three 
sets of results in Table 9.4.
Three conclusions can be drawn from the results in Table 9.4. First, the left and right 
differences are fairly close to each other. Second, the differences with no coefficient 
uncertainty are only slightly smaller than those with coefficient uncertainty, and so 
most of the predictive uncertainty is due to the additive errors. Third, the bias-correction 
results are fairly similar to the non-bias-correction ones, which suggests that bias is not 
a major problem in the model. In most cases the uncertainty estimates are larger for the 
bias-correction results.

are multipliers15 rather than predicted values. The first column gives the multiplier 
computed from deterministic simulations, and the second gives the median value of 
the 2,000 multipliers. As in Table 9.3, these two values are close to each other. The 
third column gives the difference between the median multiplier and the multiplier 
below which 15.87 percent of the values lie, and the fourth column gives the difference 
between the multiplier above which 15.87 percent of the values lie and the median 
multiplier. These two columns are measures of the uncertainty of the government 
spending effect in the model.
15. The word “multiplier” is used here to refer to the difference between the predicted value of a variable 
after the policy change and the predicted value of the variable before the change. This difference is not, 
strictly speaking, a multiplier, because it is not divided by the government spending change.
Three conclusions can be drawn from the results in Table 9.5. First, the left and 
right differences are fairly close to each other. Second, the differences are fairly small 
relative to the size of the multipliers, and so the estimated policy uncertainty is fairly 
small for a government spending change. Third, the bias-correction results are similar 
to the non-bias-correction ones, which again suggests that bias is not a major problem 
in the model.
9.7 Conclusion
This chapter has outlined a bootstrapping approach to the estimation and analysis of 
dynamic, nonlinear, simultaneous equations models. It draws on the bootstrapping 
literature initiated by Efron (1979) and the stochastic simulation literature initiated by 
Adelman and Adelman (1959). The procedure in section 9.4 has not been used before for 
these models. The procedure is distribution free, and it allows a wide range of questions 
to be considered, including estimation, prediction, and policy analysis.
The results in section 9.6 are suggestive of the usefulness of the bootstrapping 
procedure for models like model 1.1. Computations like those in Table 9.3 can be 
done for many different statistics. Computations like those in Table 9.4 can be used 
to compare different models, where various measures of dispersion can be considered. 
These measures account for uncertainty from both the additive error terms and the 
coefficient estimates, which puts models on an equal footing if they have similar sets 
of exogenous variables. Computations like those in Table 9.5 can be done for a wide 
variety of policy experiments. Finally, the results in Table 9.1 show that the bootstrap 
works well for the US model regarding coverage accuracy.

Certainty Equivalence
10.1 
Introduction
In section 1.7 a procedure for solving optimal control problems for models like 
model 1.1 was outlined. This method is based on the assumption of certainty equiv­
alence (CE), which is strictly valid only for a linear model and a quadratic objective 
function. The advantage of using CE is that if the error terms are set to their expected 
values (usually zero), the computational work is simply to solve an unconstrained non­
linear optimization problem, and there are many algorithms available for doing this. 
This chapter examines in specific cases how much is lost when using CE for nonlinear 
models. The model used is the US model.
The results are quite encouraging regarding the CE assumption. They show that little 
accuracy is lost using the CE assumption when solving optimal control problems.
10.2 
Analytic Results
It is difficult to find in the literature analytic comparisons of truly optimal and CE 
solutions. One example is in Binder, Pesaran, and Samiei (2000), who examine the 
finite horizon life cycle model of consumption under uncertainty. They consider the 
simple case of a negative exponential utility function, a constant rate of interest, and 
labor income following an arithmetic random walk. In this case it is possible to compute 
both the truly optimal and the CE solutions analytically.
Using these authors’ solution code,11 computed for different horizons both the truly 
optimal and the certainty equivalence solutions. These computations are based on the 
following values: interest rate = .04; discount factor = .98; negative exponential utility 
parameter = .01; initial and terminal values of wealth = 500; initial value of income = 
200; standard deviation of random walk error = 5.

10.3 || Relaxing the CE Assumption
131
Let denote the truly optimal first-period value of consumption, and let c**  denote 
the value computed under the assumption of certainty equivalence. For a life cycle 
horizon of 12 years, c*  was 0.30 percent below c**
.
 For 24 years it was 0.60 percent 
below; for 36 years it was 0.87 percent below; and for 48 years it was 1.09 percent 
below. Although these differences seem modest, it is not clear how much they can be 
generalized, given the specialized nature of the model. This chapter provides results in 
a more general framework.
10.3 
Relaxing the CE Assumption
Recall from section 1.7 that the control problem is to maximize the expected value of 
W with respect to the S — 5 + 1 control values, subject to the model 1.1. The equation 
for W is repeated here:
s
W = £8,(>',.V 
(10.1)
t=s
The vector of control variables is denoted zt, where zt is a subset of xt, and z is the 
vector of all the control values: z — (zv, . . . , zs). The problem under CE is to choose 
z to maximize W subject to model 1.1 with the error terms for t = 5, . . . , S set to 
zero. For each value of z a value of W can be computed, which is all an optimization 
algorithm like DFP needs.
If the model is nonlinear or the function gt is not quadratic, the computed value of 
W for a given value of z and zero error terms is not equal to the expected value. The 
optimum, therefore, does not correspond to the expected value of W being maximized 
other than in the linear/quadratic case.
It is possible, however, to compute the expected value of W for a given value of z 
using stochastic simulation. For a given value of z one can compute, say, J values of 
W, where each value is based on a draw of the error terms for periods 5 through S. An 
estimate of the expected value of W is then the average of the J values.
As in the last chapter, let the model be 1.1, let a denote the vector of coefficient 
estimates, and let u denote the vector of estimated residuals. For the purposes of this 
chapter a is taken to be fixed. In other words, the maximization is conditional on the 
model and on the coefficient estimates. The steps for maximizing the expected value 
of W are as follows:
1. Begin with an optimization algorithm like DFP that requires for a given value of z 
a value of the objective function.
2. For a given trial j, draw u J from u with replacement for t = s, . . . , S. For the 
given value of z from the optimization algorithm, use these errors and a to solve 
model 1.1 dynamically for t — 5, ..., S and compute the value of W. Let IT7 denote 
the computed value of W on trial j.
*
3. Repeat step 2 for j = 1, . . . , J.

132
10 || Certainty Equivalence
4. From the J values of W7, compute the mean: W — j W' • Feed back to the 
optimization algorithm W as the value of the objective function for the given value 
of z. Let the optimization algorithm then find the value of z that minimizes W. This 
solution will be called the “truly optimal” solution.
This means that the model is solved J times for periods 5 through 5 for each evaluation 
of the objective function (that is, each value of W). In the CE case there is only one 
solution—the solution using zero errors.
In practice, after the solution is found, z*  would be implemented. Then after period 
5 passes and the values for period 5 are known, the whole process would be repeated 
beginning in period 5 + 1. The main interest for comparison purposes is thus to compare 
z*  to the optimum value that is computed using CE, denoted, say, z**
.
 It is not necessary 
to compare solution values beyond 5 because these are never implemented.

where Y is output (variable Y in the US model) and PF is the rate of inflation 
(percentage change at an annual rate in variable PF in the US model). The super­
script * denotes the actual (historical) value of the variable. Consider the case in which 
the estimated residuals are added to the equations and taken to be exogenous. This 
means that when the model is solved using the actual values of the exogenous variables, 
a perfect tracking solution results—the predicted values are just the actual values. For 
the rest of this chapter it will be assumed that the estimated residuals have been added 
to the equations and taken to be exogenous. If in this case W in equation 10.2 is mini­
mized using CE for some given set of control variables, the optimal z values are just the 
actual z values. The optimal value of W is zero, which occurs when the control values 
equal the actual values.
In the non-CE case steps 2 and 3 in the previous section can be used to compute 
the expected value of W, where in the present setup the drawn errors are added to the 
equations with the estimated residuals already added. For any given value of z, W is, 
of course, not zero because Y and PF are stochastic. The optimization algorithm can 
be used to find the value of z that minimizes W.
The advantage of this setup is that one can compare the CE and non-CE cases by 
simply comparing the “truly optimal” control value to the actual value, since the actual 
value is the solution value in the CE case. One thus needs to compute only the truly 
optimal value.

10.4.2 Results
As noted above, the US model is used for the present results. The control period is 
1994:1-1998:4, which is 20 quarters. The DFP algorithm was used, and the number 
of trials, J, per function evaluation was taken to be 1,000. Two experiments were per­
formed, one using COG, federal government purchases of goods, as the control variable, 
and one using RS, the three-month Treasury bill rate, as the control variable. The es­
timated residuals from which the draws were made were computed using coefficient 
estimates obtained for the 1954:1-2002:3 period (195 observations). There were thus 
195 vectors of estimated residuals to draw from.
For the first experiment the optimal value of COG for the first quarter was 59.1879, 
which compares to the actual value of 59.1500. This difference of 0.06 percent is quite 
small, and so the truly optimal solution is quite close to the CE solution. (Remember that 
the actual value is the optimal value under CE.) The results for the second experiment 
were similar. The optimal value of RS for the first quarter was 3.2681, which compares 
to the actual value of 3.2500. These results thus suggest that there is little loss from 
using CE for models like 1.1. This is, of course, encouraging regarding computer time. 
Each experiment took about 6.5 hours on a 1.7 Ghz PC, whereas in the CE case the 
time would be about one one-thousandth of this.
The value of W at the optimum was 0.0100 for the first experiment and 0.0117 for the 
second. To get a sense of magnitudes, if the absolute value of (T — Y*)/Y
*
 were 0.016 
per quarter and the absolute value of PF — PF
*
 were also 0.016 per quarter, the value 
of W would be 0.0102 (= 20 x 2 x 0.0162). The average quarterly deviation (brought 
about by the stochastic simulation) is thus fairly large—on the order of 1.6 percent. 
What the present results show is that even though this deviation is fairly large, little is 
lost by ignoring it and using CE when solving optimal control problems.

Evaluating Policy Rules
11.1 Introduction
This chapter examines various interest rate rules, as well as policies derived by solving 
optimal control problems, for their ability to dampen economic fluctuations caused 
by random shocks.1 A tax rate rule is also considered. The MC and US models are 
used for the experiments. The results differ sharply from those obtained using modern­
view models that were discussed in Chapter 7, where the coefficient on inflation in the 
nominal interest rate rule must be greater than one in order for the economy to be stable.
1. The results in this chapter are the same as those in Fair (2004b).
2. Federal Reserve Board (2000).
Section 11.2 discusses a simple experiment in which the interest rate rule of the Fed 
(equation 30) is dropped from the model and RS is decreased by one percentage point. 
It will be seen that although there are substantial real output effects from this change, 
the effects are much smaller than those in the FRB/US model,1 2 which is a modern-view 
model.
Section 11.3 examines the stabilization features of four interest rate rules for the 
United States. The first is simply the estimated rule, equation 30, which has an esti­
mated long-run coefficient on inflation of approximately one. The other three rules are 
modifications of the estimated rule, with imposed long-run coefficients on inflation of 
0.0, 1.5, and 2.5 respectively. It will be seen that as the inflation coefficient increases 
there is a reduction in price variability at a cost of an increase in interest rate variability. 
Even the rule with a zero inflation coefficient is stabilizing, which is contrary to what 
would be obtained using modern-view models.
Section 11.4 then computes optimal rules for particular loss functions. These solu­
tions require a combination of stochastic simulation and solving deterministic optimal 
control problems, and this is the first time that such solutions have been obtained for a 
large-scale model. It will be seen that the optimal control results are similar to those ob­

tained using the estimated rule mentioned above for a loss function with a much higher 
weight on inflation than on output.
Another feature of the results in Sections 11.3 and 11.4 is that considerable variance 
of the endogenous variables is left, even using the best interest rate rule. Section 11.5 
then adds a fiscal policy rule—a tax rate rule—to see how much help it can be to 
monetary policy in trying to stabilize the economy. The results show that the tax rate 
rule provides some help. This is also the first time that such a rule has been analyzed 
using a large-scale model.
11.2 The Effects of a Decrease in RS
It will first be useful to review the effects of a change in the U.S. short-term interest 
rate, RS, in the MC model. To examine these effects, the following experiment was run. 
The period used is 1994:1-1998:4, 20 quarters. As in the experiments in Chapters 6-8, 
the first step is to add the estimated residuals to the stochastic equations and take them 
to be exogenous. This means that when the model is solved using the actual values 
of all the exogenous variables, a perfect tracking solution results. The base path for 
the experiment is thus just the historical path. Then the estimated interest rate rule 
for the Fed, equation 30, was dropped from the model, and RS was decreased by one 
percentage point from its historical value for each quarter. The model was then solved. 
The difference between the predicted value of each variable and each period from this 
solution and its base (actual) value is the estimated effect of the interest rate change.
Selected results from this experiment are presented in Table 11.1. Row 3 shows that 
real output, Y, increases: the nominal interest rate decrease is expansionary. The peak 
response is 0.55 percent after 12 quarters. Row 1 shows the exogenous fall in RS of 
one percentage point, and row 2 shows the response of the long-term bond rate, RB, 
to this change. After 12 quarters the bond rate has fallen 0.79 percentage points. This 
reflects the properties of the estimated term structure equation 22, where RB responds 
to current and past values of RS. The unemployment rate is lower (row 4), and the price 
level is higher (row 5). The peak unemployment response is —0.23 percentage points 
after 8 quarters.
The change in nominal after-tax corporate profits (row 6) is higher because of the 
higher level of real output and higher price level. The nominal value of household 
capital gains, CG, is larger because of the lower bond rate and higher value of profits 
(equation 25). An increase in CG is an increase in nominal household wealth, and row 8 
shows that real wealth, AA, also increases initially. By quarter 16, however, real wealth 
is slightly below the base value. This means that by quarter 16 the negative effect on 
real wealth from the higher price level has offset the positive effect from the higher 
nominal wealth.
Rows 9 and 10 show that although nominal disposal personal income, YD, increases, 
real disposal personal income, YD/PH, decreases. An important feature of the model is 
that when interest rates fall, interest payments of the firm and government sectors fall, 
and this in turn lowers interest income of the household sector. A decrease in household

interest income is a decrease in YD. The household sector is a large creditor, and this 
interest income effect is fairly large. The increase in YD is thus less than it otherwise 
would be, and row 10 shows that the net effect on real disposable personal income is 
negative. Another factor contributing to the fall in real disposable personal income is 
that there is a slight fall in the real wage (not shown). Wages lag prices in the model, 
and the initial response is for the nominal wage rate to increase less than the price 
level.
Rows 11-14 show that real household expenditures are larger except for a small 
initial decrease in IHH and a decrease in CD in quarter 20. The two positive effects 
on expenditures are the lower interest rates (a nominal interest rate is an explanatory 
variable in each of the household expenditure equations) and the higher real wealth. 
The negative effect is the fall in real disposable personal income. There is an additional 

11.2 || The Effects of a Decrease in RS
137
negative effect on durable expenditures and residential investment over time, which is 
an increase in the stocks of durables and housing. Other things being equal, an increase 
in the stock of durables has a negative effect on durable expenditures and an increase 
in the stock of housing has a negative effect on residential investment. Row 15 shows 
that real plant and equipment investment, IKF, rises. This is because of the fall in the 
real bond rate and the rise in real output.
Rows 16-24 pertain to the effect of the rest of the world on the United States and 
vice versa. Rows 16 and 17 show that the Japanese and German interest rates, RSJA 
and RSge, both decrease. These are the estimated interest rate rules for Japan and 
Germany at work. The US interest rate is an explanatory variable in each of these 
equations. This means that the Japanese and German monetary authorities are estimated 
to respond directly to U.S. monetary policy. Rows 18 and 19 show that the yen and the 
DM appreciate relative to the dollar. (Remember that a decrease in E is an appreciation 
of the currency.) This is because there is a fall in the U.S. interest rate relative to the 
Japanese and German interest rates and because there is an increase in the U.S. price 
level relative to the Japanese and German price levels (not shown).
The depreciation of the dollar leads to an increase in the U.S. import price level, 
PIM (row 20). This increase is one of the reasons for the increase in the U.S. price 
level (row 5), since the price of imports has a positive effect on the domestic price 
level in U.S. price equation 10. Even though the price of imports rises relative to 
the domestic price level, which other things being equal has a negative effect on 
import demand, the real value of imports, IM, rises (row 21). In this case the posi­
tive effect from the increase in real output dominates the negative relative price ef­
fect.
The rise in the overall U.S. price level leads to a rise in the U.S. export price level, 
PEX (row 22). The real value of U.S. exports, EX, rises (row 23), which is due to the 
depreciation of the dollar. (The U.S. export price level increases less than the dollar 
depreciates, and so U.S. export prices in other countries’ currencies fall.)
Finally, the nominal U.S. current account falls (row 24). The positive effects on the 
current account are the increase in real exports and the increase in the price of exports. 
The negative effects are the increase in real imports and the increase in the price of 
imports. On net the negative effects win, which is primarily due to the increase in the 
price of imports.
The real output effects of 0.33 percent after four quarters and 0.52 percent after 
eight quarters are much lower than in the FRB/US model, where the effects are 0.6 
percent after four quarters and 1.7 percent after eight quarters—Reifschneider, Tetlow, 
and Williams (1999), table 3. The effects are even larger after that, and the model 
eventually blows up if the short-term nominal interest rate is held below its base value.3 
As discussed in Chapter 7, this is a modern-view feature, where the model is unstable 
without an inflation coefficient in the interest rate rule greater than one. In this kind 
of model an experiment in which the interest rate rule is dropped and the interest rate 
lowered is explosive.

11.3 Stabilization Effectiveness of Four Rules
11.3.1 The Four Rules
In the estimated interest rate rule for the Fed, equation 30, the coefficient on lagged 
money growth is 0.011, the coefficient on inflation is 0.080, and the coefficient on the 
lagged dependent variable is 0.909 (Table A30 within Table A.4 in Appendix A). If it 
is assumed that in the long run money growth equals the rate of inflation, then the long 
run-coefficient on inflation in equation 30 is 1.0 [= (0.080 + 0.011)/(1 — 0.909)]. As 
noted in section 11.1, the other three rules have imposed long-run coefficients of 0.0, 
1.5, and 2.5, respectively. This was done for each rule by changing the coefficient for 
the rate of inflation in equation 30. The respective coefficients are —0.011,0.1255, and 
0.2165. None of the other coefficients in the estimated equation were changed for the 
three rules.4 This process is similar to that followed for the studies in Taylor (1999a), 
where the five main rules tried had inflation coefficients varying from 1.2 to 3.0. No 
inflation coefficient less than 1.0 was tried in these studies because the models, which 
are modern-view models, are not stable in this case.
4. Note 5 in this chapter explains why the constant term in the interest rate rule does not have to be 
changed when the inflation coefficient is changed.
5. For the few equations whose estimation periods began later than 1976, zero residuals were used for 
the missing observations.
11.3.2 The Stochastic-Simulation Procedure
The four interest rate rules are examined using stochastic simulation. For all the work 
in this chapter the coefficient estimates have been taken to be fixed. The results are 
conditional on the model and on the coefficient estimates. The focus in this chapter, 
as in much of the literature, is on variances, not means. The aim of monetary policy is 
taken to smooth the effects of shocks. In order to examine the ability of monetary policy 
to do this, one needs an estimate of the likely shocks that monetary policy would need to 
smooth, and this can be done by means of stochastic simulation. Given an econometric 
model, shocks can be generated by drawing errors.
In Chapter 9 stochastic simulation was used only for the US model. In this chapter the 
entire MC model is used except for the optimal control work. There are 362 stochastic 
equations in the MC model, 191 quarterly and 171 annual. There is an estimated residual 
for each of these equations for each period. Although the equations do not all have the 
same estimation period, the period 1976-1998 is common to almost all equations.5 
There are thus available 23 vectors of annual estimated residuals and 92 vectors of 
quarterly estimated residuals. These vectors are taken as estimates of the economic 
shocks, and they are drawn in the manner discussed below. Since these vectors are 
vectors of the historical shocks, they pick up the historical correlations of the error 
terms. If, for example, shocks in two consumption equations are highly positively 
correlated, the error terms in the two equations will tend to be high together or low 
together.

11.3 || Stabilization Effectiveness of Four Rules
139
The period used for the stabilization experiments is 1994:1-1998:4, five years or 
20 quarters. Since the concern here is with stabilization around base paths and not with 
positions of the base paths themselves, it does not matter much which path is chosen 
for the base path. The choice here is simply to take as the base path the historical path. 
The base path is generated by adding the estimated residuals to the stochastic equations 
and taking them to be exogenous. In other words, for all the stochastic simulations in 
this chapter the estimated residuals are added to the model and the draws are around 
these residuals.
Each trial for the stochastic simulation is a dynamic deterministic simulation for 
1994:1-1998:4 using a particular draw of the error terms. For each of the five years 
for a given trial an integer is drawn between 1 and 23 with probability 1/23 for each 
integer. This draw determines which of the 23 vectors of annual error terms is used for 
that year. The four vectors of quarterly error terms used are the four that correspond to 
that year. Each trial is thus based on drawing five integers, one for each of the five years. 
The solution of the model for this trial is an estimate of what the world economy would 
have been like had the particular drawn error terms actually occurred. (Remember that 
the drawn error terms are on top of the estimated residuals for 1994:1-1998:4, which 
are always added to the equations.) The number of trials taken is 1,000, so 1,000 world 
economic outcomes for 1994:1-1998:4 are available for analysis.
The estimated residuals are added to the interest rate rule, but no errors are drawn 
for it. Adding the estimated residuals means that when the model inclusive of the rule is 
solved with no errors for any equation drawn, a perfect tracking solution results.6 Not 
drawing errors for the rule means that the Fed does not behave randomly but simply 
follows the rule.
6. Each of the four rules has a different set of estimated residuals associated with it, because the predicted 
values from the rules differ due to the different inflation coefficients. This is why the constant term does 
not have to be changed in the rule when the inflation coefficient is changed. The estimated residuals are 
changed instead.
7. If y* were the estimated mean of yit, this measure would be the estimated variance of yit. Given the 
J values of y-t, the estimated mean of yit is (1/ J) 
yJit, and for a nonlinear model it is not the case that
this mean equals y* even as J goes to infinity. As an empirical matter, however, the difference in these two 
values is quite small for almost all macroeconometric models, and so it is approximately the case that the 
above measure of variability is the estimated variance.
Let yJit be the predicted value of endogenous variable i for quarter t on trial j, and let 
y*  be the base (actual) value. How best to summarize the 1,000 x 20 values of y7f? One 
possibility for a variability measure is to compute the variability of y!f around y*  for 
each t: (1/ J) ^2y=1(y/f — y* t )2, where J is the total number of trials.7 The problem with 
this measure, however, is that there are 20 values per variable, which makes summary 
difficult. A more useful measure is the following. Let L[ be:
Li = ^iSy’t-y
*y,
 
(II.I) 

140
11 || Evaluating Policy Rules
where T is the length of the simulation period (T = 20 in the present case). Then the 
measure is
1 J •
^ = 7EC 
(11.2)
,/=l
L, is a measure of the deviation of variable i from its base values over the whole period.8
8. Lj is, of course, not an estimated variance. Aside from the fact that for a nonlinear model the mean 
of yjt is not y*, Ll is an average across a number of quarters or years, and variances are not, in general, 
constant across time. L, is just a summary measure of variability.
11.3.3 The Results
The results for this section are presented in the first five rows in Table 11.2. The first 
row (“No rule”) treats RS as exogenous. This means that the value of RS in a given 
quarter is the historic value for all the trials: RS does not respond to the shocks. Values 
of Lz are presented for real output, Y; the level of the private nonfarm price deflator, 
PF; the percentage change in PF, PF; and RS. The following discussion will focus on 
Y, PF, and RS. The results for PF are generally similar to those for PF, although the 
differences in Lz across rules are larger for PF than for PF. All the experiments for the 
MC model use the same error draws, that is, the same sequence of random numbers. 
This considerably lessens stochastic simulation error across experiments.
The results in Table 11.2 are easy to summarize. Consider row 1 versus row 3. Lz for 
Y falls from 2.75 for the no rule case to 2.31 for the estimated rule, and Lz for PF falls 
from 3.07 to 2.40. Both output and price variability are thus lowered considerably by 
the estimated rule. Now consider rows 2 through 5. As the long-run inflation coefficient 
increases from 0.0 to 2.5, the variability of PF falls, the variability of RS rises, and the 
variability of Y is little affected. The cost of lowering PF variability is thus an increase 
in RS variability, not an increase in Y variability. Which rule one thinks is best depends 
on the weights one attaches to PF and RS variability.
How do these results compare with those in the literature? Probably the largest 
difference concerns row 2, where the variability in row 2 is less than the variability 
in row 1. This shows that even the rule with a long-run inflation coefficient of zero 
lowers variability. In modern-view models the rule in row 2 would be destabilizing. 
Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2000) have a clear discussion of this. They conclude that the 
rule used by the Fed in the pre-1979 period probably had an inflation coefficient less 
than one (p. 177), and they leave as an open question why the Fed followed a rule that 
was “clearly inferior” (p. 178) during this period. The results in Table 11.2 suggest that 
such a rule is not necessarily bad.
Results regarding the trade-off between output variability and price variability as 
coefficients in a rule change appear to be quite dependent on the model used. This is 
evident in tables 2 and 3 in Taylor (1999b), and McCallum and Nelson (1999, p. 43) 
point out that increasing the inflation or output coefficient in their rule leads to a trade­
off in one of their models but a reduction in both output and price variability in another.

In Table 11.2 the trade-off is between price variability and interest rate variability as 
the inflation coefficient is increased. There is little trade-off between output and price 
variability. Because the trade-offs are so model specific, one must have confidence in 
the model used to have confidence in the trade-off results. The results in Table 11.2 
convey useful information if the MC model is a good approximation of the economy.
11.4 Optimal Control
11.4.1 The US(EX,PIM) Model
The optimal control procedure discussed in this section is too costly in terms of 
computer time to be able to be used for the entire MC model, and for the work in 
this section a slightly expanded version of the US model has been used, denoted the 
“US(EX,PIM) model.” The expansion relates to U.S. exports, EX, and the U.S. price of 
imports, PIM. These two variables change when RS changes—primarily because the 
value of the dollar changes—and the effects of RS on EX and PIM were approximated 
in the following way.
First, for given values of a1 and a2, log EXt — a\RSt was regressed on the constant 
term, t, logEXr_|, logEXr_2, logEX^, and log£'Xr_4, and log PIMt — a2RSt was 

142
11 || Evaluating Policy Rules
regressed on the constant term, t, log PIMt_\, log PIMt_2, log PIMt_3, and log PIMt_^. 
Second, these two equations were added to the US model, and an experiment was run 
in which equation 30 was dropped and RS was decreased by one percentage point. 
This was done for different values of and a2. The final values of and a2 chosen 
were ones whose experimental results most closely matched the results for the same 
experiment using the complete MC model. The final values chosen were —0.0004 and 
—0.0007, respectively. Third, the experiment in the third row of Table 11.2 was run for 
the US model with the EX and PIM equations added and with the estimated residuals 
from these equations being used for the drawing of the errors. When an error for the EX 
equation was drawn, it was multiplied by and when an error for the PIM equation 
was drawn, it was multiplied by /32. The experiment was run for different values of 
/3{ and /32, and the final values chosen were ones that led to results similar to those in 
the third row of Table 11.2. The values were — 0.4 and fl2 — 0-75. The results using 
these values are in row 8 of Table 11.2. The chosen values of aj, a2, and ft2 were 
then used for the experiments in rows 9-11.
The US(EX,PIM) model is thus a version of the US model in which EX and PIM 
have been made endogenous with respect to their reactions to changes in RS. It is an 
attempt to approximate the overall MC model in this regard.
11.4.2 The Procedure
Much of the literature on examining rules has not been concerned with deriving rules 
by solving optimal control problems,9 but optimal control techniques are obvious ones 
to use in this context. The following procedure has been applied to the US(EX,PIM) 
model.
9. Exceptions are Feldstein and Stock (1993), Fair and Howrey (1996), and Rudebusch (1999).
The estimated residuals for the 1976:1-1998:4 period (92 quarters) were used for 
the draws. Each vector of quarterly residuals had a probability of 1/92 of being drawn. 
Not counting the estimated interest rate rule, there are 29 estimated equations in the 
US(EX,PIM) model plus the EX and PIM equations discussed above.
The optimal control methodology requires that a loss function be postulated for the 
Fed. In the loss function used here the Fed is assumed to care about output, inflation, 
and interest rate fluctuations. In particular, the loss for quarter t is assumed to be:
h, = xpoour, - r,*)/r,
*]
2 + x2ioo(pf, - pf*?  + aitsRS, - 
3)
+ 1.0/(RS, - 0.999) + 1.0/(16.001 - RS,), 
'
where * denotes a base value. A] is the weight on output deviations, and A2 is the 
weight on inflation deviations. The last two terms in equation 11.3 ensure that the 
optimal values of RS will be between 1.0 and 16.0. The value of a was chosen by 
experimentation to yield an optimal solution, with a value of Li for RS in Table 11.2 
about the same as the value that results when the estimated rule is used. The value 
chosen was 9.0. The base values in equation 11.3 are the actual (historical) values. The 
base path for each variable is the actual path (since the estimated residuals have been 

11.4 || Optimal Control
143
added to the equations), and so the losses in equation 11.3 are deviations from the actual 
values.
Assume that the control period of interest is 1 through T, where in the present case 
1 is 1994:1 and T is 1998:4. Although this is the control period of interest, in order not 
to have to assume that life ends in T, the control problem should be thought of as one 
of minimizing the expected value of Ht, where n is chosen to be large enough to 
avoid unusual end-of-horizon effects near T. The overall control problem should thus 
be thought of as choosing values of RS that minimize the expected value of Ht 
subject to the model used.
If the model used is linear and the loss function quadratic, it is possible to derive 
analytically optimal feedback equations for the control variables.10 11
 In general, however, 
optimal feedback equations cannot be derived for nonlinear models or for loss functions 
with nonlinear constraints on the instruments, and a numerical procedure like the one 
outlined in section 1.7 must be used. The following procedure was used for the results 
in this section. It is based on a sequence of solutions of deterministic control problems, 
one sequence per trial, where certainty equivalence (CE) is used.
10. See, for example, Chow (1981).
11. The main exogenous variables in the US(EX,P1M) model are fiscal policy variables. Remember that 
since the base is the perfect tracking solution, the estimated residuals are always added to the stochastic 
equations and treated as exogenous. The error draws are on top of these residuals.
12. Almost all the computer time for the overall procedure in this section is spent solving these 
optimization problems. The total computer time taken to solve the 2,000 optimization problems was about 
three hours on a computer with a 1.7 GHz Pentium chip.
Recall what a trial for the stochastic simulation is. A trial is a set of draws of 
20 vectors of error terms, one vector per quarter. Given this set, the model is solved 
dynamically for the 20 quarters using an interest rate rule (or no rule). This entire 
procedure is then repeated 100 times (the chosen number of trials), at which time the 
summary statistics are computed. As will now be discussed, each trial for the optimal 
control procedure requires that 20 deterministic control problems be solved, and so 
with 100 trials, 2,000 optimal control problems have to be solved.
For purposes of solving the control problems, the Fed is assumed to know the model 
(its structure and coefficient estimates) and the exogenous variables, both past and 
future. The Fed is assumed not to know the future values of any endogenous variable 
or any error draw when solving the control problems.11 The Fed is assumed to know 
the error draws for the first quarter for each solution. This is consistent with the use of 
the above rules, where the error draws for the quarter are used when solving the model 
with the rule.
The procedure for solving the overall control problem is as follows.
1. Draw a vector of errors for quarter 1, and add these errors to the equations. Take the 
errors for quarters 2 through k to be zero (that is, no draws, but remember that the 
estimated residuals are always added), where k is defined shortly. Choose values 
of RS for quarters 1 through k that minimize Ht subject to the model as just 
described. This is just a deterministic optimal control problem, which can be solved, 
for example, by the procedure outlined in section 1.7.  Let denote the optimal 
12

value of RS for quarter 1 that results from this solution. The value of k should be 
chosen to be large enough so that making it larger has a negligible effect on RS
**
.
 
(This value can be chosen ahead of time by experimentation.) RS
**
 is computed 
at the beginning of quarter 1 under the assumptions that (1) the model is known, 
(2) the exogenous variable values are known, and (3) the error draws for quarter 1 
are known.
13. The optimal control procedure just outlined differs from the procedure used in Fair and Howrey 
(1996, pp. 178-179). In Fair and Howrey (1996) the Fed is assumed not to know the exogenous variable 
values, but instead to use estimated autoregressive equations to predict these values for the current and 
future quarters. Also, the estimated residuals are not added to the equations, and no stochastic simulation is 
done. Instead, one optimal control problem is solved, where the target values are the historical means and 
the solution uses for the error draws for a given quarter the estimated residuals for that quarter. The Fed is 
assumed not to know the error draw for the current quarter.
2. Record the solution values from the model for quarter 1 using RS  and the error 
draws. These solution values are what the model estimates would have occurred in 
quarter 1 had the Fed chosen and had the error terms been as drawn.
**
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the control problem beginning in quarter 2, then for the 
control problem beginning in quarter 3, and so on through the control problem 
beginning in quarter T. For an arbitrary beginning quarter s, use the solution values 
of all endogenous variables for quarters 5 — 1 and back, as well as the values of 
RS
^
 and back.
*
4. Steps 1 through 3 constitute one trial, that is, one set of T drawn vectors of errors. 
Do these steps again for another set of T drawn vectors. Keep doing this until the 
specified number of trials has been completed.
The solution values of the endogenous variables carried along for a given trial from 
quarter to quarter in the above procedure are estimates of what the economy would have 
been like had the Fed chosen RS
**
,
 ..., RS
**
 and the error terms been as drawn.13
By “optimal rule” in this chapter is meant the entire procedure just discussed. There 
is obviously no analytic rule computed, just a numerical value of RS
**
 for each period.
11.4.3 The Results
The results are presented in rows 7-11 in Table 11.2. The experiments in these rows 
use the same error draws, that is, the same sequence of random numbers, to lessen 
stochastic simulation error across experiments, although these error draws are different 
from those used for the experiments in rows 1-6. Rows 7 and 8 are equivalent to rows 1 
and 3: no rule and estimated rule, respectively. The same pattern holds for both the MC 
model and the US model results, namely that the estimated rule substantially lowers 
the variability of both Y and PF.
Row 9 presents the results for the optimal solution with equal weights (that is, 
X] — 0.5 and a2 — 0.5) on output and inflation in the loss function. Rows 7 and 9 show 
that the optimal control procedure lowered the variability of Y substantially and had 

11.5 || Adding a Tax Rate Rule
145
little effect on the variability of PF. This is quite different from the estimated rule 
(row 8). The estimated rule lowered the variability of both Y and PF, although the fall 
in the variability of Y was much less than it was for the optimal control procedure.
For rows 10 and 11 the weight on inflation in the loss function is increased. This, 
not surprisingly, increases the variability of Y and lowers the variability of PF. Row 11, 
which has a weight of 2.5 on inflation, gives similar results to those in row 8, which uses 
the estimated rule. In this sense the estimated rule is consistent with the Fed minimizing 
the loss function with weights X! = 0.5 and A2 = 2.5 in equation 11.3.
Again, how do these results compare to those in the literature? A common result in 
the Taylor (1999a) volume is that simple rules perform nearly as well as optimal rules 
or more complicated rules. See Taylor (1999b, p. 10), Rotemberg and Woodford (1999, 
p. 109), Rudebusch and Svensson (1999, p. 238), and Levin, Wieland, and Williams 
(1999, p. 294). The results in rows 8 and 11 are consistent with this theme, where the 
estimated rule performs nearly as well as the optimal control procedure. The optimal 
control procedure in this case is one in which the Fed puts a considerably higher weight 
on inflation than on output in the loss function.
11.5 
Adding a Tax Rate Rule
It is clear from the results in Table 11.2 that considerable overall variability is left in 
rows 2-5. In this section a tax rate rule is analyzed to see how much help it can be to 
monetary policy in stabilizing the economy. The idea is that a particular tax rate or set 
of rates would be automatically adjusted each quarter as a function of the state of the 
economy. Congress would vote on the parameters of the tax rate rule as it was voting 
on the general budget plan, and the tax rate or set of rates would then become an added 
automatic stabilizer.
Consider, for example, the federal gasoline tax rate. If the short-run demand for 
gasoline is fairly price inelastic, a change in the after-tax price at the pump will have 
only a small effect on the number of gallons purchased. In this case a change in the 
gasoline tax rate is like a change in after-tax income. Another possibility would be a 
national sales tax if such a tax existed. If the sales tax were broad enough, a change in 
the sales tax rate would also be like a change in after-tax income.
For the results in this section D3G is used as the tax rate for the tax rate rule. It 
is the constructed federal indirect business tax rate in the US model—see Tables A.2 
and A.7. In practice a specific tax rate or rates, such as the gasoline tax rate, would have 
to be used, and this would be decided by the political process. In the regular version of 
the US model D3G is exogenous.
The following equation is used for the tax rate rule:

where, as before, * denotes a base value. It is not realistic to have tax rates respond 
contemporaneously to the economy, and so lags have been used in equation 11.4. Lags

11 || Evaluating Policy Rules
of both one and two quarters have been used to smooth tax rate changes somewhat. The 
rule says that the tax rate exceeds its base value as output and the inflation rate exceed 
their base values. Note that unlike the basic interest rate rule, equation 30, the rule 11.4 
has not been estimated. It would not make sense to try to estimate such a rule, since it 
is clear that the government has never followed a tax rule policy.
Results using this rule along with the estimated interest rate rule are reported in 
row 6 in Table 11.2. (The overall MC model is used for these calculations, not the 
US(EX,PIM) model.) The use of the rule lowers L, for Y from 2.31 when only the 
estimated interest rate rule is used to 2.01 when both rules are used. The respective 
numbers for PF are 2.40 and 2.28. The tax rate rule is thus of some help in lowering 
output and price variability, with a little more effect on output variability than on price 
variability. The variability of RS falls slightly when the tax rate rule is added, since 
there is less for monetary policy to do when fiscal policy is helping.
11.6 
Conclusion
The main conclusions about monetary policy from the results in Table 11.2 are the 
following:
1. The estimated rule explaining Fed behavior, equation 30, substantially reduces 
output and price variability (row 3 versus row 1).
2. Variability is reduced even when the long-run coefficient on inflation in the interest 
rate rule is set to zero (row 2 versus row 1). This is contrary to what would be the 
case in modern-view models, where such a rule would be destabilizing.
3. Increasing the long-run coefficient on inflation in the interest rate rule lowers price 
variability, but it comes at a cost of increased interest rate variability (for example, 
row 5 versus row 3).
4. A tax rate rule is a noticeable help to monetary policy in its stabilization effort (row 
6 versus row 3).
5. The optimal control procedure with Aj — 0.5 and a2 — 2.5, which means a higher 
weight on inflation than on output in the loss function, gives results that are similar 
to the use of the estimated rule (row 11 versus row 8). The fact that the estimated 
rule does about as well as the optimal control procedure is consistent with many 
results in the literature, where simple rules tend to do fairly well.
6. Even when both the estimated interest rate rule and the tax rate rule are used, the 
values of L; in Table 11.2 are not close to zero (row 6). Monetary policy even with 
the help of a fiscal policy rule does not come close to eliminating the effects of 
typical historical shocks.

12.1 
Introduction
When different countries adopt a common currency, each gives up its own monetary 
policy.1 In the common-currency regime, monetary policy responds to a shock in a par­
ticular country only to the extent that the common monetary authority responds to the 
shock. If this response is less than the response that the country’s own monetary au­
thority would have made in the pre-common-currency regime, there are stabilization 
costs of moving to a common currency. This chapter uses the MC model and stochastic 
simulation to estimate the stabilization costs to Germany, France, Italy, and the Nether­
lands from having joined the European Monetary Union (EMU). Costs to the United 
Kingdom from joining are also estimated. Variability estimates are computed for the 
non-EMU and EMU regimes.1 2 The results show that Germany is hurt the most in terms 
of stabilization costs from joining the EMU.
1. The results in this chapter are updates of those in Fair (1998).
2. For other results using stochastic simulation to examine the EMU, see Hallett, Minford, and Ras- 
togi (1993), Masson and Symansky (1992), and Masson and Turtelboom (1997).
The question that this chapter attempts to answer is a huge one, and the results 
should be interpreted with considerable caution. In order to answer this question one 
needs (1) an estimate of how the world economy operates in the non-EMU regime, 
(2) an estimate of how it operates in the EMU regime, and (3) an estimate of the likely 
shocks to the world economy. Each of these estimates in this chapter is obviously only 
an approximation.
Prior to the beginning of the EMU in 1999, there was a large literature analyzing the 
economic consequences of a common European currency. Wyplosz (1997) provides a 
useful review. Much of this literature is in the Mundell (1961), McKinnon (1963), and 
Kenen (1969) framework and asks whether Europe meets the standards for an optimum 
currency area. The questions asked include how open the countries are, how correlated 
individual shocks are across countries, and the degree of labor mobility. There was 
also work examining real exchange rate variances. The smaller are these variances,
147

148
12 || EMU Stabilization Costs
the smaller are the likely costs of moving to a common currency. Von Hagen and 
Neumann (1994) compared variances of price levels within West German regions with 
variances of real exchange rates between the regions and other European countries.
The MC model contains estimates of how open countries are, in that there are esti­
mated import demand equations and estimated trade-share equations in the model. The 
model also contains estimates of the correlation of individual shocks across countries 
through the estimated residuals in the individual stochastic equations. Real exchange 
rates are endogenous because there are estimated equations for nominal exchange rates 
and individual country price levels. The MC model thus has imbedded in it estimates 
of a number of the features of the world economy that are needed to analyze optimum­
currency-area questions. The degree of labor mobility among countries, however, is not 
estimated: the specification of the model is based on the assumption of no labor mobility 
among countries. To the extent that there is labor mobility, the present stabilization-cost 
estimates are likely to be too high.
A key feature of the MC model for present purposes is that there are estimated 
monetary-policy rules for each of the European countries prior to 1999:1. These are the 
estimated interest rate rules—equation 7 for a given country in the ROW model. In the 
EMU regime these rules for the joining European countries are replaced with one rule— 
one interest rate rule for the EMU. There are also estimated exchange rate equations 
for each of the European countries in the model—equation 9 for a given country in the 
ROW model. In the EMU regime these equations for the joining European countries are 
replaced with one equation—the exchange rate equation for the euro. Finally, there are 
estimated term structure equations for each of the European countries—equation 8 for 
a given country in the ROW model. In the EMU regime these equations for the joining 
European countries are replaced with one term structure equation.
To get a sense of interest rate effects in the model, it may be useful to review the 
discussion at the end of Chapter 2 and the experiment in Chapter 8 where the German 
interest rate was decreased.
12.2 
The Stochastic-Simulation Procedure
The procedure used here is the same as the one used in section 11.3.2. The simulation 
period is the same (1994:1-1998:4), and the period for the estimated residuals is the 
same (1976-1998). The number of trials is 1,000, and the values of L; are computed 
as in equation 11.2. Again, the coefficient estimates are taken as fixed for purposes of 
the stochastic simulations.
There are 16 European countries in the model, eight quarterly and eight annual. The 
first experiment pertains to four of these: Germany, France, Italy, and the Netherlands. 
For the second experiment the United Kingdom is added.
12.3 
Results for the non-EMU Regime
Since the simulation period considered in this chapter is before 1999:1, the non­
EMU regime is simply the actual regime. Results for this experiment are presented

as experiments 1 and 2 in Table 12.1. Values of L, are presented for six countries, GE, 
FR, IT, NE, UK, and US, and for three variables, real GDP, Y, the GDP deflator, PY, 
and the short-term interest rate, RS. (For the United States, Y is real output of the firm 
sector and PF is the price deflator.)
Even though results for only six countries are presented in Table 12.1, the entire 
MC model is used for the experiments. The same draws (that is, the same sequence 
of random numbers) were used for each experiment in order to lessen stochastic­
simulation error for the comparisons between experiments. The one difference between 
the experiments here and the experiments for the MC model in Table 11.2 is that for 
each of the six countries, drawn errors are not used for the interest rate rule, the term 
structure equation, or the exchange rate equation. Since moving from the current regime 
to the EMU regime requires changing these equations for the European countries, it 
seemed best for comparison purposes not to complicate matters by having to make 
assumptions about what errors to use in the EMU regime for these equations. The 
variability estimates are thus based on all types of shocks except financial ones. This 
difference pertains only to the six countries; for all the other countries the error draws 
are as in Chapter 11 ?
For the first experiment the estimated interest rate rules for the five European 
countries are dropped from the model (but not the US interest rate rule), and the five 
short-term interest rates are taken to be exogenous. This is not meant to be a realistic 
case, but merely to serve as a baseline for comparison. The results are in the first column 
for each variable in Table 12.1. The second experiment differs from the first in that the
3. In Chapter 11 errors were not drawn for equation 30 for the United States, and this is true here as 
well. Errors were drawn for the US term structure equations 23 and 24, but in this chapter errors are not 
drawn for these two equations (thus treating the United States like the other five countries). 

150
12 || EMU Stabilization Costs
five interest rate rules are added back in. Otherwise, everything else is the same. The 
results are presented in the second column for each variable.
Comparing columns 1 and 2 for output shows how stabilizing the estimated interest 
rate rules are. For Germany Lt falls from 5.09 to 2.29, and so the German interest 
rate rule is quite stabilizing. L, also falls for Italy, the Netherlands, and the United 
Kingdom. However, it rises for France. The estimated interest rate rule for France (see 
Table B7) does not have an output variable, and the inflation variable is not significant. 
According to the estimated rule, the Bank of France responds mostly to the German 
and U.S. interest rates. The rule is thus not likely to be stabilizing, which the results in 
Table 12.1 show is the case.
The variability for the price level also falls in Table 12.1 from column 1 to 2 for 
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, but not for France. Note for 
France that the variability of RS does not rise much from column 1 to 2, which shows 
that the Bank of France is not doing much in response to the shocks.
12.4 
Results for the EMU Regime
The actual EMU regime began in 1999:1, and this regime is part of the MC model from 
1999:1 on. For present purposes, however, an EMU regime needs to be constructed 
that is comparable to the non-EMU regime regarding shocks. For the results in this 
section the same error draws are used as were used for the results in columns 1 and 2 in 
Table 12.1. Given these shocks, the question is how stabilization is affected by moving 
to a common monetary policy.
A hypothetical EMU regime must thus be created for the 1994:1-1998:4 period. In 
fact two EMU regimes are considered here, one including Germany, France, Italy, and 
the Netherlands, and the other including these four countries plus the United Kingdom. 
Three changes are required to do this. Consider first the regime without the United 
Kingdom.
First, the interest rate rules for France, Italy, and the Netherlands were dropped, and 
their short-term interest rates were assumed to move one for one with the German rate. 
The output gap variable that is included in the estimated German rule is the German 
output gap, and this variable was replaced by the total output gap of the four countries. 
In addition, the German inflation variable was replaced by a total inflation variable for 
the four countries.4 The coefficient estimates in this equation were not changed, and 
the U.S. interest rate, which is an explanatory variable in the equation, was retained.
4. For a given country & and period t, let Ykt be its real output, PYkt its domestic price level, and hkt its 
exchange rate vis-a-vis the DM. Also, let hk95 be its exchange rate in 1995, the base year for real output. 
Then total nominal output for the four countries combined, denominated in DM, is 'Y^k=x(PYktYkt)/hkt, 
and total real output, denominated in 1995 DM, is Ykt/hk95. The price level for the four countries 
combined is the ratio of total nominal output to total real output. The total inflation variable is the percentage 
change in the price level for the four countries combined. Total potential output, denominated in 1995 DM, 
is ^4k=l YSkl/hk95, where YSkt is the potential output of country i for period t. The output-gap variable 
used is the percentage deviation of total actual output from total potential output.

151
The behavior of the European monetary authority is thus assumed to be the same as the 
historically estimated behavior of the Bundesbank, except that the response is now to 
the total variables for the four countries rather than just to the German variables.
Second, the term structure equations for France, Italy, and the Netherlands were 
dropped, and their long-term interest rates were assumed to move one for one with the 
German rate. The long-term German interest rate equation was retained as is. The only 
explanatory variables in this equation are the lagged value of the long-term rate and the 
current value and lagged values of the short-term rate.
Third, the exchange rate equations for France, Italy, and the Netherlands were 
dropped, and their exchange rates were fixed to the German rate. The German exchange 
rate equation has as explanatory variables the German price level relative to the U.S. 
price level and the German short-term interest rate relative to the U.S. short-term interest 
rate. This equation was used as is except that the German price level was replaced 
by the total price level for the four countries. (The German short-term interest rate is 
now, of course, the common short-term interest rate of the four countries, as discussed 
above.)
No other changes were made to the model. To summarize, then, in this assumed 
EMU regime, the two main changes are (1) the postulation of a four-country interest 
rate rule that responds to the four-country output gap and the four-country inflation 
rate and (2) the postulation of an exchange rate equation for the four-country cur­
rency that responds to the four-country price level relative to the U.S. price level 
and the four-country short-term interest rate relative to the U.S. short-term interest 
rate.
The results for this regime are presented in column 3 in Table 12.1. The output 
variability results are quite interesting. The big loser is Germany, where Lt rises from 
2.29 to 4.53. Italy and the Netherlands are also hurt, but not by as much (from 7.34 to 
7.76 for Italy and from 9.15 to 10.57 for the Netherlands). France is helped, where L, 
falls from 2.85 to 2.03. Column 2 versus 1 shows that the individual interest rate rule 
for France is not stabilizing, and column 3 versus 2 shows that France gains by being 
part of a stabilizing rule. If the French by themselves are not going to stabilize, they are 
better off joining a group that at least in part responds to French shocks. (Does this help 
explain why France has generally been quite supportive of the EMU?) Germany is hurt 
because its individual rule is quite stabilizing, and much of this is lost when Germany 
joins the other three.
Regarding price variability, again Germany is hurt and France is helped. In this case 
Italy is also helped and there is essentially no change for the Netherlands. Interest rate 
variability (which is the same for all four countries) is larger for France and smaller for 
the others.
The United Kingdom is not much affected by the four countries joining together 
(column 3 versus 2). Its interest rate rule is still quite stabilizing (column 3 versus 1). 
For the final experiment the United Kingdom was added to the four-country regime. 
Everything is the same in this five-country regime except that total output now includes 
UK output and the total price level now includes the UK price level. The UK interest 
rate rule, exchange rate equation, and term structure equation are dropped.

152
12 || EMU Stabilization Costs
The five-country results are presented in column 4 in Table 12.1. These results are 
also interesting. The United Kingdom is definitely hurt regarding output variability 
from joining the group. L, rises from 5.74 to 6.20, an 8 percent increase. Germany is 
hurt even more, and it is now the case that Lt for Germany is larger in column 4 than 
in column 1, where the German rule is dropped. The other three countries are helped 
slightly by the United Kingdom’s joining.
The effects on the United States are modest for all of the cases.
12.5 
Conclusion
This chapter has used a particular methodology for examining the stabilizations costs 
of the EMU, and Table 12.1 provides quantitative estimates of these costs for a four- 
country and a five-country regime. The estimated costs are large for Germany and 
modest for Italy and the Netherlands. France actually benefits. The costs for the United 
Kingdom, if it joined, would be noticeable, but not nearly as large as they are for 
Germany.
These estimates in Table 12.1 are conditional, of course, on particular interest rate 
rules for each country. The rules used in this chapter are the estimated rules. If different 
rules were used, say a more stabilizing individual rule for France, different results would 
be obtained. In general, the more stabilizing a rule is for a given country, the larger 
are the stabilization costs of joining the EMU likely to be. The results also depend 
on the choice of the EMU rule. For the work in this chapter the German rule has 
been used with different output and inflation variables, but other choices are clearly 
possible.
Because of the preliminary nature of the results, there are a number of extensions 
that might be interesting to pursue in future work. One issue is whether fiscal-policy 
rules, like the tax rate rule in the last chapter, should be considered. If a rule like this 
were used by a country after joining the EMU, it would likely lower the stabilization 
costs of joining. At times, however, such a rule might call for a tax rate cut that would 
violate the fiscal-policy constraints that are imposed on countries that join the EMU. If 
certain tax rate cuts were not allowed, this would lessen the rule’s effectiveness.
There are some possible biases in the Table 12.1 estimates that are more difficult 
to examine. There is, for example, no labor mobility in the model, and to the extent 
that there is labor mobility between countries in Europe the real stabilization costs are 
likely to be smaller than those in Table 12.1. It would be difficult to modify the MC 
model to try to account for labor mobility. In addition, if the change in regimes results 
in the shocks across countries being more highly correlated than they were historically, 
this is likely to bias the current cost estimates upward. The more highly correlated the 
shocks, the more the common European monetary policy rule is likely to be stabilizing 
for the individual countries. It would be difficult to try to estimate how the historical 
correlations might change.
It may also be the case that the historical shocks used for the stochastic-simulation 
draws are too large. The shocks are estimated residuals in the stochastic equations, 

12.5 || Conclusion
153
and they reflect both pure random shocks and possible misspecification. However, if 
the shocks are too large, it is not clear how the cost estimates in Table 12.1 would be 
affected, since using the correct smaller shocks would lower the values of L; for all the 
experiments.
Another issue to consider is whether the EMU regime increases credibility. If, for 
example, Italian long-term interest rates are lower after Italy joins (because Italian 
policy is then more credible), this could have a beneficial effect on Italian growth. 
Level effects of this sort are not taken into account in this study, since only stabilization 
costs are being estimated.

13.1 
Introduction
The results in Chapter 10 suggest that the loss in accuracy from using the certainty 
equivalence assumption to solve optimal control problems is small.1 The CE assumption 
was used in Chapter 11 to solve optimal control problems of the monetary authority. 
The stabilization analysis in Chapter 11 required both the use of stochastic simulation 
and the solving of optimal control problems using CE, which allowed the stabilization 
effectiveness of different rules to be analyzed. This chapter shows that the analysis 
in Chapter 11 can also be applied to rational expectations (RE) models under the CE 
assumption.
1. The results in this chapter are updates of those in Fair (2003a).
Almost all the recent studies that have used RE models to analyze stabilization 
questions have relied on small linear models. For example, only one of the studies in 
Taylor (1999a)—Levin, Wieland, and Williams (1999) (LWW)—uses large-scale mod­
els, and LWW do not solve optimal control problems. They use linearizations of the 
Federal Reserve model and the Taylor multicountry model to compute unconditional 
second moments of the variables in the models. In the recent study of Clarida, Gali, 
and Gertler (2000) a four-equation calibrated model is used. Finan and Tetlow (1999) 
discuss the optimal control of large models with rational expectations, but their method 
is limited to linear models. The results in this chapter show that the analysis of sta­
bilization questions need not be limited to small linear models when the models have 
rational expectations.
The model used for the results in this chapter is the US(EX,PIM) model discussed in 
section 11.4.1 with the addition of rational expectations in the bond market and where 
households have rational expectations with respect to future values of income. This RE 
version of the US(EX,PIM) model is presented in section 13.8.
This chapter is based on the assumption of known coefficients. (As in Chapters 11 
and 12, a is taken to be fixed.) It does not consider, for example, the possibility of

13.2 
The RE Model
The RE model was presented as model 1.2 in section 1.4, and it is repeated here:
fi(yt, yt_Y, . . . , yt_p, Et_{yt, Et_Yyt+Y, . . . , Et_vyt+h, xt, af) = uit
i = 1, . . . , n, t — T,
where yt is an n-dimensional vector of endogenous variables, xt is a vector of exoge­
nous variables, Et_x is the conditional expectations operator based on the model and 
on information through period t — 1, a;- is a vector of parameters, and uit is an error 
term with mean zero that may be correlated across equations but not across time. The 
first m equations are assumed to be stochastic, with the remaining equations identities. 
The function may be nonlinear in variables, parameters, and expectations.
13.3 
Solution of RE Models
Consider the solution of model 1.2 for period t. Assume that estimates of a,- are 
available, that current and future values of the exogenous variables are available, and 
that all values for periods t — 1 and back are known. If the current and future values 
of the uit error terms are set to zero (their expected values), the solution of the model 
is straightforward. A popular method is the extended path (EP) method in Fair and 
Taylor (1983), which has been programmed into a number of computer packages. The 

156
13 || RE Models
method iterates over solution paths. Values of the expectations for period t through 
period t + h + k + h are first guessed, where h is the maximum lead in the model 
and k is chosen as discussed below. Given these guesses, the model can be solved for 
periods t through t + h + k in the usual ways (usually period by period using the Gauss- 
Seidel technique). This solution provides new values for the expectations through period 
t + h + k, namely the solution values. Given these new values, the model can be solved 
again for periods t through t + h + k, which provides new values for the expectations, 
and so on. Convergence is reached when the predicted values for periods t through 
t + h from one iteration to the next are within a prescribed tolerance level of each 
other. (There is no guarantee of convergence, but in most applications convergence is 
not a problem.)
In this process the guessed values of the expectations for periods t + h + k + 1 
through t + h + k + h (the h periods beyond the last period solved) have not been 
changed. If the solution values for periods t through t + h depend in a nontrivial way 
on these guesses, then overall convergence has not been achieved. To check for this, 
the entire process can be repeated for k one larger. If increasing k by one has a trivial 
effect (based on a tolerance criterion) on the solution values for t through t + h, then 
overall convergence has been achieved; otherwise k must continue to be increased until 
the criterion is met. In practice what is usually done is to experiment to find the value 
of k that is large enough to make it unlikely that further increases are necessary for any 
experiment that might be run and then do no further checking using larger values of k.
The solution requires values for xt through xt+h+k, the current and future values 
of the exogenous variables. These values are what the agents are assumed to know 
or expect at the beginning of period t. If agents are assumed not to have perfect 
foresight regarding xt, then after convergence as described above has been achieved, 
one more step is needed. This step is to solve the model for period t using the computed 
expectations and the actual value of xt, not the value that the agents expected. This is 
just a standard Gauss-Seidel solution for period t. To the extent that the expected value 
of xt differs from the actual value, Et_1yt will differ from the final solution value for 
yt. The final solution value for yt is conditional on (1) the use of zero errors, (2) the 
actual value of xt, and (3) the values of xt through xt+h+k that are used by the agents.
So far only the solution for period t has been described. In many cases one is 
interested in a dynamic simulation over a number of periods, say the Q periods t 
through t + Q — 1. If it is assumed that all exogenous variable values are known by 
the agents, this simulation can be performed with just one use of the EP method, where 
the path is from t through t+Q — \ + h+ k rather than just t through t + h + k. With 
known exogenous variables, the solution values for the expectations are the same as the 
overall solution values, and so if convergence is reached for the expectations for periods 
t through t + Q — 1 + h, the model has been solved for periods t through t + Q — 1.
If the actual values of the exogenous variables differ from those used by the agents, 
then Q separate uses of the EP method are required to solve for t through t + Q — 1. It is 
no longer the case, for example, that Et_pyt+\ equals Etyt+l, because the information 
sets through periods t — 1 and t differ. The latter includes knowledge of xt and the 
former does not. For simplicity this chapter will only consider the case in which agents 

13.4 || Optimal Control for RE Models
157
know the exogenous variables. It is straightforward but somewhat tedious to incorporate 
the case in which the exogenous variables are not known.
A useful way of estimating the computational cost of the EP method is to calculate 
the number of “passes” through the model that are used. A pass using the Gauss-Seidel 
technique is going through the equations of the model once for a given period and 
computing the values of the left-hand-side variables given the values of the right-hand­
side variables. Let N denote the number of passes that are needed to obtain Gauss-Seidel 
convergence for a given period, and let M denote the number of times the entire path 
has to be computed to obtain overall convergence (assuming that k has been chosen 
large enough ahead of time). Then the total number of passes that are needed to solve 
the model for the Q periods t through t + Q — lis N • M • (Q + h + k), since the path 
consists of Q + h + k periods. If the model does not have rational expectations, the 
total number of passes is just N • Q.
13.4 
Optimal Control for RE Models
The optimal control procedure outlined in section 1.7 can be used for RE models under 
the CE assumption. The procedure simply requires that the model be capable of being 
solved for a given set of control values. The solution can be done using the EP method 
discussed above.
To set up the problem, assume that the period of interest is t through t + T — 1 (a 
horizon of length T) and that the objective is to maximize the expected value of W, 
where W is
t+T-l
E &(,vs. Xs). 
(13.1)
s=t
Let zt be a -dimensional vector of control variables, where zt is a subset of xt, 
and let z be the q • (T + h + k)-dimensional vector of all the control values: z = 
(zf, . . . , zt+T+h+k_f), where k is taken to be large enough for solution convergence 
through period t + T — I.2 If all the error terms are set to zero, then for each value 
of z one can compute a value of W by first solving the model for yt, . . . , yt+T_i 
and then using these values along with the values for xt, . . . , vz+y_| to compute W 
in equation 13.1. The problem can then be turned over to an optimization algorithm 
like DFP.
2. Remember that the guessed values of the expectations for periods t + T + h + k through t + T + 
h + k + h — 1 are never changed in the solution, k has to be large enough so that increasing it by one has a 
trivial effect on the relevant solution values.
Once the problem is solved, z*,  the optimal vector of control values for period t, 
is implemented. If, for example, the Fed is solving the control problem and there is 
one control variable—the interest rate—then the Fed would implement through open 
market operations the optimal value of the interest rate for period t. In the process of 
computing z*  the optimal values for periods t + 1 through t + T + h + k — 1 are also 

158
13 || RE Models
computed. Agents are assumed to know these values when they solve the model to 
form their expectations. For the Fed example, one can think of the Fed implementing 
the period t value of the interest rate and at the same time announcing the planned future 
values.
After z*  is implemented and period t passes, the entire process can be repeated 
beginning in t + 1. In the present deterministic case, however, the optimal value of zt+[ 
chosen at the beginning of t + 1 would be the same as the value chosen at the beginning 
of t, and so there is no need to reoptimize. Reoptimization is needed in the stochastic 
case, which is discussed in section 13.6.
Each evaluation of W requires N • M • (T + h + k) passes, since the path is of length 
T +h + k. Each iteration of the DFP algorithm requires 2q • (T + h + k) evaluations 
of W to compute the derivatives numerically, assuming that two function evaluations are 
used per derivative calculation, and then a few more evaluations to do the line searching. 
Let L denote the number of evaluations that are needed for the line searching after the 
derivatives have been computed, and let I denote the total number of iterations of the 
DFP algorithm that are needed for convergence to the optimum. The total number of 
evaluations of W is thus I • (2q • (T + h + k) + L). Since from section 13.3 the number 
of passes needed to solve a model for T periods is N • M • (T + h + k), the total number 
of passes needed to compute z*  is N • M • (T + h + k) • I • (2q • (T + h + k) + L).
13.5 
Stochastic Simulation of RE Models
Forget optimal control for now and assume that some (not necessarily optimal) control 
rule is postulated. The stabilization features of a rule can be examined using stochastic 
simulation, as in Chapter 11. One first needs an estimate of typical shocks to the 
economy, and as in section 11.3.2 these can be taken to be the estimated residuals.
At the risk of some repetition, it will be useful to outline the stochastic simulation 
procedure for the case of an RE model. Assume that the periods of interest are t through 
t + S — 1. The steps to estimate the variances of the endogenous variables for these 
periods under the rule are as follows:
1. Let u,  an m-dimensional vector, denote a particular draw of the m error terms for 
period t, drawn from a set of estimated residuals. Assume that agents know this draw 
but use zero values of the errors for periods t + 1 and beyond. (This means that the 
certainty equivalence assumption is being used for agents for future periods.) Then 
solve the model (with the rule included) for period t using the EP method. Record 
the solution values for period t.
*
2. Draw a vector of error terms for period t + 1, w  p and use these errors and the 
solution values for period t to solve the model for period t + 1 using the EP method. 
For this solution agents are assumed to use zero values of the errors for periods t + 2 
and beyond. Record the solution values for period t + 1.
*
3. Repeat step 2 for periods t + 2 through t + S — 1. This set of solution values is one 
repetition. From this repetition one obtains a prediction of each endogenous variable 
for periods t through t + S — 1.

13.6 || Stochastic Simulation and Optimal Control
159
4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 J times for J repetitions.
5. Let y! denote the value on the jth repetition of variable i for period t. Given J 
repetitions, equations 9.1-9.3 can be used to compute the mean and variance of 
variable i for period t. In addition, can be computed using equations 11.1-11.2.
In the above steps agents are assumed to know the draw u*  when solving the model 
beginning in period t, to know the draw u*  j when solving the model beginning in period 
t + 1, and so on. The steps could be set up so that agents do not know these draws and 
use zero errors instead. In this case the expectations would be computed using all zero 
errors, and after this the model would be solved using these computed expectations and 
the drawn error vector. For reasons that will be clear in the next section, the focus here 
is on the case where the current period draw is known.
The total number of passes that are needed for the J repetitions is J • S • N • M • 
(h + k), since each path is of length h + k and there are J • S paths solved.
13.6 
Stochastic Simulation and Optimal Control
In the optimal control case the control rule is dropped and an optimal control problem 
is solved to determine the values of the control variables. The steps that are needed to 
estimate the variances of the endogenous variables in this case are similar to those in the 
previous section. The difference is that after each draw of the error vector an optimal 
control problem has to be solved. Continue to assume that the periods of interest are t 
through t + S — 1. The steps are:
1. Draw u  as in section 13.5. Assume that both the control authority and the agents 
know this draw but use zero values of the errors for periods t + 1 and beyond. 
Given this draw and the zero future errors, solve the (deterministic) control problem 
beginning in period t as in section 13.4. This solution produces z,
 the optimal value 
of the control vector for period t, which is implemented. Record the solution values 
for period t.
*
*
2. Draw a vector of error terms for period t + 1, m  p and use these errors and the 
solution values for period t to solve the control problem beginning in period t + 1. 
For this problem the control authority and the agents are assumed to use zero values 
of the errors for periods t + 2 and beyond. This solution produces z  p the optimal 
value of the control vector for period t + 1, which is implemented. Record the 
solution values for period t + 1.
*
*
3. Repeat step 2 for periods t + 2 through t + S — 1. This set of solution values is 
one repetition. From this repetition one obtains the implemented optimal values, 
z,  . . . , z +5_P and a prediction of each endogenous variable for periods t through 
t + S — 1 based on these values.
*
*
4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 J times for J repetitions. This produces J values of y-t, 
as in section 13.5. In addition, L, can be computed using equations 11.1-11.2.

160
13 || RE Models
The values of Lz computed using this optimal control procedure can be compared 
with the values computed in section 13.5 using other rules. The steps are set up so 
that both procedures assume that agents know the current period draw of the error 
terms. In addition, any rule used in section 13.5 in effect knows the draw, as does 
the control authority in this section. The information sets are thus the same for the 
comparisons.
In step 1 a control problem is solved beginning in period t. In section 13.4 the horizon 
of the control authority regarding the objective function was taken to be length T, and 
values of the control variables were computed for periods t through t + T + h + k — 1. 
In step 1, however, it may be possible to shorten the horizon. What step 1 needs are 
only the solution values for period t (including z*),  and the horizon only needs to be 
taken long enough so that increasing it further has a trivial effect (based on a tolerance 
criterion) on the values for period t. One can initially experiment with different values 
of the horizon to see how large it has to be to meet the tolerance criterion. Let R denote 
this length. This value of R can be used in step 2 for the control problem beginning in 
period t + 1, and so on.
The overall procedure requires that 5 control problems be solved per repetition, and 
so with J repetitions there are J • S control problems solved, each with a horizon of 
length R. The total number of passes in this case is thus:
Number of passes = J • 5 • N • M • (7? + h + k) • I • (2q • (R + h + k) + L). (13.2)
In terms of speed it is obviously important that efficient code be written for passing 
through the model, since most of the time is spent passing through. A practical way to 
proceed after the code is written is to set limits on N, M, I, and J that are small enough 
to make the problem computationally feasible (that is, completion within an hour or 
two). Once the bugs are out and the (preliminary) results seem sensible, the limits can 
be gradually increased to gain more accuracy. If two cases are being compared using 
stochastic simulation, such as a simple rule versus an optimal control procedure, the 
same draws of the errors should be used for both cases. This can considerably lessen 
stochastic-simulation error for the comparisons.
13.7 
Coding
As just noted, it is important that efficient code be written to pass through the 
equations of a model. Let PASS(r) denote a subroutine written to pass through the 
model once for period r. Let SOLVE(s,Q) denote a subroutine written to solve a ra­
tional expectations model for periods s through s + Q — 1 using the extended path 
method. SOLVE(s,Q) calls PASS(r) many times for r equal to s through s + Q — 1 + 
h + k, where h is the maximum lead and k is chosen as discussed in the text. Let 
DFP(s,R) denote a subroutine written to solve an optimal control problem with be­
ginning period s and necessary horizon R (as discussed in section 13.6). DFP(s,R) 
calls SOLVE(s,R) one time per evaluation of the objective function W. Finally, let 
DRAW(s) denote a subroutine written to draw a vector of error terms for period s.

An Example: An RE Version ofthe US(EX,PI M) Model
A modified version of the US(EX,PIM) model that was used for the results in the 
second half of Table 11.2 was used for the present calculations. Five equations were 
changed: the three consumption equations, 1, 2, and 3, and the two term structure 
equations, 23 and 24. In each of the consumption equations the income variable, 
which enters as a current value, was replaced by the average of the values led one 
through four quarters. In other words, if yt denotes the income variable, it was replaced 
by (l/4)(y?+i + y?+2 + y?+3 + »+4)- The three equations were not reestimated; the 
existing coefficient estimate for the income variable was retained. Equation 23, which 
determines RB, was replaced by
= -(/?S) + ^+1 + ^t+2 + R$t+3 + R$t+4 + ^t+5 + R$t+6 + ^7+7). (23)
Equation 24, which determines RM, was replaced by the same equation. The expec­
tations of the future values were assumed to be rational (model consistent). For this 
version the maximum lead length, h, is 7.
The problem in row 9 in Table 11.2 was solved for this version of the model. As in 
Chapter 11, the estimated residuals were added to the stochastic equations and taken 
to be exogenous. The residuals that are added for equations 1, 2, 3, 23, and 24 are the 
residuals computed from the new specification, so that the equations fit perfectly when 
the residuals are added. The estimated residuals used for the draws, however, are the 
residuals estimated from the original specification. The draws are thus the same as they 
are for the results in row 9 in Table 11.2.
The parameters for this problem are as follows. The simulation period is 1994:1­
1998:4, and so 5 is 20. (Remember that 5 is the number of deterministic optimal control 
problems solved per trial.) k was taken to be 8, and some experimentation revealed that 
a value of 5 for R was adequate. The DFP iteration limit, I, was taken to be 10. The 
number of function evaluations needed for line searching, L, turned out to be about 
10. No limits were imposed on N and M. The tolerance criterion for a Gauss-Seidel 
iteration was 0.1 percent, and the tolerance criterion for extended path convergence was 

162
13 || RE Models
0.2 percent. It turned out that extended path convergence was almost always reached in 
2 iterations, so M was effectively 2. The average value of N turned out to be 3.56. The 
number of control variables, q, is 1, where the control variable is RS. The total number 
of trials, J, was taken to be 100.
Using these numbers the formula 13.2 gives a value of 142,400,000 passes. The 
actual number of passes was 142,443,689. The example was run using the Fair- 
Parke (1995) program. The time taken was 15.5 hours on a 1.7 Ghz PC, which comes 
out to about 2,550 passes per second.
Regarding Table 11.2, it is interesting to note that the variability was less for the RE 
version. The value of Lz for Y was 2.03, which compares to 2.54 in row 9. The value 
for PF was 3.11 compared to 3.17, and the value for RS was 0.63 compared to 0.96. 
These differences are as expected. A given change in RS is more effective in the RE 
version because the long-term interest rates respond faster and consumption responds 
faster. More stability can thus be achieved with similar interest rate changes.
The time of 15.5 hours on a fairly standard PC shows that the procedure in this 
chapter is in the realm of computational feasibility even for a nonlinear model of over 
100 equations with a nontrivial lead length (that is, 7). As mentioned above, a good 
approach is to set fairly small limits on the relevant parameters and then increase the 
limits to gain more accuracy after the bugs are worked out. One programming issue 
that is important is setting the step size for the numeric derivatives used by the DFP 
algorithm. The step size must be larger than the solution tolerance criteria in order for 
the computed derivatives to be any good. Some experimentation is usually needed to 
get this right.
For the non-RE version of the model, M is 1 and h and k are zero, and in this case 
the number of passes in the above example would be 7,120,000. This is 5 percent of 
the number of passes for the RE version.
13.9 
Conclusion
This chapter has shown that it is computationally feasible to solve stochastic-simulation 
and optimal control problems for large nonlinear models with rational expectations if 
certainty equivalence is used. The analysis of monetary and fiscal policies need not be 
restricted to the use of small models or linear models. In particular, results like those 
in Table 11.2 can be obtained for RE models.
What is lost by the use of the open loop procedure of certainty equivalence and re­
optimization in section 13.6? Agents know, when they solve the model to form their 
expectations, the current period values of the control variables that are implemented 
and the announced planned future values. They take the planned future values as deter­
ministic rather than stochastic, and they take the future error terms to be deterministic, 
namely zero. Agents do not take into account the fact that everything will be redone 
at the beginning of each period after the error terms for that period are realized and 
known. The overall procedure is thus not fully optimal. In some cases this may be a 
serious problem, and if so, the procedure in section 13.6 is of little use.

Model Comparisons
14.1 
Introduction
This chapter compares the US model with two other models in terms of predictive 
accuracy. The two other models are a vector autoregressive (VAR) model and an 
autoregressive components (AC) model. It will be seen that the US model dominates 
the others, which is consistent with previous results.1 Two versions of the US model are 
used for the comparisons: the regular version and a version in which an autoregressive 
equation is added for each exogenous variable. This second version will be called the 
“US+” model.
1. See Fair (1994), sections 8.6 and 8.7. Chapter 9 in Fair (1994) contains a comparison of the overall 
MC model with an autoregressive version, but this work has not been updated here.
14.2 
The US+ Model
The US+ model is the US model with an additional 85 stochastic equations. Each of the 
additional equations explains an exogenous variable and is a fifth-order autoregressive 
equation with the constant term and time trend added. Equations are estimated for all the 
exogenous variables in the model except the price of imports, PIM, the age variables, the 
dummy variables, the variables created from peak-to-peak interpolations, and variables 
that are constants or nearly constants. All the exogenous variables in the model are listed 
in Table A.2. Those for which autoregressive equations are not estimated are: all the 
dummy variables, AG1, AG2, AG3, CDA, DELD, DELH, DEEK, DRS, HFS, HM, IHB, 
IHHA, JJP, LAM, MUH, PIM, T, TAUG, TAUS, TRGR, WLDF, WLDG, and WLDS. 
Excluding these variables left 85 variables for which autoregressive equations were 
estimated. Logs were used for some of the variables. Logs were not used for ratios, for 
variables that were negative or sometimes negative, or for variables that were sometimes 
close to zero. The estimation technique was ordinary least squares.
163

164
14 || Model Comparisons
PIM is a variable that changed very little in the 1950s and 1960s, had a huge increase 
in the 1970s, and then changed little after that. Its movements over the sample period are 
heavily influenced by OPEC oil-pricing decisions. It does not seem sensible to postulate 
a time-series equation for this variable, and so it is taken to be exogenous in the US+ 
model. It is also taken to be exogenous in the VAR model below.
The US+ model has no hard-to-forecast exogenous variables (except PIM), and in 
this sense it is comparable to the VAR and AC models discussed below, which have 
no exogenous variables other than the constant term and time trend (and PIM for the 
VAR model). On the other hand, adding autoregressive equations for the exogenous 
variables may bias the results against the model. McNees (1981, p. 404) argues that 
the method handicaps the model: “It is easy to think of exogenous variables (policy 
variables) whose future values can be anticipated or controlled with complete certainty 
even if the historical values can be represented by covariance stationary processes; to 
do so introduces superfluous errors into the model solution.”
14.3 
The VAR Model
The seven variables in the VAR model used here are (1) the log of real GDP, log GDPR, 
(2) the log of the GDP price deflator, log GDPD, (3) the log of the wage rate, log WF, 
(4) the log of the money supply, log M1, (5) the unemployment rate, UR, (6) the three- 
month Treasury bill rate, RS, and (7) the log of the import price deflator, log PIM. These 
are the same variables used by Sims (1980) with the exception of RS, which has been 
added.
Each of the first six variables is taken to be a function of the constant, the time 
trend, its first four lagged values, and the first two lagged values of each of the other 
six variables. There are thus 18 coefficients to estimate per each of the six equations. 
As noted above, no equation is postulated for log PIM. PIM is taken to be exogenous.
The results in Fair and Shiller (1990) and Fair (1994), Chapter 8, show that VAR 
results are not very sensitive to somewhat different choices of lags. The choice here of 
only two lags for the non-own variables saves degrees of freedom.
14.4 
The AC Model
If one is only interested in GDP predictions, the results in Fair and Shiller (1990) 
suggest that “autoregressive components” (AC) models are more accurate than VAR 
models. An AC model is one in which each component of GDP is regressed on its 
own lagged values. GDP is then determined from the GDP identity, as the sum of the 
components. AC models do not have the problem, as VAR models do, of adding large 
numbers of parameters as the number of variables (components, in the AC case) is 
increased.
There are 17 components of GDPR in the US model (counting the statistical dis­
crepancy STATP), and the AC model consists of estimated equations for each of these 

14.5 || Outside Sample RMSEs
165
components.2 Each of the 17 components is taken to be a function of the constant, the 
time trend, and its first five lagged values. The equations are in log form except for 
the equations for IVF and STATP.3 The final equation of the AC model is the GDPR 
identity, where GDPR is the sum of the 17 components (with a minus sign for IM).
2. The 17 components, in alphabetical order, are CD, CN, COG, COS, CS, EX, IHF, IHH, IKB, IKF, 
IKG, IKH, IM, IVF, PSI13(JG • HG + JM • HM), PSI13 ■ JS ■ HS, and STATP. The variable PSI13(JG ■ 
HG + JM ■ HM) is federal government purchases of services, and the variable PSI 13 • JS ■ HS is state and 
local government purchases of services.
3. For the results in sections 8.6 and 8.7 in Fair (1994), each of the equations of the AC model had 
the first two lagged values of GDPR added. As noted in note 4 below, the results are not sensitive to this 
choice.
4. If the first two lagged values of GDPR are added to the AC equations, the RMSEs are 0.51, 1.44, 
and 2.35 for the one-, four-, and eight-quarter-ahead predictions, respectively, which are quite close to the 
values in Table 14.1.
14.5 
Outside Sample RMSEs
One- through eight-quarter-ahead outside sample RMSEs were computed for each of 
the four models. Consider the US model. The model was first estimated (by 2SLS) for 
the 1954:1-1982:4 period, and these coefficients were used in a dynamic prediction 
for the 1983:1-1984:4 period. These predictions were recorded. The model was then 
estimated for the 1954:1-1983:1 period, and these coefficients were used to predict the 
1983:2-1985:1 period. This process was repeated through the end of the sample. The 
last estimation period was 1954:1-2002:2, and the last prediction period was 2002:3­
2002:3. This gave 79 one-quarter-ahead predictions, 78 two-quarter-ahead predictions, 
and so on through 72 eight-quarter-ahead predictions. Root mean squared errors were 
then computed. The same process was repeated for the other three models. For the 
US+ model the 85 additional equations were treated like the 30 structural equations, 
namely reestimated for each sample period. (The 85 additional equations are estimated 
by ordinary least squares.)
The results are presented in Table 14.1 for the log of real GDP, the log of the 
GDP price deflator, the unemployment rate, and the bill rate. For the AC model the 
only relevant variable is the log of real GDP. The results are easy to summarize. For 
GDPR the AC model is more accurate than the VAR model. The US model is more 
accurate than the AC model, and the US+ model is as well, except for the one-quarter- 
ahead prediction, where there is essentially a tie.4 For GDPD the VAR model is best 
by a slight amount for the one-quarter-ahead prediction, but by the eight-quarter- 
ahead prediction it is noticeably the worst. For both UR and RS the US and US+ 
models are better than the VAR model, except for the one-quarter-ahead prediction 
for UR, where the VAR model is slightly better than the US model. Overall, by eight 
quarters ahead the US and US+ models are substantially more accurate than the VAR 
model.

The one-quarter-ahead RMSEs in Table 14.1 are based on 79 predictions. The RMSEs 
cannot be used to tell whether the predictions from one model have independent 
information from those in another model. The FS tests allow this to be done. In the 
present context the question is whether the VAR model, which is much smaller than 
the US model, contains any information useful for prediction that is not in the US 
model. Even though the US model generally beats the VAR model in Table 14.1, the 
VAR model may still have independent information. The same question can be asked 
of the AC model versus the US model and of the AC model versus the VAR model.
It will be useful to review the FS procedure briefly. Let t_sY\t denote a prediction of 
Yt made from model 1 using information available at time t — s, and let t_sY2t denote 
the same thing for model 2. The parameter s is the length ahead of the prediction, s > 0. 
The test is based on the following regression equation:
Yt - Yt_s = a + /3(t_sYu - Yt_s) + y(t_sY2t - Yt_s) + v?. 
(14.1)
If neither model 1 nor model 2 contains any information useful for s-period-ahead 
predictions of Yt, then the estimates of and y should both be zero. In this case the 
estimate of the constant term a would be the average 5 period change in Y. If both 
models contain independent information for 5-period-ahead predictions, then ft and y 
should both be nonzero. If both models contain information, but the information in, 
say, model 2 is completely contained in model 1 and model 1 contains further relevant 
information as well, then but not y should be nonzero.5
5. If both models contain the same information, then the predictions are perfectly correlated, and (5 and 
y are not separately identified.

The procedure is to estimate equation 14.1 for different models’ predictions and test 
the hypothesis that ft = 0 and the hypothesis H2 that y = 0. H\ is the hypothesis that 
model l’s predictions contain no information relevant to predicting 5 periods ahead not 
in the constant term and in model 2, and H2 is the hypothesis that model 2’s predictions 
contain no information not in the constant term and in model 1.
This procedure bears some relation to encompassing tests, but the setup and interests 
are somewhat different. For example, it does not make sense in the current setup to 
constrain ft and y to sum to one, as is usually the case for encompassing tests. If 
both models’ predictions are just noise, the estimates of both ft and y should be zero. 
Also, say that the true process generating Yt is Yt = Xt + Zt, where Xt and Zt are 
independently distributed. Say that model 1 specifies that Yt is a function of Xt only 
and that model 2 specifies that Yt is a function of Zt only. Both predictions should thus 
have coefficients of one in equation 14.1, and so in this case and y would sum to 
two. It also does not make sense in the current setup to constrain the constant term a to 
be zero. If, for example, both models’ predictions were noise and equation 14.1 were 
estimated without a constant term, then the estimates of and y would not generally 
be zero when the mean of the dependent variable is nonzero.
It is also not sensible in the current setup to assume that vt is identically distributed. It 
is likely that vt is heteroskedastic. If, for example, a = 0, (3 = 1, and y = 0, vt is simply 
the prediction error from model 1, and in general prediction errors are heteroskedastic. 
Also, if k-period-ahead predictions are considered, where k > 1, this introduces a k — 1 
order moving average process to the error term in equation 14.1. Both heteroskedasticity 
and the moving average process can be corrected for in the estimation of the standard 
errors of the coefficient estimates. This can be done using the procedure given by Hansen 
(1982), Cumby, Huizinga, and Obstfeld (1983), and White and Domowitz (1984) for 
the estimation of asymptotic covariance matrices. Let 6 = (a y). Also, define X as 
the T x 3 matrix of variables, whose row t is Xt = (1 t-sY^t — Yt_s t_sY2t — Yt_s), 
and let ut — Yt — Yt_s — Xt0. The covariance matrix of 9, V(0), is
V(0) = (XXyYS(XXr{,

where 6 is the ordinary least squares estimate of 6 and s is the prediction horizon. When 
5 equals 1, the second term on the right-hand side of 14.3 is zero, and the covariance 
matrix is simply White’s (1980) correction for heteroskedasticity.

As an alternative to equation 14.1 the level of Yt could be regressed on the predicted 
levels and the constant term. If Yt is an integrated process, then any sensible prediction 
of Yt will be cointegrated with Yt itself. In the level regression, the sum of and y 
will thus be constrained in effect to one, and one would in effect be estimating one less 
parameter. If Yt is an integrated process, running the levels regression with an additional 
independent variable Yt_1 (thereby estimating fl and y without constraining their sum 
to one) is essentially equivalent to the differenced regression 14.1. For variables that 
are not integrated, the levels version of 14.1 can be used.
The results of various regressions are presented in Table 14.2. For log GDPR and 
log GDPD equation 14.1 is used, and for UR and RS the equation in levels in used. 
One- and four-quarter-ahead predictions are analyzed. Again, the results are easy 
to summarize. For GDPR the AC model dominates the VAR model for both the

at best only a small amount of information not in the predictions from the US and US+ 
models.
14.7 Sources of Uncertainty
The results in this section show the breakdown of the variance of a prediction into 
that due to the additive error terms, to the coefficient estimates, and to the possible 
misspecification of the model. The breakdown between the first two of these has already 
been presented in Table 9.4. The measures of variability in Table 9.4 are ranges, and in 
this section the measures used are the square roots of the variances (standard deviations) 
as computed by equation 9.2.
The results in Table 9.4 are based on 2,000 trials, and the same data used for 
the no-bias-correction calculations in this table are used for the a and b rows in 
Table 14.3. Standard deviations for the one-, four-, and eight-quarter-ahead predictions 
are presented for the log of real GDP, the log of the GDP deflator, the unemployment 
rate, and the bill rate. For the a row the coefficients are not reestimated on each trial, 
whereas they are for the b row. Comparing rows a and b shows that much more of 
the variance of a prediction is due to the additive error terms than to the coefficient 
estimates.
To account for the possible misspecification of the model requires more work. The 
following is a brief outline of a method for doing this.6 Let denote the stochastic­
6. The method outlined here was first presented in Fair (1980a). It is also discussed in Fair (1984), 
Chapter 8, and Fair (1994), Chapter 7. The new feature here is that for the stochastic simulations the 
coefficients are estimated on each trial, as in Chapter 9, rather than being drawn from estimated distributions.

simulation estimate of the variance of the prediction error for a k period ahead prediction 
of variable i from a simulation beginning in period t. This estimate is as presented in 
equation 9.3, except that a k subscript has been added to denote the length ahead of the 
prediction.
Let the prediction period begin one period after the end of the estimation period, 
and call this period 5. From a stochastic simulation beginning in period 5 one obtains 
an estimate of the variance of the prediction error, dr? in equation 9.3, where again k 
refers to the length ahead of the prediction. From this simulation one also obtains an 
estimate of the expected value of the k period ahead prediction of variable i, ftisk, in 
equation 9.1. The difference between this estimate and the actual value, yis+k_[, is the 
mean prediction error, denoted €jsk.
Usk Sis+k-t ftisk" 
(14.5)
If it is assumed that jfisk exactly equals the true expected value, then eisk in equa­
tion 14.5 is a sample draw from a distribution with a known mean of zero and variance 
cr2^, where ofsk is the true variance. The square of this error, el k, is thus under this 
assumption an unbiased estimate of <72,. One therefore has two estimates of cr2 one 
computed from the mean prediction error and one computed by stochastic simulation. 
Let disk denote the difference between these two estimates:
dM = ^sk-^sk- 
<14'6)
If it is further assumed that dr2, exactly equals the true value (that is, <5 2, = cr2,), then 
disk is the difference between the estimated variance based on the mean prediction error 
and the true variance. Therefore, under the two assumptions of no error in the stochastic­
simulation estimates, the expected value of disk is zero for a correctly specified model.
If a model is misspecified, it is not in general true that the expected value of disk is 
zero. If the model is misspecified, the estimated residuals that are used for the draws are 
inconsistent estimates of the true errors and the coefficient estimates obtained on each 
trial are inconsistent estimates of the true coefficients. The effect of misspecification on 
disk is ambiguous, although if data mining has occurred in that the estimated residuals 
are on average too small in absolute value, the mean of disk is likely to be positive. 
In other words, if data mining has occurred, the stochastic-simulation estimates of the 
variances are likely to be too small because they are based on draws from estimated 
residuals that are too small in absolute value. In addition, if the model is misspecified, 
the outside sample prediction errors are likely to be large on average, which suggests a 
positive mean for the dlsk values.
The procedure described so far uses only one estimation period and one prediction 
period, where the estimation period ends in period 5 — 1 and the prediction period 
begins in period 5. It results in one value of disk for each variable i and each length 
ahead k. Since one observation is obviously not adequate for estimating the mean of 
disk, more observations must be generated. This can be done by using successively 
new estimation periods and new prediction periods. Assume, for example, that one 
has data from period 1 through period 150. The model can be estimated through, say, 

172
14 || Model Comparisons
period 100, with the prediction beginning with period 101. Stochastic simulation for the 
prediction period will yield for each i and k a value of dj 101^ in equation 14.6. The model 
can then be reestimated through period 101, with the prediction period now beginning 
with period 102. Stochastic simulation for this prediction period will yield for each 
i and k a value of diW2k. This process can be repeated through the estimation period 
ending with period 149. For the one-period-ahead prediction (k — 1) the procedure will 
yield for each variable i 50 values of disi (s = 101, . . ., 150); for the two-period-ahead 
prediction (k = 2) it will yield 49 values of djs2, (s = 101, . . . , 149); and so on.
The final step in the process is to make an assumption about the mean of disk 
that allows the computed values of djsk to be used to estimate the mean. A variety 
of assumptions, discussed in Fair (1984), Chapter 8, are possible. The assumption 
made for the work in this section is that the mean is constant across time. In other 
words, misspecification is assumed to affect the mean in the same way for all s. Given 
this assumption, the mean, denoted as djk, can be estimated by merely averaging the 
computed values of disk.
Given dik, an estimate of the total variance of the prediction error, denoted d^tk, is:

Values of the square root of are presented in the d tqsn in Table 11.3. In 
calculating the values of djsk, the first estimation period ended in 1982:4, the second in 
1983:1, and the 79th in 2002:2. This gave 79 values of dis[, 73 values of dis2, and so 
on through 72 values of Jzv8. dik is thus the mean of 79 values, d2k is the mean of 78 
values, and so on. Each value in the d row is the square root of the sum of the square 
of the value in the b row and dik. The number of trials for each of the 79 stochastic 
simulations was 100. (As noted above, the number of trials used to get the a row values 
was 2,000, and likewise for the b row values.) Remember that each trial consists of a 
new set of coefficient estimates (except for the a row values).
Table 14.3 shows that the differences between the d and b rows are generally 
fairly small. This suggests that the US model is not seriously misspecified. The largest 
difference is for the eight-quarter-ahead prediction of GDPD, where the standard 
deviation is 0.92 in the b row and 1.78 in the d row. For real GDP the eight-quarter- 
ahead b and d row values are 1.77 and 1.68, respectively. For the unemployment rate 
the two values are 0.93 and 0.53, and for the bill rate the values are 1.45 and 1.86.
14.8 Conclusion
As noted in the Introduction, the results in this chapter are consistent with previous 
results. The US model generally does well against time-series models. There is little 
information in predictions from times-series models that is not in predictions from the 
US model.

15
Conclusion
The main empirical results in this book are as follows.
The U.S. Economy in the 1990s
Chapter 5 shows that there is a standard wealth effect in the US model. The end-of- 
sample tests for the US equations in Chapters 2 and 6 accept the hypothesis of stability 
for all the main equations except the stock price equation. The experiment in Chapter 
6 shows that had there been no stock market boom in the last half of the 1990s the U.S. 
economy would not have looked historically unusual. The unusual features were driven 
by the wealth effect and cost-of-capital effect from the stock market boom. Nothing in 
the profit and productivity data that are discussed in Chapter 6 suggests that there should 
have been a stock market boom, and so the stock market boom appears to be a puzzle.
Price Equations
The tests in Chapter 4 generally reject the NAIRU dynamics. They also show that 
there is some loss in the movement away from the estimation of structural price and 
wage equations to the estimation of reduced-form price equations. The rejection of the 
NAIRU dynamics has important implications for long-run properties, since the NAIRU 
dynamics imply that the price level accelerates if the unemployment rate is held below 
the NAIRU. This is not true of the dynamics of the price and wage equations of the 
MC model. It is argued in Chapter 4, however, that the linear specification of all these 
equations is not likely to be accurate for low values of the unemployment rate. It seems 
likely that as the unemployment rate falls there is some value below which a further fall 
leads to a nonlinear response of prices. Unfortunately, it is not possible to estimate this 
nonlinearity, because there are too few observations of very low unemployment rates. 
This means that models like the MC model should not be pushed into areas of very low 
unemployment rates.
173

174
15 || Conclusion
The estimates in Chapter 8 of European inflation costs in the 1980s from a more 
expansionary monetary policy are not likely to be affected by the nonlinearity issue, 
because the experiment is over a period of fairly high unemployment rates. The esti­
mates show that going out nine years, the unemployment rate in Germany could have 
been lowered by over one percentage point with an inflation cost of about 0.6 percent­
age points. This is a trade-off that many people probably would have accepted at the 
time, had they believed that a trade-off was possible. Anyone who accepted the NAIRU 
dynamics (see the beginning of section 8.1) would not, of course, have believed that 
there was any trade-off.
Monetary Policy
Many of the results in this book pertain to monetary policy. Interest rate rules are 
estimated in Chapter 2 for each of the main countries. The first version of the US 
rule, equation 30, was estimated in 1978. The tests of this rule accept the hypothesis 
of coefficient stability both before and after the early Volcker regime, 1979:4-1982:3, 
when the Fed announced that it was targeting monetary aggregates rather than interest 
rates. The long-run inflation coefficient in the estimated rule is almost exactly one. 
The U.S. interest rate appears as an explanatory variable in many of the interest rate 
rules of the other countries, and the German interest rate appears as an explanatory 
variable in many of the interest rate rules of the other European countries (before 
1999:1).
The effects of nominal versus real interest rates in consumption and investment equa­
tions are tested in Chapter 3, and the results strongly support the use of nominal interest 
rates. Nominal interest rates are used in the MC model except for the US investment 
equation 12. The experiment in Chapter 7 shows that a positive U.S. inflation shock 
with the nominal interest rate held constant is contractionary in the MC model. This is 
opposite to the property of modern-view models, where the shock is expansionary. The 
shock is expansionary in modern-view models because the real interest rate falls and 
demand responds positively to real interest rate decreases. The shock is contractionary 
in the MC model, because real income and real wealth fall, which contracts demand, 
and because there is no positive effect from the fall in the real interest rate except for 
the US investment equation.
This difference between the MC model and modern-view models has important 
implications for interest rate rules. In modern-view models the coefficient on inflation 
in the interest rate rule must be greater than one for the model to be stable, whereas 
in the MC model the coefficient can even be zero and the model stable. The results 
in Chapter 11 show that a rule with a coefficient of zero is stabilizing. The monetary - 
policy implications of modern-view models are thus sensitive to their use of the real 
interest rate and their lack of real income and real wealth effects. If the models are 
not adequately specified in this regard, their monetary-policy implications may not be 
trustworthy.

EMU Stabilization Costs
Chapter 12 probably pushes the MC model about as far as it should be pushed. Condi­
tional on the estimated interest rate rules for Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, 
and the United Kingdom, it estimates the stabilization costs of the first four countries 
joining a common-currency area and then all five. Germany is by far the most hurt, but 
Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom are also hurt. France is helped. The 
estimated interest rate rule for France is not stabilizing (the Bank of France mostly just 
followed what Germany did), and France actually gains when it is part of a larger rule 
that is stabilizing. Germany is hurt a great deal because its individual interest rate rule is 
quite stabilizing. Although the results in Chapter 12 are preliminary, the analysis shows 
that stochastic simulation and the MC model can be used to try to answer a quite broad 
stabilization question.
Bootstrapping
The results in Chapter 9 show that the bootstrap appears to work well for the US 
model. They also show that in general the use of asymptotic distributions does not 
appear to be highly misleading. The asymptotic intervals are slightly too narrow, and 
the use of the AP asymptotic distribution rejects the hypothesis of stability somewhat 
too often. The one area where the asymptotic distributions are not very accurate is 
in testing the NAIRU dynamics in Chapter 4. A Monte Carlo technique is needed in 
this case.
For all the stochastic simulations in this book the error draws have been from 
estimated residuals rather than from estimated distributions. In addition, if coefficient 
estimate uncertainty is taken into account, this has been done by reestimating the model 
on each trial rather than by drawing from estimated distributions of the coefficient 
estimates. This is a change from the stochastic simulation work in Fair (1984, 1994), 
and it is in spirit of the bootstrap methodology discussed in Chapter 9.
Certainty Equivalence and Optimal Control
The results in Chapter 10 show that little is lost in using the certainty equivalence 
assumption in the solution of optimal control problems for nonlinear models like the 
US model. This is an important practical result, since it allows optimal control problems 
to be solved in Chapters 11 and 13 that would otherwise not be computationally 
feasible.
The optimal control experiments in Chapter 11 show that the estimated rule, equa­
tion 30, gives results that are similar to the Fed’s minimizing a loss function in output 
and inflation in which the weight on inflation deviations is about five times the weight 
on output deviations. The results in Chapter 11 also show that a tax-rate rule would be 
of help in stabilizing the economy.

176
15 || Conclusion
Rational Expectations
The single-equations tests of the rational expectations hypothesis generally reject the 
hypothesis. If expectations are not rational, the Lucas critique is not likely to be a 
problem, and one can have more confidence in the policy properties of the MC model, 
which does not impose rational expectations, than otherwise. If, however, one wants 
to impose rational expectations on a model, the results in Chapter 13 show that it is 
computationally feasible to analyze even large-scale versions of these models, including 
the use of stochastic simulation and the solution of optimal control problems.
Testing Equations and Models
The single-equation tests are generally supportive of the specifications, although there 
are obviously some weak equations, especially for the smaller countries. The complete­
model tests in Chapter 14 show that the US model dominates time-series models, results 
that are consistent with earlier work. There are two approaches in future work that can 
be taken to try to improve accuracy. One is to work within the general framework of the 
MC model, testing alternative individual-equation specifications as more data become 
available. Alternative estimation techniques can also be tried. The other approach is 
to begin with a different framework, say one that relies heavily on the assumption of 
rational expectations or one that has features of the modern-view model discussed in 
Chapter 7, and develop and test a completely different model. If this is done, tests like 
those in Chapter 14 can be used to compare different models.
The currently popular approach in macroeconomics of working with calibrated 
models does not focus on either single-equation tests or complete-model tests, which 
leaves the field somewhat in limbo. Calibrated models are unlikely to do well in the 
tests stressed in this book simply because they are not designed to explain aggregate 
time-series data well. If in the long run the aim is to explain how the macroeconomy 
works, these models will need to become empirical enough to be tested, both equation 
by equation and against time-series models and structural models like the MC model.

The US Model
A.l About Tables A.1-A.10
The tables that pertain to the US model are presented in this appendix. Table A.l 
presents the six sectors in the US model: household (h), firm (/), financial (b\ foreign 
(r), federal government (g), and state and local government (5). In order to account for 
the flow of funds among these sectors and for their balance-sheet constraints, the U.S. 
Flow of Funds Accounts (FFA) and the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts 
(NIPA) must be linked. Many of the identities in the US model are concerned with this 
linkage. Table A.l shows how the six sectors in the US model are related to the sectors 
in the FFA. The notation on the right side of this table (Hl, FA, etc.) is used in Table A.5 
in the description of the FFA data.
Table A.2 lists all the variables in the US model in alphabetical order, and Ta­
ble A.3 lists all the stochastic equations and identities. The functional forms of the 
stochastic equations are given in Table A.3, but not the coefficient estimates. The 
coefficient estimates are presented in Table A.4, where within this table the coeffi­
cient estimates and tests for equation 1 are presented in Table Al, for equation 2 
in Table A2, and so on. The results in Table A.4 are discussed in the text in sec­
tion 2.3.
The remaining tables provide more detailed information about the model. Ta­
bles A.5-A.7 show how the variables were constructed from the raw data. Table A.8 
shows how the model is solved under various assumptions about monetary pol­
icy. Table A.9 lists the first-stage regressors per equation that were used for the 
2SLS estimates. Finally, Table A. 10 shows which variables appear in which equa­
tions.
The rest of this appendix discusses the collection of the data and the construction 
of some of the variables.

A.2 The Raw Data
The NIPA Data
The variables from the NIPA are presented first in Table A.5, in the order in which they 
appear in the Survey of Current Business. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) 
is now emphasizing “chain-type weights” in the construction of real magnitudes, and 
the data based on these weights have been used here.1 Because of the use of chain-type 
weights, real GDP is not the sum of its real components. To handle this, a discrepancy 
variable, denoted STATP, was created, which is the difference between real GDP and 
the sum of its real components. (STATP is constructed using equation 83 in Table A.3.) 
STATP is small in magnitude, and it is taken to be exogenous in the model.
1. See Young (1992) and Triplett (1992) for good discussions of chain-type weights.
The Other Data
The variables from the FFA are presented next in Table A.5, ordered by their code 
numbers. Some of these variables are NIPA variables that are not published in the Survey 
of Current Business but that are needed to link the two accounts. Interest rate variables 
are presented next in the table, followed by employment and population variables. The 
source for the interest rate data is the website of the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System (BOG). The source for the employment and population data is the 
website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Some of the employment data are 
unpublished data from the BLS, and these are indicated as such in the table. Data on 
the armed forces are not published by the BLS, and these data were computed from 
population data from the U.S. Census Bureau.
Adjustments that were made to the raw data are presented next in Table A.5. These 
are explained beginning in the next paragraph. Finally, all the raw data variables are 
presented at the end of Table A.5 in alphabetical order along with their numbers. This 
allows one to find a raw data variable quickly. All the raw data variables are numbered 
with an “R” in front of the number to distinguish them from the variables in the model.
The adjustments that were made to the raw data are as follows. The quarterly social 
insurance variables R249-R254 were constructed from the annual variables R78-R83 
and the quarterly variables R40, R60, and R71. Only annual data are available on the 
breakdown of social insurance contributions between the federal and the state and local 
governments with respect to the categories “personal,” “government employer,” and 
“other employer.” It is thus necessary to construct the quarterly variables using the 
annual data. It is implicitly assumed in this construction that as employers, state and 
local governments do not contribute to the federal government and vice versa.
The constructed tax variables R255 and R256 pertain to the breakdown of corporate 
profit taxes of the financial sector between federal and state and local. Data on this 
breakdown do not exist. It is implicitly assumed in this construction that the breakdown 
is the same as it is for the total corporate sector.

A.3 || Variable Construction
181
The quarterly variable R257, INTPRI, which is the level of net interest payments 
of sole proprietorships and partnerships, is constructed from the annual variable R86, 
INTPRIA, and the quarterly and annual data on PII, personal interest income, R53. 
Quarterly data on net interest payments of sole proprietorships and partnerships do not 
exist. It is implicitly assumed in the construction of the quarterly data that the quarterly 
pattern of the level of interest payments of sole proprietorships and partnerships is the 
same as the quarterly pattern of personal interest income.
The quarterly variable R258, INTROW, which is the level of net interest payments 
of the rest of the world, is constructed from the annual variable R87, INTROWA, and 
the quarterly and annual data on PII, personal interest income, R53. Quarterly data on 
net interest payments of the rest of the world do not exist. It is implicitly assumed in 
the construction of the quarterly data that the quarterly pattern of the level of interest 
payments of the rest of the world is the same as the quarterly pattern of personal interest 
income.
The tax variables R57 and R62 were adjusted to account for the tax surcharge of 
1968:3-1970:3 and the tax rebate of 1975:2. The tax surcharge and the tax rebate were 
taken out of personal income taxes (TPG) and put into personal transfer payments 
(TRGH). The tax surcharge numbers were taken from Okun (1971), table 1, p. 171. 
The tax rebate was 7.8 billion dollars at a quarterly rate.
The employment and population data from the BLS are rebenchmarked from time 
to time, and the past data are not adjusted to the new benchmarks. Presented next 
in Table A.5 are the adjustments that were made to obtain consistent series. These 
adjustments take the form of various “multiplication factors” for the old data. For the 
period in question and for a particular variable the old data are multiplied by the relevant 
multiplication factor to create data for use in the model. The variables TPOP90 and 
TPOP99 listed in Table A.5 are used to phase out multiplication factors.
Table A.6 presents the balance-sheet constraints that the data satisfy. The variables 
in this table are raw data variables. The equations in the table provide the main checks 
on the collection of the data. If any of the checks is not met, one or more errors have 
been made in the collection process. Although the checks in the table may look easy, 
considerable work is involved in meeting them. All the receipts from sector i to sector j 
must be determined for all i and j (z and j run from 1 through 6).
A.3 Variable Construction
Table A.7 presents the construction of the variables in the model (that is, the variables 
in Table A.2) from the raw data variables (that is, the variables in Table A.5). With a few 
exceptions, the variables in the model are either constructed in terms of the raw data 
variables in Table A.5 or are constructed by identities. If the variable is constructed by 
an identity, the notation “Def., Eq.” appears, where the equation number is the identity 
in Table A.3 that constructs the variable. In a few cases the identity that constructs an 
endogenous variable is not the equation that determines it in the model. For example, 
equation 85 constructs LM, whereas stochastic equation 8 determines LM in the model.

182
Appendix A || The US Model
Equation 85 instead determines E, E being constructed directly from raw data variables. 
Also, some of the identities construct exogenous variables. For example, the exogenous 
variable DIG is constructed by equation 49. In the model equation 49 determines TFG, 
TFG being constructed directly from raw data variables. If a variable in the model is 
the same as a raw data variable, the same notation is used for both except that variables 
in the model are in italics and raw data variables are not. For example, consumption 
expenditures on durable goods is CD as a raw data variable and CD as a variable in the 
model.
The financial stock variables in the model that are constructed from flow identities 
need a base quarter and a base quarter starting value. The base quarter values are 
indicated in Table A.7. The base quarter was taken to be 1971:4, and the stock values 
for this quarter were taken from the FFA stock values.
There are also a few internal checks on the data in Table A.7 (aside from the balance­
sheet checks in Table A.6). The variables for which there are both raw data and an 
identity available are GDP, MB, PIEF, PUG, and PUS. In addition, the saving variables 
in Table A.6 (SH, SF, and so on) must match the saving variables of the same name in 
Table A.7. There is also one redundant equation in the model, equation 80, which the 
variables must satisfy.
There are a few variables in Table A.7 whose construction needs some explanation.
HFS: Peak-to-Peak Interpolation of HF
HFS is a peak-to-peak interpolation of HF, hours per job. The peaks are listed in 
Table A.7. “Flat end” in the table means that the interpolation line was taken to be 
horizontal from the last peak listed on. The deviation of HF from HFS, which is variable 
HFF in the model, is used in equation 15, which explains overtime hours. HFS is also 
used in equations 13 and 14.
HO-. Overtime Hours
Data are not available for HO, overtime hours, for the first 16 quarters of the sample 
period (1952:1-1955:4). The equation that explains HO in the model has log HO on the 
left-hand side and the constant term, HFF, and HFF lagged once on the right-hand side. 
The equation is also estimated under the assumption of a first-order autoregressive error 
term. The missing data for HO were constructed by estimating the log HO equation for 
the 1956:1-2002:3 period and using the predicted values from this regression for the 
(outside sample) 1952:3-1955:4 period as the actual data. The values for 1952:1 and 
1952:2 were taken to be the 1952:3 predicted value.
TAUS: Progressivity Tax Parameter—s
TAUS is the progressivity tax parameter in the personal income tax equation for state 
and local governments (equation 48). It was obtained as follows. The sample pe­
riod 1952:1-2002:3 was divided into four subperiods, 1952:1-1970:4, 1971:1-1971:4, 
1972:1-2001:4, and 2002:1-2002:3. These were judged from a plot of THS/YT, the 

A.3 || Variable Construction
183
ratio of state and local personal income taxes (THS) to taxable income (YT), to be 
periods of no large tax law changes. Two assumptions were then made about the rela­
tionship between THS and YT. The first is that within a subperiod THS/POP equals 
[DI + TAUS(YT/POP)}(YT/POP) plus a random error term, where DI and TAUS are 
constants. The second is that changes in the tax laws affect DI but not TAUS. These 
two assumptions led to the estimation of an equation with THS/POP on the left-hand 
side and the constant term, DUM\(YT / POP), DUM2(YT/POP), DUM3(YT/POP), 
DUMA(YT/POP), and (YT/POP)1 on the right-hand side, where DUMi is a dummy 
variable that takes on a value of one in subperiod i and zero otherwise. (The estima­
tion period was 1952:1-2002:3 excluding 1987:2. The observation for 1987:2 was 
excluded because it corresponded to a large outlier.) The estimate of the coefficient 
of DUMi(YT/POP) is an estimate of DI for subperiod i. The estimate of the coeffi­
cient of (YT/POP)1 is the estimate of TAUS. The estimate of TAUS was .00153, with a 
^-statistic of 31.76. This procedure is, of course, crude, but at least it provides a rough 
estimate of the progressivity of the state and local personal income tax system.
Given TAUS, D\S is defined to be THS/YT - (TAUS ■ YT)/POP (see Table A.7). 
In the model DIS is taken to be exogenous, and THS is explained by equation 48 as 
[DIS' + (TAUS ■ YT)/POP]YT. This treatment allows a state and local marginal tax rate 
to be defined in equation 91: D\SM = DIS + (2 • TAUS ■ YT)/POP.
TAUG: Progressivity Tax Parameter—g
TAUG is the progressivity tax parameter in the personal income tax equation for 
the federal government (equation 47). The estimation procedure for TAUG was 
similar to that followed above for TAUS, where 37 subperiods where chosen. The
37 subperiods are: 1952:1-1953:4, 1954:1-1963:4, 1964:1-1964:4, 1965:1-1965:4, 
1966:1-1967:4, 
1968:1-1970:4, 1971:1-1971:4, 
1972:1-1972:4, 1973:1-1973:4,
1974:1-1975:1, 
1975:2-1976:4, 1977:1-1977:1, 
1977:2-1978:2, 1978:3-1981:3,
1981:4-1982:2, 
1982:3-1983:2, 1983:3-1984:4, 
1985:1-1985:1, 1985:2-1985:2,
1985:3-1987:1, 
1987:2-1987:2, 1987:3-1987:4, 
1988:1-1988:4, 1989:1-1989:4,
1990:1-1990:4, 
1991:1-1993:4, 1994:1-1996:1, 
1996:2-1996:2, 1996:3-1997:2,
1997:3-1997:4, 
1998:1-1999:4, 2000:1-2001:2, 2001:3-2001:3, 2001:4-2001:4,
2002:1-2002:1, 2002:2-2002:2, and 2002:3-2002:3. The estimate of TAUG was 
.00811, with a t-statistic of 9.02. Again, this procedure is crude, but it provides a 
rough estimate of the progressivity of the federal personal income tax system.
Given TAUG, D\G is defined to be THG/YT - (TAUG • YT)/POP (see Table A.7).
In the model DIG is taken to be exogenous, and THG is explained by equation 47 as 
[DIG + (TAUG • YT)/POP]YT. This treatment allows a federal marginal tax rate to be 
defined in equation 90: D\GM = DIG + (2 • TAUG • YT)/POP.
KD: Stock of Durable Goods
KD is an estimate of the stock of durable goods. It is defined by equation 58:
KD = (1 - DELD)KD_X + CD.
(58)

184
Appendix A || The US Model
Given quarterly observations for CD, which are available from the NIPA, quarterly 
observations for KD can be constructed once a base-quarter value and values for the 
depreciation rate DELD are chosen. End-of-year estimates of the stock of durable goods 
are available from 1929 through 2001 from the BEA. Estimates for 1991-2001 are in 
table 15, p. 37, of the Survey of Current Business, September 2002. Estimates for earlier 
years are available from the BEA website. These numbers are in 1996 dollars. Given 
the value of KD at the end of 1952 and given quarterly values of CD for 1953:1-1953:4, 
a value of DELD can be computed such that the predicted value from equation 58 for 
1953:4 matches within a prescribed tolerance level the published BEA value for the end 
of 1953. This value of DELD can then be used to compute quarterly values of KD for 
1953:1, 1953:2, and 1953:3. This process can be repeated for each year, which results 
in a quarterly series for KD. (The value of DELD computed between 2000 and 2001 
was used to create values of KD for 2002:1, 2002:2, and 2002:3.)
KH: Stock of Housing
KH is an estimate of the stock of housing of the household sector. It is defined by 
equation 59:
KH = (1 - DELH)KH_{ + IHH. 
(59)
The same procedure was followed for estimating DELH as was followed for estimating 
DELD. The housing stock data are available from the above BEA references for 
the durable goods stock data. The BEA residential stock data is for total residential 
investment, which in the model is IHH + IHK + IHB, whereas equation 59 pertains 
only to the residential investment of the household sector (IHH). The procedure that 
was used for dealing with this difference is as follows. First, the values for DELH 
were chosen using total residential investment as the investment series, since this 
series matched the published stock data. Second, once the values of DELH were 
chosen, KH was constructed using IHH (not total residential investment). A base­
quarter value of KH of 1729.4 in 1952:1 was used. This value is .806 times the computed 
value for total residential investment for 1952:1. The value .806 is the average of 
IHH/(IHH + IHK + IHB) over the sample period.
KK: Stock of Capital
KK is an estimate of the stock of capital of the firm sector. It is determined by 
equation 92:
KK = (1 - DELK)KK_{ + IKF. 
(92)
The same procedure was followed for estimating DELK as was followed for estimating 
DELD and DELH. The capital stock data are available from the above BEA references 
for the other stock data. The BEA capital stock data is for total fixed nonresidential 
investment, which in the model is IKF + IKH + IKB + IKG, whereas equation 59 
pertains only to the fixed nonresidential investment of the firm sector (IKF). The 

A.3 || Variable Construction
185
procedure for dealing with this was similar to that followed above for residential 
investment. First, the values for DELK were chosen using total fixed nonresidential 
investment as the investment series, since this series matched the published stock data. 
Second, once the values of DELK were chosen, KK was constructed using IKF (not 
total fixed nonresidential investment). A base-quarter value of KK of 1803.8 in 1952:1 
was used. This value is .887 times the computed value for total fixed nonresidential 
investment for 1952:1. The value .887 is the average of IKF/(IKF + IKH + IKB + 
IKG) over the sample period.
V: Stock of Inventories
V is the stock of inventories of the firm sector (that is, the nonfarm stock). By definition, 
inventory investment (IVF) is equal to the change in the stock, which is equation 117:
/VF=V-V_1. 
(117)
Both data on V and IVF are published in the Survey of Current Business, the data on V 
in Table 5.13. For present purposes V was constructed from the formula V = V_1 + IVF 
using the IVF series and base-quarter value of 1251.9 in 1996:4. This is the value in 
Table 5.13 in the National Income and Product Accounts.
Excess Labor and Excess Capital
In the theoretical model the amounts of excess labor and excess capital on hand affect 
the decisions of firms. In order to test for this in the empirical work, one needs to 
estimate the amounts of excess labor and capital on hand in each period. This in turn 
requires an estimate of the technology of the firm sector.
The measurement of the capital stock KK is discussed above. The production 
function of the firm sector for empirical purposes is postulated to be
Y— m\n[LAM(JF • HFa), MU(KK • HKa)], 
(A.l)
where Y is production, JF is the number of workers employed, HFa is the number of 
hours worked per worker, KK is the capital stock discussed above, HKa is the number 
of hours each unit of KK is utilized, and LAM and MU are coefficients that may change 
over time due to technical progress. The variables Y, JF, and KK are observed; the 
others are not. For example, data on the number of hours paid for per worker, HF in 
the model, exist, but not on the number of hours actually worked per worker, HFa.
Equation 92 for KK and the production function A.l are not consistent with the 
putty-clay technology of the theoretical model. To be precise with this technology one 
has to keep track of the purchase date of each machine and its technological coefficients. 
This kind of detail is not possible with aggregate data, and one must resort to simpler 
specifications.
Given the production function A.l, excess labor is measured as follows. The log 
of output per paid-for worker hour, log[T/(JF • HF)], is first plotted for the 1952:1— 
2002:3 period. The peaks of this series are then assumed to correspond to cases in 

186
Appendix A || The US Model
which the capital constraint in the production function A. 1 is not binding and in which 
the number of hours worked equals the number of hours paid for. This implies that the 
values of LAM are observed at the peaks. The values of log LAM other than those at 
the peaks are assumed to lie on straight lines between the peaks. This allows LAM to 
be computed for each quarter.
Since LAM is a measure of potential productivity, an interesting question is how it 
grows over time. This is discussed in section 6.4, where the plot of log[F/(JF • HF)} is 
presented in Figure 6.16a. This plot shows that LAM grew more rapidly in the 1950s and 
1960s than it has since. It also shows that the growth rate after 1995 was only slightly 
larger than before.
Coming back to the measurement of excess labor, given an estimate of LAM for a 
particular quarter and given equation A. 1, the estimate of the number of worker hours 
required to produce the output of the quarter, denoted JHMIN in the model, is simply 
Y/LAM. This is equation 94 in Table A.3. The actual number of worker hours paid for, 
JF • HF, can be compared with JHMIN to measure the amount of excess labor on hand. 
The peaks that were used for the interpolations are listed in Table A.7 in the description 
of LAM.
For the measurement of excess capital there are no data on hours paid for or worked 
per unit of KK, and thus one must be content with plotting Y/KK. This is, from the 
production function A.l, a plot of MU • HKa, where HKa is the average number of 
hours that each machine is utilized. If it is assumed that at each peak of this series the 
labor constraint in the production function A.l is not binding and that HKa is equal 
to the same constant, say H, then one observes at the peaks MU • H. Interpolation 
between peaks can then produce a complete series on MU ■ H. If, finally, H is assumed 
to be the maximum number of hours per quarter that each unit of KK can be utilized, 
then Y/(MU • H) is the minimum amount of capital required to produce Y, denoted 
KKMIN. In the model, MU • H is denoted MUH, and the equation determining KKMIN 
is equation 93 in Table A.4. The actual capital stock (KK) can be compared with KKMIN 
to measure the amount of excess capital on hand. The peaks that were used for the 
interpolations are listed in Table A.7 in the description of MUH. “Flat beginning” in the 
table means that the interpolation line was taken to be horizontal from the beginning of 
the period to the first peak listed. As noted above, “flat end” means that the interpolation 
line was taken to be horizontal from the last peak listed on.
YS: Potential Output of the Firm Sector
KS1, a measure of the potential output of the firm sector, is defined by equation 98:
YS — LAM(JJP ■ POP — JG • HG — JM ■ HM — JS • HS). (98)
JJP is the peak or potential ratio of worker hours to population. It is constructed from 
a peak-to-peak interpolation of JJ, where JJ is the actual ratio of the total number 
of worker hours paid for in the economy to the total population aged 16 and over 
(equation 95). JJP ■ POP is thus the potential number of worker hours. The terms that 
are subtracted from JJP • POP in equation 98 are, in order, the number of federal civilian 

A.4 || The Identities
187
worker hours, the number of federal military worker hours, and the number of state and 
local government worker hours. The entire number in parentheses is thus the potential 
number of worker hours in the firm sector. LAM is the coefficient LAM in the production 
function A. 1. Since YS in equation 98 is LAM times the potential number of workers 
in the firm sector, it can be interpreted as the potential output of the firm sector unless 
the capital input is insufficient to produce YS. This construction of YS is thus based on 
the assumption that there is always sufficient capital on hand to produce YS.
A.4 The Identities
The identities in Table A.3 are of two types. One type simply defines one variable 
in terms of others. These identities are equations 31, 33, 34, 43, 55, 56, 58-87, and 
89-131. The other type defines one variable as a rate or ratio multiplied by another 
variable or set of variables, where the rate or ratio has been constructed to have the 
identity hold. These identities are equations 32, 35-42, 44-54, and 57. Consider, for 
example, equation 50:
TFS = D2S • PIEF, 
(50)
where TFS is the amount of corporate profit taxes paid from firms (sector/) to the 
state and local government sector (sector 5), PIEF is the level of corporate profits of 
the firm sector, and D2S is the “tax rate.” Data exist for TFS and PIEF, and D2S was 
constructed as TFS/PIEF. The variable D2S is then interpreted as a tax rate and is taken 
to be exogenous. This rate, of course, varies over time as tax laws and other things that 
affect the relationship between TFS and PIEF change, but no attempt has been made 
to explain these changes. This general procedure was followed for the other identities 
involving tax rates.
A similar procedure was followed to handle relative price changes. Consider equa­
tion 38:
PIH = PSI5 ■ PD, 
(38)
where PIH is the price deflator for residential investment, PD is the price deflator for 
total domestic sales, and PSI5 is a ratio. Data exist for PIH and PD, and PSI5 was 
constructed as PIH/PD. PSI5, which varies over time as the relationship between PIH 
and PD changes, is taken to be exogenous. This procedure was followed for the other 
identities involving prices and wages. This treatment means that relative prices and 
relative wages are exogenous in the model. (Prices relative to wages are not exogenous, 
however.) It is beyond the scope of the model to explain relative prices and wages, and 
the foregoing treatment is a simple way of handling these changes.
Another identity of the second type is equation 57:
BR = -G\ MB, 
(57)
where BR is the level of bank reserves, MB is the net value of demand deposits of the 
financial sector, and GT is a “reserve requirement ratio.” Data on BR and MB exist, and 

188
Appendix A || The US Model
G1 were constructed as —BR/MB. (MB is negative, since the financial sector is a net 
debtor with respect to demand deposits, and so the minus sign makes (71 positive.) (71 
is taken to be exogenous. It varies over time as actual reserve requirements and other 
features that affect the relationship between BR and MB change.
Many of the identities of the first type are concerned with linking the FFA data to 
the NIPA data. An identity like equation 66,
0 = SH - AAH - AMH + CG - DISH, 
(66)
is concerned with this linkage. SH is from the NIPA, and the other variables are from 
the FFA. The discrepancy variable, DISH, which is from the FFA, reconciles the two 
data sets. Equation 66 states that any nonzero value of saving of the household sector 
must result in a change in AH or MH. There are equations like 66 for each of the 
other five sectors: equation 70 for the firm sector, 73 for the financial sector, 75 for 
the foreign sector, 77 for the federal government sector, and 79 for the state and local 
government sector. Equation 77, for example, is the budget constraint of the federal 
government sector. Note also from Table A.3 that the saving of each sector (SH, SF, 
etc.) is determined by an identity. The sum of the saving variables across the six sectors 
is zero, which is the reason that equation 80 is redundant.

Note:
• The variables in the first column are the variables in the model. They are defined by the identities 
in Table A.3 or by the raw data variables in Table A.5. A right-hand-side variable in this table is a 
raw data variable unless it is in italics, in which case it is a variable in the model. Sometimes the 
same letters are used for both a variable in the model and a raw data variable.

Table A.8
Solution of the Model under Alternative Monetary Assumptions
There are five possible assumptions that can be made with respect to monetary policy in the US 
model. In the standard version monetary policy is endogenous; it is explained by equation 30— 
the interest rate rule. Under alternative assumptions, where monetary policy is exogenous, 
equation 30 is dropped and some of the other equations are rearranged for purposes of solving 
the model. For example, in the standard version equation 125 is used to solve for the level of 
nonborrowed reserves, UBR\
UBR=BR — BO. 
(125)
When, however, the level of nonborrowed reserves is set exogenously, the equation is rear­
ranged and used to solve for total bank reserves, BR:
BR = UBR+BO. 
(125)
The following shows the arrangement of the equations for each of the five monetary policy 
assumptions. The variable listed is the one that is put on the left-hand side of the equation and 
“solved for.”

About Tables B.1-B.6
The tables that pertain to the ROW model are presented in this appendix. Table B.l 
lists the countries in the model. The 38 countries for which structural equations are 
estimated are Canada (CA) through Peru (PE). Countries 40 through 59 are coun­
tries for which only trade share equations are estimated. The countries that make 
up the EMU are listed at the bottom of Table B.l. The EMU is denoted EU in the 
model.
A detailed description of the variables per country is presented in Table B.2, where 
the variables are listed in alphabetical order. Data permitting, each of the countries 
has the same set of variables. Quarterly data were collected for countries 2 through 
14, and annual data were collected for the others. Countries 2 through 14 will be 
referred to as “quarterly” countries, and the others will be referred to as “annual” 
countries. The way in which each variable was constructed is explained in brackets 
in Table B.2. All of the data with potential seasonal fluctuations have been seasonally 
adjusted.
Table B.3 lists the stochastic equations and the identities. The functional forms of 
the stochastic equations are given, but not the coefficient estimates. The coefficient es­
timates for all the countries are presented in Table B.4, where within this table the 
coefficient estimates and tests for equation 1 are presented in Table Bl, for equa­
tion 2 in Table B2, and so on. The results in Table B.4 are discussed in section 2.4. 
Table B.3 also lists the equations that pertain to the trade and price links among the 
countries, and it explains how the quarterly and annual data are linked for the trade 
share calculations. Table B.5 lists the links between the US and ROW models, and 
Table B.6 explains the construction of the balance-of-payments data—data for vari­
ables S and TT.
The rest of this appendix discusses the collection of the data and the construction 
of some of the variables.

Appendix B || The ROW Model
B.2 
The Raw Data
The data sets for the countries other than the United States (that is, the countries in 
the ROW model) begin in 1960. The sources of the data are the IMF and the OECD. 
Data from the IMF are international financial statistics (IFS) data and direction of trade 
(DOT) data. Data from the OECD are quarterly national accounts data, annual national 
accounts data, quarterly labor force data, and annual labor force data. These are the 
“raw” data. As noted above, the way in which each variable was constructed is explained 
in brackets in Table B.2. When “IFS” precedes a number or letter in the table, this refers 
to the IFS variable number or letter. Some variables were constructed directly from IFS 
and OECD data (that is, directly from the raw data), and some were constructed from 
other (already constructed) variables. The construction of the EU variables is listed near 
the end of Table B.2.
B.3 
Variable Construction
S, TT, and A: Balance-of-Payments Variables
One important feature of the data collection is the linking of the balance-of-payments 
data to the other export and import data. The two key variables involved in this process 
are S, the balance of payments on current account, and TT, the value of net transfers. 
The construction of these variables and the linking of the two types of data are explained 
in Table B.6. Quarterly balance-of-payments data do not generally begin as early as the 
other data, and the procedure in Table B.6 allows quarterly data on S to be constructed 
as far back as the beginning of the quarterly data for merchandise imports and exports 
(M$ and X$).
The variable A is the net stock of foreign security and reserve holdings. It is 
constructed by summing past values of S from a base period value of zero. The 
summation begins in the first quarter for which data on S exist. This means that 
the A series is off by a constant amount each period (the difference between the 
true value of A in the base period and zero). In the estimation work the functional 
forms were chosen in such a way that this error was always absorbed in the esti­
mate of the constant term. It is important to note that A measures only the net as­
set position of the country vis-a-vis the rest of the world. Domestic wealth, such 
as the domestically owned housing stock and plant and equipment stock, is not in­
cluded.
V: Stock of Inventories
Data on inventory investment, denoted Fl in the ROW model, are available for each 
country, but not data on the stock of inventories, denoted V. By definition V — 
+
V1. Given this equation and data for V1, V can be constructed once a base period and 
base period value are chosen. The base period was chosen for each country to be the 

B.3 || Variable Construction
241
quarter or year prior to the beginning of the data on VI. The base period value was 
taken to be the value of Y in the base period for the quarterly countries and the value 
of .25T for the annual countries.
Excess Labor
Good capital stock data are not available for countries other than the United States. If 
the short-run production function for a country is one of fixed proportions and if capital 
is never the constraint, then the production function can be written:
Y = LAM(J ■ Ha), 
(B.l)
where Y is production, J is the number of workers employed, and HJa is the num­
ber of hours worked per worker. LAM is a coefficient that may change over time 
due to technical progress. The notation in equation B.l is changed slightly from 
that in equation A.l for the US model. J is used in place of JF because there 
is no disaggregation in the ROW model between the firm sector and other sec­
tors. Similarly, Ha is used in place of HFa. Note also that Y refers here to the 
total output of the country (real GDP), not just to the output of the firm sector. 
Data on Y and J are available. Contrary to the case for the United States, data on 
the number of hours paid for per worker (denoted HF in the US model) are not 
available.
Given the production function B.l, excess labor is measured as follows for each 
country. First, log(V/J) is plotted for the sample period. This is from equation B.l a 
plot of logCL4A7 • Ha). If it is assumed that at each peak of this plot Ha is equal to the 
same constant, say H, then one observes at the peaks log(MAf • H). Straight lines are 
drawn between the peaks (peak-to-peak interpolation), and log(MA7 • //) is assumed 
to lie on the lines. If, finally, H is assumed to be the maximum number of hours that 
each worker can work, then Y/ (LAM ■ H) is the minimum number of workers required 
to produce Y, which is denoted JMIN in the ROW model. LAM • H is simply denoted 
LAM, and the equation determining JMIN is equation 1-13 in Table B.3. The actual 
number of workers on hand, J, can be compared to JMIN to measure the amount of 
excess labor on hand.
Labor Market Tightness: The Z Variable
A labor market tightness variable, denoted Z, is constructed for each country as follows. 
First, a peak-to-peak interpolation of J J (= J/POP) is made, and JJP (the peak-to-peak 
interpolation series) is constructed. Z is then equal to the minimum of 0 and 1 — JJP/JJ, 
which is equation I-16 in Table B.3. Z is such that when labor markets are tight (JJ close 
to JJP) it is zero or close to zero, and as labor markets loosen (JJ falling relative to JJP) 
it increases in absolute value.

242
Appendix B || The ROW Model
YS: Potential Output
A measure of potential output, YS, is constructed for each country in the same manner 
as was done for the US model. The only difference is that here output refers to the 
total output of the country rather than just the output of the firm sector. The equation 
for YS is YS = LAM • JJP • POP, which is equation 1-17 in Table B.3. Given YS, a gap 
variable can be constructed as (YS — Y)/YS, which is denoted ZZ in the ROW model. 
ZZ is determined by equation 1-18 in Table B.3.
B.4 
The Identities
The identities for each country are listed in Table B.3. There are up to 20 identities per 
country. (The identities are numbered 1-1 through 1-22, with no identities I-10 and I­
11.) Equation 1-1 links the non-NIPA data on imports (that is, data on M and MS) to 
the NIPA data (that is, data on IM). The variable LMDS in the equation picks up the 
discrepancy between the two data sets. It is exogenous in the model. Equation 1-2 is a 
similar equation for exports. Equation 1-3 is the income identity; equation 1-4 defines 
inventory investment as the difference between production and sales; and equation 1-5 
defines the stock of inventories as the previous stock plus inventory investment.
Equation 1-6 defines S, the current account balance. Equation 1-7 defines A, the net 
stock of foreign security and reserve holdings, as equal to last period’s value plus S. 
(Remember that A is constructed by summing past values of S.)
Equation 1-8 links M, total merchandise imports in 95 1c, to M95$A, merchan­
dise imports from the countries in the trade share matrix in 95$. The variable A795$B 
is the difference between total merchandise imports (in 95$) and merchandise im­
ports (in 95$) from the countries in the trade share matrix. It is exogenous in the 
model.
Equation 1-9 links E, the average exchange rate for the period, to EE, the end of 
period exchange rate. If the exchange rate changes fairly smoothly within the period, 
then E is approximately equal to (EE + EE_ j)/2. A variable PSI 1 was defined to make 
the equation E — PSI1 [(EE + EE_1)/2\ exact, which is equation 1-9. One would expect 
PSI} to be approximately one and not to fluctuate much over time, which is generally 
the case in the data.
Equation 1-12 defines the civilian unemployment rate, UR. LI is the labor force of 
men, and L2 is the labor force of women. J is total employment, including the armed 
forces, and AF is the number of people in the armed forces. UR is equal to the number 
of people unemployed divided by the civilian labor force.
Equations I-13 through I-18 pertain to the measurement of excess labor, the labor 
constraint variable, and potential output. These have all been discussed above.
Equation 1-19 links PM, the import price deflator obtained from the IFS data, to 
PMP, the import price deflator computed from the trade share calculations. The variable 
that links the two, PSI2, is taken to be exogenous.
Equation 1-20 links the exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar, E, to the exchange 
rate relative to the German Deutsche mark, H. This equation is used to determine 

B.6 || Solution of the MC Model
243
H when equation 9 determines E, and it is used to determine E when equation 9 
determines H.
Equation 1-21 determines NW, an estimate of the net worth of the country. Net worth 
is equal to last period’s net worth plus investment plus net exports.
Finally, equation 1-22 defines the country’s export price index in terms of U.S. 
dollars.
B.5 
The Linking Equations
The equations that pertain to the trade and price links among countries are presented 
next in Table B.3. All imports and exports in this part of the table are merchandise 
imports and exports only. The equations L-l determine the trade share coefficients, 
ay. The estimation of the trade share equations is discussed in section 2.4. ay is the 
share of z’s merchandise exports to j out of total merchandise imports of j. Given ay 
and M95$Ay, the total merchandise imports of j, the equations L-2 determine the level 
of exports from i to j, XX95$y. The equations L-3 then determine the total exports of 
country i by summing XX95$y over j.
The equations L-4 link export prices to import prices. The price of imports of country 
i, PMPi, is a weighted average of the export prices of other countries (except for country 
59, the “all other” category, where no data on export prices were collected). The weight 
for country j in calculating the price index for country i is the share of country j’s exports 
imported by i.
The equations L-5 define a world price index for each country, which is a weighted 
average of the 58 countries’ export prices except the prices of the oil-exporting coun­
tries. The world price index differs slightly by country because the own country’s price 
is not included in the calculations. The weight for each country is its share of total 
exports of the relevant countries.
B.6 
Solution of the MC Model
The way in which the US and ROW models are linked is explained in Table B.5. The 
two key variables that are exogenous in the US model but become endogenous in the 
overall MC model are exports, EX, and the price of imports, PIM. EX depends on 
X95$(75, which is determined in Table B.3. PIM depends on PMfjS, which depends on 
PMPUS, which is also determined in Table B.3.
Feeding into Table B.3 from the US model are PXUS and A/95$Ara. PXUS is deter­
mined in the same way that PX is determined for the other countries, namely by equation 
11. In the US case log PXUS — log PW$US is regressed on log GDPD — log PW$US. 
The equation is:
log PXUS - log PW$US = A (log GDPD - log PW$US).
This equation is estimated under the assumption of a second-order autoregressive 
error for the 1962:1-2001:4 period. The estimate of A is .925 with a t-statistic of 

244
Appendix B || The ROW Model
25.86. The estimates (/^-statistics) of the two autoregressive coefficients are 1.48 (21.00) 
and —.49 (—6.87), respectively. The standard error is .0114. Given the predicted 
value of PXUS from this equation, PEX is determined by the identity listed in Table 
B.5: PEX — DEL3 • PXUS. This identity replaces identity 32 in Table A.3 in the US 
model.
M95$A us, which, as just noted, feeds into Table B.3, depends on MuS, which 
depends on IM. This is shown in Table B.5. IM is determined by equation 27 in the 
US model. Equation 27 is thus the key equation that determines the U.S. import value 
that feeds into Table B.3.
Because some of the countries are annual, the overall MC model is solved a year 
at a time. A solution period must begin in the first quarter of the year. In the following 
discussion, assume that year 1 is the first year to be solved. The overall MC model is 
solved as follows:
1. Given values of X95$, PMP, and PW$ for all four quarters of year 1 for each 
quarterly country and for year 1 for each annual country, all the stochastic equations 
and identities are solved. For the annual countries “solved” means that the equations 
are passed through k± times for year 1, where ky is determined by experimentation 
(as discussed below). For the quarterly countries “solved” means that quarter 1 of 
year 1 is passed through k} times, then quarter 2 k{ times, then quarter 3 k\ times, 
and then quarter 4 k{ times. The solution for the quarterly countries for the four 
quarters of year 1 is a dynamic simulation in the sense that the predicted values 
of the endogenous variables from previous quarters are used, when relevant, in the 
solution for the current quarter.
2. Given from the solution in step 1 values of E, PX, and M95$A for each country, 
the calculations in Table B.3 can be performed. Since all the calculations in Table 
B.3 are quarterly, the annual values of E, PX, and A795$A from the annual countries 
have to be converted to quarterly values first. This is done in the manner discussed at 
the bottom of Table B.3. The procedure in effect takes the distribution of the annual 
values into the quarterly values to be exogenous. The second task is to compute 
PX$ using equation L-l. Given the values of PX$, the third task is to compute the 
values of atj from the trade share equations—see equation 2.41 in Chapter 2. This 
solution is also dynamic in the sense that the predicted value of for the previous 
quarter feeds into the solution for the current quarter. (Remember that the lagged 
value of ofy is an explanatory variable in the trade share equations.) The fourth task 
is to compute X95$, PMP, and PVF$ for each country using equations L-2, L-3, and 
L-4. Finally, for the annual countries the quarterly values of these three variables 
are then converted to annual values by summing in the case of X95$ and averaging 
in the case of PMP and FW$.
3. Given the new values of X95$, PMP, and PVF$ from step 2, repeat step 1 and then 
step 2. Keep repeating steps 1 and 2 until they have been done k2 times. At the end 
of this, declare that the solution for year 1 has been obtained.

B.6 || Solution of the MC Model
245
4. Repeat steps 1, 2, and 3 for year 2. If the solution is meant to be dynamic, use the 
predicted values for year 1 for the annual countries and the predicted values for the 
four quarters of year 1 for the quarterly countries, when relevant, in the solution for 
year 2. Continue then to year 3, and so on.
I have found that going beyond = 10 and k2 = 10 leads to very little change in 
the final solution values, and these are the values of kx and k2 that have been used for 
the results in this book.

Linking of the Annual and Quarterly Data
• Quarterly data exist for all the trade share calculations, and all these calculations are quarterly. 
Feeding into these calculations from the annual models are predicted annual values of PX$(, 
M95$A/, and Ej. For each of these three variables the predicted value for a given quarter was 
taken to be the predicted annual value multiplied by the ratio of the actual quarterly value to 
the actual annual value. This means in effect that the distribution of an annual value into its 
quarterly values is taken to be exogenous.
• Once the quarterly values have been computed from the trade share calculations, the annual 
values of X95$; that are needed for the annual models are taken to be the sums of the quarterly 
values. Similarly, the annual values of PMPt and PVF$Z- are taken to be the averages of the 
quarterly values.

Table B. 5
Links between the US and ROW Models
The data on the variables for the United States that are needed when the US model is imbedded 
in the MC model were collected as described in Table B.2. These variables are (with the US 
subscript dropped): EXDS, IMDS, M, MS, M95$A, M95$B, PM, PMP, PSI2, PW$, PX 
(— PX$), S, TT, XS, and X95$. The PXUS variable here is not the same as the PX variable for 
the United States in Appendix A. The variable here is denoted USPX in the MC model. The 
PX variable for the United States is the price deflator of total sales of the firm sector.

Determined in Table B.3.
Determined in Table B.3.
Determined in Table B.3.
Determined by an equation that is equivalent to equation 11 for the other countries. See the 
discussion in section B.6.
PEX =
DEI 3 ■ PXys- In the US model by itself, PEX is determined as PSI\ ■ PX, which is equation 
32 in Table A.2. This equation is dropped when the US model is linked to the ROW model. 
DEL3 is constructed from the data as PEX/PXUS and is taken to be exogenous.
PM us =
PIM =
PSI2us ■ PMPUS. This is the same as equation 1-19 for the other countries.
DELA ■ PMus- PIM is an exogenous variable in the US model by itself. DELA is constructed 
from the data as PIM/PMus and is taken to be exogenous.
EX =
(X95${75 + XSus + EXDSus)/^9QQ. This is the same as equation 1-2 for the other countries. EX 
is an exogenous variable in the US model by itself. EXDSVs is constructed from the data as 
1000EX — X95$ra — XSus andis taken to be exogenous.
Mus =
1000/A-/ — MSus ~ IMDSus- This is the same as equation I-1 for the other countries. IMDSVs is 
constructed from the data as 1000/A7 — MVs — MSus and is taken to be exogenous.
M95$Aro =
Sus =
— M95$Bus- This is the same as equation 1-8 for the other countries.
PXus(X95$us + XSus) ~ PMus(Mus + MSus) + TTus- This is the same as equation 1-6 for 
the other countries.
Note:
• The new exogenous variables for the US model when it is linked to the ROW model are DEL3, 
DEIA, EXDSus, IMDSus, M95$BUS, MSus, PSI2us, TTus, and XSus. EX and PIM are exogenous 
in the US model by itself, but endogenous when the US model is linked to the ROW model.

Construction of the Balance-of-Payments Data: Data for S and TT
The relevant raw data variables are:
M$' 
Goods imports (fob) in $, BOP data. [IFS78ABD]
MS 
Goods imports (fob) in $. [IFS71V/E]
X$' 
Goods exports (fob) in $, BOP data. [IFS78AAD]
XS 
Goods exports (fob) in $. [IFS70/E]
MS'S 
Services and income (debit) in $, BOP data. [IFS78AED + IFS78AHD]
XS'S 
Services and income (credit) in $, BOP data. [IFS78ADD + IFS78AGD]
X/'S 
Current transfers, n.i.e., (credit) in $, BOP data. [IFS78AJD]
A-/7S 
Current transfers, n.i.e., (debit) in $, BOP data. [IFS78AKD]
When quarterly data on all the above variables were available, then 5$ and 77$ were con­
structed as:
5$ = 
X$z + X.S’$ - MS' - MSS + XTS - MTS
77$ = S$ - X$ - XS$ + M$ + MS$
where S$ is total net goods, services, and transfers in $ (balance of payments on current 
account) and 77$ is total net transfers in $.
When only annual data on M$' were available and quarterly data were needed, interpolated 
quarterly data were constructed using M$. Similarly for MS$.
When only annual data on X$' were available and quarterly data were needed, interpolated 
quarterly data were constructed using X$. Similarly for X5$, XT$, and MT$.
When no data on M$r were available, then M$f was taken to be where X is the last 
observed value of 
Similarly for MS$ (where X is the last observed annual value of
MS$/M$).
When no data on X$z were available, then X$z was taken to be XX$, where X is the last observed 
value of A7$z/X$. Similarly for XS$ (where X is the last observed annual value of X5$/X$), 
for XT$ (where X is the last observed annual value of XT$/X$), and for MT$ (where X is the 
last observed annual value of MT$/X$).
The above equations for S$ and 77$ were then used to construct quarterly data for 5$ and 
TT$.
After data on S$ and 77$ were constructed, data on S and 77 were constructed as:
S= 
E ■ S$
TT = 
E • 77$
Note from MS and XS in Table B.2 and from MS$ and XS$ above that
MSS = 
(PM-MS)/E
X.S’S = 
(PX-XS)/E
Note also from Table B.2 that
M$ = 
(PM-M)/E
X$ = 
(795 PX -X95$)/E
Therefore, from the above equations, the equation for S can be written
S = 
PX(E95 ■ X95$ + XS) - PM(M + MS) + 77,
which is equation 1-6 in Table B.3.
