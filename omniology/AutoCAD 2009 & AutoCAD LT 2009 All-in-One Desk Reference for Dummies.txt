About the Author
Lee Ambrosius works for Autodesk as a technical writer for the Platform
Solutions and Emerging Business (PSEB) division and is based out of his
home office. Before that, he worked as an independent consultant for more
than three years, and before that he was a resident of a cubicle farm for about
eight years, where he worked as a systems analyst creating custom applications.
Even though Lee doesn’t work for himself anymore, he still runs his Web site,
www.hyperpics.com, and his blog, hyperpics.blogs.com. He has been
using AutoCAD since 1994, when he was first exposed to Release 12 for DOS,
and has been customizing and programming AutoCAD since 1996. Lee was an
AutoCAD consultant and trainer for more than ten years, and has been teach-
ing at Autodesk University since 2004.
For over a decade, Lee has authored a variety of works that include articles
for CAD magazines and white papers for Autodesk and has been a contribut-
ing author on a few occasions for AutoCAD books. He has been a technical
editor for the recent editions of AutoCAD For Dummies and AutoCAD and
AutoCAD LT Bible. The first version of this book, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT
All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, was his first venture into being a co-
author for a book before going off and authoring the book AutoCAD 2008 3D
Modeling Workbook For Dummies.


Dedication
To my grandmother, Theresa Severa (Grams, GG and all the other names
you go by), for always being there. I also can’t forget the influence you
have on my family and of course all the perks of having such a loving
person in our family.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I have to give a special thanks to the great folks at Wiley for being supportive
through this entire project. There is always that one shining star on a project
that keeps things moving like a well-oiled machine, and that individual was
my project and copy editor for this edition, Susan Pink. A special thanks also
goes out to my technical editor, Mark Douglas, for agreeing to work with me
on this edition of the book.
Thanks to all the folks at Autodesk, who are all dedicated to the work they
do. An extra thanks to Shaan Hurley and Bud Schroeder. Before joining
Autodesk, they were always willing to take time out of their busy days to
answer my questions during this project.

Introduction
F
or many reasons, AutoCAD is much different from most applications
that you will ever use. The main reason goes back some 20 years to
when AutoCAD was introduced as a low-cost CAD solution on microcomput-
ers. (CAD stands for Computer-Aided Drafting or Computer-Aided Design,
depending on who you ask.) Most CAD applications back then ran on very
large and expensive mainframe computers, not something that you could
take on-site with you.
With the introduction of AutoCAD, CAD wasn’t as foreign of a topic as it
once was, but it still had an uphill climb against the wide use and adoption
of drafting boards. A drafting board, you might be asking yourself? Yes,
before computers and CAD, all designs were done with pencil and paper; if
you were really good, you used ink and paper. Today, paper still plays a role
in distributing designs, but most designs are now done in a CAD application
that allows you to do much more complex things that were not possible
with board drafting.
As times and drafting practices changed, AutoCAD has led in setting the
pace for change or has forced change. Some of these changes have helped
to usher in the era of improved design collaboration across the Internet and
better electronic file sharing with non-CAD users. Because all objects in a
drawing are electronic, AutoCAD allows you to quickly manipulate and
manage them without the need to break out the eraser shield and eraser as
you would on a board. You can also use design information downstream in
other processes, such as ordering parts and developing a quote to complete
a project. Autodesk continues to improve the way you can visualize designs
and concepts through improvements in collaboration, 3D modeling, and
other features.
AutoCAD 2009 gives you the tools you need to create accurate 2D and 3D
designs, but it isn’t easy to just pick up and become productive right away
like you might with a word processor program. This book helps guide you
through the different areas of AutoCAD 2009 and AutoCAD LT 2009 so you
get up to speed faster and become productive as soon as possible. The dif-
ferent areas of drafting that I discuss include 2D drafting, 3D modeling, anno-
tation, creating and using reusable content, printing and plotting,

About This Book
AutoCAD 2009 & AutoCAD LT 2009 All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies
gives you an understanding of all the main features that you need to know to
be productive with AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT. The All-in-One Desk References
For Dummies are different from other For Dummies books that you may have
read; as much information as possible is crammed between the covers (and
some has even overflowed to the Web), and the content takes you deep into
the depths of AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT. This book is laid out to focus on
individual topics and allows you the freedom of moving around between its
minibooks. If you’re not familiar (or only somewhat familiar) with AutoCAD
or AutoCAD LT, I recommend that you read through Books I and II before
moving on to the other minibooks. Also, make sure that you go Book I,
Chapter 1, which walks you through creating a basic drawing.
After you read this book, don’t let it wander too far from your desk — you’ll
find it helpful as a reference.
Foolish Assumptions
I expect that you know how to use the Windows operating system and
understand the basics of navigating folders and starting applications. To
take advantage of everything that AutoCAD offers and what is contained in
this book, I assume that you have at least an Internet connection — dialup at
least, but a high-speed cable or DSL connection would be best. As long as
you have AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT installed on the computer in front of you
and a connection to the Internet, you’re ready to get started.
Conventions Used in This Book
Text you type in the command line window or in a text box appears in a bold
typeface. Examples of AutoCAD prompts appear in a special typeface.
When you see something like “click File menu➪Save As,” the arrow (➪) indi-
cates that you click the File menu and then click the Save As command.
AutoCAD offers a number of user interface elements to access commands.
The following sections explain the different command access methods and
the notation that you encounter throughout this book. I discuss all of these
and other user interfaces in Chapter 2 of Book II.
Menu browser access
Access to and using the menu browser is designated as, for example, “On the
menu browser, click Draw menu➪Circle➪Center, Radius.” In plain old
English, the notation means to do the following to use the menu browser:

Conventions Used in This Book

1. Click the Menu Browser button, which is the large red A, in the upper-
left corner.
2. On the menu browser, hover the cursor over the Draw menu.
3. Click the Circle submenu.
Submenus are denoted by the arrow next to the item on the right.
4. Click Center, Radius.
Figure I-1 shows the menu browser with the Draw menu and Circle submenus
expanded, and the Center, Radius command highlighted.
Ribbon access
The ribbon is very different from other user interfaces in AutoCAD because it
has areas of commands that are normally hidden. These hidden areas are
called slideouts. Access to and using commands on the ribbon is designated
as, for example, “On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Draw panel➪Line.”
1. On the ribbon, click the Home tab.
2. On the Draw panel, click the Line button.
Figure I-2 shows accessing a command on a panel of the ribbon.

If a command is on a flyout, which is a single button that can contain multiple
commands, the access to a command on a flyout is designated as “On the
ribbon, click Home tab➪Draw panel➪Circle button’s flyout➪Center Radius.”
1. On the ribbon, click the Home tab.
2. Click the Draw panel and then click the black arrow adjacent to the
Circle’s button.
3. On the pop-up menu, click Center, Radius.
Figure I-3 shows accessing a command on a flyout — notice the indication of
a flyout by the black downward arrow — on a ribbon panel:
Access to a command on a slideout panel is designated as, for example, “On
the ribbon, click Home tab➪Draw panel’s title bar➪Donut button.”
1. On the ribbon, click the Home tab.
2. Click the Draw panel’s title bar, located along the bottom of the
ribbon panel.
3. On the expanded Draw panel, click the Donut button.

Figure I-4 shows accessing a command on a slideout panel of a ribbon.
Slideout panels are indicated by the black arrow in the lower-right corner of
the ribbon panel.
Toolbar access
Access to toolbars is similar to how you work with the menu browser, except
with fewer clicks. Access to and using commands from a toolbar is desig-
nated as “On the Draw toolbar, click the Polygon button.”
Toolbars also support the use of flyouts. A flyout is a nested toolbar that is
represented by a single button with a black arrow in its lower-right corner.
You access a button on a flyout by clicking and holding down the mouse
button, and then dragging the cursor to the button on the flyout you want to
use, and then releasing the mouse button. Flyout access on toolbars is desig-
nated as “On the Draw toolbar, click Insert flyout button➪DWF Underlay.”
Figure I-5 shows the Insert flyout on the Draw toolbar; the flyout on the tool-
bar is designated by the black arrow in the lower-right corner of the button
on the toolbar.
Menu bar (“classic menu”) access
Access to and using the menu bar (or “classic menus”) is designated as, for
example, “On the menu bar, click Draw menu➪Circle➪Center, Radius.”

How This Book Is Organized
The following sections describe the minibooks that make up this book.
Book I: AutoCAD Basics
Chapter 1 of Book I gets you heading down the path to success with using
AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT. From there you dive into AutoCAD’s interface and
the basics of working with drawing files. This book provides some back-
ground on AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, and lists which versions are compati-
ble with each other. How to start the application is explained and you are
sent on a tour of the interface. You also see how to interact with commands
by using dialog boxes and the command line, and how to get help when you
need it most from the application. You also get a brief rundown on creating
and modifying some of the basic 2D objects, and using a few of the viewing

commands. The last two chapters of the minibook show how to use some of
the general object properties and settings, as well as the different drafting
aids that help you create accurate 2D and 3D drawings.
Book II: 2D Drafting
Book II covers many of the commands that are used for creating and working
with 2D drawings. The first part of the minibook focuses on creating 2D
objects that range from lines, circles, and arcs to more complex objects, such
as ellipses. Then you see how to select and modify objects that have been cre-
ated in a drawing. Modifying objects is one of the main tasks that you perform
in AutoCAD, next to viewing and creating new objects in a drawing.
Book III: Annotating Drawings
Book III covers how to create annotation in a drawing that explains a feature
or shows the measurement of an object. Annotation in AutoCAD includes
text, tables, dimensions, leaders, and hatch. For example, you see how to
create single and multiline text objects and tables. The chapter also includes
formatting specific characteristics of text and tables, performing spell check-
ing, and doing a find-and-replace on text strings. Last but definitely not least
is a chapter that covers how to work with annotation scaling.
Book IV: LT Differences
Book IV focuses on AutoCAD LT and how it is different from AutoCAD, along
with using it in the same environment as AutoCAD and expanding AutoCAD
LT through customization and other means. This minibook also explains
what to watch out for when you use both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT in the
same office.
Book V: 3D Modeling
Book V covers how to create, edit, view, and visualize 3D objects. You get the
basics of working in 3D, and see how to specify coordinates and adjust the
coordinate system to make it easier for you to create and modify objects
above the x,y plane. This minibook also covers how to navigate and view a
3D model in AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT.
Book VI: Advanced Drafting
Book VI covers the advanced drafting features that go beyond 2D drafting,
which include working with blocks, external references, and raster images.
You also find out how to reuse content that you create in multiple drawings
with DesignCenter and tool palettes.

Book VII: Publishing Drawings
Book VII covers generating a hard copy (paper copy) or an electronic ver-
sion of a drawing that can be viewed without AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT. You
see how to use page setups to define how part of a drawing should be
printed, and how to create floating viewports and layouts to help output a
drawing. You also discover how you can use sheet sets to manage and organ-
ize sets of drawings. Sheet sets provide ways to open drawings, keep data in
sync through the use of fields and views, and output a number of drawings.
This minibook also shows how to create plot configurations and plot styles,
and how to plot and publish a drawing layout or layouts to create hard
copies or electronic versions of drawings.
Book VIII: Collaboration
Book VIII covers some advanced topics that include CAD standards and file
sharing, as well as how to use electronic files for project collaboration. You gain
an understanding of the concepts behind CAD standards, as well as how to use
the available CAD standards tools to help maintain and enforce CAD standards.
Book IX: Customizing AutoCAD
Book IX covers techniques that are used to customize AutoCAD and
AutoCAD LT, which allows you to reduce the number of repetitive tasks and
steps that you might have to do to complete a design.
Bonus Content
The bonus chapters cover additional topics that just can’t fit between the
covers of this book. Bonus Chapter 1 covers working with 3D surfaces.
Bonus Chapters 2 through 5 cover extending AutoCAD through some of the
different programming languages that it supports. Programming AutoCAD 
is different from customizing it, but the goal of reducing repetitive tasks 
and steps that you have to do to complete a design are the same. Bonus
Chapter 6 covers working with object selection filters, AutoCAD’s calculator,
purging unused named objects, and auditing and recovering drawings. Bonus 
Chapter 7 describes creating your own shapes, linetypes, and hatch patterns.
Icons Used in This Book
This book uses the following icons to denote paragraphs that may be of spe-
cial interest:
This icon helps those who are using AutoCAD LT know what features are miss-
ing from AutoCAD LT that are in AutoCAD or in some cases where AutoCAD LT
is slightly different from AutoCAD. At times, you may not know the differences
between the two programs, and these paragraphs can help you determine
whether you should be using AutoCAD instead of AutoCAD LT.

This icon highlights what’s new in AutoCAD 2009 or AutoCAD LT 2009 or both.
This icon indicates a reference to additional content that is available in one
of the Bonus Chapters, which can be downloaded from www.wiley.com/go/
autocad2009aio.
This icon gives the gray matter an extra nudge here and there for things that
I talk about earlier in the book. AutoCAD is a large program, and it takes a bit
of time to put all the pieces together, so I give you some friendly reminders
along the way.
These paragraphs give insight into the inner workings of AutoCAD or some-
thing that you won’t typically need to know to use the program, but may find
interesting. As you read through the book the first time, you might want to
think of the Technical Stuff paragraphs as bonus material and not as
required reading, so feel free to skip them.
This icon indicates information that may save you some time or help you to
not fall too far from the path to success. For the most part, Tip paragraphs
are designed to help guide you through some of the overwhelming parts of
AutoCAD and give you what might not always be the most obvious way to
get to the desired result faster.
This icon helps you stay away from the deep end of AutoCAD and out of
trouble. Failure to adhere to the message may result in an undesired side
effect to your design.

elcome to AutoCAD 2009 & AutoCAD LT 2009 All-in-One Desk
Reference For Dummies, your one-stop shop for AutoCAD users of
every skill level. You’ve read this far, so I assume you know a thing or two
about the world’s most popular computer-aided drafting program —
enough, at least, to know that computer-aided drafting usually goes by the
much friendlier acronym of CAD.
AutoCAD 2009 & AutoCAD LT 2009 All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies is
aimed at AutoCAD users in every discipline — architecture, mechanical
design, mapping and GIS, product design, survey and civil engineering, dia-
gramming . . . whatever your field, you find useful information here. I cover
the entire CAD workflow process, not forgetting that 90 percent of the time,
what you need to produce at the far end of the workflow is a clear and well
laid-out paper drawing.
Reading about AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT is great, but without a good founda-
tion you’ll find it harder to understand other features. So roll up your
sleeves because it’s time to get your hands dirty — okay, get your mouse
moving and keys pressing.
This chapter helps you with the basics of using AutoCAD by explaining how
to set up a basic drawing, draw and edit objects, add text and dimensions,
which are useful to communicate the design to others, and then print your
first drawing, which will be suitable for hanging on your refrigerator. Figure
1-1 shows the cabinet that you’ll create in this chapter.
Minibooks I and II will fill in many of the gaps that might leave you craving
for more about the basics of AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT. This is not uncom-
mon, because after you start AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT you’ll see a lot of dif-
ferent things. Don’t worry — I cover most of what you see on the screen. As
you move through the lessons, I point you to the chapters in the book that
will help you continue to expand your knowledge in that area of drafting in
AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT.

Starting AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT
14
Starting AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT
Congratulations on braving into the world of CAD, but before partying like a
CADstar you need to start AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT. Chances are pretty good
that you’re running Microsoft’s Windows operating system, and how you
start AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT varies slightly based on the configuration of
your computer.
To start AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT, do one of the following:
✦Windows Desktop: Locate on your desktop the AutoCAD 2009 or
AutoCAD LT 2009 shortcut, and then double-click the icon.
✦Windows Start Menu: Click the Start button➪(All)
Programs➪Autodesk➪AutoCAD 2009 (or AutoCAD LT 2009)➪AutoCAD
2009 (or AutoCAD LT 2009).
AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT starts and, like most applications, sits there and
waits for you to do something. For more on starting AutoCAD, see Chapter 3
of this minibook.
The first thing you encounter is the New Features Workshop, which tells you
what has been changed in the latest release and back two other releases. So
you can find out what changed in AutoCAD 2007 and AutoCAD 2008 (or
AutoCAD LT 2007 and AutoCAD LT 2008). For now, select the Maybe Later
option on the left and click OK. The New Features Workshop dialog box will
appear the next time you start AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT. In addition to the
New Features Workshop, you can get an overview of some of the latest fea-
tures in Chapter 2 of this minibook.
Accessing the right tools for the right job
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT have been around for a number of years, so they
offer a large variety of different commands and different user interface ele-
ments. The drawing you’ll be working with in this chapter is 2D only, and
most of the commands that you will use can be found on the ribbon along
with a few other user interface elements in AutoCAD. The display of the

ribbon and other 2D-related drafting tools is controlled through the 2D
Drafting & Annotation workspace. To set the 2D Drafting & Annotation work-
space current, follow these steps:
1. On the status bar, click the Workspace Switching icon.
2. Choose 2D Drafting & Annotation.
The menu browser, Quick Access toolbar, and ribbon are displayed at
the top of AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT, along with the command line
window and application status bar at the bottom.
To find out more about the different features of the user interface, see
Chapter 3 of this minibook. You can also find out more about workspaces 
in Chapter 2 of Book IX.
Creating a new drawing
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT create a blank drawing upon startup, but it’s a
good idea to select the drawing template that you want to use at startup and
not rely on the one that AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT creates for you. To create a
new drawing, follow these steps:
1. Click the Menu Browser button.
The Menu Browser button is located in the upper-left corner of AutoCAD
or AutoCAD LT. The menu browser opens.
2. On the menu browser, click File menu➪New.
The Select Template dialog box is displayed (see Figure 1-2).
Figure 1-2:

3. Select the acad.dwt drawing template (or acadlt.dwt if you’re using
AutoCAD LT) and click Open.
A new drawing is created for you based on the drawing template selected.
What is created should be saved
When you create a new drawing it’s always a good idea to save it right away,
and then to save frequently as you create or modify objects in the drawing.
To save a drawing, follow these steps:
1. On the Quick Access toolbar, click Save.
The Save Drawing As dialog box is displayed.
2. Browse to the (My) Documents folder by clicking the (My) Documents
link along the left side of the dialog box.
The (My) Documents folder opens.
3. In the File Name text box, enter Cabinet and click Save.
For more on creating, opening, and saving drawing files, see Chapter 4 of this
minibook.
Drawing Setup
Let’s see now: You have started AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT, displayed the 2D
drafting tools by setting the 2D Drafting & Annotation workspace current,
and created a new drawing. Sounds like a fair amount of work, but there’s
plenty more to do, so grab that cup of coffee so you’re ready for the rest of
the chapter because this is where it starts getting good.
You have to do a few things before you start drawing objects; after all, these
are technical drawings that you’re creating, so they need to be accurate.
Setting up your drawing and applying proper CAD standards are important.
Getting snappy and griddy
In this section, you do some initial drawing setup that allows you to draw
accurately and organize the objects you’ll be drawing. The following steps
explain how to set up snap and grid so that you can draw in specific incre-
ments, similar to using a sheet of graph paper to plot coordinate values:
1. On the status bar, right-click the Snap Mode button.
2. On the menu that’s displayed, choose Settings.
The Drafting Settings dialog box (see Figure 1-3) appears.
3. Select the Snap On (F9) and Grid On (F7) options.

4. In the Snap Spacing area, select Equal X and Y Spacing if it’s not
selected.
5. In the Snap Spacing area, double-click the Snap X Spacing text box,
and then type 1 and press Tab.
Because you selected the Equal X and Y Spacing option, the value in the
Snap Y Spacing text box was updated to match the value entered in 
the Snap X Spacing text box.
6. In the Grid Spacing area, double-click the Grid X Spacing text box,
and then type 1 and press Tab.
The value in the Grid Y Spacing text box is updated to match the value
in the Grid X Spacing text box.
7. In the Snap Type area, select Grid Snap and then select Rectangular
Snap if they are not already selected.
8. Click OK.
The Drafting Settings dialog box closes and you return to the drawing
window.
To find out more about other drafting settings and precision tools, see
Chapter 7 of this minibook.
Establishing the limits
The next set of steps explains how to control the size of the grid that should
be displayed. By default, the grid is 12 x 9 units in size, but the cabinet that
you will be drawing is 36 units wide x 27 units high. So in the following steps
Figure 1-3:
Configuring
snap and
grid with the
Drafting
Settings
dialog box.

Drawing Setup
18
you set the drawing limits — which control the size of the grid — to a more
appropriate size for the drawing you’ll be creating:
1. On the menu browser, click Format menu➪Drawing Limits.
The LIMITS command starts and displays the following prompt:
Specify lower left corner or [ON/OFF] <0.0000,0.0000>:
2. At the prompt, press Enter to accept the default value, which is dis-
played between the <> (angle brackets).
The following prompt is displayed:
Specify upper right corner <12.0000,9.0000>:
3. At the prompt, type 48,36 and press Enter.
The drawing limits are now set to 48x36, which gives you plenty of room
to draw the cabinet.
4. Chances are you can’t see the entire grid. On the status bar, click
Zoom. Type A and press Enter.
The drawing is zoomed to the extent of the drawing limits, so now you
can see the entire grid.
Organizing objects with layers
Just one more series of steps and then you’ll be on your way to drawing and
modifying objects. You need to create some layers that will be used to organ-
ize the objects you’ll be drawing. The following steps explain how to create a
layer. After you go through these steps, you need to run through some of the
steps a few more times to create some additional layers for the drawing:
1. On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Layers panel➪Layer Properties.
Layer Properties Manager (see Figure 1-4) is displayed.
New layer

2. Click the New Layer button.
A new layer named Layer1 is added to the list.
3. With the name of the new layer highlighted, type Cabinet.
4. In the row for the Cabinet layer, click the color swatch in the Color
column.
The Select Color dialog box (see Figure 1-5) is displayed.
5. Click the Index Color tab, select color 5 (blue), and then click OK.
6. With the Cabinet layer still highlighted, click Set Current.
The Cabinet layer is now current and any objects that you draw will be
placed on this layer.
7. Repeat Steps 2 through 5 to create the following layers:
a. Dimensions and set its color to 4 (cyan)
b. Handles and set its color to 7 (white)
c. Hatch and set its color to 9
d. Text and set its color to 1 (red)
e. Top and set its color to 6 (magenta)
When you’re finished, five additional layers are added to the drawing.
To find out more about layers, see Chapter 6 of this minibook.

Drawing and Editing Objects
Now that a good foundation has been laid down with layers, setting up some
of the precision drafting aids, and limits, it’s time to find out how to draw
and modify objects. For more on creating and modifying drawing objects,
see Chapter 5 of this minibook, and Chapters 1 and 2 of Book II.
Walking the straight and curved
You use different drawing commands to create objects that will be used to
communicate the design to the client for signoff or the shop floor so that the
part can be manufactured. Drawing objects can be simple lines, circles, or
more complex objects such as ellipses and splines. In this section you draw
rectangles, lines, arcs, circles, and polylines to create the front elevation of
the cabinet.
Don’t be a square
Rectangles in AutoCAD are four-sided objects with opposite sides parallel
and the same length. In this set of steps, you draw a rectangle to represent
the base of the cabinet:
1. On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Draw panel➪Rectangle.
The RECTANGLE command starts and the following prompt is displayed:
Specify first corner point or [Chamfer/Elevation/
Fillet/Thickness/Width]:
2. At the prompt, move the crosshairs in the drawing to the coordinate
point 6,6 and click (see Figure 1-6).
As you move the crosshairs in the drawing window, notice that the
crosshairs jump in increments of 1 unit; this is because snap is enabled.
The following prompt is displayed:
Specify other corner point or
[Area/Dimensions/Rotation]:

3. At the command prompt, type @36,3 and press Enter.
A rectangle that is 36 units wide and 3 units high is created.
Multiply segments, one object
Polylines are objects that can contain multiple straight and curved segments.
In the following steps you draw the outer edges of the doors for the cabinet:
1. At the command prompt, type PL and press Enter.
The PLINE command starts and displays this prompt:
Specify start point:
2. At the prompt, type 6,9 and press Enter.
The following prompt is displayed:
Specify next point or [Arc/Halfwidth/Length/
Undo/Width]:
3. On the status bar, click the Ortho Mode button until you see <Ortho
on> displayed in the command line window.
Ortho mode is enabled and the PLINE command continues.
4. Drag the crosshairs up, and then type 23 and press Enter.
A vertical line segment of 23 units is drawn.
5. Drag the crosshairs to the right, and then type 36 and press Enter.
6. Drag the crosshairs down, and then type 23 and press Enter twice.
A polyline with three segments is created and the PLINE command ends.
The object in the drawing should now look like Figure 1-7.

Going straight from point A to point B
Lines are straight objects that are defined between two points. In the following
procedure you draw a line from the middle of the second segment of the poly-
line that you created in the preceding procedure to the middle of the top line of
the rectangle that you drew in the first procedure in this section. The line that
you draw will represent the gap between the left and right doors of the cabinet.
1. On the status bar, right-click the Snap Mode button and choose Off
from the shortcut menu.
The crosshairs can now freely move around the drawing window.
2. On the status bar, right-click the Grid Display button and choose
Enabled from the shortcut menu.
The dots used to represent the grid in the drawing window disappear.
3. On the menu browser, click Draw menu➪Line.
The LINE command starts and the following prompt is displayed:

8. Right-click the drawing window and choose Snap Overrides➪Midpoint.
Move the cursor up and pick the midpoint of the polyline segment
directly above the previous point you picked.
The line is drawn between the two midpoints you just picked.
9. Press Enter to end the LINE command.
Just a circle thing
Not all objects that you can create in AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT have straight
edges; after all, the world hasn’t been since 1492. In the next set of steps you
draw a circle that represents one of the handles for the doors on the cabinet:
1. On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Layers panel➪down arrow on the
Layers drop-down list➪Handles.
The Handles layer is set current.
2. On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Draw panel➪Center, Radius.
The CIRCLE command starts and displays this prompt:
Specify center point for circle or [3P/2P/Ttr (tan tan
radius)]:
3. At the prompt, type 26,26 and press Enter.
The following prompt is displayed:
Specify radius of circle or [Diameter]:
4. At the prompt, type D and press Enter to use the Diameter option.
The following prompt is displayed:
Specify diameter of circle:
5. At the prompt, type 1.5 and press Enter.
A circle with a diameter of 1.5 is drawn. Figure 1-9 shows what your cabi-
net should currently look like.

Going around the arc
Arcs are portions of a circle, which you can create in many ways. You use
arcs to represent fillets, rounds, and even transitions between objects. In the
following steps you draw an arc that will represent the right edge of the top
of the cabinet:
1. On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Layers panel➪down arrow on the
Layers drop-down list➪Top.
2. Right-click the Quick Access toolbar (located along the top of
AutoCAD to the right of the Menu Browser button) and choose
Toolbars➪AutoCAD➪Draw.
The Draw toolbar is displayed along the left side of AutoCAD.
3. On the Draw toolbar, click the Arc button.
The ARC command starts and the following prompt is displayed:
Specify start point of arc or [Center]:
4. At the prompt, hold down the Shift key and right-click.
5. On the Object Snap menu, choose Endpoint.
6. Position the cursor near the upper-right corner of the polyline that
you drew.
An orangish square appears at the endpoint of the line segment and a
tooltip with the text Endpoint is displayed near the crosshairs (see
Figure 1-10).
7. With the marker for the Endpoint active, click to pick the endpoint of
the line segment.
The following prompt is displayed:
Specify second point of arc or [Center/End]:
8. At the prompt, right-click the drawing window and choose End from
the shortcut menu to use the End point option.
The following prompt is displayed:
Specify end point of arc:

9. At the prompt, drag the crosshairs up. Then type 1 and press Enter.
The following prompt is displayed:
Specify center point of arc or [Angle/Direction/Radius]:
10. At the prompt, type D and press Enter to use the Direction option.
The following prompt is displayed:
Specify tangent direction for the start point of the arc:
11. At the prompt, type 0 and press Enter.
The arc is drawn and the ARC command ends.
Modifying objects
Next to drawing objects, editing objects is one of the most common tasks in
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT. You might even find yourself modifying objects to
create new objects instead of creating new objects from scratch. In this sec-
tion you find out how to copy and mirror objects to complete the elevation
of the cabinet.
Duplicating objects
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT offer the ability to duplicate objects by using the
COPY command. (What were you expecting me to say, the ZEROX com-
mand?) In this set of steps, you copy the lone circle to create a second one
to represent the other handle on the left door of the cabinet:
1. On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Modify panel➪Copy.
The COPY command starts and the following prompt is displayed:
Select objects:
2. At the prompt, position the pickbox (that square that was once the
crosshairs) over the circle and click. Press Enter to end object selection.
The following prompt is displayed:
Specify base point or [Displacement/mOde] <Displacement>:
3. At the prompt, press Enter to use the displacement option.
The following prompt is displayed:
Specify displacement <0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000>:
4. At the prompt, type @-4,0 and press Enter.
A copy of the selected circle is created 4 units to the left, and the COPY
command ends.

Here’s looking at you
Creating symmetrical objects is not uncommon in mechanical or even archi-
tectural designs. You can create mirror images of selected drawings to create a
symmetrical design or to invert the direction in which objects are created. In
these steps you mirror the existing arc to create the opposite side of the top:
1. On the menu browser, click Modify menu➪Mirror.
The MIRROR command starts and the following prompt is displayed:
Select objects:
2. At the prompt, position the cursor over the arc you drew earlier and
click. Press Enter to end the object selection.
The following prompt is displayed:
Specify first point of mirror line:
3. At the prompt, hold down the Shift key and right-click.
4. On the Object Snap menu, choose Endpoint.
5. Position the cursor near the end of the line that runs down the center
of the cabinet and click when the Endpoint marker appears.
The following prompt is displayed:
Specify second point of mirror line:
6. Drag the crosshairs up and click.
The arc is mirrored across to the other side of the cabinet and this
prompt is displayed:
Erase source objects? [Yes/No] <N>:
7. Press Enter to keep the original arc that was drawn.
The MIRROR command ends.
8. Draw a line between the top endpoints of the two arcs to complete the
top of the cabinet.
The cabinet should look like Figure 1-11.

Annotating with Text and Dimensions
Annotation is used to explain features of your drawing to the shop floor so
they know how to manufacture a part, or to include which materials or parts
are purchased so the proper papers can be bought and put into inventory.
You can place annotation in the form of text, dimensions, and leaders in your
drawing. To find out more about annotation, see Book III.
Expressing yourself through text
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT allow you to create text objects for placing titles
in a drawing, populating revision blocks, or placing general notes about the
design in the drawing. This set of steps explains how to create a single-line
text object that will hold a basic title for the drawing of the cabinet:
1. On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Layers panel➪down arrow on the
Layers drop-down list➪Text.
2. On the ribbon, click Annotate tab➪Text panel➪Single Line Text.
The DTEXT command starts and the following prompt is displayed:
Specify start point of text or [Justify/Style]:
3. At the prompt, right-click and choose Justify from the shortcut menu
to specify a different justification for the text.
The following prompt is displayed:
Enter an option [Align/Fit/Center/Middle/Right/TL/TC/
TR/ML/MC/MR/BL/BC/BR]:
4. At the prompt, right-click and choose MC from the shortcut menu to
use the middle center justification.
The following prompt is displayed:
Specify middle point of text:
5. At the prompt, pick a point above the cabinet.
The following prompt is displayed:
Specify height <0.2000>:
6. At the prompt, type 2.5 and press Enter.
The following prompt is displayed:
Specify rotation angle of text <0>:
7. At the prompt, press Enter to accept the default rotation of 0.
The in-place text editor is displayed.

8. In the in-place text editor that appears in the drawing window at the
point you picked in Step 5, enter %%uCABINET 36x27 and press Enter
twice.
The text string CABINET 36x27 is underlined and added to the text object.
Entering the drafting dimension
Rectangles in AutoCAD are four-sided objects with opposite sides parallel
and the same length. In this set of steps you place two linear dimensions
along the bottom and side of the cabinet:
1. On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Layers panel➪down arrow on the
Layers drop-down list➪Dimension.
2. At the command prompt, type DIMSCALE and press Enter.
The DIMSCALE system variable controls the size that dimensions are
displayed in a drawing. The following prompt is displayed:
Enter new value for DIMSCALE <1.0000>:
3. At the prompt, type 12 and press Enter.
4. On the ribbon, click Annotate tab➪Dimensions panel➪Linear.
The DIMLINEAR command starts and the following prompt is displayed:
Specify first extension line origin or <select object>:
5. At the prompt, press Enter to use the select object option.
The following prompt is displayed:
Select object to dimension:
6. At the prompt, select the bottommost line, which is part of the 
rectangle.
The following prompt is displayed:
Specify dimension line location or [Mtext/Text/Angle/
Horizontal/Vertical/Rotated]:
7. At the prompt, drag the crosshairs down and pick a point below the
cabinet.
The linear dimension is created and the DIMLINEAR command ends.
8. Press Enter to repeat the DIMLINEAR command.
9. At the prompt, hold down the Shift key and right-click.
10. On the Object Snap menu, choose Endpoint.
11. Position the cursor near the lower-right corner of the rectangle and
click when the Endpoint marker appears.

After you’ve spent time creating and perfecting your design, it’s time to
share it with others. Typically, you’ll produce a hard copy (paper copy) of
the drawing or an electronic version that can be sent through e-mail and
viewed by non-AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT users. To plot your drawing on an
81⁄2-by-11-inch sheet of paper, follow these steps:
1. On the Quick Access toolbar, click Plot.
The Plot dialog box (see Figure 1-13) is displayed.
2. In the Printer/Plotter area, click the down arrow on the drop-down
list and select Default Windows System Printer.pc3.
3. In the Paper Size area, select Letter from the drop-down list.
4. In the Plot Area area, select Extents from the drop-down list.
5. In the Plot Offset area, select Center the Plot if it’s not already selected.
6. In the Plot Scale area, select Fit to Paper if it’s not already selected.

P
ersonal computers revolutionized the drafting trade in the 1980s.
Before that, some drafting was computerized, but the computers were
mainframes or minicomputers (equivalent to the Stanley Steamers and
Baker Electrics of the early days of motoring), well beyond the price range
of most small architectural or engineering firms.
As a result, even as recently as 30 years ago, virtually all drafting was done
by grizzled veterans wearing green eyeshades in smoke-filled back rooms.
And not on computers!
In the old days, apprentice drafters (who were called draftsmen — or even
draughtsmen — for it was a male profession) started their careers on the
boards as tracers. Hard to believe, but there was a time before mechanical
reproduction when every copy of an engineering drawing had to be traced,
by hand, from an original. If you’re being forced to master AutoCAD, you
may grumble, but you should be thankful you do not have to go through a
procedure like that!
Today, drafting is much easier because of AutoCAD. Maybe your boss is
making you use AutoCAD, or you have to pass a course. But there are other
reasons to use it — some of which may help you pass that course or get
home from the office a little earlier. Here are some advantages to using CAD:
✦Precision: AutoCAD is capable of precision to 14 significant digits (ask
your math prof or your counselor why one digit should be more signifi-
cant than another). That’s way more precise than the best manual
drafter could ever be.
✦Appearance: AutoCAD-produced drawings are cleaner, easier to read
when reduced, and more consistent than manually drafted drawings.

Understanding AutoCAD Files and Formats
32
✦Reuse: It’s easy to copy and paste parts of drawings into other drawings
for use on new projects.
✦Scalability: You draw things full size in AutoCAD on an infinitely large
drawing sheet. This not only eliminates the possibility of scaling errors
as you draw, it also lets you print your drawings at any scale.
✦Sharing work: Drawing files can be shared with consultants and con-
tractors, who can add their own information without having to redraft
the entire drawing.
✦Distributing work: No more running dozens of prints and having them
sent by courier to clients — using AutoCAD, you can electronically
transmit drawings through e-mail or upload them to a shared Web
space.
✦3D benefits: You’re not limited to 2D space; AutoCAD’s drawing space is
three dimensional, so you can create models of your projects and gener-
ate drawings from them.
Understanding AutoCAD Files and Formats
Like every other computer program under the sun, AutoCAD has its own digi-
tal file format. Unlike a Paint program, where the image is created by series of
dots, CAD programs store the locations of objects in a database format. Every
object in a drawing file — every line, arc, circle, dimension, and so on — 
is located in the 2D or 3D drawing space by using a Cartesian coordinate
system. For more on coordinate systems in AutoCAD, see Chapter 7 later in
this minibook.
AutoCAD is a backward-compatible program. This does not mean that you
can open drawings backward or upside down. It simply means that files cre-
ated in any release of AutoCAD can be opened in a same or newer release of
AutoCAD. For example, if you have AutoCAD 2009, you can open a file cre-
ated in any release of AutoCAD since the very first one. If you’re working
with an older release — say, AutoCAD 2002 — you can open files created in
that release and older, but you can’t open files created in AutoCAD 2004 or
newer.
Unless indicated otherwise (for example, with an AutoCAD LT icon), when I
mention AutoCAD 2009, I include AutoCAD LT 2009 as well. There are some
differences between the two programs, but there are more similarities. In the
next section, “Seeing the LT,” I take a closer look at those differences.
Table 2-1 lists AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT releases and their file formats.

Remember, newer releases can open older files, but older releases generally
can’t open newer files. However, all recent releases of AutoCAD give you the
option of saving a drawing to four file formats. For example, in AutoCAD 2009’s
File menu, you can use the Save As command to save a drawing file back to
the AutoCAD 2004 file format (which includes AutoCAD 2005 and AutoCAD
2006) or AutoCAD 2000 file format (which includes AutoCAD 2000i and
AutoCAD 2002) so that anyone with those releases can open your drawing.
If you’re using AutoCAD 2009, you can save drawing files so they can be
opened with AutoCAD Release 14 (and AutoCAD LT 97/LT 98), which first
came out over a decade ago, in early 1997. If you’re using AutoCAD 2006 or
earlier, you’re limited to two file formats back. On the off chance you need to
go back farther than that, go to www.autodesk.com/dwg and download a
copy of Autodesk DWG TrueView — a conversion program that does not
require AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT to be installed — and use it to save back to
AutoCAD R14 DWG format.
If you receive a DWG file that was saved with a newer release than the one
you’re currently using, you can use Autodesk DWG TrueView to save the
DWG file to a file format that you can open with your release of AutoCAD.
Seeing the LT
As most people quickly discover, AutoCAD is an expensive program. To
soften the blow, several years ago Autodesk introduced a release of AutoCAD
called AutoCAD LT that contained less functionality. An old rule called the
80-20 rule states that you get 80 percent of the functionality for 20 percent of

Using AutoCAD’s Latest-and-Greatest Feature Set
34
the price. Nowadays, the 20 percent is more like 40 percent of the price of
AutoCAD, but it’s still a good deal if you’re looking for a primarily 2D drafting
program.
Mostly, this means if you never do (or never plan to do) 3D work in AutoCAD,
you may — emphasis on may — be able to get away with AutoCAD LT and
save some cash. In other parts of this book, I tell you more about AutoCAD LT.
Watch for the icons in the margins and read the AutoCAD LT–specific notes to
see whether you’re in that category. From experience, I can safely say that if
you have never used AutoCAD before, you will never miss most of the fea-
tures that are not carried over from AutoCAD to AutoCAD LT. However, if
you’re a proficient AutoCAD user, and you find yourself in a new office that
has AutoCAD LT rather than AutoCAD, there may be dozens of features you
will sorely miss.
I tell you much more about the differences between AutoCAD and AutoCAD
LT in Book IV.
Using AutoCAD’s Latest-and-Greatest Feature Set
When I say using AutoCAD’s feature set, I mean really using the program’s fea-
tures. It’s all too common for offices to introduce new releases of AutoCAD
to the drawing office without giving proper training or even demonstrations
of new features to the people who have to use it. As a result, many drafters
continue using the latest release in exactly the same way they used AutoCAD
five or ten years ago. Through lack of interest (and because you’re reading
this book, I’m sure you do not fall into that category) or more likely lack of
time, many AutoCAD users simply bypass features that can make them more
efficient.
For example, it’s very common to read the AutoCAD forums and see ques-
tions from people asking how to turn off this or that feature — often features
such as the right-click shortcut menus that specifically relate to the com-
mand being run.
In this book I focus on some of the major new and enhanced features of recent
releases, such as creating 3D solids (new in AutoCAD 2007), Multileaders 
(new in AutoCAD 2008), and Action Recorder (which is making its first appear-
ance in AutoCAD 2009). I also make a strong pitch on using many of the other
enhancements that have been introduced in recent releases.
AutoCAD 2009 is the release for those who have wanted to get into customiz-
ing AutoCAD but have been turned off by needing to know a programming
language. These users will see their dreams start to come true in the form of
Action Recorder. Along with Action Recorder, there are many enhancements
for 2D and 3D users. Here’s a brief rundown of what’s new:

Book I
Chapter 2
Drawing on and 
in AutoCAD
Using AutoCAD’s Latest-and-Greatest Feature Set
35
✦Navigating a 3D model is now easier than before with the introduction of
the ViewCube and SteeringWheels.
✦The user interface has received a face-lift in the form of a new enhanced
status bar, the addition of a menu browser, and a ribbon that is similar
to the one found in Microsoft Office 2007.
✦Properties for objects in a drawing can be accessed and queried by
using the new Quick Properties panel and rollover tooltips.
✦Actions can be recorded with Action Recorder to reduce the number of
repetitive tasks that would normally need to be performed manually.
✦Named views can be assigned movement and used to navigate a drawing
through ShowMotion.
✦Open drawings and layouts can be navigated visually with the help of
thumbnails displayed in Quick View.
✦Support to publish DWFx files has been added, which allows you to view
and print DWFx files by using Windows Vista or Windows XP with the
XPS Viewer.
✦Layers can be accessed by using a modeless user interface which allows
you to see layer changes automatically without the need to click Apply
first.
Alas, LT still does not do 3D, so some of the nifty new features are not part of
the package. However, LT has some new features (which have been available
in AutoCAD for several releases).
Some of the new enhancements in AutoCAD LT this release are
✦Fields are no longer limited to being only viewed; you can now create
fields by using the FIELD command. Because AutoCAD LT does not 
support sheet sets, fields specific to sheet sets are not available for
insertion.
✦True color support has been added, allowing you to assign a true color
to an object in the form of an RGB/HSL color or a Color Book color.
✦Raster images can now be attached to a drawing file through the
External References palette.
✦You can create nonrectangular viewports on a layout and clip a rectan-
gular viewport by using the VPCLIP command.
You can find more details on all these features throughout the rest of the book.

ow do I start thee? Let me count the ways . . .” (with apologies to
Elizabeth Barrett Browning).
So, let me count the ways. . . .
Starting the Application
As with all good Windows programs — and AutoCAD is a very good
Windows program — you can make your drawings appear on-screen in
numerous ways.
For a start, there’s the . . . er, Start button, the one that Mick and the Rolling
Stones sang about way back when Bill Gates launched Windows 95 on an
unsuspecting world. To get to AutoCAD 2009 (or AutoCAD LT 2009), you
click Start➪(All) Programs➪Autodesk➪AutoCAD 2009➪AutoCAD 2009. (You
can tell you’re at the end of the line because the last AutoCAD 2009 has a
unique program icon rather than a generic folder icon beside it.) Figure 3-1
shows the Windows Vista Start menu gradually revealing AutoCAD’s pro-
gram icon.
The Start button works, but one thing that working in Windows has taught us
is to be efficient, and click-click-click-click-clicking is not the most direct way
to go about opening the drawing editor. Wouldn’t you know it — Microsoft
and Autodesk between them have come up with several alternatives called —
what else — shortcuts.

Starting the Application
38
Creating Start menu shortcuts
If you’re using Windows Vista or the Windows XP–style Start menu (as
opposed to the Windows NT/2000–style Classic Start menu), you may have
a large AutoCAD 2009 button in the left column — the top-level menu in
Windows parlance — that lets you click once to start the program (see
Figure 3-2).
This section of the Start menu can be used for the shortcuts to the programs
that you commonly use. You can remove these icons by right-clicking them
and choosing Remove from This List.
To add an AutoCAD shortcut to the top-level Start menu, right-click an exist-
ing AutoCAD shortcut icon and choose Pin to Start Menu. If you’re using the
Windows 2000, Windows XP, or Windows Vista Classic Start menu, you can
still put a shortcut to AutoCAD on your Start menu by dragging the AutoCAD
shortcut icon to your Start button (see Figure 3-3).

Using desktop shortcuts
By default, AutoCAD creates a shortcut on your desktop when you install the
program. If you’d like more control over where AutoCAD opens — that is,
where it’s going to save your files or where it will look for files to open —
you can modify the desktop shortcut so that it directs AutoCAD to a specific
Start In folder. The following steps explain how:

Figure 3-2:

Starting the Application
40
1. Right-click the AutoCAD icon on your desktop.
All recent releases of AutoCAD create a desktop icon by default. Unless
you’ve renamed it, yours will say “AutoCAD 2009” (or earlier).
2. Choose Properties from the shortcut menu.
A Properties window for the desktop icon appears, with the Shortcut tab
current and the text in the Target field highlighted.
3. Press Tab to highlight the text in the Start In field, and then type the
path to your chosen folder.
By default, the Start In folder is identified as UserDataCache, which actu-
ally points to a hidden folder under AutoCAD’s install folder but saves
new drawings to the My Documents folder, which can be confusing. It’s
best to create a new folder such as C:\DRAWINGS or to create a new
folder under your My Documents folder that is used to store just drawing
files. Note that the folder must exist before you can modify the shortcut.
4. Click OK to save the changes to the icon.
The icon is now configured to open in — and save to — the specified
folder, but there’s another thing you have to do from inside AutoCAD.
5. Double-click the icon to start AutoCAD.
AutoCAD starts, but it’s still wired to the My Documents folder. You need
to modify a system variable to rewire the program.
6. Type REMEMBERFOLDERS and press Enter, and then type 0 and press
Enter to change the setting of 1 to 0.
When REMEMBERFOLDERS is set to 1 (the default), AutoCAD ignores the
Start In folder specified in the desktop shortcut.
You can copy your desktop icon multiple times and set a different Start In
folder for each one. Using a Start In folder is helpful when you are working on
a few different projects and would like to avoid switching back and forth
between the folders in which the projects are stored while opening and
saving files.
Accessing files from Windows Explorer
If you need to work on drawings from multiple projects that may be in differ-
ent folders all over your hard drive, sometimes it’s easier to find the files 
in Windows Explorer than in AutoCAD’s Open Drawing dialog box. (Okay, I
find Windows Explorer handier than the My Computer window because you
can more easily move from folder to folder.) Double-clicking a drawing file
will open that file in AutoCAD.

As far as Windows programs go, AutoCAD 2009 is average in complexity. In
fact, compared with its first Windows release (Release 12 for Windows), it’s a
marvel of simplicity. If you have a nodding familiarity with other Windows
programs, you will not have any difficulty navigating AutoCAD’s interface.
Title bars
AutoCAD (and most other programs as well) has three levels of title bars.
The program itself has a title bar, each drawing window has a title bar, and
individual ribbon panels, ribbon tabs, and palettes have their own title bars.
Figure 3-4 gives you a sampling.
All three levels of title bars have more or less the same function:
✦The program title bar tells you the name of the program, which you know
already.
✦The drawing title bar tells you the name of the drawing file you’re work-
ing on and, optionally, its full path on your computer.

✦The ribbon panel or tab, or the palette title bar tells you the name of a
collection of tools.
The ribbon bar is a new interface element that organizes tools into panels
and tabs. The ribbon bar in AutoCAD is similar to the one found in the appli-
cations that are part of Microsoft Office 2007.
Similarly, you can control the placement and state of most elements — the
application and document windows, toolbars, and palettes — using the 
following actions:
✦Double-click the program title bar to toggle between a maximized or win-
dowed application window.
✦Double-click the drawing title bar to switch a windowed drawing file to
maximized within the application window. (This, of course, is a one-way
trip, because after the file is maximized, it no longer has a title bar.)
✦Double-click the handle on a toolbar or a palette’s title to toggle between
docked or floating locations. (To float a docked toolbar, double-click the
handles at the left side or top.)
✦Place the mouse pointer over an edge or corner of any unmaximized
window or toolbar, or any undocked palette, to resize it.
✦Click the X button at the top right (sometimes top left) to close a palette,
toolbar, drawing window, or AutoCAD itself. If you’ve made any changes
to a file, you’ll be prompted to save your work first.
AutoCAD menus and menu browser
AutoCAD 2009 uses two menu interfaces: the menu browser and the stan-
dard menu bar (see Figure 3-5). The standard menu bar that was displayed in
previous releases is not displayed by default.
To open the menu browser, click the Menu Browser button in the upper-left
corner of AutoCAD’s application window. After the menu expands in the
menu browser, run your mouse pointer down the menu to select a command
or expand one of the submenus (for example, File, Edit, or View). The first
five or six menus are common to most Windows programs.
The menu browser is a new interface element that allows you to recover a
little more of that precious commodity that you can never have enough of
when working with AutoCAD, screen real estate. The menu browser in
AutoCAD is similar to the one found in the applications that are part of
Microsoft Office 2007.

The second menu interface, the standard menu bar, was displayed in previ-
ous releases of AutoCAD but is not displayed by default in AutoCAD 2009. To
display the menu bar, right-click the Quick Access toolbar next to the Menu
Browser button and select Show Menu Bar. The menu bar is also displayed
by default if you make the AutoCAD Classic or AutoCAD LT Classic work-
space current by clicking the Workspace Switching icon on the status bar
and choosing AutoCAD Classic (or AutoCAD LT Classic) from the menu that’s
displayed. I cover the Workspace Switching button on the status bar later in
this chapter. For more information on workspaces, see Chapter 2 of Book IX.
Menus contain most of the commands you’ll need in AutoCAD, but not all
commands are accessible this way. You may have to click a button on a tool-
bar or the ribbon, or even (oh, gasp, the horror!) type a command.
AutoCAD’s menus are arranged as follows:
✦File: Create new or open existing files; print or publish drawings; add
plotters or plot styles; access utility commands; close the program
✦Edit: Undo and redo; cut, copy, and paste; select objects; erase objects;
find text in the drawing
Oddly enough, AutoCAD’s editing commands are not located on the Edit
menu — you’ll find them on the Modify menu. Watch out especially for
Copy because there’s one on each menu and they do different things!

✦Dimension: Add dimensions; format dimension styles
✦Modify: Edit . . . er, modify existing drawing objects; check or match
object properties
✦Express: Additional tools and commands to create and modify all types
of drawing objects (not in AutoCAD LT)
The Express menu is added as an option during the installation of the
program. I strongly recommend that you install the Express Tools when
you install AutoCAD. By default Express Tools is selected to be installed,
but if you do not want to install it you can disable the feature during the
install. Express Tools is available in only AutoCAD — not AutoCAD LT. I
tell you more about the Express Tools in Book IX.

AutoCAD toolbars
AutoCAD 2009 has 38 toolbars (not including the Express Tools toolbars),
most of which are closed by default. When you start AutoCAD for the first time
and choose AutoCAD Classic as your workspace, you see the Standard, Styles,
Workspaces, Layers, and Properties toolbars docked at the top of the screen,
between the menu bar and the drawing area. Docked at the left is the Draw
toolbar, and at the right, the Modify and Draw Order toolbars. Assuming you
installed the Express Tools, you might also see the three Express Tools tool-
bars floating near the top of the drawing area (see Figure 3-6).

Stop and take a deep breath, you’re not seeing things; some icons have been
altered in this release. However, you will get through the transition to draft
another day.
Unlike the menu system, toolbars contain a subset of AutoCAD’s commands.
Toolbars can be customized easily — I show you how in Book IX — and are a
highly efficient way of working with the program.
You already know how to close toolbars. (Hint: It starts with an X.) The easi-
est way to open toolbars is to put your mouse pointer over any tool button
and right-click. (Don’t left-click or you’ll run the command.) AutoCAD dis-
plays a list of toolbars; just select the one you want to open.
When you right-click a toolbar button, you see a listing of the toolbars that
share the same menu as the toolbar you right-clicked; to see the toolbars in
all loaded menus, right-click a button on the Quick Access toolbar and
choose Toolbars (or on the menu browser or menu bar, click Tools menu➪
Toolbars). From the Toolbars submenu, click the name of a loaded menu and
then the toolbar you want to display.

To save constantly opening and closing toolbars, or having so many toolbars
open that you can’t see the drawing window, you can open a bunch and then
save them as a workspace. I tell you how in Book IX.
Quick Access toolbar
The Quick Access toolbar (see Figure 3-7) is similar to one of AutoCAD’s stan-
dard toolbars, except it can’t be undocked. This toolbar allows you to quickly
access a set of commands no matter what other user interface elements (tool-
bars, menus, palettes, or ribbon panels) are displayed. By default, the Quick
Access toolbar contains the following commands, from left to right:
✦New: Create a new drawing based on a template or from scratch.
✦Open: Open a previously saved drawing file.
✦Save: Save the current drawing. If the drawing was not previously saved,
the Save Drawing As dialog box is displayed so you can enter a name
and specify a location for the drawing file.
✦Plot: Plot a drawing to a named plotter or an electronic file.
✦Undo: Undo the most recent command or action.
✦Redo: Undo the most recent undo operation.
The Quick Access toolbar is new to AutoCAD 2009 and is similar to the one
found in the applications that are part of Microsoft Office 2007.
You can customize the commands that are displayed on the Quick Access
toolbar. I tell you how in Book IX.
Palettes
AutoCAD 2004 introduced palettes, and they have become increasingly
sophisticated with each release. Some dialog boxes from earlier releases,
such as Object Properties & Layers, have been converted to palettes.
Palettes have the advantage of staying open on-screen while you do other
things (see Figure 3-8).

You open and close palettes by clicking their tool buttons on the ribbon bar
or a toolbar, from the menu system, or with a Ctrl+key combination indi-
cated in the following list. AutoCAD has the following palettes:
✦Ribbon: An interface that allows you to access commands that are
grouped by task, using panels and tabs. A panel organizes individual
commands, and tabs organize individual panels. The ribbon is a new
interface that expands on the Dashboard palette, which was introduced
in AutoCAD 2007. The ribbon can be docked horizontally along the top
of the program or vertically along the left or right side.
✦Properties: Lists all properties of selected objects, including layer, color,
coordinates, and style (Ctrl+1). For more on object properties, see
Chapter 5 of this minibook.
✦Layer: Use to create and manage the layers in a drawing. You can make
changes to the layers of a drawing in real time without having to apply
the changes first. For more on layers, see Chapter 4 of this minibook.

✦QuickCalc: Just like the one in your desk drawer, only it works with stuff
you’ve drawn as well as with numbers (Ctrl+8). I cover AutoCAD’s nifty
built-in calculator in Book VI.
✦External References: Manages the external reference files that are
attached to a drawing (drawing (xref), raster image, DWF, or DGN files). I
give you the scoop on working with external reference drawings, raster
images, and DWF and DGN underlays in Book VI.
✦Sheet Set Manager: Set up drawing sets by project for printing and elec-
tronic distribution (Ctrl+4). I tell you all about sheet sets and Sheet Set
Manager in Book VII.
✦Markup Set Manager: Review electronic markups of DWF files and incor-
porate necessary changes (Ctrl+7). Check out Book VIII for more on this
feature.
✦AutoCAD DesignCenter: Use to copy objects from one drawing to
another (Ctrl+2). I tell you more about DesignCenter in Book VI.
✦Lights: Lists all the lights in the current drawing that are used when ren-
dering. (Not in AutoCAD LT.) I take a look at creating lights in Book V.
✦Materials: Use to create and manage the materials in a drawing that are
used when creating a rendering. (Not in AutoCAD LT.) I cover creating
and using materials in Book V.
✦Visual Styles: Use to create and manage the visual styles in a drawing
that affect the appearance of the 3D objects in the current view. (Not in
AutoCAD LT.) I explain the purpose of visual styles in Book V.
✦Advanced Render Settings: Controls the settings used to create a ren-
dering of a 3D model. (Not in AutoCAD LT.) I look at rendering in Book V.
✦DBConnect Manager: Connect AutoCAD drawings with external data-
base files (Ctrl+6). This is an esoteric area of AutoCAD, and I do not
cover it in this book. (Not in AutoCAD LT.)
Anchoring and docking palettes allows you to keep the drawing window clear
of floating palettes. (Docked palettes? Anchored palettes? Could there be
some sailors at Autodesk?) An anchored palette is a combination of a docked
palette (which does not keep moving around on you) and a palette that is set
to auto-hide (which rolls up out of the way when you’re not using it). To
anchor any palette, right-click its title bar and choose Allow Docking. Then
right-click the title bar again and choose Anchor Left < or Anchor Right >. The
palette collapses and anchors its title bar along the left or right edge of the
application window.
Okay, at this point you’re probably dying to know what Ctrl+9 and Ctrl+0 
do, so go ahead and try them. And do not panic when parts of your screen

disappear — these keypresses are toggles, so just press Ctrl+9 again to bring
back the command window, and press Ctrl+0 again to restore all your tool-
bars, palettes, title bars, and other screen components. I tell you about the
command window shortly, in “The floating command window” section.
Pressing Ctrl+0 issues a command called CLEANSCREENON, which maxi-
mizes the program window, turns off the program title bar, all toolbars and
palettes, and hides the Windows taskbar. This maximizes your screen real
estate but leaves you with only the menu system and the keyboard to work
with. Press Ctrl+0 again to run the CLEANSCREENOFF command to restore
the previous state of the interface.
Drawing area
That big black (or maybe white) area that occupies almost 90 percent of
AutoCAD’s application window is the drawing window. Everything you draw
goes here. Each drawing consists of two different spaces and each can have
its own appearance. The two different spaces are model and paper. Model
space is where you create the objects that represent the object you’re draft-
ing, typically in full scale; whereas paper space is where you go to lay out
your drawing for plotting.
Keeping with the space theme, you can think of the model and paper spaces
as parallel universes. I tell you a lot more about these two spaces in Chapter
5 of this minibook. At this time, you just need to recognize this part of the
screen. The double-headed arrow in the lower-left corner of the drawing
window (see Figure 3-9) is called the UCS icon. When it looks like this, you’re
in model space. And that is where you should be when you’re drawing your
buildings, valves, or bridges.

Figure 3-9:

If your UCS icon looks like the one in Figure 3-10, you’re in the other space —
paper space. Paper space is also referred to as a layout, and a drawing can
contain many different layouts to control the plotting of a drawing. This is
where you put your drawing’s title block, add notes and dimensions, and
such. If your screen looks like Figure 3-10 rather than Figure 3-9, click the
Model button on the application window’s status bar or the Model tab at the
bottom left of the drawing area to switch to model space.
To display the Model and layout tabs, right-click the Model or Paper space
button on the status bar and choose Display Layout and Model Tabs. If you
want to remove the Model and layout tabs along the bottom of the drawing
window (to save some additional drawing real estate), right-click one of the
tabs and choose Hide Layout and Model Tabs. The Model and layout tabs
are hidden and a Model and Layout button is added to the application
window’s status bar.
Crosshairs
The on-screen mouse pointer takes on two different appearances when
you’re working in AutoCAD: one when working in 2D and a second appear-
ance when working in 3D. When you move the mouse outside the drawing
window, it looks like the standard arrow pointer you see everywhere else in
Windows. When you’re inside the drawing window, it turns into a pair of
lines that intersect at right angles, with a small square box (called the pick-
box) where they cross. You can change the length of the crosshairs in the
Options dialog box.
You also see the pickbox — without the crosshairs — when you’re selecting
objects. Many users find the default size (3 pixels square) too small, and I
concur. To change the size of the pickbox, type PICKBOX, press Enter, and
then set a new value. I find a 5-pixel-square pickbox a good compromise.

The floating command window
The command line — also known as the command prompt — is one of the
things that makes AutoCAD AutoCAD. It’s a throwback to earlier days, before
dialog boxes, toolbars, and pull-down menus were a glint in Bill Gates’s eye.
The command line lives inside the command window, that area of text near
the bottom of your screen.
AutoCAD is one of the few graphics programs where you still type — not just
numbers and distances, but command names and options. Unlikely as it may
seem (but obvious to grizzled AutoCAD old-timers), communicating with
AutoCAD through the keyboard is one of the most efficient ways to interact
with the program.
When you are new to AutoCAD, though, it’s not an obvious thing to remem-
ber. That is why most CAD classrooms have a sign in big red letters that says
Watch the command line! AutoCAD 2006 made a slight lurch into the 21st cen-
tury with something called dynamic input. When enabled, AutoCAD displays
interactive tooltips near the cursor; these show you a lot — but not all — of
the command line information. You may still need to look down at the
bottom of the screen to get the whole story. And if you’re using AutoCAD
2005 or an earlier release, WATCH THE COMMAND LINE!
In AutoCAD 2006 and later you can turn the command window off and on
with the Ctrl+9 toggle. I have even seen books that recommend that you turn
it off, but I think this is a bad idea. The dynamic input tooltips do not show
you everything that the command window does, so even if you are using
AutoCAD 2006 or later, and at the risk of repeating myself . . . watch the com-
mand line! Maybe if I ask nicely it will help reinforce getting into a good habit
of doing so, so Please watch the command line.
I tell you a bit more about the command window a few paragraphs from here.
So you can stop watching it until then.
The status bar
At the bottom of the application window is the status bar. The status bar
contains three elements. At the left side is the coordinates display, which
shows the x-, y-, and z-values of wherever your crosshairs happen to be at a
given moment. By default, the coordinates update as you move your mouse
around. Also by default, the coordinate values are displayed as decimal num-
bers with four places of precision. If you change to a different type of draw-
ing unit (I describe units in Chapter 4 of this minibook), the format of the
coordinates changes to match the drawing’s new unit type. To the right of
the coordinates readout is a set of buttons where you can easily toggle a
range of drafting modes such as snap, grid, and object snap. Table 3-1 lists
the different drafting status toggles found on the status bar.

tools they represent. To change the settings of a particular drafting tool,
right-click its status bar button and choose Settings from the menu that
appears. This displays a dialog box that you can use to change the behavior
of the drafting tool.
AutoCAD 2009 and AutoCAD LT 2009 by default display a graphic for each of
the drafting status toggles. You can right-click one of the drafting status
toggle buttons and choose Use Icons to switch between the graphical and
text buttons.
The Quick Properties panel allows you to access a defined set of properties for
selected objects. You use the Quick Properties panel the same way you use
the Properties palette, except you can customize the properties displayed 
for each object type. I talk more about using the Quick Properties panel in
Chapter 2 of Book II, and how to customize which properties are displayed 
in Chapter 3 of Book IX.

Communicating with Your Software
So now you know what everything is . . . but what do you do with it? You see
at the beginning of this chapter that there are a few ways to start AutoCAD.
Now you’re about to discover that you can do just about anything in multi-
ple ways in AutoCAD, beginning with how you speak AutoCADese.
The command line
Not to be confused with the LINE command, the command line is the place
where AutoCAD talks back to you (see Figure 3-11). Sometimes it just echoes
what you type (it’s easy to assume that it’s not very bright), but more often
it engages you in a helpful — if occasionally cryptic — dialog box.
Typically, you start your conversation with AutoCAD by issuing a command.
If you want to draw something new, AutoCAD usually starts by asking where
you would like it to start. You choose a point, and then AutoCAD asks how
big you want it. You tell AutoCAD, and the program draws the object.

Book I
Chapter 3
Navigating the
AutoCAD Interface
Communicating with Your Software

If you want to edit something that is already there, you issue a command —
for example, MOVE. AutoCAD asks you to select the objects to move. You
select them and press Enter to confirm your selection. The command now
starts prompting — for example, the MOVE command prompts for a base
point (a from point) and a second point (a to point).
You can switch off the display of the command window, but I think that is a
bad idea. There is just not enough feedback from dynamic input alone. The
best thing to do is to use both, the command line and dynamic input together.
Dynamic input
You might have the wrong impression about dynamic input by the way I
have talked about it, but truth be told it’s a great addition to AutoCAD. The
issue is that it changes the way you think about working with AutoCAD when
entering values or choosing coordinate points, so it will probably be easier
for the newbies than it is for the old-timers to adjust to the feature.
When dynamic input is enabled (by clicking the Dynamic Input button on the
status bar), AutoCAD displays tooltips near the crosshairs whenever a com-
mand is active or you move the crosshairs across the drawing window. When
AutoCAD is expecting you to choose a point, the tooltip displays a constantly
updating coordinate readout (x and y coordinates only). If AutoCAD needs
more information, such as the radius of a circle, you can type the desired
value into the tooltip.
Dynamic input is highly configurable. Right-click the Dynamic Input button
on the status bar and choose Settings to display the Dynamic Input tab of
the Drafting Settings dialog box. You can turn options on and off here and
further refine them by clicking the Settings buttons under Enable Pointer
Input and Enable Dimension Input.

Dialog boxes
AutoCAD has two types of dialog boxes — modal and modeless. Modal
dialog boxes are the regular, old dialogs you see in every Windows program.
They pop up whenever you save a new drawing, or want to format your
units, or make some drawing settings. Modal dialog boxes such as Save,
Open, and Plot take command of AutoCAD. You can’t do anything else while
one of these dialog boxes is open.
Modeless dialogs can stay open while you do other things in AutoCAD.
They’re so unique, in fact, that they’re not even called dialog boxes. They’re
called palettes, and you’ve already found out a thing or two about them.
AutoCAD has over a dozen modeless dialog boxes — or palettes — and I

Even when you execute commands by using menus from the menu browser,
menus from the menu bar, or toolbars, there are still significant differences
between AutoCAD and other Windows applications.
Grasping the AutoCAD difference
The fundamental difference with AutoCAD is that AutoCAD expects you to
take part in a conversation. When you tell the program you want to move
something, AutoCAD asks what you want to move, where you want to move
it from, and where you want to move it to.
Most of this conversation takes place in dialog boxes and the dynamic input
tooltips. One of the delights of AutoCAD is the number of different ways the
program has for doing what you ask it to do. All I can do at this point is refer
you to the chapters to come (starting with the early chapters of Book II).
Repeating a command
Oftentimes in AutoCAD, you want to perform the same action on different
objects. You might, for example, want to move a bunch of linework to a dif-
ferent layer, and then move a bunch of text to a third layer.
Pressing Enter or pressing the spacebar at a blank command prompt repeats
the last command. You can also right-click and choose the last command
from the top of the shortcut menu.
You can press the up-arrow key to retrieve the previous command. If you con-
tinue to press the up-arrow key, you can step back even farther in the list of
previously used commands in the drawing. To run the command, press Enter.

Running AutoCAD Commands
59
A nifty feature was added to AutoCAD 2004’s Options dialog box, and you
can use it in any 2004 or later release of AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT. On the
User Preferences tab, in the Windows Standard Behavior area, click the
Right-Click Customization button. In the dialog box, select the Turn on Time-
Sensitive Right-Click box. Click Apply & Close, and then click OK. Now, if you
right-click within a quarter-second (the default value in the dialog box), you
get a carriage return, just as if you had pressed the Enter key or spacebar. If
you keep the right mouse button pressed down for longer than a quarter-
second, you get whatever Windows shortcut menu is appropriate to the cur-
rent command.
Canceling a running command
To cancel a command, simply press Esc. If you’re a long-time user of
AutoCAD, and have been away for . . . well, a long time, you may be used to
pressing the Ctrl+C combination that issued a Cancel in all DOS releases of
AutoCAD. If you’re not one of those grizzled old-timers, you know that Ctrl+C
copies selected objects to the Windows Clipboard. Whatever your origins,
remember that Esc cancels whatever is happening in the drawing window.
Invoking transparent commands
Most AutoCAD commands are meant to be run without interruption. You
would not, for example, start drawing a line and then decide in the middle of
the line sequence that you wanted to draw a circle. Well, maybe you would,
but trust me, it’s not very efficient.
Other times, however, it’s efficient to run one command inside another. For
example, you might be placing a very long linear dimension, and you would
like to be able to zoom in closely on one end of the object to be dimen-
sioned, and then zoom in closely again on the other end.
You can do this with AutoCAD’s display commands, as well as with some of
the drafting settings, because these commands can be run transparently. A
transparent command is one that can be executed in the middle of another
command.
You may, for example, be in the middle of creating a linear dimension when
you realize you’re zoomed out too far and are unable to choose the defining
points accurately; so you go to the Standard toolbar or ribbon bar and
choose one of the Zoom commands. You execute the Zoom command, and
when you’re done, AutoCAD takes you back to the command you were run-
ning. The same thing happens with toolbars and ribbon panels — just click a
button, and your top-level command is suspended while the secondary com-
mand executes.

You can mimic this behavior at the command prompt by typing an apostrophe
before the command. The apostrophe is a sign to AutoCAD that what follows
is to be executed transparently. Many commands can be run transparently,
including most of the display commands. Go ahead and experiment: Just type
an apostrophe and then the name of a command, and see what happens.

I hope that the AutoCAD 2009 & AutoCAD LT 2009 All-in-One Desk Reference
For Dummies will answer most of your questions about using AutoCAD.
Nevertheless, there will be times when you want to go to the source of all
that is AutoCAD. Here are some ways of accessing AutoCAD’s Help system:
✦At a blank command prompt, enter ?
✦From the Help menu, choose Help
✦Press the F1 function key at any time
✦From the command prompt, type HELP
Using built-in Help
Most of the time, AutoCAD’s Help system is context sensitive. If you’re in the
LINE command and press F1 (or choose Help➪Help), the Help system will
launch and take you to information about the LINE command.
AutoCAD system variables
Not everyone uses AutoCAD the same way.
Despite its hundreds of commands, users want
those commands to operate in specific ways.
AutoCAD accommodates with an array of
system settings — called system variables —
that cover nearly all the bases. Many system
variables are toggles — they have a value of
either 0 or 1, meaning they’re either enabled or
disabled. For example, the system variable
MIRRTEXT controls what happens to text when
a group of drawing objects is mirrored. If MIR-
RTEXT is enabled (that is, set to 1), any text in
the group is also mirrored — it reads backward
on the screen. If MIRRTEXT is set to 0, the
objects, including the text object, are all mir-
rored, but the text itself is not mirrored, so it
reads the right-way around instead of appear-
ing backwards. However, the justification of the
text is altered, resulting in left-justified text
being right justified after being mirrored.
Other system variables can have different set-
tings (more than simply off and on), and still
others can store values that remain intact until
they’re replaced with new values.
For information on AutoCAD’s system variables,
go to the online help.

You can get context-sensitive help at the command line, too, by entering an
apostrophe and then a question mark (that is, ’?).
Tooltips
Tooltips are by far one of the most basic methods of getting help from a soft-
ware program. AutoCAD is no different; tooltips are used throughout the
user interface and provide information about a command button on a tool-
bar, an object in a drawing, or a control in a dialog box. To display a tooltip,
you simply point the cursor at the command button on a toolbar or almost
any other object and let the cursor hover over the object for a moment.
After a brief period, a small box appears with text that explains what the
object is or does in the case of a command button or control if it is clicked.
Figure 3-12 shows a few of the different tooltips found in AutoCAD.
Tooltips in AutoCAD 2009 have been greatly enhanced over what was avail-
able in previous releases. Tooltips now display information about the object
in the drawing window below the crosshairs, as well controls in dialog boxes.
In previous releases, to access the explanatory text for a control in a dialog
box, you had to click the ? in the upper-right corner of the dialog box and
then click the control; now you just let the cursor hover over the control.
Following is an overview of the different tooltips in AutoCAD:
✦Command and dialog box tooltips: Tooltips that display information
about a button or control on a toolbar or ribbon panel, a menu item on
the menu browser, and controls in a dialog box.
✦Extended tooltips: Extended tooltips go above and beyond just display-
ing plain textual messages. Extended tooltips are used to provide addi-
tional information about a command or control in a dialog box. When
the cursor continues hovering over a command or control after the
Figure 3-12:
Help is
available
right at the
tip of the
cursor.

Reaching for AutoCAD Help
62
tooltip is initially displayed, the tooltip expands to reveal additional
information about the object. If an object has an extended tooltip
assigned to it, the additional text and even images related to the object
are displayed.
✦Rollover tooltips: Tooltips that display the values for a specified set of
properties for an object when the crosshairs hover over an object in the
drawing window. To find out more about how to customize which prop-
erties are displayed on a rollover tooltip, see Book IX, Chapter 3.
✦Other tooltips: Some of the other tooltips display a thumbnail of a draw-
ing layout when the Model and Layout tabs are displayed, preview
images and details for a sheet in Sheet Set Manager, and the descriptions
of the fields in the Properties palette.
For more on controlling the display of many of the different tooltips that are
in AutoCAD, see Book IX, Chapter 2.
When a tooltip is displayed, and Press F1 for More Help is displayed in the
tooltip; do as it asks and press F1 to find out more about the user interface
element. The online Help system opens and displays a topic related to the
object associated with the tooltip.
InfoCenter
InfoCenter (see Figure 3-13) replaces what was called the Info Palette and
combines the functionality of the Communication Center in one place. The
InfoCenter is located in the upper-right corner of AutoCAD on the title bar
and allows you to search for information in the online Help system as well as
get information from your favorite blogs or Web sites that post content in an
RSS (Really Simple Syndication) file format. If you find a specific topic or
entry of interest, you can flag it as a favorite, which allows you to easily go
back to the topic at a later date.

utoCAD not only needs hundreds of files to keep itself going, it also
generates more files than you can shake a mouse at. All these files are
important, but none is more important than DWG — the drawing file itself.
In this chapter I cover all the important files that you are likely to run into —
and one or two that you are not likely to run into but should still know what
they are.
It’s also important that both AutoCAD and you are able to find the files you
both need to work together. AutoCAD can usually take care of itself; after it’s
initially installed, all the files the program needs are in appropriate places.
But you need to be able to find your drawing files too, and AutoCAD by itself
is not much help there. Left alone, it will save all your drawings in your My
Documents folder. It’s up to you to organize your storage space, and I give
you some ideas at the end of the chapter about how to go about getting
organized.
File Types in AutoCAD
AutoCAD’s drawing (DWG) files contain everything that you draw, and a bit
more besides. In addition to all those lines, arcs, circles, text, and dimensions,
your DWG files also contain:
✦Style definitions for things such as dimensions and text
✦Properties associated with any graphical objects, such as color, layer,
and linetype

File Types in AutoCAD
66
✦Layer definitions, each of which includes such things as default color,
linetype, plot style; whether or not the objects on the layer are printed/
plotted
Not contained in the DWG file itself, but necessary for it to display properly,
are associated files that define the fonts used by the text and dimension
styles, hatch and linetype patterns, plot-style tables, and more. I cover those
associated files in more detail a few paragraphs from now.
A lot of file interaction is going on when you work in AutoCAD. An important
aspect of drafting in AutoCAD — or any CAD system — is having a good ver-
sion of your drawing to fall back on, in case bad things happen to it. Luckily,
AutoCAD by default creates a backup version of a drawing file every time a
drawing is saved. When you use the Save command, AutoCAD makes a copy
of your drawing (let’s call it FOO.DWG) and renames the copy FOO.BAK.
After the backup is created, AutoCAD takes all the changes that you’ve made
and that are stored in memory, and spoons them into a drawing file. When
it’s finished remembering everything, it saves a new version of FOO.DWG.
Not all programs will do this for you, but AutoCAD does, as long as you do
not tell it not to. I cover that a bit more later in the chapter.
One thing that puzzles new users to AutoCAD is the fact that not all the data
needed to generate a drawing is included in the drawing file. Problems do
not arise if you open your drawings only on your own computer, but they
can crop up if you ever have to send your drawings to someone else. If that
someone else — a client, a contractor, your teacher, or your boss — does
not have all the same files on his or her computer that you did on your com-
puter when you made the drawing, then the drawing is not going to look the
same as it did for you when you drew it.
Here are some of the files external to your DWG file that must be available on
every computer on which the drawing will be opened:
✦Fonts (SHX or TTF or both files): AutoCAD comes with over 70 vector
font files (SHX extension). These fonts are installed in AutoCAD’s own
subfolders in the Program Files folder (usually) on your C: drive.
AutoCAD can also use TrueType (TTF) fonts, which are part of Windows
itself and which live in the Fonts folder of your operating system. I tell
you more about fonts in Book III.
Be careful about using nonstandard fonts — either SHX fonts that did
not come with AutoCAD or TTF fonts that did not come with the
Windows operating system. If you have to send your drawings to some-
one whose computer does not have the fonts you used, AutoCAD will
substitute any missing font with the specified alternate font. Typically
when AutoCAD uses an alternate, the accuracy of the drawing is not
compromised but it will not look the same as it did on your machine.

Book I
Chapter 4
All about Files
File Types in AutoCAD
67
✦Hatch patterns (PAT files): Hatch pattern files are used to generate the
cross-hatching that indicates which objects are cut in a section view or
specific areas on maps or plans. (By default, AutoCAD uses a file named
acad.pat; AutoCAD LT’s version is named acadlt.pat.) Hatching is cov-
ered in depth in Book III.
✦Linetype patterns (LIN files): Linetype pattern files are used to control
the pattern that linework appears in. This file defines noncontinuous
linetypes such as center, dashed, and hidden, which are used in stan-
dard drafting. (By default, AutoCAD uses a file named acad.lin; AutoCAD
LT’s version is named acadlt.lin.) I talk about linetypes in Chapter 6 of
this minibook.
The acad and acadlt hatch pattern and linetype definition files are for
use with imperial units. If you are working in metric units, you use the
acadiso.pat (acadltiso.pat) and acadiso.lin (acadltiso.lin) files. If you
start your drawings correctly, these files are available automatically.
✦Plot-style tables (CTB or STB files): Plot styles are collections of settings
that tell your output device (a highfalutin’ way of saying printer) what
thickness drawing objects should be plotted at, or what properties are
to be assigned to drawing objects when plotting a drawing. (Don’t worry
about plotting for now — I cover it in much greater depth in Book VII.
You can worry about it then!) Plot-style tables are the files where all the
plot styles live, and AutoCAD needs to find them or your drawing will
not plot properly. Plotting in AutoCAD is like printing in other Windows-
based applications, except you are working with larger pages than 81⁄2 x 11
(A4) and 11 x 17 (A3).
✦Image files: AutoCAD can display and print raster images that are
placed in drawing files, but the files do not become part of the drawing
file itself. If AutoCAD can’t find them (say, you forget to send them with
the drawing file), you get a rectangle showing the name of the missing
file instead. I cover working with raster image files in Book VI.
✦Other DWG files: You can attach drawings to other drawings so you do
not have to keep redrawing the same things over and over again. Those
attached drawings are called external references (or xrefs for short).
The idea is that if you change something in a referenced drawing, it auto-
matically changes in all drawings to which it is attached. It’s a useful fea-
ture, but it can be complicated to understand at first (don’t worry — I
reveal all in Book VI!). The point here is that if AutoCAD can’t find the
referenced drawing file, you get another one of those missing file mes-
sages in addition to a helpful string of text that appears in the drawing
to let you know that a referenced drawing is missing.
✦Underlay files: In recent releases, the number of external files that you
can reference has increased. In addition to being able to attach raster
images and xrefs (drawing files), you can attach Design Web Format
(DWF and DWFx) files and MicroStation DGN files. I explain how under-
lay files work in Book VI.

Starting a New Drawing
68
Support for publishing and attaching DWFx files is new in AutoCAD 2009.
I talk more about the benefits of DWFx later in Book VIII.
To summarize, if you are sharing drawings with others outside your office
✦You usually do not have to worry about the font, hatch pattern, or line-
type files if you are using the standard fonts and patterns that come with
AutoCAD.
✦You may have to worry about plot-style tables if you are using custom
ones.
✦You usually do have to worry about images and external references
because you create those files so they’re not part of AutoCAD.
You can use the eTransmit feature to package your drawing files and all
the files that your drawings are dependent on before sharing them with
a client. I cover eTransmitting drawings in Book VII.
Starting a New Drawing
If all that information seems a little daunting at this point, do not worry — all
will be revealed in these pages. In the meantime, it’s just possible that you
might want to get your hands dirty and draw something. So let’s take a look
at a trio of ways to start a new drawing in AutoCAD.
If you are using AutoCAD out of the box (AutoCAD veterans call this the “out-
of-the-box experience”), when you click New on the Quick Access toolbar,
you get the Select Template dialog box (see Figure 4-1). The New button
starts the NEW command.
Figure 4-1:
Select a
template to
start a new
drawing.

Book I
Chapter 4
All about Files
Starting a New Drawing
69
An alternate command that you can use instead of NEW is called QNEW. Who
knew? Here is what QNEW can do for you. If you do not change any settings
in AutoCAD, using QNEW always displays the Select Template dialog box like
the NEW command does. Now, if you always start a drawing by using the
acad.dwt template (not the best idea, but read on), you have to click
acad.dwt, and then click Open. That can get a bit tedious. But if you go into
the Options dialog box and click the Files tab, you can identify a default tem-
plate file (maybe even acad.dwt). Doing so will tell AutoCAD to start a new
drawing by using the specified template every time. I explain how to assign a
template to the QNEW command in Book VIII.
A further wrinkle in starting a new drawing occurs if the system variable
called STARTUP is enabled. By default, STARTUP is disabled or set to 0; for
more on system variables, see the sidebar “AutoCAD system variables” in
Chapter 3 of this minibook.
If STARTUP is enabled (or set to 1), the first time you start AutoCAD you see
a Startup dialog box (see Figure 4-2).
From this dialog box, you can choose to open an existing drawing or start a
new drawing in one of three ways: starting from scratch, using a template, or
employing a wizard. After the first drawing in an AutoCAD session has been
opened by using any of these methods, subsequent uses of the QNEW com-
mand will display the Create New Drawing dialog box. This dialog box looks
suspiciously like the Startup dialog box — it gives you the same three choices
for starting a new drawing, but the icon for opening an existing drawing is
dimmed.
Figure 4-2:
The Startup
dialog box
you see if
STARTUP=1.

Starting a New Drawing
70
The STARTUP system variable must be set to 1 for the Startup and Create
New Drawing dialog boxes to appear when you start AutoCAD or when you
use the QNEW command. If you see the Select Template dialog box only
when you start AutoCAD or use QNEW, your STARTUP variable is disabled.
I suggest you leave STARTUP set to 0, because the other options for starting
a new drawing — that is, from scratch or using a wizard — are much less effi-
cient, as I explain now.
Starting from scratch
When you start a new drawing from scratch, you are starting AutoCAD with
no preconfigured settings. The drawing has no layers other than Layer 0, nor
does it have any text styles, table styles, multileader styles, or dimension
styles other than STANDARD, and no predefined layouts. When you choose
this option, you really do start from scratch, and you must spend a fair
amount of time making settings that you could easily make once and save in
a template file. I explain the importance of template files later in this chapter.
For simple sketching or working out design ideas, it’s okay to start from
scratch, but when you are working on production drawings, it’s a lot more
efficient to use a template. But even starting from scratch is better than
using a wizard.
Using a wizard
Wizards are often powerful and mystical, but the drawing setup wizard is a few
tricks short of being truly magical. I do not mean to disparage all wizards —
AutoCAD has many useful wizards — but the wizard available for starting a
new drawing for you is not one of them. You can choose from two wizards:
Quick and Advanced (see Figure 4-3).
Figure 4-3:
Choose your
wizard.

Book I
Chapter 4
All about Files
Starting a New Drawing
71
The problem with the wizards — both of them — is that the settings they
control for you are not useful. Both wizards will set these values:
✦Units: Choose the format and precision for your linear drawing units (see
Figure 4-4). Regardless of the format you choose, the units are based on
inches if you live in the U.S. or millimeters if you live outside the U.S.
✦Area: Specify the drawing area by its length and width. You arrive at the
correct figures by multiplying the intended plot scale of the drawing by
the dimensions of the paper on which it will be plotted.
In addition to units and area, the Advanced Setup wizard also sets these
values:
✦Angle: Choose the format and precision for angular measure. The
default type of angular measure (and the easiest by far for most people
to work with) is decimal degrees.
✦Angle measure: Specify where in the circle 0 degrees lies. By default, 0
degrees lies due east. If you do not have a compass handy, you can also
think of this direction as 3 o’clock, or to the right in a dead horizontal
alignment.
✦Angle direction: Specify whether angles are measured in a clockwise or
counterclockwise direction. By default, angles are measured in a coun-
terclockwise direction, so if 0 degrees lies on an east-pointing horizontal
axis, 90 degrees is straight up, 180 degrees is horizontal pointing west 
(9 o’clock for you clock watchers), and 270 degrees is straight down.
Nearly all major industries go with the AutoCAD defaults for angular 
measure — that is, 0 degrees is on an easterly horizontal axis and angles are
measured in a counterclockwise direction. One exception to this rule is in
surveying, where 0 degrees usually points north and angles are measured in
Figure 4-4:
Both
wizards (this
is the Quick
one) ask you
to select the
unit type.

Starting a New Drawing
72
a clockwise direction. But if you are not a surveyor (and maybe even if you
are), do not change the settings for angular measure from their defaults,
because it can make editing the drawing a nightmare.
The problem with a drawing setup wizard is that there are so many settings
that define a drawing it’s impossible to capture them all in a single wizard.
By far your best bet is to use one of the drawing templates that AutoCAD
provides or create your own drawing template with the settings that you’ll
want to use when creating a new drawing. I talk briefly about using drawing
templates next and go into more detail about drawing templates in Book VIII.
Using a drawing template
Drawing templates are drawing files with collections of settings and styles
already defined. You should regard the settings that come with AutoCAD as
starting points; some of them may be very close to what you want, but you
need to add the other 5 or 10 percent yourself.
Drawing templates are drawing files — the only difference is the last letter of
the file extension: DWG for regular drawing files and DWT for drawing tem-
plates. By default, AutoCAD is configured to look for drawing templates in
the Documents and Settings folder for the current user profile, although you
can tell the program to look elsewhere. If your company has several drafters,
you may want to create a single set of drawing templates and share them
from a single location on the network, if one is available.
AutoCAD comes with just a little over ten drawing templates, but do not
worry, you do not have to go through them all to find a useful one! Nearly
half of them come in two versions, one configured for color-dependent plot
styles and one for named plot styles (I explain more about plot styles in
Book VII.)
Unless you are told otherwise by your boss or teacher, you should probably
choose one of the color-dependent plot-style drawing template files. Color
dependent means the colors of the objects in the drawing determine how
thick the linework will be plotted. Named plot styles, on the other hand, are
independent of object color, and are specific properties applied to those
objects. I recommend that you stick with color-dependent plot styles because
AutoCAD has used this system since the 1980s to plot drawings, and not all
objects support named plot styles. But I have more to say about all of that in
Book VII.
Following are the types of drawing templates:
✦Standard drawing templates: AutoCAD comes with several standard
drawing templates that are good for both 2D and 3D drawings. The draw-
ing templates are basic, but they lay a good foundation. Two drawing

Book I
Chapter 4
All about Files
Saving a Drawing
73
templates are available for imperial units (acad.dwt and acad -Named
Plot Styles.dwt), and two drawing templates are available for metric
units (acadiso.dwt and acadISO -Named Plot Styles.dwt). Both acad.dwt
and acadiso.dwt are designed for color-dependent plot styles; the other
two drawing templates, as their name implies, are designed for named
plot styles. The drawing templates that come with AutoCAD LT are
acadlt.dwt, acadlt -Named Plot Styles.dwt, acadiso.dwt, and acadltISO -
Named Plot Styles.dwt.
✦3D drawing templates: These drawing templates have some settings
specific to 3D modeling. Four 3D drawing templates are available: two
imperial (acad3D.dwt and acad -Named Plot Styles3D.dwt) and two
metric (acadiso3D.dwt and acadISO -Named Plot Styles3D.dwt). Because
AutoCAD LT does not support 3D modeling, no 3D drawing templates
come with the program.
✦Miscellaneous drawing templates: In addition to the standard and 3D
drawing templates, four other drawing templates can be used as a start-
ing point for creating your own drawing templates if you are in the archi-
tectural or mechanical disciplines.
Which drawing template should you use? That is a trick question because
you should use your own drawing templates and not the ones that come
with AutoCAD. Remember that the supplied drawing templates are just start-
ing points. You’ll need to customize them to make them truly useful time-
savers. I recommend that you take some time and create a drawing template
that holds all your company’s styles and settings.
Saving a Drawing
I do not have to tell you that it’s important to save often. Everyone has their
own little formula for saving: every hour, every 15 minutes, on the solstice
and equinox (and I sincerely hope you are not in the last category!).
Okay, let’s get serious for just a moment. How often should you save your
work? A great mantra to keep in mind — or maybe even print and pin to the
wall over your desk — is, “How much work am I prepared to lose?” You may
have just completed a complicated polar array of a gazillion objects, but it’s
still three minutes away from your quarter-hourly save. Forget the clock —
click that Save button right now! That is how often you should save.
Saving files in AutoCAD can be a little complicated. (By now, you were proba-
bly expecting that, right?) There are three commands for saving files: SAVE,
SAVEAS, and QSAVE, but they all fall naturally to hand (or to tool button, to
be more accurate).

Saving a Drawing
74
Save
AutoCAD does have a command called SAVE, and the Windows-standard
Ctrl+S key combo works here too. But doing a Ctrl+S or clicking the Save
button or menu item does not run the SAVE command. It runs one of two
other commands: SAVEAS, which displays the Save Drawing As dialog box,
or the QSAVE command, which does not display anything.
Save As
If your drawing is unnamed — if the title bar says [Drawing 15.dwg], it’s
unnamed — pressing Ctrl+S or clicking Save in some form runs the SAVEAS
command. SAVEAS opens the Save Drawing As dialog box (see Figure 4-5).
In this dialog box, you can enter three pieces of information:
✦Save in: Use this drop-down list to navigate to the folder where you
want to store the drawing. The list box below the Save in list shows all
drawings stored in the current folder.
✦File name: Enter a name for the drawing. I will have more to say about
naming files at the end of the chapter.

✦Files of type: You want to save a drawing, right? Well, there are draw-
ings, and there are drawings. You can save your work as a DWG in the
current format or go back up to three versions of the DWG file format. If
you have to go back further than that, you can save in Release 12 DXF
format. Finally, you can save your drawing as a drawing template (DWT)
file, or a drawing standards (DWS) file.
The current DWG version is AutoCAD 2007 which is used for AutoCAD 2007,
2008, and 2009. The prior DWG version was AutoCAD 2004, which was used
by AutoCAD 2004, 2005, and 2006. The one prior to that was AutoCAD 2000,
which was used by AutoCAD 2000, 2000i, and 2002. And before that came
AutoCAD R14 (used by that release only). So, if need be, you can save your
work in a DWG format that can be read by a release of AutoCAD first released
in 1997. For more on file formats and releases, see Chapter 2 of this minibook.
You can use the Places list to quickly access named locations and folders
that you commonly use to store drawings. If you frequently use drawings
from a specific folder, you can add it to the Places list. To add a folder to the
Places list, simply drag and drop a folder listed in the files area of the Save
Drawing As dialog box.
DXF: The neutral format
DXF, drawing interchange format, is the officially
sanctioned method for exporting AutoCAD draw-
ing data to other CAD or graphics programs, or
for importing vector graphics from other pro-
grams into AutoCAD. Autodesk publishes the
DXF specification but keeps DWG proprietary.
DXF should produce a close representation of a
DWG file, but some data types do not translate
well; typically drawing geometry is translated
better than some of that geometry’s object prop-
erties. Because DXF is Autodesk’s specification,
it’s up to other software developers to code their
programs to support it properly. In other words, if
your illustration program will not import a DXF
file, the fault is more likely to be the illustration
program’s than Autodesk’s.
DXF files are created through the Save Drawing
As dialog box. In the Files of Type drop-down list,
you can choose from four flavors of DXF:
AutoCAD 2007, AutoCAD 2004, AutoCAD 2000/LT
2000, and AutoCAD Release 12/LT2. You can
open DXF files through a similar Files of Type
drop-down list in the Select File dialog box.
For users of AutoCAD 2004, 2005, and 2006, DXF
is one way (the only way, using plain AutoCAD)
of converting a drawing back to Release 14 or
earlier. AutoCAD 2007 and later can save back
to Release 14 DWG format. If you’re using one of
those older releases, you can download a copy
of Autodesk DWG TrueView from Autodesk’s
Web site that will let you save back to R14 DWG.
If you need to go further back than that, you
really do need to use R12 DXF.

QSAVE
After all those Save and Save As options, QSAVE should come as a relief,
because it has no options. As noted, if a drawing is unnamed, clicking the
Save button on the Quick Access toolbar or pressing Ctrl+S displays the Save
Drawing As dialog box, which presents a plethora of options.
After the drawing is named, clicking the Save button or menu or pressing
Ctrl+S runs the QSAVE command. QSAVE has no dialog box; in fact, it may look
as if nothing happened. QSAVE simply resaves the named drawing file in the
same location, with the same file name, and as the same type of file, all with-
out additional input from you. Any guesses what the Q in QSAVE stands for?
If you are working in an environment with some older and newer releases of
AutoCAD, you can specify the default DWG file format that you save to each
time a drawing is saved. To set the default DWG file format, select the
desired format from the Save As drop-down list on the Open and Save tab of
the Options dialog box.
Opening an Existing Drawing
Opening an existing drawing does not present quite so many possible alter-
natives as creating a new one does. All you have to know is where the draw-
ing is, and if you practice good file-management techniques, that should not
be a problem.
Open command
Clicking the Open button on the Quick Access toolbar or using the Ctrl+O
key combination displays the Select File dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-6.

The default file type in the Files of Type drop-down list is Drawing (*.dwg).
Unlike the Save As dialog box, which gives you a number of DWG versions to
save the drawing to, only one DWG option is listed in the Select File dialog
box. This is because AutoCAD can open any DWG file saved in the current or
older file format.
Your other choices of file types to open through the Select File dialog 
box are
✦Standards (*.dws): A DWS file is a regular drawing file that contains set-
tings and properties that you want to use as a base standard for a proj-
ect or for all your drawings. You can use the CAD Standards options
from Tools on the menu browser to configure a DWS file and to review
your current drawing to make sure it complies with the standards.
✦DXF (*.dxf): Autodesk’s neutral and nonproprietary version of the DWG
format used for transferring drawing data into and out of AutoCAD. For
more information, see the sidebar “DXF: The neutral format.”
✦Drawing Template (*.dwt): A DWT file is a regular drawing file that con-
tains settings, properties, and drawing objects that you want to use in all
the drawing files of a project. Using a template means you do not have to
keep making changes to the settings or drawing those objects over and
over again.
Be careful when opening DWT files, as you may inadvertently make unwanted
changes that will show up whenever you try to start a new drawing based on
that DWT.
Can’t find a drawing file? Funny . . . you knew where it was yesterday, right?
Luckily, AutoCAD has a dandy but well-concealed utility in the Select File
dialog box. To find Find, click the Tools button on the Select File dialog
box’s toolbar, and choose Find from the menu; the Find dialog box opens.
Optionally, enter a file name or a partial file name, and lickety-split,
AutoCAD will turn up files that meet your criteria. (If lickety-split does 
not happen, try changing the Look In location to the root folder.) Entering
no file name in the Named text box will return all drawings in the selected
folder and subfolders if the Include Subfolders option is selected (see
Figure 4-7). Highlight the file you are after in the list and click OK. The Select
File dialog box reappears with the selected file in the File name box, ready
to open.

Recent drawings
Often you might work on the same drawing during the course of a week or a
project. In releases of AutoCAD before AutoCAD 2009, you might have used
the History option under the Places list, which was slow and clunky. The
menu browser allows you to access a list of recent drawing files (see Figure
4-8). To display a list of recently opened drawings, click the Menu Browser
button in the upper-left corner of AutoCAD and hover the cursor over
Recent Documents (a drawing is a form of a document). You can sort the list
of recently opened drawings by name, date, and type. You can also control
the size of the preview of each drawing in the list.

Using Windows Explorer
When you can’t quite remember where you put that danged drawing, the Find
function in AutoCAD’s Select File dialog box works well, but not many people
know about it. Everyone, however, knows Windows Explorer and the Search
tool on the Windows Start menu. If the drawing was created in AutoCAD 2006
or later, you can even search on words that are part of drawing text. This is
not the place to explain the Search function in Windows Vista, XP, or 2000 —
if you do not know how to use it, click Help on the Start button.
After you’ve searched and found the drawing, you can open it and start
AutoCAD at the same time.
And a double-click to open
You can always use Windows Explorer to open your drawings. Simply double-
click to open them in AutoCAD.
One potential drawback of double-clicking in Explorer arises if you have
more than one release of AutoCAD on your computer. If you are a one-person
shop, that may sound unlikely, but lots of big organizations will have two
releases of AutoCAD on their systems while they’re transitioning from one
release to the next. Such a company might have seats of both AutoCAD 
and AutoCAD LT, or “vanilla” AutoCAD alongside a vertical product such as
AutoCAD Architecture, AutoCAD Mechanical, or AutoCAD P&ID. When you
double-click a drawing file in Explorer, the drawing opens with the last-used
version of the software, and that may not be what you want at all. If you have
only one version of AutoCAD, no problem, but if you have access to several
versions, do not do the double-click thing — start your AutoCAD of choice
first, and then use the Open dialog box.
What a drag (and drop)
Perhaps a better way of using Windows Explorer with AutoCAD is dragging
and dropping files into an already running instance of AutoCAD (especially if
you have more than one version on your system).
Be careful where you drop though. If you drag and drop a drawing from
Explorer into an open AutoCAD drawing, the dragged-and-dropped drawing
will be inserted into the already open drawing as a block. If you want to open
a drawing from Explorer by dragging, make sure you do the dropping in an
area of AutoCAD outside the drawing window, as shown in Figure 4-9.

The Multiple-Drawing Environment
80
The Multiple-Drawing Environment
All 21st-century releases of AutoCAD support multiple documents. Big deal,
you say — every Windows program can open multiple documents. Well, it 
is a big deal if you are a grizzled old-timer, because for several releases,
AutoCAD was one of the few Windows programs that did not support multi-
ple documents.
Having several drawings open at once means that you can easily copy objects
from drawing to drawing by using the Windows Clipboard. AutoCAD’s Window
menu lets you arrange several drawings within the application window, either
by cascading them in an overlapping array or by tiling them so each drawing
window is visible.
In addition to using the Window menu on the menu browser or menu bar,
you can also use the Open Documents item listed at the bottom of the menu
browser to switch between open drawings. Hover the cursor over the Open
Documents item to display a list of all the open drawings in AutoCAD, and
then click one of the drawings to make it the current drawing. You can also
click the Quick View Drawings button on the application status bar to open
the Quick View tool to switch between one of the open drawings, save and

Closing Windows
81
close an open drawing, and switch to one of the layouts in an open drawing.
The Quick View tool can also be used to create and open a drawing.
When the Quick View tool is active and if you have a mouse with a scroll
wheel on it, you can change the size of the previews for the drawing or lay-
outs. To change the size of the previews, hover the cursor over the preview
and scroll the wheel on the mouse while holding down the Ctrl key.
If you’re like me, you’ll most likely prefer to have as much of your drawing
visible as possible. In AutoCAD, just like in other Windows programs, you
can have several drawings open and maximized at once. To switch between
them, use the Ctrl+Tab key combination.
A few add-on programs for AutoCAD can’t handle multiple documents; they
will function only if one and only one drawing is open at a time. AutoCAD has
a system variable named SDI (Single Document Interface) that you can
enable if you have one of these ornery add-ons. Set SDI to 1 to disable multi-
ple drawings or to 0 to allow multiple drawings. Note that it’s highly unlikely
that you’ll need to change this variable, and if you do, the add-on’s documen-
tation should tell you so.
Closing Windows
Closing AutoCAD windows is just like closing files in other applications. All
the window types that you look at in Chapter 3 have Close buttons on their
title bars. You can simply click the Close button on a toolbar or palette to
shut it down.
To open toolbars, right-click over a button — it doesn’t matter which — in
any open toolbar to see a shortcut menu of all AutoCAD toolbars. If you’re
after one of the Express Tools toolbars, you need to right-click the Quick
Access toolbar. Choose Toolbars➪EXPRESS and then the toolbar you want to
open. To open a palette, go to the menu browser and choose Tools➪Palettes
and then the palette you want to open. After you’ve been working with the
program a while, try to memorize the Ctrl+key shortcuts; it’s much more effi-
cient toggling Ctrl+1 to open and close the Properties palette, for example,
than to keep opening the menu browser and Tools menu.
If you click the Close button on a drawing window or the Close button on the
AutoCAD title bar, and you have unsaved changes, the program displays an
alert box like the one in Figure 4-10. Click Cancel to go back and save your
changes, click No to close the drawing without saving changes, or click Yes
to save the changes and then close the drawing. If your drawing is unnamed,
the Save Drawing As dialog box appears.

File Management for AutoCAD
82
File Management for AutoCAD
Now that you know what all those files are, how to create new drawings, how
to open existing ones, and how to close everything down, you need to think
about effective file management. When you want to open an existing drawing
file, the Find utility in the Select File dialog box is all very well and good, but
it’s not efficient. It’s much better if you know where you put those drawings
so you do not waste time looking for them. It’s a lot like taking all those
papers that are in piles on your desk and neatly storing them in file folders
in your filing cabinet.
The best approach here is to have a comprehensive organizational scheme
that covers both naming and storage.
Naming drawing files
If you are working on your own, and you produce your own hard-copy 
versions of one-off drawing files, you can name your drawings pretty well
anything you like. If you are an employee in a design or engineering firm,
however, or a student taking a course, you’ll probably need to pay attention
to the file-naming conventions in your organization.
Typically, drawings are seldom one-off — it’s rare that something can be
manufactured or constructed by using a single drawing. When you start
dealing with drawing sets, you need to pay attention to a naming scheme
that keeps all associated files together in your file folders. Individual compa-
nies may have their own system. In the United States, professional organiza-
tions, such as the American Institute of Architects and the Construction
Specifications Institute, produce nonmandatory guidelines for naming CAD
files. Following the AIA file-naming specification may give you drawing
names such as A-FP01 or C-SP04, but even if you do not know the system, a
quick check in the guidelines will tell you that you’re looking at the first
sheet of Architectural Floor Plans, or the fourth sheet of Civil Site Plans.

Web sites:

✦National CAD Standard, www.nationalcadstandard.org
Storing your files
Files go in folders, and it makes as much sense to name your folders sensibly
as it does to name your files in a useful way. If you belong to an organization,
the file storage protocols will already be set up. You’ll probably be saving to
a network — in predefined folders that you may not be able to modify.
If you are on your own, come up with a system that will help you find files
quickly. Obviously, storing files by project is a sensible first step. If you are
really busy (lucky you!), you might consider having the year as a top-level
folder, and then individual projects down a level. Using a similar subfolder
structure can help you find those files, even if it does entail drilling down a
bit. For example, if you design houses, you might have a standard series of
folders named Details, Elevations, Floor Plans, Schedules, Sections, and Site
Plans and residing under each project (see Figure 4-11).
Backing Up Is Hard to Do . . .
. . . but losing a file you’ve spent two days working on is even harder. It’s not
a matter of if you ever need to call on your backups; it’s a matter of when.
Hardware is pretty reliable these days, but disks do fail. Remember that IBM,
or Dell, or HP, or whoever it was that you bought your computer from chose
the lowest bidders as their suppliers.

Backing Up Is Hard to Do . . .
84
I’m not talking about your BAK files now, the ones I explained at the begin-
ning of this chapter. AutoCAD’s own backup files are all well and good, but
they’re not adequate for a backup system.
The likeliest thing to go is your hard drive, and luckily, that is what backup
solutions are meant to protect. Invest in backup hardware; there are many
solutions to choose from out there, so fire up your trusty search engine and
see what you can find on the Web. Among your choices are the following:
✦External hard drives: Especially practical if you have more than one
computer. Some drives are especially designed as backup units and
come with software that lets you schedule and automate backups.
You can also use the built-in Backup utilities that come with Windows
Vista, Windows XP, and Windows 2000.
✦Tape drives: Tape is fairly obsolete now, and I do not recommend buying
a new tape backup unit. But if it’s all you have, it’s better than nothing!
✦Removable disks: The best known of these devices is Iomega’s Zip
Drive; the drives themselves can be internal or external, and the propri-
etary disks come in 100MB, 250MB, and 750MB capacities.
✦CD-Rs and DVD-Rs: Compact Disc-Recordable and Digital Versatile Disc-
Recordable disks are cheap and efficient means to backing up data up to
about 700MB. Most computers purchased in the last five years come
with CD-RW drives, so the investment here is minimal.
✦Blu-ray and HD-DVDs: CDs and DVDs are nice, but with file size and
project complexity increasing, it might be time to think about the next
generation of compact discs for data storage. Blu-ray and HD-DVDs are
pretty new in the computing space compared to other formats but have
been used for high-definition movies for the past few years. Although
hardware costs are still high for these media formats, the amount of
storage space can justify the cost differences. Blu-ray discs can hold
about 50GB, while an HD-DVD can hold 30GB of data.
✦USB memory keys: A great idea, and now amazingly cheap. These pen-
sized devices plug into a spare USB port and are seen by Windows Vista
and Windows XP as just another drive.
How often should you back up your hard drive? It’s worth revisiting that ear-
lier question: “How much work do I want to lose?” Now, I’m not suggesting
that you run a full system backup every 15 minutes, but once a day, at the
end of the day, is not excessive. If your hard drive does crash at your after-
noon coffee break, you might have lost your day’s work, but you can always
use yesterday’s backup.
If you have one.

I
n this chapter, I look at some of AutoCAD’s primitive drawing objects.
That is not an insult to the cavemen who might still be walking among us;
by primitive I mean basic drawing elements such as lines, arcs, and circles. I
get to complex drawing objects, such as polylines in Book II, multiline text,
tables and dimensions in Book III, and blocks in Book VI.
The purpose of this chapter is to show you how to draw stuff as simply as
possible. Remember that the purpose of a CAD drawing is to convey techni-
cal information accurately and precisely (and those two words do not mean
the same thing!). This chapter shows you how to draw primitives but does
not show you the best way to manage and apply object properties. When
you create your own drawings, you need to pay attention to precision as
well as object properties such as color, linetype, and layer, which all affect
the output of the drawing.
Drawing Lines
Lines are the second most-basic object you can create in AutoCAD. Lines are
geometrically defined in AutoCAD by two coordinate points that are used as
the start and endpoint of the line. The only thing simpler than a line is a
point object, which is defined by a single set of coordinate values. (Do not
be too concerned about coordinates at this point — I tell all in Chapter 7 of
this minibook.)
Lines are the fundamental building blocks of most types of drawing, espe-
cially if you work in architecture or general building design. If you do
mechanical drafting, you may draw as many circular shapes as straight ones
(in that case, do I have a paragraph coming up for you — hang on tight!). If
you do civil-engineering drawings or mapping, you’re probably lucky if you

Drawing Lines
86
see a straight line once every six months. But whatever kind of drafting you
do, at some point you’ll need to draw lines.
You would think that a line is a line is a line, wouldn’t you? But not when it
comes to CAD in general and AutoCAD. What looks like a line may or may
not be a line — meaning a line object. Straight, linear-looking thingies on
your drawing screen may also be polyline objects, or components of a multi-
line object. They may even be part of a table object. I cover all the various
types of lines later in the book, but what I cover here is the primitive line
object.
You draw primitive line objects with a command called . . . wait for it . . .
LINE! You can start this command in a number of ways:
✦Ribbon: On the ribbon, click the Home tab➪Draw panel➪Line.
✦Menu browser: Click the Menu browser button. On the menu browser,
click Draw➪Line.
✦Menu bar: On the menu bar, click Draw menu➪Line.
✦Toolbar: On the Draw toolbar, click the Line tool.
✦Keyboard input: Type LINE (either uppercase or lowercase, it does not
matter which; as I explained in the Introduction, I show proper com-
mand names in all uppercase in this book). When you finish typing the
command, press Enter.
✦Command alias: More typing (actually, less typing). Type L and press
Enter.
✦Tool palettes: You find the LINE command (and a few others) on the
Draw tab of the Tool palettes. If you do not see the tab, right-click the
title bar of the Tool Palettes window and choose either 3D Make or All
Palettes.
AutoCAD offers a large number of command aliases that can be used as an
alternative to typing the full name of a command or using one of the user
interface elements to start a command. L is the alias for the LINE command,
so typing either LINE (the full command name) or L (the command alias)
and then pressing Enter both do the same thing: They run the LINE com-
mand. You can probably figure out a lot of aliases for yourself: C for CIRCLE,
A for ARC, Z for ZOOM, and so on. For a complete list of AutoCAD’s com-
mand aliases, on the menu browser or menu bar click Tools menu➪
Customize➪Edit Program Parameters (acad.pgp) to open the program
parameters file in Windows Notepad or your configured text editor. If you’re
using AutoCAD LT, click Tools menu➪Customize➪Edit Program Parameters
(acadlt.pgp).

The following procedure uses the ribbon to start the LINE command and
draws a line by using two random points in the drawing window:
1. On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Draw panel➪Line.
AutoCAD starts the LINE command. The command displays the prompt:
Specify first point:
2. Specify the first point of the line by clicking a point in the drawing
window.
AutoCAD starts drawing a line from the point you chose. As you move
the cursor, a temporary line segment (see Figure 5-1) joins the first point
with the crosshairs. AutoCAD prompts:
Specify next point or [Undo]:
The second prompt displays a command option inside a pair of square
brackets. To enter a command option at the command line, type the
uppercase letter or letters of the option. In this case, typing U and press-
ing Enter runs the LINE command’s Undo option; this option undoes the
previous line segment and backs up AutoCAD to the line’s start point.

88
If you’re using dynamic input (that is, when Dynamic Input is enabled on
the status bar), a downward arrow in the dynamic input tooltip is dis-
played when command options are available. Press the down-arrow key
when you see the downward arrow on the dynamic input tooltip to
access the available command options. Because command options are
not displayed as part of the dynamic input tooltip, tooltip looks like the
following when you’re prompted for the next point of the line:
Specify next point or
3. Specify additional points by clicking them in the drawing window.
Notice that AutoCAD does not end the LINE command after you’ve
drawn a single line. You can keep clicking points in the drawing window,
and AutoCAD will keep adding line segments to your drawing.
After you click a third point, the command line changes slightly:
Specify next point or [Close/Undo]:
Two options appear inside the pair of square brackets for the command
prompt. The Undo option is still available, but a new option called Close
appears as well.
4. Press C and then press Enter to close the shape.
AutoCAD locates the next point based on the first point you chose after
the LINE command was started. By using the Close option, you can make
a closed triangular or polygonal shape. AutoCAD ends the LINE com-
mand and returns you to a blank command line.
Refer to Figure 5-1 to see the command in process; notice the command
line and the dynamic input tooltip, both showing command options.
When you enter C to create a closed shape, what you end up with is a series
of separate line objects. If you click your mouse pointer on top of any line
segment, you see that only that part of the shape is selected. In Book II, I
look at another entity type called a polyline, where all the line segments form
a single continuous object.
Creating Circles
Circles, like lines and every other drawing object in AutoCAD, are mathemat-
ically defined. Lines are defined by the coordinates of their endpoints.
Circles are defined by the coordinates of the center point and a specified
numeric value for the radius.
The default method of drawing circles in AutoCAD is by selecting a center
point on-screen and then entering a number for the radius. But you can draw
circles in a half-dozen ways. Figure 5-2 shows these options on the Draw
menu.

Book I
Chapter 5
Basic Tools
Creating Circles
89
The options are
✦Center, Radius: Select a center point in the drawing window, and then
either enter a value for the radius or drag a second point from the center
point to indicate the radius. This is the default method for drawing 
circles.
In this case, default means what happens when you start the CIRCLE
command without specifying a command option.
✦Center, Diameter: Select a center point in the drawing window, and then
either enter a value for the diameter or drag a second point from the
center point to indicate the diameter. Because it’s a diameter distance
that you’re dragging, the second point is twice as far from the center as
the circumference.
✦2 Points: Specify two points in the drawing window; the two points are
treated as endpoints of the diameter of the circle.
✦3 Points: Specify three points in the drawing window; a circle is drawn
through the selected points.
✦Tan, Tan, Radius: Select two existing objects, and then enter a value for
the radius. AutoCAD draws a circle tangent to the two selected objects
with the specified radius (assuming such a circle is possible).
✦Tan, Tan, Tan: Select three existing objects and, geometry permitting,
AutoCAD draws a circle tangent to all three of them. This one is not
really an option of the CIRCLE command but a special macro that uses
the 3 Points option in combination with the Tangent object snap.
Any of these options will create a circle, but which one you choose depends
on the drawing geometry and the information you have. For example, if
you’re given the requirement for a circle of diameter 29.57137, it’s easier to
use the CIRCLE command’s Diameter option than it is to dig out your calcula-
tor and divide 29.57137 by 2 to get the radius.
Figure 5-2:

The following steps use the ribbon to start the CIRCLE command, and then
draw a circle by using the Diameter option:
1. On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Draw panel➪Circle flyout➪Circle,
Radius.
AutoCAD starts the CIRCLE command. The command displays the
prompt
Specify center point for circle or [3P/2P/Ttr (tan tan
radius)]:
If you want to use one of the available options, enter 3P for a 3-point
circle, 2P for a 2-point circle, or T to use the Tan, Tan, Radius option.
You need to type the uppercase letters of the command option you
want. For 2-point and 3-point, press P after the 2 or 3, or AutoCAD thinks
you’re trying to enter a numeric coordinate location. If you’re using
dynamic input, press the down-arrow key to access the available com-
mand options.
2. Specify the center point.
AutoCAD places the center of the circle and drags a rubber-band line
between the center point and the crosshairs; the command displays the
prompt
Specify radius of circle or [Diameter]:
If you simply choose a point or enter a value at this point, AutoCAD
interprets the input as the radius. If you want to use the Diameter
option, you must let AutoCAD know.
3. Press D and then press Enter.
Entering D lets AutoCAD know you want to use the Diameter option of
the CIRCLE command. The command displays the prompt
Specify diameter of circle:
4. Enter a numeric value for the diameter and press Enter, or drag the
crosshairs to indicate a length equivalent to the diameter and then
click.
AutoCAD draws the circle.
The steps in this and the preceding section show how to draw two of the
simplest object types in AutoCAD. The procedures used to draw most
objects in AutoCAD are basically similar. I look at drawing other kinds of
objects in Chapter 1 of Book II.

Taking a Closer Look
One of the great advantages of AutoCAD is that you work on an infinitely
large drawing sheet — so large, in fact, that you could design a solar system
full size! With a drawing sheet that size, though, you need to be able to get
up close to the drawing objects to add detail. Enter the display commands.
There are three broad categories of display commands: ZOOM, PAN, and
VIEW. I look at all of them in detail in Book II. Here, I show you just enough of
the basics so you can navigate around your drawing (or one of AutoCAD’s
sample drawings).
I begin with the two realtime navigation commands, RTZOOM and RTPAN.
They’re called realtime commands because you can see the view of the draw-
ing change in real time as you use the commands.
Checking out realtime zoom
Using realtime zoom allows you to increase or decrease the magnification of
the objects in a drawing. To make drawing objects appear larger, you zoom
in; to make them appear smaller, you zoom out.
When you zoom in to or out of a drawing, you make drawing objects look
larger or smaller by moving your viewpoint farther away or closer, respec-
tively. You’re not changing the size of the objects themselves. When I cover
the Modify commands in Book II, you discover the SCALE command, which
allows you to make objects smaller or larger by changing their size.
You can initiate realtime zoom in a number of ways. Perhaps the easiest is to
click the Zoom button on the application status bar and then press Enter.
When you start either Realtime Zoom or Realtime Pan, the crosshairs are
replaced by a magnifying glass cursor or a hand cursor, respectively. Right-
clicking displays a shortcut menu that lets you switch from Zoom to Pan and
vice versa. The shortcut menu has three other options of the ZOOM com-
mand, as well as a link to the 3DORBIT command if you’re using AutoCAD
and not AutoCAD LT. For the time being, I focus on the flat two-dimensional
world, but I cover 3DORBIT in Book V, Chapter 3.
Using realtime pan
Panning in a drawing changes the view without changing the magnification.
To initiate realtime pan, click the Pan button on the application status bar. A
right-click while in Realtime Pan mode displays the same shortcut menu as
Realtime Zoom, although there are no specific panning options.

Taking a Closer Look
92
To zoom and pan in a drawing, follow these steps:
1. Open a drawing.
You can open one of your own drawings, the drawing you created in
Chapter 1 of this minibook, or a sample drawing such as Architectural —
Annotation Scaling and Multileaders.dwg found in the \Program Files\
AutoCAD 2009\Sample folder (or the \Program Files\AutoCAD LT 2009\
Sample folder for those using AutoCAD LT 2009).
2. Click the Model tab at the lower-left corner of the drawing window or
the Model button on the application status bar.
Realtime panning and zooming work in layouts as well as in the Model
tab, but to keep it simple for now, we’ll stay with the Model tab. I cover
Model and layout tabs (also known as model space and paper space) in
the Chapter 6 of this minibook.
3. Click the Zoom button (the one with the magnifying glass) on the
application status bar and then press Enter.
You can’t use any other command while using realtime zoom or pan. The
command prompt displays
Press ESC or ENTER to exit, or right-click to display
shortcut menu.
4. Move the magnifying glass cursor to the middle of the drawing
window, and then hold the left mouse button and drag the cursor
downward, and then upward.
Dragging the magnifying glass cursor upward increases the magnifica-
tion of the current view, making the drawing objects appear closer; drag-
ging it downward decreases the magnification of the current view,
making drawing objects appear farther away.
5. Right-click to display the shortcut menu shown in Figure 5-3 and
choose Pan.
The magnifying glass cursor changes to the hand cursor; you’re now in
realtime pan mode, just as if you had started the Pan Realtime command
from the application status bar.

6. Hold down the left mouse button and drag the cursor to pan the draw-
ing back and forth, or up and down around the display.
You can toggle back and forth between realtime panning and zooming by
right-clicking at any time and choosing the other mode.
7. Right-click and choose Zoom Original to return to the original view of
the drawing, before you started the Realtime Zoom command.
This is a quick way to get back to where you started, in case you get lost
with all the panning and zooming. I describe the other two Zoom options
on the shortcut menu — Zoom Window and Zoom Extents — in Book II,
Chapter 3.
8. Right-click and choose Exit.
The hand cursor or magnifying glass cursor is replaced by the standard
AutoCAD crosshairs, and the command line looks like this:
Press ESC or ENTER to exit, or right-click to display
shortcut menu.
Command:
These are only the very basics of panning and zooming from the Zoom (or
Pan) button on the application status bar. I cover the remaining zoom
options — and there are several — in Book II.
Modifying Objects
AutoCAD provides three ways to modify objects:
✦Starting a command, and then selecting objects: The technical term for
this form of editing is verb/noun selection. You specify what you want to
do — such as erase objects — and then specify what objects you want
to perform the action on.
✦Selecting objects, and then starting a command: The technical term for
this form of editing is noun/verb selection. You specify what objects you
want to perform an action on and then you specify the action you want
to perform.
✦Grip editing: When you select an object by clicking it and no command
is active, you see one or more little blue boxes on the object. These are
called grips. If you click one of the blue boxes (called cold grips), it turns
red (or hot) and you can access a range of editing commands without
needing to start a command first. Book II is the place to go for more
information on modifying objects with grips.

Erasing and Unerasing Stuff
94
For now, I’m going to stick with the most basic way of modifying objects —
start a Modify command, and then select the objects to modify. If you master
only one of these three methods, this is the one, because every Modify com-
mand supports modifying objects in this way. Not all the Modify commands
allow you to first select objects and then start a command — noun/verb
selection — and even fewer work with grips.
Erasing and Unerasing Stuff
When you’re not creating objects or navigating a drawing, you’ll be spending
the majority of your time modifying objects that you’ve already drawn.
Modifying means copying, stretching, rotating — and getting rid of mistakes.
Mistake is such a harsh word that I prefer saying “alterations that others feel
should be made to a design” — after all, a mistake is often a matter of opin-
ion and can sometimes lead to design innovation.
Using the digital eraser
You can do a wide range of things with objects in your drawing. You can
move them, copy them, rotate them, scale them, and mirror them. But
maybe they’re objects that were used for constructing other objects or fea-
tures that are no longer needed. In this case, anything you want to remove,
delete, expunge, annihilate . . . erase them. Here’s how:
1. Open a drawing.
You can open one of your own drawings, the drawing you created in
Chapter 1 of this minibook, or a sample drawing such as Architectural —
Annotation Scaling and Multileaders.dwg found in the \Program Files\
AutoCAD 2009\Sample folder (or the \Program Files\AutoCAD LT 2009\
Sample folder for those using AutoCAD LT 2009).
2. Click the Model tab at the lower-left corner of the drawing window or
the Model button on the application status bar.
Again, this will go more easily if the Model tab is current.
3. On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Modify panel➪Erase.
AutoCAD starts the ERASE command. The command displays the follow-
ing prompt:
Select objects:
4. Select two or three objects by clicking each one.

Book I
Chapter 5
Basic Tools
Erasing and Unerasing Stuff
95
5. AutoCAD highlights the objects by displaying them in dashed
linework and displays the prompts:
Select objects: 1 found
Select objects: 1 found, 2 total
Select objects: 1 found, 3 total
Select objects:
AutoCAD continues adding objects that you select to the current selec-
tion set. I talk more about selecting objects in Book II, Chapter 2.
6. When you finish selecting objects to erase, press Enter.
The selected objects are erased from the drawing.
These steps are typical for any modifying operation in AutoCAD. The most
important thing to remember is that you must press Enter when you finish
selecting objects to complete the command or proceed to the next prompt.
Unerasing objects
Everyone makes mistakes, from time to time, including erasing objects in a
drawing that really shouldn’t have been erased. Although you can’t easily
unerase something that occurred in the real world, AutoCAD is more forgiv-
ing and allows you to unerase objects that you have unintentionally
removed.
Like most Windows-based programs, AutoCAD has an UNDO command (cov-
ered in the next section). The problem with UNDO is that you can’t selec-
tively skip over a bunch of stuff to get back to the action that you really want
to undo. Say, for example, that you erased a wall and then drew a new wall in
a different place, and then copied some bathroom fixtures, and then zoomed
and panned — and then you realized you never should have erased that
original wall in the first place. AutoCAD will let you undo back to just before
that crucial erasure. Unfortunately, it will also undo the pan, the zoom, the
copied bathroom fixtures, and the new wall drawn in a different place that
you really want to keep, all before it will undo that erasure.
There’s a little-known command that is appropriately named OOPS. It’s little
known because it doesn’t appear in the user interface on a toolbar, menu, or
any other place. You have to know it’s there, and you have to type the com-
mand at the command prompt. OOPS performs one single task: It unerases
the last thing you erased. So, in the scenario I just mentioned, if you had
entered OOPS instead of undoing all the previous commands, the view you
got by panning and zooming, and those copied bathroom fixtures as well as
that new wall would all be retained, and the wall that you never should have
erased would be restored — because it was the last thing you erased, and
that is exactly what OOPS is for. Remember OOPS. Write it down on a yellow
sticky note and stick it up on your monitor. If anyone asks, you can tell them
it’s your mantra.

Ready . . . Undo, Undo, Redo . . .
96
Ready . . . Undo, Undo, Redo . . .
Like all good Windows programs, AutoCAD has Undo and Redo functions.
However, the UNDO command in AutoCAD is more complex than the one in
most other programs. You can undo the most recent action or multiple
actions, and it offers many more options as well.
The simplest way to run UNDO is to use the Windows Ctrl+Z shortcut. You
can also type U at the command prompt and press Enter, or click the Undo
button on the Quick Access toolbar.
If you enter UNDO at the command prompt and press Enter, you get the full-
blown UNDO command. The command prompt looks like this:
Current settings: Auto = On, Control = All, Combine = Yes,
Layer = Yes
Enter the number of operations to undo or
[Auto/Control/BEgin/End/Mark/Back] <1>:
I have more to say about UNDO in Book II.
Right next door to the Undo button on the Quick Access toolbar is the Redo
button. In the latest versions of AutoCAD, you can redo multiple undos —
great if you need to redo multiple undo operations.

utoCAD is much more than an electronic sketchpad. Technical drawings —
as I’m sure you’re aware — need to be accurate, precise, neat enough to be
read easily, and standardized. Chapter 7 covers precision drawing techniques.
This chapter explains how to set up drawings and introduces a number of
ways to ensure standardization — ways that help you draw more efficiently
and make all the drawings you create look similar to one another.
Choosing Units of Measurement
In this book, when I discuss units of measurement in AutoCAD, I’m not talking
about systems of measurement. It’s important to keep those two separate.
Globally speaking, two main systems of measurement are in use today.
Imperial or English measurement is based on inches, and metric measure is
based on the meter (or metre, if you live outside the United States).
Several releases back, AutoCAD used the measurement units of English and
metric. Starting with AutoCAD 2000, the terminology switched from English
to Imperial units. Although English and Imperial liquid measurements have
some slight differences, these differences are likely not to bother most
AutoCAD users who deal in linear and angular measure. For example, a U.S.
pint has 16 ounces and a U.K. pint has 20 ounces, but a foot in both countries
contains 12 inches. Come to think of it, maybe it would bother the U.K.
AutoCAD user who has just ordered a pint of Guinness in the U.S.!

Choosing Units of Measurement
98
The metric system is being adopted in virtually every country in the world,
but some are taking longer than others to embrace it. The biggest holdout —
if you haven’t guessed it already — is the United States. Rumor has it, in fact,
that the United States, Liberia, and Myanmar are the last countries in the
world using English (or is that Imperial?) units.
Talking about units in AutoCAD can be confusing. It’s worth establishing
some definitions before I get to the nitty-gritty:
✦Units: Units is a generic term in AutoCAD, and it can cause a lot of confusion
to both newbies and experienced users; it’s best if you state specifically
what kind of units you mean.
• Real-world units: Real-world units are the units you measure things
with every day. These units may be inches or miles, or millimeters or
kilometers, or yards or nautical miles. Real-world units are established
components of a uniform system of measure such as the metric system.
• AutoCAD units: AutoCAD, like all CAD programs, works by crunching
numbers, and numbers generally don’t have real-world units attached
to them — they’re just numbers. AutoCAD units can be formatted so
that they look like real-world units, but internally, they’re just num-
bers that represent an angle or a linear distance. A line 1 unit in length
might represent two different lengths due to how units are represented
in the drawing, but measure the same length virtually. A line 1 unit
long could represent 1 inch or 1 mile.
✦Unit types: There are two types of AutoCAD units: linear and angular.
✦Unit formats: Each of the two unit types can be formatted in one of five
ways, as shown in Table 6-1.
✦System of measure: Globally, the most widely used system of measure is
the metric system. Locally (if you’re a North American, that is), the
English (or Imperial) system of measure is much more widely used.
These are the two systems of measure I focus on in this book, and I
assume the vast majority of readers are on the same pages.

Regarding Table 6-1:
✦All linear examples are equivalent to one another, and all angular examples
are equivalent to one another.
✦Architectural units in AutoCAD mean feet and fractional inches. Of
course, architects outside the United States and Canada will have to
configure decimal units if they want to work in metric units.
✦Surveyor units in AutoCAD mean quadrant bearings (for example, North
30 degrees West), but quadrant bearings are used only by American sur-
veyors. Surveyors in other parts of the world work in whole circle bear-
ings in either decimal degrees (for example, 120.000°) or Deg/Min/Sec
(for example, 120d00' 00.0").
✦The default precision for Angular units is zero places; Table 6-1 shows
the results of setting three places of precision.
Despite the large number of choices, chances are you’ll be working in either
architectural (feet-and-fractional inches) or decimal linear units, and decimal
degree or possibly deg/min/sec angular units.
Don’t be fooled by those foot-and-inch marks you see if you configure AutoCAD
to display architectural or engineering units. AutoCAD uses inch marks on
every unit, and whenever it reaches 12 of those, it adds a foot value and foot
mark. It may look like 1'–4 1/2" to you, but to AutoCAD it’s just 16.500.
If you’re working in architectural units, remember that AutoCAD represents
linear values in an inch. If you want to enter 6", entering 6 is enough. If you
want to enter 6', you need to include the foot mark. If you don’t use a foot
mark, AutoCAD assumes that you want to use inches.
AutoCAD units
AutoCAD ignores the differences between metric and English/Imperial units
because it doesn’t actually work in either. In AutoCAD, the fundamental unit
is . . . the unit. It’s up to you, the AutoCAD user, to determine what kind of
real-world units AutoCAD units represent.
Unless specifically labeled otherwise, AutoCAD’s drawing templates have
their units format (not their units type) set to decimal units, with four places
of precision. Those decimal units can represent any real-world unit you
want, such as decimal inches, decimal meters, or decimal miles.
When you set the format for units in the Drawing Units dialog box, you control
the display of units in the coordinate display on the status bar, the Properties
palette, the command line, and the dynamic input tooltip when you draw new
objects or query existing ones. You do not affect the display of dimension
values. To see how to format dimension values, see Book III.

Choosing Units of Measurement
100
Imperial or metric
Despite the previous discussion on AutoCAD units versus real-world units,
you still need to determine upfront whether you’re working in metric or
Imperial (or is it English?) units. Remember, as far as AutoCAD is concerned,
a unit is a unit is a unit.
Choosing a metric or Imperial default beforehand can make your drafting
more efficient. Why? Because if you start a drawing with Imperial defaults,
AutoCAD is automatically configured to use the Imperial hatch pattern and
linetype definition files, and if you start out with metric defaults, AutoCAD is
automatically configured for the metric equivalents.
AutoCAD uses external definition files for its hatch patterns and linetype pat-
terns. For hatch patterns, AutoCAD has two files, acad.pat and acadiso.pat.
Similarly for linetype pattern definitions, the two files are named acad.lin and
acadiso.lin. (The equivalent files in AutoCAD LT are acadlt.pat, acadltiso.pat,
acadlt.lin, and acadltiso.lin.) I discuss using linetypes later in this chapter. See
Book III, Chapter 3 for more on applying hatch patterns closed objects in a
drawing.
Here’s how to determine whether to start with a metric-defaults drawing or
an Imperial-defaults drawing template:
✦To set Imperial defaults, start with the acad.dwt (acadlt.dwt in AutoCAD LT)
template. To set metric defaults, start with the acadiso.dwt (acadltiso.dwt)
template.
✦Start with no template by clicking the down arrow to the right of the
Open button in the Select Template dialog box. Choose Open with No
Template — Imperial to create a drawing using the Imperial default set-
tings; choose Open with No Template — Metric to create a drawing
using the metric default settings.
System variables
You need to know about two system variables, especially if you work in both
Imperial and metric systems of measure. If you work exclusively in one or
the other, it still doesn’t hurt to know about them, but you can file them in a
dustier, less-visited part of your brain. (For more on system variables, see
Chapter 3 of this minibook.)
✦MEASUREMENT: This variable allows the values of either 0 (Imperial
units) or 1 (metric units). The MEASUREMENT variable is stored in each
drawing, which means that you can work with drawings based in either
Imperial or metric units.

Book I
Chapter VI
Setting Up
Drawings
Choosing Units of Measurement
101
✦MEASUREINIT: This variable also allows the values of either 0 (Imperial
units) or 1 (metric units). MEASUREINIT is stored in the system registry and
determines whether drawings started from scratch (without a template)
call on the acad (acadlt) or acadiso (acadltiso) pattern and linetype files.
As long as you start your drawings from the appropriate template files (that
is, acad.dwt or acadlt.dwt for Imperial units, or acadiso.dwt or acadltiso.dwt
for metric units), the MEASUREMENT system variable is set correctly automat-
ically. The value of the MEASUREINIT variable is set when you install AutoCAD;
by default, it’s set to 0 for Imperial units if you live in the United States, and 1
for metric units if you live anywhere else in the world.
Setting units in your drawing
The following steps show how to set architectural linear units and
deg/min/sec angular units for your current drawing:
1. On the menu browser, click Format menu➪Units.
AutoCAD displays the Drawing Units dialog box (see Figure 6-1).
2. In the Length area, click the Type drop-down list box and then choose
Architectural.
The Precision drop-down list box and Sample Output display change to
show feet and fractional inches.
Figure 6-1:

3. In the Length area, click the Precision drop-down list box and choose
the desired precision format.
The acceptable range of values is 0'–0" to 0'–0 1/256".
You are not setting dimension format here. You never see a drawing
dimensioned to the nearest 256th of an inch, but you might want to see
more precision when you’re drawing.
For now, ignore the drop-down list box in the Insertion Scale area; I
cover insert units in Book VI. Also, ignore the drop-down list in the
Lighting area for now; I cover lighting in Book V.
4. In the Angle area, click the Type drop-down list box and choose
Deg/Min/Sec.
The Precision list box and Sample Output display change to show
degrees-minutes-seconds.
5. In the Angle area, click the Precision drop-down list box and choose
the desired precision format.
Setting the maximum precision in the drop-down list formats angular
units to degrees, minutes, and seconds to four decimal places.
The Clockwise check box allows you to define the direction in which angles are
measured. By default, angles are measured in a counterclockwise direction — 0
is to the right, 90 is up, 180 is to the left, and 270 is down in a drawing. The
angular direction of 0 degrees can also be changed in the Direction Control
dialog box, which is displayed by the Direction button located at the bottom
of the Drawing Units dialog box.
Setting Limits for Your Drawings
Well, you don’t want your drawings staying out all night, do you? Or borrow-
ing the car and leaving it in the impound lot?
Okay, the limits that you establish for your kids will not have the same effect
on AutoCAD. In AutoCAD, the limits of a drawing define the working area of a
drawing. But you’ve already seen in Chapter 2 of this minibook that you have
an unlimited drawing area in AutoCAD, so why does it now have limits?
It may not make a lot of sense to pay strict attention to limits when you can
change those limits whenever you want. In fact, limits are an historical artifact
in AutoCAD and have a somewhat limited use on modern systems.
All the same, it’s not a bad idea to know how big your drawing area is, even
though it can be infinitely large and infinitely flexible. That’s because sooner
or later you’re going to want to print that drawing, and that means you’re
going to have to fit it onto a piece of paper.

Book I
Chapter VI
Setting Up
Drawings
Setting Limits for Your Drawings
103
The theory behind limits is that you set your drawing limits according to the
sheet size on which you’ll eventually plot your drawing. So if you’re drawing
a mouse pad, you might set your drawing limits to 11 × 8 1/2 inches so that
the limits represent a letter-size sheet. If you’re drawing a fax machine, you
set the drawing limits to 36 × 24 inches, to represent a D-size sheet.
Here are some other reasons to set limits for your drawing:
✦Defining the grid: AutoCAD can display a grid of horizontally and verti-
cally aligned dots over an area in a drawing. This grid can help keep you
aware of the relative sizes of what you’re drawing and the size of the
printed drawing. I cover the grid in detail in Chapter 7 of this minibook,
but for now, the key point is that the grid will be displayed over the area
defined by the drawing limits.
✦Zooming: One option of the ZOOM command is All, which changes the
viewpoint of the drawing so you see everything within the drawing limits
in the drawing window. This can be useful if you want to see some white
space (or black space, depending on the background color of the draw-
ing window) around your drawing objects.
✦Plotting: If you want to plot a drawing from the Model tab (I discuss the
Model tab in the “Lost in Space: Model or Paper?” section later in this
chapter, and I cover plotting drawings in Book VII), one of the options is
Limits. Choosing Limits plots everything within the defined limits of the
drawing.
Pay attention to the order of those values. In AutoCAD, the horizontal dimen-
sion always comes before the vertical, so a 24 × 36-inch sheet would be
aligned in portrait (long side vertical) mode, and a 36 × 24-inch sheet would
be aligned in landscape (long side horizontal) mode.
So far so good, but it gets a little more complicated when you start drawing
things that won’t fit on a sheet of paper at their full size — no matter how big
the paper is. For more on scaling, see the “Understanding Drawing Scale”
section a bit later on in this chapter.
You specify the drawing limits by entering coordinates for the lower-left and
upper-right corners of the drawing area. The following procedure shows you
how to set your drawing’s limits:
1. On the menu browser, click Format menu➪Drawing Limits, or type
LIMITS at the command prompt and press Enter.
AutoCAD starts the LIMITS command. The command displays the
prompt
Reset Model space limits:
Specify lower left corner or [ON/OFF] <0.0000,0.0000>:

Understanding Drawing Scale
104
2. Press Enter to accept 0,0 as the lower-left corner, or type a different
two-dimensional coordinate value and press Enter.
It’s a good idea to accept the default value (0,0) for the lower-left limit. 0,0
is the origin of the coordinate system. Chapter 7 covers the coordinate
system in detail.
AutoCAD then prompts
Specify upper right corner <12.0000,9.0000>:
3. Type a new value in coordinates for the upper-right corner of the
drawing limits and then press Enter, or press Enter to accept the cur-
rent value.
Understanding Drawing Scale
Just now, I talked about drawing mouse pads and fax machines, objects you
can carry around easily and that will fit on a letter-size or D-size drawing
sheet. Most of the time, however, you’re going to be drawing things that
won’t fit very well, or won’t fit at all, on a sheet of paper. To make your draw-
ing objects fit on the sheet, you use a scale factor when plotting a drawing.
You know that AutoCAD has an infinitely large sheet of virtual paper at its
disposal. You’ve just found out that if your virtual drawing sheet isn’t big
enough, you can just make it bigger by altering the drawing limits. This is a
great system — until you have to produce a hard copy of your drawing.
Scaling on the drawing board
In manual drafting, you’re given a sheet of paper on which to lay out a drawing.
Assume that it’s an ISO A1 sheet that measures 841 × 594mm. By the time
you’ve taken margins and room for a border and title block into account, you’re
left with a drawing area of, say, 550mm × 475mm.
Now suppose that you’ve been given a floor plan to draw. The building meas-
ures 45 meters × 70 meters. Obviously, you’re not going to draw that building
full size on an A1 sheet. You need to figure out a reduction factor that lets you
draw your detailed plan of the building to an approved drafting scale and fit it
on the sheet. You decide that the floor plan will fit on the sheet at a scale of
1:20. So you dig out your drafting scale, flip it around to the 1:20 scale, and
start laying out your sheet.
When drawing manually, you scale everything down as you draw. Otherwise,
things won’t fit on the page. The opposite is true when working with AutoCAD.

Understanding Drawing Scale
105
Scaling in AutoCAD
You already know that in AutoCAD, you draw things full size, so that’s how
you’ve drawn your 45 × 70-meter floor plan. You’re also given an A1 sheet on
which to produce your drawing.
In AutoCAD, you have two ways to produce your drawing, which (you have
calculated) needs to end up at a scale of 1:20 on the paper drawing:
✦Plot from model space: When plotting from model space, you tell the PLOT
command to output the drawing at a scale of 1:20. Most of the time you’ll be
plotting from a layout, so don’t worry too much about this method.
✦Plot from a layout: A layout represents a blank, physical sheet of paper
on which you lay out your drawing sheet. The floor plane is still drawing
on the Model tab, but outputting the drawing to paper is done from a
layout tab. On a layout tab you create a viewport — in effect, a hole in
the drawing sheet through which you can view your floor plan in model
space. You apply a scale of 1:20 to the viewport. You then tell the PLOT
command to plot the drawing at 1:1.
Is your head hurting? I have just tossed a bunch of terms at you that you
may not have come across before: model space, layout, and viewport. Don’t
worry — I cover the differences between model space and layouts (paper
space) in the next section of this chapter. All I wanted to get across here is
the different methods of scaling between manual and AutoCAD drafting.
Scale factors
What both systems — manual drafting and CAD — have in common is scale
factor. Whichever method you use to end up with a 1:20 scale plotted draw-
ing, a scale factor is involved. Now, prepare for your head to hurt again,
because I’m going to do some math. To calculate the scale factor of any
given scale, you take the inverse of the scale ratio itself.
Okay, this calls for some examples. The metric system is about as simple as
it gets, because a drawing with a scale of 1:20 has a scale factor of 20. A scale
of 1:50 has a scale factor of 50, and 1:100 has a scale factor of 100.
It gets a little more complicated with Imperial scales, because you’re typi-
cally dealing with scales such as 1/4"=1'-0" or 1"=20'. You’ll notice that these
scales have units, and here’s what really messes things up: They have differ-
ent units on each side of the equal sign. Before you can calculate the scale
factor, you have to find the scale’s ratio, and for that, you need to make both
sides of the equation have the same units.
As an example, take the drawing scale 1/8"=1'-0". To find the ratio, first con-
vert both sides of the equation to the same units; you arrive at 1/8"=12".

Understanding Drawing Scale
106
Next, multiply both sides of the equation so that you’re dealing with whole
numbers; in this case, multiplying both sides by 8 gives you 1"=96". The
scale can also be expressed as 1:96, and so the scale factor is 96. (The metric
system is a lot easier, isn’t it?)
Table 6-2 lists some common scales and their corresponding scale factors
(the math has already been done for you).

Using scale factors to establish drawing settings
You use the drawing scale factors that you’ve just worked out to establish a
number of drawing settings. These include
✦Drawing limits: Multiply the scale factor by the dimensions of your plot
sheet to arrive at the limits. For example, if you’re going to print your
drawing on a D-size sheet (36 × 24 inches) at a scale of 1/4"=1'-0", multiply

Book I
Chapter VI

Drawings

107
both sheet dimensions by the scale factor of 48. This gives you an area of
1728 inches by 1152 inches, so you would set the upper-right corner of
the limits to 1728,1152 (or 144",96").
✦Dimension scale: All dimension sizes and spaces are set to their actual
plotted size. Text, for example, may be 2.5mm high. But 2.5mm text
would be invisible next to a wall that is 70 meters long. If you’re dimen-
sioning in model space, you set the dimension scale factor equivalent to
the drawing scale factor. I cover dimensions in Book III, Chapter 2.
✦Text height: Some drawing text goes in model space — and once again,
text that’s specified as 1/8" high will be a speck beside a 200' wall.
Multiply the desired text height times the drawing scale factor to arrive
at a model space text height that won’t be a speck; in this case, you mul-
tiply 1/8" times the drawing scale factor of 48, and tell AutoCAD to make
your text 6" high. I cover text in Book III, Chapter 1.
✦Hatch pattern scale and linetype scale: Drawing scale affects the appear-
ance of the dash lengths and gaps for hatch patterns and linetypes. I cover
hatch patterns in Book III, Chapter 3, and linetypes later in this chapter.
✦Viewport scale: You use drawing scales to affect the size of objects in a
viewport located on a layout. I cover viewports in Book VII, Chapter 1.
Lost in Space: Model or Paper?
It’s possible to print your drawing from the Model tab, but it’s much more
convenient to print from a layout. To do so, you must understand some of
the differences between model space and paper space, where layouts live.
✦Model space: This is the drawing environment that corresponds to 
the Model tab. Model space can represent an infinitely large, three-
dimensional area in which you create “real” objects. These objects are
referred to as the model, whether they’re 2D or 3D. Every drawing entity
that represents a real object is created in model space. Because only 
one model space exists, AutoCAD provides only one Model tab. On the
Model tab, you can see only objects in model space.
✦Paper space: This is the drawing environment that corresponds to the
Layout tabs. Paper space is also referred to as paper space layout or as
layout space. Although model space represents the real 1:1 space where
you create your models, paper space represents the 2D drawing sheet
that you create to document them. Any objects you add to your model
to document it — for example, title block, notes, dimensions, and sec-
tion marks — can generally be found on a paper space layout. (Notable
exceptions are center lines and hatching.) Because you may want to
create more than one drawing sheet from a model, you can have an infi-
nite number of layouts in a drawing file.

A Layered Approach
108
✦Layout: This is the tabbed environment where you create plottable draw-
ing sheets. The layout represents what will be plotted to paper. In addi-
tion to title blocks, notes, and dimensions, layouts include viewports —
windows cut through the paper so you can see the model. A layout can
contain a single viewport, or several viewports that examine different
areas of the model at the same or different scales. On the layout tabs, you
can see objects in model space and paper space, but you can select
objects only in one space or the other — never both at the same time.
Every AutoCAD drawing must have a Model tab and at least one layout tab.
Create the objects that represent the real object on the Model tab. Then create
layout tabs and viewports as needed to output your model. For more 
on layouts and viewports, see Book VII.
A Layered Approach
Layers are your principal tool for controlling information in an AutoCAD
drawing. Layers are like transparent overlays in manual drafting, where you
assemble different combinations of overlays to present different types of
information.
On an architectural drawing, for example, one drawing can contain the walls,
furniture layout, and ceiling grid with light fixtures and diffusers, as shown in
Figure 6-2. If each type of information is on its own layer, you can generate a
floor plan drawing by turning on the walls and furniture layers, and turning
off the ceiling layer. Then you can turn off the furniture layer and turn on the
ceiling layer to generate a new drawing, a reflected ceiling plan.
Layers are used also to segregate different drawing components. For exam-
ple, dimensions usually go on their own layer, as does text, the drawing
border, and any title-block information.

Layers must be created before they can be used. AutoCAD creates layer
names automatically as you add layers, but it gives them names like Layer 1,
Layer 2, Layer 3, and so on. It’s a good idea to give your layers sensible
names as you create them. Layer names can be up to 255 characters long
(which is pretty impractical!).
One process for setting up and using layers in a drawing follows:
1. Create the layers you need.
2. Assign color and linetype properties as required.
3. Set the desired layer current.
4. Draw stuff.
Anything you draw from this point on will be placed on the layer you made
current, until such time as you make another layer current.
All AutoCAD drawings contain a layer named 0, which can’t be renamed or
deleted. I recommend that you do not actually draw anything on Layer 0;
instead, you should create layers specifically for the objects that you add to
a drawing. Layer 0 has special properties when you create blocks, which I go
into in Book VI. Another special layer is named DEFPOINTS; this layer is cre-
ated the first time you add a dimension to a drawing and, like Layer 0, can’t
be deleted. I explain dimensions in Book III.
The Layer Properties Manager dialog box has been replaced with a modeless
version (a palette) in AutoCAD 2009. You can now create and control the visi-
bility and properties of layers in real time with the use of the new Layer
Properties Manager palette.
Creating layers
The following steps explain how to use the Layer Properties Manager palette
to create layers in any drawing file.
1. On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Layers panel➪Layer Properties.
AutoCAD displays the Layer Properties Manager palette (see Figure 6-3).
2. Click the New Layer button to add a new layer definition.
AutoCAD adds a new layer named Layer 1 to the layer list. The layer
name is highlighted, so you can type a new name to replace AutoCAD’s
generic label.

A Layered Approach
110
3. Type a new layer name (for example, Wall), and press Enter.
Give your layers sensible names. If you’re doing simple floor plans, it’s
enough to have layers named Wall, Door, Window, Appliance, and so on.
Whatever you do, don’t accept the default values of Layer 1, Layer 2, and
so on, or you’ll have no idea which objects are on which layer!
4. Continue adding layer names as required.
If you keep pressing Enter, you can keep adding (and renaming!) new layers.
5. Click the Set Current button to make a layer the current layer.
Only one layer at a time can be current, and anything you draw is cre-
ated on the current layer.
If you select a layer in the layer list before clicking the New Layer button,
the new layer created will be based on the selected layer. So the new layer
will share the same color, linetype, lineweight, plot style, plottable state,
and all other properties and states. This makes it easier to create multiple
layers that are almost the same with the exception of a few properties.
Defining layer properties
After you create layers, you can assign various states and properties to
them. Setting layer properties ensures that objects drawn on a given layer
take on the proper color, linetype, lineweight, and plot style.
Unless you have a really good reason to avoid doing so, use layers to control
the appearance of objects. It’s possible to set the color and other properties
of individual objects, but it’s usually a bad idea unless you know what you’re
doing and have a good reason. Applying explicit colors and other properties
to objects can make them difficult to edit when the need arises because you
can’t tell which layer objects are located on.

111
Layer properties include
✦Color: When a color is assigned to a layer, objects drawn on that layer
take on that color. Set layer color by accessing the Select Color dialog
box through the Layer Properties Manager palette. Color also controls
the plot style assigned to a layer when a drawing uses color-dependent
plot styles. I cover plot styles in Book VII.
✦Linetype: Most AutoCAD objects have the default linetype, which is a
solid, continuous line. However, some drafting conventions require the
use of noncontinuous linetypes (sometimes called dash-dot linetypes),
such as center lines and hidden lines. You can assign a linetype to a layer
by using the Select Linetype dialog box through the Layer Properties
Manager palette. I cover linetypes later in this chapter.
✦Lineweight: Lineweight refers to the visible width of lines in the drawing
window. When drawings are plotted correctly, the output shows different
line thicknesses — thin lines for dimensions, thick lines for borders,
medium lines for object lines and text, and so on. But when displayed in
the drawing window, objects usually appear with a single-line thickness.
You can assign a lineweight to a layer by using the Lineweight dialog box
through the Layer Properties Manager palette.
✦Plot style: If your drawing is configured to use named plot styles, you
can assign an already existing plot style to a layer. If your drawing is set
up to use color-dependent plot styles, the Plot Style column in the Layer
Properties Manager palette is dimmed; the only way to change a plot style
here is to change the layer color. Plot styles are not something you need
to be concerned with at this moment; I cover them in detail in Book VII.
✦Description: This is text that explains what a layer might be used for.
Although it’s an optional property for a layer, it can help when sharing
drawings with contractors or clients because it helps them understand
the general purpose of a layer in a drawing.
Viewports offer additional control over layer properties. When a viewport on
a layout tab is active, you can override a layer’s color, linetype, lineweight,
or plot style. Layer overrides are specific to only that viewport. So you can
have a single layer with multiple property values in a drawing if layer over-
rides are applied to different viewports. I cover applying layer overrides to
viewports in Book VII.
You can also access the Select Color, Select Linetype, and Lineweight dialog
boxes by entering the appropriate command names at the command prompt
or by choosing Color, Linetype, or Lineweight from the Format menu on the
menu browser or menu bar. But doing those things does not set a layer
property — it does something potentially more damaging. It sets the default
color, linetype, or lineweight that will be used when you create new objects,
regardless of the current layer and its settings, from that point forward.

A Layered Approach
112
When objects are allowed to take on the properties of the layers on which
they are drawn, those properties are said to be By Layer.
Setting layer modes
In addition to layer properties, which have a wide range of possible settings,
you can choose from a series of layer modes, which are toggles with only
two possible settings (see Figure 6-4).
The five layer modes are
✦On/Off: Objects on the layer are visible if the mode is on (the light bulb is
switched on) and invisible if the mode is off (the light bulb is switched off).
Strangely enough, the current layer can be turned off; it’s even possible
to draw on a layer that’s turned off, as long as it’s current. So if you start
drawing lines that don’t appear in the drawing window, check to make
sure that the layer is not turned off or frozen.
✦Freeze/Thaw: Objects are visible if the layer is thawed or invisible if the
layer is frozen. The difference between Off and Frozen is that frozen layers
are not included when AutoCAD regenerates the objects in the current
drawing. A glowing sun indicates a thawed layer, and a snowflake means
a layer is frozen. You can’t set a frozen layer as current.
If you frequently need to use a layer but want to hide the objects when
they are not needed on the screen, turn off the layer instead of freezing it.
When you turn the layer back on, AutoCAD doesn’t need to regenerate
the objects in the current drawing. Also, objects on a frozen layer can’t
be selected when you use the All option at the Select objects prompt. I
cover regenerating a drawing in Book II, Chapter 3; I cover the All option
for selecting objects in Book II, Chapter 2.

113
✦Lock/Unlock: When a layer is locked, you can see the objects on the
layer, you can select the objects, and you can even draw on the layer.
But you can’t edit objects on a locked layer. A padlock icon in Layer
Properties Manager or the Layer list indicates whether a layer is locked.
You can identify if a layer is locked in the drawing window by the pres-
ence of a padlock icon next to the crosshairs when the crosshairs are
hovering over an object on a locked layer.
To make it easier to identify which layers are locked and unlocked, you
can fade locked layers into the background. To turn on locked layer
fading, expand the Layers panel (by clicking its title area) on the Home
tab of the ribbon. Then click the Locked Layer Fading toggle and adjust
the percentage by which you want the layers to appear faded. A value of
0 percent means objects on a locked layer are not faded; a value greater
than 0, up to 90 percent, indicates the amount the objects on the locked
layer are faded into the background.
✦Plot/NoPlot: You can set this layer mode so that objects on the selected
layer are visible but will not appear on a plot or print preview.
✦Freeze/Thaw in New Viewports: Controls which layers are frozen or
thawed for each new viewport that is created on a layout tab. I discuss
this option in greater detail in Book VII.
Another mode is available when a viewport is active on a layout tab. When 
a viewport is active, you can freeze a layer or set of layers specific to that
viewport. I cover this additional option in Book VII.
Modifying layer settings
You can access the Layer Properties Manager palette at any time by clicking
the Home tab on the ribbon and then clicking Layers panel➪Layer Properties,
or by typing LA at the command prompt and pressing Enter. You don’t have
to create all your layers when you start a new drawing; you can add (or remove)
layers at any time in the drawing’s life.
Nonetheless, the most efficient way of setting up and managing layers in any
drawing is to create them all at once and make the appropriate property and
layer stats while you’re creating them.
Setting layer color
The following steps explain how to modify layer properties and settings in
the Layer Properties Manager palette:
1. Open the Layer Properties Manager palette if it’s not already open.
On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Layers panel➪Layer Properties.

A Layered Approach
114
2. Select the layer whose color you want to change.
To select multiple layers, hold down the Ctrl key to select multiple
layers at a time, or hold down the Shift key to select a range of layers.
3. Click the color swatch in the Color column for the selected layer.
AutoCAD displays the Select Color dialog box (see Figure 6-5).
4. With the Index Color tab current, select one of the large color
swatches near the bottom left of the dialog box, and then click OK to
close the dialog box.
The foreground color of the sample rectangles in the lower-right corner
of the dialog box changes to the selected color. AutoCAD closes the Select
Color dialog box and returns to the Layer Properties Manager palette. The
layer shows the new color and name under the Color column.
For more information on using colors in AutoCAD, see the “Using AutoCAD’s
color systems” section later in the chapter.
Setting linetype
There’s a wrinkle to setting linetypes in an AutoCAD drawing. Unlike colors,
which are always available, noncontinuous linetypes are defined in an exter-
nal file that goes by one of these file names:
✦acad.lin: The default linetype definition file, designed for use with
Imperial units and based on inches.
✦acadiso.lin: The default linetype definition file designed for use with
metric units and based on millimeters.
Figure 6-5:

✦acadlt.lin: The AutoCAD LT version of acad.lin. (Prior to AutoCAD 2007,
this file was named aclt.lin.)
✦acadltiso.lin: The AutoCAD LT version of acadiso.lin. (Prior to 
AutoCAD 2007, this file was named acltiso.lin.)
For an explanation of the different linetype definitions, see the “Using line-
types” section later in the chapter.
You can load linetypes as a separate step, before you create your layers, by
clicking Format➪Linetype from the menu browser or menu bar to display
the Linetype Manager dialog box. Alternatively, you can follow these steps to
access Linetype Manager from the Layer Properties Manager palette:
1. If the Layer Properties Manager palette is not already open, open it.
On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Layers panel➪Layer Properties.
AutoCAD displays Layer Properties Manager.
2. Select the layer whose linetype you want to change.
3. In the Linetype column, click the name of the current linetype (by
default Continuous).
AutoCAD displays the Select Linetype dialog box. By default, only the
Continuous linetype is loaded.
4. Click Load to display the Load or Reload Linetypes dialog box.
Load or Reload Linetypes displays all linetypes defined in the current
linetype definition file (see Figure 6-6).
Figure 6-6:
Linetypes
galore.

A Layered Approach
116
5. Scroll through the list and select the linetypes to load, and then click OK.
Hold the Ctrl key to select more than one linetype or hold down the Shift
key to select a range of linetypes to load. The Load or Reload Linetypes
dialog box closes, and the focus returns to the Select Linetype dialog box.
6. Select the linetype you want to assign to the selected layer in the
Layer Properties Manager palette, and then click OK.
The Select Linetype dialog box closes, and the selected linetype is
assigned to the layer (see Figure 6-7).
Setting lineweight
Lineweights are like colors — they’re always present and available, unlike
linetypes which have to be loaded into the drawing before they can be assigned.
Lineweight is a display property that shows a representation of the relative
thickness of different drawing objects. Lineweight works differently in model
space and paper space:
✦In model space, lineweight is based on a number of pixels, so that no
matter how close you zoom in — or how far you zoom out — linework
always appears to have the same visual thickness.
✦In paper space, lineweight is part of the representation of the paper
drawing. If you put linework on a paper drawing under a magnifying
glass, the lines appear thicker, and that’s exactly how it works in paper
space — as you zoom in, the lines appear thicker.
The following steps explain how to assign a lineweight to a layer:
1. If the Layer Properties Manager palette is not already open, open it.
On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Layers panel➪Layer Properties.
2. Select the layer whose lineweight you want to change.
Figure 6-7:

117
3. In the Lineweight column, click the word Default.
AutoCAD displays the Lineweight dialog box (see Figure 6-8).
4. Scroll down the list to find the desired lineweight.
Because plotter pens were traditionally sized in millimeters, AutoCAD’s
lineweights are also displayed in millimeters whether metric or Imperial
units are configured.
5. Select the lineweight you want to assign to the selected layer in the
Layer Properties Manager palette, and then click OK.
The Lineweight dialog box closes and focus returns to the Layer
Properties Manager palette.
Assigning lineweights to layers is only half the story. You also need to click
the Show/Hide Lineweights (or LWT) button on the status bar to display
lineweights in the drawing window. When the button is selected, lineweight
display is enabled; when the button is not selected, all geometry appears in
the default line width, which is 1 pixel in size.
The lineweight property can be applied to the output of a drawing that is
generated when plotting, as well as to the visual representation of drawing
objects. I tell you more about that in Book VII.
Setting layer modes
As already noted, the layer modes are toggles that let you control the follow-
ing: layer visibility, the layers that are recalculated when AutoCAD regener-
ates a drawing, whether the objects on a visible layer can be edited, whether
the objects on a visible layer are plotted, and whether a layer is frozen by
default when a new viewport is created on a layout.
Figure 6-8:

The following procedure runs through the five layer modes in the Layer
Properties Manager palette:
1. If the Layer Properties Manager palette is not already open, open it.
On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Layers panel➪Layer Properties.
2. Select a layer whose modes you want to modify.
3. To toggle a layer’s visibility on or off, click the light bulb icon in the
On column.
4. To freeze a layer so that it’s not recalculated when the display is
regenerated, click the sun icon in the Freeze column. To thaw a layer,
click the snowflake icon.
5. To lock or unlock a layer to prevent or allow the objects on the layer
to be edited, click the padlock icon in the Lock column.
6. To prevent or allow objects on a layer to be printed, click the Printer
icon in the Plot column.
7. To freeze a layer in new viewports created on layouts, click the sun
icon in the New VP Freeze column. To have the layer thawed in new
viewports, click the snowflake icon.
I discuss this option in greater detail in Book VII.
The Layer Control drop-down list
You use the Layer Properties Manager palette to modify layer properties,
including color, linetype, lineweight, and plot style. You can also turn layer
modes off and on in the Layer Properties Manager palette, but if the latter is all
you need to do, there’s a more efficient way than opening and closing a palette.
The Layers panel contains a drop-down list of all the layers in a drawing (see
Figure 6-9).
Figure 6-9:

You can click the down arrow (or inside the list box) to expand the list, and
then perform any of the following actions:
✦Set a layer current by clicking the layer name.
✦Turn layer visibility off or on by clicking the light bulb.
✦Freeze or thaw a layer by clicking the sun or snowflake.
You can’t freeze the current layer.
✦Lock or unlock a layer by clicking the padlock.
✦Freeze or thaw a layer for new viewports by clicking the sun or snowflake
over a rectangle. I discuss this mode in greater detail in Book VII.
After you change the mode, click anywhere outside the Layer Control list to
close the list and return focus to the drawing.
Because the Layer Control drop-down list shows a color tile for each layer,
you might think you can click it to change a layer’s color, but you’re wrong.
Color is a property, and properties can be changed only in the Layer
Properties Manager palette.
Layer tools
AutoCAD provides a wide variety of tools that allow you to select an object
and display only the objects on that layer or freeze a layer just by selecting
an object in the drawing. These additional tools can be found on the Layers
panel of the Home tab on the ribbon. The commands that start each layer tool
are listed in the parentheses next to the tool name.
✦Layer States Manager (LAYERSTATE): Layer States Manager allows you
to save and restore layer states. This tool allows you to create a snap-
shot of the layers in a drawing that you receive from a client, and then
restore the layers to the way they were when you received the drawing
before sending it back to the client.
✦Make Object’s Layer Current (LAYMCUR): Make Object’s Layer Current
allows you to select an object in the drawing window and set the
object’s layer as the current layer.
✦Layer Walk (LAYWALK): Layer Walk allows you to dynamically step
through all the layers in a drawing to see the objects placed on those
layers, without forcing you to freeze or thaw or turn layers off and on.
✦Layer Match (LAYMCH): Layer Match allows you to select objects in the
drawing that should be moved to a different layer based on the layer a
selected object is already on.

Object Properties
120
✦Change to Current Layer (LAYCUR): Change to Current Layer allows
you to select an object in a drawing and set the selected object to the
current layer.
✦Copy Objects to New Layer (COPYTOLAYER): Copy Objects to New Layer
allows you to move selected objects to another layer or a new layer.
✦Layer Isolate (LAYISO): Layer Isolate allows you to turn off all layers
except the ones selected.
✦Isolate Layer to Current Viewport (LAYVPI): Isolate Layer to Current
Viewport freezes the layer in all viewports except the active viewport.
✦Layer Unisolate (LAYUNISO): Layer Unisolate restores the layers that
were hidden or locked with the Layer Isolate tool.
✦Layer Off (LAYOFF): Layer Off allows you to turn off a layer by selecting
an object that is on that layer.
✦Turn All Layers On (LAYON): Turn All Layers On turns on all layers that
are currently marked as off.
✦Layer Freeze (LAYFRZ): Layer Freeze allows you to freeze a layer by
selecting an object that is on that layer.
✦Thaw All Layers (LAYTHW): Thaw All Layers thaws layers that are cur-
rently marked as frozen.
✦Layer Lock (LAYLCK): Layer Lock allows you to lock a layer by selecting
an object on that layer.
✦Layer Unlock (LAYULK): Layer Unlock allows you to unlock a layer by
selecting an object on that layer.
✦Layer Merge (LAYMRG): Layer Merge allows you to move all the objects
on one layer to another layer.
✦Layer Delete (LAYDEL): Layer Delete allows you to delete all the objects
on a layer and then purge the layer from the drawing.
Object Properties
In AutoCAD, all objects have properties. Every object in a drawing is created
on a layer. Layers can have a number of properties assigned to them, and
anything drawn on a specific layer takes on the color, linetype, lineweight
and other “by layer” properties of that layer.

In addition to the properties that an object inherits from its layer, an object
can have the following properties:
✦Color
✦Linetype
✦Lineweight
✦Plot style
Layers in AutoCAD, but not AutoCAD LT, have an additional property that is
not managed through the Layer Properties Manager palette. A material name
can be attached to a layer by using the Material Attachment Options dialog
box (MATERIALATTACH command). I cover materials in Book V, Chapter 6.
Object properties can be assigned directly (or explicitly) to objects, or they
can be assigned to layers. For example, on a floor plan you might have a
bunch of blue doors. The color blue may have been assigned to each individ-
ual door, in which case the color will be listed as Blue. Or the color blue may
have been assigned to the layer on which the doors were drawn, in which
case the color is listed as BYLAYER.
Is one method better than the other? I certainly think so. For example, you
may draw a floor plan in which you want all the doors to be blue. Then you
decide they should be green instead. If you changed the doors explicitly, 
you would have to go through the drawing and select each and every door,
and then open the Properties palette and change their color to green.
Alternatively, you can just open the Layer Properties Manager palette and
change the color of the Door layer from blue to green. Obviously, one of
these processes is easier than the other.
When objects do not have explicit colors or other properties set, they take
on the properties of the layer they are placed on.
I strongly advise you not to change the properties of objects in a drawing,
but instead to leave their color, linetype, lineweight, and other properties set
to BYLAYER. Applying explicit changes to objects can make them difficult to
edit because you can’t tell on which layer the objects are located.

Using AutoCAD’s color systems
In AutoCAD drafting, color has two main functions, neither of which is pro-
ducing color drawings:
✦Color helps you differentiate objects from one another in the drawing
window. When you assign colors to layers, you can tell immediately if some-
thing is on the wrong layer if it doesn’t show up in the color you expect.
✦Using the traditional color-dependent plotting system, the colors of
objects determine the thickness of the plotted linework.
Since AutoCAD 2004, you can use three color systems:
✦ACI Color Index: The original and genuine 255 colors that have always
been part of AutoCAD (refer to Figure 6-5).
✦True Color: A range of over 16 million colors you can set by dragging
sliders or entering RGB (Red Green Blue) or HSL (Hue Saturation
Luminance) values.
✦Color Books: A set of predefined color palettes that are often used in
graphic arts and desktop publishing. You can choose colors from the
DIC, Pantone, and RAL color systems.
You use True Color or Color Books colors to try and match a specific mate-
rial color if you’re creating materials for rendering in AutoCAD only. For
most drafting purposes, the 255 standard colors on the ACI Color Index tab
are adequate.
Usually AutoCAD gets a new feature or both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT get
the same feature, but in this release AutoCAD LT gets a feature that AutoCAD
has had since AutoCAD 2004. In AutoCAD LT 2009, you can now assign a True
Color or Color Books color to an object or layer. No longer is AutoCAD LT
limited to just having support for only the 255 ACI Color Index colors.
Using linetypes
The four linetype files (acad.lin and acadiso.lin, and their acadlt equivalents)
include 45 linetype definitions, broken down as follows:
✦24 AutoCAD standard linetypes: 8 basic patterns (border, center, 
dash-dot, dashed, divide, dot, hidden, and phantom) each in 3 spacing
variants; for example, BORDER has normal spacing of its dash and 
dot elements; BORDER2’s elements are half the size of BORDER’s; 
BORDERX2’s elements are twice the size of BORDER.

123
✦14 ISO 128 linetypes conforming to ISO/DIS 12011 specification: These
are rarely used; I recommend that you stick with the 24 standard line-
types, for Imperial or metric drafting.
✦7 complex linetypes: These include symbols or text as well as dash-dot
line patterns. Linetypes include fence lines, railroad tracks, and batt
insulation.
In addition to these 45 linetypes, the acadiso.lin and acadltiso.lin files
include an additional 14 JIS linetypes. Although the preceding linetypes will
work for either Imperial or metric drafting, the JIS linetypes are for metric
work only. And I still recommend using the 24 standard linetypes for most
drafting in metric or Imperial. If you find that the linetypes that come with
AutoCAD do not cover what you need to represent a linetype in a drawing,
you can create your own custom linetypes. I cover creating custom linetypes
in Book IX, Chapter 4.
Linetypes are loaded into a drawing by using the Select Linetypes dialog box
(from the menu browser or menu bar, click Format➪Linetypes). I cover load-
ing linetypes earlier in this chapter under the section “Setting linetype.”
Setting Up Standards
In this chapter, I discuss many of the settings you can use to enhance your
AutoCAD drawings. You may have observed that AutoCAD provides a
number of settings, and if you’re like me, the last thing you want to do is go
through setting up layers each and every time you create a new drawing.
The good news is, you don’t have to!
In Chapter 3 of this minibook, I discuss the various file types available in
AutoCAD, and explain how to create a drawing by using a drawing template
(DWT) file. I point out that the default drawing templates are fine, but that
you probably want to add settings (and maybe even objects) to make them
really useful.
Everything that I discuss in this chapter — from layers to linetypes to text and
dimension styles — can be created and saved in a drawing template so that
they’re available to you in every drawing you start from that drawing template.
After going through this chapter, you know that you can add quite a few settings
to a drawing template to save yourself a great deal of effort for future drawings.
In the chapters ahead, I look at annotation, inserting blocks, and other features
that will enhance the usability of your drawing templates as well.

T
he purpose of creating technical drawings, or drafting, is to convey
enough information to a builder or fabricator so that he or she can con-
struct or manufacture whatever it is that you’ve just technically drawn . . .
er, drafted.
Manual drawings are as precise as the drafter can make them, which means
as precise as a mechanical pencil dragged against a parallel rule or drafting
machine. They’re good enough to get the job done because the dimensions
are going to confirm sizes and notes.
Dimensioning can be a major job in manual drafting, and luckily, you have
an extra tool at your disposal with AutoCAD: You can add dimensions by
clicking objects or selecting points. AutoCAD extracts the dimension value
and adds the correct text to the dimension. Now, if you are precise in your
drafting, the dimension values will be perfect, but if you are sloppy . . . 
you may be hearing from the builder that you’ve asked to locate a wall 
12'–6 29/256" from the corner!
This chapter tells you how to make use of AutoCAD’s built-in drafting aids to
create accurate and precise drawings.
Understanding Accuracy and Precision
You probably hear a lot of sloppy word usage in the technical-drawing field.
One of the most common offenses is the idea that accuracy and precision
mean the same thing. They’re different, and here’s how:

Understanding Coordinate Systems
126
✦Precision means the degree of fineness of measurement. AutoCAD is
capable of extremely high levels of precision — and can create drawings
much more precisely than, say, a building or a highway could ever be
constructed.
✦Accuracy refers to the relationship between what is being drafted and
reality. You can create the most precise drawings of which AutoCAD is
capable, but if the surveyor got the field measurements wrong, or you
read the field notes incorrectly, your drawing is not going to be accurate
to reality.
Although accuracy is important, precision is the order of the day when you
work with AutoCAD. Here’s the skinny on AutoCAD’s drafting aids:
✦Coordinate input: Create drawing objects by specifying the x-, y-, and 
z-coordinates that locate them in 2D (or 3D) space.
✦Direct distance entry: Locate new points relative to a point you’ve just
entered by dragging the mouse pointer to show direction and then
entering a value for the distance.
✦Grid and snap: Drafting modes you can toggle on and off; grid is a
purely visual aid, but snap is a precision input method.
✦Ortho and polar: Additional drafting modes that can be toggled on/off;
when turned on, ortho mode forces the crosshairs to move horizontally or
vertically only, and polar tracking guides the crosshairs along preset angles.
✦Object snaps: Locate points that fall at precise locations on an object
(such as endpoints and midpoints of lines, or centers and quadrant
points of circles).
✦Object snap tracking: Use object snap points on existing objects to
locate a new point in a drawing that does not fall on an existing object.
Through a combination of these drafting aids, you can create drawings far
more precise than the most skillful manually drafted drawing. And what
you’ll quickly find as you gain experience is that drawing precisely is easier
than drawing sloppily.
Understanding Coordinate Systems
In an AutoCAD drawing, everything is located in 2D (or 3D) space by a set of
Cartesian, or x,y (-z), coordinates. Cartesian coordinates are named after the
French philosopher Rene Descartes, who’s probably better known for his
saying, “I think, therefore I am.”
Descartes believed that you could tease out the meaning of anything through
a system of reasoning modeled on the certainty of mathematics. One of the
side benefits of his mathematical thinking (arguably a more useful one than

Book I
Chapter 7
Precision Tools
Understanding Coordinate Systems
127
the system of reasoning) was the coordinate system named after him. Described
simply, everything in 3D space can be located from a predefined origin by
counting the number of units in each of the three directions between the 
object and the origin.
The 2D coordinate system — for the time being, I’ll stick with 2D to keep
things simple — is defined by a horizontal axis and a vertical axis. By conven-
tion, the horizontal axis is called the x axis, and the vertical axis is called the
y axis. The x axis and y axis intersect at the origin of the coordinate system.
The two axes define a plane called, naturally enough, the xy plane. The coor-
dinates of any point are its distances from the origin along the x axis and the
y axis, and the coordinates are expressed in the form x,y. For example, the
coordinate pair 5,4 would indicate a point lying 5 units to the right of the
origin along the x axis, and 4 units above the origin along the y axis.
The 3D coordinate system adds a third axis, the z axis (which is pronounced
zed-axis outside the United States). The z axis also passes through the origin,
and is perpendicular to the xy plane. I’ve more to say about the z axis in
Book V.
The x and y axes divide the xy plane into four quadrants. Points located in
the two quadrants to the right of the y axis have positive x coordinates;
points to the left of the y axis have negative x coordinates. Points located in
the two quadrants above the x axis have positive y coordinates, and points
in the quadrants below the x axis have negative y coordinates. Figure 7-1
illustrates the 2D coordinate system.
Figure 7-1:
The
Cartesian
coordinate
system.

Understanding Coordinate Systems
128
To keep coordinates simple, most drawings are created in the upper-right
quadrant. This locates the origin (0,0) at the lower-left corner of the drawing
area so that all coordinate values can be positive numbers. The lower-left
corner of the limits of a drawing usually starts at the origin, and is why the
default lower-left corner is set to 0,0.
The world coordinate system
Everything you draw in AutoCAD is created in an infinitely large drawing
space, and can be located by x and y coordinates. The default coordinate
system in AutoCAD is called the world coordinate system, or WCS. Many
AutoCAD users spend their whole careers drafting in the WCS. Unless you’re
working in 3D, there’s little reason to change the WCS to a user coordinate
system (or UCS), but it can be done if necessary. For more on working in 3D
and the user coordinate system, see Book V.
The icon in the lower-left corner of the drawing area in Figure 7-1 is the UCS
icon, and it’s a handy device for recovering your bearings if you ever lose
them. Figure 7-2 shows several variations in the icon’s appearance. The box
at the intersection of the two arrows means you’re in the WCS.
If the UCS icon is set to display at the origin, it will move around the drawing
area as the view of the drawing is panned and zoomed. If the icon is set to
display off the origin, it will always appear at the lower-left corner of the
drawing area.
By default AutoCAD displays the UCS icon at the origin. This can be distract-
ing if you’re only working in the WCS. The following steps explain how to
control the UCS icon’s display:
WCS, icon
located at orgin
UCS, icon

The display of the UCS icon is toggled on and off based on its current state.
2. On the ribbon, click View tab➪UCS panel➪Origin.
3. Specify a new point to move the UCS icon to 0,0,0 in the drawing, or to
the lower-left corner of the drawing area.
You can control the appearance and size of the UCS icon by using the UCS
Icon dialog box. (On the menu browser or menu bar, click View menu➪
Display➪UCS Icon➪Properties). If you are the nostalgic type, you can even
make the UCS icon look the way it did in AutoCAD 2000 and earlier releases.
The display and position of the UCS icon is saved in the drawing. If you
create a drawing template, you can set the UCS icon to display off the origin.
Each drawing created with the drawing template will display the UCS icon in
the position specified in the drawing template.
Entering coordinates
The standard way of feeding coordinates to AutoCAD is by typing them at
the command prompt and pressing Enter. Five types of coordinate entries
are commonly used in AutoCAD:
✦Absolute x,y coordinates
✦Relative x,y coordinates
✦Relative polar coordinates
✦Spherical coordinates
✦Cylindrical coordinates
The first three types work in both 2D drafting and 3D modeling. The last two —
spherical and cylindrical coordinates — are alternative ways of entering 3D
coordinates and work in 3D only. These two coordinate-input methods are
covered in Book V.
Entering absolute x,y coordinates
You enter absolute coordinates as pairs of numbers separated by a comma, like
this: x,y. No spaces, just the comma (this is AutoCAD, not English punctuation!).
The x value is always expressed first, and then the y value is represented. If you
see a third value — for example, x,y,z — the z coordinate is representing 
a 3D point.

To draw a square by using absolute x,y coordinates from the command line,
follow these steps:
1. On the status bar, click Dynamic Input (DYN) to disable dynamic input.

You might use absolute coordinates if you’re working on a site plan, and the
surveyor has supplied you with coordinates of parcel corners. Drawing this
way satisfies the need for precision, but you’d have to do a lot of calculating
to figure out the absolute coordinates of every point in the drawing. It’s
much handier to use relative coordinates, which I cover next.
Entering relative x,y coordinates
Where absolute coordinates are always based on the origin of the drawing
(that is, 0,0), relative coordinates are based on the last point entered. Input
of the coordinates themselves is the same as for absolute x,y coordinates,
but you tell AutoCAD that the location you’re entering is based on the last
point by typing an @ symbol before the coordinates — for example, entering
@5,4 makes a new point 5 units to the right and 4 units above the last point,
not the origin.
To draw a square by using relative x,y coordinates from the command line,
follow these steps:
1. On the status bar, click Dynamic Input (DYN) to disable dynamic input.
The Dynamic Input (DYN) button is no longer highlighted or pushed in.
2. On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Draw panel➪Line.

4. Type @5,0 and press Enter.
The command displays the prompt
Specify next point or [Undo]:
The @ symbol tells AutoCAD that the next point is relative to the point
you just entered rather than the origin. From this point, AutoCAD draws
a line 5 units in the x direction and 0 units in the y direction.
5. Type @0,5 and press Enter, and then type @-5,0 and press Enter, and
then type C and press Enter.
Create vertical or horizontal lines by specifying 0 as the relative y or x
coordinate. Draw lines to the left of or below the last point by specifying
negative coordinate values.
The command line appears as follows:
Specify next point or [Undo]: @0,5
Specify next point or [Close/Undo]: @-5,0

3. Type 5,5 and press Enter.
The command displays the prompt
Specify next point or [Undo]:
4. Type 5,0 and press Enter.
The command displays the prompt
Specify next point or [Undo]:
When using dynamic input, and its default behavior, you do not have to
enter the @ symbol because it automatically assumes that you want to
use relative coordinate values for the second or next points. If you enter
@5,0 for the coordinate value, dynamic input will still process the value
as relative.

5. Type 0,5 and press Enter, and then type -5,0 and press Enter, and then
type C and press Enter.
Create vertical or horizontal lines by specifying 0 as the relative y or x
coordinate. Draw lines to the left of or below the last point by specifying
negative coordinate values. Notice that even though you did not enter
the @ symbol, dynamic input added it for you when it sent the coordi-
nate value to the command line.
The command line appears as follows:
Specify next point or [Undo]: @0,5
Specify next point or [Close/Undo]: @-5,0
Specify next point or [Close/Undo]: C
In my experience, this is one of the least-used methods of coordinate input.
Luckily, you have another way of entering relative coordinates, one that
makes much more sense than either of the preceding two: relative polar
coordinates.
Entering relative polar coordinates
Relative polar coordinates are like relative x,y coordinates in that both use
the @ symbol to tell AutoCAD to draw a line from the last point, not from the
origin. They’re different from relative x,y coordinates in that the two values
are distance and angle, rather than offsets along the x and y axes. AutoCAD
knows that you’re entering polar coordinates because instead of a comma,
you type a left angle bracket (also known as the less than symbol). Luckily,
the left angle bracket is on the same key as the comma you use for x,y coor-
dinates; you just need to also remember to hold down the Shift key.
For example, entering @5,30 at a LINE command prompt tells AutoCAD to
draw a line segment 5 units in the x direction and 30 units in the y direction
from the last point. Entering @5<30 tells AutoCAD to draw a line 5 units in
length at an angle of 30 degrees. Obviously, the results are going to be very
different, so if you want polar, don’t forget to Shift!
To draw a square by using relative polar coordinates from the command line,
follow these steps:
1. On the status bar, click Dynamic Input (DYN) to disable dynamic input.
The Dynamic Input (DYN) button is disabled when it is not highlighted
or not pushed in.
2. On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Draw panel➪Line.
The LINE command starts and displays the prompt
Specify first point:

3. Type 9,9 and press Enter.
The command displays the prompt
Specify next point or [Undo]:
4. Type @7<0 and press Enter.
Remember, the @ symbol means relative to the last point. Type the dis-
tance, type — remember that Shift key! — the left angle bracket, type the
angle, and press Enter.
AutoCAD draws a line 7 units long, at an angle of 0 degrees.
Chapter 4 of this minibook explains that by convention in AutoCAD, 0
degrees lies in the direction of the positive x axis, and angles are measured
in a counterclockwise direction.
The command displays the prompt
Specify next point or [Undo]:
5. Type @7<90 and press Enter, and then type @7<180 and press Enter,
and then type C and press Enter.
With relative polar coordinates, you’re always entering positive values.
The command line appears as follows:
Specify next point or [Undo]: @7<90
Specify next point or [Close/Undo]: @7<180
Specify next point or [Close/Undo]: C
To draw a square by using relative polar coordinates with dynamic input,
follow these steps:
1. On the status bar, click Dynamic Input (DYN) to enable dynamic input.
The Dynamic Input (DYN) button is highlighted or pushed in.

3. Type 9,9 and press Enter.
The command displays the prompt
Specify next point or [Undo]:
4. Type 7<0 and press Enter.
Remember, you do not need to use the @ symbol when using the default
settings of dynamic input. Type the distance, the left angle bracket,
angle, and press Enter. If you enter @7<0 for the coordinate value,
dynamic input will still process the value as relative.

Most users find that relative polar coordinates are the most logical method
of coordinate entry for use with the second or next point when creating or
modifying objects in AutoCAD. You don’t need to calculate displacements in
the x and y directions; distances are actual distances.
So far so good, but AutoCAD has one more little trick up its sleeve that
makes polar coordinates even easier. Read on . . .
Direct distance entry
An elaboration (actually a simplified method) of relative polar coordinates is
called direct distance entry, or DDE. When you enter relative polar coordi-
nates, you specify distance and angle, typing no fewer than four keystrokes,
two of which also require that you hold down the Shift key.
When using DDE, you enter the distance only. You specify the angle by drag-
ging the crosshairs on the screen. Not much hunting and pecking, and no
holding down the Shift key.
“Waaaaait a minute,” you say. “How precise can dragging the crosshairs to
specify an angle be?” The answer, of course, is not very precise at all, if
you’re simply dragging the crosshairs without using the precision aids that
AutoCAD provides. Ortho mode and polar tracking (both discussed shortly)
help here: Ortho forces the crosshairs to move at angles of 0, 90, 180, and 270
degrees. Polar tracking is similar to ortho mode but is more flexible; you can
specify any angle you like. Also, it doesn’t force the crosshairs to follow
those preset angles; it jumps to a specified angle and displays a tooltip to
show your tracking (see Figure 7-3).

Understanding Coordinate Systems
136
To draw a square by using direct distance entry, follow these steps:
1. On the status bar, click Ortho Mode (ORTHO) to enable ortho mode.
Ortho mode forces any lines you draw to be horizontal or vertical. I dis-
cuss ortho mode later in this chapter.
2. On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Draw panel➪Line.
The line command starts and displays the prompt
Specify first point:
3. Type 15,15 and press Enter.
The command displays the prompt
Specify next point or [Undo]:
4. Drag the crosshairs to the right, and then type 9 and press Enter.
It doesn’t matter how far you drag the crosshairs — you’re providing
AutoCAD with an angle, not the distance. AutoCAD draws a horizontal
line to the right with a length of 9 units.
The command displays the prompt
Specify next point or [Undo]:
5. Drag the crosshairs upward, type 9, and press Enter. Then drag to the
left, type 9, and press Enter. Finally, type C and press Enter.
With relative polar coordinates, you always enter positive values. The
command line appears as follows:
Specify next point or [Undo]: @7<90
Specify next point or [Close/Undo]: @7<180
Specify next point or [Close/Undo]: C
When you can use it, DDE is a terrific keystroke saver.

Dynamic input and coordinate entry
I introduce dynamic input in Chapter 3 of this minibook. Dynamic input was
first introduced in AutoCAD 2006, and many have started to use it more and
more with each release. Dynamic input provides several enhancements over
entering coordinate values at the command line or using ortho mode and
polar tracking. By default, dynamic input uses relative coordinates automati-
cally when entering a second or next point, doing away with the need of the 
@ symbol.
If you turn off Dynamic Input (DYN) mode, AutoCAD still accepts input at the
command line or through picking points in the drawing window, but if you’re
using dynamic input, relative coordinates are specified by default. And if you
want to enter absolute coordinates by using dynamic input, you must use
the # symbol as the prefix.
Dynamic input also offers some of the flexibility found in ortho mode and
polar tracking through the use of dimension input tooltips that are displayed
when specifying coordinate points. The dimension input tooltips allow you
to lock the current input to a specific distance or angle or both. You control
the behavior of the coordinate input for the second or next point through
the use of dimension inputs on the Dynamic Input tab of the Drafting
Settings dialog box.
To change the settings for dynamic input, follow these steps:
1. On the status bar, right-click Dynamic Input (DYN) and choose
Settings.
AutoCAD displays the Drafting Settings dialog box with the Dynamic
Input tab current (see Figure 7-4).
2. In the Pointer Input area, click Settings.
AutoCAD displays the Pointer Input Settings dialog box (Figure 7-5).
3. In the Format area, select Relative Coordinates.
Selecting Relative Coordinates sets dynamic input to use relative coordi-
nate values unless the # symbol is entered for the second or next point;
this is the default option. When Relative Coordinates is set, you do not
need to enter @ to use a relative coordinate value. If absolute is chosen,
you must enter @ to use relative coordinate values.
If you select Polar Format, AutoCAD defaults to the use of relative polar
coordinates when both Relative Coordinates and Polar Format are
enabled. When Polar Format is enabled, you must type a , (comma) to
use Cartesian coordinate values. If Cartesian Format is chosen, you must
type < (angle symbol) to use polar formats.

4. Under Visibility, select When a Command Asks for a Point.
Selecting When a Command Asks for a Point displays dynamic tooltips
only when a command is active; this is the default option. The option

6. On the Dynamic Input tab, under the Dimension Input area, click
Settings.
AutoCAD displays the Dimension Input Settings dialog box (see Figure 7-6).
7. In the Dimension Input Settings dialog box, under the Visibility area,
select Show 2 Dimension Input Fields at a Time.
This lets up to two dynamic input tooltips be displayed at a time; this is
the default option. For example, when using the LINE command, a tooltip
for distance and a second tooltip for angle are displayed. Not all com-
mands support two dynamic tooltips; for example, the CIRCLE command
displays only a distance tooltip for the radius/diameter of the circle.
When Show 1 Dimension Input Fields at a Time is set, only the 
primary dimension tooltip is displayed. The last option, Show the Follow-
ing Dimension Input Fields Simultaneously, allows you to control which
dimension input tooltips you want to display when specifying a point.
8. Click OK.
AutoCAD returns to the Drafting Settings dialog box.
9. In the Drafting Settings dialog box, click Drafting Tooltip Appearance.
AutoCAD displays the Tooltip Appearance dialog box, which allows you
to control the color scheme, size, and transparency for the dynamic
input tooltips.
10. In the Tooltip Appearance dialog box, make the desired changes to
the appearance of the tooltips and click OK.
AutoCAD returns to the Drafting Settings dialog box.

Setting Grid and Snap
AutoCAD’s grid is helpful for getting your bearings in a drawing but is not
(strictly speaking) a precision aid. As I explain in Chapter 6 of this minibook,
AutoCAD can display a nonplotting grid of horizontally and vertically aligned
dots over the drawing area. This grid can help keep you aware of the relative
sizes of what you are drawing — and their size on the plotted drawing. It
also gives you a visual cue when you are drawing outside the established
drawing limits.
If you’re working in Isometric mode, the grid adjusts itself to a 30-60-90 angular
alignment rather than horizontal and vertical. I do not cover isometric or
other forms of 2D pictorial drafting in this book.
You can toggle the grid off and on with the Grid Display (GRID) button on the
status bar or by pressing the F7 function key. You can set grid spacing at the
command prompt, but it’s easier to use the Drafting Settings dialog box, as I
describe in a few paragraphs.
If you’re zoomed way out in a drawing and turn on the grid, you may see the
following message displayed at the command line:
Grid too dense to display
This message is not an error — it just means that the grid spacing is too small
for AutoCAD to display at the current zoom ratio. Either zoom in closer (if you
need to see the grid) or change the grid spacing (as I explain in just a moment).
Snap constrains the movement of the crosshairs to a specific increment; when
snap is enabled, the crosshairs can no longer move freely about the drawing
area but jump to points on an invisible grid. Snap, like grid, is toggled off and

Understanding Coordinate Systems
142
on by clicking the Snap Mode (or SNAP) button on the status bar, or by
pressing the F9 function key. Also like the grid, snap can be set to Isometric
mode. And finally, a polar snap is available when you have polar tracking
turned on. (I discuss polar tracking in the next section.)
The following steps explain how to specify settings and enable snap and grid
in the Drafting Settings dialog box:
1. Move the crosshairs around the screen and look at the Drawing
Coordinates area on the status bar.
If the Snap Mode (SNAP) button on the status bar is not selected, the
crosshairs move freely in the drawing window, and the current location
of the crosshairs is shown in the Drawing Coordinates area.
2. On the status bar, click Snap Mode (SNAP) and Grid Display (GRID) so
both buttons are highlighted or pressed in.
The grid turns on (it may be a little hard to see) and the crosshairs now
jump from location to location. The Drawing Coordinates area continu-
ously updates with the current location of the crosshairs and shows that
the crosshairs move in constant increments.
3. Right-click either the Snap Mode (SNAP) or Grid Display (GRID)
button and choose Settings.
The Drafting Settings dialog box appears with the Snap and Grid tab
active (see Figure 7-8).
Figure 7-8:

4. In the Grid Spacing area, enter values for the x (horizontal) and y (ver-
tical) spacing of the grid.
Entering the x spacing first causes the same value to appear in the 
y spacing box. For different x and y spacing, enter a new value in the 
y spacing box.
5. To configure rectangular snap: In the Snap Spacing area, enter values
for the x and y spacing.
As with setting grid spacing, entering a value for x spacing causes the
same value to appear as the y spacing.
7. To set up snap and grid for isometric drawing: In the Snap Type area,
select Grid Snap and then select Isometric Snap.
When isometric snap is enabled, both grid and snap adjust from hori-
zontal and vertical to 30-60-90 angles.
8. If you’re using polar tracking, select PolarSnap in the Snap Type area.
Selecting PolarSnap disables the settings in the Snap Spacing area and
enables the Polar Spacing area in which you can enter a polar distance.
9. Select the Snap On or Grid On check boxes to enable or disable snap
or grid mode.
10. Click OK.
AutoCAD returns to the drawing window. The grid is displayed and the
crosshairs snap to the specified x and y snap spacing.
It’s not actually necessary to open the Drafting Settings dialog box to toggle
snap and grid off and on — just use the status bar buttons or F7/F9 function
keys.
You can change the snap origin and snap angle used for rectangular snap
mode. The snap origin controls the starting point for a hatch pattern when
using the HATCH command. I cover the HATCH command in Book III,
Chapter 3. The snap angle rotates the snap points and the grid based on the
specified angle. The crosshairs also rotate to match the entered angle.
Understanding Ortho and Polar Tracking
Ortho mode and polar tracking are two precision drafting aids that force the
crosshairs to a specific angle. Ortho mode has been part of AutoCAD since
the very beginning. When ortho mode is on, you can draw lines or choose
points horizontally or vertically only along a vector based on the previous
selected point. This is handy, but most drawings could use some consistent
angular guidance beyond 90-degree increments. Polar tracking allows you to
draw lines along specified angles other than in 90-degree increments.

Understanding Ortho and Polar Tracking
144
Using ortho mode
Ortho mode could hardly be simpler. There are no settings to change; it’s
either on or it’s off. If you find yourself drawing lots of horizontal and verti-
cal lines, it’s perfect for creating right-angled linework. To toggle ortho mode
off and on, click the Ortho Mode (ORTHO) button on the status bar or use
the F8 function key.
Using polar tracking
It’s a rule in AutoCAD (and in life!) that with flexibility comes complexity. Polar
tracking is a lot more flexible than ortho mode, and polar tracking has a ton
more options than ortho mode (hey, one more option would be a lot more!).
You can right-click the Polar Tracking (POLAR) button on the status bar.
From the shortcut menu, you can change the current polar angle by select-
ing one of the standard or additional angles that you added.
Options can make things feel more complex and even more confusing than
necessary by using the same words for features that seem similar but are
actually different. Tracking is one of those words. In this section I describe
polar tracking, where AutoCAD displays “tracking vectors” to show you
when you’re on a preset polar tracking angle. At the end of this chapter I dis-
cuss object snap tracking (after I have told you what object snaps are, of
course!). With object snap tracking, you use points on existing objects to
find new points in a drawing that do not exist on other objects.
Simple stuff first: To enable polar tracking, click the Polar Tracking (POLAR)
button on the status bar or press the F10 function key.
Where ortho mode forces you to draw horizontal and vertical lines and noth-
ing else, polar tracking gently guides you along the right path by displaying a
tooltip and a tracking vector to verify that you’re heading the right way. All
in all, polar is a kinder, gentler — and did I say more flexible? — version of
ortho mode.
The default angle setting for polar tracking is 90 degrees, which means you
can use it instead of ortho mode. Having polar tracking turned on with the
default setting means that you can draw at any angle, but you see a tooltip
when you’re on a horizontal or vertical path.
Polar tracking and ortho mode can’t both be on at the same time; enabling
one disables the other. If you’re like many experienced drafters, you may
consign ortho mode to the virtual trash can.

The following steps explain how to configure and use polar tracking:
1. On the status bar, click the Polar Tracking (POLAR) button so it is not
highlighted or pressed in.
2. Start the LINE command, pick a start point, and then move the
crosshairs around the drawing window.
There is no restriction or input on where you pick the next point of the line.
3. On the status bar, right-click the Polar Tracking (POLAR) button and
choose Settings.
AutoCAD displays the Drafting Settings dialog box with the Polar
Tracking tab current (see Figure 7-9).
4. In the Polar Angle Settings area, select the Increment Angle (angles
and their multiples that you want to track on-screen) drop-down list
and then one of the available angles.
Standard subdivisions of 90 degrees appear in the drop-down list. AutoCAD
also recognizes multiples of increment angles; for example, if you select 45
degrees from the list, AutoCAD also locks on 135, 225, and 315 degrees.
Figure 7-9:

Settings
dialog box.

Understanding Ortho and Polar Tracking
146
5. Select the Additional Angles box, and then click New to add addi-
tional angles to polar tracking mode that are not listed in the
Increment Angle drop-down list.
AutoCAD does not track multiples of Additional Angles you enter; if you
enter 16.87 degrees, polar tracking will recognize that angle only, not
33.74 degrees or other multiples of the original.
6. In the Object Snap Tracking Settings area, choose which tracking vec-
tors you want to appear when using object snap tracking to find
points.
Select Track Orthogonally Only (the default setting) to display only hori-
zontal and vertical tracking vectors, or Track Using All Polar Angle Settings
to display all the Increment and Additional angles you specified in the
Polar Angle Settings area. Note that this has an effect only if the Object
Snap Tracking (OTRACK) button is enabled. I cover object snap tracking
at the end of this chapter.
Although object snap tracking settings appear on the same tab as polar
tracking angles, they’re independent of one another. Regardless of whether
you choose Track Orthogonally Only or Track Using All Polar Angle
Settings, when you’re drawing stuff, all tracking angles show up. The
object snap tracking settings only kick in if you’re actually tracking from
one object snap point to another — that is, the Object Snap Tracking
(OTRACK) button on the status bar is enabled. Are you lost yet? Don’t
worry; I discuss object snaps in the following section and object snap
tracking at the end of the chapter.
7. In the Polar Angle Measurement area, choose how the polar angles
are to be measured.
Selecting Absolute is the least likely to get you lost because the tracking
angles are the same as the angular measure you set up in the Units
dialog box; that is, 0 degrees is to the right, 90 degrees is straight up,
and so on. Selecting Relative to Last Segment would display a vector at,
say 45 degrees to the last line, which will probably not be the same as
the absolute angle of 45 degrees.
When you’re familiar with the system, of course, it’s fine to temporarily
set Polar Angle measurement relative to the last segment. But I think it’s
a good idea to use Absolute until you are familiar with the feature. If you
want, experiment with the Relative to Last Segment option to see which
option you prefer.
8. Select the Polar Tracking On check box to enable polar tracking.
9. Click OK.
AutoCAD returns to the drawing window.

Precision Tools

147
10. Move the crosshairs around the drawing window again.
Notice that the crosshairs snap to the angle listed under the Increment
Angles drop-down list and any angles listed under the Additional Angles
list box.
The Polar Snap setting in the Snap Type area and the Polar Distance in the
Polar Spacing area allow you to snap to points along the tracking vector at a
specified distance.
Clicking the Options button in the Drafting Settings dialog box takes you to
the Drafting tab of AutoCAD’s Options dialog box. For the time being, you
don’t need to change any settings here — the defaults all work fine. I cover
the Options dialog box in detail in Book IX.
Working with Object Snaps
Up until now, you’ve been relying on AutoCAD’s coordinate system to locate
points and draw objects. That’s fine, but if calculating and entering coordi-
nates were the only way of drawing accurately, you’d probably run scream-
ing back to a drafting board. After you use coordinates to get some objects
drawn, you can start using another important feature: object snaps.
Object snaps let you pick a precise point on an existing object; the point you
pick depends on which Object Snap mode you select.
Object Snap modes are different from object to object, depending on the
object type. For example, lines have endpoint and midpoint object snaps,
circles have center and quadrant object snaps, and arcs have endpoints,
midpoints, centers, and quadrants.
You can right-click the Object Snap (OSNAP) button on the status bar and
turn on and off different running object snaps from the shortcut menu.
New users often get confused by snap and object snap. Snap is a status bar
toggle that forces the crosshairs to jump from preset snap interval to inter-
val. Snap is available whether or not objects are in the drawing. Object snap
lets you find exact points on existing objects, such as the center of a circle
or the insertion point of a piece of text. Snap doesn’t need objects, but
object snap does.
You can use object snaps in two ways: They can be on and available all the time,
in which case they’re referred to as running object snaps, or you can select the
ones you want from a toolbar, shortcut menu, or the command prompt, for one

Working with Object Snaps

click only. These are referred to as single object snaps, or object snap overrides.
Because there are some extra wrinkles involved in setting up running object
snaps, I’m going to deal with object snap overrides first.
Table 7-1 lists the Object Snap modes and how you use them.

Some object snap modes require two picks to set and therefore can’t be used as
running object snaps. For example, you can find a point midway between two
unconnected points by choosing Mid Between 2 Points (M2P or MID2) from the
shortcut menu or keyboard, but you can’t set it as a running object snap.
Hardcore typists can use the keyboard to set object snap overrides by enter-
ing the capitalized letters in the table. To find the apparent intersection of
two objects, for example, you can enter APPINT or type END to select the
endpoint of an object.
You can use the OSMODE system variable to set multiple running object
snaps at once. To find out more about the OSMODE system variable, type
OSMODE at the command prompt and press F1 to open the related topic in
AutoCAD’s Command Reference guide.
For AutoCAD LT users, the Parallel and Extension object snaps were first
made available in AutoCAD LT 2007.

The following steps explain how to use object snaps:
1. On the status bar, right-click the Object Snap (OSNAP) button and
choose Settings.
AutoCAD displays the Drafting Settings dialog box with the Object Snap
tab current (see Figure 7-10).
2. Click the Clear All button.
All the object snaps are unchecked.
3. In the Object Snap Modes area, select Endpoint and then click OK.
Endpoint is set as the only running object snap and AutoCAD returns to
the drawing window.
4. On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Draw panel➪Line.
The LINE command starts and displays the prompt

8. Position the crosshairs near the start point of the line that you just
drew. When the Endpoint object snap marker is displayed, click in the
drawing window.
The first point of the line is started at the endpoint of the previous line.
9. Type @5<0 and press Enter.
The command displays the prompt
Specify next point or [Undo]:
10. Type MID and press Enter.
The command displays the prompt

The Midpoint object snap is used as an override for the Endpoint run-
ning object snap.
11. Position the crosshairs near the middle of the first line that was
drawn. When the Midpoint object snap marker is displayed, click in
the drawing window.
You should get an object that resembles a triangle on a stick, like the
one shown in Figure 7-11.
12. Press Enter to end the LINE command.
Using Point Filters
Sometimes it’s useful to use part of a location’s coordinates to locate a point
in a drawing. You can find the center of a circle by using object snaps. But
suppose you want to find the precise middle point of a square. Squares and
rectangles don’t have “centers” in the same way that circles do.
Using point filters (also known as dot filters or xy filters), you can locate a new
point by combining the x coordinate from one point with the y coordinate
from another (and, if you’re working in 3D, the z coordinate from a third). It’s
a complicated system, and it takes some practice, but if you feel like taking

the AutoCAD Point Filter Challenge, follow these steps to draw a circle at the
center of a rectangle:
1. Open a drawing containing a rectangular area in which you want to
draw a circle, or create a new drawing and draw a rectangle.
2. On the status bar, right-click the Object Snap (OSNAP) button and
choose Settings. Make sure that Midpoint object snap is selected and
click OK.
3. On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Draw panel➪Circle, Radius.

7. Move the crosshairs over a vertical side of the rectangle and click
when you see the Midpoint object snap marker.
AutoCAD locates the center point of the circle at a new point generated
from the x coordinate of the first picked point and the y coordinate of
the second.
Working with Object Snap Tracking Mode
No, OTRACK is not the name of the Irish railway system. Sure and begorrah,
OTRACK is much more useful than that. OTRACK is short for object snap
tracking, an AutoCAD feature that lets you locate new points based on object
snap points on existing objects.
Object snap tracking automates the point filter process I describe earlier. For
example, here’s how you use object snap tracking to place a circle in the
exact center of a rectangle:
1. Open a drawing containing a rectangular area in which you want to
draw a circle, or create a new drawing and draw a rectangle.
2. On the status bar, right-click the Object Snap Tracking (OTRACK)
button and choose Settings to display the Drafting Settings dialog box,
and make sure that the Midpoint object snap is selected.
You can also right-click the Object Snap (OSNAP) button and choose
Midpoint if it is not selected.
3. Select the Object Snap On and Object Snap Tracking On check boxes,
and then click OK.
You can also click the Object Snap (OSNAP) and Object Snap Tracking
(OTRACK) buttons to enable both modes.
4. On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Draw panel➪Circle flyout➪Circle,
Radius.
The CIRCLE command starts and displays the prompt
Specify center point for circle or [3P/2P/Ttr (tan tan
radius)]:
5. Move the crosshairs to the middle of a horizontal side of the rectangle.
The Midpoint object snap marker appears.
6. Rest the crosshairs over the object snap marker for a moment but
don’t click.
When you move the crosshairs, you should see a tracking vector passing
through the object snap marker.

Working with Object Snap Tracking Mode
154
7. Without clicking, move the crosshairs to the middle of a vertical side
of the rectangle.
8. When the object snap marker appears, rest the crosshairs over it for a
moment.
Now when you move the crosshairs, you should see two tracking vectors,
one running through each of the midpoints.
9. Move the crosshairs until the two tracking vectors are aligned verti-
cally and horizontally (see Figure 7-13), and then click to set the
center point of the circle.
If dynamic input mode is enabled, you also get confirmation that you’re
on the money in the dynamic input tooltip.
For AutoCAD LT users, object snap tracking was first made available in
AutoCAD LT 2007.

elcome to Book II. It’s time to get primitive! No, I’m not asking you to
move into a tree in the backyard and howl at the moon. In this chapter,
I introduce AutoCAD’s primitive objects — or the basic objects if you will —
and the drawing commands for creating them. Primitive objects in AutoCAD
are lines, arcs, circles, and points.
After I explore the primitive heart of AutoCAD, I look at some of its more
complex object-creation tools. These include polylines, multilines (double
lines if you’re using AutoCAD LT), and some obscure entities such as traces
and 2D solids.
As I explain in Book I, you can interact with AutoCAD in several ways. You
can start most drawing commands from the Draw panel, the toolbar, or the
menu, or by typing the command name (or its short-form alias) at the key-
board. In nearly all cases, using any of these methods to start a command
initiates a dialog with AutoCAD.
Locating and Using the Drawing Tools
Table 1-1 tells you where to find all the drawing commands AutoCAD pro-
vides, as well as what you can do with these commands. We don’t cover the
commands in this order; just think of this table as a handy reference chart.
In the interests of fairness and democracy, Table 1-1 lists commands in
alphabetical order by command name, not by popularity or frequency of
use. Depending on the drawings that you create, LINE, ARC, and CIRCLE are
probably going to be the commands you will use the most.

If a command can be executed only by typing its name (that is, it has no tool
button or menu item), it’s not going to be used that frequently; SKETCH and
TRACE are in this category.
In this chapter, I’m not going to cover every single drawing command in
extensive detail — if you need to know more about a command I suggest
using the online Help system. The Command Reference has an alphabetical
listing of every command and details about each command’s options. To
access the Command Reference, choose Help➪Help or press the F1 key. Click
the Contents tab, and then click the plus sign beside Command Reference.
Sometimes you have to dig down into the Help system to find a command.
You can get to a command much faster by typing the command you need
additional help on and pressing Enter. After the command is started, press
F1 to open the online Help system to the topic on the command. You can
also position the cursor over a command on the ribbon, toolbar, or menu
browser and press F1 when the tooltip is displayed.
Let’s Get Primitive
AutoCAD’s primitive object types are lines, circles, arcs, and points. Each of
these object types takes very little input to define. A line is defined by two
endpoints, arcs and circles by their center points and radii, and points by a
single set of coordinates.
In this section, I look at the four commands that create these four primitive
object types. The commands are (which should not be much of a shock)
LINE, CIRCLE, ARC, and POINT.
Keeping to the straight and narrow
The LINE command creates a line object. In AutoCAD, a line object is defined
with two endpoints. You use the LINE command to draw straight lines from
point to point to point. The LINE command continues prompting for points
until you explicitly end the sequence by pressing Enter or Esc. Whichever
method you choose to start the command, the first prompt that is displayed is
Specify first point:
Pick a point in the drawing window, or use an object snap (see Book I for
more information on using object snaps) to find a precise point on an exist-
ing object, or type a pair of x,y coordinates to locate the starting point of the
line. After you pick the first point, the command displays the prompt
Specify next point or [Undo]:

Let’s Get Primitive
162
Specify the second and next points by using the methods just described. If
you make a mistake, or change your mind after you specify the second point,
enter U (for Undo) and press Enter to undraw the previous line segment. As
you continue to add line segments, you can enter U and press Enter at any
time to undo the last line segment you drew.
Command options appear inside square brackets. To select a command
option, type the uppercase letter in the option and press Enter.
Specify subsequent points in the same manner as the first points. After you
pick the third point (that is, after you have two line segments), the command
displays the prompt
Specify next point or [Close/Undo]:
There are now two options, Undo and Close. After you’ve drawn two line seg-
ments, you can create a closed shape by entering C and pressing Enter. If
you’re using dynamic input, you can select Close from the dynamic display
(see Figure 1-1). This draws one last line segment from the last point you
specified to the original starting point, which was specified when you
started the LINE command. To stop drawing line segments and exit the LINE
command, press Enter or Esc or the spacebar, or right-click and choose
Enter from the shortcut menu.
In Book I, I talk about relative coordinates and how AutoCAD interprets the 
@ symbol as relative to the last point you picked. You can use the @ symbol
by itself to tell AutoCAD you want to use the last point you picked in the
drawing window or entered by using coordinates. For example, if you enter 
@ at the Specify first point: prompt, AutoCAD starts the line at the last 
point entered.

Going around in circles
Circles are one of the basic objects that can be created in AutoCAD, although
you may not create them quite as often as you create arcs. I’m going to talk
about circles before I talk about arcs because circles are simpler to draw.
Even so, you can create circles in five ways — six, if you use the ribbon or
menus. Figure 1-2 shows the menu browser with all six options.
On the ribbon, click Home➪Draw panel➪Circle flyout➪Center, Radius, which
is the default method for drawing circles. the Circle, Radius option is the
default method used for creating a circle when you click Circle on the Draw
toolbar, or type CIRCLE or its alias C and press Enter.
If you start the command by using the default option, the command displays
the prompt
Specify center point for circle or [3P/2P/Ttr (tan tan
radius)]:
At this point, you can locate the center point by specifying a point in the
drawing window or by entering coordinates for the center point, or you can
choose one of the three options inside the square brackets.
If you specify a center point, the command displays the prompt
Specify radius of circle or [Diameter]:
Another choice to make! You can either enter a value for the circle’s radius
or specify a point in the drawing window to define the circle’s radius, or you
can enter D and press Enter to choose the diameter option. If you enter a
value or specify a point, the circle is drawn based on the specified values. If
you enter D and press Enter, the command displays the prompt
Specify diameter of circle:
Figure 1-2:
How many
ways can
you draw a
circle?

Let’s Get Primitive
164
If this is the first circle you’ve drawn in this session, no previous or default
value is shown at the command line. If you’ve drawn a previous circle, a
default value (the last-entered radius) is shown inside the angle brackets.
You can also draw circles by specifying two points that represent the end-
points of a line representing the diameter of the circle, or by specifying three
points that lie on the circumference of the circle. And yet another way you
can draw circles is by selecting two objects your circle should be tangent to,
and then entering a radius.
The Draw panel on the ribbon offers a sixth method that actually invokes a
macro; instead of prompting you to enter a radius after you’ve selected the
first two objects for tangency, AutoCAD asks you to select a third object.
Arcs of triumph
If you thought a half-dozen ways of drawing circles was a lot, you haven’t
seen anything yet! There are no fewer than 11 ways to draw arcs. Worse, the
default method — 3 points — is the construction method for creating arcs
that you’re least likely to encounter. Figure 1-3 shows the Arc command
options available through the Draw menu on the menu browser.
While you’re getting familiar with the program, it’s easiest to use the Draw
panel on the ribbon’s Home tab to choose the option you want. The nine
central options on the Arc flyout of the Draw panel are all based on start
points and center points, and then each has variations of endpoint, included
angle, direction, length, or radius.
On the ribbon, click Home➪Draw panel➪Arc flyout. Then click Start, Center,
End, for example, to preset the command options so that the three points
you enter are indeed interpreted as the starting point, the center point, and
the ending point.
Figure 1-3:
Eleven ways
to draw 
an arc.

Book II
Chapter 1
Drawing Objects
Let’s Get Primitive
165
One little gotcha is that by default, arcs are drawn in a counterclockwise
direction. Figure 1-4 shows how you control the way your arcs are drawn.
You’re probably aware that pressing Enter or the spacebar, or right-clicking
and choosing Enter, repeats the last command. What these actions don’t do
is repeat the last command options you chose. Instead, they repeat the com-
mand with its default options. In the case of ARC, that will give you a 3-point
arc, where the three points you pick are the starting and ending points and a
random point somewhere along the arc itself. Most of the time this is not
what you want.
The point of the exercise
After all that arcane arc knowledge, you’re probably ready for something
simple. You’re in luck — the simplest of all objects that can be created is at
hand. Points are defined in the drawing by an x-, y-, z-coordinate location.
You create a point object by using one of the methods for starting the POINT
command in Table 1-1 and then specifying a point in the drawing window;
you need to do nothing else.
Although I’ve been talking about x,y coordinate pairs, in fact every object in
a drawing is located by an x-, y-, z-coordinate triplet. In most cases for 2D
drafting, the value of the z coordinate is 0.
Although I’m dealing with 2D objects in this part of the book, the point
object is pretty one dimensional. Because points have no length or width,
they can be small and hard to see. The default appearance for the point
object is a single pixel, but you can change the appearance to something
more visible by following these steps:
Figure 1-4:

clockwise.

Creating Construction Geometry
166
1. From the menu browser or menu bar, click Format➪Point Style.
AutoCAD displays the Point Style dialog box (see Figure 1-5).
2. Select one of the point styles by clicking its icon.
The selected point style is globally applied to all point objects in the
drawing; you can have only one point style per drawing.
3. Specify the size of the point objects, and then click OK.
Set the point size as either a percentage relative to the screen size or in
absolute units. If you set the point size in absolute units, the point
objects appear larger or smaller as you zoom in or out; if you set the
point size relative to the screen size, point objects stay the same size as
you zoom in or out.
As I mention, the default point style is a single pixel. Click the top-left icon in
the Point Style dialog box to select it. The next icon to the right is no display
at all — that’s right, you can create point objects that you can’t see. Setting
the point style to nothing is ideal if you don’t want the point objects to
appear when plotting a drawing.
Creating Construction Geometry
In spite of snap mode, ortho mode, polar tracking, and object snaps, many
drafters use the software the same way they drew things with pencils and 
T squares — they draw temporary construction geometry to line things 
up and project drawing features from one view to another. AutoCAD has a
couple of construction geometry tools that help with this process: construc-
tion lines and rays.

Xlines for X-men
You create construction lines (commonly known as xlines) with the XLINE
command. Xlines (and rays) are unlike any other object in AutoCAD in that
they have infinite length.
Create a separate layer for your construction lines so you can easily turn
them off and on when you want to see your objects in the drawing without
all the visual noise. Construction lines and rays will plot, so be sure to turn
off the layer before you plot your drawings.
Although xlines look a lot like lines, they do not have endpoints, so you have
to construct your xlines accordingly. The following steps explain how to
create a series of vertical xlines, as shown in Figure 1-6:
1. Turn on appropriate object snaps.
This is an important step; because you’re going to be aligning your
xlines with existing drawing objects, it’s important that you place them
precisely.
Figure 1-6:

2. Start the XLINE command by using one of the methods in Table 1-1.
The command displays the prompt
Specify a point or [Hor/Ver/Ang/Bisect/Offset]:
3. Type the uppercase letter of the option you want. In this case, type V
and press Enter.
When you respond to the prompt, it doesn’t matter whether you type an
uppercase or lowercase letter. The command displays the prompt
Specify through point:
4. Use the appropriate object snap mode and pick a point in the drawing
window through which you want the xline to pass.
The XLINE command continues to prompt for points for new xline
objects until you press Enter or Esc.
If you want to lay down a whole bunch of xlines at different angles, don’t
select a command option first. Your new xlines will pass through the point
you pick, but you’ll be able to set the angle by picking in the drawing window.
This is an efficient method of laying out construction lines for a drawing if
you have polar mode turned on and the correct object snaps enabled.
A little ray of sunshine
The most significant difference between a ray and a construction line is that
a ray has one endpoint and extends infinitely away from that endpoint, but a
construction line has no endpoints and therefore extends infinitely in both
directions.
The following steps explain how to create rays:
1. Turn on the appropriate object snaps and enable ortho mode or polar
tracking as necessary.
As noted, construction lines and rays need to be created precisely to be
of any use.
2. Start the RAY command by using one of the methods mentioned in
Table 1-1.
The command displays the prompt
Specify start point:
3. Use the appropriate object snap mode and pick a point in the drawing
window where you want the ray to start.
The command displays the prompt
Specify through point:

Book II
Chapter 1

169
4. Again, use the appropriate object snap mode and pick a point in the
drawing window through which you want the ray to pass.
The RAY command continues to prompt for points for new ray objects
until you press Enter or Esc.
When should you use rays and when should you use xlines? Xlines are easier
to construct, because they need only a through point, whereas rays need a
start point and a through point. Really, the only advantage of rays is having
slightly less clutter on your screen — they disappear off only one side of the
screen instead of two.
For more on construction lines and rays, check out the User’s Guide in the
Online Help system. On the menu browser, click Help➪Help➪User’s Guide,
and then navigate to Create and Modify Objects➪Draw Geometric Objects➪
Draw Construction and Reference Geometry➪Draw Construction Lines 
(and Rays).
Without a Trace
Because the AutoCAD 2009 & AutoCAD LT 2009 All-in-One Desk Reference For
Dummies is nothing if not comprehensive, I’m going to cover the TRACE
command. As Table 1-1 shows, TRACE isn’t accessible through the user
interface or command alias. The TRACE command, which creates trace
objects (is that pattern settling in yet?), is a prime example of AutoCAD’s
attic. It’s really hard to throw anything away, even though it’s been 15 years
since it might have been one of the key commands in the program.
Traces had a function once. They were used in the preparation of printed cir-
cuit boards (or PCBs). Traces are more or less like lines with one significant
difference: Traces, like one or two other object types I’m going to cover
shortly, can have width. As with the LINE command, you can keep picking
points and AutoCAD will continue making traces, automatically cleaning up
the intersections as it goes.
Traces offer no benefits over polylines. (I cover polylines a bit later.) Traces
can’t have curved segments (polylines can). The TRACE command lacks
Close and Undo options like those in the LINE command. You can’t even see
traces as you draw them.
I’m not going to tell you not to experiment with TRACE — who knows, you
may find a unique use for that castoff in AutoCAD’s attic. For a very brief
description of the command, look up TRACE in the index of the online Help
system. Figure 1-7 shows you some sample traces.

A Bit Sketchy
170
A Bit Sketchy
Another command from yesterday is the SKETCH command. Like TRACE,
SKETCH isn’t accessible from the user interface or the command alias. You
have to type the whole command name to start it. The SKETCH command
doesn’t create its own entity type; the end product of a SKETCH sequence is
either a polyline or a whole bunch of teeny lines.
In its earliest days, AutoCAD had no commands for freehand sketching.
Enter the SKETCH command. Unless you use it every day (and I’m sure not
many people do that), SKETCH takes some getting used to because it works
unlike any other AutoCAD command. Follow these steps and you’ll see what
I mean:
1. At the command prompt, type SKETCH and press Enter to start the
command.
The command displays the cryptic prompt
Record increment <0.1000>:
Unlike with LINE, ARC, or CIRCLE, you don’t have to select or enter
points while you’re sketching — simply moving the crosshairs creates
the sketched entities. The prompt is telling you that any mouse move-
ments greater than 0.1 units will be recorded. Change this value now 
if you want longer or shorter movements to be turned into drawing 
entities.
2. Press Enter to continue.
The command displays this prompt (even more cryptic than the first
one, if that is possible)

Sketch.  Pen eXit Quit Record Erase Connect .
Sketch is ordering you to do something, unlike most commands that ask
you to tell them what to do.
3. Click the left mouse button to start sketching. Click again to stop
sketching.
Clicking the left mouse button toggles Sketch mode between <Pen
down> and <Pen up>. Simply moving the crosshairs a minimum of 0.l
units (or whatever record increment you specified) creates sketched
entities. The SKETCH command ignores object snaps, and it ignores the
right mouse button.
The system variable SKPOLY determines whether SKETCH creates polyline
objects or gazillions of separate lines. The default value of SKPOLY is 0,
which will generate many many many line objects. Setting SKPOLY to 1 tells
AutoCAD to create polylines from the connected sketch segments.
Drawing Parallel Lines
If you’re drawing something such as the floor plan of a house, you need par-
allel lines to represent the walls. The LINE command gives you a single line,
which you then need to offset or copy to get a pair of lines that can repre-
sent a wall. Both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT have commands for drawing par-
allel lines, but they’re different in each program.
AutoCAD LT provides a command called DLINE that enables you to draw
double lines. You specify a thickness, or separation distance, and then draw.
The DLINE command creates pairs of line objects that can be edited or
erased separately. The DLINE command is not included in AutoCAD. For
more on using DLINE, see Book IV.
Multilines (which are not included in AutoCAD LT) are multiple parallel lines
that can have different properties from one another. A multiline can have up
to 16 elements. You create multiline objects with the MLINE command and
edit them with the MLEDIT command, which provides a set of special tools
that are specific to multilines. I cover editing multilines in Chapter 2 of this
minibook.
Multilines definitely belong in the ranks of AutoCAD’s complex objects. To
use multilines effectively, you need to be able to create and edit the multiline
styles that format the multiline objects. And you need to be able to edit them
in the unique way that they require. Many AutoCAD users don’t like using
multilines because of their perceived inflexibility.
Figure 1-8 shows one example of a multiline object. Using the LINE command,
it would take 24 separate lines (and a lot of editing) to get the same result.

Drawing Parallel Lines
172
The following steps show you how to create a simple multiline shape:
1. Start the MLINE command by using one of the methods in Table 1-1.
The command displays the prompts
Current settings: Justification = Top, Scale = 1.00,
Style = STANDARD
Specify start point or [Justification/Scale/STyle]:
2. If you want to change Justification from the current value, type J.
Justification is either Top, Zero, or Bottom, and refers to where the multi-
line elements are located relative to where you pick your locations. Zero
justification centers the multiline elements on the points you pick. If
Justification is Top, and you draw your multilines from left to right, the
points you pick will be at the top element of the multiline. If you draw a
closed shape with multilines, drawing clockwise with Top justification
places the outermost element on the pick points. Logically, choosing
Bottom justification does the reverse.
If you find the MLINE command’s justification labeling confusing, you’ll
probably have better luck if you choose one justification (for example,
Top) and one direction (for example, clockwise), and stick to it.
3. To change Scale from the current setting, type S.
The default value of 1.0 draws multilines exactly as specified. So if your
multiline style has two lines with a 1-inch separation, that’s how far
apart they’ll be in your drawing. If you want to use this multiline style to
represent a 6-inch-wide wall, you change the scale factor to 6.
Figure 1-8:
One

plan.

Book II
Chapter 1
Drawing Objects
Drawing Parallel Lines
173
Rather than trying to do everything with a single multiline style, consider
creating styles for real objects by using real dimensions. For example, if
you want a 6-inch-wide wall, define the wall style so that the lines are 6
inches apart. That way you don’t have to even think about the Scale option.
4. Type ST to switch the current multiline style to another style.
The new style must already exist in the drawing; you can’t create a new
multiline style from the MLINE command.
5. Pick a start point or enter coordinates.
The remaining prompts are identical to those for the LINE command.
The MLINE command continues drawing multiline segments until you
press Enter or Esc to terminate the command. After the second pick,
there’s an Undo option, and after the third pick, a Close option.
Because multilines are single objects, they must be created according to a
defined multiline style. By default, every AutoCAD drawing contains a multi-
line style definition called Standard. The default Standard style is used to
create pairs of continuous parallel lines.
That’s how you create multiple lines with multilines. As for why you may
want to use multilines, I leave that up to you but offer the following list of
multiline shortcomings:
✦A sequence of multilines, such as the foundation drawing example, is a
single AutoCAD object, and therefore difficult to edit; frequently users
create parallel lines with multilines and then explode them to individual
lines. (I discuss the EXPLODE command in Chapter 2 of this minibook.)
✦Multilines can’t have curved segments. If you’re laying out a floor plan
and need curved walls, for example, you have to exit the command and
draw the curved segments with regular lines and arcs.
✦Multiline styles can’t be modified if there are any multiline objects
drawn with that style in the drawing. If you want a slightly different
style, you have to create a similar-looking multiline style and then re-
create the lines.
✦You can’t change the style of an existing multiline object in the
Properties palette as you can with other object types defined by styles.
✦Editing multilines requires a specialized set of tools and its own dialog
box (although in AutoCAD 2005 and later you can use some regular edit-
ing commands on multilines).
✦It can be nonintuitive — not to say, downright tricky — to define multi-
line styles.

Complex Curves
174
Complex Curves
Splines are smooth curves that pass near or through a series of control
points. A spline object can form a closed or an open shape. An ellipse is a
symmetrical, oval shape that can be closed or open (if it’s open, technically
it is no longer an ellipse but an elliptical arc — but AutoCAD still classifies an
elliptical arc as an ellipse). Ellipses are defined by a center point, a major
axis, and a minor axis. In its early days, AutoCAD could only approximate
spline curves and ellipses by creating polyline objects. (I say more about
polylines a little later.) More recent versions of AutoCAD have acquired the
math skills to create what are known as Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines — or
NURBS to their friends.
Lucy, you have some splining to do!
AutoCAD can create two types of splines; one type is the spline-fit polyline,
which I discuss in the next section. Industrial designers use splines to give
form to organic shapes, while a surveyor might use splines for contour lines.
Splines are created with the SPLINE command and are defined by an arbi-
trary number of control points. Depending on your needs, you can eyeball
your splines or calculate the coordinates of their control points for absolute
precision.
The following steps show you how to create splines and describe the
options of the SPLINE command:
1. Start the SPLINE command by using one of the methods in Table 1-1.
The command displays the prompt
Specify first point or [Object]:
2. Pick a point in the drawing window, or enter coordinates to specify a
precise start point for the spline.
If you type O at this prompt, you can select a spline-fit polyline to con-
vert to a NURBS spline. To create a spline-fit polyline, you must use the
Spline option of the PEDIT command. For more on the PEDIT command,
look up PEDIT in AutoCAD’s online Help system.
3. Pick another point in the drawing window, or enter coordinates for
the second point.
The command displays the prompt
Specify next point or [Close/Fit tolerance] <start
tangent>:

Book II
Chapter 1
Drawing Objects
Complex Curves
175
4. Type F to specify a Fit tolerance.
Fit tolerance determines how closely the spline object is defined based
on the coordinate points specified (see Figure 1-9). The default value of 0
forces the spline to pass precisely through the control points. Values
greater than 1 allow the curve to pass that point within that tolerance value.
You can use the Properties palette to adjust the Fit tolerance for the
spline if you specify a value that does not look right. I cover the
Properties palette in Chapter 2 of this minibook.
5. To create a closed spline, type C and press Enter.
AutoCAD makes its best guess at closing the spline shape, but needs one
more piece of information from you. The command displays the prompt
Specify tangent:
You can either pick a point in the drawing window to set the tangency
direction or simply press Enter to accept the default tangent direction.
6. To create an open spline, press Enter to accept the default choice, and
specify a start and end tangent direction.
The command displays the prompts
Specify start tangent:
Specify end tangent:
For each prompt, pick points in the drawing window, enter coordinates,
or simply press Enter to accept the default tangency directions.

Solar ellipses
Ellipses, like splines, are created as NURBS curves. Unlike splines, ellipses
are closed, symmetrical shapes. Elliptical arcs are similar to ellipses, except
that they’re open.
Drawing ellipses
AutoCAD provides two methods for drawing ellipses. You can define the
ellipse by locating the two endpoints of its first axis and one endpoint of its
second. Or you can locate the center of the ellipse and then one endpoint on
each of its axes. The following steps show you how to create an ellipse:
1. Start the ELLIPSE command by using one of the methods in Table 1-1.
The command displays the prompt
Specify axis endpoint of ellipse or [Arc/Center]:
2. To draw an ellipse based on its center, pick a point or enter coordi-
nates to specify the first endpoint of the first axis.
The command displays the prompt
Specify other endpoint of axis:
3. Pick a second point or enter coordinates for the second endpoint of
the first axis.
The command displays the prompt
Specify distance to other axis or [Rotation]:
You have three choices here: You can specify a point by picking or
typing a coordinate pair (the default method); you can specify a dis-
tance (that is, the length of the second axis); or you can use the Rotation
option to specify an angle between the two axes.
Acceptable angle values range between 0 and 89.4 degrees. The higher
the rotation angle, the flatter the ellipse, and a 0 degrees rotation will
generate a circular ellipse.
4. To draw an ellipse by using the default method, pick a third point
above or below the first axis, or enter a coordinate pair.
The ellipse is added to the drawing.

Drawing elliptical arcs
Drawing elliptical arcs is almost the same as drawing ellipses, except two
additional values are needed to specify the angles for the ellipse. The follow-
ing steps explain how to draw an elliptical arc by using the default method:
1. Start the ELLIPSE command with the Arc option by using one of the
methods in Table 1-1.
Using one of the user interface elements such as the ribbon or menu
allows for the most direct route to this function, which is actually an
option of the regular ELLIPSE command. The command displays the
prompt
Specify axis endpoint of elliptical arc or [Center]:
The Elliptical Arc command is actually a command macro that’s pro-
grammed to automatically choose the Arc option of the ELLIPSE command.
The second line takes you to the first step of drawing a regular ellipse.
Figure 1-10 shows the Arc option of the Ellipse submenu on the menu
browser. If you are a dedicated keyboarder or use AutoCAD LT, you must
type the A (for Arc option).

2. Pick points in the drawing window to specify the first and second end-
points of the first axis, and the endpoint of the second axis.
The command displays the prompts
Specify other endpoint of axis:
Specify distance to other axis or [Rotation]:
The final prompts allow you to set the internal angle of the elliptical arc.
3. Pick points in the drawing window to specify the starting and ending
points of the elliptical arc.
The command displays the prompts
Specify start angle or [Parameter]:
Specify end angle or [Parameter/Included angle]:
For information on the Parameter option (which doesn’t do much that
simply picking endpoints can’t handle), refer to the ELLIPSE command on
the Index tab of the online Help.
Complex Objects and Shapes
The last selection of commands and objects covered in this chapter are
more complex than most of those covered previously. Some, like polylines,
are extremely useful. Others, like 2D solids, are a lot less so.
2D solids
The first thing to be said about 2D solids is that they’re not 3D solid objects.
I talk about working in 3D in Book V. Here I briefly discuss another entity
type, the 2D solid. Solid here refers to a solid-filled 2D outline.
A long, long time ago, AutoCAD couldn’t create solid-filled areas. If you
wanted the effect, you had to use the SOLID command. A big drawback is
that 2D solids can have only three or four sides — no more. So you might
have had to create dozens of 2D solids to fill a randomly shaped area. The
other problem with 2D solids is that their three or four sides are always
straight.
Ninety-nine times out of one hundred, you can get the effect you need with
the HATCH command or a polyline with width. (I discuss hatching in Book III
and polylines in the next sections.) If you still think you need 2D solids, refer
to the SOLID command in the online Help.

Rectang, Polygon, Donut
No prizes for guessing what kinds of things that commands named RECTANG,
POLYGON, and DONUT make. (Actually you may have to guess, but I don’t
have any prizes for you!)
All three commands make polyline objects. A polyline is a very useful type of
object that can be used to draw any shape, as long as each part is connected
to the other.
Rectangles
The RECTANG command creates four-sided closed polylines with horizontal
and vertical sides. Command options allow you to draw rectangles in differ-
ent ways. You can
✦Locate two diagonal corners.
✦Locate one corner, and then enter values for area and the length of one side.
✦Locate one corner, enter values for length and width, and then specify
direction.
✦Locate one corner, specify a rotation angle, and then locate the other
corner.
In addition, before you pick the first point, you can
✦Set chamfer or fillet values so that all four corners are automatically
chamfered or filleted.
In drafting, a chamfer is a straight line that forms the transition between
two 2D objects that meet at an angle; one example is a beveled edge at a
corner. A fillet is a curved transition between two 2D objects; an example
is a rounded edge at a corner.
✦Set a width value so the sides of the rectangle have a 2D width.
✦Set elevation and thickness values for the rectangle if you’re working in
3D. I discuss setting the elevation and thickness in Book V, Chapter 4.
Polygons
Polygons, like rectangles, are closed polyline objects. Unlike rectangles, by
default polygons are regular: They have equal length sides and equal internal
angles.

Complex Objects and Shapes
180
If you want to draw irregular polygons, use the PLINE command.
The POLYGON command draws regular polygons of a minimum of three and
a maximum of 1024 sides. After specifying the number of sides for your polygon,
there are three options:
✦Edge: Locate an endpoint of the first edge, and then pick or enter a value
to locate the second endpoint.
✦Inscribed: Locate the center of an imaginary circle, and then specify its
radius. AutoCAD draws the polygon so that the corners touch the cir-
cumference of the circle (the circle is not actually drawn).
✦Circumscribed: Locate the center of an imaginary circle, and then spec-
ify its radius. AutoCAD draws the polygon so that the sides are tangent
to the imaginary circle.
Donuts
Now for the biggest disappointment of the whole chapter. No, AutoCAD does
not generate snack food when you run the DONUT command. Trust me —
it’s better that way.
AutoCAD donuts are solid-filled polylines (as opposed to jelly-filled pastries).
When you create donuts in AutoCAD, you specify an inside and an outside
diameter, and then locate them by picking a center point.
A common use for donuts (the AutoCAD flavor, anyway) is in structural engi-
neering drafting where you need to draw round reinforcing steel in a cross
section. You can specify an inside diameter of 0 to create a solid-filled donut.
Just like asking for “plain” at the coffee shop.
Polylines
A polyline is a single object that consists of one or (more usefully) multiple
linear or curved segments. You create open or closed regular or irregular
polylines with the PLINE command. Just like the LINE command, PLINE con-
tinues adding line (or arc) segments until you terminate the command.
Unlike the case with LINE, the objects you create with the PLINE command
are single entities. Figure 1-11 shows geometry created with each command.
The LINE command (on the left) created six connected but separate line
objects. The PLINE command (on the right) created one single object.

Ahhhh . . . Wipeout
No, you have not crossed the boundaries of time and space to find yourself
on a beach with surfers. AutoCAD supports an object known as a wipeout
that can be used to mask objects in a drawing. You define a wipeout similar
to how you create a polyline — except a wipeout must be a closed object. As
you pick points or enter coordinate values, the command automatically shows
what the object will look like as a closed object by showing the last segment
drawn from the current location of the crosshairs to the first point specified.
As mentioned, you can use wipeouts to mask objects. They can be handy for
creating electrical or P&ID symbols, where you might draw a series of lines
to represent circuits or piping. With the wipeout as part of the symbol, any
objects under the wipeout are not displayed in the drawing so you don’t
need to worry about trimming a line to the symbol.
Figure 1-13 shows an example of using a wipeout object as a mask for the table-
top of a conference table. Notice that on the left, no wipeout element is used
and you see the chairs extend under the table, while on the right, the wipeout
object makes the part of the chair under the tabletop appear to disappear.
Figure 1-12:

a polyline.

Book II
Chapter 1
Drawing Objects
Complex Objects and Shapes
183
To create a wipeout object, you use the WIPEOUT command. Use one of the
methods mentioned in Table 1-1 to start the WIPEOUT command. Then you
pick points or enter coordinate values to define the shape of the wipeout.
When you have finished defining the shape of the wipeout, just press Enter
or Esc. You can also enter P when the WIPEOUT command is first started to
convert a closed polyline to a wipeout object. You can choose to keep or dis-
card the original polyline object.
If the polyline is not closed, you can select the polyline and display the
Properties palette. In the Properties palette, set the polyline’s Closed property
to Yes. I cover the Properties palette in Chapter 2 of this minibook.
By default wipeout objects display their edges. To turn on or off the display
of the edges of all wipeout objects, use the Frame option of the WIPEOUT
command. Turning off the frame for wipeouts can help to keep the display of
objects in your drawing cleaner.

ost of the work you do in any CAD drawing file involves modifying
existing objects. You may need to move objects from one part of the
drawing to another, or you may need to copy them from one part of a drawing
to another, or even from one drawing to another. “Draw once, reuse as much
as possible” should be your mantra when you work in AutoCAD.
Of course, before you can edit an object, you have to tell AutoCAD which
object you want to work with. Sounds simple enough, but you can select
objects by using a bewildering number of methods. AutoCAD’s Options
dialog box is the place to begin setting your choices for object selection,
and that’s where I start in this chapter.
Setting Selection Options
Before I get to the actual selecting and then editing of objects, I need to
briefly explain the options on the Selection tab of the Options dialog box
(see Figure 2-1).
The six settings in the lower-left corner determine how you select objects:
✦Noun/verb selection: When checked (the default) allows you to select
objects for editing before you start an editing command. See “Object
selection modes” later in this chapter for more information.
✦Use Shift to add to selection: When not checked (the default), selecting
items one after another adds them to the selection set; to remove items
from the selection set, hold down the Shift key and select them. When
checked, press the Shift key to add objects to the selection set; clicking
a selected object removes it from the set.

Setting Selection Options
186
Selection set refers to any selected objects that are ready to be edited.
Only one selection set can be active at a time, and when you make a new
selection, the old selection set is replaced. A selection set can contain
any number of objects, even including everything in the drawing. It’s
also possible to save a selection set as a named group — see the later
section “Object groups.”
✦Press and drag: When not checked (the default), you click once to set
one corner of a selection box and then click again to set the other corner.
(For more on selection boxes, see “Selecting multiple objects” later in
this chapter.) When checked, you use Windows-standard pressing and
dragging with the left mouse button to set the selection box.
✦Implied windowing: When checked (the default), picking a point away
from any object starts an automatic selection box. Moving the mouse to
the left creates a crossing box, and moving it to the right creates a window
box. I explain the difference in the “Selecting multiple objects” section.
✦Object grouping: When checked (the default), clicking one object that
belongs to a defined object group selects every other object in that
group. When not checked, other group members are not selected when
one member is selected. See “Object groups” for more information.
✦Associative hatch: When not checked (the default), selecting a hatch
object selects only the hatch. When checked, selecting a hatch object
also selects the boundary used to create it.
Figure 2-1 and this list point out the default selection settings. The following
sections assume that these are the current settings. If you get different
results when you try some of these methods, open the Options dialog box
and make sure that the settings jibe with mine.

Book II
Chapter 2
Modifying Objects
Selecting Objects
187
Selecting Objects
You must decide two things when you see some drawing objects that need
editing:
✦How many objects do you want to modify? If there are several, are they
adjacent to one another, or are they scattered all over the drawing?
✦How do you want to modify the objects? Do you want to select the
objects first, or do you want to start the command first, and must you
start the command first in some cases? Or would you rather use another
method altogether? (For the last, I’m referring to object grips, which I
discuss near the end of the chapter.)
The first thing you have to work out is whether you want to perform an
action on one single object or modify a group of separate objects. Selecting a
single object is (to use some technical language) a no-brainer — you just
click it with the pickbox, and it’s selected.
The little square box at the intersection of the crosshairs is called the pick-
box, and whenever it’s visible, you can use the crosshairs to select objects.
The pickbox disappears from the crosshairs in any command in which you’re
being prompted to select a point. (And the crosshairs disappear from the
pickbox when AutoCAD asks you to select an object.) By default, the pickbox
measures 3 pixels square; you can alter the size by using the Pickbox Size
slider on the Selection tab of the Options dialog box (refer to Figure 2-1), or by
typing PICKBOX at the command prompt and specifying a new value.
Selecting multiple objects
If you start your editing process by selecting one of the Modify commands,
AutoCAD prompts you to select objects. Use one of the following techniques
to do so:
✦To select a single object, position the pickbox over the object and click.
✦To invoke an automatic window selection box, pick a point above and to
the left of the objects you want to select, and then move the crosshairs
up and down and to the right to create a window box around the objects.
✦To invoke an automatic crossing selection box, pick a point above and to
the right of the objects you want to select, and then move your crosshairs
up and down and to the left to create a crossing box around the objects.
✦To invoke any other option, enter the capitalized parts of the option
name as follows: Last, ALL, Fence, WPolygon, CPolygon, Add, Remove,
and Previous.

188
Table 2-1 lists all the selection modes provided by AutoCAD. You can invoke
any mode by typing the uppercase letters for the option (for example, F for
Fence, ALL for All).
Table 2-1
AutoCAD’s Selection Modes
Mode
Description
Window
Prompts for the first corner and then the other corner of a rectan-
gular selection window. Only objects completely within the selec-
tion window will be selected. Window boxes are indicated by
continuous border lines and by default a semitransparent blue fill.
Crossing
Prompts for the first corner and then the other corner of a rectan-
gular selection window. Objects completely within or crossed by
the selection window will be selected. Crossing boxes are indi-
cated by dashed border lines and by default a semitransparent
green fill.
WPolygon
Prompts you to draw an irregular shape around the objects you
want to select by picking points; after you’ve picked at least two
points, the boundary becomes self-closing. Only objects com-
pletely within the WPolygon boundary polygon will be selected.
WPolygon boundaries are indicated by continuous lines and by
default a semitransparent blue fill.
CPolygon
Prompts you to draw an irregular shape around the objects you
want to select by picking points; after you pick at least two points,
the boundary becomes self-closing. Objects either entirely within
or crossed by the CPolygon boundary are selected. CPolygon
boundaries are indicated by dashed lines and by default a semi-
transparent green fill.
Fence
Prompts you to draw a series of line segments through the objects
to select. All objects touched by the Fence line will be selected.
ALL
Selects everything in the drawing except objects on frozen or
locked layers, and objects in paper space if you are in model
space or objects in model space if you are in paper space. (Refer
to Book I for more information on model and paper space.)
Last
Selects the last object created that’s visible in the current display.
(This may not necessarily be the last object added to the drawing.)
Previous
Reselects the last selection set created. Only the most recent
selection set can be recalled by using the Previous option, until a
new selection set is created. The new set then becomes the most
recent selection set.
Add
Lets you continue to add objects to a selection set. (You can add to
the selection set also by simply picking more objects.)
Remove
Removes selected objects from a selection set. (You can remove
selected objects from the selection set also by holding down the
Shift key and picking them.)

Selecting Objects
189
Figure 2-2 shows the results of selecting objects by using Window, Crossing,
WPolygon, CPolygon, and Fence modes.
In addition to selecting objects directly by using the different selection modes
I just mentioned, you can select objects also based on object type or a specific
property value. For example, you can select all the circles in a drawing with a
radius of 0.5 units. To select objects based on type or property values, you can
use Quick Select or object filters created with the FILTER command. These are
advanced topics that I cover in Bonus Chapter 5 on the Web, at www.wiley.
com/go/autocad2009aio.
When no command is active, you can use the key combination Ctrl+A to
select all objects in the drawing that are not frozen. You can also right-click
over the drawing window and choose Deselect All or press Esc to unselect
all the selected objects when no command is active.
At times, you may need to select overlapping objects. To select overlapping
objects, you position the pickbox over the object and then hold down the
Shift key while pressing the spacebar to cycle through the overlapping
objects below the pickbox. When the object that you want to select is high-
lighted, click in the drawing window.
Object selection modes
You can select objects for editing in two ways:
✦Verb-noun editing: Start the desired edit command, and then select the
objects you want to modify.
✦Noun-verb editing: Select the objects you want to modify, and then start
the specific edit command.

Selecting Objects

You’re probably wondering if this is AutoCAD or Grade 6 English. Don’t
worry; this is just the terminology that was chosen to distinguish the two
methods.
The following steps show you how to use each mode. As an example, I’ve
chosen the ERASE command because it’s one of the most commonly used
commands in AutoCAD, but the majority of the modifying commands work
with either mode:
1. In a new, blank drawing, draw some lines, circles, or other objects, or
open a drawing containing a number of objects.
2. Type ERASE at the command prompt and press Enter.
I cover other methods of starting the ERASE command in Table 2-2 later
in this chapter.
To use verb-noun editing, first start the editing command. The command
displays the prompt
Select objects:
3. Move the crosshairs so that they’re on top of an object, and then click.
The command line displays
Select objects: 1 found
Select objects:
4. Move the crosshairs until they’re not on top of an object, and then click.
With Implied Windowing turned on (see the previous section, “Setting
Selection Options”), move the mouse to the left to start a crossing selec-
tion box, or move it to the right to start a window selection box. The
command display the prompt
Select objects: Specify opposite corner:
5. Move the mouse to the right so that the blue window selection box
entirely surrounds an object or move it to the left so that the green
selection box crosses some objects, and click.
The command displays the prompts
Select objects: Specify opposite corner: 2 found, 3
total
Select objects:
6. Press Enter twice to finish selecting objects and to complete the command.
AutoCAD continues prompting you to select more objects until the cows
come home. Or until you press Enter to complete the command —
which, I hope, you’ll do first.
Still got some objects left to erase? Good! (If not, click the Undo button
on the Quick Access toolbar to get some of them back.)

7. Make sure that no command is active, and then use any selection
method you like to choose some objects.
If you need to, press Esc a couple times to make sure no command is
active. When no command is active, you can still select commands to
create a selection set. The command line displays the prompts
Command:
Command: Specify opposite corner:
8. Type ERASE at the command prompt and press Enter.
The selected objects are erased from the drawing and the command line
displays the prompts

Selection preview
Now that you know how to select objects in a drawing, you should know
about a feature known as selection preview. Selection preview allows you to
visually see what object you are about to select and to identify which
objects might be grouped together or are part of a complex object. As you
move the pickbox over an object, the object by default is highlighted and
appears in a heavier lineweight and dashed linetype. You can control
whether selection preview is used when no command is active and while a
command is active by using the Selection tab of the Options dialog box
under the Selection Preview area (refer to Figure 2-1).
You can control how objects are highlighted, which objects are highlighted,
and the fill applied to crossing and window selections by clicking the Visual
Effect Settings button under the Selection Preview area. Clicking this button
displays the Visual Effect Settings dialog box (see Figure 2-3). Make any
desired changes and click OK to return to the Options dialog box.

192
Object groups
The final object selection topic to mention is object groups. You know that
selection sets can be recalled for subsequent edits, but only until you select
a new object or bunch of objects — then the new bunch will overwrite the
previous set.
The object groups feature lets you save a selection set with a name so that
you can recall it at any time. You can have as many object groups as you
want, and individual objects can belong to more than one group at a time.
When object grouping is turned on, selecting one member of a group selects
the entire group; when grouping is off, selecting a group member selects
only the one you picked. You can turn object grouping off and on at the
Selection tab of the Options dialog box (see the previous section, “Setting
Selection Options,” for details). An easier way exists, however; Ctrl+Shift+A
toggles object grouping off and on.
The following steps explain how to create an object group:
1. Type GROUP and press Enter.
The GROUP command is available only at the command prompt. The
Object Grouping dialog box appears.
2. In the Group Identification area, enter a name in the Group Name
box, and optionally enter a description in the Description box.
All groups must have a valid name before you can select objects; a group
name can be a maximum of 31 characters and can’t contain spaces or
special characters such as #%&*. The description is optional.
3. In the Create Group area, select Selectable if it is not selected, and
then click New.
The Selectable option makes the group so it can be selected in the drawing.
The command line displays the prompts
Select objects for grouping:
Select objects: Specify opposite corner: 2 found
Select objects:
4. When you’re finished selecting objects, press Enter.
You are returned to the Object Grouping dialog box (see Figure 2-4).
5. Click OK to finish creating the group and close the dialog box.
AutoCAD LT does support groups, but it uses a different, and more limited,
procedure from regular AutoCAD. Rather than with the Object Grouping
dialog box, AutoCAD LT does its group work with Group Manager. For more
on working with groups in AutoCAD LT, see Book IV.

AutoCAD’s Editing Commands
Table 2-2 lists AutoCAD’s most common editing commands and tells you
where to find them and what they do. As with the drawing commands in the
preceding chapter, we don’t cover the commands in this order (which, in
case you’re wondering, is alphabetical by command name). You’ll find most
of these commands on the Modify toolbar and menu and a few on the
Standard toolbar and Edit menu. There’s also a Modify II toolbar, which con-
tains some of the more specialized editing commands.
To display closed toolbars, right-click any tool button and choose a toolbar
from the shortcut menu. If the toolbar shows a check beside its name, it’s
already open.
We cover an additional set of commands for editing text and dimensions in
Book III. I also discuss 3D editing commands in Book V.

Removing stuff
Everybody makes mistakes, and now it’s time to clear away the evidence. 
I present the simplest-to-use of all of AutoCAD’s editing commands: ERASE. 
I hope it’s not your most frequently used command, but it doesn’t really
matter whether it is or not — you’re not going to rub a hole in your screen
by erasing AutoCAD objects too frequently.
Here are some ways to erase objects from your drawing:
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Modify➪Erase, select the unde-
sirables, and then press Enter.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Edit➪Delete, select the undesir-
ables, and then press Enter.
✦On the Modify toolbar, click the Erase tool, select your objects, and then
press Enter.
✦Select the objects to remove and then press Delete.
✦Select the unwanted objects, right-click, and select Erase.
Relocating and replicating
Most commands require more direction than simply selecting objects and
clicking a button or pressing a key. The first set of commands I look at allow
you to relocate and duplicate existing drawing objects.
MOVE
Moving objects requires three sets of input: the objects you want to move, a
point to move them from, and another point to move them to.
Using noun-verb editing for simple commands such as MOVE and COPY
saves keystrokes. You don’t want to overwork those pinkies, do you?
The following steps explain how to move objects by using noun-verb editing:
1. Select a single object, or select several objects by using one of the mul-
tiple selection methods described in the section “Selecting multiple
objects.”
The objects are highlighted and the grips for each object are displayed.
Don’t worry about the grips (all those blue boxes and wedges) — I dis-
cuss them near the end of the chapter.

AutoCAD’s Editing Commands
198
2. Start the MOVE command by using one of the methods in Table 2-2.
Use object snaps or other precision aids if you need to. If you’re simply
moving objects relative to their current location, it doesn’t matter where
you pick. The command displays the prompt
Specify base point or [Displacement] <Displacement>:
The command shows you the number of objects that were selected, and
then tells you what to do next — it wants you to specify a base point
(“take these things from here”). If you didn’t select objects in Step 1 first,
the Select objects prompt would be displayed asking you to select
objects first before prompting you for a base point. Select the objects to
move and then press Enter.
3. Pick a point in the drawing window or enter coordinates as the base
point.
Sometimes you should pick a precise point for the base point, but if
you’re moving or copying something only a relative distance, it doesn’t
matter where you pick. The command displays the prompt
Specify second point or
<use first point as displacement>:
4. Pick a second point or enter coordinates for the destination of the
selected objects.
Remember, “second point” means “put it here.” The selected objects are
moved and you’re returned to a blank command prompt.
Even the simplest commands can throw you for a loop. You may get unex-
pected results if you press Enter in response to the Specify second point
prompt. Pressing Enter tells AutoCAD to look at the coordinates of the first
point and use those values as the displacement for the second point. I can
pretty well guarantee this is not what you want or will expect to happen.
COPY
When you use verb-noun editing, editing in AutoCAD is much more obvi-
ously a two-step process: You select the objects, press Enter, and carry on
with the command. This is a good time to demonstrate the difference
between selecting objects before and after a command is started because
the MOVE and COPY commands are pretty much the same.
The COPY command allows you to duplicate existing objects within a draw-
ing, and the COPYCLIP command allows you to copy objects to the Windows
Clipboard. You want to use COPYCLIP to copy objects between open draw-
ings; you should use the COPY command when creating copies of objects in
a particular drawing. After objects are copied to the Windows Clipboard, you

Book II
Chapter 2
Modifying Objects
AutoCAD’s Editing Commands
199
use the PASTECLIP command to create new objects based on those from the
Clipboard. Don’t confuse these two copy commands.
Use the following steps to copy objects, using the COPY command and verb-
noun editing:
1. Start the COPY command by using one of the methods in Table 2-2.
The command displays the prompt
COPY
Select objects:
2. Select the objects you want to copy by using any object selection
method.
If you choose a window or crossing, the command displays the prompts
Specify opposite corner: 4 found
Select objects:
3. Press Enter when you’re finished selecting objects to copy.
The first prompts for COPY are exactly the same as for MOVE. What’s
different is that I show how to copy objects by using verb-noun selec-
tion, and I showed how to move objects by using the noun-verb mode.
After you press Enter to finish selecting, AutoCAD prompts
Specify base point or [Displacement/mOde]
<Displacement>:
4. Pick a point in the drawing window or enter coordinates as the base
point.
Again, use object snaps or other precision aids if you need to. If you’re
simply copying objects relative to their current location, it doesn’t
matter where you pick. After you’ve picked the first point, the command
displays the prompt
Specify second point or
<use first point as displacement>:
5. Pick a second point or enter coordinates for the destination of the
selected objects.
You can enter relative coordinates, or use direct distance entry (see
Book I, Chapter 7) or any precision method (where appropriate), or eye-
ball a point. For example, typing @2.85<0 makes a copy of the selected
objects 2.85 units to the right of the originals.

AutoCAD’s Editing Commands
200
The command displays the prompts
Specify second point or
<use first point as displacement>: @2.85<0
Specify second point or [Exit/Undo] <Exit>:
6. Continue making additional copies or exit the command.
By default, AutoCAD continues offering to make copies until you tell it to
stop. To exit the command, press Enter, the spacebar, or Esc, or type E
and press Enter.
By default the COPY command operates in multiple-copy mode, which
means you keep specifying points to copy the selected objects. If you want
the COPY command to operate in single-copy mode, you set the COPYMODE
system variable to 1.
MIRROR
MIRROR creates a mirrored version of the selected objects, or it can create a
mirrored copy. Instead of picking a base and second point as you do with
MOVE and COPY, with MIRROR you pick two points that define an imaginary
mirror. The selected object is “reflected” on the other side of the mirror line.
The final MIRROR prompt asks if you want to retain or delete the selected
objects, known as the source objects.
The following steps demonstrate using the MIRROR command in verb-noun
mode:
1. Start the MIRROR command by using one of the methods in Table 2-2.
AutoCAD does its usual “Select objects” thing. By now you know the
ropes — select some objects and press Enter. The command displays
the prompts
Select objects: Specify opposite corner: 4 found
Select objects: Specify first point of mirror line:
If it doesn’t matter where the objects get mirrored to, just pick a random
point in the drawing window. Do the same for the second point. More
often than not, though, it does matter. If that’s the case, make use of
some of the precision drafting aids I discuss in Book I, Chapter 7. In this
example, the selected objects need to be mirrored precisely about the
middle of the rectangle.
2. Hold down the Shift key and right-click to display the object snap
shortcut menu. Choose Midpoint and pick a horizontal edge of the
rectangle when you see the triangular object snap marker.

Book II
Chapter 2
Modifying Objects
AutoCAD’s Editing Commands
201
The command displays the prompt
Specify second point of mirror line:
3. Hold the Shift key if ortho mode is disabled and click a second point
directly above or below the first point.
You need to be precise for the second point, too. Holding Shift temporar-
ily invokes ortho mode; when you move the crosshairs, they will lock
horizontally or vertically and remain that way until you release the Shift
key (see Figure 2-5). The command displays the prompt
Erase source objects? [Yes/No] <N>:
4. Type Y or N and press Enter to erase or retain the source objects.
OFFSET
OFFSET, like COPY, duplicates selected objects, but it’s more rigorous in
where it lets you put those duplicates. It also doesn’t make exact copies; dif-
ferent object types offset in different ways. Figure 2-6 shows the results of
offsetting different entity types. You can OFFSET lines, arcs, circles, splines,
ellipses, and polylines.
Figure 2-6:

Figure 2-5:

precisely.

AutoCAD’s Editing Commands
202
The following steps explain how to use OFFSET with the verb-noun editing
mode:
1. Start the OFFSET command by using one of the methods in Table 2-2.
The command displays the prompts
Current settings: Erase source=No  Layer=Source
OFFSETGAPTYPE=0
Specify offset distance or [Through/Erase/Layer]
<Through>:
2. Optionally, type E to erase the source object or type L to change the
new object’s layer from the same layer as the source object to the cur-
rent layer, and press Enter.
When offsetting objects, you can specify an offset distance or pick a
Through point in the drawing window. Logically enough, choosing the
Through option offsets the object through the point you pick in the
drawing. The first time you run OFFSET in a drawing, the default value is
<Through>.
3. Press Enter to use the Through point option.
The command displays the prompt
Select object to offset or [Exit/Undo] <Exit>:
If you simply pick a point, without pressing Enter to confirm the <Through>
option, the command assumes you really want to enter an offset distance
and you will be prompted for a second point. The distance between the
two points is used as the offset distance value.
4. Select a single object to offset.
You can specify only one object at a time; that is, you can’t select a
group of wall lines and offset them all in the same step. If you specified
Through, the command displays the prompt:
Specify through point or [Exit/Multiple/Undo] <Exit>:
For precise locations, use object snaps when picking through points.
The command creates a new version of the selected object through the
point you picked, and it continues prompting for additional offsets and
through points.
5. When you finish offsetting, press Enter to return to a blank command
prompt.
If you enter a distance, you need to make an additional pick to specify which
side of the source object you want the new object to be created on. The
following steps show the process:

Book II
Chapter 2
Modifying Objects
AutoCAD’s Editing Commands
203
1. Start the OFFSET command by using one of the methods in Table 2-2.
The command displays the prompts
Command: OFFSET
Current settings: Erase source=No  Layer=Source
OFFSETGAPTYPE=0
Specify offset distance or [Through/Erase/Layer]
<Through>:
2. Type an offset distance value and press Enter.
The command displays the prompt
Select object to offset or [Exit/Undo] <Exit>:
3. Select the single object you want to offset.
Because two possible directions could be used to offset the selected
object, the OFFSET command wants you to specify in which direction
you want to create the offset object by displaying the prompt
Specify point on side to offset or [Exit/Multiple/Undo]
<Exit>:
It doesn’t matter precisely where you pick, just so it’s clearly on one side
or the other of the source object.
4. When you finish offsetting, press Enter to return to a blank command
prompt.
Figure 2-7 shows the effect of offsetting a set of joined linework. The closed
shape on the left is a single polyline, and the shape on the right is drawn as
separate lines with the LINE command. For this kind of result, it’s obviously
best to use a polyline rather than separate lines — you’ll end up with no
intersection cleanup.

ARRAY
COPY makes multiple copies of objects by default. If it doesn’t matter where
the copies go, the COPY command is fine. However, if you need your ducks
in rows (and in columns, or even in a circle), the ARRAY command is for you.
ARRAY creates regular patterns of selected objects in either rectangular
(rows and columns) or polar (circular) arrangements. The following steps
explain how to create a rectangular array:
1. Start the ARRAY command by using one of the methods in Table 2-2.
The Array dialog box appears. Figure 2-8 shows the dialog box config-
ured for rectangular arrays.
2. Make sure to choose the Rectangular Array option (at the top of the
dialog box) and then click the Select Objects button.
The dialog box closes, allowing you to select objects to array.
3. Select one or more objects to array, and then press Enter to finish
selecting.
The dialog box reappears.
4. Specify the number of rows or columns or both, the row and column
offsets, and (optionally) a rotation angle for the array.
If you want a single row or a single column, specify 1 in the appropriate
box. Also, even though you’re making copies of a source object, the
number of rows and columns must include the number of copies you
want plus the source object.
Figure 2-8:

Modifying Objects
AutoCAD’s Editing Commands
205
You can also use the buttons beside the Row offset, Column offset, and
Angle of array boxes to specify distances and angles. Clicking any of the
buttons temporarily closes the dialog box and lets you pick points in the
drawing.
5. Click Preview to make sure that your ducks (or objects) are in a row.
A preview of the resulting array based on the values entered is displayed.
You can freely pan and zoom in the drawing to see the arrayed objects.
6. Right-click in the drawing window to accept the array as it appears
and to finish the command, or click or press the ESC key to return to
the Array dialog box.
In AutoCAD 2009 and AutoCAD LT 2009, you can now pan and zoom when
previewing the array before accepting it.
Choosing a polar array changes the look of the Array dialog box, as shown in
Figure 2-9. To create a polar array, you specify the objects to array, and then
you specify a center point, the number of items and angle to fill, and whether
the selected objects should be rotated as they’re arrayed.
Rotating and resizing
The next set of commands modifies objects by changing their size or orienta-
tion in the drawing.
Figure 2-9:

polar array.

AutoCAD’s Editing Commands
206
ROTATE
ROTATE spins the objects you select around a base point based on an angle
value, or by defining a reference angle and then an angle value. A typical
ROTATE command sequence looks like the following:
Command: ROTATE
Current positive angle in UCS:  ANGDIR=counterclockwise
ANGBASE=0
Select objects: 3 found
Select objects:
Specify base point: 0,0
Specify rotation angle or [Copy/Reference] <0>: 32
After pressing Enter at the last prompt, the selected objects are rotated.
You use the Copy option to create a copy of the selected objects and then
rotate the copied objects instead of rotating the original objects that you
select.
SCALE
SCALE proportionately resizes selected objects about a base point. You
specify a numeric scale factor or define a reference to specify the new size.
The procedure is similar to that for ROTATE: Select your objects, specify a
base point, and then specify a scale factor.
You use the Copy option to create a copy of the selected objects and then
scale the copied objects instead of scaling the original objects that you select.
Use the SCALE command if you need to convert a drawing done in millime-
ters so that you can work on it in inches, or vice versa. If you scale a drawing
based in inches by a factor of 25.4, the distance values (including the dimen-
sions) will be equivalent to true distances in millimeters. If you have to go
the other way, scale the drawing by a factor of 0.03937.
STRETCH
STRETCH stretches but also compresses. Perhaps it should be called
STRETCHANDSHRINK? Create a crossing window through the objects you
want to stretch and then specify a base point and a second point just like
you do with the MOVE and COPY commands. Objects that are fully in the
cross window are moved and not stretched.

Book II
Chapter 2
Modifying Objects
AutoCAD’s Editing Commands
207
LENGTHEN
LENGTHEN changes the length of lines, splines, arcs, and open polylines.
Start the LENGTHEN command and then choose the object you want to
lengthen (or shorten). The length of the object changes based on the option
you specify at the command prompt. It’s easier to adjust the length of some
objects by using grips, which I discuss near the end of this chapter.
Breaking, mending, and blowing up real good
AutoCAD has let you break objects for years and years. And what’s really
great is that you never have to pay for the stuff you break. Recent releases
also let you fix things (well, a few things, under very particular conditions).
But sometimes, there’s just no alternative to blowing things up.
BREAK
BREAK is a tricky command to master because you really, really have to
keep a watch on the command prompt. The normal function of BREAK is to
remove a chunk of an object, such as remove a piece of a line to make two
lines with a gap between them, or remove a piece of a circle to turn it into an
arc. The following steps describe how to use BREAK to create a gap in an
object:
1. Start the BREAK command by using one of the methods in Table 2-2.
You can use this command only in verb-noun mode. The command dis-
plays the prompt to select an object. When you have done so, the
prompt reads
Specify second break point or [First point]:
BREAK’s default behavior is to use the point where you selected the
object as the first point of the break. The second point is the other end
of the break; after the second pick, the command breaks the object and
then returns to a blank command prompt. This is usually not a precise
way of working, so most of the time you should use the First point
option.
2. Type F and press Enter to specify the First point option.
The command displays the prompt
Specify first break point:
Use your favorite precision technique to pick the exact point where the
break should start. The command then displays the prompt
Specify second break point:
Pick again to specify the second break point. AutoCAD removes the por-
tion of the object between the first and second points.

AutoCAD’s Editing Commands
208
Use Break at Point to break an object into separate pieces without creating a
gap between them — the objects meet endpoint-to-endpoint. Break at Point
is a command macro; you can achieve the same result by starting the BREAK
command and then entering the @ symbol at the Specify second break point:
prompt, but this way requires less typing.
JOIN
JOIN enables you to combine separate objects into single ones, as long as
some fairly stringent criteria are met. For starters, all objects must lie on the
same plane. Separated lines to be joined must be collinear. Arcs and ellipses
must be concentric. Lines and arcs can be joined to a polyline as long as you
select a polyline first. JOIN is another command that can be used only in
verb-noun mode.
EXPLODE
EXPLODE breaks up complex objects into their individual primitive ele-
ments. You can explode polylines, as well as multiline text, dimensions,
tables, and blocks. (I discuss multiline text, dimensions, and tables in Book
III and blocks in Book VI.) If you use EXPLODE on a polyline, the separate
entities (that is, lines and arcs) end up on the same layer as the original
polyline.
A related command called XPLODE explodes complex entities and gives you
a range of options you can set for the exploded objects.
Double-barrel commands
Love and Marriage. Horse and Carriage. Trim and Extend. Even though they
don’t rhyme, TRIM and EXTEND do work in similar fashion, so I discuss them
together here. And while I’m at it, I’ll talk about CHAMFER and FILLET as well.
TRIM and EXTEND
TRIM and EXTEND use existing geometry to modify other geometry. The
TRIM command lets you cut objects by selecting other objects that cross
them. The EXTEND command lets you lengthen objects by selecting other
objects that you want them to reach.
The following steps and Figure 2-10 describe how to use TRIM to shorten
and extend objects:
1. Start the TRIM command by using one of the methods in Table 2-2.
In this two-part command, you first select the objects you want to trim
with your temporary pair of scissors. The command displays the
prompts

Book II
Chapter 2
Modifying Objects
AutoCAD’s Editing Commands
209
Current settings: Projection=UCS, Edge=None
Select cutting edges ...
Select objects or <select all>:
The first prompt line displays the current command settings. To change
the Projection or Edge setting, use the command options that appear
after you’ve finished selecting your cutting edges. The second line tells
you that the objects you’re going to select will be used as the cutting
edges.
2. At the Select objects prompt, use any object selection method to
select linework or other drawing objects as the cutting edges, or press
Enter to select all visible objects as cutting edges.
After you finish selecting objects to use as the cutting edges, the com-
mand displays the prompt
Select object to trim or shift-select to extend or
[Fence/Crossing/Project/Edge/eRase/Undo]:
3. On the object that you want to trim, pick a point on the side of the cutting
edge that you want to get rid of, or choose one of the command options.
TRIM and EXTEND are such close relatives that you can actually run
EXTEND from within TRIM, and vice versa. To do so, simply hold down
the Shift key and select the objects you want to extend or trim.
Figure 2-10:

FILLET and CHAMFER
FILLET and CHAMFER offer methods of finishing off intersecting objects.
CHAMFER creates a straight beveled edge between two nonparallel objects.
FILLET creates a curved transition (actually an arc object) between two non-
parallel objects. FILLET can also create a semicircular connection between
parallel lines. Figure 2-11 shows a typical intersection after filleting and
chamfering.
Holding down the Shift key when creating the fillet or chamfer creates a
clean intersection, as shown at the right of Figure 2-10. This is like setting the
fillet radius or chamfer distances to 0.
Specialized commands
Most of the commands I’ve discussed so far can work on any type of object;
for example, you can trim or extend lines, arcs, or polylines. Some object
types are sufficiently complex that they require unique editing commands.
These specialized editing commands allow you to modify the geometric
properties of hatches, polylines, and splines, and they can be found when
the Modify panel is expanded on the Home tab of the ribbon (see Figure 2-12).
Along with these specialized editing commands, two other unique com-
mands come in handy from time to time based on the objects in the drawing.

These five commands for modifying graphic objects are as follows:
✦Draworder: Invokes the DRAWORDER command; move objects in front
of or behind other objects.
✦Change Space: Invokes the CHSPACE command; move objects between
model space in a viewport on a layout tab and paper space.
✦Edit Hatch: Invokes HATCHEDIT command; modify pattern, scale, and
other properties of existing hatch objects.
✦Edit Polyline: Invokes PEDIT command; modify width, linetype genera-
tion, curve type, and other properties of existing polyline objects.
✦Edit Spline: Invokes SPLINEDIT command; modify curve type, vertexes,
and other properties of existing spline objects.
For additional information on these commands, refer to AutoCAD’s online
Help system.
Changing properties
All the edit commands I’ve looked at so far have involved modifying or dupli-
cating objects in some form or other. But sometimes you may just want to
change an object’s layer or find out how long something is.
MATCH PROPERTIES
MATCHPROP is AutoCAD’s magic wand. Match properties copies object
properties (linetype, color, layer, text or dimension style, and so on) from
one object to one or more other objects, simply click the source object and
then the objects you want to change. You can use the Settings option to
specify which general property values are copied from one object to another
along with some special formatting properties that are specific to certain
object types.
PROPERTIES
PROPERTIES displays a window (or palette) of its own (see Figure 2-13) in
which you can see a list of every property (editable or not) of the selected
object or objects.
The Properties palette is a dockable window. Unlike dialog boxes, dockable
windows can stay open while you’re working in the drawing. And by double-
clicking their title bars, you can dock them — that is, anchor them — at the
left or right edges of the display.

status bar is enabled, the Quick Properties panel is displayed when you
select an object or objects.
The Quick Properties panel is new in AutoCAD 2009 and makes accessing
properties easier than using the Properties palette.

The Quick Properties panel can float over the drawing window or be docked
on the ribbon. To change where the Quick Properties panel is displayed,
right-click the panel and choose Location Mode➪Cursor or Float. You use
the Customize User Interface (CUI) editor to control the display of the prop-
erties on the Quick Properties panel. To display the CUI editor, click the
Customize button on the Quick Properties panel. I cover using the CUI editor
to customize the user interface in Book IX, Chapter 3.
SETBYLAYER
SETBYLAYER changes all general property overrides of selected objects to
ByLayer. You can use the Settings option to control which properties are set
to ByLayer. The properties that you can change to ByLayer are color, line-
type, lineweight, material, and plot style. I covered general properties in
Book 1, Chapter 5.
Changing your mind
I introduce you to UNDO in Book I and point out a little-known but useful
command called OOPS. Remember: OOPS restores the last things you erased.
UNDO undoes the last operation. Refer to Book I if you need a refresher on
the difference.
Coming to Grips with Grips
When you select objects, not only do they highlight, they also sprout little
blue boxes called grips. You can perform a number of editing operations by
clicking these grips and then following the prompts that are displayed at the
command line (or the dynamic input tooltip if you’re using it — and if you’ve
forgotten what dynamic input is, have a look at Book I, Chapter 3).
By default, grips appear as solid blue squares at specific points on selected
objects. Grip locations often correspond with object snap points, but they’re
not the same. To make a grip active, move the crosshairs over the grip and
click. You know it’s selected when its color changes from blue to a dark red
(see Figure 2-15).
Selecting a grip activates the grip-edit mode. The grip turns red to show that
it’s active. As soon as a grip becomes active, the command prompt is
replaced by a series of five grip-edit commands. When a grip is active, you
can choose the grip-edit commands and options in any of these ways:
✦Press Enter or the spacebar to cycle through the five commands. If you
go past the one you want, keep pressing Enter until it reappears. To
select an option, type its capitalized letter.

Coming to Grips with Grips
214
✦Right-click and choose the command or option from the shortcut menu.
✦If dynamic input is enabled, you can use the down-arrow key (on the
keyboard) to choose an option, although you must choose the grip-edit
command by right-clicking or pressing Enter or the spacebar.
If you’re using the keyboard, activating a grip replaces the command line
with the grip-edit commands. They look like this:
** STRETCH ** <Stretch to point>/Base point/Copy/Undo/eXit:
** MOVE ** <Move to point>/Base point/Copy/Undo/eXit:
** ROTATE ** <Rotation angle>/Base
point/Copy/Undo/Reference/eXit:
** SCALE ** <Scale factor>/Base
point/Copy/Undo/Reference/eXit:
** MIRROR ** <Second point>/Base point/Copy/Undo/eXit:
** STRETCH ** ... and round and round you go.
Each grip-edit command has options to change the base point or make multi-
ple copies. The **ROTATE** and **SCALE** options also let you use refer-
ence options.
Grips also have an automatic object snap; as soon as you move your cursor
close to a grip, it jumps to the precise control point.

hen you draw things in AutoCAD, you draw them at full size. If you’re
drawing the cross section of a 2 x 4 (or a 38 x 89 for our metrically
inclined friends), you can look at it full size, so that the screen width is the
same as the width of the actual piece of lumber. If your monitor is big
enough, you can even view a 2 x 12 (38 x 286) on your screen at its real size.
Sooner rather than later, though, it becomes uneconomical to keep getting a
bigger monitor as you need to draw bigger things.
Luckily, the ZOOM command lets you increase or decrease the magnifica-
tion of your drawing objects through a number of options, which I discuss
in this chapter. In addition to zooming in and out of drawings, you should
know some other display commands — PAN, NAVSWHEEL, VIEW, AND 
NAVSMOTION — because they’ll come in handy as you navigate your 
drawings.
PAN lets you move around in the drawing without changing the magnifica-
tion. The NAVSWHEEL command combines the ZOOM and PAN commands
into a single user interface that will remind you of a steering wheel in a car.
The VIEW command displays a dialog box in which you can save and restore
named views. NAVSMOTION command allows you to visually access named
views quickly from the status bar without using a dialog box.
Table 3-1 lists AutoCAD’s 2D display commands in alphabetical order,
together with how they can be accessed from the user interface and general
descriptions of what they do.

As you can see in Figure 3-1, the View menu of the menu browser has many
other viewing commands than those listed in Table 3-1, and that’s because I
cover only the 2D viewing commands here. The other commands on the
View menu that are not covered in this chapter are related to 3D viewing,
and I discuss them in Book V.
A Zoom of One’s Own
Zooming in closer and zooming out farther away should be simple enough,
right? But this is AutoCAD, where little is as simple as it seems. There’s a
host of options for the ZOOM command (some simpler than others), and
Table 3-2 sets them out for you.

Zoom Scale
Specify a zoom factor relative to the current display, the

Zoom Center
Pick a point or enter coordinates for the center of the view,
and then enter a magnification value.
Zoom Object
Select an object; the display zooms in on the selected
object which fills the drawing window.
Zoom In
Zooms in on the objects in the drawing by a factor (default
is 2x). Same as using ZOOM Scale and entering 2x as the
scale factor.
Zoom Out
Zooms out by a factor (default is .5x). Same as using ZOOM
Scale and entering 0.5x as the scale factor.
Zoom All
Zooms out to display the objects in the drawing limits. If
the drawing objects fall outside the limits, the option
zooms to show those objects (that is the command works
the same as ZOOM Extents).
Zoom Extents
Zooms out to display all drawing objects on nonfrozen
layers in the current drawing space.
ZOOM Previous, another command option, has its own button on the user
interface. Most ZOOM options are available from the Zoom flyout on several
available user interface elements. There’s also a separate Zoom toolbar, but
unless you have acres and acres of screen real estate, it’s probably more
space efficient to use the flyout on the ribbon or the Standard toolbar.
In case you have not encountered them before, a flyout button is distin-
guished by a tiny — and I do mean tiny — black arrow in its lower-right
corner. Clicking any button that has one of those arrows displays a subset of
buttons that start commands. Figure 3-2 shows the effect of clicking the
down arrow next to the Zoom flyout on the Utilities panel (which is on the
Home tab of the ribbon). Clicking and holding down the mouse button over a
flyout on a toolbar allows you to select one of the commands on the flyout.
To choose a command, run your mouse pointer down the button to the 
one you want, and then click or release the mouse button for a flyout on a
toolbar.

Book II
Chapter 3
Managing Views
A Zoom of One’s Own
221
You can zoom in and out of your drawings by using one of three methods:
✦Wheel mouse: The simplest method of all: Just scroll the mouse wheel
forward or back to zoom in or out of your drawing. By default, scrolling
the wheel away from you zooms in, and scrolling the wheel toward you
zooms out.
✦Realtime zoom (and pan): Start the command from a right-click menu or
use the Zoom Realtime or Pan Realtime buttons from one of the user
interface elements. Press and drag to change the view visually in the
drawing window.
✦Regular ZOOM command options: Choose a specific command option
from the menu browser or menu bar by clicking View menu➪Zoom, or
by clicking the Zoom flyout on the Zoom toolbar or Utilities panel on the
Home tab of the ribbon. The regular options do not zoom in real time —
you have to complete the command before the view changes.
When you use one of the options of the ZOOM command other than
Realtime, AutoCAD performs a smooth transitioning effect between the 
current view and the final view based on the input values provided. You 
can control when and how the transition effect happens by using the 
VTOPTIONS command.

Wheeling through your drawing
Although there are lots of powerful options for the ZOOM command, both
regular and real time, sometimes simple is good. I honestly cannot get
through the day without using a wheel mouse. If you don’t have one, drop
what you’re doing and go get one now!
Here are some of the reasons I like using a mouse with a wheel:
✦You can adjust the rate at which you zoom in and out as you scroll the
mouse wheel with the ZOOMFACTOR system variable. The default value
is 60, which means that each time you scroll you are 60 percent closer in
or farther out.
✦Starting with AutoCAD 2007, you can reverse the scroll direction of the
mouse wheel in the Options dialog box. On the 3D Modeling tab, select
the Reverse Mouse Wheel Zoom option. This works for 2D drafting as
well as 3D modeling.
✦Press down on the wheel and move the mouse to pan around the draw-
ing window.
✦Double-click the scroll wheel to zoom out far enough to show everything
in the drawing. (This is called a ZOOM Extents in AutoCAD and is cov-
ered later in this chapter.)
Before you start scrolling to zoom in, move the crosshairs to the part of the
drawing you’re most interested in seeing. As you scroll, that location will be
the center of the zoomed-in view.
Realtime zooming
Realtime zooming and panning are two halves of the same command. 
(I cover PAN Realtime in the following section.)
The following steps explain how to move around a drawing by using this
command:
1. Open a drawing that contains some objects that you may want to have
a closer look at.
If you’re new to AutoCAD and don’t have any suitable drawings yet, 
you can open one of the sample drawings from the C:\Program Files\
AutoCAD 2009\Sample folder (or C:\Program Files\AutoCAD LT 2009\
Sample folder for AutoCAD LT users).
2. On the status bar, click the Zoom button and press Enter.
(The Zoom button is the one with the magnifying glass and the plus and
minus sign.) The crosshairs change to a magnifying glass cursor with

Book II
Chapter 3
Managing Views
A Zoom of One’s Own
223
plus and minus signs, as shown in the middle of Figure 3-3. The com-
mand displays the prompt
Press ESC or ENTER to exit, or right-click to display
shortcut menu.
3. Hold down the left mouse button and drag the magnifying glass cursor
upward. Release the mouse button when you have finished zooming in.
As you drag upward, you zoom in closer to the drawing.
4. Press and drag again, this time moving the cursor downward. Release
the mouse button when you have finished zooming out.
Your view of the drawing zooms back out.
5. Take the third choice: Right-click to display the shortcut menu (see
Figure 3-4).
6. Choose one of the menu options or select Exit to end realtime zoom-
ing and return to a blank command prompt.
The shortcut menu (refer to Figure 3-4) presents the following options:
✦Exit: Exit the Realtime Pan and Zoom commands and return to the com-
mand prompt.
✦Pan: Press and drag the left mouse button to shift the current view of
the drawing without zooming in or out.
Figure 3-4:

Figure 3-3:

224
✦Zoom: Press and drag the left mouse button to change the magnification
of the objects in the current view.
✦3D Orbit: View a 3D model from different viewpoints (AutoCAD only). 
I talk about it more in Book V.
✦Zoom Window: The cursor icon changes to an arrow and a box (see
Figure 3-5). Press and drag to create a rectangular window; the display
zooms in to the area defined by the rectangle.
✦Zoom Original: If you change your mind about a Realtime Zoom Extents
you just performed, Zoom Original undoes it for you, restoring the previ-
ous view.
✦Zoom Extents: Zooms far enough out so you can see all objects in the
drawing.
PAN and ZOOM can be run as transparent commands. A transparent com-
mand can be started in the middle of another command; for example, you
might start drawing with the LINE command and realize the next point is off
the screen. Without leaving the LINE command, you can click PAN or some of
the ZOOM buttons and change your view. When you end the PAN or ZOOM
command, the LINE command resumes where you left off. You can run PAN
and ZOOM transparently from the command prompt by typing an apostro-
phe (‘) before the command name. When you use the wheel mouse to pan
and zoom, the commands are executed transparently without needing to use
the apostrophe (‘).
Pan in a Flash
The PAN command lets you change the view of your drawing without chang-
ing its magnification. You can pan around in your drawing in four ways —
that is, to look at different parts of your drawing at the same magnification
or elevation:
✦Realtime panning: Pressing and dragging when the PAN Realtime com-
mand is active lets you visually shift the display of the drawing.
Figure 3-5:
Zoom me 
a realtime

Book II
Chapter 3
Managing Views
Pan in a Flash
225
✦Realtime panning with a wheel mouse: Pressing and holding the left
mouse button down while moving the mouse lets you visually shift the
display of the drawing.
✦Panning by displacement: The old-style PAN command, where you pick
a base point for your view change on-screen, and then pick a second
point in the drawing that you want to see in the picked-point location.
This one’s as hard to use as it is to explain!
✦Scroll bars: As in every Windows program, drag the slider bar, click
either side of it, or click the arrows at the end of the scroll bars.
You can start realtime panning by using a number of options (it seems as
though there are always a number of options). The following steps explain
them:
1. Open a drawing that contains some objects that you may want to have
a closer look at, and zoom in on them.
Obviously, panning isn’t going to achieve much if you’re zoomed all the
way out in a drawing!
2. On the status bar, click the Pan button.
(The Pan button has four arrows pointing in opposite directions.) The
crosshairs change to the hand cursor, as shown in the middle of Figure 3-6.
3. Press and hold the left mouse button, and drag the hand icon around
the screen. Release the mouse button when you have finished panning.
The display pans in real time (meaning you can see the objects in the
current view move on-screen as you move the mouse).
4. Right-click the drawing window to display the Realtime shortcut menu
and choose Exit.
AutoCAD returns to a blank command prompt. Note that you can also
switch from realtime panning to realtime zooming with this menu.
Figure 3-6:

226
Alternative ways to start realtime panning are
✦At the command prompt, type P and press Enter.
✦Press and drag with the mouse wheel (or the middle mouse button, if
you have a three-button mouse).
✦With no command active and nothing selected, right-click anywhere in
the drawing and choose Pan from the default shortcut menu.
Be sure that no objects are selected and no command is active if you try this
last method — otherwise the Zoom and Pan options will not appear on the
menu.
To pan by using the mouse wheel or middle mouse button, the system vari-
able MBUTTONPAN must be set to a value of 1. I cover working with system
variables in Book I, Chapter 3.
Get a Grip on the Wheel and Hang On
Do not let go of the wheel or AutoCAD might spin out of control — okay
maybe not the same type of wheel that you might find in your automobile,
but AutoCAD does have a SteeringWheels feature. SteeringWheels is a user
interface that follows, or tracks, the movement of the cursor. It contains 
a variety of navigation tools that allow you to change the display of the
drawing.
The SteeringWheels feature is new in AutoCAD 2009 and primarily targeted
at navigating 3D models. Those using AutoCAD LT get only the 2D Navigation
wheel; users of AutoCAD get the 2D Navigation wheel along with three other
types of wheels designed for primarily 3D navigation.
In AutoCAD, the 2D Navigation wheel is accessible only when working with a
layout by default. However, if you set the NAVSWHEELMODE system variable
to a value of 3 before starting the NAVSWHEEL command, you can use the 2D
Navigation wheel in model space as well. Because AutoCAD LT supports only
the 2D Navigation wheel, the 2D Navigation wheel is displayed in model
space and on layout tabs.
In this section I talk about the basics of SteeringWheels and the 2D
Navigation wheel. I describe the other wheels in Book V when I cover 
navigating 3D models. Figure 3-7 shows what the 2D Navigation wheel looks
like and the tools on it.

Book II
Chapter 3
Managing Views
Get a Grip on the Wheel and Hang On
227
To display the 2D Navigation wheel, you use the NAVSWHEEL command; refer
to Table 3-1 to see how to start the command or click the SteeringWheel
button on the status bar. When you start the NAVSWHEEL command, the 
following prompt is displayed:
Right-click to display the shortcut menu. Press ESC or
ENTER to exit.
To close the 2D Navigation wheel, you can click the Close button or press
Esc or Enter.
The 2D Navigation wheel is divided into three wedges — a wedge is simply a
section of the main area of the wheel. The three wedges hold the Pan, Zoom,
and Rewind tools. Both the Pan and Zoom tools work similarly to the
Realtime Pan and Zoom tools that I discuss previously. To use one of the
tools on a wedge, position the cursor over the wedge and press and hold
down the mouse button. Then drag in the drawing window to pan or zoom.
The third wedge is the Rewind tool. The Rewind tool is similar to the Previous
option of the ZOOM command, except Rewind allows you to restore a previ-
ous view visually through the use of the Rewind user interface (UI) (see
Figure 3-8). If you click and drag over the Rewind wedge, the Rewind UI
appears, displaying a thumbnail of the previous views in the drawing that
can be restored. The current position in the Rewind history is indicated by
the orange brackets. You can restore the 20 most recent view changes. If you
click the Rewind wedge only, the previous view is restored.

If you’re using AutoCAD, not AutoCAD LT, you can control how wheels are
displayed by clicking the Wheel menu (the button with the down arrow on
the wheel) and choosing SteeringWheels Settings to display the
SteeringWheels Settings dialog box (see Figure 3-9).
Name That View
So if panning and zooming are that powerful and flexible, what more do you
need? Why should you find out about named views, anyway?
Imagine you’re on the phone to a subcontractor for your project, and you’re
discussing part of a drawing. You both have the same drawing open (you can
tell that from the drawing title!) but you have to refer to a specific area that
you’ve spent a long time detailing. The conversation could go something like
this:
“OK, zoom in to the room labeled Seminar Area. No, the one beside the office
corridor. No, the other corridor, the one by the elevators. NO, NOT those ele-
vators, the ones on the other side of the floor. OK, now zoom in on. . . .”
Or, it could go like this:
“OK, restore the view named Seminar Room NE detail.”
You can save a lot of frustration for yourself — as well as for others who
need to use your drawings — if you set up named views of important areas.

229
Along with making it easier to navigate a drawing, creating named views also
makes it easier to plot and set up layouts. You can plot named views from
the Model tab with the PLOT command, or assign a named view to a view-
port on a layout tab. Named are used also for working with sheet sets as
well. I cover plotting and working with layouts in Book VII, Chapter 3; while I
take a closer look at sheet sets in Book VII.
Creating views
The setup for saving named views has changed over recent releases of
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT. The View Manager dialog box has undergone
some minor changes to support new animation properties (see Figure 3-10).
The new animation properties are supported only in AutoCAD (sorry
AutoCAD LT users).
Figure 3-10:
The View
Manager
dialog box 
is used to

Name That View
230
The following steps explain how to create, restore, and modify named views,
beginning with steps that work in all recent releases of AutoCAD:
1. Zoom into and pan around your drawing until you’re looking at the
area you want to save as a named view.
You can define an area without displaying it exactly as you want to see
it, but for now, do the zooming and panning.
2. Start the VIEW command by using one of the methods in Table 3-1.
The View Manager dialog box appears.
3. Click New.
The New View/Shot Properties dialog box (see Figure 3-11) is displayed
if you’re using AutoCAD; the New View dialog box is displayed if you’re
using AutoCAD LT.
4. Type a name for the new view in the View Name list box.
5. In the boundary area, click the Current Display option if it’s not
selected already.
Figure 3-11:

231
If you want to define the area of your view within the current view, click
Define Window in the Boundary area. Then when prompted to define the
area, pick two corners. Ignore the other settings for now.
6. Click OK.
The View Manager dialog box shows the newly created view in its list
box, under the Model Views or Layout Views node in the tree view of the
Views area.
7. Click OK.
The location and magnification of the named view are now stored as
part of the drawing file. You can restore the view at any time. Try it with
these next two steps.
8. Perform a ZOOM Extents to restore the overall view of your drawing.
To zoom to the extents of the drawing, on the application status bar,
click Zoom. Then at the command prompt type E and press Enter.
9. On the ribbon, click View tab➪Viewports panel. Select the name of
the view to set current by clicking the down arrow on the View drop-
down list and then select the named view.
The selected named view is displayed in the drawing area. You can also
open the View Manager dialog box again and select the view you want to
restore and then click Set Current.
Other view options
You can associate layer settings with a named view. For example, you may
want to restore a view of part of a complex assembly, but you only want to
see the objects drawn on certain layers. The following steps explain how:
1. Zoom into the area you want to save as a named view.
2. Turn on (or thaw) the layers you want to see, and turn off (or freeze)
the ones you don’t.
Set the appropriate layer visibility states before you save the named
view. For information on working with layers, see Chapter 6 of Book I.
3. Follow Steps 2 through 5 from the preceding section.
Open the View Manager dialog box, and then the New View dialog box.
Give the view a name and make sure the Current Display option is
selected.
4. Select the Save Layer Snapshot with View option.
Selecting this box means that when you restore this view, the current
layer visibility states will also be restored.

Saving a layer snapshot is the default setting. Make sure you really want
to save the layer settings before clicking OK, because your previous
layer settings are not restored when you change views.
5. Click OK.
You return to the View Manager dialog box.
6. Click OK.
The named view is saved and you return to the drawing window.
You can easily change the boundaries of a view in the View Manager 
dialog box. Just select the view you want to edit in the list and click Edit
Boundaries. AutoCAD shows you a grayed-out view of your drawing with the
currently defined view highlighted in white. Then pick two corners to define
a new view area.
View Manager lists layout views as well as regular model views. Sheet views
are named views associated with viewports in drawing layouts as part of
AutoCAD’s sheet set feature.
The third category of view, after model views and layout views, is preset
views. These are intended for 3D use and serve no purpose in 2D drafting. 
I have more to say about these preset views in Book V.
Having AutoCAD Put on a Show
AutoCAD can show you more about your model than ever before by adding
motion to a named view. Prior to AutoCAD 2009, named views were used for
navigating a drawing, placing views on a sheet of a sheet set, or plotting 
a section of a drawing. Now with AutoCAD 2009, named views can tell — 
I mean show — you a story of the model.
With the introduction of the ShowMotion user interface (see Figure 3-12),
you can restore a named view quickly and easily through a series of thumb-
nails versus a dialog box or the View Control. Along with restoring named
views, you can also add motion to the named views that you create so an
animation can be played back when the view is restored. Named views don’t
need to have motion assigned to them to appear in the ShowMotion user
interface. ShowMotion isn’t available in AutoCAD LT.

After you create a named view in a drawing, you can restore it by using
ShowMotion or you can create new named views directly from ShowMotion.
Either way, you use the New View/Shot Properties dialog box to create the
named view. You assign motion to a named view by choosing a view type
other than Still from the View Type drop-down list. Then you specify the
properties for the shot on the Shot Properties tab (see Figure 3-13). After
you assign the motion and create the named view, you display ShowMotion
by using the NAVSMOTION command or by clicking ShowMotion on the
status bar.

To Regen or to Redraw . . . That Is the Question
234
To Regen or to Redraw . . . That Is the Question
To regen or to redraw that is the question. If the great William Shakespeare
had been an AutoCAD user, he might have had the same quandary as well. At
times you’ll need to update the display of the drawing window and you’ll
need to perform either a redraw or a regen. AutoCAD in recent releases is
pretty good about identifying when it needs to update the display by using a
redraw or a regen so there are no sudden productivity gaps.
So what is the difference between the two? AutoCAD maintains in memory
how a drawing should look for each open drawing. As you add objects to the
drawing window, AutoCAD keeps track of those objects in and out of the cur-
rent view. A redraw simply refreshes the display by indicating to AutoCAD
that it’s okay to clear the screen and display a representation of the graphics
it has been keeping track of without the need to recalculate the display
again.
A regeneration — or regen as it is most commonly known — tells AutoCAD to
discard the display it has in memory and start all over again. AutoCAD recal-
culates how all the objects should be displayed by looking at the information
in the DWG file that it has open in memory. A redraw can be done quickly
without any productivity lost, but a regeneration can take several seconds to
several minutes based on the size of the drawing. (Usually a regen takes a
matter of seconds, not minutes.)
You use the REDRAW command to redraw the display of the current view-
port and the REDRAWALL command to redraw the display of all viewports in
the current drawing. The REGEN command recalculates the display of the
current viewport, and the REGENALL command recalculates the display of
all viewports. When you use REDRAWALL and REGENALL, they affect tiled
viewports on the Model tab and floating viewports on layouts.

 Creating tables
You know the old saying about a picture being worth a thousand words?
I’ve done some digging and discovered that with the current exchange
rate and cost of living increases, a picture is now worth 3,712 words!
However, text is important, too. It’s a lot simpler — and more precise — to
specify a manufacturer and part number in numbers and letters than it is to
try to draw the darned thing from every angle. And until you can teach your
drawings to talk, adding text is a necessary part of drafting in AutoCAD.
In this chapter, I look at creating and editing text in AutoCAD drawings.
Text in AutoCAD
In AutoCAD, little is as simple as it can be. Take drawing text, for instance.
AutoCAD has not one but two kinds. You use one if you want to enter single
characters or short lines of text, and the other if you want to write a novel —
or at least some general notes. The first type is called single-line text, and
the second (wait for it . . .) is called multiline text (Autodesk also refers to
the latter as paragraph text).
An AutoCAD drawing has other kinds of text as well:
✦Leaders: Leaders are drawing notes that include a line with an arrow 
at one end that points to a drawing object. You create leaders by using 
a few dimensioning commands. I cover leaders in Chapter 2 of this 
minibook.

Text in AutoCAD
238
✦Dimension values: Dimension values appear as text and are formatted
according to a text style, but they’re not text objects — they’re an inte-
gral part of dimension objects. (I cover text styles later in this chapter,
and dimensions in Chapter 2 of this minibook.)
✦Attributes: Attributes are pieces of text attached to a block. What makes
them different from regular text is that the text is variable and can be
changed for each instance of the block that’s inserted into the drawing. I
cover blocks and attributes in Book VI.
✦Tables: Tables are another type of textlike object. Prior to AutoCAD
2005, you had to construct tables (for bills of material, drawing lists, and
so on) by creating a grid using lines and then carefully filling in the
spaces with text. Table objects automate the process; the text part is
defined with text styles, just like multiline text.
✦Fields: Fields are placeholders for textual data. You can place fields in
tables, in attributes, or in both single-line and multiline text objects.
Fields contain changeable data such as file name, date last saved, and
drafter.
I describe each of these types of text or textlike objects in the chapters of
this minibook.
Getting familiar with text terminology
Before I go on, I need to define a few terms:
✦Text: Text usually refers to an AutoCAD object, either a single line of text
(also called a text string) or a paragraph (called multiline text or mtext
in AutoCAD). TEXT is also an alternate command name for DTEXT, the
command used to enter single-line text.
✦Style: Style refers to a named definition of the way your text appears
when you place it in your drawing. Included in a style definition are the
font, height, width factor, and obliquing angle, and whether it will be
drawn backwards, upside down, or vertically. The style also defines
whether the text created using the style supports annotation scaling.
STYLE is also the name of the command used to create text styles. Text
justification and rotation are not defined in a style; they’re applied when
you start the DTEXT or MTEXT command. AutoCAD also supports styles
for other types of objects besides text, such as dimensions, tables, and
multileaders.
✦Justification: Justification refers to the direction that text flows from the
start point, and how subsequent lines of text align below the first line.
Left-aligned or left-justified text is the default in AutoCAD. I explain more
about the many justification options later in this chapter.

Book III
Chapter 1
Text: When Pictures
Just Won’t Do
Text in AutoCAD
239
✦Font: Font refers to the appearance of the letters, numbers, and sym-
bols. AutoCAD supports two types of font:
• AutoCAD shape (or vector) fonts
• Windows TrueType fonts
I go into more detail on both font types later in the chapter. For now,
understand that you must use a font file to define a style, and you must
have a style before you can create text objects.
If AutoCAD can’t find the font files used to create text, the drawing won’t
load or display properly. A large number of add-on fonts are available for
AutoCAD. However, you should use only the font files that come with AutoCAD
or Windows, in case you ever need to send your drawings to other offices.
Will that be one line or two?
Every version of AutoCAD from the very first right up to AutoCAD 2009 has
provided single-line text. The idea is that you type a line of text and press
Enter, and then press Enter again to end the command. You end up with a
single object — the single line of text.
You can create multiple lines of text by simply typing another line after each
press of the Enter key; you end the sequence by pressing Enter on a blank
line.
But picture this scenario. You’ve carefully laid out your drawing sheet, and
you’ve allowed a 4-inch wide space along the right side of the sheet for your
general notes. You add 40 or 50 lines of general notes as single-line text,
which means that you have 40 or 50 individual text objects.
Now your boss comes along and tells you you’re going to have to squeeze
those notes into a 3-inch wide column so you can add some more details.
Your mission — should you choose to accept it — is to edit each and every
line, removing a word or two from the end of the first line and adding it to
the second, and then removing two or three words from the second and
adding them to the third . . . and on, and on, and on.
There ought to be a better way, and there is, although it didn’t show up until
AutoCAD Release 13. When you create multiline (or paragraph) text, you
define a width for your text block by specifying a value or picking two points
on-screen. Multiline text wraps from one line to the next, just like your
friendly word processor.

Text in AutoCAD
240
There are plenty of differences between single-line and multiline text:
✦Single-line text has fewer formatting options, so it’s simpler to create
and edit. Multiline text has many, many formatting options, so it’s much
more complicated to create and edit.
✦To place single-line text in a drawing, you simply pick a start point and
type. To place multiline text, you specify two diagonal corners of a tem-
porary bounding box; the lines of text are placed inside.
✦Single-line text appears character by character as you type. To type a
second line of text below the first, press Enter and continue typing.
Press Enter on a blank line to exit the command. You enter multiline text
in a special dialog box called the in-place text editor. AutoCAD automati-
cally wraps lines of text based on the width of the bounding box you
specify when you start the command.
✦You create single-line text with the DTEXT or TEXT commands. You
create multiline text with the MTEXT command.
Why are there two commands for creating single-line text? Remember that
this is AutoCAD, where nothing is simple. By default, single-line text is cre-
ated with the DTEXT command. TEXT is now an alias for the DTEXT com-
mand; typing either at the command line runs DTEXT. But the folks at
Autodesk hate to throw anything away, so the old TEXT command is still
there in the latest releases. To run it, put a hyphen in front: -TEXT. Go ahead
and try it, and see why nobody uses it any more!
Single-line text is much more limited than multiline text in its formatting pos-
sibilities. You can define a few properties such as a single font or a preset
height in a text style, but that’s about it. You can go crazy in formatting
multiline text, changing things such as font, size, and color, and structuring
text in columns. Later in this chapter, I explain how to add and change the
appearance of both types of text.
So how do you choose which type to use? The usual advice is to use single-
line text for things such as letters or numbers inside grid bubbles or keynotes,
and for short one-liners such as view titles and scales. Use multiline text for
anything longer — certainly for anything longer than a couple of lines.
Justification
Justification (or alignment) refers to the look of a block of text on a drawing
or page. If you’re used to a word processor, you’re probably familiar with the
standard text justification options. Most text is left justified, like in this book.
You may prefer center-justified text for headings and titles. (Not me, I keep
to the left!) Rarely, you even see right-justified text, which means the right
margin of a block of text is neatly lined up, and the left margin is ragged.

Book III
Chapter 1
Text: When Pictures

Text in AutoCAD
241
Many books (although very few drawings) use fully justified text, where both
right and left margins line up tidily.
All these word processor options have their counterpart in AutoCAD. But
because AutoCAD is AutoCAD, it can’t leave well enough alone. It has six jus-
tification options that you can apply to single-line text (see Figure 1-1) and
nine options that you can use with multiline text.
Justifying single-line text
The single-line justification options probably make more sense to most
people because the line of text starts (or at least is based on) the insertion
point you pick. Left and right justified are plain enough, but the other
options need a bit of explanation:
✦Center: The point you pick is the middle point of the text’s baseline; the
text flows equally to the left and right from this point. Use this option for
a title that you want centered under a drawing view.
✦Middle: The text you enter is centered both horizontally and vertically
about the point you pick. Use this option if you want to locate a letter or
number in the center of a keynote or grid bubble.
✦Align: You specify two points for this option, and the text you enter
starts at the first point and ends at the second point. Aligned text main-
tains the height you enter, so characters are stretched or compressed to
fill the space.
✦Fit: Similar to align in that you pick two points, but instead of maintain-
ing height and changing proportions, fit text maintains the proportions
and changes the height to fill the space.
Figure 1-1:
Justifying

text.

Text in AutoCAD
242
If it’s absolutely essential that you have fully justified text (that is, straight
margins at both left and right ends), either Align or Fit is for you. Be aware,
however, that they’re rare in AutoCAD drawings.
These six options are not the only justification choices for single-line text; it
can also be justified to any of the additional nine options described in the
next section, “Justifying multiline text.” However, multiline text can’t be justi-
fied by using any of the six options described here.
Justifying multiline text
Multiline text is treated as a single object, and the insertion point is either a
corner, or the midpoint of a side, or the absolute middle of the bounding
box. Figure 1-2 shows the same block of text with the nine justification
options. In addition to these options, the text of a multiline text object can
also use paragraph alignment options, which are left, center, right, justified,
and distributed.
Where should text go?
In Book I, I introduce the two spaces that exist in every AutoCAD drawing
file. Let’s do a quick recap:
✦Model space is an infinitely large 3D environment where you create the
“real stuff” that you’re drawing. This is where you draw your house
plans or highways full size.
✦Paper space, which is accessible as a layout, represents your drawing
sheet, a 2D environment where you add the documentation that
describes the “real stuff.” This is where you place your border and title
block, general notes, view titles, and symbols such as section marks and
north arrows.
These are just guidelines, of course. A kazillion drawings out there (I know
because I have counted every single one of them) are drawn entirely in
model space or have dimensions and text in model space.
Figure 1-2:

Book III
Chapter 1
Text: When Pictures

Text in AutoCAD
243
In think that most text belongs in model space because of how drawing data
is exchanged not only with AutoCAD, but with other CAD-based programs.
When you export, import, insert, or reference a drawing file, only the objects
in model space on the Model tab are brought in or over because that’s where
all the important stuff is.
Scaling text for model space
In releases prior to AutoCAD 2008, it was a pain to figure out what size text
had to be created when you drew something at full scale but plotted it to a
another scale. Say that you’ve drawn a floor plan, and you want to put a title
under it, with the scale below that, as shown in Figure 1-3. Your office standard
says that titles are 3/16" high, and the scale reference should be 3/32" high.
The issue of calculating text heights has been resolved with the introduction
of annotation scaling, which I describe in Chapter 4 of this minibook. But you
should understand how to calculate text height manually because you might
have to work in existing drawings that do not use annotation scaling.
To make your floor plan fit on a drawing sheet, you’re going to have to scale
it — say, to 1/4"=1'–0". The scale factor here is 48 (refer to Book I, Chapter 6
for more on how to calculate scale factors). When you print your drawing,
that 8" wall is going to measure a little over 1/8" wide on the page. So text
that’s 3/16" high will be a teeny speck on the hard copy of the drawing. To
make your text visible and in conformance with your office standard, you
need to multiply 3/16" by the drawing scale factor. In this example, you’d
multiply 3/16 by 48 for a result of 9. When entering the text for the view title,
you need to make it 9" high. A similar calculation shows that the scaled
annotation needs to be 4 1/2" high.
Figure 1-3:

If you do a lot of this sort of thing, you probably have a cheat sheet table
(like Table 1-1, for example) with drawing scale factors applied to different
printed text heights.

Adding text to paper space
Did you say you wanted 3/16" text for your titles and 3/32" text for the scale
annotations? If you put these on your layouts in paper space, the text heights
will always be the same — 3/16" and 3/32" — regardless of the scale of any
views in the layout. Still want to put that text in model space?
Fonts
A font is a character set that controls the look of the formatted text.
AutoCAD uses fonts as part of a text style definition (I discuss text styles in
the next section). You have literally thousands of fonts at your disposal.
Some come with AutoCAD; some come as part of the Windows operating
system; some come with different software programs that may also live on
your computer. Remember, though, that you are drafting, not doing desktop
publishing or authoring Web sites. (Or maybe you are doing desktop pub-
lishing or authoring Web sites, but, if so, you’re definitely using the wrong

245
program!) In short, don’t get carried away with ransom note– or medieval
manuscript–style text. Your job is to present the text data on your drawing
clearly.
Types used by AutoCAD
Modern versions of AutoCAD can use two font types:
✦Shape (.SHX) fonts: These fonts come with AutoCAD and work only with
AutoCAD. Shape (or vector) fonts are made up of line segments and are
more efficient than TrueType fonts.
✦TrueType fonts: These fonts come with Windows. They give you lots of
fancy options but can slow down AutoCAD performance in common
tasks such as panning, zooming, and object selection.
Using fonts in drawings
You can use the default font you get when you start entering text the first
time you open AutoCAD, or you can configure the fanciest TrueType font 
on your system. I advocate a middle road, nearer the first option than the
second. My advice is to keep it simple and stick with AutoCAD’s shape 
fonts — preferably the ones that come with the program.
There’s a healthy aftermarket for SHX fonts, but they nearly always come
with a license that prevents you from distributing the font file to others. 
The same applies to TrueType fonts that you purchase or obtain through
installing other software programs. If your drawing is opened on a computer
that doesn’t have the fonts you’ve used, AutoCAD substitutes the missing
font with an alternate font and displays a message that a font substitution
has been made.
Two system variables control this font substitution process. FONTALT 
specifies a single font to use when AutoCAD can’t find designated fonts.
FONTMAP specifies the name of a mapping file that lists specific substitute
local fonts for missing TrueType, Shape, and Postscript PFB fonts. (AutoCAD
supported Postscript fonts for only one release, but probably hundreds of
thousands of drawings out there use them.) For more information on how to
configure these two variables, see the online Help index.
Working with Text Styles
Before you can add text to a drawing, you must have a text style — and luck-
ily, every AutoCAD drawing contains at least one text style. The default tem-
plates include two basic text styles named Annotative and Standard. Text
created with the Standard style uses the Arial TrueType font, which is differ-
ent from the clunky looking font that AutoCAD has used in previous releases

Working with Text Styles
246
called txt.shx. The named Annotative style is a direct copy of the Standard
style, except it is designated for use when creating annotative objects. Both
styles are defined with a height of 0, which means you’re prompted to spec-
ify a text height at the command prompt when creating a single-line or multi-
line text object.
A text style is a collection of settings that are stored in the drawing file itself.
Text style definitions include a designated font file, a height, and — depend-
ing on the chosen font — options such as width factor and obliquing angle.
Text styles are also used to designate whether the text objects using that
text style are all annotative text objects, unless the Annotative property has
been set for an individual text object, which essentially override the style’s
annotative behavior. I cover annotation scaling in Chapter 4 of this minibook.
Because text styles are created and saved inside a drawing file, they’re not
necessarily available in all your drawing files. If you create new text styles
and save them in a template (DWT) file, they become available in every new
drawing you start from that template. If you’ve created a nifty text style and
want to use it in another existing drawing file, you can use DesignCenter to
copy it from one file to another.
If you’re sufficiently seasoned, feel free to modify the Standard style. If
you’re new to AutoCAD, I suggest you leave the Standard style alone and
instead create a new style of your own. That way, if you mess it up badly, you
can always go back to the Standard style and start again.
The following steps explain the process:
1. On the ribbon, click Annotate tab➪Text➪Text Style (or on the menu
browser or menu bar, click Format menu➪Text Style).
The Text Style dialog box displays the properties of the current and all
available text styles (see Figure 1-4).
2. Click New and enter a style name (for example, MyNewStandard) in
the New Text Style dialog box, and then click OK.
The New Text Style dialog box closes and you return to the Text Style
dialog box. The new style starts as a clone of whatever the current style
is set to.
3. In the Font area, click the down arrow next to the Font Name drop-
down list to display a list of all available fonts.
The list contains all TrueType fonts installed in your Windows Fonts
folder and all AutoCAD shape fonts.

Book III
Chapter 1
Text: When Pictures

Working with Text Styles
247
4. Select a font from the list.
AutoCAD shape fonts are indicated by a teeny pair of dividers and dis-
play the SHX file extension. Windows TrueType fonts show a double-T
icon and no file extension.
The Roman Simplex font (romans.shx) is probably the most popular font
in AutoCAD because it combines efficiency with a much more pleasing
appearance than the default txt.shx font.
5. Click Apply and then Close to save the new text style definition and
set it current.
The Text Style dialog box closes. The new text style is now the current
style and will be used for all text added to the drawing until it’s changed
to a different style.
The remaining options in the Text Style dialog box modify the style defini-
tion in the following ways:
✦Font Style: If a TrueType font has style options (usually bold, italic, and
bold italic), they appear in this list. Vector (.shx) fonts don’t have
options, so the list is dimmed.
✦Use Big Font: “Big fonts” (is that an unhelpful name or what?) are special
vector fonts used in Asian language drawings. Regular font files contain
uppercase and (usually, but not always) lowercase letters, numbers, and
most of the symbols you see on your keyboard. Asian languages use
many more characters than that, and big font files contain the defini-
tions for those additional characters. For more information on big fonts,
look up Big Font file in the online Help system index.
Figure 1-4:
Get stylin’.

Working with Text Styles
248
✦Annotative: This option determines if the text placed in the drawing
with the text style is annotative. When a text style is annotative, the
resulting height of the text is determined by the viewport’s current anno-
tation scale and the height at which you want the text to be drawn when
plotted.
✦Match text orientation to layout: When the text style is annotative, this
option causes the text to orientate itself based on the current orienta-
tion of the layout on which the text is visible.
✦Height and Paper Text Height: When the text style is not annotative, the
value entered is used to determine the actual height of the text. So a
value of 4" is 4" in model space but might plot smaller when displayed in
a viewport on a layout based on the scale of the viewport it is visible in.
When the text style is annotative, the text height can look consistent on
both the Model tab and a paper space layout due to the annotation
scales assigned to the viewport and text objects. If a text style is defined
with a height of 0, you’re prompted to specify a height each time you
add text to the drawing. You can save this step (and help standardize
your drawings) by defining a height. I go into greater detail about anno-
tation scaling in Chapter 4 of this minibook.
Most of the time, it doesn’t matter whether you set the text height as
part of the style definition or leave it at 0 and enter a height every time.
But one situation where it does matter is when you define a text style to
use with your dimensions. In this case, the text height must be set to 0 or
your dimension styles won’t work properly. I explain all about dimen-
sioning in Chapter 2 of this minibook.
✦Upside down and Backwards: (What, no inside out?) These two text
effects are self-explanatory. You might use Backwards if you were going
to print on the back side of one-sided drafting film. I have bent over
backwards to figure out when you might want upside-down text, but I
haven’t come up with a reason other than maybe doing vinyl lettering or
creating injection molds.
✦Vertical: The characters are horizontal, but the text string is vertical,
like a movie marquee. Unless you’re designing movie theaters, you’re
not likely to use this option. It’s not available with TrueType fonts, nor
with many shape fonts.
✦Width Factor: This option allows you to change the width of the charac-
ters in a text string. Values of less than 1 compress the text, and values
greater than 1 expand it.
If you set the width factor of the text style for dimensions to somewhere
between 0.75 and 0.85, you’ll be able to make dimension text fit between
extension lines that might otherwise be forced outside them. For more
on dimensioning, see Chapter 2 in this minibook.

✦Oblique angle: This is for do-it-yourself italic! You specify an angle to
apply a slope to the characters. Positive angles slope the characters to
the right, and negative angles slope characters to the left. If you do any
isometric drafting, you’ll want to use this effect.
✦Preview: The Preview window shows you a sample of your text style
that changes as you fiddle with the properties.
You don’t need to open the Text Style dialog box if you just want to change
text styles. You can use the Annotate tab on the ribbon, which contains
drop-down listings of text styles and dimension styles and various other
styles. Just click the drop-down list and select the style to make a different
one current. The buttons adjacent to the drop-down lists open the respec-
tive style definition dialog boxes. You can also use the controls and buttons
on the Styles toolbar if you’re using the AutoCAD Classic (or AutoCAD LT
Classic) workspace, which doesn’t display the ribbon by default. The
AutoCAD Classic workspace displays toolbars and the menu bar for access-
ing commands instead of the ribbon. To set the AutoCAD Classic workspace
current, on the status bar click Workspace Switching➪AutoCAD Classic.
Creating Single Line Text
The following steps show you how to add multiple lines of single-line text to
a drawing.
1. On the ribbon, click Annotate tab➪Text panel➪Single Line Text (or
on the menu browser or menu bar, click Draw menu➪Text➪Single
Line Text).
The following prompt is displayed at the command line:
Current text style:  “Standard”  Text height:  0.2000
Annotative:  No
Specify start point of text or [Justify/Style]:
At this point, you can change the justification or style of your text input.
To stay with the default justification (aligned left) and style (Standard),
skip to Step 5.
2. To change the text justification:
a. At the command prompt, type J and press Enter.
The following prompt is displayed at the command line:
Enter an option [Align/Fit/Center/Middle/Right/TL/TC/
TR/ML/MC/MR/BL/BC/BR]:
b. To change justification from the default (left justified), enter the
uppercased letter of the option and press Enter.

Creating Single Line Text
250
For example, type M and press Enter to set your text input to middle
justified in the drawing. You have a lot of options here — I discuss
text justification earlier in the chapter.
AutoCAD does not retain changes to text justification. If you want to
place a number of middle-justified text objects, you need to specify the
Middle option for each one.
3. To change the text style, type S and press Enter.
The prompt below is displayed at the command line:
Enter style name or [?] <Standard>:
The current text style name is shown inside angle brackets. Just press
Enter to keep using the current style. If you want to switch to a different
style and you know its name, type it now and press Enter. The new text
style must already be defined in the current drawing. I cover text styles
earlier in this chapter.
4. For a list of text styles defined in the current drawing, do the following:
a. At the command prompt, type ? and press Enter.
This prompt is displayed:
Enter text style(s) to list <*>:
The default option is the asterisk wild card.
b. Press Enter and AutoCAD lists all text styles defined in the current
drawing together with their style properties.
Text styles:
Style name: “Notes”       Font typeface: ArchStencil
Height: 0.0000  Width factor: 1.0000  Obliquing
angle: 0
Generation: Normal
Style name: “Standard”    Font files: txt.shx
Height: 0.0000  Width factor: 1.0000  Obliquing
angle: 0
Generation: Normal
AutoCAD ends this command prompt sequence by redisplaying the
current text style name and resuming the regular DTEXT command
prompts:
Current text style: “Standard”
Current text style:  “Standard”  Text height:  0.2000
Annotative:  No
Specify height <0.2000>:
5. To specify the text height, either press Enter to accept the default
height, or type a new value for the text height and then press Enter.

Book III
Chapter 1
Text: When Pictures
Just Won’t Do
Creating Single Line Text
251
You see the Specify height prompt only if your current text style is
defined with a height of 0 (the default Standard text style is so defined).
You can accept the default or enter a new text height here.
After you entered the desired text height, the following prompt is 
displayed:
Specify rotation angle of text <0>:
6. To specify the rotation angle, press Enter to accept the default value,
or enter a new rotation angle.
Rotation angle refers to the angle of the whole text string, not to the
slant of the individual characters, which is called the obliquing angle
(see Figure 1-5). For horizontal text, leave the rotation angle at 0 degrees.
Rotation angle is set when you’re placing single-line or multiline text;
obliquing angle is part of the text style definition.
After a whole lot of prompting, you’re finally ready to start adding text to
the drawing! The crosshairs change to a text box to let you know that
AutoCAD is indeed ready for some text.
7. Type your text.
When you want to break a line and continue on the next line, press Enter
and continue typing. As you enter text, you can change the settings used
for the in-place text editor, insert fields, perform find and replace opera-
tions, and much more by right-clicking. To find out about these addi-
tional features, press F1 while the in-place text editor is displayed. I
cover working with fields, spell checking, and finding and replacing text
later in this chapter.
8. When you finish adding single-line text, press Enter on a blank line to
return to the command line.

Working with Multiline Text

Working with Multiline Text
As if single-line text wasn’t bad enough, multiline text introduces even more
levels of complexity! Many longtime users were slow to adopt multiline text
because of the complexities, and really, you can get most annotation jobs
done with single-line text. So why bother?
A few tasks that you need to do every so often are extremely difficult to
achieve with single-line text. I’ve already talked about word wrap in multiline
text, which lets you shift the space required by a block of notes by simply
grabbing the grips of the text object and dragging them to a new location.
Nicely aligned numbered or bulleted lists are hard to create by using single-
line text because proportionally spaced fonts (and nearly all AutoCAD fonts
are proportionally spaced) make lining things up virtually impossible.
Creating columns of text is also difficult with single-line text but can be
accomplished with just a few clicks with multiline text.
Finally, a font’s full character set (that is, nonalphanumeric symbols) is read-
ily accessible in multiline text. Single-line text offers just a few special char-
acters that you have to enter with special codes.
I hope the advantages of multiline text encourage you to hang in there with
it. The final bit of advice is this: If you master only one kind of text in
AutoCAD, make it multiline text!
You create both single-line and multiline text in an in-place text editor. In-
place means that the text you create in the editor will appear in the drawing
in exactly that place at exactly that size when you finish creating the text
and close the editor as long as you’re not zoomed out to a point where you
may not be able to visually read the text. If you’re zoomed out too far, the
text in the in-place editor will not appear at the actual size that it will be
inserted into the drawing.
For single-line text, the in-place editor is simply a Windows-style text box.
For multiline text, the in-place editor is more elaborate, consisting of two
components: the in-place text editor (see Figure 1-6) and either the Multiline
Text tab on the ribbon or the Text Formatting toolbar (which is displayed
only when the ribbon is not shown).
When creating a multiline text object, you can control the formatting of the
text for the object in the following ways:
✦Multiline Text ribbon panel: The ribbon panel contains a multitude of
drop-down lists and buttons that would do a word processor proud. Set
justification, color, or style; add symbols or fields; and fine-tune charac-
ter or line spacing.

Book III
Chapter 1
Text: When Pictures

Creating Multiline Text
253
✦Text Formatting toolbar: The toolbar contains the same plethora of
drop-down lists and buttons that are on the Multiline Text ribbon panel.
The Text Formatting toolbar is displayed only when the ribbon is not
displayed or the MTEXTTOOLBAR system variable is set to a value of 1.
✦Bounding box with ruler: The text you type appears in the bounding
box. You can set margin and tab stops in the ruler by dragging the point-
ers, just like in a word processor. If you don’t see a ruler atop the bound-
ing box: On the ribbon or the top row of the Text Formatting toolbar,
click Options panel➪Ruler .
Creating Multiline Text
The following steps show you how to add a multiline text object to a drawing:
1. On the ribbon, click Annotate tab➪Text panel➪Multiline Line Text (or
on the menu browser or menu bar, click Draw menu➪Text➪Multiline
Text).
The standard crosshairs change to plain crosshairs and ghosted text in
the current style and height. The current text style name, height, and
whether the text style is annotative are displayed in the command line.
The command displays the following prompt:
Current text style:  “MyNewStandard”  Text height:
2.6654  Annotative: No
Specify first corner:
Figure 1-6:
The
multiline
text editor.

Creating Multiline Text
254
You can control the ghosted text that is displayed when you first 
start the MTEXT command by changing the text string of the 
MTEXTJIGSTRING system variable. Type MTEXTJIGSTRING at the 
command prompt and type the text string you want to display with a
maximum of 10 characters. Then press Enter to accept the new text
string.
2. Pick the first corner of the bounding box.
The default multiline text justification is Top Left, so the first point you
pick will be the upper-left corner of the text object. The following
prompt is then displayed at the command line:
Specify opposite corner or [Height/Justify/Line
spacing/Rotation/Style/Width/Columns]:
3. Enter a command option or pick the second corner.
Enter the uppercase letter of the option to change text height, justifica-
tion, line spacing, rotation, style, or the overall width of the text box. To
retain all the default settings, pick the opposite corner of the text box.
The command prompt disappears, and the in-place text editor is dis-
played with the bounding box. If the ribbon is displayed, the contextual
Multiline Text panel is displayed. If the ribbon is not displayed, the Text
Formatting toolbar is displayed.
The bounding box sets only the width of the multiline text object. It does
not control the object’s height — it will expand as necessary to include
all the text you enter.
4. Type your text.
The text you type flows across the bounding box. When the text reaches
the opposite side, it wraps automatically to the next line, just like your
favorite word processor.
5. To indicate that you have finished entering text, click outside the in-
place editor.
The in-place text editor closes. You can also press Ctrl+Enter or click
Close Text Editor on the ribbon or Text Formatting toolbar.
Formatting options
The various panels on the ribbon’s Multiline Text tab (refer to Figure 1-6)
and the Text Formatting toolbar enable you to perform many of the func-
tions of a full-featured word processor. You can change the style, font,
height, and any number of other properties of your multiline text object. See
the online Help system for a full description of each formatting option —
while the in-place text editor is displayed, press F1. The online Help system
opens to the In-Place Text Editor topic.

Creating Multiline Text
255
A multiline text object can be created using only one text style. If you type
some text, change the style, and type some more, the entire multiline text
object changes to the new style. You can get the effect of different styles by
highlighting some text and changing the font, height, color, and so on.
Numbered and bulleted lists
Another advantage of multiline text is that it supports bulleted and num-
bered lists. This feature is especially useful for creating general drawing
notes, as shown in Figure 1-7.
AutoCAD automates the process of creating numbered lists almost com-
pletely. Here’s how:
1. Follow Steps 1 through 3 in the previous section, “Creating Multiline
Text.”
2. Type a title; for example, GENERAL NOTES.
If you want your title underlined, click Underline on the Formatting
panel in the Multiline Text tab on the ribbon or Text Formatting toolbar
before you type the title, and then click Underline again to turn it off.
3. Press Enter to go to the next line.
Press Enter again if you want to leave a little more space between the
title and the body of the text.
4. Right-click inside the in-place text editor and choose Bullets and
Lists➪Numbered. Also select Allow Auto-List, Use Tab Delimiter Only,
and Allow Bullets and Lists if they are not already selected.
Figure 1-7:
Tabs,
indents, and

lists.

Creating Multiline Text
256
The number 1 followed by a period appears on the current line, and the
cursor jumps to the tab stop visible in the ruler at the top of the in-place
text editor’s ruler.
Numbered places numerals followed by periods in front of items in a list.
Lettered places uppercase or lowercase letters followed by periods in
front of list items. (Bulleted places bullet characters in front of list
items.) Auto-list enables automatic numbering — each time you press
Enter to move to a new line, the number of the bulleted list increments
by one. Use Tab Delimiter Only means you must press the Tab key to
move to the tab stop.
5. Type the text corresponding to the current number or bullet.
As AutoCAD wraps the text, the second and subsequent lines align with
the tab stop — that is, the text is automatically indented.
6. To move to the next line, press Enter at the end of the paragraph.
Just like creating numbered lists in a word processor, AutoCAD automat-
ically inserts the next number at the beginning of the new paragraph,
with everything perfectly aligned (refer to Figure 1-7).
7. Type the text corresponding to the next number or bullet, and then
press Enter at the end of the paragraph to move to the next line.
8. Repeat Steps 5 through 7 for each subsequent numbered or bulleted
item.
9. When you finish creating the numbered list, press Enter and then
right-click in the in-place text editor. Choose Bullets and Lists➪Off.
10. Enter any additional text. Then click outside the in-place editor.
Controlling the flow of text
When you create a multiline text object, you can control the width of the
object but not its height. The object’s width affects how and when the text
flows, or wraps, automatically. In addition, you can use columns to control
the flow of the text (refer to Figure 1-7). Multiline text objects support static
and dynamic columns.
When you define the behavior of columns for a multiline text object, you can
specify the number of columns, the height for the columns, the width for
each column, the gutter width, and the overall total width of the multiline
text object. Text automatically flows between the columns based on the
dimensions specified or when you insert a column break. You set the column
settings by right-clicking in the in-place editor and choosing Columns➪
Columns Settings. Make the desired column settings in the Column Settings
dialog box and click OK. You can also adjust the width, gutter, and height for
columns by using the controls on the ruler and outside the boundary box of
the in-place text editor.

Fields, masks, and other multiline text delights
I haven’t exhausted the features of the multiline text editor yet, and two
especially useful ones are fields and background masks. The in-place text
editor also offers a panoply of little functions and utilities that come in
handy from time to time.
The convention in drafting is that text in a drawing is uppercase at all times.
One way to avoid having to keep the Shift key pressed down is to use the
Caps Lock key. But when you finish typing text and want to log into your net-
work, if you forget to turn off Caps Lock, you get an error message. The in-
place text editor has a great solution for you. Right-click the in-place text
editor and choose AutoCAPS. Everything you type in the in-place text editor
when creating multiline text will be in uppercase, without using Caps Lock. If
you do forget and start typing text only to find out that you entered the text
in lowercase, do not reach for the Backspace key. Instead highlight the text,
right-click, and choose Change Case➪UPPERCASE. The highlighted text is
now all in uppercase.
Fields
Fields are placeholders for changeable data that updates automatically —
such as the author of a drawing and when it was created, last saved, or plot-
ted. This data comes from drawing properties, objects in a drawing, system
variables, or a sheet set (sheet sets are not available in AutoCAD LT). To dis-
play the Field dialog box, right-click in the in-place text editor and choose
Insert Field. Fields can also be inserted into single-line text objects. For more
information on inserting and updating fields, refer to the online Help system.
Background masks
Sometimes you just have to place a note on top of drawing objects, and
invariably, it looks bad. If you use multiline text for your note, you can mask
the background drawing data so that the text displays clearly. Follow these
steps:
1. In a drawing containing some graphic objects, add some multiline text
on top of the drawn objects.
2. Right-click inside the in-place text editor and choose Background
Mask.
The Background Mask dialog box appears.
3. Select Use Background Mask.
The remaining dialog box options become accessible.
4. Set a Border Offset factor.

Editing Text
258
This value, which must be between 1 and 5, controls the distance
beyond the text object that the mask extends. When set to 1, the mask is
tight to the text object.
5. In the Fill Color area, either select Use Drawing Background Color or
click the drop-down list to select a color for the mask.
If you don’t want bright red rectangles all over your drawing, make sure
you select the Use Drawing Background color box.
6. Click OK and then exit the in-place text editor (see Figure 1-8).
Editing Text
After you’ve created either single-line or multiline text, editing it is a straight-
forward exercise. As you might expect, there are two editors for the two
types of text. So how do you know which editor to use? Easy — AutoCAD
chooses for you if you double-click the text.
Editing single-line text
I’ve already pointed out all the formatting options available for multiline
text, and if those are what you need, it’s multiline text for you. Your editing
options are fewer with single-line text, but for simple text, they should be
more than ample.
Both types of text use an in-place text editor, where the text appears inside
an edit box at the size and location it appears in the drawing. Simply double-
click a string of single-line text to display it in the in-place editor. All you can
change here is the value of the text itself. If you need to change other proper-
ties such as style, justification, or height, select the text and make changes
in the Properties palette.

If you’re an old hand at AutoCAD and you absolutely can’t function with the
in-place text editor for new single-line text, you can restore the pre-AutoCAD
2006 Edit Text dialog box by setting the DTEXTED system variable to 1.
Editing multiline text
Double-clicking a multiline text object also opens its in-place editor, but as
you’ve already seen, it’s an editor with a lot more bells and whistles. I cover
most of the options in the earlier sections on creating multiline text. To
change all or parts of the text, select as you would in a word processor and
apply your changes. Then click outside the in-place editor to indicate that
you’ve finished editing the text.
Single-line text isn’t allowed to have anything that paragraph text doesn’t
also have, so an MTEXTED system variable lets you revert to the previous
editor. To do so, type MTEXTED and press Enter; then type OldEditor and
press Enter. The old editor still has the same toolbar and ruler, but the
bounding box doesn’t display the selected text at its actual size or location.
Fiddling with text can be a tedious task, and lots of little-known commands
and functions let you do your tweaking more efficiently. Two such com-
mands let you adjust text height and justification in different ways:
✦SCALETEXT: Suppose you have a whole bunch of annotation objects in
your drawing, and you want to reduce the size of them all. The SCALE
command requires a lot of selecting and moving, but SCALETEXT scales
each text object about its own insertion point, so the text stays where it
ought to.
✦JUSTIFYTEXT: If you change the justification of text in the Properties
palette or the in-place text editor, the insertion point stays put and the
text moves. JUSTIFYTEXT lets you change the justification by keeping
the position of the text where it is and moving the insertion point.
Turning the Tables
Table objects were introduced in AutoCAD 2005. Before then, if you needed
to add a table — say a bill of materials, or a door schedule, or a drawing 
list — you were in for some work; drawing lines, adding text, moving lines,
and aligning everything at the end. AutoCAD’s tables can start at the top and
flow downward, as they do in most of the examples mentioned. They can
also be anchored at the bottom and flow upward, which is the typical fash-
ion for things like revision blocks. Tables can contain regular text, blocks, or
fields.

Turning the Tables
260
Setting the table with styles
Tables, like text and dimensions, are defined according to styles. Every draw-
ing has at least one table style waiting to be called on. The default templates
contain a table style called (what else?) Standard, which also references the
Standard text style. The following steps explain how to create a table style:
1. On the ribbon, click Annotate tab➪Tables panel➪Table Style (or on
the menu browser or menu bar, click Format menu➪Table Style).
The Table Style dialog box appears, showing on the left a list of all table
styles defined in the current drawing, and on the right a preview of the
current style settings. You can select an existing table style to set it cur-
rent, to modify it, or to delete it; however, you can’t delete the Standard
style.
2. Click New to create a new table style.
The Create New Table Style dialog box appears.
3. Enter a name for the new style; for example, Door Schedule.
If you have more than one style defined, you can use the drop-down list
to select an existing table style as the prototype for the new style.
4. Click Continue.
The New Table Style dialog box opens, again with a preview of the current
settings — except they’re displayed on the left this time (see Figure 1-9).
Figure 1-9:
Setting the
table.

Chapter 1
Text: When Pictures

Turning the Tables
261
A table style has up to three parts: title, column headings, and data.
Each part of the table can be formatted with a cell style, and each part of
a table style has one default style. The settings for formatting a cell style
are on the three tabs to the right of the dialog box (General, Text, and
Border). When you insert a table, you have the ability to control which
cell style is applied to the title, column headings, or data of the table. In
other words, your table can contain the data only; the data and column
heads; the data and a table title; or the data, column heads, and a title.
5. In the Cell Styles area, select Data from the drop-down list. Change
the settings for the cell style by using the General, Text, and Border
tabs located below the Cell Styles drop-down list.
The Cell Style Preview updates as you change settings for the cell style.
If you need to, click the Create a New Cell Style button (under the Cell
Styles area and just to the left of the Cell Styles drop-down list along the
top of the dialog box) to add additional cell styles that you might want
to use. The Margins area on the General tab allows you to increase or
decrease the space between the table text and the lines. Cell styles can
also contain cell formatting, which allows you to represent values as cur-
rency or with a specific precision,
6. Repeat Step 5 for the Header and Title cell styles, or any of the other
cell styles in the drawing that you’ll be using to create a new table.
7. In the General area (on the left), specify whether the table direction
should be Down (the default) or Up.
8. Click OK to close the New Table Style dialog box.
You return to the Table Style dialog box. The new table style is automati-
cally set current.
Creating and editing tables
After the table style is created, you use the TABLE command to add a table
object to the drawing. The following steps show how:
1. On the ribbon, click Annotate tab➪Tables panel➪Table (or on the
menu browser or menu bar, click Draw menu➪Table).
The Insert Table dialog box appears (see Figure 1-10).
2. In the Table Style drop-down list, select a table style or click the
Launch the Table Style Dialog button located under the Cell Styles
area to create a new table style.
The Preview area displays a preview of a table with the current cell
styles that are set under the Set Cell Styles area.

Turning the Tables
262
3. In the Insertion Options area, select Start from Empty Table.
The Start from Empty Table option gives you a table with no data in it. If
you have a spreadsheet that contains values for your table, you can
choose the From a Data Link option instead, or you can use the From
Object Data in the Drawing (Data Extraction) option if you want to
create a table based on the properties of objects in the drawing along
with block attribute values. I cover working with Data Links in the “Link
me up Scotty” section later in this chapter. For information on using
object properties and attribute values to populate a table, look up the
DATAEXTRACTION command on the Index tab of AutoCAD’s online Help
system.
4. In the Insertion Behavior area, select Specify Insertion Point or
Specify Window.
Specify Insertion Point is the preferable option because it maintains the
height and width settings you set in the table and text styles. Choosing
Specify Window squeezes or stretches the table into the rectangular
area you define.
5. Specify the number of columns and data rows.
Data Rows excludes the rows for the title and column headings.
6. Adjust the column width and row height as required.
One or the other pair of these options is dimmed if you choose Specify
Window in Step 4. If you’re using a table style that was created by using
an existing table, you have the option to specify what values and format-
ting are applied to the new table in the Table Options area, which will be
displayed below the Column & Row Settings area.

7. Click OK.
The empty table is placed in the drawing. The Multiline Text panel is 
displayed on the ribbon (or the Text Formatting toolbar appears if the
ribbon is not displayed), and the first column cell is highlighted, ready
for text input.
8. Enter the table title, column headings, and data.
It’s now a matter of simply filling in the spaces. Imagine creating a table
like that with the TEXT and LINE commands! If you want to input the
text later, just click outside the highlighted cell.
You can use the Tab and arrow keys to navigate to cells in a table, and
use Alt+Enter to force a new line in a table cell.
9. Click outside the table to indicate that you have finished entering text.
To add table data, or to edit what’s already there, double-click inside the
table cell. You can format individual cells in a table by clicking the cell and
then changing its properties by using the Properties palette. You can also
manipulate the properties of all the cells in a row or column by clicking the
row or column on the Table Indicator that’s displayed along the top and left
side of the table.
Combine tables and fields to automatically populate a drawing title block or
revision block. Field data updates automatically when the data source
changes.
Table cells can also contain blocks, so you can create a drawing legend with
graphic symbols in one column and a description of what they stand for in
another column.
You can export the values in a table to a CSV file by using the TABLEEXPORT
command.
Link me up Scotty
As mentioned, you can create a new table in a drawing, or create a table
based on the properties of the objects and attributes of blocks in a drawing.
You can also link a spreadsheet to a drawing as a Data Link and then control
what sheets or cells from the spreadsheet are displayed in the table. You use
the DATALINK command to display Data Link Manager, which allows you to
link to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. By linking to a spreadsheet, you have
the ability to pull values from the spreadsheet into your drawing or push
values from AutoCAD to the spreadsheet after it is linked.

This bidirectional workflow makes it more natural to work with spreadsheets
than using OLE or performing a Paste Special to get the data into AutoCAD
and then the TABLEEXPORT command to get it back to the spreadsheet.
When you link to the spreadsheet, you have the option of AutoCAD retaining
the full and relative path to the spreadsheet file or none, which is important
when sharing drawings outside your company. After you link to the file, you
have the option to link to a sheet in the spreadsheet, a named range if one is
defined, or a range of cells. After the Data Link has been defined, you then
use the TABLE command to bring the values that you’re linking to in the
spreadsheet into AutoCAD.
In the Insert Table dialog box, you use the From a Data Link option in the
Insert Options area and then select one of the configured data links. The row
and column information is defined already for you based on how the data
link was set up. After the table is created, you will know that it’s defined by
using a data link because when it’s selected and the crosshairs hover over
the table, an icon of two chain links appear locked together. If a padlock icon
appears when you select a cell, it indicates that the contents, the format, or
both are locked. If you right-click and choose Locking, you can turn locking
on or off so the cell can be modified. If you make changes to the table, be
sure to update the spreadsheet if you want the changes reflected in the 
data source. You can also update the table in the drawing as well as from 
the data source. To update the data source or the table, you use the
DATALINKUPDATE command.
Finding Text and Spell Checking
As you work in a drawing and add more and more annotation, the chances of
finding a specific annotation object go down and the chances of making a
spelling mistake go up. The FIND command displays the Find and Replace
dialog box, which allows you to search for a text string in the entire drawing,
selected objects, or the current space (layout). Along with finding a text
string, you can also replace the matching text string if an instance of the text
string you’re searching for is found. The More Options button in the Find
and Replace dialog box gives you access to settings that determine how the
search for a text string is carried out and which annotation objects (single-
line text, dimensions, hyperlink, and others) will be searched for a text string
match. The in-place text editor used for single-line and multiline text offers
simplified find and replace options that are accessible by right-clicking the
in-place text editor and choosing Find and Replace.
Because to err is human but to misspell is unforgiving in this age of comput-
ers, AutoCAD helps you fix spelling mistakes through the use of the SPELL
command. The SPELL command displays the Check Spelling dialog box
which allows you to spell check the entire drawing, selected objects, or the

current space (layout). When AutoCAD encounters a spelling mistake, you’re
provided with a list of words that might be the correct spelling. You can also
enter a replacement value yourself. You can add words that your company
normally uses to the dictionary so AutoCAD understands that the word is
not misspelled each time you run the spell checker.
You can also access the spell checker in the in-place text editor when work-
ing with multiline text objects. If you misspell a word, the in-place editor lets
you know by underlining the misspelled word in red, which is similar to what
Microsoft Word does. To correct the misspelled word, right-click it to access
a list of suggested corrections (the list of corrections appears at the top of
the menu).

imensions are a form of annotation that provides information about
the size or angle of a part so you know how it should be manufactured
or constructed. Typically, dimensions provide information on the length of a
part, the diameter of a hole, callouts in the form of leaders, or the allowable
tolerances that a machined part can have before it might fail. In this chapter,
you find out how to create and work with dimensions, leaders, and geomet-
ric tolerances.
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT offer a number of dimension-related commands
to help convey your design ideas to the people who are doing the construc-
tion (in the case of a building) or manufacturing (in the case of a machine
part). Just as text styles manage the appearance of text in a drawing, dimen-
sion styles do the same thing for dimensions and multileader styles for mul-
tileaders. Dimension styles allow you to visually define how dimensions
appear in a drawing, but they are more complex than text styles. Multileader
styles control how a multileader is created, the type of annotation object
that is used for the content of the multileader, and how it visually looks in
the drawing. Both dimension styles and multileader styles also use text
styles to help format the way the text in the objects appear.
Understanding What a Dimension Is Made Of
Dimensions are made from lines, arcs, multiline text, single-line text, 2D solids,
points, and blocks. Hands down they’re one of the most complex objects in
AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT because of how they work and the many options
that are available to control how they appear in a drawing. Dimensions are
made up of several subobjects or components that define what the dimension

Understanding What a Dimension Is Made Of
268
looks like. Some of the subobjects that define a dimension are extension lines,
dimension lines, arrowheads, dimension text, and origin points.
Before you begin creating dimensions, you should understand some of the
common terminology that is used to call out the different parts of a dimen-
sion (see Figure 2-1). Although each dimension type has its purpose, they do
share some things in common.
Here are the five main parts of a dimension:
✦Origin point: An origin point defines the measurement value for the
dimension text and is a small nonprinting point attached to the dimen-
sion. Origin points are typically placed on an object and allow you to
move or reposition a dimension that may need to be updated.
✦Extension line: An extension line extends up to the dimension line and
arrowheads, and indicates which feature or points on an object are
being dimensioned. An extension line typically has a gap between it and
the origin point of the dimension object and extends past the dimension
line. The gap helps show that the dimension is not part of the object.
✦Arrowhead: An arrowhead appears at the end of a dimension line and
indicates where a dimension starts and ends. Arrowheads can be dis-
played as open or closed arrows, architectural ticks, dots, or user-
defined arrows, among other arrowhead styles.
✦Dimension line: A dimension line is typically displayed between the
extension lines and goes outward from the center of the dimension
object toward the extension line. Based on where the dimension text is
placed, the dimension line may appear broken or on the outside of the
extension lines.
✦Dimension text: Dimension text provides the value of measurement with
which the dimension was created and can be formatted in a variety of
ways. Some of the formatting options are the units of measurement, the
type of decimal separator that is used, and how the value should be
rounded. You can also override the dimension text with your own text
string or add additional notes to the dimension string.

Types of Dimensions
269
Each of the parts of a dimension can be formatted globally by using dimen-
sion styles or formatted individually by using dimension overrides. I talk
more about dimension styles and dimension overrides later in this chapter.
Types of Dimensions
Dimensions are a special type of block that AutoCAD treats differently from
the blocks that you can create and insert into drawings; I cover blocks later
in Chapter 1 of Book VI. Because dimensions are a special type of object, 
you interact with them differently. Dimensions can be created so that if the
object that was dimensioned is changed, the dimension is updated automati-
cally. Dimensions can also be created so that they are exploded after they
have been created (which is not recommended because you won’t be able to
quickly update the dimension when the geometry in the drawing changes).
They can also be created so that if the original object that is dimensioned is
modified, the dimension doesn’t update. No matter what type of dimension
you create, they all look the same, but you edit them in different ways.
Associative dimensions
Associative dimensions are created as a single object — so when you select
any part of the dimension, the entire dimension is selected. An associative
dimension is linked to the original object that was dimensioned, so when the
original object is modified, the dimension is updated accordingly. Modifying
the original dimensioned object by moving, rotating, stretching, or scaling it
will cause the dimension to be update automatically. Fully associated dimen-
sions were first introduced in AutoCAD 2002; before AutoCAD 2002, associ-
ated dimensions meant that the dimension was all one object and had no
association with the dimensioned object.
Nonassociative dimensions
Nonassociative dimensions, like associative dimensions, are created as a
single object. But unlike associative dimensions, nonassociative dimensions
are not linked to the original dimensioned object and therefore are not
updated when the original dimensioned object is modified. If you select both
the dimension and the original dimensioned object, you can update both
objects based on the modify command being used. Before AutoCAD 2002,
nonassociative dimensions were referred to as associative dimensions
because they were a single object instead of individual objects. You can use
the DIMREASSOCIATE command to change nonassociative dimensions into
associative dimensions. See the “Associating dimensions” section later in
this chapter for more information.

Creating New Dimensions as Associative
270
Exploded dimensions
An exploded dimension looks just like an associative or nonassociative
dimension except it’s made up of individual 2D objects and not just one
single object, which makes it hard to update. I recommend that you don’t
create exploded dimensions because it can lead to inaccuracies in the
dimension text. If you really need to create an exploded dimension, it is best
to create an associative dimension and then use the EXPLODE command on
the dimension.
Creating New Dimensions as Associative
To specify whether new dimensions are created as associative or non-
associative, you can select or deselect the Make New Dimensions Associative
option in the Associative Dimensioning section on the User Preferences tab
(see Figure 2-2).
Follow these steps to determine whether new dimensions should be created
as associative or nonassociative.
1. Right-click the drawing window and choose Options.
2. In the Options dialog box, click the User Preferences tab.
3. In the Associative Dimensioning section, select or deselect the Make
New Dimensions Associative option.
If you select the option, all new dimensions are created as associative.
The setting to create new dimensions as associative is saved in the
drawing. When you get a drawing from a vendor or client, be sure that
the setting is set to create new dimensions as associative.
4. Click OK.
The change is saved and the Options dialog box is closed.

271
As you can see from the Options dialog box, even Autodesk tries to discour-
age you from creating exploded dimensions. However, if you need to create
new dimensions as exploded dimensions, you can set the DIMASSOC system
variable to a value of 0. Setting DIMASSOC to a value of 1 creates nonassocia-
tive dimensions and a value of 2 (the default value) creates associative
dimensions.
Using and Creating Dimension Styles
Dimensions contain a large number of display options. Both AutoCAD and
AutoCAD LT use dimension styles to contain groups of settings that control
the appearance of dimensions. Dimension styles tell AutoCAD and AutoCAD
LT how the dimension and extensions lines, dimension text, and arrowheads
should be displayed for any dimension created in a drawing. When a dimen-
sion style is updated, all dimensions referencing that dimension are updated,
unless you have applied an override at the dimension object level.
Working with Dimension Style Manager
Dimension styles are stored in a drawing file and are referenced by every
dimension created in the drawing. Each dimension that’s created can refer-
ence a different dimension style, but it always references a dimension. You
create, modify, and manage dimension styles through the Dimension Style
Manager dialog box (see Figure 2-3), which is displayed with the DIMSTYLE
command.
Figure 2-3:
The
Dimension
Style
Manager
dialog box.

Using and Creating Dimension Styles
272
To start the DIMSTYLE command and display the Dimension Style Manager
dialog box, do one of the following:
✦On the ribbon, click Annotate tab➪Dimensions panel➪Dimension Style.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Format or Dimension menu➪
Dimension Style.
✦On the Styles or Dimension toolbar, click the Dimension Style button.
✦At the command prompt, type DIMSTYLE or D and press Enter.
Creating a dimension style
Dimension styles can only be created from a style that already exists in 
the drawing; by default, each drawing contains a dimension style called
Standard (imperial units) or ISO-25 (metric units). Dimension Style Manager
is used to create the new dimension style and then allows you to make any
necessary property changes to the style. The following steps create a new
dimension style:
1. Start the DIMSTYLE command by using one of the preceding methods.
The Dimension Style Manager dialog box (refer to Figure 2-3) is displayed.
2. Click New.
The Create New Dimension Style dialog box (see Figure 2-4) is displayed.
3. In the New Style Name text box, enter a name for the dimension style
that you’re creating.
The name entered is used to set the dimension style current when you
want to create new dimensions using that dimension style.
4. In the Start With drop-down list, select the dimension style on which
you want to base the new dimension style.
The dimension style on which you base the new dimension style will be
identical to the one you’re creating until you make changes to the new
dimension style.

5. (Optional) Select the Annotative option.
This tells AutoCAD that the dimension style supports annotation scal-
ing. If you choose to not select the option now, you can select the
Annotative option on the Fit tab of the New Dimension Style or Modify
Dimension Style dialog box later. I cover working with annotation scaling
in Chapter 4 of this minibook.
6. In the Use For drop-down list, select All Dimensions.
This drop-down list allows you to create substyles for a dimension style.
Substyles allow you to define specific characteristics for certain types 
of dimensions that can be created by using a single dimension style.
Substyles are used when the parent dimension style is used.
7. Click Continue.
The New Dimension Style dialog box is displayed so you can change the
settings of the new dimension style.
8. Adjust the properties of the dimension style or the substyle as 
necessary.
9. Click OK.
The New Dimension Style dialog box closes and the dimension style 
is saved in the drawing. You return to the Dimension Style Manager
dialog box.
10. Click Close.
The Dimension Style Manager dialog box closes.
Stylizing dimensions
The New Dimension Style dialog box allows you to define how dimensions in
a drawing look when they’re created. The New Dimension Style dialog box is
divided into seven tabs, which help to organize the properties of a dimen-
sion style by characteristics. As you change the properties for the dimension
style, the preview of the dimension style in the upper-right corner of the
dialog box is updated.
The Lines tab
The Lines tab (see Figure 2-5) allows you to define the display of dimension
and extension lines. On the Lines tab, you can specify the color, the linetype,
the lineweight, which extension and dimension lines are suppressed, and
some spacing/offset values that help to define what a dimension should look
like when assigned the dimension style.

Using and Creating Dimension Styles
274
The Symbols and Arrows tab
The Symbols and Arrows tab (see Figure 2-6) allows you to define the char-
acteristics of the terminators and symbols for dimensions. On the Symbols
and Arrows tab, you can specify the type of arrowheads that are used, how
center marks are drawn, the symbol that should be used for arc length
dimensions, the jog angle for jogged radial dimensions, the height of the jog
for linear jogged dimensions, and the size of the break when you break
dimensions based on the geometry that passes through them.

The Text tab
The Text tab (see Figure 2-7) allows you to define how dimension text is
placed along the dimension line and how it appears. On the Text tab, you
can specify the color, text style, background fill color, and height, as well as
some other properties that affect how text is created, placed, and aligned
with the dimension line.
If you assign a text style that has a specified text height to a dimension style,
the text height specified on the Text tab is overridden by the value specified
in the text style. For the best control, use a height of 0 when defining a text
style.
The Fit tab
The Fit tab (see Figure 2-8) allows you to define how dimension text and
arrowheads are placed between extension lines. You can specify how dimen-
sion text and arrowheads are placed in relation to the amount of space
between the extension lines; the scale of dimension text in model space and
on a layout tab, and whether the dimension style is annotative; whether
dimension text is placed with a leader; and whether a dimension line should
be drawn between the extension lines.

The Primary Units tab
The Primary Units tab (see Figure 2-9) allows you to define how the measure-
ment value displayed in the dimension text should be formatted. On the
Primary Units tab, you can specify how dimension text is formatted, includ-
ing decimal separators, rounding factor, measurement units, prefix and suffix
for the dimension text, measurement scale factor, and how leading and trail-
ing zeros are displayed. The settings affect linear, radial, and angular meas-
urement values for dimensions.

277
The Alternate Units tab
The Alternate Units tab (see Figure 2-10) allows you to define how alternate
measurements appear as part of the dimension text. You can control
whether an alternate measurement value is placed with the primary meas-
urement value. Typically, alternate units are used when you want to display
dimensions with both imperial and metric values. The Alternate Units tab
contains options that are used for the formatting of the alternate measure-
ment text and its placement.
The Tolerances tab
The Tolerances tab (see Figure 2-11) allows you to define how tolerances
appear as part of the dimension text. Dimension text tolerances are much
different from the geometric tolerance object, which I talk about later in this
chapter. On the Tolerances tab, you specify the type of tolerance that’s dis-
played with the dimension text; the format of the tolerance, including preci-
sion, upper limits, and lower limits; and how leading and trailing zeros are
suppressed. The settings affect linear, radial, and angular measurement
values for dimensions.
Defining the scale for dimensions
You have to determine the appropriate scale for a dimension style, similar to
what you do with text objects. However, instead of using the same method to
calculate the height of text you follow a slightly different process that varies
slightly depending on whether you’re plotting from the Model tab or a paper
space layout.
Figure 2-10:
The
Alternate
Units tab of
the new
Dimension
Style dialog
box.

Using and Creating Dimension Styles
278
When plotting from the Model tab, you normally follow this formula when
creating multiline or single-line text unless you’re using annotation scaling,
which I explain in Chapter 4 of this minibook:
plot scale factor * desired text height when plotted = text height to use
To calculate the scale for dimensions, you use the formula
plot scale factor * desired text height when plotted = final text height
But instead of using the resulting value, which is final text height, you use
the plot scale factor as the dimension scale factor and the desired text
height as the text height for the dimension style.
To set the dimension scale for a dimension style, you display the dimension
style in the Modify Dimension Style dialog box, and then click the Fit tab. In
the Scale for Dimension Features area, uncheck Annotative if it is checked
and select Use Overall Scale. Then enter the plot scale for the drawing in the
text box to the left of Use Overall Scale. The desired height for text when
plotted is entered into the Text Height text box on the Text tab.
When plotting from a paper space layout, you just set the Text Height 
option on the Text tab to the desired height when plotted and select Scale
Dimensions to Layout in the Scale for Dimension Features area on the Fit tab.
Really what you are doing is setting a dimension scale that allows AutoCAD
to control the scale as needed for the dimensions. Annotation scaling,
although it requires some effort to set up, simplifies the scaling process for
text and dimensions, among other annotation objects in AutoCAD.

Dimension variables
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT hide many of their complex workings in the latest
releases. In earlier releases of AutoCAD, when dimensions were introduced,
you had to know a lot of system variables specific to dimension styles. Even
to this day, you can still access the system variables specific to the current
dimension style and make changes to them through script files to set up a
dimension style. By changing the values of the dimension system variables
in this way, you create an override for the current dimension style that’s
applied to each new dimension created in the drawing — unless you use 
the –DIMSTYLE command with its Save option.
You can get a list of the dimension system variables by doing the following:
1. At the command prompt, enter SETVAR and press Enter.
The following prompt is displayed:
Enter variable name or [?]:
2. At the prompt, type ? and press Enter.
The following prompt is displayed:
Enter variable(s) to list <*>:
3. At the prompt, type DIM* and press Enter.
The system variables specific to the current dimension style are dis-
played in the AutoCAD Text window (or AutoCAD LT Text window if
you’re using AutoCAD LT).
4. Press Enter to continue listing additional system variables that are
related to the current dimension style.
5. Press ESC to end the SETVAR command, and then type the name of
the dimension system variable at the command prompt.
You’re prompted for the new value.
6. Enter the new value and press Enter.
The value is updated accordingly.
By changing the value of a system variable, you’re invoking a dimension style
override for the current dimension style. To save the changes to the current
dimension style, type –DIMSTYLE at the command prompt and press Enter.
At the Enter a Dimension Style Option prompt, type S and press Enter. Then
when prompted for the name of the dimension style, enter the name of the
current dimension style and press Enter. Because the style is being redefined,
when prompted to redefine the style, type Y and press Enter.

Using and Creating Dimension Styles
280
If you need help with what values you can use with a system variable, enter
the name of the system variable and press Enter. When the system variable
is prompting you for a new value, press F1 and the online Help for that
system variable opens. This also works well for commands that are in
progress and other system variables.
Setting a dimension style current
Dimension styles need to be set current to be assigned to a new dimension
when it’s created. AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT allow you to set a dimension
style current in several ways. The most common ways of setting a dimension
style current follow:
✦On the ribbon, click Annotate tab➪Dimensions panel➪Dimension Styles
drop-down list and then select the dimension style.
✦On the Styles or Dimension toolbar, click the Dimension Styles drop-
down list and select the dimension style.
✦In the Dimension Style Manager dialog box, double-click the dimension
style in the Styles list box, or select the dimension style in the Styles list
box and click Set Current.
Modifying a dimension style
At times, you may find that a dimension style needs to be updated. This
could be due to changes to the current CAD standards that your company
uses or even requirements that dimensions be provided with specific arrow-
heads or formatting for a client. You’re already familiar with creating a
dimension style, so you’ll find that modifying one is not that much different.
Dimension styles are modified through the Dimension Style Manager dialog
box. In the Styles list box, select the dimension style that you want to change
and click Modify. The Modify Dimension Style dialog box is displayed, which
is identical to the New Dimension Style dialog box. Make the desired changes
and then click OK to save the changes to the dimension style and to close
the Modify Dimension Style dialog box. Any dimensions using the modified
style are automatically updated to reflect the changes.
Dimension style overrides
Dimension style overrides allow you to make property changes to the cur-
rent dimension style without creating a new dimension style. Style overrides
can cause some confusion in a drawing when creating new dimensions,
though, unless you know that a style override is currently in use. To create a
style override, you change one of the dimension style variables, or click the

Book III
Chapter 2
Dimensioning
Using and Creating Dimension Styles
281
Override button in the Dimension Style Manager dialog box and make the
property changes that you want to be part of the style override.
Only new dimensions that are created with the style override current take on
the values of the changed properties. So you can draw dimensions using dif-
ferent text fit options, for example, to better accommodate the placement of
dimension text for some of the dimensions in a drawing. Overrides are best
done at the individual dimension object level by using the Properties palette
so that you don’t accidentally create more dimensions than you need with
the specific overrides in place. Selecting a dimension in a drawing allows 
you to override any property of a dimension object through the Properties
palette (see Figure 2-12). This makes it easier to get the correct override that
you want to use instead of setting it through the Dimension Style Manager
dialog box.
Dimension style overrides can be merged into the parent dimension style
from which the override was created by right-clicking the <Style Overrides>
text in the Dimension Style Manager dialog box and choosing Save to
Current Style. Only one dimension style override can exist in a drawing at a
time, and switching to another dimension style discards the style overrides
unless they are saved to the dimension style.

Using and Creating Dimension Styles
282
Dimension substyles
Dimension substyles are different from editing dimension styles and style
overrides because the substyle limits which properties you can edit based
on the substyle that’s created. Dimension substyles are created just like a
new dimension style, except you select one of the dimension types in the
Use For drop-down list in the Create New Dimension Style dialog box, and
you don’t need to specify a name for the dimension style. To modify a dimen-
sion substyle, select the substyle below the dimension style that the sub-
style is part of and click the Modify button.
Renaming a dimension style
A dimension style can be renamed by using the Dimension Style Manager or
Rename dialog box (on the ribbon, click Tools tab➪Drawing Utilities control
panel➪Rename), but style overrides and substyles can’t be. To rename a
dimension style by using the Dimension Style Manager dialog box, select the
dimension style in the Styles list box and press F2. The in-place editor appears
and allows you to change the dimension style’s name. You can also right-click
the dimension style you want to rename and choose Rename to display the 
in-place editor and enter a new name. To rename a dimension style in the
Rename dialog box, start the RENAME command and select Dimension Styles
from the Named Objects list. In the Items list, select the dimension style you
want to rename. Then in the Rename To box, enter the new name for the
Dimension style and click the Rename To button. Click the OK button after 
you finish renaming dimension styles or other named objects.
Deleting a dimension style
Dimension styles, substyles, and style overrides can be deleted from a draw-
ing through the Dimension Style Manager dialog box when they are not being
used. To delete a dimension style, a substyle, or style override, right-click the
dimension style in the Styles list box and choose Delete. When the AutoCAD
or AutoCAD LT message is displayed, click Yes to confirm the deletion.
The PURGE command can also be used to remove any unused dimension
styles from a drawing. For more information on purging dimension styles
and other named objects from a drawing, see Chapter 5 of Book VI.

Comparing dimension styles
You can compare two dimension styles to see what properties are different
between them. To compare two dimension styles, display the Dimension
Style Manager dialog box and click Compare to display the Compare
Dimension Styles dialog box. In the Compare drop-down list, select a dimen-
sion style, substyle, or the current style override. Then in the With drop-
down list, select the dimension style, substyle, or the current style override.
The property differences between the two selected styles are displayed in
the list box in the lower portion of the dialog box. You can click the Copy to
Clipboard button to copy the list of differences to the Windows Clipboard so
they can be pasted into another Windows application. Click Close to return
to Dimension Style Manager.
Importing a dimension style
Dimension styles should be part of the drawing template that you use to
create new drawings with. At times, you may not want to place a dimension
style in the drawing template that you use, but that doesn’t mean you have 
to create the dimension style every time you need it either. You can use
DesignCenter to drag and drop dimension styles from one drawing to another.
For more information on using DesignCenter, see Chapter 4 of Book VI.
Creating Dimensions
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT allow you to create many types of dimensions to
communicate overall design concepts: Dimensions are used to measure the
distance between two points, the radius or diameter of a curved object, the
location of a feature such as a hole, and more. The important thing to note
about dimensions is which ones you need and how to create them. This sec-
tion covers the different kinds of dimensions that you can create in AutoCAD
and AutoCAD LT. Table 2-1 lists the commands you use to create and modify
dimensions.

Linear and aligned dimensions
Linear dimensions are the most commonly used dimensions: They are used
to measure an object or two points horizontally or vertically in a drawing.
You can use linear dimensions to measure the distance between straight seg-
ments of lines or polylines, the chord length of an arc, or the diameter of a
circle, which can be created horizontally, vertically, or rotated (see Figure
2-13). Linear dimensions are created by using the DIMLINEAR command. To
start the DIMLINEAR command, refer to the methods outlined in Table 2-1.
Aligned dimensions are similar to linear dimensions except they are not cre-
ated orthogonally based on the origin points picked and they measure the
actual distance between the origin points picked, rather than the horizontal
or vertical distance. Aligned dimensions are created by using the DIMA-
LIGNED command, and its command prompts are nearly identical to the
DIMLINEAR command. To start the DIMALIGNED command, refer to the
methods outlined in Table 2-1.
The following steps create a linear dimension:
1. Start the DIMLINEAR command by using one of the methods in 
Table 2-1.
2. At the prompt, pick a point for the first origin point of the dimension
or press Enter to select an object to dimension.
If you select a point, the prompt Specify second extension line origin is
displayed. If you press Enter, the prompt Select object to dimension is 
displayed.
When specifying points for the origins of dimensions, use object snaps to
make sure that the dimensions are created with the correct measurement.
3. If the Specify second extension line origin prompt is displayed, pick a
point for the second origin point of the dimension. If the Select object
to dimension prompt is displayed, select an object to dimension in the
drawing.

4. At the prompt, pick a point to place the dimension or specify one of
the available options.
The dimension is placed and the command ends. The options Mtext,
Text, and Angle affect the value of the dimension text or how the dimen-
sion text is rotated. The options Horizontal, Vertical, and Rotated affect
how the dimension is created in the drawing and the measurement value
that is calculated.
You can add a jog line to a linear or aligned dimension that is used to indicate
the actual distance between the origin points in a dimension in a drawing
rather than the measured distance. This allows you to dimension very long
objects without actually showing the entire length of the object in the draw-
ing. To add or remove a jog line, you start the DIMJOGLINE command and
select a linear or aligned dimension. When a jog line is added to a dimension,
you can select the dimension and use grip editing to reposition the jog line.
To start the DIMJOGLINE dimension, use one of the methods in Table 2-1.
Baseline and continued dimensions
Baseline dimensions allow you to create a string of dimensions (see Figure
2-14) that continue from the first origin point of the previous linear, aligned,
angular, or ordinate dimension. Typically, you place the first dimension and
then follow it up by creating baseline dimensions, but you have the option of
creating baseline dimensions by selecting an existing dimension in a draw-
ing. Baseline dimensions are created by using the DIMBASELINE command.
To start the DIMBASELINE command, refer to the methods in Table 2-1.
Continued dimensions allow you to create a string of dimensions that con-
tinue from the second origin point of the previous linear, aligned, angular, or
ordinate dimension. As with baseline dimensions, you commonly place the
first dimension and then follow it up by creating the continued dimensions,
but you have the option of creating continued dimensions by selecting an
existing dimension in a drawing. Continued dimensions are created by using
Baseline dimensions

the DIMCONTINUE command, and its options are identical to the DIMBASE-
LINE command. To start the DIMCONTINUE command, refer to the methods
outlined in Table 2-1.
The following steps explain how to create a baseline dimension:
1. Start the DIMBASELINE command by using one of the methods in
Table 2-1.
The command line displays
Specify a second extension line origin or [Undo/Select]
<Select>:
2. At the prompt, pick a point for the second origin point of the dimen-
sion or press Enter to select a new base dimension.
The command line displays
Specify a second extension line origin or [Undo/Select]
<Select>:
If you press Enter once, the prompt Select base dimension is displayed,
which allows you to select a dimension to use as the base dimension for
creating more baseline dimensions.
Angular dimensions
Angular dimensions (see Figure 2-15) allow you to show the angular meas-
urement of objects in a drawing. The angular measurement might be based
on the endpoints of an arc, the angular relationship between two straight
segments, the center of a circle and another angle, or two vertexes that
define an angle. Angular dimensions are created by using the DIMANGLUAR
command. To start the DIMANGLUAR command, refer to the methods out-
lined in Table 2-1.
The following steps explain how to create an angular dimension based on
two lines:
1. Start the DIMANGULAR command by using one of the methods in
Table 2-1.
Figure 2-15:
Angular

Creating Dimensions
290
The command line displays
Select arc, circle, line, or <specify vertex>:
2. At the prompt, select a line segment.
The command line displays
Select second line:
3. At the prompt, select another line segment.
The command line displays
Specify dimension arc line location or
[Mtext/Text/Angle/Quadrant]:
4. At the prompt, pick a point to place the dimension or specify one of
the command’s options.
The dimension is placed and the command ends.
Arc length dimensions
Arc length dimensions (see Figure 2-16) are similar to angular dimensions,
except instead of measuring an angle, they measure the length of an arc or
an arc segment of a polyline. Based on how an arc needs to dimensioned,
you might use the arc length dimension over an angular or linear dimension.
Arc length dimensions are created by using the DIMARC command. To start
the DIMARC command, refer to the methods outlined in Table 2-1.
Radius, diameter, and jogged dimensions
AutoCAD offers four types of dimensions that are used to dimension the
radius or diameter of a circle or an arc, or place a center mark or center
lines at the center point of a circle or an arc. Figure 2-17 shows the results of
using the DIMRADIUS, DIMDIAMETER, DIMCENTER, and DIMJOGGED com-
mands on a circle or an arc.
Radius dimensions
Radius dimensions display an uppercase R prefixed to the measurement
value to designate that the measurement is for the radius and not the diame-
ter of an arc or a circle. When a radius dimension is placed, an optional
center mark is also displayed so you know the center of the object that is
Figure 2-16:
Arc length
dimensions.

Book III
Chapter 2

291
being dimensioned. Radius dimensions are created by using the DIMRADIUS
command. To start the DIMRADIUS command, refer to the methods outlined
in Table 2-1. After the DIMRADIUS command is started, select the arc or
circle to dimension and the point for the placement of the dimension text.
Diameter dimensions
Diameter dimensions are similar to radius dimensions except they’re used to
measure the diameter of an arc or a circle. The two dimensions look almost
identical, except the diameter dimension displays a diameter symbol in front
of the measurement value. Diameter dimensions are created by using the
DIMDIAMETER command. To start the DIMDIAMETER command, refer to the
methods in Table 2-1. After the DIMDIAMETER command starts, select the arc
or circle to dimension and the point for the placement of the dimension text.
Jogged dimensions
Like a radius dimension, a jogged dimension allows you to show the radius
of an arc or a circle, except instead of the dimension automatically indicating
the center of the object, you specify a different location in the drawing for
the center override location of the jogged dimension. When a jogged dimen-
sion is placed, zigzag lines are displayed on the dimension line to indicate
that the dimension is not being dimensioned from the center of the object.
Jogged dimensions are created by using the DIMJOGGED command. To start
the DIMJOGGED command, refer to the methods in Table 2-1. After the
DIMJOGGED command starts, select the arc or circle to dimension, the
center override location, the location of the dimension line, and then the
location of the jog.
Center marks
Center marks allow you to place a mark or set of lines at the center of an arc
or a circle. The lines that are created are not a single dimension object but a
bunch of separate line objects. The type of center mark created is based on
Radius dimension

the settings in the Center Mark area of the Symbols and Arrows tab in the
New/Modify Dimension Style dialog box. Center marks are automatically cre-
ated when you place radius and diameter dimensions, but you want to place
center marks at the center of circles when placing linear dimensions to indi-
cate that you are dimensioning to the center of the circle. Center marks are
created by using the DIMCENTER command. To start the DIMCENTER com-
mand, refer to the methods in Table 2-1. After the DIMCENTER command
starts, select an arc or a circle to create the center mark or center lines at
the center point of the selected arc or circle.
Ordinate dimensions
Ordinate dimensions (see Figure 2-18) allow you to place the x and y coordi-
nate value of a feature or specific point in a drawing. Each ordinate dimen-
sion represents either an x or a y value, but not both. Ordinate dimensions
are not a commonly used type of dimension, but you might find them on
shop drawings, which are used to manufacture parts. Ordinate dimensions
are created by using the DIMORDINATE command. To start the DIMORDI-
NATE command, refer to the methods in Table 2-1.
When you create ordinate dimensions, they are based on the origin of the
current user coordinate system (UCS). (For more information on the User
Coordinate System, see Chapter 2 of Book V.) Usually a point on an object in
the drawing is designated as 0,0. To do that, you need to specify a new origin
for the current UCS. To specify a new origin, start the UCS command and then
pick the point in the drawing that you want to set as the current 0,0 value. To
undo the moving of the origin, use the World option of the UCS command.
The Quick Dimension command
The Quick Dimension command allows you to quickly place a number of
dimensions in a drawing by selecting multiple objects. The QDIM command
allows you to create linear, continuous, staggered, baseline, ordinate, radius,
and diameter dimensions. The dimensions that the QDIM command creates
are identical to the dimension objects that you can create by using one of
Figure 2-18:
Ordinate
dimensions.

Book III
Chapter 2
Dimensioning
Editing Dimensions

the other related dimension commands, such as DIMLINEAR to create linear
dimensions or DIMBASELINE to create baseline dimensions. To start the
QDIM command, refer to the methods in Table 2-1.
The QDIM command is not available in AutoCAD LT.
Trans-spatial dimensions
Trans-spatial dimensions are not something you find in a science fiction
novel, but instead are a feature of AutoCAD that allows you to dimension
objects that are visible through a floating viewport and exist in model space.
Trans-spatial dimensions allow you to place on layouts dimensions that
accurately measure the objects they are dimensioning, but this brings up 
the question of where dimensions should be placed.
You should generally do dimensioning in model space (using the Model tab),
but at times, you may find it beneficial to dimension objects that are in model
space through a viewport. One of the benefits to dimensioning objects on a
paper space layout in releases of AutoCAD before AutoCAD 2008 was to avoid
having multiple dimensions and dimension styles so you could display
dimension text and arrowheads at the correct size based on the scale of the
viewport. Using different dimensions and dimension styles is no longer an
issue with the introduction of annotation scaling in AutoCAD 2008.
Although you can place dimensions on a paper space layout, it can lead to
some issues when trying to insert or reference a drawing into another draw-
ing. When inserting or referencing a drawing, only the objects on the Model
tab are brought in, resulting in lost or missing dimensions that might be cru-
cial to the design. If you still want to place dimensions on a paper space
layout, you must set the scale used for the dimension style to a value of 1.
Before you attempt to take on dimensioning on a paper space layout, I rec-
ommend that you stick to dimensioning in model space for a while.
Editing Dimensions
Dimensions are edited in slightly different ways, depending on what part of
the dimension object you want to edit. In this section, I explain some of the
common ways to edit dimensions.
Adding overrides to a dimension
At times, you may need to make adjustments to the location of an arrow-
head, change the position and formatting of text, or change the dimension
style of a dimension. The Properties palette allows you to override specific
properties of a dimension object that are also defined by the dimension style

Editing Dimensions
294
assigned to the dimension object. Along with using the Properties palette,
you can also select dimensions and right-click to access some of the com-
monly used dimension overrides. From the right-click shortcut menu, you
have the option to flip arrowheads individually so they are on the inside or
outside of an extension line, change the precision formatting of dimension
text, change the current dimension style for the dimension object, change
the position of the dimension text along the dimension line, or add or delete
annotation scales assigned to the dimension.
Editing the dimension text
Dimension text can be edited to add a prefix or suffix to a measurement
value to denote a typical dimension or quantity. You can edit the text of a
dimension by using the DDEDIT command, or change the Text Override, Dim
Prefix, and Dim Suffix properties with the Properties palette.
If you use the DDEDIT command, note that the measurement value is dis-
played with a background fill color. If the measurement text is not displayed
with a background fill color, a text override has been applied. To add the
true measurement value back into a dimension’s text, add the text <> to the
in-place text editor. The <> text string will be automatically resolved and the
actual dimension’s measured value will be displayed.
AutoCAD offers two commands that are specifically used for editing dimen-
sion text: DIMEDIT and DIMTEDIT. DIMEDIT allows you to change the dimen-
sion text displayed for a dimension, the placement of dimension text, and
the angle of the extension lines for the dimension. DIMTEDIT is used to move
and rotate dimension text. If you need additional help with these commands,
refer to AutoCAD’s online Help system.
Using grips to edit dimensions
Grips are one of the most powerful editing methods that AutoCAD offers,
and you can use them to edit dimensions. With grips, you can reposition
dimension text, change the placement of the dimension line along the exten-
sion lines, and move the origin points of a dimension. Moving the origin
points can cause the dimension to become nonassociative; however, you can
make the dimension associative again by using the DIMREASSOCIATE com-
mand, which I mention in the next section “Associating dimensions.” If you
use grips to stretch both the dimension and the object the dimension is
associated to, the dimension remains associative to the object.
Associating dimensions
Dimensions, at times, can wander off and disassociate themselves from the
original object to which they were dimensioned. Dimensions can become
disassociated through the use of the DIMDISASSOCIATE command, or a
dimension might break its associativity after being modified. If a dimension

Book III
Chapter 2
Dimensioning
Editing Dimensions
295
becomes disassociated, you can try counseling, or save yourself a visit to the
psychologist and use the DIMREASSOCIATE command. The DIMREASSOCIATE
command allows you to respecify the origin points of selected dimension
objects, making them once again associative to the objects in a drawing. The
DIMREASSOCIATE command can be used to convert pre-AutoCAD 2002
dimensions to fully associative dimensions.
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT do a pretty good job of watching for changes to
objects in a drawing, and making sure their associated dimensions are kept
up-to-date. If a dimension seems to be confused after you update an object,
you can kick-start it by using the DIMREGEN command. This forces the
dimension object to update if it’s still associative.
Breaking and spacing dimensions
Placing dimensions in a drawing can take some time to ensure that non-
dimension objects do not pass through the extension or dimension lines of
a dimension, or to equally space and align dimensions with other dimen-
sions in a drawing. The DIMBREAK and DIMSPACE commands help with
breaking, equally spacing, and aligning dimensions. The DIMBREAK com-
mand allows you to break extension and dimension lines based on where
objects intersect the dimension, without having to explode the dimension.
The DIMSPACE command allows you to equally space linear and aligned
dimensions without having to first erase the dimensions and then create
them again by using the DIMBASELINE command. You can also align linear,
aligned, and angular dimensions as long as you select dimensions of the
same type and use a spacing value of 0. Figure 2-19 shows dimensions before
and after using the DIMBREAK and DIMSPACE command. Notice that on the
image on the right, the breaks in the extension lines of the dimensions and
the dimensions have been equally spaced.
Inspecting dimensions
To help lower the costs of manufactured goods, companies have been
increasing their use of outside suppliers located all around the globe. When
working with new suppliers or even existing suppliers with new products,
you typically need to increase quality assurance checking. AutoCAD allows
you to add inspection symbols to a dimension.
Figure 2-19:
Those are
the breaks
and give
them some
space.

Leaders
296
An inspection symbol includes the dimension value and the rate at which the
dimension should be validated against the part produced off the assembly
line. As quality goes up, you might choose to reduce the rate at which the
part needs to be verified. Along with the dimension value and the rate for the
inspection, you can choose the shape of the frame for the inspection symbol
and add a label. Figure 2-20 shows an example of a linear dimension with an
inspection rate and label on the left side of the image. Inspection symbols are
added and removed from a dimension with the DIMINSPECT command, which
displays the Inspection Dimension dialog box (see Figure 2-20).
Leaders
Leaders are used to point to and call out a feature in a drawing. Figure 2-21
shows a couple of examples of leaders that can be created in AutoCAD. A
leader typically has an arrowhead at one end pointing to an object in the
drawing; the other end has text, an object, a block, or a tolerance object. 
The leader can contain any of the arrowheads that dimensions can, and the
leader line can contain as many straight or spline segments as you want.
AutoCAD allows you to create two types of leaders: multileaders and legacy
(or standard) leaders. Multileaders offer more flexibility, such as associative
annotation and support scaling. Legacy leaders do not support annotative
annotation, which means the leader and the text are separate objects.

Make way for multiple leaders
Starting with AutoCAD 2008, leaders were overhauled and now provide
better flexibility. The new type of leader object that was introduced with
AutoCAD 2008 was multileader. Multileaders work like dimensions in that
they get their display and behavior characteristics from styles and are asso-
ciative objects, which means that they know what they are pointing at in the
drawing. So if the object they are pointing at is modified, the leader remains
pointing to that same object after the object is modified (unless the object is
deleted). Multileaders, as the name suggests, can have more than one arrow
pointing at objects in a drawing, with a single annotation object or even mul-
tiple annotation objects.
Multileader styles
Multileader styles control the behavior of the MLEADER command and the
way a multileader object looks. You use the MLEADERSTYLE command to
display the Multileader Style Manager dialog box, which allows you to
create, modify, and manage all the multileader styles in a drawing. (The
Multileader Style Manager dialog box will remind you of the Dimension Style
Manager dialog box.) In the Multileader Style Manager dialog box, you click
New to create a new multileader style or select an existing style in the Styles
list and then click Modify.
After you create a new multileader style or modify an existing style, the
New/Modify Multileader Style dialog box (see Figure 2-22) is displayed.
Figure 2-22:

298
The New/Modify Multileader Style dialog box contains three tabs that control
the appearance of the multileader object, the type of annotation that is used
with the multileader style, and how the multileader should be created with
the MLEADER command. The three tabs of the dialog box are as follows:
✦Leader Format: Controls the general properties of the multileader object
such as type (straight, spline, or none), color, linetype and lineweight,
arrowhead style and size, and the break size when breaks are added to
the leaders of the multileader object.
✦Leader Structure: Controls how the multileader object is created with
the MLEADER command. You can control the maximum number of
points the multileader object can have, the angle for the first and second
segments, whether a landing is created and its size, and the scale of the
multileader object. Like dimension scale, the scale controls the size of
all the elements of the multileader object, and you can specify that the
multileader style supports annotation scaling.
✦Content: Controls the type of annotation that the multileader uses: mul-
tiline text, block, or none. Based on the type of annotation that will be
used, you specify the text properties for the multiline text, the block that
should be used, and how the annotation should be attached to the multi-
leader object when the annotation is to the left or right of the multi-
leader object.
To display the Multileader Style Manager dialog box, you use the MLEADER-
STYLE command. To start the MLEADERSTYLE command, do one of the 
following:
✦On the ribbon, click Annotate tab➪Multileaders panel➪Multileader
Style.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Format menu➪Multileader.
✦On the Multileader toolbar, click the Multileader Style button.
✦At the command prompt, type MLEADERSTYLE or MLS and press Enter.
Multileader styles need to be set current to be assigned to a new multileader
when it is created. AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT allow you to set a multileader
style current in several different ways. The most common ways of setting a
multileader style current follow:
✦On the ribbon, click Annotate tab➪Multileaders panel➪Multileader
Styles drop-down list.
✦On the Styles or Multileader toolbar, click the Multileader Styles drop-
down list.

Book III
Chapter 2

✦In the Multileader Style Manager dialog box, double-click the multileader
style in the Styles list box, or select the multileader style in the Styles
list box and click Set Current.
For information on each of the settings in the New/Modify Multileader Style
dialog box, refer to AutoCAD’s online Help system.
Multileaders
After you create a multileader style and set one current, you’re ready to
create the multileader object. How you create the multileader object
depends on the settings of the current multileader style. To create a multi-
leader, you use the MLEADER command. Multileaders typically are made up
of an arrowhead, straight or curved (spline) segments, a landing, and some
form of content. Figure 2-23 shows the different parts of a multileader.
Multileaders are created by using the MLEADER command. To start the
MLEADER command, do one of the following:
✦On the ribbon, click Annotate tab➪Multileaders panel➪Multileader.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Dimension menu➪Multileader.
✦On the Multileader toolbar, click the Multileader button.
✦At the command prompt, type MLEADER or MLD and press Enter.
The following procedure explains how to create a multileader object based
on two leader points, a landing, and a multileader style that uses Mtext for
its content:
1. Start the MLEADER command by using one of the methods in the pre-
ceding list.
The following prompt is displayed:
Specify leader arrowhead location or [leader Landing
first/Content first/options] <Options>:
Arrowhead
Landing
Leader segment

2. At the prompt, specify the point for the leader of the multileader
object in the drawing.
The following prompt is displayed:
Specify leader landing location:
3. At the prompt, specify the point in the drawing for the landing.
If the multileader style is designed to use Mtext for its annotation type,
the In-Place Text Editor is displayed. If the multileader style is not
designed to use Mtext but rather a block or no content, the block is
inserted near the end of the landing or the command just ends if no con-
tent is configured for the style.
4. Enter the designated text string and click outside the In-Place Text
Editor.
The Multileader object is placed and the command ends.
Modifying multileaders
Multileaders can be modified by using many of the common editing com-
mands, such as COPY, MOVE, and MIRROR. You can also use grips to edit the
placement of the text or block of the multileader, where the leaders on a mul-
tileader point to, and the location and length of the landing. You can also use
the DIMBREAK command with multileaders to add gaps to the segments and
landings of multileaders to avoid issues with the objects that made up the
design in your drawing. In addition to these commands, three additional
commands are specific to working with multileaders:
✦MLEADEREDIT: Adds and removes leaders from a multileader object. By
adding additional leaders, you can use one annotation object to point to
one or more features that need the same callout.
✦MLEADERALIGN: Aligns multileaders.
✦MLEADERCOLLECT: Combines multiple multileaders that contain
blocks into a group with a single leader.
For information on each of the multileader specific editing commands, refer
to AutoCAD’s online Help system.
Legacy leaders
Legacy leaders are the leader objects that you could create prior to
AutoCAD 2008 and still can create. If you’re still using the QLEADER com-
mand to create your leaders, you’re missing out on the benefits that multi-
leaders offer. If you’ve been out of the loop for a bit and happen to even be
using the legacy LEADER command, you want to make sure you jump

Book III

onboard with multileaders as soon as you can because they truly do make
editing and using leaders much easier.
I have to admit, though, if you are creating a simple AutoLISP routine or
script file, adding a leader to a drawing by using the LEADER command is
easier than using the MLEADER command. However, you may want to invest
some time in using the MLEADER command for your customizing and pro-
gramming needs because it will make the user of the customization or pro-
gram much happier. To find out more about the QLEADER and LEADER
commands, refer to AutoCAD’s online Help system.
I cover some of the basics of AutoLISP in Bonus Chapter 4, which you can
download from www.wiley.com/go.autocad2009aio.
Working with Geometric Tolerances
Geometric tolerances allow you to create a series of what are called feature
control frames. Feature control frames can contain symbols, tolerance values,
datum references, and projected tolerance zone values (see Figure 2-24).
Geometric tolerances are used for mechanical drawings and vary based on
the standards you need to follow, such as ANSI (American National Standards
Institute), ISO (International Standards Organization), or JIS (Japanese
Industrial Standards).
Geometric tolerances are created by using the TOLERANCE command. To
start the TOLERANCE command, follow one of these methods:
✦On the ribbon, click Annotate tab➪Dimensions panel➪Panel’s title
bar➪Tolerance.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Dimension menu➪Tolerance.
✦On the Dimension toolbar, click the Tolerance button.
✦At the command prompt, type TOLERANCE or TOL and press Enter.
When you start the TOLERANCE command, the Geometric Tolerance dialog
box (see Figure 2-25) is displayed.
Figure 2-24:
The
Geometric
tolerance.

Working with Geometric Tolerances
302
In the dialog box you can specify the tolerances, datum references, symbols,
and projected tolerance zone value you need reflected in the geometric tol-
erance. After you click OK, you are prompted for the insertion point of the
geometric tolerance object. You can modify geometric tolerances by using
grips, the DDEDIT command, and the common modifying commands. If you
need help, refer to AutoCAD’s online Help system.

 Working with gradient fills
 Editing hatch patterns and fills
I
n this chapter, you discover hatch patterns and fills and how to create
and edit them. Hatch patterns and fills are used to communicate section
cuts of a design, represent construction materials, and add depth to a draw-
ing so it doesn’t look flat. AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT offer two types of
hatches: hatch patterns and solid fills. Hatch patterns are made up of line
segments that are stored in pattern files, whereas solid fills are a single
color and are not made up of line segments. AutoCAD offers an additional
hatch type called gradient fills.
A gradient fill is similar to a solid fill except it’s a blend of one color with a
tint, or two colors, to give the illusion of depth and realism to a 2D drawing.
Hatching allows you to quickly add a visual representation of floor tiles,
shingles, or shakes on a roof for an architectural drawing. For a mechanical
drawing, you might use a hatch pattern that creates diagonal lines to repre-
sent the part of a model that’s shown cut through for a section view.
Hatch objects are created by default as a single object and are associative
like dimensions. Hatch objects are created associative to the objects that
form the closed boundary in which the hatch object is created. Keeping a
hatch object associative allows it to be automatically updated when the
boundary changes. Hatch objects can also be created nonassociative, which
keeps the hatch object from being updated when the boundary changes.
Hatch objects can be exploded if they are created with a hatch pattern other
than a solid or gradient fill.
Starting with AutoCAD 2008, you can make hatch objects annotative, which
affects the scale applied to a hatch pattern. I cover working with annotative
scaling in Chapter 4 of this minibook. Figure 3-1 shows a drawing that uses
hatch patterns and fills to indicate the materials used for the exterior of a
building.

Adding Hatch Patterns and Fills
304
Adding Hatch Patterns and Fills
Hatch objects are created by using the Hatch and Gradient dialog box (see
Figure 3-2) or the Hatch dialog box if you’re using AutoCAD LT. The Hatch
and Gradient dialog box allows you to specify which hatch pattern or fill
should be used to hatch (or fill) a closed boundary (or area). Based on the
type of hatch (or fill) you are creating, you might need to specify a pattern, a
scale, an angle, and other settings.
Many different settings control how the resulting hatch object looks after it’s
created. Most of the commonly used settings for creating and editing hatch
objects are displayed by default, but if you want to access some of the more
advanced settings, click the More Options button.

Adding hatch to a drawing
The first few times you add fills and patterns by hatching closed boundaries
in a drawing can be confusing, but that is to be expected because many fac-
tors in a drawing and the dialog box can affect how a hatch object is created.
When you want to create a hatch object, make sure that the area you want to
hatch is closed — meaning all lines, arcs, and so on that define a boundary
are either connected end to end or overlapping each other. Hatch objects
are created by using the Hatch and Gradient dialog box, which is displayed
with the HATCH command.
To start the HATCH command and display the Hatch and Gradient dialog
box, follow one of these methods:
✦On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Draw panel➪Hatch.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Draw menu➪Hatch.
✦On the Draw toolbar, click the Hatch button .
✦At the command prompt, type HATCH or H and press Enter.
The following procedure explains how to create a hatch object by using a
predefined hatch pattern:
1. Draw a circle or use other drawing commands to create a closed
boundary.
2. On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Draw panel➪Hatch.
The Hatch and Gradient dialog box is displayed.
3. In the Type and Pattern section, select Predefined in the Type drop-
down list.
The controls that are used with a predefined hatch pattern are enabled.
4. In the Pattern drop-down list, select one of the predefined hatch 
patterns.
A preview of the selected hatch pattern is displayed in the Swatch area
below the Pattern list. You can also click the Ellipsis button to the right
of the Pattern list to display the Hatch Pattern Palette dialog box (see
Figure 3-3). This dialog box allows you to visually select predefined
hatch patterns that come with the software or custom ones that you
might create yourself or download from the Internet.
5. In the Angle and Scale section, specify an angle for the hatch pattern
by selecting a predefined value or entering a value in the Angle drop-
down list.
6. Specify a scale for the hatch pattern by selecting a predefined value
or entering a value in the Scale drop-down list.

7. In the Boundaries section, click Add: Pick Points.
Focus is brought to the drawing window and the Hatch and Gradient dialog
box is closed while you pick points inside closed boundaries. The prompt
Pick internal point or [Select objects/remove Boundaries]: is displayed.
Picking points can increase the time it takes to hatch a closed boundary in
a complex drawing. To more efficiently add hatching to a drawing, you can
click the Add: Select Objects button and select objects that form a closed
boundary instead of picking points with the Add Pick Points button.
8. At the prompt, click inside a closed boundary to define the boundary
for the hatch object.
The boundary is calculated, and you’re prompted for additional closed
boundaries. If the boundary is not closed or the boundary can’t be cal-
culated, a message box is displayed (see Figure 3-4).

The system variable HPGAPTOL specifies whether a tolerance value is
used when calculating a closed boundary with objects that don’t form a
completely closed boundary. The value can also be specified under the
Gap Tolerance section when the Hatch and Gradient dialog box is
expanded.
9. Press Enter to accept the selected boundaries and to return to the
Hatch and Gradient dialog box.
10. Click Preview.
The hatch object is displayed in the drawing.
11. Press Esc to return to the Hatch and Gradient dialog box to make
changes or press Enter to create the hatch object.
The hatch object is created and you’re returned to the drawing window.
Hatching and tool palettes
After you’ve successfully created a hatch object in a drawing (and are fin-
ished jumping up and down with glee), you can create hatch tools on a tool
palette of that hatch object so you can create new hatch objects with the
same settings in a drawing later. You create a hatch tool by dragging and
dropping a hatch object from a drawing onto a tool palette. The hatch tool is
created based on the properties and settings of the hatch object. To use a
hatch tool that’s on a tool palette, click the tool and then click inside a
closed boundary, or drag and drop the tool over a closed boundary. For
more information on tool palettes, see Book VI, Chapter 4.
Hatching and DesignCenter
Hatch objects and hatch tools can be created from hatch pattern files by
using DesignCenter. To create a hatch object or a hatch tool, browse to a
location where you store your hatch pattern (.pat) files with DesignCenter.
Double-click the hatch pattern file, and then drag and drop the hatch pattern
over a closed boundary or over a tool palette. After the hatch tool is created
on a tool palette, you can then right-click and choose Properties to change
the general properties for the hatch tool and any hatch-specific properties.
Advanced settings for additional control
The Hatch and Gradient dialog box offers a number of options to control
how a hatch object is created and how the boundary for a hatch object is
generated. These options can be found in the Hatch Origin and Options sec-
tions and under the extended section of the Hatch and Gradient dialog box.
Being annotative
Like text and dimensions, hatch objects can be annotative, which controls the
scale of a hatch pattern based on the current annotation scale or viewport

Adding Hatch Patterns and Fills
308
scale. As the annotation scale for the current view or viewport increases, so
does the scale of the hatch object if it’s designated as annotative; this ensures
that the hatch object is always displayed correctly based on the current anno-
tation or viewport scale. I cover working with annotative scaling in Chapter 4
of this minibook.
Specifying the origin of a hatch object
The Hatch Origin section allows you to define the base point in the drawing
from which the hatch pattern is calculated. By default, the origin point of the
drawing is used, rather than a point in the closed boundary. The Specified
Origin option allows you to select a point in the drawing that should be used
for the origin of the hatch pattern assigned to the hatch object. Specifying an
origin point allows you to make the appearance of hatch patterns predictable.
This is important if you’re using hatch patterns for creating tiles, bricks, and
siding on a house; for example, you want to make sure that you have a full
run of bricks at the bottom of a house, and not just have the pattern appear
to be generated randomly. By designating the lower corner of the elevation,
you can get the bricks to start in a consistent and predictable way.
Island detection
Island detection is used when calculating the closed boundary for a hatch
object. An island is defined as an interior boundary located inside the outer
boundary of a closed boundary. To access the island detection settings, you
have to click the More Options button, which is located to the right of the
Help button of the Hatch and Gradient dialog box. Figure 3-5 shows examples
of the three island detection options:
✦Normal: The outer detected boundary is hatched, but hatch is turned
off for any detected island until another island is detected.
✦Outer: Only the outer detected boundary is hatched; no hatch is applied
to islands inside the boundary calculated.
✦Ignore: All islands are ignored and the hatch fills the entire area defined
by the outer boundary.

Working with Hatch Patterns and Solid Fills
309
The Remove Boundaries button under the Boundaries area of the Hatch and
Gradient dialog box allows you to remove and add islands to adjust the
boundary of a hatch object when it is being edited.
Others settings available for defining a hatch object
Some additional settings allow you to specify a factor that should be used
when defining a boundary that might not be completely closed. Another set-
ting allows you to create separate hatch objects for each closed boundary
that is defined when selecting objects or picking points to define boundaries.
Another nice feature is to define the order in which the hatch object is dis-
played on-screen with respect to the objects that define its boundary. For
additional information on the options of the Hatch and Gradient dialog box,
see the online Help system.
The OSOPTIONS system variable allows you to control whether object snaps
can be used with hatch objects. If the system variable is set to a value of 1 or 3,
object snaps are ignored for hatch objects.
Working with Hatch Patterns and Solid Fills
Hatch patterns and solid fills are the most commonly used types of hatches.
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT offer three types of hatch patterns that you can
use when adding hatch to a drawing: predefined, user defined, and custom.
Predefined patterns
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT come with a number of predefined patterns;
AutoCAD comes with the files acad.pat for imperial drawings and acadiso.pat
for metric drawings, while AutoCAD LT comes with the files acadlt.pat for
imperial drawings and acadltiso.pat for metric drawings. To use a predefined
hatch pattern or solid fill, select Predefined in the Type drop-down list. The
Pattern drop-down list becomes enabled, which allows you to select a pattern
in its list. Alternatively, click the ellipsis button to the right of the Pattern
drop-down list to select a pattern visually from the Hatch Pattern Palette
dialog box.
The system variable MEASUREMENT is used to control which hatch pattern
and linetype files are used for imperial or metric drawings. If MEASUREMENT
is set to a value of 0, the imperial files are used; a value of 1 indicates that
the metric files should be used.
User-defined patterns
User-defined hatch patterns are not common because they just don’t offer
much more than what the predefined hatch patterns offer. When defining a
user-defined hatch pattern, you specify the spacing and angle of lines that

Using Gradient Fills
310
run parallel or perpendicular to each other. One of the nice things about
user-defined hatch patterns is that you specify the spacing of the lines in
drawing units rather than a scale factor. To create a user-defined hatch pat-
tern, select User Defined in the Type drop-down list. After User Defined is
selected, set the angle and spacing values and specify whether double lines
should be created.
Custom hatch patterns
Custom hatch patterns are typically supplemental patterns that offer some-
thing that is not available from the predefined hatch patterns that come with
the application. Custom hatch patterns are usually much more complex than
just a series of lines that can be generated as a user-defined pattern. Custom
hatch pattern files must be placed in one of the support paths defined under
the Files tab of the Options dialog box.
To use a custom hatch pattern, select Custom in the Type drop-down list
and then click the Ellipsis button next to the Custom drop-down list to dis-
play the Hatch Pattern Palette dialog box. The Custom tab is set current and
displays the hatch patterns that AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT automatically
found in the support paths. Select the custom pattern and set the options for
the pattern just like you would a predefined pattern. For more information
on creating custom hatch patterns, see Book IX, Chapter 4.
Using Gradient Fills
Gradient fills were added to AutoCAD 2004 to replace the fills that users had
previously been creating with external paint applications. Gradient fills are
created based on a choice of one color and a tint value or two colors, the
direction of the color shift, whether the gradient is centered, and its angle.
Gradient fills are created from the Gradient tab of the Hatch and Gradient
dialog box (see Figure 3-6).
Creating a gradient fill isn’t much different from creating a hatch object that
uses a predefined, user-defined, or custom pattern. After the basic character-
istics of the gradient fill have been defined, you define the boundary for the
hatch in the same way you create one of the hatch types from the Hatch tab.
Gradient fills can’t be applied with AutoCAD LT but are displayed in AutoCAD
LT with no problems.
If a drawing is saved back to AutoCAD 2002 or earlier versions, gradient fills
are displayed as a solid fill. The color of the solid fill is based on the closest
ACI color to the first color of the gradient fill.

Editing Hatch Patterns and Fills
311
Editing Hatch Patterns and Fills
Editing a hatch object is similar to editing a text object or other objects.
Double-clicking a hatch object starts the HATCHEDIT command, which allows
you to edit a hatch object. Alternatively, you can start the HATCHEDIT com-
mand by selecting and right-clicking a hatch object and choosing Hatch Edit
from the shortcut menu. The HATCHEDIT command displays the Hatch Edit
dialog box, which is identical to the Hatch and Gradient dialog box, except
some of the options used only for creating a hatch object are disabled. Make
the necessary changes and click OK to apply the changes.
The MATCHPROP command is great for making one or more hatch objects
look the same by copying the properties from one hatch object to another. 
Use the Settings option of the MATCHPROP command to specify which general
properties of an object are copied between objects and whether the special
properties of a hatch object are also copied from the selected source object.

 Adding and removing an annotation scale
 Outputting a drawing with annotative objects
A
nnotation plays a large role in technical drawings, whether that anno-
tation is in the form of single-line or multiline text, dimensions, or
hatching. Up until AutoCAD 2008, it was difficult to control the display of
annotation in a drawing. If you plotted from the Model tab, you scaled up
your annotation objects so they plotted at the correct size, the same with
plotting annotation in a viewport on a paper space layout. However, if you
placed text on a layout, you created the text at its actual plotted size. This
was fairly simple, but after you started using viewports on a layout that con-
tained different scales for the objects on the Model tab, you ended up with
text in one viewport larger than text in the other viewport, which made
things look nonuniform. Many users worked around this problem by creat-
ing multiple annotation objects at different sizes and different layers, and
then controlling which annotation layer was displayed in the different view-
ports. Autodesk’s answer to this problem is annotation scaling, which you
might at first find confusing mainly because of the way we had to deal with
annotation since the dawn of AutoCAD.
In this chapter I take you through working with annotation objects and using
annotation scaling. If you have existing drawings that you work with, you
might have to continue calculating the height of annotation objects, but for
your new drawings you should seriously consider using annotation scaling.
The What, With, and Why of Annotation Scaling
Annotation scaling helps to simplify the issue of coming up with a text
height for the annotation objects in a drawing. For example, you might want
a text object to be 1/8" high on a drawing that’s plotted at 1/4" = 1'–0". To
determine the text height of the annotation object, you take the decimal
equivalent of 1/8" (which is 0.125) and multiple it by the result of dividing
12" by the decimal equivalent of 1/4" (which is 0.125) — in other words

Making Styles and Objects Annotative
314
0.125 * (12 / 0.25) which results in a value of 6. You would use 6" for the
height of the text on the Model tab so it would be plotted at a height of 1/8"
when the drawing was plotted at a scale of 1/4" = 1'–p.
Wouldn’t it be easier to select 1/4" = 1'–0" as the current annotation scale
and enter a height of 1/8" because that is what you want the text to be plot-
ted at anyway? With annotation scaling it is truly just that easy. You draw the
text at the scale and height you want, and AutoCAD does the rest. By using
annotation scaling, you can also control when the text is displayed by not
assigning annotation objects certain scales.
Now that you know what annotation scaling is and why you want to use it,
the last question is: What can annotation scaling be used with? Annotation
scaling can be used with the following styles and objects in a drawing:
✦Attributes
✦Block definitions
✦Block references
✦Dimension styles
✦Dimensions
✦Geometric tolerances
✦Hatches
✦Multileader styles
✦Multileaders
✦Single-line and multiline text
✦Text styles
To make using annotation scaling as easy as possible, I recommend creating
block definitions or styles for text, dimensions, and multileaders that are set
up as annotative. That way, any blocks or annotation objects in the drawing
referencing those styles are annotative and use the current annotation scale.
Making Styles and Objects Annotative
Because so many types of objects utilize annotation scaling, I feel it is best to
have one central location to explain how to work with each of the different
styles and objects. This approach hinges on knowing how to create each of
the different types of styles and objects, so you’ll probably find yourself
coming back to this chapter more than once.

Book III
Chapter 4
Scaling Mt.
Annotation
Making Styles and Objects Annotative
315
Annotative styles and block definitions
When you create or modify a text, dimension, or mulitleader style or block
definition, you have the option of making it annotative. When you make a
style or block definition annotative, all new objects that are placed with that
style current or that reference the block definition are annotative. If a non-
annotative style is made annotative, only new objects created with the style
current or new inserts of the block definition will be annotative and all exist-
ing objects will remain nonannotative. So aside from a few differences with
properties in the settings, you are telling AutoCAD that the annotative prop-
erty for the text, dimension, multileader, or block reference should be turned
on, which removes the manual step of having to do it yourself by using the
Properties palette.
The following explains how to make text styles, dimension styles, multi-
leader styles, and block definitions annotative:
✦Text styles: On the menu browser or menu bar, click Format menu➪Text
Style. In the Text Style dialog box, select Annotative in the Size area. For
more information on text styles, see Chapter 1 of this minibook.
✦Dimension styles: On the menu browser or menu bar, click Format
menu➪Dimension Style. In the Dimension Style Manager dialog box,
select Annotative in the Create New Dimension Style dialog box when
creating a new dimension style, or select Annotative in the Scale for
Dimension Features area on the Fit tab in the Modify Dimension Style
dialog box. For more information on dimension styles, see Chapter 2 of
this minibook.
✦Multileader styles: On the menu browser or menu bar, click Format
menu➪Multileader Style. In the Multileader Style Manager dialog box,
select Annotative in the Create New Multileader Style dialog box when
creating a new multileader style, or select Annotative in the Scale area
on the Leader Structure tab in the Modify Multileader Style dialog 
box. For more information on multileaders styles, see Chapter 2 of 
this minibook.
✦Block definitions: On the menu browser or menu bar, click Draw menu➪
Block➪Make. In the Block Definition dialog box, select Annotative in the
Behavior area and create a new block by selecting an insertion point and
objects for the block among other settings, or select an existing block
definition in the Name drop-down list and select Annotative in the
Behavior area. For more information on defining blocks, see Chapter 1 
of Book VI.

Making Styles and Objects Annotative
316
Annotative objects
Using annotative styles and block definitions is the easiest way to go, but
unfortunately not all objects that support annotation scaling use styles. You
might also come across the situation of working with existing annotation
objects in a drawing that need to use annotation scaling.
When placing multiline text, hatches, and attributes, you can designate the
object created as being annotative by doing the following:
✦Multiline text: When creating a multiline text, on the ribbon click
Multiline Text tab➪Style panel➪Annotative (or click the Annotative
button on the Text Formatting toolbar when the ribbon is not dis-
played). When the button is highlighted, the multiline text object will be
created as annotative. For more information on creating multiline text,
see Chapter 1 of this minibook.
✦Hatches: When creating a hatch, select Annotative in the Options area in
the Hatch and Gradient dialog box (or Hatch dialog box in AutoCAD LT).
For more information on creating hatch objects, see Chapter 3 of this
minibook.
✦Attributes: When creating an attribute, select Annotative in the Text
Settings area in the Attribute Definition dialog box. I cover creating
attributes in Chapter 1 of Book VI.
If you forget to create the annotation object as being annotative or with
some objects you do not have the object to create the object as being 
annotative, which is the case for geometric tolerances, you can use the
Properties palette. To make annotation objects annotative through the
Properties palette, follow these steps:
1. Select the annotation objects for which you want to enable the annota-
tive property.
2. Right-click the drawing window and choose Properties.
3. In the Properties palette, select the Annotative property.
4. Click the down arrow in the drop-down list that appears to the right of
the Annotative field and choose Yes.
After an object is annotative, the Annotative Scale property is accessible
from the Properties palette. For most objects, except hatches, single-line
text, multiline text, and attributes, the Annotative property is located in
the Misc category in the Properties palette. The Annotative property 
for hatches is in the Pattern category, and the Annotative property for
single-line text, multiline text, and attribute objects is under the Text 
category.
5. Click the X in the Properties palette to close it.

Book III
Chapter 4

Annotation
Adding and Removing Annotation Scales
317
After an object is annotative, a small icon appears next to the crosshairs
when the crosshairs hover on top of it. If an annotative object has one scale
assigned to it, the icon appears as a side view of an architectural scale. If
more than one annotation scale is assigned to the annotative object, the icon
appears as two architectural scales (see the upcoming Figure 4-2).
Using the Properties palette to make annotation objects annotative has its
downside. If you select objects that are of different types, you will not be
able to change the Annotative property to Yes. A way around this is to use
the CHANGE command, which is a lot more forgiving in what you select.
After you select the objects you want to make annotative, type P for the
Properties option and press Enter. Then at the Enter property to change
prompt, type A and press Enter. You will be prompted to make the objects
annotative. Type Y and press Enter. AutoCAD sifts through the selected
objects and sets the objects annotative that can be annotative and ignores
the other ones.
Adding and Removing Annotation Scales
When you create your annotative annotation object, you want to make sure
that the scale at which you want the object to be created is set current. For
example, if you’ll be plotting your drawing at 1/4" = 1'–0" make sure that you
set 1/4" = 1'–0" as the current annotation scale. To do so, click the Annotation
Scale button on the status bar to display a list of available scales. Select the
scale you want to set current, and any new annotative annotation objects
added to the drawing will automatically be assigned that scale.
If an object needs to have more than one scale, you have two choices. You
can manually add the additional scales that the annotation object might
need or you can let AutoCAD handle the task for you. When you add scales
manually, you control which annotation objects should have the additional
annotation scales; AutoCAD assigns the additional scales to all annotation
objects that are currently annotative in the drawing.
To manually add scales to an annotation object, you use the
OBJECTSCALE command, which displays the Annotation Object Scale
dialog box (see Figure 4-1). From here, you can add scales to or remove
scales from the selected annotative objects. If you select an annotative
object and right-click, you can add or remove the current annotation
scale by choosing Annotative Object Scale➪Add Current Scale or
Annotative Object Scale➪Add Delete Scale.
If you don’t want to worry about assigning multiple scales to annotation
objects as you switch between different annotation scales, click the
Automatically Add Scales to Annotative Objects button on the status bar.
When the lightning bolt has color, the option is enabled and when you

Adding and Removing Annotation Scales
318
change the annotation scale by using the Annotation Scale button on the
status bar, the new scale is assigned to all annotative objects in the drawing.
To add annotation scales to an annotative object, follow these steps:
1. Select the annotation objects to which you want to add an annotation
scale.
2. Right-click the drawing window and choose Annotative Object Scale➪
Add/Delete Scales.
The Annotation Object Scale dialog box is displayed (refer to Figure 4-1).
3. Click Add.
The Add Scales to Object dialog box is displayed.
4. Select the scales to add to the annotative object and click OK.
You return to the Annotation Object Scale dialog box and the selected
scales are added to the Object Scale List area.
5. Click OK.
To delete a scale, follow Steps 1 and 2 in the preceding list and then do the
following:
1. In the Object Scale List area, select the scales you want to remove and
then click Delete.
2. Click OK.
When an annotative object has more than one annotation scale assigned to
it, you can see all the different representations of the annotative object by
clicking the Annotation Visibility button on the status bar so that the light
bulb on the button is yellow. Then when you select the annotative object, all
Figure 4-1:

Book III
Chapter 4

Annotation
Controlling the Annotation Scale for Output
319
of its different representations are displayed as faded objects (see Figure 4-2).
This allows you to see where each representation is currently located in the
drawing. You can move each scale representation of the annotative object by
setting the appropriate annotation scale current and then using grips to
move the annotation object. Using the standard modifying techniques on 
the annotation object moves all representations of the annotative object 
uniformly.
If you have wandering representations of the annotative objects in your
drawing, you can use the ANNOREST command and select the annotative
objects to reset the positions of the scaled representations.
Controlling the Annotation Scale for Output
Now that you have assigned scales to your annotative objects, I’m sure you
are wondering what you need to do to get the scales to work when plotting
or publishing your drawing. When using the PLOT command from the Model
tab, you set current the annotation scale that matches the scale at which
you’ll be plotting your drawing. If the plot scale and the annotation scale
don’t match, AutoCAD displays the Plot Scale Confirm dialog box. If you
want to continue plotting the drawing, click Continue. Or click Cancel and
change the plot scale or annotation scale as needed. If you select Fit to
Paper in the Plot Scale area, AutoCAD assumes you know what you’re doing
and plots the drawing.
When plotting from a layout tab, there’s no annotation scale for AutoCAD to
be concerned with because the floating viewports on the layout control the
annotation scale for each viewport. When setting up the floating viewports
on a layout, make sure that the annotation scale and the viewport scale of a
viewport are set to the same scale factor. To set the viewport scale, select
the viewport and click the Viewport Scale button on the status bar. In the
scale list that’s displayed, select the scale for the viewport. Doing this typi-
cally changes both the annotation and viewport scales for the selected view-
port. However, if they are not the same, click the Annotation/Viewport Scale
Synchronization button just to the left of the Viewport Scale button on the
status bar. Then just plot the layout tab as you normally do. Any annotative

objects that do not match the selected scale are not displayed in the view-
port because there is no graphical representation for the object.
For more information on plotting and floating viewports, see Chapters 1 and 3
of Book VII. 
It’s a good idea to set the MSLTSCALE system variable to a value of 1, the
default value, to make sure that linetypes on the Model tab are scaled 
correctly, based on the current annotation scale. Other settings to check
when creating annotative objects are the system variables DIMSCALE and
MLEADERSCALE. DIMSCALE and MLEADERSCALE should both be set to 0
when using annotation scaling, and are by default when you create a new
annotative dimension or multileader style.

AutoCAD LT offers many of the same features found in AutoCAD, such as DesignCenter,
which allows you to reuse named objects from existing drawings.

T
his minibook of the AutoCAD 2009 & AutoCAD LT 2009 All-in-One Desk
Reference For Dummies takes a look at the differences between AutoCAD
and AutoCAD LT. If you are considering purchasing AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT,
you should understand what the strengths and weaknesses of the two pro-
grams are before making your final decision. Or maybe you already have
AutoCAD LT and want to know what you might be missing out on by not
having AutoCAD. In this minibook, I try to give you a good understanding of
the differences between the two programs.
Understanding the Boundaries and 
Limitations of AutoCAD LT
AutoCAD LT is a scaled-back version of AutoCAD targeted at companies that
create only 2D drawings and can’t (or don’t want to) afford the higher price
of AutoCAD. AutoCAD LT is what Autodesk refers to as an AutoCAD OEM
(Original Equipment Manufacturer) program: AutoCAD OEM is simply the
AutoCAD platform or engine with some features removed and others added
to make a new program without the need to reinvent the wheel — or re-create
the program, in this case. Using AutoCAD as the basis for AutoCAD LT guar-
antees that the files created in AutoCAD can be read by AutoCAD LT without
any problems.
AutoCAD LT contains roughly 80 percent of the functionality of AutoCAD for
about roughly 20 percent of the price. Most of the features that don’t make
it into AutoCAD LT are based on project collaboration, 3D, and the ability to
create custom programs — or add-ons as they are known in the world of
AutoCAD. Autodesk removes these features from the program to justify the
cost difference between the two programs. For the price, AutoCAD LT is an
outstanding value and ensures that you will be able to communicate with
others who use AutoCAD. However, because you can’t create or use custom
programs with AutoCAD LT, you can’t do much to change or improve on the
drafting workflow that doesn’t already come with the program through
custom add-ons as you can with AutoCAD.

Understanding the Boundaries and Limitations of AutoCAD LT

So what exactly are the differences between the two programs? The pro-
grams have a number of major and minor differences. Here is a list summa-
rizing many of the differences between the two programs:
✦User interface: For the most part, the user interfaces of AutoCAD and
AutoCAD LT are identical (see Figure 1-1). Both programs take advantage
of the Windows platform by using common user interface elements that
can be found in most Windows-based applications. These common user
interface elements are
• Ribbon
• Menu browser, pull-down menus, and shortcut menus
• Quick Access toolbar and floating/dockable toolbars
• Status bar
• Dialog boxes
• Floating/dockable windows — palettes
Some of the common AutoCAD-related UI elements, such as the Text
window, command line window, and dynamic input are present in both
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT. AutoCAD LT lacks some of the palettes found
only in AutoCAD, such as dbConnect Manager, Sheet Set Manager, and
others that are specific to visualizing 3D models. For more information
on the AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT user interfaces, see Book I, Chapter 3.

325
✦2D drafting: The foundation of both applications is 2D drafting, so both
programs are similar in the features and commands that are available for
it. A few features do stand out as different, however:
• AutoCAD supports the ability to create multilines with the MLINE
command, whereas AutoCAD LT has a command called DLINE
instead. Both commands allow you to create parallel lines, but the
DLINE command is much easier to work with.
• Groups are created and managed differently in the two programs.
AutoCAD LT offers an easier-to-use interface and is dockable, versus
the older dialog box interface that comes with AutoCAD.
• You can’t edit an Xref in-place in AutoCAD LT like you can in AutoCAD.
• Xrefs can’t be opened directly from the External References palette
in AutoCAD LT. Instead you have to browse to the drawing file and
open it with AutoCAD.
• AutoCAD provides utilities for managing attributes in a block and
synchronizing attribute changes in a block when all blocks in a draw-
ing have the same name.
• Xrefs can be clipped with the XCLIP command in AutoCAD but not in
AutoCAD LT.
For more information on 2D drafting, see Book II, Chapters 1 and 2; for
more information on working with layouts, see Book VII, Chapter 1.
✦Annotation/dimensioning: The annotation and dimension features of
the two programs are very similar, for the most part. A few notable dif-
ferences are
• AutoCAD LT lacks the ability to create gradient fills.
• The QDIM command is missing from AutoCAD LT, which helps to
improve productivity by allowing you to quickly place multiple
dimensions at a time in a drawing.
• You can create Fields with AutoCAD LT, but they do not offer the same
functionality found in AutoCAD, such as working with sheet sets.
• AutoCAD LT provides a basic utility for extracting attributes,
whereas AutoCAD allows you to extract the values of attributes and
generate the extracted data as a table.
For more information on annotating and dimensioning a drawing, see
Book III.
✦3D modeling: For the most part, 3D drawing in AutoCAD LT is nonexist-
ent. Sure, you can create wireframe models, but you can’t create surface
or solid models. AutoCAD LT does offer some limited properties that 
do allow you to create pseudo-3D objects or objects that appear to be
3D, such as giving an object thickness or drawing objects at different Z

Understanding the Boundaries and Limitations of AutoCAD LT
326
elevations. The 3D modeling capability is one of the defining features
that makes AutoCAD LT different from AutoCAD.
When modeling solids in AutoCAD, you can use a feature called dynamic
UCS, which moves the UCS to the face of the 3D solid located under the
crosshairs. AutoCAD LT also doesn’t support the ability to create a helix,
or offer true 3D modifying commands to move, rotate, align, or mirror
objects in 3D.
For more information on 3D modeling in AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, see
Book V.
✦Viewing/navigation: AutoCAD LT offers basic ways to view a drawing
compared to AutoCAD. Most of the available ways of viewing a drawing
in AutoCAD LT are
• Realtime zoom and pan, window, extents, previous, and others
• Named and preset views
• VPOINT and DDVPOINT commands
• Toggling between Perspective and Parallel view
• SteeringWheels
AutoCAD allows you to view and navigate a drawing the same way that
AutoCAD LT does, with these added navigation features:
• 3D orbit to rotate the camera around objects in the model
• Walk and fly through navigation features
• Swivel and adjust the distance from the camera
• Camera objects
• Navigate named views with motion by using ShowMotion
• Four SteeringWheels
• ViewCube to visually change between preset views and orbit the
model
For more information on viewing and navigating a drawing with
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, see Chapter 3 of Book II and Chapter 4 of
Book V.
✦Visualization/rendering: Visualizing a 3D drawing is basic in AutoCAD
LT compared to AutoCAD. AutoCAD LT allows you to display a drawing
in 2D wireframe, shaded, or as a hidden line drawing. AutoCAD LT 
doesn’t support rendering, the creation of walkthroughs or an animation,
and the use of visual styles.
For more information on visualization and rendering of a drawing in
both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, see Chapters 3 and 6 of Book V.

Book IV

327
✦Collaboration/sharing: Both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT can be used to
create drawings for a project, but AutoCAD offers features that allow better
project collaborating or sharing of design ideas. Both support the ability to
open and save files to FTP sites and work with the project collaboration
site Buzzsaw. You can put drawings on the Web through the Publish to Web
feature and send sets of drawings via eTransmit. Where the two differ is in
the Sheet Set Manager, Publish, and Drawing Security features.
• You can’t create 3D DWF and 3D DWFx files from AutoCAD LT.
• Sheet Set Manager is not part of AutoCAD LT, so you can’t use it to
share projects with AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT users.
• Drawings can’t be secured with passwords when using AutoCAD LT.
• 3D models cannot be rendered with AutoCAD LT, so if you receive a
3D model you can’t create a rendered image to share with others.
For more information on publishing drawings and project collaboration
with AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, see Books VII and VIII.
✦Data exchange: If you’re working with vendors or clients that use differ-
ent drafting packages other than AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT, you might run
into exchange problems if you’re using AutoCAD LT. AutoCAD LT doesn’t
offer as many file export and import options as AutoCAD does. If you’re
using AutoCAD LT, you can’t import or export the following file formats:
• 3D DWF file (export)
• 3D DWFx file (export)
• ACIS file (import and export)
• Stereolithograph file (export)
• Encapsulated PS file (export)
• 3D Studio file (import and export)
• Drawing Exchange Binary file (import)
For more information on exchanging drawings in other file formats other
than DWG and DXF from AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, see Chapter 4 of
Book VIII.
✦CAD standards: Both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT allow you to manage
CAD standards through the use of drawing template files, layers, styles
(text, point, dimension, and tables), and blocks just to name a few.
However, AutoCAD supplies a few additional tools that are not part of
AutoCAD LT to make sure that everyone is following the same standards.
These additional CAD standards tools are
• CAD Standards Manager
• Batch CAD standards
• Layer Translator

Understanding the Boundaries and Limitations of AutoCAD LT
328
For more information on using CAD standards with drawings created in
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, see Chapters 1 through 3 of Book VIII.
✦Customization/programming: Outside of 3D modeling, the ability to 
customize and program AutoCAD are key differences between AutoCAD
and AutoCAD LT. Although AutoCAD LT does support customization 
to a certain extent, it doesn’t support Action Recorder or programming
languages and platforms such as AutoLISP/Visual LISP, VB/VBA, C++/
ObjectARX, and .NET. This makes it impossible to get the same level of
productivity out of AutoCAD LT that you can with AutoCAD. Many third-
party applications run inside AutoCAD to help with things such as block
management, attribute extraction, modifying objects, and even pro-
grams that connect to external data sources.
For more information on customizing and programming AutoCAD and
AutoCAD LT, go to www.wiley.com/go/autocad2009aio.
✦Additional utilities: AutoCAD offers many features that are improve-
ments to older versions or features that are not available at all in
AutoCAD LT. Some of these features are
• dbConnect Manager, which allows you to link objects in a drawing to
a table in a database
• Express Tools, which contains additional tools that help with a vari-
ety of tasks in AutoCAD
• Reference Manager, an external utility that allows you to update the
paths for external referenced files and quickly identify whether files
are missing for a set of drawings
• Multiple user profiles, which are used to store different drafting set-
tings and file paths
For more information on extracting and editing attributes in blocks, see
Chapter 1 of Book VI; for more information on Express Tools, see
Chapter 4 of Book IX.
✦Software deployment: AutoCAD allows you to create a customizable
install by using the Network Deployment wizard and manage software
licenses with a license manager. AutoCAD LT doesn’t offer network
deployment and license management, which can help to control the
costs of the software. For example, if you have five drafters, but only
three are typically working in AutoCAD at a time, you can get away with
buying only four network licenses.
The license manager hands out licenses until none are left to hand out. 
If no additional licenses are available, the fifth user gets a message 
that says all licenses have been checked out. After a user closes out of

Book IV

329
AutoCAD, the license is returned to the license manager and becomes
available for the next person. The Network Deployment wizard allows
you to streamline installing AutoCAD by allowing you to specify settings
such as user profile names, custom support paths, and files that should
be used by default.
Determining Whether AutoCAD 
or AutoCAD LT Is Best for You
Now that you have an idea of what the differences are between AutoCAD 
and AutoCAD LT, you have to decide which one is right for you. It really
depends on what you are doing: 2D drafting, 3D modeling, plotting drawings,
or reviewing comments. Here are six questions that should help you to
determine whether AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT would work best for you. This
list doesn’t provide all the possible questions that can help to determine
which is best for you, but it should be enough to get you going in the right
direction. Keep in mind that you have to consider what your current needs
are and what your future needs might be:
1. Are the drawings you create or work with 2D only?
If so, you might think about using AutoCAD LT.
2. Do some of the drawings that you create or work with contain 3D
objects, or will you need to supply renderings to any of your clients?
If so, you might think about using AutoCAD. AutoCAD LT doesn’t support
rendering or the creation of 3D objects. You might also want to consider
using AutoCAD LT and Autodesk Viz if your 3D needs are centralized
around presentations.
3. Will you be doing nothing more than some light drafting, plotting, and
reviewing of DWG files?
If so, you might think about using AutoCAD LT unless you need to plot
renderings. If you just need to plot 2D drawings or know someone in 
the office who does, you can download DWG TrueView 2009 from
Autodesk’s Web site for free. I cover DWG TrueView 2009 in Chapter 2 
of this minibook.
4. Do you need or want to run third-party applications to extend the func-
tionality that comes with the program?
If so, you need to use AutoCAD and not AutoCAD LT because AutoCAD
LT doesn’t support certain forms of customization and programming 
languages.

Determining Whether AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT Is Best for You
330
5. Do you plan on working with a variety of clients and vendors?
If so, consider using AutoCAD and not AutoCAD LT. AutoCAD offers a
number of collaboration features that can make working with vendors
and clients much easier. Some of the features that make collaborating
with AutoCAD easier are CAD standards and sheet sets. If you choose 
to use AutoCAD LT, you can still work with vendors and clients, but 
you might have some additional hurdles that you will need to plan 
for. Vendors have a tough time working with the lowest common denom-
inator, AutoCAD LT in this case, if you’re missing out on productivity 
features.
6. What is your budget for software?
If you have a small budget and you do only 2D only drawings, the best
choice is AutoCAD LT. Another solution you might consider is to buy a
single seat of AutoCAD and the other seats as AutoCAD LT if you are pri-
marily doing 2D only drawings. This would allow you to at least see what
those with AutoCAD created when you receive drawings or what they
will see when you send drawings back. You can always upgrade to a full
seat of AutoCAD later if you need to as well.
If you have a medium or large budget, you might consider buying
AutoCAD and using the license manager to allow you to buy fewer
licenses than you have staff. You can then add new licenses later as
needed. If your budget simply allows you to buy what you need, you
could buy a license of AutoCAD for each user in your office and be done
with it. (And hey, if you feel extremely generous, I can always use a
license or two as well!)
No matter whether you plan on using AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT, remember
that you will be using the most popular CAD drafting package on the market
and will be able to communicate by using the DWG file format. Using the
DWG file format is important because almost all the products that Autodesk
develops can either create or read a DWG file, and many other CAD-drafting
packages on the market can at least read a DWG file, which makes DWG a
popular exchange file format as well.

T
his chapter takes a look at extending AutoCAD LT. Extending AutoCAD
LT is similar to extending AutoCAD, but the choices you have are more
limited. What exactly do I mean by extending AutoCAD LT? Extending means
adding custom functionality beyond what comes out of the box. Extending
could be creating a custom toolbar, or it could be a way to save drawing
files so they can be used in companion programs that allow you to perform
a specific task. In this chapter, you look at how you can customize AutoCAD
LT, discover what object enablers are, and find out what utilities are avail-
able from Autodesk and third-party developers.
Customizing AutoCAD LT
Although it’s true that AutoCAD LT lacks many of the methods of customiza-
tion that AutoCAD offers, it does still offer some nice customization options.
As mentioned in Chapter 1 of this minibook, AutoCAD LT doesn’t support
programming languages such as AutoLISP/Visual LISP, VB/VBA, VB .NET, 
C#, or C++ with ObjectARX or Action Recorder. Even without the capability
to use programming languages and Action Recorder to extend AutoCAD LT,
you can create script files, custom linetypes and hatch patterns, blocks, and
menu customization, and use a few other customization methods.
It’s all in the script
Script files are ASCII or plain-text files that are created with a text editor
such as Notepad. Script files contain command and command option
sequences and are used to reduce the number of repetitive or redundant
steps in a workflow. Script files can be used to perform drawing cleanup
after a drawing is created or to do some initial drawing setup. Here is an
example of a script file that creates a layer called Bolt, creates a hexagon
with a radius of 1" at the coordinates 5,5, and then performs a zoom extents:

For more information on creating and using script files, see Chapter 4 of
Book IX.
Linetype and hatch patterns
AutoCAD LT comes out of the box with a variety of linetypes and hatch pat-
terns that are used in architectural and mechanical drawings. Although quite
a few patterns are available, chances are you might need others that don’t
come with the program. Linetype and hatch patterns are stored in ASCII or
plain-text files and can be created or modified with the use of a text editor
such as Notepad. The CENTER linetype definition is shown here:
*CENTER,Center ____ _ ____ _ ____ _ ____ _ ____ _ ____
A,1.25,-.25,.25,-.25
For more information on creating custom linetypes and hatch patterns, see
Chapter 4 of Book IX.
Blocks and DesignCenter
Blocks are one of the most powerful features in AutoCAD LT. Blocks allow
you to create and define geometry once and reuse it in as many drawings as
you need. The DesignCenter palette (see Figure 2-1) allows you to access and
place blocks in a drawing, as well as access other named objects in previ-
ously created drawings and add them to your current drawing. For more
information on creating and using blocks, see Chapters 1 and 2 of Book VI,
and for information on DesignCenter, see Chapter 3 of Book VI.
Figure 2-1:
The
DesignCenter
palette.

Tool palettes
The Tool Palettes window (see Figure 2-2) allows you to organize reusable
content so you can access it quickly. Tool palettes can contain blocks and
external references, tools that allow you to create tables and hatch patterns,
and commands. For more information on creating and using tool palettes,
see Chapter 3 of Book VI.
Changing the user interface with the CUI Editor
AutoCAD LT supports the Customize User Interface (CUI) Editor, which
allows you to create and modify toolbars, menus, ribbon panels, and tabs,
shortcut keys, double-click actions, and other user interface elements. For
more information on creating and modifying user interface elements, see
Chapter 2 of Book IX.
Diesel
Diesel is an interesting form of customization in AutoCAD LT. It allows you 
to display values in the status bar area, and it can be used to create condi-
tional statements for command macros when customizing the user interface
with the CUI Editor. AutoCAD LT uses Diesel in several of its own command
macros to determine the current state of the application before running a
specific command. For example, when you use the shortcut key Ctrl+0,
which toggles Clean Screen on and off, AutoCAD LT looks to see what the
current state of Clean Screen is, on or off, and executes the correct com-
mand to change the current state. For more information on using Diesel with
the status bar or menu customization, see Chapter 2 of Book IX.

Object Enabler Technology
334
Command aliases
Command aliases are frequently used to quickly execute a command from
the command line. Instead of typing the command’s full name, you can type
a few letters to start it instead. Many of the popular commands have com-
mand aliases assigned to them right out of the box, but you can create or
modify command aliases in the ACADLT.PGP file by using a text editor such
as Notepad. For more information on creating and modifying command
aliases, see Chapter 1 of Book IX.
Desktop icons
Desktop icons are great for starting an application, but they offer so much
more capability than that. AutoCAD LT allows you to use command line
switches for changing the behavior of AutoCAD LT when you start it from a
desktop icon. For more information on modifying a desktop icon with com-
mand line switches, see Chapter 1 of Book IX.
Object Enabler Technology
Object enablers have been around since AutoCAD R14 but were first sup-
ported in AutoCAD LT with AutoCAD 2000i. Object enablers allow you to
view custom objects that are not part of the program by default. Often, you
hear about object enablers when you work with drawings created in some of
the AutoCAD-based vertical products such as Autodesk Building Systems
(ABS) or AutoCAD Architecture (formally known as Architectural Desktop —
ADT). An object enabler is a series of files that AutoCAD LT loads on demand
when it detects the use of specific custom objects; this allows for the objects
to be displayed in their original form and to be plotted correctly instead 
of not appearing at all or only being shown somewhat accurately in the
drawing.
AutoCAD LT ships with a few commonly used object enablers for other
Autodesk products. But you may need to obtain other object enablers based
on the objects created in a drawing so they can be properly displayed.
Object enablers are developed by Autodesk so that any new object types
that their programs might create can be displayed and plotted. Third-party
developers also create object enablers that work with the custom objects
that their programs add to a drawing.
Autodesk posts its object enablers on its Web site at www.autodesk.com/
enablers/. If an object in a drawing requires an object enabler and one is not
available for the object, the drawing object is still displayed in most cases,
so the drawing can still be viewed and plotted, but the object in the drawing
is known as a proxy graphic. A proxy graphic is a graphical representation of

Book IV
Chapter 2
Extending 
AutoCAD LT
Additional Utilities Available from Autodesk
335
the original object in a drawing that’s displayed in an older release or when
the object enabler is not installed. Proxy graphics were once called zombies
back in AutoCAD R13. (How fitting for a release numbered 13!)
In the Options dialog box, in the Live Enabler Options section of the System
tab, you can select the Check Web for Live Enablers option to allow AutoCAD
LT to automatically download object enablers as they are needed based on
the objects in the drawings you have open.
Additional Utilities Available from Autodesk
Even though AutoCAD LT doesn’t allow for the loading of custom applica-
tions directly into the application, Autodesk provides some utilities that run
outside AutoCAD LT to help with some processes. Some utilities are used to
convert drawings from one drawing file format to another, and others give
you the capability to view and mark up DWF files created with the PLOT or
PUBLISH commands.
DWG TrueView 2009
DWG TrueView 2009 allows you to convert an AutoCAD or AutoCAD-based
drawing file so that it can be opened with AutoCAD R14 and later. DWG
TrueView 2009 can be used to save drawing files to the latest release or even
save them back to an older version (which comes in handy if you need to
send drawings to a vendor who might still be using an older release). DWG
TrueView 2009 doesn’t require AutoCAD LT to be installed on the computer
before it can be used because it’s a standalone application. Along with
saving DWG files to an earlier release, you can also view, plot, and publish
DWG and DXF files. For more information on saving drawing files, see
Chapter 3 of Book VIII.
Viewers
Autodesk supports two viewers that allow you to view DWF, DXF, and DWG
files. If you’re creating DWF files, you should look them over before sending
them out. To do this, AutoCAD LT comes with a free DWF viewer called
Autodesk Design Review 2009, which allows you to view 2D and 3D DWF
files, measure distances between points, and create markups. For more infor-
mation on creating DWF files and Autodesk Design Review 2009, see Chapter
4 of Book VIII.
As I mention in the preceding section, DWG TrueView 2009 allows you to
view DWG and DXF files. It’s a great alternative to buying a copy of AutoCAD
LT if someone just needs to view and plot drawing files.

Companion Products from Autodesk
336
Companion Products from Autodesk
Autodesk has a huge portfolio of applications for the design community.
Many of these applications are designed to be integrated solutions with
other applications it sells. AutoCAD LT is no different, and the drawing files it
creates can be used in other applications that Autodesk offers. Autodesk
also offers many software packages that help improve productivity. Most of
the packages require the use of AutoCAD and not AutoCAD LT, but in this
section I describe some of the ones that you can use with AutoCAD LT.
Autodesk Symbols 2000
Autodesk Symbols 2000 is a library of ready-to-use blocks that are useful
whether you do architectural, mechanical, or electrical drawings. More than
12,000 symbols are available for use through DesignCenter after the symbols
have been installed. To find more information about Autodesk Symbols 2000,
visit the Autodesk Web site at www.autodesk.com/symbols.
Autodesk VIZ 2008
Autodesk VIZ 2008 is a program that allows you to create complex 3D
objects, apply materials to them, add lights, and then generate a rendered
image or an animation. You can use the objects that you create in your 2D
drawings from AutoCAD LT in Autodesk VIZ to create a 3D model for visuali-
zation purposes. If having the ability to create renderings and animations is
important for your business, and you don’t need the ability to create or use
custom add-ons for AutoCAD, you might think about buying AutoCAD LT and
Autodesk VIZ instead of a single copy of AutoCAD. Autodesk VIZ allows you
to create stunning visual effects and photo-realistic renderings. Autodesk VIZ
2008 retails for about $1,900. To find out more information about Autodesk
VIZ 2008, visit the Autodesk Web site at www.autodesk.com/viz.
Autodesk Impression
Autodesk Impression is a relatively new program developed by Autodesk. It
brings back the look and feel of hand-drawn illustrations that was lost when
the industry went to CAD. Impression allows you to create presentation
drawings from DWG and DWF files. After your drawing is open, you can fill
closed areas, insert blocks, and stylize your linework from the DWG or DWF
file so it looks like it was drawn with a marker or pencil. AutoCAD LT comes
with part of Impression built into the program, which can be accessed from
the Output tab on the ribbon. To find more information about Autodesk
Impression, visit the Autodesk Web site at www.autodesk.com/impression.

Third-Party Custom Solutions
Although Autodesk’s portfolio of applications is large, one of the company’s
keys to success has been its large development community, which builds
even more applications on or around Autodesk products. Most of the appli-
cations by third-party developers are created to run on top of AutoCAD or
one of the AutoCAD-based vertical products and not AutoCAD LT. Some 
companies create applications that run outside AutoCAD LT that allow you
to view DWG and DWF files online through Java-based applications, or to
access block libraries. Many of these types of applications can be found by
using your Web browser and search engine.
Block utilities/libraries
One of the most time-consuming things about starting to use AutoCAD LT 
is that you have to create your own block libraries. To save time, you can
download block libraries or symbols from the Internet. Many are out there
for you to use — it’s just a matter of finding them.
Table 2-1 lists some of the different Web sites that contain block utilities or
symbol libraries that you can use with AutoCAD LT. Some are free; others
aren’t.

 Using AutoCAD LT and AutoCAD in the same office
 Exchanging drawing files between AutoCAD LT and AutoCAD
I
n this chapter, I look at issues you encounter when you use AutoCAD LT
and AutoCAD in the same environment, or when you open drawings cre-
ated in AutoCAD with AutoCAD LT. Although AutoCAD LT and AutoCAD both
create DWG files and are both developed by Autodesk, that doesn’t mean
both see the same things in the same way. If you read the first two chapters
of this minibook, you already know that there are differences between
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT. If you exchange drawings between the two pro-
grams, you will discover even more differences.
Using AutoCAD LT and AutoCAD in the Same Office
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT are developed with the needs of many different
users in mind, which sometimes means that an office ends up using both
programs. If you already use AutoCAD in your office and are considering
purchasing copies of AutoCAD LT to control costs, you should pay close
attention to this section.
Budgeting
When it comes to budgeting, the first thing you may say is, “That’s not my
job.” But it is, when you think about it: You’re the one who supports or uses
the application. Everyone plays an intricate part in making the best decision
for your department or the company you work for. Three main things to
consider during budgeting are hardware, software, and training for AutoCAD
and AutoCAD LT. Being on the same release of AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT can
make things run more smoothly than if everyone is on different releases, so
you’ll want to keep in mind how much upgrades will cost and even new
seats that you may need in the upcoming year. To help make budgeting for
upgrades easier, Autodesk offers an annual subscription program.
As you upgrade your software, keep in mind that your hardware needs may
change. Having the right hardware is key to ensuring that AutoCAD runs 

Using AutoCAD LT and AutoCAD in the Same Office

efficiently. Leasing computers on a two- to three-year cycle can help with
budgeting and ensure that you’re always using some of the most current
hardware.
The final piece of the puzzle is training, which is covered in the next section.
Training
Properly trained drafters help to ensure the creation of quality drawings.
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT by themselves are not enough to create a good
drawing; it also takes time and a disciplined drafter committed to follow-
ing company CAD standards. Training not only helps to ensure quality draw-
ings but can also make sure that drawings are communicated properly to
internal departments and external vendors. Training can be performed 
by an external company or an internal member of the drafting department.
You shouldn’t assume that everyone knows and understands the company’s
CAD standards or how to communicate designs with internal or external
resources. It’s always good to have refresher courses on company proce-
dures and the software you use.
Communication
Communication is important in every aspect of the drafting process: from
capturing a client’s idea into a drawing to making sure that vendors have the
right information to bid on a project. Properly communicating company CAD
standards is vital to making a mixed office run smoothly because a process
that works on AutoCAD might not necessarily work on AutoCAD LT. Because
AutoCAD LT lacks some of the features of AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT should be
used as the basis for any company CAD standards. In the same way, those
who use AutoCAD LT need to communicate what is not working for them
back to those creating drawings with AutoCAD. A communication break-
down sometimes occurs when AutoCAD users don’t realize that a certain
function isn’t supported by AutoCAD LT and users of AutoCAD LT don’t
report the issue.
Environment
Although AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT are very similar, they are slightly differ-
ent in the interfaces and commands they offer. Just because people know
AutoCAD fairly well, don’t automatically assume that they will be proficient
at using AutoCAD LT. Some features that they routinely use in AutoCAD may
not be available in AutoCAD LT, which can lead to some frustration. It’s
easier for a user to go from AutoCAD LT up to AutoCAD than it is for a user
of AutoCAD to move down to AutoCAD LT.

Customization
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT share some commonalities when it comes to cus-
tomization. To make sure that upgrading and supporting the two programs is
as easy as possible, place all custom files in networked locations so they can
be shared between the two programs. Files such as scripts, custom line-
types, and hatch pattern files are easily shareable between the two programs
because they are not product- or release-specific (as long as you do not use
commands for features that are only in AutoCAD), whereas CUI files, stan-
dard linetype, and hatch pattern files are specific to each program. You can
share CUI files between AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT if you create custom CUI
files and load them as partial CUI files. Also keep in mind that AutoCAD LT
does not support programming, so a command in a shared CUI file can’t ref-
erence a custom command that is defined in a custom program file. Blocks
and drawing templates are program neutral, so you can safely create blocks
and drawing templates that can be shared between both programs.
Installation and deployment
Installing and deploying AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT are somewhat different
based on the type of licensing you have or plan on purchasing. AutoCAD can
be deployed by using a license manager that distributes licenses, which
makes it easy to manage the number of licenses in use. AutoCAD LT doesn’t
support this option. Both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT support standalone and
multiseat deployment installation options. AutoCAD LT doesn’t support the
use of profiles, so you need to manually add or change any support paths
that are necessary so that each one can locate company standard files such
as templates and blocks.
Making the Trip from AutoCAD to AutoCAD LT
Exchanging drawings created in AutoCAD with those who use AutoCAD LT
can be a challenge at times, based on which features you’re using. If you use
AutoCAD and are sharing drawings with someone who uses AutoCAD LT, you
don’t have to do anything special. However, you might need to show some
restraint in using certain features if it’s important for those on AutoCAD LT
to be able to modify your drawings. In the next sections, I’ve gathered some
of the key areas that you should know about if you are an AutoCAD LT user
and work on drawings created in AutoCAD. I also cover issues for those of
you who use AutoCAD and send out drawings to vendors that might be using
AutoCAD LT.

2D drafting
AutoCAD allows you to create multilines. Multilines are a series of parallel
lines that can have different colors and linetypes for each parallel line seg-
ment making up the object. They are commonly used for streets, showing
the main part of the road and any offsets that the municipality or city
requires from the road, and can also be used for floor and basement plans of
buildings. When a drawing with multilines is opened in AutoCAD LT, you
don’t have any control over the object other than changing its standard
object properties and being able to grip edit the object. If you need to make
changes to the lines themselves, you have to explode the multiline object,
which can be frustrating to the individual who originally sent you the draw-
ing if you need to send it back to them.
Another issue that you have to deal with is the clipping of blocks and exter-
nal references. AutoCAD LT displays the clipping frame, but you can’t
remove the clipping unless you remove the external reference object and
reattach it. Figure 3-1 shows an external reference without a clipping bound-
ary (on the left) and the same external reference with a clipping boundary
(on the right). AutoCAD LT can also make it hard to tell whether an external
reference has been clipped unless the frame is left on. For more information
on multilines, see Chapter 1 of Book II; for more information on external ref-
erences, see Chapter 3 of Book VI.
3D modeling
The ability to work with drawings that contain 3D solids and surfaces is lim-
ited in AutoCAD LT. In AutoCAD, you have many ways to modify 3D solids
and surfaces, such as through the use of grips and the SOLIDEDIT command;
these are not available in AutoCAD LT. AutoCAD LT doesn’t allow you to
create and modify 3D solids and surfaces besides using basic modifying 
Figure 3-1:
Clipped

references.

Chapter 3

commands such as move, copy, and rotate. You are limited to changing only
general properties of 3D solids and surfaces, such as their color, what layer
they are on, and other general properties available for all object types.
However, a 3D solid or surface can be exploded into wireframe models that
are made up of regions or 2D objects.
If a drawing has a section plane and Live Section is enabled for the section
plane, it won’t look the same in AutoCAD LT as it does in AutoCAD (see
Figure 3-2). The Live Section is not displayed, but the section plane will exist
in AutoCAD LT, so if the drawing is saved and reopened in AutoCAD, it looks
just like it did before it was opened in AutoCAD LT.
For more information on 3D solids and surfaces, see Chapters 4 and 5 of
Book V and Bonus Chapter 1 on the Web at www.wiley.com/go/autocad2009aio.
Annotation
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT have few differences in annotation. The two main
differences that you have to be concerned about when exchanging drawing
files between AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT are gradient fills and fields. Both
gradient fills and fields are displayed in AutoCAD LT without any problems,
but gradient fills and fields with sheet set values can’t be created or edited. If
you use the HATCHEDIT command on a gradient fill, it turns into a solid fill. If
you change the boundary associated with a gradient fill, it continues to exist
as a gradient fill in the drawing.
Fields are used to associate properties of a drawing file or an object in the
drawing with text, multiline text, a table cell, or an attribute. Fields can help
make sure that information remains in sync when something is changed in
the drawing or an object is modified. Based on the type of field, it displays
the last value or updates according to changes in the drawing file. You can
change the value of a field as long as it is not associated with a sheet set
because AutoCAD LT does not support sheet sets. For more information on

hatch in a drawing, see Chapter 3 of Book III; for more information on fields,
see Chapter 1 of Book III.
Viewing
Cameras are displayed as glyphs in AutoCAD and are accessible from either
the drawing window or the View Manager dialog box. AutoCAD LT doesn’t
display camera glyphs in the drawing, but it does list the camera in the View
Manager dialog box. AutoCAD LT also doesn’t support several properties
that are available for a named view in AutoCAD. These properties are for
things such as backgrounds and live sections, which are not supported in
AutoCAD LT. AutoCAD LT also does not support motion assigned to a named
view and ShowMotion.
Visualization
Drawings created with AutoCAD can contain a variety of additional objects
and settings that really don’t do anything in AutoCAD LT: One example is
lights. Lights appear in the drawing and can be selected and modified via
grips, but you can’t alter their properties. Because AutoCAD LT lacks the
ability to do renderings, you won’t be able to use any material assignments
that are on objects or be able to modify the materials stored in a drawing
file. This can cause problems if a viewport on a layout tab is set up to use
the Realistic visual style that AutoCAD offers. For the most part, all visual
styles are supported by AutoCAD LT, with the exception of Realistic (see
Figure 3-3). The visual styles can’t be changed, but if they are assigned to a
viewport on a layout tab, they will be displayed correctly.
CAD Standards
The CAD Standards feature of AutoCAD uses Drawing Standards (DWS) files
that are associated with the drawing file, but AutoCAD LT doesn’t use or

AutoCAD LT.

know about these files. This isn’t a problem with AutoCAD LT because the
feature doesn’t exist in LT, but it can become a nightmare if you work on a
set of drawings and use the eTransmit feature to repackage them to send off
to someone else. Because AutoCAD LT doesn’t know about these types of
files, it doesn’t know enough to inform you that they might be missing or are
needed when sending off a set of drawings.
Collaboration and sharing
Collaboration plays a large role in designing a building, creating a machine,
or engineering a bridge. All these things and many more don’t just happen
by themselves: They require collaboration. AutoCAD allows you to create a
sheet set with all the drawing files related to a project and maintain links
from model views to drawing layouts. AutoCAD LT doesn’t support the use
of sheet set (DST) files because it doesn’t have the Sheet Set Manager
palette, so any values that reference part of the sheet set file through fields
can’t be updated. If a field value needs to be changed, it must be replaced
with plain text, which causes problems if it is reopened later in AutoCAD.

his book of the AutoCAD 2009 & AutoCAD LT 2009 All-in-One Desk Reference
For Dummies takes you on a journey to a whole new dimension. I’m talk-
ing about not traveling through space or time, but rather giving your draw-
ing some depth or height based on how you look at it. AutoCAD is a powerful
2D drafting tool, but it also sports a nice set of tools for 3D modeling.
AutoCAD LT, unlike its older counterpart, has limited 3D drafting, visualiza-
tion, and viewing capabilities. Most of what is discussed in the chapters of
this minibook is geared toward only AutoCAD; but some things apply to
AutoCAD LT, and I point those out to you along the way.
Most drafters think and feel most comfortable when drafting in 2D; this makes
3D modeling seem foreign and often more difficult than it really is. 3D model-
ing is not all that difficult — much of what was covered in previous minibooks
applies to 3D drafting.
AutoCAD allows you to create three types of 3D models: wireframe, solid,
and surface. AutoCAD LT is capable of creating and editing only wireframe
models, but you can use it to view solid and surface models.
Throughout the chapters in this minibook, you see how to select points
above the x,y coordinate plane, and how to adjust and manipulate the coor-
dinate system to more easily use drafting commands. After you have mas-
tered selecting points in the drawing and working with the coordinate
system, I take you on a tour of some of the navigation and viewing com-
mands that AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT offer for viewing 3D models. After you
have the basics under your belt, I show you how to use many of the differ-
ent modeling and editing commands that are used with solids and surfaces.
To close out the minibook, I touch on the concepts of creating renderings
from AutoCAD. 3D modeling in AutoCAD is a huge area of the program, and
would take an entire book to cover everything efficiently — actually, there is
a companion book that covers 3D modeling in AutoCAD, titled AutoCAD
2008 3D Modeling Workbook For Dummies.

Understanding the Different Types of 3D Models
350
Understanding the Different Types of 3D Models
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT allow you to create and view drawings that are
created as wireframe, surface, or solid models. These different types of
models each have their own strengths and weaknesses:
✦Wireframe model: Wireframe models are created with the use of 2D
objects such as lines, arcs, polylines, and circles with no thickness. The
2D objects are drawn in 3D space by using full x, y, and z coordinates,
not just x- and y-coordinate values. Wireframe models are not intended
to be used for visualization because they do not have any surface area
that allows them to hide objects beyond the geometry that they repre-
sent. Wireframe models provide for a great starting point when creating
surface models. Figure 1-1 shows a cube with a hole drawn as a wire-
frame model and displayed with the HIDE command. You can think of a
wireframe model as being much like a wire hanger or a bird cage.
✦Surface model: Surface models are created from 3D objects called faces.
Faces can be made up of three or four points. Unlike wireframe models,
surface models can be used for visualizing a design. However, based on
the type of visualization, such as a hidden line drawing, some cleanup
might be necessary to hide the edges of faces that form a visible side of
the model. AutoCAD offers several commands that allow you to create
and manipulate surfaces. Figure 1-2 shows the same cube with a hole
drawn in it as shown in Figure 1-1, with the exception that it was drawn
as a surface model. The HIDE command shows each surface and edge
visible from the current viewpoint of the surface model. You can think of
a surface model as being much like a cardboard shipping box: It’s hollow
on the inside but from the outside it looks like a solid object because it’s
a fully closed object.
Figure 1-1:

Entering Coordinates above the x,y Plane
351
✦Solid model: Solid models are created from 3D objects called solids
which come in two forms: primitives and compound. Solid objects are
much more flexible than faces and 2D objects for creating wireframe and
surface models. Solid objects can be created and modified through a
number of commands in AutoCAD. These commands allow you to create
primitive objects such as cubes, spheres, and cones, and then combine
them to form compound objects. Unlike surfaces, solids do have mass
and therefore are not hollow, which allows you to capture information
about them. Solids are much easier to work with than surfaces. Figure
1-3 shows a cube with a hole drawn as a solid model and displayed with
the HIDE command. The HIDE command shows the surfaces and edges
of the solid model. You can think of a solid model as being much like a
block of solid wood: It is not hollow on the inside unless you do some-
thing to it.
Entering Coordinates above the x,y Plane
Everything you’ve read up to this point has been using the x- and y- coordi-
nate values. This is all about to change as you step in a new direction with
the z coordinate. Most of AutoCAD’s commands are not true 3D commands;
this means that commands such as PLINE, which is used to create polylines,

Entering Coordinates above the x,y Plane

can be used to draw a polyline only at a single z height (or elevation) for all
its vertices. Out of what are known as the traditional 2D commands, only the
LINE command allows you to specify two different z heights for the start and
end points of the line object that is being created.
Manually inputting coordinates
Chapter 7 of Book I explains how to input relative and absolute coordinates
for 2D drafting. Both of these coordinate input formats are great for 3D mod-
eling as well. The only difference that you’ll find when working in 3D is the
need to enter a z coordinate value. Along with those coordinate input for-
mats, the relative polar coordinate input is expanded to include two addi-
tional formats called cylindrical and spherical, which are specific to 3D
modeling. Of course, you can use object snaps, point filters, and object snap
tracking when creating and modifying 3D objects.
You can input coordinate values through the use of direct distance entry and
the using of dynamic input. Both of these are covered in Chapters 3 and 7 of
Book I.
Absolute x, y, and z coordinates
Working with absolute coordinates in 3D is just like inputting them for 2D,
except you add the z coordinate. You supply the coordinate input in the
format x,y,z. Following is an example of using the LINE command to draw a
line in 3D by using absolute coordinate entry:
Command: line
Specify first point: 0,0,0
Specify next point or [Undo]: 2,3,7.25
Relative x, y, and z coordinates
Working with relative coordinates in 3D is just like when inputting them for
2D, except you add the z coordinate. You supply the coordinate input in the
format of @x,y,z. An example of using the LINE command to draw a line in 3D
by using relative coordinate entry is
Command: line
Specify first point: 2.125,7,-3
Specify next point or [Undo]: @0.5,0.125,7
Cylindrical coordinates
Cylindrical coordinates is the first of two coordinate input formats based on
relative polar coordinates used in 3D. You supply the coordinate input in the

Book V
Chapter 1

format @XYdistance<angle,Z. Following is an example of using the LINE com-
mand to draw a line in 3D by using cylindrical coordinate input:
Command: line
Specify first point: 0,0,0
Specify next point or [Undo]: @5<45,2
Figure 1-4 shows the results in AutoCAD.
Cylindrical coordinate input doesn’t work well when dynamic input is
enabled. I recommend turning it off by clicking the Dynamic Input (or DYN)
button on the status bar area or by pressing F12.
Spherical coordinates
Spherical coordinates is the second coordinate input format based on rela-
tive polar coordinates used in 3D. You supply the coordinate input in the
format of @XYdistance<angle<anglefromXY. An example of using the LINE
command to draw a line in 3D by using spherical coordinate input is
Command: line
Specify first point: 0,0,0
Specify next point or [Undo]: @5<30<30
Figure 1-5 shows the results in AutoCAD.

354
Point filters
You can use point filters to construct coordinate values based on existing
points on an object whether it’s in 2D or 3D. Three point filters are specific
to 3D modeling: xy, xz, and zy. Point filters can be typed at the command
prompt, selected from the Object Snap shortcut menu by pressing and hold-
ing down the Shift key while right-clicking, or right-clicking and choosing
Snap Overrides. Here’s an example of using the LINE command to draw a line
in 3D by using the xy point filter entry:
Command: line
Specify first point: specify a point or a coordinate value
Specify next point or [Undo]: type .xy and press enter
of specify a point or a coordinate value
(need Z): specify a point or a Z height value
Object snaps
Object snaps are a great way to ensure that you have the precise point you
want in the drawing. AutoCAD has a toggle that controls whether the z
height of the point you select by using an object snap or the current eleva-
tion value is used. (I cover changing the current elevation later in this chap-
ter.) To switch between these two behaviors, follow these steps:
1. Right-click over the command line window, and choose Options.
The Options dialog box appears.
2. In the Options dialog box, click the Drafting tab.

3. Click the Replace Z Value with Current Elevation check box.
When you select the Current Elevation check box, AutoCAD substitutes
the z height that was obtained from the object snap with the current ele-
vation. When the check box is not selected, AutoCAD uses the z height
of the coordinate specified from the object snap.
AutoCAD LT does not have the Replace Z Value with Current Elevation option.
Object snap tracking and moving orthogonally
Object snap tracking can be used above the current x,y plane. Object snap
tracking allows you to track points in the z direction. When using object
snap tracking in the z direction, AutoCAD provides feedback in the form of
tooltips when you are moving in the positive or negative z direction. Figure
1-6 shows an example of the tooltip displayed in AutoCAD when using object
snap tracking in 3D.
You can use ortho mode in 3D just like in 2D, with the addition of being able
to constrain the movement of the crosshairs in the positive and negative z
directions. When you drag the crosshairs up or down after specifying the
first point when ortho mode is enabled, you’re specifying the next point in
the z direction. A tooltip is displayed to tell you which direction from the
first point you’re moving in.
AutoCAD LT does support the use of object snap tracking in 3D, but it does
not the use ortho mode to constrain the movement of the crosshairs in the 
z direction.
Elevation . . . going up
Specifying a z height when entering coordinates is not the only way to draw
objects above the x,y plane; you can specify a default z height for all new
objects as they are created. If you’re drawing a bunch of objects that need a

Entering Coordinates above the x,y Plane
356
specific z height, this can be an efficient way to ensure that they are placed
at the correct height. You use the ELEV command to specify the default z
height used for new objects as they are created. The specified value is used
only if you don’t use object snaps; if you use object snaps, the z height of the
object snap is used by default. See the “Object snaps” section, presented
earlier in this chapter, for more information.
To set a new elevation value, type ELEV at the command prompt and enter a
new elevation value at the Specify new default elevation <0.0000>: command
prompt. Then at the Specify new default thickness <0.0000>: command
prompt, press Enter or enter a thickness value. I cover using thickness in
Chapter 4 of this minibook.
Instead of changing the current elevation, you can use a custom UCS (user
coordinate system) to create objects at a specific elevation. I cover the user
coordinate system and the world coordinate system in Chapter 2 of this
minibook.

hapter 1 of this minibook covers the three types of 3D models you can
create with AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, as well as how to enter coordi-
nates above the xy (or working) plane in the z direction. This chapter helps
you get a grasp of the 3D environment in AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT. I take a
look at some of the key settings and features that help you work efficiently
with 3D models. Some of these settings are for getting the most out of your
computer investment by enabling hardware acceleration if it is available.
You can also change other settings to control the appearance of the grid, 
the background color, and more in the drawing window.
One of the keys to becoming an efficient drafter with AutoCAD is to under-
stand what the UCS icon is indicating, and in 3D drafting that is no different.
The UCS icon provides you with information on which way is up or down in
your model, and the direction of the x, y, and z axes. You can also modify
the coordinate system to draw 2D objects on a different plane. 2D objects
are always drawn on the xy (or working) plane, so by changing the direction
or elevation of the plane you can draw 2D objects on a new plane.
Setting Up AutoCAD for 3D
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT offer various display, hardware, and drafting
options that all play different roles when working with 3D. Properly configur-
ing and understanding all these options can make modeling easier. Because
AutoCAD LT doesn’t support the creation of surface and solid models, many
of these options are not available in LT. I point out the differences as I go
along.

Setting Up AutoCAD for 3D

Orienting yourself in the drawing window
The drawing window is where you create, modify, and view 3D models.
Based on how you are viewing a model, the background color, grid display,
and crosshairs change in the drawing window. You can customize the dis-
play settings for the drawing window through the Drawing Window Colors
dialog box (see Figure 2-1). To display the Drawing Window Colors dialog
box, click the Colors button under the Window Elements section on the
Display tab of the Options dialog box. The Options dialog box can be dis-
played by clicking Tools menu➪Options on the menu browser or menu bar.
When working in 3D, you can view a 3D model in parallel or perspective pro-
jection. The projection mode (or context) you are currently in affects the dis-
play of the model as well as the colors used for various window elements in
the drawing window. In AutoCAD LT, only one context, called hidden, is
related to 3D drafting.
The following steps explain how to adjust the background color of the draw-
ing window and the color tinting used for the crosshairs under the 3D paral-
lel projection context (or the hidden context if you’re using AutoCAD LT):
1. Right-click the drawing window (with no command active) and choose
Options.
The Options dialog box is displayed.
2. In the Options dialog box, click the Display tab.

3. In the Window Elements section, click Colors.
The Drawing Window Colors dialog box is displayed.
4. In the Context list, select 3D Parallel Projection (or Hidden if you’re
using AutoCAD LT).
The Preview at the bottom of the dialog box updates to show the current
colors that the interface elements are set to and which interface ele-
ments are available.
5. In the Interface Element list, select Uniform Background (or
Background if you’re using AutoCAD LT).
The Color drop-down list displays the current color.
6. Click the Color drop-down list and select White.
The color white will be assigned to the background of the drawing
window.
7. In the Interface Element list, select Crosshairs.
The Color drop-down list displays the current color, and the Tint for 
X, Y, Z (or X, Y in AutoCAD LT) check box becomes enabled.
8. Select the Tint for X, Y, Z check box below the Color drop-down list.
The Tint for X, Y, Z (or X, Y) option is used to tint the crosshairs with 
the colors of red, green, and blue to represent the different axes. The 
X axis is always represented by the color red, Y by green, and Z by blue
(in AutoCAD only). The tinting is by default enabled for the different 3D
contexts.
If you like the color tinting of the crosshairs, you can enable it for the
other contexts that are not used for 3D.
9. Click Apply & Close.
The changes are saved and the Drawing Window Colors dialog box
closes.
10. Click OK.
The changes are saved and the Options dialog box is closed.
If you or someone you know is colorblind or sensitive to the colors red,
green, or blue, you may want to turn off the tinting for the crosshairs
because the specific colored axes can disappear from view.
Customizing crosshairs and dynamic input
You can customize the display of the crosshairs and dynamic input for work-
ing in 3D in AutoCAD only. These changes go beyond being able to change
the size of the crosshairs or even the tinting of the different axes of the

Setting Up AutoCAD for 3D
360
crosshairs. These options allow you to enable the display of labels on the
crosshairs so you know which direction x, y, and z are without having to 
display the UCS icon. You can also control whether the z direction is indi-
cated on the crosshairs as well. If you use dynamic input and manually enter
points, you can control the display of an additional input field for entering 
z-coordinate values. You can change these options under the 3D Crosshairs
and Dynamic Input sections of the 3D Modeling tab in the Options dialog
box. The 3D Modeling tab is not available in AutoCAD LT.
Using workspaces to switch between 
2D and 3D drafting
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT come with a feature called Workspaces. Workspaces
were introduced in AutoCAD 2006 and play a role in efficiently switching
between different task-based drafting tools. I talk about working with work-
spaces in Chapter 2 of Book IX.
AutoCAD 2009 comes with a workspace named 3D Modeling. This work-
space displays many of the common ribbon panels and panels specific to 
3D modeling and the Tool Palettes window. The menu bar, all toolbars, and
the layout tabs at the bottom of the drawing window are hidden by default in
this workspace. To switch to the 3D Modeling workspace, on the status bar
at the bottom of AutoCAD choose Workspace Switching➪3D Modeling.
Introducing toolbars and ribbon tabs for 3D
AutoCAD comes with a number of toolbars and ribbon tabs that contain 
3D-related tools for creating, editing, and navigating your drawings.
✦The Modeling toolbar contains tools for creating 3D solid objects and
some of the more common editing tools.
✦The Solid Editing toolbar contains tools that are used for editing indi-
vidual faces and edges of a 3D solid.
✦The ribbon, shown in Figure 2-2, enables you to access many of the dif-
ferent commands for creating, editing, navigating, and visualizing 3D
models. These commands are organized on different tabs:
• The Home tab has tools that allow you to create, modify, and view 3D
objects.
• The Visualize tab has tools that allow you to add lighting, materials,
and visual styles to a model.
• The View tab has tools that allow you to work with the UCS, view-
ports, and 3D palettes.
• The Output tab has tools that allow you to render a 3D model.

Book V
Chapter 2
Using the 3D
Environment

361
AutoCAD provides other toolbars and palettes that are useful for working
with various aspects of 3D. Many of these palettes and toolbars are dis-
cussed in later chapters of this minibook.
The ribbon is new in AutoCAD 2009 and allows you to access both 2D and 
3D drafting commands, along with other 3D features. The ribbon can also be
found in AutoCAD LT 2009 but does not display 3D-related commands.
Accelerating your hardware
AutoCAD can use either software or hardware acceleration to display the
graphics in the drawing window. AutoCAD LT, however, does not support
hardware acceleration. By default, AutoCAD will attempt to use hardware
acceleration (because some graphics cards are not designed for CAD appli-
cations, AutoCAD may default to software acceleration right out of the gate).
AutoCAD might choose to use software acceleration based on your current
graphics driver; you can check to see if a later driver for your graphics card
is available by visiting the AutoCAD Certification Web site
(www.autodesk.com/autocad-graphicscard).
When you first start AutoCAD, the program evaluates your graphics card
and determines whether it can properly support hardware acceleration. If it
can, it informs you that your hardware is capable of this. At times your
graphics card might not support all features that use hardware acceleration,
so AutoCAD tweaks its display settings a little to help optimize regenerations
and the overall display quality of the objects in the drawing window. This
process is called adaptive degradation.
The Adaptive Degradation and Performance Tuning dialog box (see Figure
2-3) allows you to change the display options and toggle between the use 
of software and hardware acceleration. To open this dialog box, open the
Options dialog box and click Performance Settings under the 3D Performance
section of the System tab. Click Manual Tune to toggle open the Manu
Performance Tuning dialog box, which allows you to enable hardware accel-
eration and change the options related to using hardware acceleration, such
as Full Shadow and Smooth Line display.

Understanding What the USC Icon Is Telling You
362
Understanding What the UCS Icon Is Telling You
The UCS icon is similar to a tour guide that helps you to stay on the right
path (rather than the left I guess). The UCS icon doesn’t tell you to stay with
the tour and to keep up, but it does help you find the positive x, y, and z
axes. It’s important to know in which direction these axes are going when
creating objects. It can get frustrating when you can’t get your objects cre-
ated in the right direction.
Orientating yourself with the UCS icon
The UCS icon can be strange at times depending on how you’re viewing the
drawing and whether you’re in model or paper space. The UCS icon is a
drafter’s survivalist tool, much like any good hikers or campers venturing
into the woods will have a compass with them. AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT
display different UCS icons for different situations; understanding these situ-
ations is necessary to help maximize the use of the user coordinate system,
which I talk about later in this chapter. The UCS icon lets you know how the
coordinates you type at the command prompt are affected. The appearance
of the UCS icon is affected by the current visual style or whether the current
view is displayed as hidden or shaded. I talk about visual styles, hiding, and
how to apply shading to a model in Chapter 3 of this minibook.
Model space and 2D wireframe visual style
When you’re looking down at the xy (or working) plane, the UCS icon 
shows the positive direction for the x and y axes. If the current view of the xy
(or working) plane is from an angle like one of the preset isometric views,
Figure 2-3:

Book V
Chapter 2
Using the 3D
Environment
Understanding What the UCS Icon Is Telling You
363
you’ll see the x, y, and z axes called out. Figure 2-4 shows the UCS icon as it
appears when looking at the xy (or working) plane straight on and from an
angle. If you don’t see a box at the intersection of the x and y indicators, this
informs you that you are not looking at the drawing from the world coordi-
nate system but instead at a user-defined coordinate system, as shown in
the rightmost image of the UCS icon.
Model space and a 3D visual style
When you’re looking down at the xy (or working) plane, the UCS icon shows
the positive direction for the x and y axes, and the z direction coming
toward or moving away from you. If the current view of the xy (or working)
plane is from an angle like one of the preset isometric views, you’ll see the x,
y, and z axes called out. Figure 2-5 shows the UCS icon as it appears when
looking at the xy plane straight on and from an angle.
Paper space layout
On a paper space layout, the UCS icon appears as a triangle and indicates
the directions of the positive x and y axes only (see Figure 2-6). You can’t
change the display angle of a paper space layout because this layout is used
to represent a virtual piece of paper and is not used for modeling.

Controlling the display of the UCS icon
The UCS icon by default has a 3D appearance to it and is displayed with a
specific size, color, and location. You can tailor the display of the UCS icon
with the UCS Icon dialog box (see Figure 2-7) and the 3D Modeling tab of the
Options dialog box. To display the UCS Icon dialog box: From the menu
browser or menu bar, choose View menu➪Display➪UCS Icon➪Properties.
You can control where and if the UCS icon is displayed on-screen by using
the following options:
✦Hide/Show the UCS icon: You can toggle the display of the UCS icon. On
the menu browser or menu bar, click View menu➪Display➪UCS Icon➪On.
✦Display the UCS icon at the origin: You can toggle the display of the
UCS icon at the origin of the drawing. On the menu browser or menu bar,
click View menu➪Display➪UCS Icon➪Origin. If the UCS can’t be dis-
played at the origin, AutoCAD places it in the lower-left corner of the
drawing window.
✦Display the UCS icon in 2D or 3D visual styles: You can control whether
the UCS icon is displayed when the model is being viewed with a 2D or
3D visual style. This option is available only in AutoCAD, and not in
Figure 2-7:

AutoCAD LT. To control the display of the UCS icon in 3D, display the
Options dialog box, click the 3D Modeling tab, and uncheck the Display
in 3D Model Space — Display UCS Icon check box in the Display ViewCube
or UCS Icon section. In the same section, you can also control the dis-
play of the UCS icon in 2D model space by selecting or not selecting the
Display UCS Icon in 2D Model Space option.
Using the Coordinate System for 3D Drawing
The coordinate system in AutoCAD is powerful and can be mysterious at
times. When you are drawing in 2D, you don’t worry too much about altering
the coordinate system. When working in 3D, it becomes important to know
how to properly alter and use the coordinate system. By altering the coordi-
nate system, you can draw objects going in different directions or on the
sides of other objects. For example, you can draw an object on the xy (work-
ing) plane and then move or rotate the object into place, but that would take
some effort. By relocating the origin and direction of the coordinate system,
you can draw the object as if the object were on the xy (working) plane.
Right-hand rule for left-brained people
When you first look at the coordinate system in
3D, you may feel a little overwhelmed, which is
understandable. After all, the UCS can be
moved and rotated. So at times you may not
know which way you are heading in the z direc-
tion or which way around an axis is the positive
angle of rotation. AutoCAD provides a method
called the right-hand rule that you can apply
when you need to figure out the direction of
positive z and the positive angle of rotation.
To identify the positive z axis with the right-
hand rule, you place the back side of your right
hand toward the monitor so that your palm is
facing you. Take your thumb and point it in the
direction of the positive x axis, and then take
your index finger and extend it out so it forms a
right angle with your thumb. Make sure that
your index finger points in the direction of the
positive y axis. Bend your middle finger toward
you so it makes a right angle with your index
finger. Your middle finger now indicates the
positive direction of the z axis. To identify the
direction of positive rotation around an axis in
3D space, point your thumb on your right-hand
in the positive direction of the axis and then curl
your fingers. The direction that your fingers curl
in indicates the positive direction of rotation
around that axis.

Using the Coordinate System for 3D Drawing
366
Understanding the coordinate system
AutoCAD has two coordinate systems: world and user. You use both coordi-
nate systems when creating new objects in a drawing.
World coordinate system (WCS)
The world coordinate system, or WCS, is a fixed coordinate system that all
objects in a drawing are stored and defined to. By default in 2D views, the x
axis runs horizontal (left and right) and the y axis runs vertical (up and
down). Positive x is to the right and positive y is up. Unlike the user coordi-
nate system, the WCS can’t be moved or redefined.
User coordinate system (UCS)
The user coordinate system, or UCS, is a movable coordinate system and is
much more flexible for creating and editing objects. The UCS affects coordi-
nate entry, drafting aids (object snap tracking, dynamic input, grid, and
others), and the orientation of dimensions and text.
Adjusting the UCS
AutoCAD offers a variety of ways to create and save custom UCSs for future
use. When you want to create a new UCS, you have some options as to how
you want to create it, such as by selecting three points in the drawing to indi-
cate origin, positive x, and positive y, or selecting an object. After you specify
a new UCS, you can decide to save it for future use by giving it a name.
Commanding the UCS
The user coordinate system can be changed through the use of the UCS com-
mand. To make it easy to create a new UCS, AutoCAD offers a number of
options that you can choose from the New UCS submenu under the Tools
menu on the menu browser. The New UCS submenu has 11 choices, but the
command prompt offers a few more. I’ve listed some of the most commonly
used options of the UCS command to get you started. After the option is
specified, follow the displayed prompts. For more information on using the
UCS options, refer to AutoCAD’s online Help system.
✦World: Changes the UCS to match the world coordinate system.
✦Face: Allows you to align the UCS to the face of a 3D solid.
✦View: Creates a new UCS by rotating the xy plane to being perpendicular
to your current viewing direction.
✦3 Point: Allows you to specify a new origin for the UCS and designate the
positive direction for both the x and y axes.

Book V
Chapter 2
Using the 3D
Environment
Using the Coordinate System for 3D Drawing
367
Using named UCSs
If you find yourself going back to a particular UCS to create or edit objects,
you might consider saving the UCS for future use. To save a UCS that you
created, you use the UCSMAN command, which displays the UCS dialog box
(see Figure 2-8). The UCS dialog box lets you save and restore named UCSs
on the Named UCSs tab, customize the distance between the xy plane of the
six orthographic coordinate systems (top, bottom, front, back, left, and
right) on the Orthographic UCSs tab, and control some of the save and dis-
play settings for UCSs on the Settings tab.
In AutoCAD 2009, you can also use ViewCube to create and restore named
UCSs. ViewCube is a new modeless feature that allows you to not only work
with named UCSs but also identify and change the current orientation of a
model. I cover ViewCube more in Chapter 3 of this minibook.
The following steps create a UCS by rotating the UCS 45 degrees around the
z axis and then save it by using the UCS dialog box:
1. On the ribbon, choose click View tab➪UCS panel➪Z.
The command displays the prompt
Specify rotation angle about Z axis <90>:
2. Type 45 and press Enter.
The UCS is rotated 45 degrees. Now any object drawn at 0 degrees is
actually drawn at 45 degrees.
3. On the ribbon, click View tab➪UCS panel➪Named.
The UCS dialog box is displayed.
Figure 2-8:

box.

4. In the UCSs list, select Unnamed.
The Unnamed UCS is the current UCS in the drawing and is listed at the
very top of the list.
5. Right-click Unnamed and choose Rename from the shortcut menu.
An in-place editor is displayed that allows you to change the UCSs name.
6. Type a new name for the UCS and press Enter.
The Unnamed UCS is renamed with the name you entered.
7. Click OK.
The UCS dialog box closes and the UCS is saved in the drawing. To use a
saved UCS, open the UCS dialog box and then select the saved UCS from
the list and click Set Current.
Using the dynamic UCS feature
Setting up a UCS takes a bit of effort and can be distracting if you need to
create one just to draw an object on the side of a 3D object. AutoCAD allows
you to create a UCS on-the-fly by using the dynamic UCS feature. This feature
can save you a great deal of time and is easy to toggle on and off by clicking
the dynamic UCS (or DUCS) button on the status bar. For example, when
dynamic UCS is turned on, you can start the CYLINDER command and posi-
tion the crosshairs over one of the faces of a box to draw a hole in the box.
The face that is being tracked is highlighted, and when you click to start
drawing the cylinder, the UCS jumps to the face until you are finished with
the command. Figure 2-9 shows the use of the dynamic UCS in action.
Dynamic UCS is not available in AutoCAD LT 2009.

I
n this chapter, I immerse you into the world of 3D in AutoCAD as I explain
how to navigate and view 3D models. AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT offer a
number of ways to view 3D models. These include basic preset views as 
well as more sophisticated viewing tools, such as orbit and walk, which are
available only in AutoCAD. After you have a model displayed the way you
want, you can apply a visual style or a shade mode to make the objects
appear hidden or shaded, respectively, on-screen.
Expressing Your Point of View
AutoCAD offers what seems like an endless number of ways to view a 3D
model, while AutoCAD LT offers a basic set of 3D navigation tools for view-
ing a 3D model. I cover all the available 3D navigation tools in this section.
Using preset views
Both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT offer some standard preset views that can
help you view different sides of a 3D model quickly. The presets include
being able to view a 3D model from the top, left, and southeast. If the pre-
sets don’t offer what you need, you can use the Viewpoint Presets dialog
box to get a little more control over the viewpoint.
Specifying a standard view preset
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT have a total of ten preset views. Six of these
preset views are parallel (or orthographic) to the current UCS — top,
bottom, left, right, front, and back — and four are isometric views — 
southwest (SW) isometric, southeast (SE) isometric, northeast (NE) 
isometric, and northwest (NW) isometric. The presets are available in 
several ways:

Expressing Your Point of View
370
✦From the 3D Views submenu on the View menu on the menu bar or
menu browser
✦From the Preset Views node under the Views tree in the View Manager
dialog box
✦On the ribbon or the View toolbar, by clicking Home tab➪View
panel➪Views drop-down list
Select one of the presets to start the VIEW command and use the option that
matches the chosen preset.
The ViewCube allows you to set preset views as current by clicking one of its
corners, faces, or edges. I cover the ViewCube later in this chapter. It is not
available in AutoCAD LT.
Changing with the Viewpoint Presets dialog box
The Viewpoint Presets dialog box (see Figure 3-1) gives you more control
over the viewing angle than the preset views do. To display the Viewpoint
Presets dialog box, from the menu browser click View menu➪3D Views➪
Viewpoint Presets. To change the angle, select either the Absolute to WCS or
Relative to UCS option. Specify the angle from the x axis by entering a value
in the From: X Axis text box or by selecting the angle on the dial itself. After
you set the x axis, specify the angle from the xy (working) plane by entering
a value in the From: XY Plane text box or from the dial on the right. Values
above 0 allow you to look down on the model; values below 0 allow you to
look up at the model as if you were looking up at a building.

Chapter 3

371
Finding your way with the compass and tripod
The preset views and the Viewpoint Presets dialog box are nice, but they
don’t provide a visual way to set a viewpoint. The VPOINT command allows
you to see the current UCS via an axis tripod and a circular display known as
the compass in the upper-right corner of the drawing window (see Figure
3-2). This allows you to specify the angle from the x axis and xy plane like the
Viewport Presets dialog box does but is also visual and interactive. Although
changing the viewpoint is visually done on-screen rather than by using a
dialog box, it can still be a bit confusing. 
To select an angle above 0, keep the small crosshairs in the inner circle,
which represents a positive z axis (the outer circle represents a negative z
axis). Where the inner and outer circles meet is 0, or no change in the z axis
direction. The compass and tripod are the most advanced 3D navigation
tools in AutoCAD LT. But if you’re using AutoCAD, you’ll most likely never
want to use them, preferring the newer and better tools that I explain later in
this chapter.
Cameras
Cameras are similar to named views, with the exception that they have a
graphical representation in a model and can be updated via the Properties
palette. Along with using the Properties palette, you can also edit a camera’s
properties through the View Manager dialog box. The graphical representa-
tion of a camera is referred to as a glyph. Glyphs allow you to manipulate 
the object they represent (in this case a camera) by using standard modify
commands such as MOVE, COPY, and ERASE, along with grip editing.
AutoCAD LT does not support the creation or use of cameras. Cameras 
also do not appear in the drawing window when a drawing file containing
cameras is opened.
Figure 3-2:

Creating a camera
To create a camera, you use the CAMERA command. To start the CAMERA
command, do one of the following:
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click View menu➪Create Camera.
✦On the ribbon or the View toolbar, click Home tab➪View panel➪Create
Camera.
✦In the Tool Palettes window, click the Cameras palette and then one of
the camera tools.
As you create a camera, you are prompted for the location of the camera 
and a target point. After the camera is created, you can change its name,
location, height, target, lens, or clipping, or switch to the cameras view. 
After the camera is created, the glyph is displayed in the drawing.
You can control the display of camera glyphs in AutoCAD by using the
system variable CAMERAGLYPH. Set CAMERAGLYPH to 0 to turn off the 
display of camera glyphs, and 1 to turn on the display.
Adjusting the view of a camera
To adjust the view of a camera, you select its glyph in the drawing and 
then adjust it by using the grips that are displayed. The grips let you adjust
the distance between the camera and target, along with the lens length of
the camera. When a camera is selected, the Camera Preview dialog box 
(see Figure 3-3) should be displayed, which lets you see what the camera is
seeing without switching to the camera’s view. If the Camera Preview dialog
box isn’t displayed when you select a camera in the drawing, right-click and
select View Camera Preview on the shortcut menu.

Orbiting around a 3D Model
373
Perspective versus parallel
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT can display a 3D model in parallel view, which
makes a 3D model appear flat and without depth, or in a perspective view,
which makes a 3D model seem to disappear into the distance and have depth.
Figure 3-4 shows a rectangle displayed in both parallel and perspective view.
When you look at objects in real life, you see things in a perspective view. To
enable perspective view in a drawing, type PERSPECTIVE at the command
prompt and press Enter, and then type 1 and press Enter. Perspective view is
available only when a visual style or shade mode other than 2D wireframe is
active. We talk about visual styles and shade mode later in this chapter.
Orbiting around a 3D Model
AutoCAD comes with many commands that allow you to navigate around a
3D model. Being able to rotate the viewpoint around a 3D model allows you
to quickly see things from a different angle and make the necessary edits.
The ability to rotate the viewpoint around a 3D model is called orbiting, like
what planets do around the sun. Orbiting is done along a circular path; the
rotation point is different based on the orbit command you choose to use.
To access the 3D orbit commands, do one of the following:
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click View menu➪Orbit and then
click one of the Orbit commands.
✦On the ribbon or the Orbit toolbar, click Home tab➪View panel➪Orbit
flyout and then click one of the Orbit commands.
AutoCAD LT does not support the 3D orbit commands.
Table 3-1 lists the three 3D orbit commands available in AutoCAD.

Description
3DORBIT
Constrained Orbit sets the target to a stationary point at the 
center of the objects you are viewing when the 3DORBIT 
command starts. Dragging horizontally moves the camera 
along the current xy (working) plane, and dragging 
vertically moves the camera along the z axis.
3DFORBIT
Free Orbit sets the target of the view to the center of the 
displayed arcball. The arcball (see Figure 3-5) controls how 
the view is rotated around its center rather than the center 
of the objects you are viewing. Dragging inside the arcball 
allows you to freely rotate the model, whereas dragging 
on the outside of the arcball rolls the model perpendicular 
to the screen. Clicking and dragging in the left or right 
quadrants (small circles) causes the model to rotate around 
the vertical axis of the arcball, and clicking and dragging in 
the top or bottom quadrants (small circles) causes the 
model to rotate around the horizontal axis of the arcball.
3DCORBIT
Continuous Orbit is similar to Constrained Orbit in the way it 
works, except you can send the model into a continuous 
orbit that lasts until you stop it. 
While one of the 3D orbit commands (or any of the other 3D navigation 
commands that I mention in the next section) is active, you can right-click
and access the Navigation Modes menu (see Figure 3-6). This menu allows
you to switch between parallel and perspective projection modes, between
different visual styles, or even to other navigation commands without having 
to exit one command to start another. You can also switch to a different 
navigation command by pressing the number next to it in the Other
Navigation Modes submenu.

If you hold down the Shift key first and then press and hold down the middle
mouse button, you can temporarily switch to 3DORBIT. Pressing and holding
the middle mouse button and then pressing the Shift key temporarily places
you in orthogonal pan mode.
If the drawing contains a lot of objects, you can select a small set of the
objects to isolate them before starting one of the 3D orbit commands. This
can help with performance in larger drawings because only the selected
objects appear while the 3D orbit command is in use.
Navigating a 3D Model
AutoCAD offers other 3D navigation commands besides the 3D orbit com-
mands. Chapter 5 of Book I describes the ZOOM and PAN commands; both 
of these commands also have specific 3D versions, but you can still use
other zoom options such as window and extents. However, some additional
commands are specific for 3D navigation. These commands, listed in Table
3-2, make it feel like you are right in your drawing. The 3D navigation 
commands can be accessed from the following:
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click View➪Camera➪Walk and Fly
✦On the 3D Navigation toolbar, click Camera flyout➪Walk and Fly flyout.
AutoCAD LT does not support the 3D navigation commands listed in 
Table 3-2.

This makes it feel as though you are turning 
your head around in the drawing to view 
other objects while standing in a single spot.
3DFLY
Allows you to interactively change the view 
of the drawing as you “fly” through it. You 
leave the xy plane and feel as though you are 
above the drawing.
3DWALK
Allows you to interactively change the view 
of the drawing as you “walk” through it. You 
remain on the xy plane and feel as though 
you are walking through the drawing.
When using one of the 3D navigation commands, you can right-click and
choose a different navigation mode from the shortcut menu.
Hugging the Corners with the SteeringWheels
The SteeringWheels feature integrates several 2D and 3D navigation 
tools into a single user interface. I cover working with the 2D 
Navigation wheel, the only wheel in AutoCAD LT, in Chapter 3 of 
Book II. AutoCAD has three additional wheels, which contain 3D 
navigation tools:
✦View Object: Center a model in the drawing window, zoom in and 
out, or orbit around a model.
✦Tour Building: Move the viewpoint forward and backward, look around,
and change the elevation of the viewpoint up and down.
✦Full Navigation: Access most of the tools on the 2D Navigation, View
Object, and Tour Building wheels in addition to walking or flying 
through a model.

All the wheels offer the Rewind tool, which I describe in Chapter 3 of Book II.
To display one of the 3D-related wheels, start the NAVSWHEEL command 
and then right-click. From the menu, choose Full Navigation Wheel, or Basic
Wheels➪View Object Wheel or Tour Building Wheel. The 3D wheels can 
also be displayed in a smaller (or mini) version, which can be selected by
right-clicking and choosing one of the options that starts with Mini.
When using a tool from a 3D wheel, you’ll see indicators that display the 
current value and possible range of values along with tool messages that
help you with the type of input that is being requested to use the tool. Many
of the 3D navigation tools work similarly to their 3D command counterparts;
for example, the orbit and walk tools are similar to 3DORBIT and 3DWALK.
To find out more about the specific tools on the wheels, see AutoCAD’s
online Help. To display help specific to the wheels, right-click when a wheel
is displayed and choose Help from the shortcut menu. 
Cube with a View
AutoCAD comes with a new feature called the ViewCube. (The feature 
is not available in AutoCAD LT.) The ViewCube (see Figure 3-7) is an 
interactive modeless tool that provides visual feedback about the 
current viewpoint. It also allows you to set a preset view current, orbit 
the model, restore a named UCS, and define and restore the Home view 
of a model.
To change the view of the model by using the ViewCube, you click a corner, a
face, or an edge. Figure 3-8 shows what the ViewCube looks like after one of
the three different areas on the ViewCube is clicked. The faces, edges, and
corners allow you to switch to one of 26 preset views. In addition to clicking
the ViewCube to set a preset view, you can click and drag the ViewCube to
orbit the model. Dragging the ViewCube gives you more freedom in defining

the viewpoint of the model. When you click a face on the ViewCube to define
an orthographic view, you can click the roll arrows to rotate the view 90
degrees or you can click one of the adjacent face triangles to switch to the
adjacent orthographic view indicated by the triangle.
The Home view of a model is a new concept in AutoCAD 2009. It’s a special
view that you can define so you have a known reference view in the model.
The Home view can be used for the thumbnail preview of the drawing file
when it’s saved and can be restored from the ViewCube or SteeringWheels
shortcut menu. To define the Home view, select the view you want by using
the ViewCube or one of the other 3D navigation tools that AutoCAD offers,
and then right-click the ViewCube and choose Set Current View as Home. To
restore the Home view, right-click and choose Home, or click the Home icon.
You can use the Home view for the thumbnail when saving a drawing file by
clicking the Thumbnail Preview Settings button on the Open and Save tab of
the Options dialog box. Then select Use Home View in the Drawing section in
the Thumbnail Preview Settings dialog box; make sure the Save a Thumbnail
Preview Image option is also selected.
In addition to changing the view of a model, you can do the following:
✦Change the current projection mode by choosing Parallel, Perspective,
or Perspective with Ortho Faces. The Perspective with Ortho Faces
option uses perspective projection unless a face view is active, in 
which case parallel projection is used. The other two options work as 
I describe earlier in the chapter.
✦You can control the behavior and display of the ViewCube by using the
ViewCube Settings option. When the option is selected, the ViewCube
Settings dialog box is displayed.
Adding Color and Style to a 3D Model
Looking at drawings displayed in 2D and 3D wireframe can make it difficult
to visualize what is in there. AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT offer a few options 
to help you see what all those lines actually look like. AutoCAD uses visual

styles to display geometry so you only see the objects that are in front of
others. AutoCAD LT does not support visual styles but instead has a feature
called shade modes. Shade modes were available in releases of AutoCAD
prior to AutoCAD 2006 to hide faces that are beyond those closest to the 
current viewpoint.
Visual styles in AutoCAD
Visual styles allow you to see your drawing in a hidden, shaded, or semiren-
dered state. Visual styles are available from the Visual Styles Manager
palette or the Visual Styles panel on the Visualize tab of the ribbon. To 
display the Visual Style Manager palette (see Figure 3-9) you use the VISUAL-
STYLES command. To start the VISUALSTYLES command: From the menu
browser or menu bar, choose Tools menu➪Palettes➪Visual Styles. Double-
click one of the available visual styles to set it current. You can also make a
custom visual style and make changes to it by changing its properties in the
lower part of the palette. You can set a visual style current when drawing to
give you a sense of which lines you might want to snap to.
Figure 3-10 shows the Visual Styles (left) and Edge Effects (right) panels on
the Visualize tab of the ribbon. These panels contain a variety of controls
that allow you to change visual styles, enable x-ray mode to see through
faces, control how faces and edges are displayed, and even control the 
display of shadows in a scene. To find more about visual styles, see
AutoCAD’s online Help.

Shademode in AutoCAD LT
AutoCAD LT doesn’t support the use of visual styles, but you can do a few
things to get a similar effect when viewing a 3D model. AutoCAD LT offers a
command called SHADEMODE, which allows you to view a model in 2D wire-
frame or hidden line view. SHADEMODE is similar to a visual style in most
ways, except you can’t customize its appearance. AutoCAD LT also offers 
the SHADE command, which allows you to shade a 3D model based on the
colors that the objects are assigned, and you can use the HIDE command to
display a 3D model in a hidden line view. The SHADE and HIDE commands
are available from the View menu on the menu browser or menu bar. Type
SHADEMODE at the command prompt and then select the option you 
want to use.

N
ow that you know how to get around a drawing, it’s time to create
some objects. You start by creating 2D objects. (Yes, you read that
correctly: 2D objects.) Although the result you want is a 3D model, you don’t
have to create everything by using just 3D objects. Taking what you already
know about creating 2D objects and applying that knowledge to 3D model-
ing helps you feel more comfortable with using and working in 3D. AutoCAD
also provides some tools that help you create 2D objects from a 3D model
so you can generate the necessary shop drawings to get the model built.
At the end of this chapter, I cover some of the common 3D modify com-
mands to help position, rotate, mirror, and array 3D objects. Most of this
chapter applies to AutoCAD only (not AutoCAD LT) and is designed to 
give you an overview of the different commands that allow you to go from
2D to 3D and back again. (An entire book could be written on just working
with AutoCAD 3D alone, and actually has been: AutoCAD 2008 3D Modeling
Workbook For Dummies.) For more information on the commands in this
chapter, refer to AutoCAD’s online Help.
Before you read any farther, you’ll want to set the 3D Modeling workspace
current if it’s not already. To do so, on the status bar choose Workspace
Switching➪3D Modeling. The 3D Modeling workspace allows you to access
many of the 3D-related commands and settings from the ribbon.
Working with Regions
Regions are 2D objects that are created from closed shapes — or loops. A
loop is a set of objects such as lines and arcs that form a closed object but
are not necessarily closed objects themselves, such as circles, polylines, or
splines. You can create a region from polylines, lines, arcs, circles, elliptical

Working with Regions
382
arcs, ellipses, and splines. Regions can be great for creating complex areas
to hatch, and can be used to create 3D objects. You can obtain the centroid
(the center point of the mass or volume of a region), the moment of inertia
(the value used to calculate distributed loads), and other information about
a region by using the MASSPROP command, like you can with 3D solids. For
more information on the MASSPROP command, see the section “Getting
more information about regions,” later in this chapter.
Creating regions
Because regions are created from existing objects in a drawing, you first
must create the closed objects or loops and then use the REGION command
to generate a region from them. A region is created for each selected closed
object or loop. You can start the REGION command on the menu browser or
menu bar by clicking Draw menu➪Region, on the ribbon by clicking Home
tab➪Draw panel➪Region, or on the Draw toolbar by clicking the Region
button. An example of the REGION command follows, along with the objects
that were selected (see Figure 4-1):
Command: _region
Select objects: Select the closed objects or loops
Specify opposite corner: 8 found
Select objects: Press Enter
6 loops extracted.
6 Regions created.
When you use the REGION command (and some of the other commands 
covered in this chapter), the original objects that you select to create the
region or 3D object from are deleted automatically. To keep the original
objects from being deleted, set the DELOBJ system variable to a value of 0.
Modifying regions
Regions are interesting objects because they are no longer 2D objects, nor
are they 3D objects, so you modify them in a slightly different way. Although
regions are not 3D objects, you can use some of the 3D modify commands on
Figure 4-1:
Closed

regions.

Chapter 4
Moving from 
2D to 3D

383
them. If you want to remove a portion of a region with another region, you
don’t use the TRIM command; instead, you use the SUBTRACT command.
You can use the EXPLODE command to convert a region back to 2D objects.
Union
Union allows you to combine two or more regions into a single region. In 
this way, you can create complex 2D objects that can later be extruded to
create a 3D object. A great example of this is a metal plate that is used to
keep an object in place or the side panel of a desk. You can start the UNION
command on the menu browser or menu bar by clicking Modify menu➪
Solid Editing➪Union, on the ribbon by clicking Home tab➪Solid Editing
panel➪Boolean flyout➪Union, or on the Solid Editing toolbar by clicking the
Union button. After the UNION command is started, select the regions to
combine.
Subtract
Subtract removes a region from another region that it intersects or 
overlaps. This allows you to create holes, slots, or notches in regions 
before you extrude them to create a 3D object. You can start the SUBTRACT
command on the menu browser or menu bar by clicking Modify menu➪
Solid Editing➪Subtract, on the ribbon by clicking Home tab➪Solid Editing
panel➪Boolean flyout➪Subtract, or on the Solid Editing toolbar by clicking
the Subtract button. After the SUBTRACT command is started, select the
regions to subtract from and then select the regions to subtract.
Intersect
Intersect allows you to keep only the closed area where two regions overlap
or intersect. Using intersect is much more common when you are working
with 3D solids. You can start the INTERSECT command on the menu browser
or menu bar by clicking Modify menu➪Solid Editing➪Intersect, on the
ribbon by clicking Home tab➪Solid Editing panel➪Boolean flyout➪Intersect,
or on the Solid Editing toolbar by clicking the Intersect button. After the
INTERSECT command is started, select the regions you want to create a new
region from, based on where all the selected regions intersect each other.
Getting more information about regions
Regions are complex objects that you can use to construct 3D solids or 2D
objects for calculating additional information for a design, such as area and
perimeter. The MASSPROP command allows you to obtain more information
about a 2D region or 3D solid than what the LIST command displays. To start
the MASSPROP command from the menu browser or menu bar, click Tools
menu➪Inquiry➪Region/Mass Properties. An example of the MASSPROP 
command is

3D Polylines and Helixes
Although a line object is not commonly thought of as a 3D object, a line can
have a different starting and ending z coordinate value, which makes it a 3D
command. The 3DPOLY command allows you to draw 3D polylines, and the
HELIX command allows you to create 2D and 3D spirals. 3D polylines and
helixes, like line objects, can also have varying z coordinate values without
the need to change the current user coordinate system (UCS). For more
information on the UCS, see Book V, Chapter 2.
3D polyline
3D polylines are similar to their 2D counterparts, except they support only
straight segments and you can specify a different z coordinate value for the
start and endpoint of a segment. You use the 3DPOLY command to create a
3D polyline. You can start the 3DPOLY command on the menu browser or
menu bar by clicking Draw menu➪3D Polyline, on the ribbon by clicking
Home tab➪Draw panel➪3D Polyline, or on the Draw toolbar by clicking the
3D Polyline button.
Helix
You can use helixes to create 2D and 3D spirals, shown in Figure 4-2, which
might be used to represent springs, coils, or even doorstops. To create a 2D
helix, use a height value of 0. To create a helix (2D or 3D spiral) you use the
HELIX command. You can start the HELIX command on the menu browser or

Creating 3D Objects from 2D Objects
AutoCAD’s roots started with 2D drafting. That continues to be the primary
focus of the program, but Autodesk has shifted to making sure that 3D is a
key part of the program as well. Because AutoCAD started off being a 2D
drafting package, you can take your knowledge of 2D drafting to create 3D
objects with it. This section discusses many of the different commands that
allow you to convert existing 2D objects into 3D objects. Some work with 
2D profiles, whereas others might require you to first create a region or
some sort of closed object. Everything in this section applies to AutoCAD
only, with the exception of the Thickness section.
Thickness
Thickness is a property of most 2D objects, such as lines and circles. When
you change the thickness of a 2D object, you are creating a surface out of the
object, or a set of surfaces. These surfaces hide objects behind them, unlike
wireframe models. If you add thickness to a circle, a cylinder is created that
is capped on the top and bottom. Changing the thickness of a pline that 
has a width is a quick way to create a 3D wall. Thickness is also a system
variable that can be set by typing THICKNESS at the command prompt and
entering a new value. The current value of the THICKNESS system variable 
is assigned to each new object that is created.
Extrude
Extrude allows you to take an open or a closed 2D object and create a solid
or surface out of it. When you extrude a closed 2D object such as a polyline,
a spline, an ellipse, a circle, or a region, you create a solid. If you extrude an
open 2D object such as a polyline, a spline, a line, an arc, or an elliptical arc,
Figure 4-2:
Helixes can
be used to
create
springs.

Creating 3D Objects from 2D Objects
386
you create a surface. Figure 4-3 shows the results of extruding an open and a
closed object. You can extrude a face on a solid by holding down the Ctrl key
and selecting the face when asked to select objects to extrude.
After you select the objects or faces you want to extrude, you specify a 
distance and direction to create the extrusion in. During the extrusion, you
can select a path to extrude along, which can be a 2D object or an edge of a
solid or surface. You can start the EXTRUDE command on the menu browser
or menu bar by clicking Draw menu➪Modeling➪Extrude, on the ribbon by
clicking Home tab➪3D Modeling panel➪Extrude, or on the Modeling toolbar
by clicking the Extrude button.
If you want to keep the original object that is used to create the extruded
object, set the DELOBJ system variable to a value of 0.
Loft
Loft allows you to create a solid or surface based on a series of specified
cross sections. The cross sections are used to define the profile that is 
generated, and you must use a minimum of two cross sections for the loft. 
If you use open objects for the cross sections, the resulting loft is a surface; 
if you use closed objects for the cross sections, the resulting loft is a solid.
You can loft objects along a path by using guides or just the selected cross
sections (see Figure 4-4). You can start the LOFT command on the menu
browser or menu bar by clicking Draw menu➪Modeling➪Loft, on the ribbon
by clicking Home tab➪3D Modeling panel➪Loft, or on the Modeling toolbar
by clicking the Loft button.

387
Sweep
Sweep is similar to Loft except you use a single cross section rather than 
two or more. The cross section defines the generated profile. If you use an
open object for the cross section, the resulting sweep is a surface; if you 
use a closed object for the cross section, the resulting sweep is a solid. 
You sweep the selected objects along a path (see Figure 4-5). You can start
the SWEEP command on the menu browser or menu bar by clicking Draw
menu➪Modeling➪Sweep, on the ribbon by clicking Home tab➪3D Modeling
panel➪Sweep, or on the Modeling toolbar by clicking the Sweep button.
Revolve
Revolve allows you to create a solid or surface based on selected objects
and a specified axis that they should revolve around. If you use open
objects, the resulting revolve is a surface; if you use closed objects, the
resulting revolve is a solid. You revolve the selected objects around an axis
and specify the angle at which you want the objects to be revolved (see
Figure 4-6). You can start the REVOLVE command on the menu browser by
clicking Draw menu➪Modeling➪Revolve, on the ribbon by clicking Home
tab➪3D Modeling panel➪Revolve, or on the Modeling toolbar by clicking 
the Revolve button.

Creating 2D Objects from 3D Objects
AutoCAD allows you to make the transition from 2D to 3D without having to
completely abandon what you already know about 2D drafting. Wouldn’t it
be nice to be able to create a 2D representation of a 3D model that you spent
numerous hours creating? You’re in luck: AutoCAD comes with commands
that allow you to take a 3D model and generate a 2D representation of a
given view. After you have a 2D representation of the 3D model, you can then
add any dimensions and notes necessary for construction or manufacturing.
Flatshot
Flatshot allows you to create a block that contains 2D objects based on the
current view of a 3D model. By creating the 3D model first, you can create a
block that contains only the objects that are visible in a view, or include the
obscured lines in a different color or linetype (see Figure 4-7). Flatshot looks
for all 3D objects in the current view and ignores all 2D objects. To start the
FLATSHOT command, on the ribbon, click Home tab➪Solid Editing panel’s
title bar➪Flatshot.
Section Plane
With Section Plane, you can cut a 3D solid without actually altering the
object itself to generate a 2D or 3D object based on the geometry along the
defined plane (see Figure 4-8). This allows you to quickly create different
views of a model to help manufacture it or even assemble it. Unlike Flatshot,
a Section Plane can go through an object and generate a 2D representation 
of the objects along the Section Plane.

Book V
Chapter 4
Moving from

Creating 2D Objects from 3D Objects
389
To create a 2D or 3D representation of the objects along a plane, you first
start the SECTIONPLANE command on the menu browser or menu bar by
clicking Draw menu➪Modeling➪Section Plane, or on the ribbon by clicking
Home tab➪Solid Editing panel’s title bar➪Section Plane.
After the Section Plane has been created, you have various options to control
how the objects around the Section Plane are displayed. The display options
can be accessed from the right-click shortcut menu or the Properties palette.
To generate a 2D or 3D object from the Section Plane, you use the Generate
Section/Elevation dialog box, which you display by clicking the section plane
and choosing Generate 2D/3D Section from the shortcut menu.
Solid Draw, Solid View, and Solid Profile
Three older commands called Solid Draw (SOLDRAW), Solid View
(SOLVIEW), and Solid Profile (SOLPROF) work similarly to the Flatshot
(FLATSHOT) and Section Plane (SECTIONPLANE) commands. These 
three commands allow you to generate views of 3D models, but they work
only in a layout with viewports. Solid Profile allows you to create a profile 
of a 3D object out of 2D objects, which can be helpful if you want to create
an exploded view of a part for an illustration guide.
Solid View and Solid Draw are used with each other. You use Solid View to
create a viewport and a specific set of layers; after the viewport is created,
you display the 3D objects in the viewport that you want to convert to 2D
objects with the Solid Draw command. Start the Solid Draw command and
select the viewport. All hidden objects are placed on a specific layer along
with other objects and layers that are created from the command (see 
Figure 4-9). To start the commands on the menu browser or menu bar, click
Draw menu➪Modeling➪Setup➪Drawing, View, or Profile. On the ribbon,
click Home tab➪3D Modeling panel’s title bar➪Solid Draw, Solid View, or
Solid Profile.

3D Modify Commands
Meshes, surfaces, and solids that make up 3D models can be modified 
by using all the modify commands that you already know, such as ERASE,
MOVE, and ROTATE. However, AutoCAD also offers some modify commands
that are designed specifically for working in 3D. These specialized 3D 
commands can be used on meshes, solids, surfaces, and even 2D objects.
You can locate all these commands on the menu browser or menu bar by
clicking Modify menu➪3D Operations, or on the ribbon by clicking Home
tab➪Modify panel.
3D Move
The 3D Move command allows you to move selected objects along the xy
(working) plane and in the z direction. This command uses what is called 
a grip tool to allow you to restrict or constrain movement along an axis 
(see Figure 4-10). The command prompts are identical to the MOVE com-
mand, so using the 3D Move command should feel familiar. You can start 
the 3DMOVE command on the menu browser or menu bar by clicking 
Modify menu➪3D Operations➪3D Move, on the ribbon by clicking Home
tab➪Modify panel➪3D Move, or on the Modeling toolbar by clicking the 
3D Move button.

3D Rotate
The 3D Rotate command allows you to rotate selected objects along the x, y,
or z axis. Like the 3D Move command, the 3D Rotate command uses a grip
tool to allow you to restrict or constrain the rotation along an axis (see
Figure 4-11). The command prompts are similar to the ROTATE command,
with a few slight differences: You need to pick an axis for rotation, and 
then a start and end angle rather than just a rotation angle. You can start 
the 3DROTATE command on the menu browser or menu bar by clicking
Modify menu➪3D Operations➪3D Rotate, on the ribbon by clicking Home
tab➪Modify panel➪3D Rotate, or on the Modeling toolbar by clicking the 
3D Rotate button.
Align
The Align command can be used to align 2D and 3D objects based on one,
two, or three pairs of points. Based on the number of point pairs that you
select and how they are selected, the Align command might move or rotate
or both move and rotate the selected objects into place. You start the ALIGN
command on the menu browser or menu bar by clicking Modify menu➪3D
Operations➪Align.
3D Align
The 3D Align command is an improved version of the ALIGN command that
includes some additional options, including the ability to copy the selected
objects instead of just moving and rotating them, and the ability to use
dynamic UCS with the command. You can start the 3DALIGN command on
the menu browser or menu bar by clicking Modify menu➪3D Operations➪3D
Align, on the ribbon by clicking Home tab➪Modify panel➪3D Align, or on the
Modeling toolbar by clicking the 3D Align button.

3D Mirror
The 3D Mirror command allows you to mirror objects along the xy plane like
the standard MIRROR command does. But you can also specify the mirror
plane by using a number of additional methods to define it: by three points,
an existing object in the drawing, a previously defined mirror plane, the 
z axis, the current view, the xy plane, the yz plane, and the zx plane. The 
three-point option is the most common and is the default option. You can
start 3DMIRROR command on the menu browser or menu bar by clicking
Modify menu➪3D Operations➪3D Mirror, or on the ribbon by clicking Home
tab➪Modify panel➪3D Mirror.
3D Array
The 3D Array command allows you to array objects along the xy plane 
(rows and columns) like the ARRAY command does, but it also allows you to
array objects in the z direction (levels). You can create both rectangular and
polar arrays with the 3D Array command just like you can with the ARRAY
command. The 3D Array command doesn’t use a nice dialog box like the
ARRAY command does, so entering the correct values can be hard the first
few times until you get used to the prompts. You can start the 3DARRAY
command by clicking Modify menu➪3D Operations➪3D Array, on the ribbon
by clicking Home tab➪Modify panel➪3D Array, or on the Modeling toolbar
by clicking the 3D Array button.

I
n the previous chapter, I covered many of the commands that allow you
to take the knowledge that you already have about 2D drafting and apply
it to 3D modeling. In this chapter, you discover many of the 3D commands
that allow you to create and edit 3D objects. AutoCAD allows you to create
3D objects known as primitives. Primitives are basic objects such as boxes,
cones, and spheres that you can use to create complex objects. You also
find out about additional modifying commands that are used to manipulate
3D solids.
Creating Solid Primitives
AutoCAD offers a pretty good variety of primitive 3D objects that you can
use to create complex models. The primitive objects help to form the foun-
dation of 3D modeling in AutoCAD: You can combine primitives together or
even manipulate a primitive so that its edges are filleted, to shell or hollow
out the inside of a 3D solid, and much more. Table 5-1 lists the commands
that are used to create solid primitives.

Polysolid
A polysolid is similar to a 2D polyline, except it has a single uniform width
and height when it is created. Polysolids are great for creating 3D walls 
when making a conceptual model of a building (see Figure 5-1) or for

modeling rectangular duct work. To start the POLYSOLID command, use one
of the methods in Table 5-1. After you start the POLYSOLID command, you 
can draw a polyline-like object that allows you to create both straight and
curved segments. If you already have lines, arcs, and polylines in your 
drawing, you are able to convert those to solids with the Object option 
of the POLYSOLID command. You are also able to specify the height, width,
and justification for the new solid object.
Box
A box is a six-sided object that is either a cube or a 3D rectangle. A box can
be used for virtually anything from a table (see Figure 5-2) to a door or even
a building in the background of a conceptual model. To start the BOX com-
mand, use one of the methods in Table 5-1. After specifying the first corner
or the center of the box, you can then finish defining the base of the box by
selecting the opposite corner, by creating a cube, or by defining its length.
Based on the option you select, you may need to define the box’s height.

Wedge
A wedge is half a box diagonally from an upper edge to a lower edge (essen-
tially a box that has a height of 0 on one edge). A wedge might be useful 
for creating a ramp, a roof slope, or even a slice of chocolate cake. Figure 5-3
shows some of the different sizes of wedges that can you can create with the
WEDGE command. To start the WEDGE command, use one of the methods 
in Table 5-1. After specifying the first corner or the center of the wedge, 
you can then finish defining the base of the wedge by selecting the opposite
corner, by creating a cube, or by defining its length. Based on the option
selected, you may need to define the wedge’s height.
Cone
A cone is an object with a circular base that has either a point or a flat top.
The base of a cone can be larger than its top and even be elliptical rather
than circular. You might use a cone for a handle or pull, a cup, or a planter.
Figure 5-4 shows some of the sizes and types of cones that you can create
with the CONE command. To start the CONE command, use one of the 
methods in Table 5-1. After specifying the center of the cone’s base, you
specify the radius or diameter of the base and then its height.

Sphere
A sphere is a full circular object that is created from the center of the object.
The sphere is one of two types of 3D solids that are created half above and
half below the current xy (working) plane (see Figure 5-5). Torus (which I 
discuss later in this chapter in the “Torus” section) is the other type of 3D
solid created above and below the current xy (working) plane. To start the
SPHERE command, use one of the methods in Table 5-1. After specifying the
center of the sphere, you specify its radius or diameter.
Cylinder
A cylinder is a circle or an ellipse with height and is commonly created 
from the center of the object. Cylinders can be used to represent a variety 
of features in a model, like the legs of a table or chair, glasses, or a shaft for 
a gear. Figure 5-6 shows some of the different sizes and types of cylinders
that can be created with the CYLINDER command. To start the CYLINDER
command, use one of the methods in Table 5-1. After specifying the center 
of the cylinder’s base, you specify the radius or diameter of the base and
then its height.

Torus
A torus is a 3D tubular object, similar to a cake donut, which is created from
the center of the object. The torus, like the sphere, is created half above 
and half below the current xy (working) plane (see Figure 5-7). To start the
TORUS command, use one of the methods in Table 5-1. After specifying the
center of the torus, you specify its radius or diameter, and then the radius 
or diameter of the tube.
Pyramid
A pyramid is similar to a cone, except rather than a circular base, it has a
polygon-shaped base that can have from 3 to 32 sides and either a point or a
flat top with the same number of sides as the base. You might use a pyramid
for the top of a building, the base of a street sign, or even a light fixture.
Figure 5-8 shows some of the sizes and shapes of pyramids that you can
create with the PYRAMID command. To start the PYRAMID command, use
one of the methods in Table 5-1. After you specify the center or the edge of
the pyramid’s base, you specify the radius or use the inscribed option, and
then its height.

Editing Solids

Editing Solids
You can edit a solid in many ways, and some of these ways are not always
easy to recognize. AutoCAD allows you to select a solid and use grip editing
to modify certain characteristics of a solid, perhaps its height or base 
size. Along with being able to edit solids directly with grips, you can also
manipulate faces and edges of a solid with the SOLIDEDIT command and 
by using the Ctrl key when selecting objects. You can edit a solid in many
other ways, such as using the TRIM and FILLET commands.
Solid editing
The SOLIDEDIT command allows you to modify a face, an edge, or the 
entire body of a 3D solid. Based on how you want to edit a 3D solid, different
options are available. Many of the options that are part of the SOLIDEDIT
command are on the Solid Editing toolbar, the flyouts on the Solid Editing
panel of the Home tab on the ribbon, or the Solid Editing submenu of the
Modify menu on the menu browser or menu bar.
Table 5-2 lists the options of the SOLIDEDIT command and their uses.

such as lines and arcs.
Face, Extrude
Allows you to extrude a selected face away or into the 
3D solid that it belongs to.
Face, Move
Allows you to move a selected face on a 3D solid. This 
works great for moving holes or notches in a face.
Face, Offset

created for each selected face.
—
Face, mAterial Allows you to select faces on a 3D solid 
and apply a material to them.
Body, Imprint
Imprints a 2D or 3D object onto a 3D solid. The object 
to be imprinted must intersect one or more faces of 
the 3D solid that it is to be imprinted on. After the 
object has been imprinted onto the solid, you can then 
extrude the new face that is created if the imprinted 
object creates a closed area on the 3D solid.
Body, cLean
Scrubs the 3D solid and cleans up any redundant 
edges, vertices, and unused geometry.
Body, seParate solids
Creates separate 3D solid objects based on any dis
jointed volumes of a 3D solid; this does not separate 
Boolean objects with a single volume.
Body, Shell
Hollows out a 3D solid based on a specified wall 
thickness. A positive offset distance creates the shell 
to the inside of the perimeter; a negative value creates 
the shell to the outside of the perimeter.
Body, Check
Performs a validation on the 3D solid object to 
determine whether it is valid with ShapeManager.
Using grips to edit 3D solids
Grips are a powerful way to edit objects such as lines and arcs. You can also
use grips to edit some of the characteristics of a 3D solid after it has been
created in a drawing. To edit a 3D solid by using grips, select the 3D solid
with no active command and then select the grip you want to use. Some
grips allow you to change the overall size of the 3D solid, whereas others
allow you to change part of the 3D solid such as its base or top in the case 
of a cone. Figure 5-9 shows a cone selected and its grips displayed.

Book V
Chapter 5
Working with
Solids
Editing Solids
401
Starting with AutoCAD 2007, grip editing was greatly improved for editing 
3D solids. In prior releases, you could use grips only to move 3D solids, but
now you can modify a 3D solid after it’s been created. The Properties palette
also allows you to edit the properties of a 3D solid after it’s been created in 
a drawing.
Complex solids
3D solids can be combined to form a complex object by using the UNION
command. Along with being able to union 3D solids, you can also subtract
3D solids from a 3D solid with the SUBTRACT command. A 3D solid can 
also be created based on the intersection of two or more 3D solids with the
INTERSECT command. For more information on these commands, see
Chapter 4 of this minibook and the online Help system.
Filleting and chamfering
3D solids, just like 2D objects, can be filleted and chamfered. You use the
FILLET and CHAMFER commands that you’re already familiar with. Figure
5-10 shows a solid that has had its edges filleted and chamfered. To remove 
a fillet or a chamfer from a solid, you use the Delete Faces option of the
SOLIDEDIT command.

Editing Solids
402
Slice
At times, you may want only a portion of the 3D solid for your model. In
these cases, you can use the SLICE command. You can slice a 3D solid by
using a planar object such as a circle, an ellipse, a 2D polyline, or a surface.
You can keep both halves of the solid after it has been sliced, or whichever
side you want to keep. Figure 5-11 shows a solid that has been sliced in half.
You can start the SLICE command on the menu browser or menu bar by
clicking Modify menu➪3D Operations➪Slice, or on the ribbon by clicking
Home tab➪Solid Editing panel’s title bar➪Slice. After you specify the 3D
solid to slice, you specify the axis or object you want to use as the cutting
plane and then decide which part of the resulting object to keep.

fter you understand how to navigate, visualize, create, and edit 3D solid
or surface models, you’re ready to take your 3D model through the
process of being rendered. Rendering allows you to visually present a concept
to clients so they have an idea of what the final product will look like when it
is manufactured or built. Hidden line and shaded views can help the client
visualize a 3D model, but they lack the depth and realism that can really sell a
concept. Before you generate a rendering, you add lights, materials, and a
background to your 3D model. These visuals all help bring realism to a 3D
model by making it look as much as possible like the final product. This chap-
ter applies to AutoCAD only (sorry AutoCAD LT users) and is designed to be
an overview of lights, materials, backgrounds, and rendering a model. For
more information on these topics, refer to AutoCAD’s online Help system.
Lighting a Scene
Lighting is a key to making your model — also known as a scene — look
realistic because it generates variations of color in your model. Objects clos-
est to the light source appear brighter and objects farther from the light
source appear darker, giving your model depth. This is what happens in real
life with light that comes from the sun or from a light bulb. AutoCAD offers
three distinct types of lights: default lights, user lights (point, spotlight, web,
and distant), and sunlight. All of these types of lights, except the default
lights, can cast shadows. To help manage the creation and editing of lights,
you use the Lights, Sun, and Time & Location panels on the ribbon, the Sun
Properties palette, and the Lights in Model palette.

Lighting a Scene
404
Default lights
Prior to AutoCAD 2007 there was a single default light, which always shone
in the direction of the current view. Since AutoCAD 2007, there has been the
option to use two default lights to help bring the level of lighting up and to
balance the lighting on each side of the model. Default lighting does not cast
shadows, so you should not use it for the final render, but it might be good
enough for generating conceptual renderings. You do have some control
over the brightness and contrast of the default lighting with the slider con-
trols that are available when the Lights panel on the ribbon is expanded (see
Figure 6-1).
The DEFAULTLIGHTINGTYPE system variable controls whether you use one
or two default distant lights. A value of 0 indicates to AutoCAD that one
default light should be used, while a value of 1 indicates that two default
lights should be used. Default lighting is enabled when the DEFAULTLIGHTING
system variable is set to a value of 1.
User lights
User lights are lights that you add to a scene. When you place user lights in a
scene, you need to disable the default lights that AutoCAD automatically cre-
ates when a drawing is open. AutoCAD supports two classifications of lights:
generic and photometric. Generic lights give you more flexibility to deter-
mine how light is emitted from a user defined light, but photometric lights
make it easier to represent lighting that you find in the real world. The
LIGHTINGUNITS system variable determines whether generic or photometric
lights are used when creating and modifying lights. When LIGHTINGUNITS is
set to 0, generic lights are used. When LIGHTINGUNITS is set to 1 or 2, photo-
metric lights are in use; 1 indicates American lighting units and 2 indicates
International lighting units.
User lights come in four distinct types of lights:
✦Point light: A point light emits light in all directions, but the light decays
or falls off the farther you get from the light. The falloff defines at what

ribbon.

Book V
Chapter 6

405
point no more light is emitted; by defining the falloff value of the light,
you can reduce rendering time. You can think of a point light as similar
to a candle or a lamp. Figure 6-2 shows four objects illuminated by 
a single point light. Point lights can be created with or without a 
target location. You create point lights by using the POINTLIGHT and
TARGETPOINT commands.
✦Spotlight: A spotlight emits light in a specific direction in a cone shape
and allows you to define the hotspot — the brightest part of the light —
and the falloff of the light. A spotlight is like track lighting, recessed
lighting, or a flashlight. Figure 6-3 shows four objects illuminated by a
single spotlight. Spotlights can be created with or without a target loca-
tion. You use the SPOTLIGHT and FREESPOT commands to create spot-
lights.
✦Weblight: A weblight is a cross between a point and spotlight, but a weblight
provides light distribution like you would find in the real world. Web
lights always attenuate or support light falloff. One thing that makes
weblights different from the other types of lights is that you can use
them Web files containing photometric data provided by various lighting
vendors. Figure 6-4 shows four objects illuminated by a single weblight.
Weblights can be created with or without a target location. You create
weblights by using the WEBLIGHT and FREEWEB commands.

✦Distant light: A distant light emits light in a specific direction but does-
n’t have a hotspot or a falloff like a point light, spotlight, or weblight. A
distant light is like the sun because it emits light all over every object
that it’s exposed to, so it’s great for backdrop lighting that comes from
behind a camera to fill a room with nondirect light. Figure 6-5 shows four
objects illuminated by a single distant light. You use the DISTANTLIGHT
command to create a distant light.
Don’t use a distant light when using photometric lighting. If you decide to ignore
AutoCAD’s warning, be sure to turn down the intensity factor of the light.
When you add your first user-defined light to a scene, you’re prompted by a
task dialog box asking you to disable default lighting if it’s not already dis-
abled. Click Turn Off the Default Lighting command link to disable default
lighting. You can toggle the use of default lighting on the ribbon by clicking
Visualize tab➪Lights panel➪Default Lighting.
You can use the light commands that I previously mention in this section 
to create lights or you can use the LIGHT command. You can start the 
LIGHT command on the ribbon by clicking Visualize tab➪Lights panel➪
Lights flyout, or on the menu browser or menu bar by clicking View menu➪
Render➪Light and then one of the available options. After a light has been
added to the scene, you can modify it with the Properties palette and by
using grip editing.

Point lights, spotlights, and weblights can be selected and edited directly in
a scene because a glyph is displayed to show where the light is located.
Distant lights do not have associated glyphs. (A glyph is a nonprinting object
displayed in a scene that enables you to modify an object that is not part of
the actual model, such as a light or a camera.)
You can control the display of glyphs for lights by using the LIGHTGLYPHDISPLAY
system variable. A value of 0 turns off the display of light glyphs, and a value of 1
displays light glyphs. You can also expand the Lights panel on the Visualize tab of
the ribbon and click Light Glyphs.
If the scene is complex or you need to select a distant light in the scene, you
need to use the Lights in Model palette (see Figure 6-6). The Lights in Model
palette allows you to select, delete, and access the Properties palette for
editing the selected light(s). To display the Lights in Model palette, use the
LIGHTLIST command. You can start the command on the menu browser or
menu bar by clicking Tools menu➪Palettes➪Lights, on the ribbon by clicking
View tab➪3D Palettes panel➪Lights in Model, or on the Lights toolbar by
clicking the Light List button.
The LIGHTSINBLOCKS system variable controls whether lights in blocks are
used when rendering. When LIGHTSINBLOCKS is set to 0, lights in a block
are disabled and not used when rendering. A value of 1 indicates to AutoCAD
that lights in blocks should participate in the rendering process.
Sunlight
The ability to add light that is similar to sunlight is great for outdoor scenes
or for indoor scenes with light coming in through a window. Sunlight is con-
trolled through the Sun Properties palette (see Figure 6-7) and the
Geographic Location dialog box (see Figure 6-8). Both interfaces allow you to
designate the position of the sun based on the city that your scene is nearest
to in the physical world, or at a specific latitude and longitude. You can also
designate the northern direction of the scene to make sure that light is emit-
ting on the scene as it would after it was built.

Getting the Right Look with Materials
Materials help to give your objects that special touch of realism, whether
they’re made up of metal, glass, plastic, or wood. Materials allow you to make
the objects in a scene appear more convincing to the viewer. The MATERIALS
command is used to display the Materials palette (see Figure 6-9), which allows
you to create and edit materials based on a variety of properties such as trans-
parency, shininess, or simply a color. After the material is created, you then
apply it to the objects in your scene. Here are the three ways you can associate
a material to objects in a scene:
✦Materials by Layer: Materials can be assigned to objects globally through-
out a scene by assigning the material to a layer. Use the MATERIALATTACH
command to assign a material to a layer in the scene.
✦Materials by Object: Materials can be assigned to individual objects in
the scene by using the MATERIALASSIGN command and selecting the
object or objects that you want to assign the material to or by changing
the Material property of an object through the Properties palette.
Figure 6-9:

palette.

Setting Up a Backdrop

✦Materials by Face: Materials can be assigned to an individual face of a 3D
solid by holding down the Ctrl key while using the MATERIALASSIGN com-
mand, or by using the SOLIDEDIT command and assigning a material, using
the Material option under the Face option.
Setting Up a Backdrop
Backgrounds allow you to fill what looks like empty space beyond the 3D
model in your scene. The background of a named view can be defined as a
solid color, a gradient that consists of two or three colors, an image file, or a
sky with a sun (only available when using photometric lighting). To set the
background of a named view, change the Background Override property of
the view in View Manager. To find more about working with named views,
see Chapter 3 of Book II.
In View Manager, select the view whose background you want to change from
the Views tree. You can only select views that are under the Model Views and
Layout Views nodes. Next, under the General section, select the Background
Override property. Then select the Background Override drop-down list and
choose Solid, Gradient or Image to display the Background dialog box (see
Figure 6-10) or Sun & Sky to display the Adjust Sun & Sky Background dialog
box (see Figure 6-11). Specify the desired options in the dialog box and click
OK. To set the view current and use the new background, select the view from
the Views tree and click Set Current. When you exit the dialog box, the back-
ground is displayed along with the view that was selected.
With AutoCAD 2009 you can, once again, type BACKGROUND at the command
prompt and press Enter to display the Background dialog box. This option was
removed a few releases ago and has been reintroduced in this release.

Rendering the Final Scene
After you create your 3D model, put lights in the scene, create and apply
materials, and put a background in the current view, you’re ready to put it all
together through the rendering process. During the rendering process,
AutoCAD gathers all the materials and applies them to the objects and faces
of your 3D model and calculates the light emitted in the scene and shadows.
Rendering takes place by default in the Render Window dialog box (see
Figure 6-12). You can start the RENDER command on the menu browser or
menu bar by clicking View menu➪Render➪Render, on the ribbon by clicking
Output tab➪Render panel➪Render, or on the Render toolbar by clicking the
Render button.
Instead of rendering the entire scene to the Render Window, you can use the
RENDERCROP command and specify the part of the current view that you
want to render. This is a great way to test the lighting and shadows in a spe-
cific area of a scene without having to render everything. The rendering hap-
pens directly in the current viewport. You can start the RENDERCROP
command on the ribbon by clicking Output tab➪Render panel➪Region.
When you create a rendering, you can select from five render presets to help
speed up the rendering process. A render preset can be selected from the
drop-down list on the Render panel of the Output tab on the ribbon. Render
presets range from quick renderings with draft settings, which makes your
objects appear grainy, to a presentation-quality preset, which can significantly
increase rendering times while increasing the quality of the rendered output.

If the render presets don’t offer the look you want, you can choose Manage
Render Presets from the render presets drop-down list. Then you can create a
copy of one of the render presets and customize it the way you want to. You
can also use the Advanced Render Settings palette (see Figure 6-13) to cus-
tomize and create a custom render preset. When you have the rendering set-
tings that you want, you can then output the rendering to an image file from
the Advanced Render Settings palette or the Render Window dialog box.

In addition to rendering to a still image with the RENDER command, you can
create a basic walkthrough of your model by using the ANIPATH command. 
The ANIPATH command displays the Motion Path Animation dialog box, which
allows you to create a camera that moves around a fixed point or follows a
path. As the command hints by its name, you can create an animation that can
give your presentation an added edge over still images. When you create the
animation, you can choose from the AVI, MPEG, and WMV file formats, the size
and length of the animation, and the visual style that should be used. You can
start the ANIPATH command on the menu browser or menu bar by clicking
View menu➪Motion Path Animations, on the ribbon by clicking Tools tab➪
Animations panel➪Animation Motion Path. To find out more about creating 
animations and rendering, see AutoCAD’s online Help system.

T
his minibook of the AutoCAD 2009 & AutoCAD LT 2009 All-in-One Desk
Reference For Dummies takes a look at creating and managing reusable con-
tent. Reusable content is content that needs to be created only once and then
can be used in many different drawings. The ability to reuse content was a huge
advantage for those early drafters that dared to venture into the unknown
world of CAD so many years ago. If you’ve ever had the pleasure of drafting on a
board, you may have used plastic templates for things such as circles, furniture
in a house plan, and mechanical fasteners. Those plastic templates allowed you
to draw the same objects over and over without drawing them completely from
scratch each time. As you will find out, blocks are AutoCAD’s equivalent to plas-
tic drafting templates, except they are much more powerful.
Working with Reusable Content
AutoCAD allows you to create geometry templates called blocks. A block is
an object that is made up of many different objects and given a name to ref-
erence when you want to place the block in a drawing. Blocks are great for
providing a consistent look to your drawings. You may have already used a
block in your drawings for a border that contains a project name, date, and
other information that relates to a particular drawing. Blocks can be defined
with static or dynamic geometry, and contain elements called attributes,
which can be used to store static text or allow users to enter their own text
value. Attributes allow you to assign a varying text value that identifies a
feature of the physical object that the block represents or to store informa-
tion about the drawing. An attribute can have a different value for each
block with the same name inserted into a drawing. Attributes are often used
to store costing, descriptions, room numbers, and other information that
you might want to extract out of a drawing. The extracted attribute informa-
tion can be imported into an external application, such as Microsoft Excel,
or even placed on a drawing as a table object.

Creating Blocks
418
Blocks are not the only form of reusable content in AutoCAD. AutoCAD can
reference entire drawings and other files into a drawing, called external refer-
encing. When a drawing file is referenced into another drawing, it is referred
to as an xref. Xrefs allow you to share drawings with others who may need to
ensure that their drawings match up with yours. For example, you can share
a floor plan with the building systems contractor and the landscaper at one
time. If the floor plan is used as an xref, the next time the drawing is opened
by the contractors, the updates are displayed (of course, the contractors
need the updated drawing file). AutoCAD is also capable of referencing
raster images and DWF, DWFx, and DGN files.
Drawings often display schedules. Sometimes drafters create this information
in a word processor or spreadsheet program. AutoCAD allows you to copy and
paste content from Windows-based applications through the use of the
Windows Clipboard, but doing so causes the information to become static.
AutoCAD can keep some of this information dynamic through the use of Object
Linking and Embedding (OLE).
Being able to reuse content has advantages, but being able to access that
content quickly makes it even more valuable. AutoCAD provides two inter-
faces that allow you to organize and access content quickly; these interfaces
are called DesignCenter and Tool Palettes window. For more information on
DesignCenter and the Tool Palettes window, see Chapter 4 of this minibook.
Creating Blocks
Creating a block isn’t all that difficult after you have the objects created that
you want to combine into a block. Blocks can contain the same drawing and
annotation objects that you add to a drawing file, such as rectangles, circles,
arcs, dimensions and multiline text. Objects that are part of a block look just
like individual objects drawn in a drawing.
AutoCAD allows you to create a block directly from the objects in a drawing
without the need of doing much more. To create a block, you use the BLOCK
command to display the Block Definition dialog box (see Figure 1-1). When
you create a block, you need to know three things:
✦Name: The text string is used to identify the block and is used when
inserting the block into the drawing.
✦Base point: The base point of a block helps place it into the drawing
when you are inserting it. This point is usually established on an object
that’s selected when creating the block, but you don’t have to use the
same point to insert the block.
✦Selected objects: The objects used to define the way the block looks and
behaves when inserted into a drawing.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Playing with Blocks
Creating Blocks
419
AutoCAD provides other options beyond these three that can be specified in
the Block Definition dialog box, but the others alter the behavior of the block
when it’s placed into the drawing and aren’t required to create a block. I
explain the additional options available when creating a block in the
“Exploring some advanced options” section later in this chapter.
Accessing the Block Definition dialog box
To start the BLOCK command and display the Block Definition dialog box,
use one of the following methods:
✦On the ribbon, click Blocks & References tab➪Block panel➪Create.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Draw➪Block➪Make.
✦On the Draw toolbar, click the Make Block button.
✦At the command prompt, type BLOCK or B and press Enter.
Follow these steps to create a block:
1. Add the geometry to your drawing that you want to use to define a block.
If you want to control the visibility of the objects within the block later,
be sure to place the objects on specific layers so that they can be turned
on and off or frozen and thawed.
2. Use one of the methods just listed to initiate the BLOCK command.
The Block Definition dialog box appears (refer to Figure 1-1).
3. In the Name combo box, enter a meaningful name.
The name entered must be unique from other blocks that already exist
in the drawing, or you end up redefining the existing block with the new
Figure 1-1:
The Block
Definition
dialog box.

geometry, which might not be what you want to do. The name entered
must be less than 255 characters.
4. In the Base Point area, either click the Pick Point button and select a
point in the drawing or enter a coordinate value for the base point in
the X, Y, and Z text boxes.
The point that you specify will be used as the base point of the block or
its insertion point. Usually this point is on the geometry that’s being
selected to define the block.
If you clicked the Pick Point button in the Base Point area, you are
returned to the drawing window. Specify a point in the drawing to use as
the base point for the block. After you select the base point for the block
in the drawing window, you return to the Block Definition dialog box.
5. In the Objects area, click the Select Objects button.
You’re returned to the drawing window once again so you can select the
objects that you want to add to the block.
6. In the drawing window, select the objects you want to add to the
block. Press Enter to complete selecting objects and return to the
Block Definition dialog box.
The objects you select can be text, lines, circles, and even other blocks.
Any object you can select can be added to the block. You can use the
QuickSelect button to the right of the Select Objects button to filter
objects by specific property values.
7. In the Block Definition dialog box in the Objects area, click one of the
Select Objects modes.
The different object modes affect what happens to the selected objects
after the block is created:
• Retain: The selected objects remain in the drawing.
• Convert to block: The selected objects are removed from the drawing,
but the new block is inserted in the same location as the original
selected objects.
• Delete: The selected objects are removed from the drawing after the
block is created.
8. Deselect the Open in Block Editor option (at the bottom of the dialog box)
for now; I cover that option in a little bit.
AutoCAD 2006 introduced the Block Editor environment for editing blocks
and adding dynamic properties and actions. If the Open in Block Editor is
selected, the block is opened in the Block Editor when the Block Definition
dialog box is closed.
9. Click OK.
The Block Definition dialog box closes. Results vary based on the objects
selected, the selected objects mode, and the other settings chosen.

Creating geometry on Layer 0 (zero) is usually a “no-no” in AutoCAD, but when
geometry is added to a block that’s on Layer 0, it takes on the properties of
the layer that the block is inserted on. This is a great way to check and see
whether a block happens to be on the correct layer.
Exploring some advanced options
The preceding section covered the basic options in the Block Definition
dialog box that you need to create a block. In this section, I cover the other
options, because some of them can be used to enforce CAD standards. The
following list describes some of the more advanced options and fields in the
Block Definition dialog box:
✦Block unit: Specifies the units in which the block is being created. This
setting affects how the block is inserted into the drawing. If the block is
created in the units of Inches and inserted into a drawing that is speci-
fied as Millimeters, AutoCAD scales the block accordingly. If Block unit is
set to Unitless, the scaling of the block is controlled by the Insertion
Scale options in the Options dialog box under the User Preferences tab.
✦Annotative: When selected, the block is annotative and is scaled based on
the current annotative scale of model space or of a viewport object on a
layout tab. For more information on annotation scaling, see Chapter 4 of
Book III.
✦Match block orientation to layout: When selected, the orientation of the
block matches the layout’s orientation.
✦Scale uniformly: When selected, the block can only be scaled equally
along all axes. The option is available when the Annotative option is not
enabled.
✦Allow exploding: When selected, the block can be exploded by using
the EXPLODE command. For more information on the EXPLODE com-
mand, see Chapter 2 of Book II.
✦Description: The description is used in different interfaces in AutoCAD
that can display the block; some of these interfaces are DesignCenter
and the Tool Palettes window.
✦Hyperlink: Allows you to specify a hyperlink for the entire block. The
hyperlink can be used to link a view or layout in the drawing, an external
location such as a file, or a Web site via a URL to a block. You can access
the hyperlink by holding down the Ctrl key and clicking the block when
you see the icon of the globe and a chain link.
✦Open in block editor: When selected, the block is opened into the Block
Editor for further editing after the Block Definition dialog box is closed.

Inserting Blocks
422
Inserting Blocks
AutoCAD stores blocks in what is called the block definition table. The block
definition table is used to hold information and settings about the block. To
display the block in the drawing after you create it, you need to insert a ref-
erence of the block definition from the table. An inserted block in the draw-
ing is known as a block reference because it refers to its definition in the block
table. To insert a block into the current drawing file, you use the INSERT com-
mand, which opens the Insert dialog box (see Figure 1-2). The INSERT command
can insert a block from within the current drawing or an entire drawing file as
a block. It just depends on where the information you want to insert into the
drawing is located.
To start the INSERT command and display the Insert dialog box, use one of
the following methods:
✦On the ribbon, click Blocks & References tab➪Block panel➪Insert.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Insert menu➪Block.
✦On the Draw or Insert toolbars, click the Insert Block button.
✦At the command prompt, type INSERT or I and press Enter.
To insert a block into a drawing, follow these steps:
1. Start the INSERT command by using one of the previously listed methods.
The Insert dialog box appears (refer to Figure 1-2).
2. In the Insert dialog box, either click the down arrow on the Name
drop-down list and select the block that is defined in the drawing to
insert, or click the Browse button to insert a drawing as a block.
Figure 1-2:
The Insert
dialog box is
used to

423
The selected name is displayed in the text box of the Name drop-down
list. If you clicked the Browse button, the Select Drawing File dialog box
appears. If the block has a preview saved with it, the preview appears to
the right of the Browse button.
3. If you clicked the Browse button, in the Select Drawing File dialog
box, browse and select the drawing file that you want to insert as a
block. Click Open.
The name of the selected drawing file is displayed in the text box of the
Name drop-down list and the path to the drawing is displayed just below
the drop-down list.
4. In the Insert dialog box in the Insertion Point area, select or deselect
the Specify On-Screen option. If deselected, enter the coordinate
value for the insertion point of the block in the X, Y, and Z text boxes.
If Specify On-Screen is selected, you will be prompted for the insertion
point of the block during the block insertion process after the Insert
dialog box is closed.
5. In the Scale area, select or deselect the Specify On-Screen option. If
deselected, enter the scale for the x, y, and z axes in the text boxes. If
Uniform Scale is selected, you can enter a scale only in the X axis text
box and the value is automatically assigned to the two other axes.
If Specify On-Screen is selected, you will be prompted for the scale of the
block during the block insertion process. If the block was created with
the Scale Uniformly option selected, the Uniform Scale option is disabled
and selected (forcing you to use only uniform scale).
6. In the Rotation area, select or deselect the Specify On-Screen option.
If deselected, enter the rotation angle in the Angle text box.
If Specify On-Screen is selected, you are prompted for the rotation angle
of the block during the block insertion process.
7. In the Block Unit area, all you have to do is verify the current insertion
units and scale that you want applied to the block.
The Unit value is based on the current setting of the INSUNITS system
variable. This variable specifies the drawing’s current units for inserted
blocks. The Factor value is the result of the unit used when the block
was created and the current value of INSUNITS. To change the current
INSUNITS value, close the Insert dialog box and type INSUNITS at the
command prompt. Then enter the corresponding integer for the inser-
tion units you want. For more information, look up INSUNITS in
AutoCAD’s online Help.
8. At the bottom of the Insert dialog box, select or deselect if you want
the block to be exploded after it is inserted into the drawing.
If the Allow Exploding option was deselected in the Block Definition
dialog box when the block was created, the Explode option is disabled.

Managing Blocks
424
9. Click OK.
The Insert dialog box closes, and you are returned to the drawing
window. The INSERT command may still be running, based on whether
you selected any of the Specify On-Screen options for the insertion
point, scale, or rotation. Specify the prompts as required. Here are the
three possible prompts:
Specify insertion point or [Basepoint/Scale/Rotate]:
Specify scale factor <1>:
Specify rotation angle <0>:
You can create custom toolbars, menus, or ribbon panels to help insert
blocks. If you do create custom commands and place them on toolbars, menus,
or ribbon panels, you need to use the –INSERT command rather than the
INSERT command for the menu macro. The –INSERT command runs from the
command prompt instead of displaying a dialog box.
When inserting a block, you can specify its rotation and scale by using the
Properties palette if it’s displayed before you specify the insertion point of
the block. Using the Properties palette this way allows you to change the
dynamic properties of a block before it’s inserted. I cover dynamic proper-
ties of blocks in Chapter 2 of this minibook.
Managing Blocks
Blocks are a powerful feature of AutoCAD and no doubt you will be using them
as often as you can. AutoCAD offers several tools and commands for managing
blocks. Some of the ways to manage blocks in a drawing are as follows:
✦Rename a block definition
✦Redefine a block definition
✦Purge a block definition
✦Export a block definition to a drawing file
Renaming a block definition
You can rename blocks by using the RENAME command. Follow these steps
to rename a block:
1. At the command prompt, type RENAME and press Enter. Or on the
ribbon, click Tools tab➪Drawing Utilities panel➪Rename.
The renamed dialog box appears.
2. In the Named Objects list, select Blocks.
3. In the Items list, select the block that you want to rename.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Playing with Blocks
Managing Blocks
425
The name of the selected block in the Items list is displayed in the Old
Name text box.
4. In the text box directly below the Old Name text box, type the new
name and click Rename To.
5. Rename additional blocks if necessary, and then click OK to exit the
Rename dialog box.
Redefining a block definition
You can redefine (or edit) a block definition. In releases before AutoCAD
2006 and AutoCAD LT 2007, you insert a block and then explode it. After
exploding it, you make the necessary changes to the geometry and then
reblock it by using the BLOCK command again. Or you might use the
REFEDIT command, which allows you to open a block or an xref so the geom-
etry can be modified. Some issues with using the REFEDIT command can be
overcome with the BEDIT command. I cover the REFEDIT command in
Chapter 3 of this minibook.
AutoCAD LT does not support the REFEDIT command.
Redefining a block in AutoCAD 2006 and AutoCAD LT 2007 became so much
simpler with the introduction of the Block Editor. The Block Editor allows
you to edit a block in its own drawing window. You use the BEDIT command
to start the Block Editor. Follow these steps to edit a block definition with
the Block Editor:
1. In the drawing window, select the block that you want to redefine.
2. Right-click and select Block Editor from the shortcut menu.
The block definition is opened in the Block Editor.
3. In the Block Editor, make your changes to the existing geometry or
add geometry as you normally do when working in the drawing
window.
4. On the ribbon, click Close Block Editor to exit the Block Editor.
5. When prompted to save the changes, click Yes.
You’re returned to the drawing window, and the references to the edited
block are updated.
Purging a block definition
You can completely remove blocks that are not being used and will never be
used by using the PURGE command and Purge dialog box. Follow these steps
to purge a block definition from a drawing:

Managing Blocks
426
1. Before you can purge a block, you must remove all inserted refer-
ences of the block.
2. At the command prompt, type PURGE and press Enter. Or on the
ribbon, click Tools tab➪Drawing Utilities panel➪Purge.
3. In the Purge dialog box, double-click the All Items node if it is not
already expanded, and then expand the Blocks node.
The block definitions that can be purged appear.
4. Select the block and click Purge.
The Confirm Purge dialog box is displayed.
5. In the Confirm Purge dialog box, click Yes.
The block definition is removed from below the Blocks node and from
the drawing. The Confirm Purge dialog box is displayed if you selected the
Confirm Each Item to Be Purged option (near the bottom of the Purge
dialog box).
6. Click Close to exit the Purge dialog box.
To quickly purge all unused named objects from a drawing, select the Purge
Nested Items option and deselect the Confirm Each Item to Be Purged option
in the Purge dialog box. Then click Purge All. This purges all nested named
objects out of a drawing, without stopping to prompt and ask whether you
really want to remove the item.
Exporting a block definition
Blocks created by using the BLOCK or BEDIT commands are defined only in
the current drawing, but many times you will want to be able to access the
block from other drawings. The Write Block dialog box, shown in Figure 1-3,
is used to export a block from the current drawing and make a new drawing
file based on a selected block. The Write Block dialog box is displayed with
the WBLOCK command. You can also use DesignCenter to insert blocks
stored in a drawing; I cover DesignCenter in Chapter 4 of this minibook.
Follow these steps to export a block definition to a new drawing file:
1. At the command prompt, type WBLOCK and press Enter.
2. Under the Source area of the Write Block dialog box, select Block.
All the controls under the Source area except for the drop-down list
become disabled.
3. From the drop-down list, select the block you want to export.

Enhancing Blocks with Attributes
427
4. Specify a file name and path in the File name and path text box under
the Destination area or click the Ellipsis button to specify a path and
name by using a dialog box.
If the Ellipsis button is clicked, the Browse for Drawing File dialog box
appears. Browse to the location where you want to create the new draw-
ing file and enter a name. Click Save after you have specified the new
folder location and file name, and return to the Write Block dialog box.
5. In the Write Block dialog box, specify the insertion units for the new
drawing by selecting one of the options from the Insert units drop-
down list.
AutoCAD applies the insertion units to the drawing and uses them when
the drawing is inserted into another drawing.
6. Click OK to export the block as a new drawing and to close the Write
Block dialog box.
You can create a new drawing instead of using the WBLOCK command. To
define the insertion point that should be used when inserting a drawing into
another drawing, use the BASE command or the INSBASE system variable.
Either the BASE command or INSBASE system variable allows you to re-
define the insertion point that is used for inserting a drawing as a block.
Enhancing Blocks with Attributes
Blocks can store custom information, and that information can later be
extracted to an external file or a table object (AutoCAD only). To store
custom information with a block, you use an attribute. You use attributes to
Figure 1-3:
The Write
Block dialog
box is used
to export a

definition.

Enhancing Blocks with Attributes
428
hold information in a block such as a part number, a description or even
project-related information. You will often find that title blocks contain
attributes, which allows the user to edit all the attributes at one time instead
of individually as you have to do with text or multiline text. Attributes may
appear like standard text objects, but they’re much more than that. You can
change the text value of attributes when they’re part of a block.
Adding an attribute to a block definition
Attributes are added to a block in the same way you add other types of
geometry, such as lines or arcs. First you add an attribute to the drawing and
then you add the attribute to the block. When an attribute is added to a
drawing, it is known as an attribute definition. The attribute definition is
stored in the block definition and is used to describe what the actual attrib-
ute of the block reference should be like. When a block is inserted into the
drawing, attributes are added to each block reference that contains attribute
definitions. To create an attribute definition, you use the ATTDEF command
to display the Attribute Definition dialog box (see Figure 1-4).
To start the ATTDEF command and display the Attribute Definition dialog
box, follow one of the following methods:

The following steps explain how to create an attribute definition and then
add it to a block:
1. Add the geometry to your drawing that you want to use to define a block.
2. Start the ATTDEF command by using one of the methods previously
listed.
The Attribute Definition dialog box appears (refer to Figure 1-4).
3. In the Mode area, select the options that you want to use for the attrib-
ute definition.
Attributes can have six modes:
• Invisible: When selected, the attribute is invisible. By default, the
attribute is visible. If an attribute is invisible, you can set the
ATTMODE system variable to a value of 2 to display all invisible
attributes in a drawing.
• Constant: When selected, the attribute has a fixed value which is
assigned to all blocks and can’t be changed unless you use a com-
mand such as BEDIT or BATTMAN.
• Verify: When selected, you’re prompted to verify that the value
entered is correct for the block being inserted into a drawing.
• Preset: When selected, the default value is automatically assigned to
the block when it’s inserted into a drawing.
• Lock position: When selected, the attribute can’t be moved by using
grips. You use this mode also when you want to control the place-
ment of the attribute with dynamic properties. I cover working with
dynamic properties in Chapter 2 of this minibook.
• Multiple lines. When selected, the attribute supports multiple lines
of text instead of a single line of text.
4. In the Attribute area, specify the attribute’s tag, prompt, and default
value.
The tag is the value you see on-screen before the attribute is added to a
block. The prompt is what the user sees at the command prompt, in the
Edit Attributes or the Enhanced Attribute Editor (AutoCAD only), when
inserting or editing the attribute values of a block. The default value
defines the value that the attribute has when it’s inserted in a drawing.
The default value can be a plain text string that contains field values or
can be defined with special multiline formatting.
5. In the Insertion Point area, select or deselect the Specify On-Screen
option. If it’s deselected, enter the coordinate value for the insertion
point of the block in the X, Y, and Z text boxes.

Enhancing Blocks with Attributes
430
If Specify On-Screen is selected, you will be prompted for the insertion
point of the attribute after you click OK to close the Attribute Definition
dialog box.
6. In the Text Settings area, specify the attribute’s justification, text style,
height, rotation, and boundary width (if Multiple lines in Mode area is
selected).
Justification of the attribute controls how the value of the attribute
appears at its insertion point. The text style controls the font and other
text characteristics used for the tag and value of the attribute. Height
specifies the height of the text, and rotation controls the rotation angle
after the attribute is created. Both the height and rotation properties
have buttons that can be used to specify a distance or angle by using
points in the drawing. Boundary width defines the width of the bounding
box for the attribute text when the attribute is set to Multiple lines; you
can enter a number or click Boundary width to pick a distance in the
drawing. The Annotative check box controls whether the attribute
scales based on the current annotation scale or matches the orientation
of the block.
7. Initially, the Align below Previous Attribute Definition check box is de-
selected. Select the option if you have inserted an attribute in your draw-
ing and want the next one placed below the one previously created.
When selected, the attribute is positioned below the previously created
attribute.
8. Click OK.
The Attribute Definition dialog box closes, and you’re returned to the
drawing window. The ATTDEF command might still be running, depend-
ing on whether you selected the Specify On-Screen options for the inser-
tion point. If you need to specify an insertion point for the attribute
definition, the following prompt is displayed:
Specify start point:
9. Start the BLOCK command and create the block as you normally do —
just don’t forget to add the attribute.
When you insert a block with attributes or edit the attribute values, you’re
prompted to edit the attribute values in a specific order. The order of the
attributes is determined by the order they’re selected when the block is cre-
ated. Select each attribute in the order you want them to be displayed when
the block is inserted or edited.
Inserting a block with attributes
You insert a block with attributes the same way you insert a block without
attributes, except after the block has been inserted into the drawing, you’re

Book VI
Chapter 1
Playing with Blocks
Enhancing Blocks with Attributes
431
prompted to change the values for the attributes contained in the block with
the Edit Attributes dialog box (see Figure 1-5) or at the command line. You’re
not prompted for attributes that are flagged as constant or preset.
The ATTDIA and ATTREQ system variables affect how a block with attributes
is inserted. ATTDIA controls the display of the Edit Attributes dialog box or
the command prompt for entering values for attributes when a block with
attributes is inserted. ATTREQ enables or suppresses the prompts for enter-
ing values for attributes when a block with attributes is inserted.
Editing an attribute’s value in a block
You can edit an attribute’s value for a block by using the Properties palette,
the Edit Attributes dialog box (ATTDEF), or the Enhanced Attribute Editor
(EATTEDIT) — this works with AutoCAD only. The easiest way to edit an
attribute value is to double-click the attribute you want to edit or a block that
contains attributes. Doing so launches the default Attribute Editor. Make the
changes to the values of the attributes in the dialog box that is displayed.
Managing attributes in blocks
When you redefine blocks with attributes, you need to be aware of some-
thing. When you use the BMAKE or BEDIT command to update a block with
attributes, only the changes to the objects in the block are reflected in the
drawing unless the block contains attributes that are defined as constant.
Any redefined block containing nonconstant attributes will take some extra
effort to get them to update correctly in the drawing. If you redefine a block
and add or change the properties of the attributes for a block, you must do
one of the following:
✦Delete and reinsert the block so all the attributes and property changes
are used as part of the block reference.
Figure 1-5:
Editing
attribute
values after
a block is
inserted.

Enhancing Blocks with Attributes
432
✦Use the ATTSYNC (Attribute Synchronize) command. Using this com-
mand ensures that all the existing blocks in the drawing are updated.
(This command is available only in AutoCAD.)
✦The BATTMAN (Block Attribute Manager) command allows you to
modify the properties of attributes in a block. You can use this com-
mand to change the order in which the attributes appear when edited
along with other properties such as color, layer, and even text style.
(This command is available only in AutoCAD.)
Extracting attribute data from blocks
You can extract attributes from a drawing by using the Attribute Extraction
dialog box (ATTEXT), which you can find in both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, or
the Data Extraction Wizard (EATTEXT), which is available only in AutoCAD.
Attributes can be extracted to external data files and brought into your favorite
spreadsheet or database program, or in AutoCAD you can extract attribute
values and create a table object that summarizes all like values. For information
on extracting attributes out of your drawing, see the online Help topics Extract
Data from Block Attributes or Extract Block Attribute Data (Advanced), which
you can access from the Contents tab of the online Help system. Choose User’s
Guide➪Create and Modify Objects➪Create Use Blocks (Symbols)➪Attach Data

I
n Chapter 1 of this minibook, I discuss how to create and manage blocks
with and without attributes. The types of blocks that you create by using
the BLOCK command and any blocks that were created prior to AutoCAD
2006 or AutoCAD LT 2007 are known as a static blocks or legacy blocks (Blocks
version 1.0). AutoCAD 2006 and AutoCAD LT 2007 introduced a new type of
block called a dynamic block (Blocks version 2.0). Static blocks are altered pri-
marily through placement, rotation, overall scaling, and the editing of attribute
values. Dynamic blocks enhance static blocks by adding a new level of editing.
Dynamic blocks allow you to stretch the geometry of a block in one direction
and confine the distance that the block can be stretched by a set of incremen-
tal values. This chapter focuses on how to add dynamic behavior to a block.
What Makes a Block Dynamic?
Dynamic blocks are static blocks with some new tricks — you might not be
able to teach your old dog new tricks, but blocks are eager to learn. Dynamic
blocks are created in the Block Editor, which is displayed with the BEDIT com-
mand. Dynamic blocks can contain custom properties that are defined by
adding parameters and actions to the block. Parameters and actions bring
blocks to life by allowing you to rotate, move, or modify objects within each
instance of a block. If you want to move objects within a static block, you
have to explode the block and then reblock it with a different name or use in-
place reference editing (REFEDIT command); otherwise, reblocking the block
with the same name changes all the instances of that block in the drawing.
Dynamic blocks allow you to assign the following actions to objects within a
block:
✦Move
✦Scale
✦Stretch

Block Editor Environment
434
✦Polar Stretch
✦Rotate
✦Flip (or Mirror)
✦Array
✦Lookups
After parameters and actions have been assigned to a block, the block doesn’t
look any different until you select it when no command is running. Based on
the type of parameters added to the block, you see different types of grips
appear. Some of these grips appear in the form of circles, arrows, and triangles
(see Figure 2-1).
Block Editor Environment
The Block Editor, shown in Figure 2-2, was mentioned briefly in Chapter 1 of
this minibook because it can be opened when creating a block with the Block
Definition dialog box. The Block Editor is a special instance of the drawing
window that allows you to work with a block definition in the same way that
you work with a drawing file. The Block Editor also allows you to add parame-
ters and actions to a block definition to change the way it behaves after an
instance of the block is inserted into the drawing. Unlike the main window, the
Block Editor doesn’t allow you to use some commands, such as BLOCK,
REFEDIT (AutoCAD only), and PLOT, and it doesn’t contain layout tabs or but-
tons because blocks don’t contain layouts.
Figure 2-1:
Dynamic
blocks can

Book VI
Chapter 2
Dynamic Blocks
Block Editor Environment
435
After you open the block definition, you can add or remove geometry, add or
remove parameters and actions, and work with attributes. You can also capture
block and custom properties by using fields with attribute definitions in the block.
Components of the Block Editor
Even though the Block Editor is similar to a standard drawing window, it still
uses some specialized interfaces. When the Block Editor is active, three
additional panels are added to the ribbon and organized on the Block Editor
tab (see Figure 2-3). The Block Editor ribbon tab is displayed only when the
Block Editor is active. These ribbon panels contain tools that you use to
enhance a legacy block or modify a dynamic block.
Here is a list of what you can accomplish from the Block Editor tab:
✦Save: Saves the changes made to the block definition.
✦Save As: Displays the Save Block As dialog box and allows you to save
the block definition as a new block.
✦Block Editor: Displays the Edit Block Definition dialog box and allows
you to open a different block definition from inside the Block Editor.
✦Block Definition Name: Displays the name of the open block definition.
✦Parameter: Starts the BPARAMTER command and allows you to add a
parameter without using the Block Authoring palettes.

✦Action: Starts the BACTION command and allows you to add an action
without using the Block Authoring palettes.
✦Define Attribute: Starts the ATTDEF command and displays the
Attribute Definition dialog box, allowing you to add an attribute defini-
tion to the block definition.
✦Update: Starts the REGEN command to update the display of text, arrow-
heads, grips, and a few other display elements in the Block Editor.
(These elements are based on the current zoom factor of the block in
the drawing window.)
✦Block Authoring Palettes: Displays or hides the Block Authoring
Palettes window.
✦Learn: Starts the New Features Workshop.
✦Visibility States: Displays the Visibility States dialog box so you can
create, edit, or delete visibility states from the block.
✦Visibility Mode: Controls the current visibility of objects in the Block
Editor that have been assigned to a Visibility State.
✦Make Visible: Starts the BVHIDE command and allows you to display
objects that are currently invisible in the current visibility state.
✦Make Invisible: Starts the BVHIDE command and allows you to hide
objects from the current visibility state.
✦Block Visibility State List: Specifies which visibility state is current.
✦Close Block Editor: Closes the Block Editor and prompts you to save
any changes made.

You use the Block Authoring Palettes window (see Figure 2-4) to add parame-
ters and actions to a block. By using the parameters, you define custom proper-
ties for the open block definition. After a parameter is added to a block, in most
cases you must associate an action with the parameter for it to be usable.
Actions define which geometry is associated with a parameter and what hap-
pens when the parameter is used with grip editing. The Block Authoring
Palettes window has three tabs. One contains the available parameters and
another contains the available actions. The final tab contains both parameters
and actions in what are called parameter sets. If you’re new to creating dynamic
blocks, the parameter sets can help you work more quickly by combining many
of the common parameter and action combinations into easy-to-use tools.
Editing a block definition
To start the Block Editor, you use the BEDIT command. The BEDIT command
displays the Edit Block Definition dialog box (see Figure 2-5). From the Edit
Block Definition dialog box, you select a block from the list to edit or enter a
name in the text box to create a new block. The Edit Block Definition dialog
box displays a preview of the block that is selected from the list and its asso-
ciated description. If the preview displays a small lightning bolt in the lower-
right corner, the selected block is a dynamic block. This indicator is displayed
in many of the different interfaces and dialog boxes where block previews are
displayed.
When set to 0, the BLOCKEDITLOCK system variable allows you to edit blocks
by using the BEDIT command. When set to a value of 1, it doesn’t allow the
BEDIT command to be started and, in turn, restricts the modifying of a block’s
dynamic properties.

To start the BEDIT command and display the Edit Block Definition dialog
box, use one of the following methods:
✦On the ribbon, click Blocks & References tab➪Block panel➪Block Editor.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Tools menu➪Block Editor.
✦On the Standard or Standard Annotation toolbar, click the Block Editor
button.
✦At the command prompt, type BEDIT or BE and press Enter.
✦Select a block and right-click. From the shortcut menu, select Block
Editor. This option automatically opens the selected block’s definition in
the Block Editor.
The following steps explain how to modify a block with the Block Editor:
1. Start the BEDIT command by using one of the methods described in
the preceding list.
The Edit Block Definition dialog box appears.
2. Select a block from the list and click OK.
The selected block is opened in the Block Editor.
3. Make the necessary changes to the block.
4. On the Block Editor ribbon tab, click Close panel➪Close Block Editor.
A message box asks you to save your changes.
5. Click Yes to save the changes.
Clicking Yes closes the Block Editor and saves the changes made to the
block definition. If you click No, the Block Editor closes and the changes
are discarded, and if you click Cancel, you remain in the Block Editor.

If you add or remove attributes from the block definition, the changes are
not reflected in the block references that currently exist in the drawing until
you erase and reinsert the blocks. If you’re using AutoCAD and not AutoCAD
LT, you can use the ATTSYNC command to update the attributes of the block
references in the drawing.
Going Dynamic
When you have a block open in the Block Editor, you can add parameters
and actions to your block. Most parameters require an action for them to be
used. AutoCAD offers ten parameters for you to place in the drawing; three
do not require an associated actions.
Table 2-1 lists the available parameters and the actions that can be associ-
ated with them.

3. In the Block Authoring Palettes window, click the Parameters tab and
then click the Point Parameter tool.
The Parameters tab is displayed and the BPARAMETER command starts
with the Point option.
4. At the Specify parameter location prompt, specify a point in the draw-
ing window for the parameter to reference, or choose one of the avail-
able options by right-clicking and selecting the option from the
shortcut menu.
The command line displays the prompt
Command: _BParameter Point
Specify parameter location or
[Name/Label/Chain/Description/Palette]:
5. At the Specify label location prompt, specify the location in the draw-
ing where you want to place the label for the parameter.
The command line displays the prompt
Specify label location:
The label is a visual reference to the parameter. The label is used in the
Block Editor, the Properties palette, and to reference the property in a
field. The parameter will be displayed with a yellow box that contains an
exclamation point in it; this is because no action has been associated
with the parameter yet.
6. In the drawing window, select the parameter that was just placed and
right-click. From the shortcut menu, choose Properties.
The Properties palette appears with the parameter’s properties.
7. In the Properties palette, change the properties in the Property
Labels, Geometry, and Misc areas to change the behavior of the
parameter.
The Properties palette allows you to control the different properties
associated with each parameter type. The properties vary based on
each parameter. To find out about each property, see the online Help
topic Add Dynamic Behavior to Blocks, which you can access from the
Contents tab of the online Help system. Choose User’s Guide➪Create

Adding actions
You add actions to a block by using the Block Authoring Palettes or the BAC-
TIONTOOL command. To add a move action to a point parameter, follow
these steps:
1. Open an existing block with the Edit Block Definition dialog box, or
create a new block with the Block Definition dialog box and make
sure that the Open Block in Editor option is selected. If you create a
new block, you need to first add a parameter to the block before you
can add an action (see the preceding section for information on
adding a parameter).
For information on the Edit Block Definition dialog box, see the “Editing
a block definition” section earlier in this chapter. For information on the
Block Definition dialog box, see Chapter 1 in this minibook.
2. In the Block Editor, if the Block Authoring Palettes interface is not dis-
played, on the ribbon click Block Editor tab➪Tools panel➪Block
Authoring Palettes.
The Block Authoring Palettes window appears.
3. Click the Actions tab and then click the Move Action tool.
The Parameters tab is displayed and the BACTIONTOOL command
starts with the Point option.
The command line displays the prompt
Command: _BActionTool Move
Select parameter:
4. At the Select parameter prompt, select the parameter that you want to
associate with the action.
After the parameter is selected, this prompt is displayed at the com-
mand line:
Specify selection set for action
Select objects:
5. In the Block Editor, select the objects that you want to associate with
the action, and press Enter when you have finished selecting objects.
The following prompt appears at the command line:
Specify action location or [Multiplier/Offset]:

6. Specify a point in the Block Editor for the action, or choose one of the
available options by right-clicking and choosing the option from the
shortcut menu.
The point that you specify should be near the parameter so that you
know which actions are associated with each parameter. The actual
placement has no bearing on how the action works. After you create the
action, the yellow box with an exclamation point in it near the parameter
disappears. This indicates that the parameter is now associated with an
action.
7. Select the action that was just placed and right-click. From the short-
cut menu, select Properties.
The Properties palette appears, showing the action’s properties.
8. In the Properties palette, change the properties in the Geometry,
Overrides, and Misc areas to change the behavior of the parameter.
The Properties palette allows you to control the behavior of an action.
The properties vary based on the selected action.
9. On the ribbon, click Block Editor tab➪Manage panel➪Save.
You remain in the Block Editor so you can continue adding parameters
or actions as needed.
8. On the ribbon, click Block Editor tab➪Close panel➪Close Block Editor
to exit the Block Editor.
Using parameter sets
Parameter sets simplify the process of adding parameters and actions indi-
vidually by combining the two into a streamlined process. To use a parameter
set, display the Block Authoring Palettes window while in the Block Editor and
click the Parameter Sets tab. When the Parameter Sets tab is active, click the
parameter set you want to use and follow the prompts that are displayed.
Visibility states
You use visibility states to control the display of geometry within a block.
This can be a great advantage when you’re doing drawings and need to change
out a block from one to another. For example, you may have a plumbing draw-
ing that uses several types of valves. You can use one block to represent six
types of valves. In releases prior to AutoCAD 2006 or AutoCAD LT 2007, you
had to erase the block from the drawing and then find the other block to
insert, which takes time. You can accomplish this task much more quickly by
using dynamic blocks and visibility states. The Visibility States dialog box,
shown in Figure 2-6, allows you to create, rename, delete, set current, or
change the order of a visibility state for a block.

Going Dynamic
444
Follow these steps to add a visibility parameter in a block:
1. Open an existing block with the Edit Block Definition dialog box, or
create a new block with the Block Definition dialog box and make
sure the Open Block in Editor option is checked.
For information on the Edit Block Definition dialog box, see the section
“Editing a block definition” earlier in this chapter. For information on the

Using Dynamic Blocks
You use and modify dynamic blocks similar to how you use a static (or
legacy) block, including the methods for inserting blocks, editing attributes,
and manipulating properties through the Properties palette. In this section, I
describe the differences between the two.
Inserting a dynamic block
Dynamic blocks are inserted into the drawing just like you insert a static (or
legacy) block. You can use the Insert dialog box by starting the INSERT com-
mand and dragging and dropping blocks from the DesignCenter or the Tool
Palettes window. Chapter 4 of this minibook discusses the DesignCenter and the
Tool Palettes window. If you use the Tool Palettes window to insert a dynamic
block, you can specify the value for each of its custom properties before the
block is inserted into the drawing. You can also use the Properties palette to
specify the values for dynamic properties as you drag a block on-screen.
While the block is being dragged on-screen, you can toggle through the
points at which parameters are referencing in the dynamic block. These
points are called the insertion cycling order. You can specify the insertion
cycling order while you are in the Block Editor by using the Insertion Cycling
Order dialog box (see Figure 2-8), which is displayed with the BCYCLEORDER
command. Pressing the Ctrl key while dragging a block on-screen toggles
through the various insertion cycling points in the block.

Modifying a dynamic block
The key benefit of a dynamic block is that after you finish adding the param-
eters to a block and associating actions to each parameter that needs one,
you can modify the block without exploding it after it is inserted into the
drawing. This allows you to take advantage of attributes in your drawing,
which would not be possible if you exploded the block.
Using a dynamic block’s custom grips
To modify a dynamic block, you select the block to enable its grips and
manipulate the geometry assigned to the parameter and action. You can also
use the Properties palette to manipulate custom properties of a dynamic
block in the Custom area. Select the custom property in the Properties
palette and change its value. Some custom properties can be reference
points, rotation angles, or a list of values.
Resetting a dynamic block
You might want to reset a dynamic block to its initial state; you could rein-
sert the block which requires unnecessary work. AutoCAD allows you to
reset a dynamic block to its initial state by using the Reset Block option from
the shortcut menu that appears when you select a block and right-click.
Doing so resets only the custom properties of the block and none of the
attribute values.
The RESETBLOCK command allows you to reset multiple block references at
a single time.

Dynamic Blocks in Older Release

Dynamic Blocks in Older Releases
When a DWG file is saved to an older release (with the exception of AutoCAD
2006 and later), dynamic blocks appear as if they are static blocks. A
dynamic block when listed in a release prior to AutoCAD 2006 shows as an
anonymous block, which is a name that is assigned by AutoCAD and not the
same name that the block is given when it is created. The custom properties
don’t work in an older release because the release doesn’t understand the
information. If the block is left unaltered in an older release after it is saved
to a previous version of the DWG file format, the dynamic properties of the
block will work again when the drawing is reopened in AutoCAD 2006 or
later. If the dynamic block contains fields in its attributes, AutoCAD displays
the field values with their last updated value.
Because dynamic blocks are relatively new, older applications that are used
to extend AutoCAD and work with blocks may not work correctly with
dynamic blocks. You should test each application that manipulates blocks
with dynamic blocks. If the application doesn’t work correctly, contact the
vendor of the application to see if an updated version is available.

T
he first two chapters of this minibook explain how to create and work
with blocks. Blocks form the cornerstone of reusable content in draw-
ings. In this chapter, you read about external references and how you can
use them to improve communication and keep file size down. External refer-
ences are used to link DWG, DWF, DWFx, DGN, and raster image files into a
drawing. By linking these files into the drawing, you have the most up-to-
date geometry or image displayed. Some types of external references allow
you to snap directly to the geometry that they reference.
AutoCAD LT 2009 now allows you to not only view raster images that are
attached to a drawing file but also to attach raster images to a drawing file.
Blocks versus External References
Blocks are groups of objects that are assigned a user-defined name. The defi-
nition of a block is stored in a drawing file, and when a change is required,
the block needs to be redefined. This can be a problem if the block is con-
tained in a number of different drawings. External references maintain a link
to a file outside a drawing that contains drawing objects or a raster image;
the contents of the file are not actually part of the drawing file that they are
being referenced into.
An external reference in a drawing file contains the location of the external file
on disk, the file name of the referenced file, and its insertion point, scale, and

angle of rotation. When you open a drawing that contains references to exter-
nal files, the external files are reloaded as long as AutoCAD can locate them.
This makes external references ideal for creating plans of a building that spans
multiple drawings or drawings that can benefit from the use of geometry
stored in other drawings. A floor plan for a building is an ideal example of how
external references might be used because it is not uncommon for a floor plan
to be the base drawing for other drawings that might be used for a reflected
ceiling grid or for building systems such as HVAC or sprinklers.
Working with External References
You work with external references through a single interface called the External
References palette (see Figure 3-1). This palette allows you to attach, detach,
reload, unload, and access the details of the various types of supported exter-
nal references. You use the EXTERNALREFERENCES command to display the
External References palette.
The controls along the top of the palette allow you to attach an external refer-
ence, reload external references that are currently attached, or launch Help.
The File References area is the main portion of the palette and displays which
files are referenced into the current drawing. This area allows you to control
how you view the referenced files in the palette, either in the default list view,
which just shows which files are referenced, or the tree view, which displays
the relationship between the parent (or host) drawing and all the files that are
currently being referenced. The lower portion of the palette displays details or
a preview about the selected reference in the File References area.

To start the EXTERNALREFERENCES command and display the External
References palette, do one of the following:
✦On the ribbon, click View tab➪Palettes panel➪External References.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Tools menu➪Palettes➪External
References or Insert menu➪External References.
✦On the Reference toolbar, click the External References button.
✦At the command prompt, type EXTERNALREFERENCES or ER and 
press Enter.
Path to success with xrefs
AutoCAD allows you to reference a drawing file into another drawing. The
drawing that is being referenced is referred to as an xref, which is short for
external reference. When a drawing is referenced into another drawing, all the
styles contained in the referenced file are maintained, so the drawing looks
just like it would if you opened the file. Attaching an xref is similar to insert-
ing a block, except you need to specify an attachment and a path type. There
are two different attachment types for xrefs: attachment and overlay. The fol-
lowing list explains the two attachment types:
✦Attachment: Attachment type xrefs are displayed if the host drawing file
in which they are contained is referenced into another drawing file.
✦Overlay: Overlay type xrefs are not displayed if the host drawing file in
which they are contained is referenced into another drawing file.
When an xref is attached to a drawing, you can control how AutoCAD stores
the path information to the source file associated with the xref. There are
three different path types for xrefs:
✦Full path: Maintains an absolute path to the file, which includes the
drive letter and all folders. This option is the least flexible because it
requires the drawings to be placed in specific locations in order for
AutoCAD to find them.
✦Relative path: Only the path relative to the parent (or host) drawing is
maintained with the xref. This option is more flexible than Full path if
your xrefs are stored in subfolders above or below the parent drawing.
✦No path: No path information is maintained with the xref. AutoCAD
looks in the parent (or host) drawings folder for the xrefs. This option is
the easiest to maintain because it looks for the xrefs in the same folder
as the parent drawing. Even though it is the easiest to use, it doesn’t
allow for much in the form of organization as the other two options do.

Working with External References
452
When AutoCAD loads an xref, it first looks in the folder that the external file
was in when it was attached, based on the specified path type. From there, it
looks in the following locations in the order listed:
✦The current folder of the parent (or host) drawing
✦The project search paths specified under the Project Files Search Path
node on the Files tab of the Options dialog box, or the PROJECTNAME
system variable (AutoCAD only)
✦The support search paths specified under the Support File Search Path
node on the Files tab of the Options dialog box
✦The path specified in the Start-in property of the shortcut used to start
AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT
Attaching an xref
Xrefs are attached to a drawing through the External References palette or
the XATTACH command. During the attachment process, you need to deter-
mine the type of attachment that should be used, where in the drawing the
xref should be placed, its scale and rotation, and the path type that should
be used. When the xref is attached, all its named objects are suffixed with
|filename
For example, if a drawing file named 1234 - Floor Plan contained a layer
called TitleBlock, and the file was referenced into another drawing, the layer
would be named TitleBlock|1234 — Floor Plan.
To start the XATTACH command and display the External Reference dialog
box, do one of the following:
✦On the ribbon, click Blocks & Reference tab ➪Reference panel➪DWG.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Insert menu➪DWG Reference.
✦On the Reference or Insert toolbar, click the Attach Xref button.
✦At the command prompt, type XATTACH or XA and press Enter.
✦On the External References palette, right-click the File References area
and choose Attach DWG from the shortcut menu.
To attach a DWG reference to a drawing file, follow these steps:
1. Start the XATTACH command by using one of the methods in the pre-
ceding list.
The Select Reference File dialog box is displayed.

Book VI
Chapter 3
External References
Working with External References
453
2. Browse to and select the drawing file that you want to attach. Click
Open.
The Select Reference File dialog box closes, and the External Reference
dialog box appears (see Figure 3-2). The path to and the name of the file you
selected appear in the Found In and Saved Path fields, respectively. The
Name drop-down list allows you to select a previously attached drawing file,
and Browse allows you to specify a different drawing file to reference.
3. In the Reference Type area, specify the type of attachment for the xref.
You can select either Attachment or Overlay.
4. In the Path Type area, specify the path format that should be main-
tained when attaching the xref.
You can select Full Path, Relative Path, or No Path. If you want to use the
Relative Path option, the drawing that the xref is being attached to must
be saved first. For more information on the available path options, see
“Path to success with xrefs” earlier in this chapter.
5. In the Insertion Point area, select or deselect the Specify On-Screen
option. If it’s deselected, enter the coordinate value for the insertion
point of the block in the X, Y, and Z text boxes.
If Specify On-Screen is selected, you’re prompted for the insertion point
of the xref after you click OK to close the External Reference dialog box.
6. In the Scale area, select or deselect the Specify On-Screen option. If
it’s deselected, enter the scale for the X, Y, and Z axes in the text
boxes, but if Uniform Scale is selected, you can enter a scale only in
the X axis text box.
Figure 3-2:

If Specify On-Screen is selected, AutoCAD prompts you for the scale of
the xref after you click OK to close the External Reference dialog box.
7. In the Rotation area, either select or deselect the Specify On-Screen
option. If it’s deselected, enter the rotation angle in the Rotation text
box.
If Specify On-Screen is selected, you’re prompted for the rotation angle
of the xref after you click OK to close the External Reference dialog box.
8. In the Block Unit area, verify the current insertion units and scale that
will be applied to the block.
The Unit value is based on the current setting of the INSUNITS system
variable, which specifies the drawing’s current units for inserted blocks.
The Factor value is the result of the unit used when the xref was created
and the current value of INSUNITS.
To change the current value of INSUNITS, close the External Reference
dialog box and use the UNITS command to display the Units dialog box.
In the Units dialog box, select the desired insertion unit from the drop-
down list in the Insertion Units area and then click OK.
9. Click OK.
The External Reference dialog box closes, and AutoCAD returns to the
drawing window. The XATTACH command may still be running depend-
ing on whether you selected any of the Specify On-Screen options for 
the insertion point, scale, or rotation. The following prompts might be
displayed:
Specify insertion point or
[Scale/X/Y/Z/Rotate/PScale/PX/PY/PZ/PRotate]:
Enter X scale factor, specify opposite corner, or
[Corner/XYZ] <1>:
Enter Y scale factor <use X scale factor>:
Specify rotation angle <0>:
External reference notification
AutoCAD offers a notification system for various features. External references
are part of this notification system. You can see when a drawing has an xref
attached to it by the appearance of the Manage Xrefs icon in the status bar tray.
When a change occurs to one of the attached external references, the icon
changes and a notification balloon is displayed (see Figure 3-3). Click the link in
the notification balloon to reload the external references that have changed.

Book VI
Chapter 3
External References
Working with External References
455
The External Reference notification can be turned on and off with the
XREFNOTIFY system variable (AutoCAD only). The default value is 2, which
displays the balloon and changes the icon to reflect a change to one of the
xrefs. Instead of completely disabling the notification, you may want to 
use the TRAYSETTINGS command to control how long the notification is 
displayed.
Editing an xref
Xrefs can be edited by using many of the common modify commands, but
there are also some unique commands that are available for modifying xrefs.
There will be times when you’ll want to make changes directly to the draw-
ing file that’s being referenced; in these cases, AutoCAD allows you to edit
the xrefs in-place or open them in a drawing window. The commands that
allow you to perform these editing operations are REFEDIT and XOPEN.
The REFEDIT and XOPEN commands are not available in AutoCAD LT.
Editing a reference in-place
Starting the REFEDIT command displays the Reference Edit dialog box
(shown in Figure 3-4) and allows you to edit an xref or block in-place.
AutoCAD opens the xref or block for modification right where it’s inserted in
the drawing. This can be great when you want to modify the xref or block
based on surrounding objects in the drawing. When an xref or block is being
edited in-place, some commands are not available, such as SAVE, BEDIT, and
EXPORT.

To start the REFEDIT command and display the Reference Edit dialog box,
use one of the following methods:
✦On the ribbon, click Blocks & References tab➪References➪Edit In-Place.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Tools menu➪Xref and Block In-
Place Editing➪Edit Reference In-Place.
✦On the Refedit toolbar, click the Edit Reference In-Place button.
✦At the command prompt, type REFEDIT and press Enter.
✦Select an xref, right-click, and choose Edit Xref In-Place from the short-
cut menu.
✦Double-click the xref.
The following steps explain how to edit an xref in-place:
1. Use one of the previously mentioned methods to start the REFEDIT
command.
The following prompt is displayed at the command line:
Select reference:
2. At the prompt, select the xref you want to edit in-place.
The Reference Edit dialog box is displayed (refer to Figure 3-4).
3. On the Identify Reference tab, select the Automatically Select All
Nested Objects option.
This option selects all the objects in the xref, even any attributes that it
may contain.
4. Click the Settings tab to specify the additional settings you want to use
during in-place editing.

It’s best to have the following options selected:
• Create Unique Layer, Style, and Block Names: All layers and styles
used by the objects in the block have unique names while the in-
place editing session is active.
• Lock Objects Not in Working Set: Locks all objects in the drawing
that are not part of the selected block.
This way, you can easily identify which objects you are working with.
The Display Attribute Definitions for Editing option controls whether
attributes in the block definition are displayed during the in-place edit-
ing session.
5. Click OK.
The Reference Edit dialog box closes and the Edit Reference tab is dis-
played on the ribbon (or the Refedit toolbar is displayed if the ribbon is
not displayed). The ribbon and toolbar contain tools specific for editing
an xref in-place. All the objects that are not part of the xref are faded,
which allows you to identify which objects are in the xref.
6. Modify the objects you want to change.
You can add and remove objects from the xref. (On the ribbon, click Edit
Reference tab➪Edit Reference panel➪Xref and Block, Add to Working Set
or Xref and Block, Remove from Working. Or click the Add to Working
Set or Remove from Working Set button on the Refedit toolbar.)
7. On the ribbon, click Edit Reference tab➪Edit Reference panel➪Save
Changes (or Save Reference Edits on the Refedit toolbar) to save any
changes made.
A message box appears asking you to confirm the changes you made to
the xref.
8. In the AutoCAD message box, click OK to save the changes made.
The changes are committed back to the xref, and the in-place editing
session is closed. The xref is reloaded automatically.
The degree to which the background objects are faded is controlled by the
XFADECTL system variable. By default, the setting is 50.
Opening a reference
The XOPEN command (on the menu browser or menu bar, click Tools menu➪
Xref and Block In-place Editing➪Open Reference; or on the External References
palette, right-click a DWG reference and choose Open) open an xref in its
own drawing window, which enables you to use any editing commands with-
out the limitations of the REFEDIT command. After you save the changes to
the file that’s open for editing, the External Reference Notification is displayed,
which allows you to reload the external reference by clicking the link.

Clipping an xref
Clipping an xref enables you to control how much of the xref is displayed.
When working with large xrefs, loading the file can take a while. By clipping
an xref, you can reduce the amount of time it takes to load a drawing. The
XCLIP command controls the clipping boundary of an xref. The XCLIP com-
mand has the following options:
✦ON: Enables the clipping for an xref.
✦OFF: Disables the clipping for an xref.
✦Clipdepth: Controls the distance of the front and back clipping planes
from the clipping boundary. The option has the suboptions Front, Back,
Distance, and Remove.
✦Delete: Removes the clipping boundary for an xref.
✦Generate Polyline: Creates a polyline object based on an xref’s clipping
boundary.
✦New boundary: Adds a clipping boundary to the xref. You can create a
clipping boundary by picking two points (rectangular), creating a closed
polyline object by picking two or more points (polyline), or selecting a
closed polyline object. You can also invert how the objects of the xref
are displayed when the clipping boundary is created.
The XCLIP command is available only in AutoCAD. If you open a drawing that
contains a clipped xref in AutoCAD LT, the clipped boundary is maintained.
To start the XCLIP command, use one of the following methods:
✦On the ribbon, click Blocks & References➪Reference panel’s title
bar➪Clip Xref.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Modify menu➪Clip➪Xref.
✦On the Reference toolbar, click the Clip Xref button.
✦At the command prompt, type XCLIP or XC and press Enter.
✦Select an xref, right-click, and choose Xref Clip from the shortcut menu.
Clipping a drawing reference (xref)
The following steps explain how to clip an xref based on a rectangular
boundary:
1. Start the XCLIP command by using one of the methods in the 
preceding list.
The following prompt appears at the command line:
Select objects:

Book VI
Chapter 3
External References
Working with External References
459
2. At the prompt, select the xref that you want to clip and press Enter.
The following prompt appears at the command line:
Enter clipping option
[ON/OFF/Clipdepth/Delete/generate Polyline/New
boundary] <New>:
3. Press Enter to accept the default option of creating a new boundary.
The following prompt appears at the command line:
Specify clipping boundary:
[Select polyline/Polygonal/Rectangular/Invert clip]
<Rectangular>:
4. Press Enter to accept the default option of creating a rectangular clip-
ping boundary.
The following prompt appears at the command line:
Specify first corner:
5. Specify the first corner and then the opposite corner of the rectangu-
lar clipping boundary. The points should be outside the area of the
xref that you want left visible.
The command ends, and the xref is clipped based on the specified
rectangle.
The boundary that appears when you use the XCLIP command can be con-
trolled on the menu browser or menu bar by clicking Modify menu➪
Object➪External Reference➪Frame. By default, the frame is hidden.
Even though the XCLIP command is intended to be used with xrefs, you can
also use it to clip blocks.
Editing a clipped xref
You can modify the clipped boundary of an xref by running the XCLIP com-
mand again, or selecting the clip boundary and using grips to modify what is
displayed. You can use the XCLIP command to replace the clipping boundary
that is already assigned to the xref, remove the clip boundary, or turn the
clip boundary on or off. When grips are active for a clip boundary, you can
resize and adjust the boundary by moving the grip points or click the arrow
grip to invert the clipping boundary.
If you set the XCLIPFRAME system variable to a value of 0, you can’t use
grips to modify the clip boundary of an xref. If you set XCLIPFRAME to a
value of 1, you can modify the clip boundary of an xref.

Increasing the performance of xrefs
When you’re working with a number of xrefs or working with large xrefs, you
can do a few things to help increase performance. If you’re no longer using
some of the attached xrefs, the best thing to do is unload or detach the xref
through the External References palette. Unloading an xref keeps the link to
the external drawing file, but keeps all references to the xref in the drawing
and doesn’t just load the objects from the file into memory. To unload an
xref, select the xref in the File References area, right-click, and choose
Unload from the shortcut menu. You can use the Reload option from the
shortcut menu to load the xref back into the drawing if you need it later.
Detaching an xref severs the link to the external drawing file, and removes all
references of the xref from the drawing file.
Another way to increase the performance of working with Xrefs is to use a
process called demand load. Demand loading improves the overall perform-
ance of working with xrefs by loading only the part of the drawing that’s
needed. Demand loading can be changed by selecting an option from the
Demand Load Xrefs drop-down list in the External References (Xrefs) section
on the Open and Save tab of the Options dialog box. AutoCAD provides three
options for demand loading:
✦Disabled: Demand loading is turned off and the entire drawing is loaded.
✦Enabled: Demand loading is turned on and only the part of the drawing
that is required is loaded. This option locks the file so it can’t be edited
by others by opening it or by using the REFEDIT command.
✦Enable with copy: Demand loading is turned on and only the part of the
drawing that is required is loaded. This option also creates a copy of the
drawing file, and the copy gets loaded into AutoCAD. The original file is
not locked, so others can edit the file by opening it or by using the
REFEDIT command. This is the default option.
If you use demand loading, you can take advantage of indexing in your drawing
file. Indexing allows AutoCAD to locate specific objects and layers in a 
drawing that’s being referenced. AutoCAD offers two types of indexing: spatial
and layer. I talk more about spatial and layer indexing in Chapter 3 of Book VIII.
Binding an xref
An xref can be bound to its parent (or host) drawing. You can also bind select
named styles to an xref’s parent drawing. To integrate all the geometry and
named objects in an xref, right-click the xref that you want to bind in the File
References area on the External References palette and select Bind from the
shortcut menu. The Bind Xrefs dialog box appears, which allows you to
specify one of the two bind types: Bind or Insert.

Book VI
Chapter 3
External References
Working with External References
461
If you choose Bind for the bind type, the named objects in the xref are bound
with the name structure of
file name$#$symbol name
For example, if you bind an xref with the file name Grid Plan that has a layer
called Grid into a drawing, it is bound with the name Grid Plan$0$Grid. If you
choose Insert for the bind type, the same layer name as previously men-
tioned is just Grid. The named objects are merged cleanly into the existing
named objects of the parent drawing when the Insert bind type is used.
When you use the Insert option the resulting named objects are easier to
read but this can also be an issue. If a layer named Grid exists in the parent
drawing and also in the xref, the xref will take on the properties of the
parent’s Grid layer. This can cause the drawing to look and potentially plot
differently. The same holds true for other named objects, but the problem
shows up more with named objects such as text styles and dimension styles.
So based on how you look at it, the Insert bind type can be a good thing or
bad thing.
You can bind named objects from an xref attached to a drawing, but not any
objects in the xref, by using the XBIND command. The XBIND command dis-
plays the Xbind dialog box (see Figure 3-5). In the Xbind dialog box, expand
the xref in the Xrefs area and expand the node for the supported named
objects that you want to bind into the parent drawing. Select the named
object and click the Add -> button. The named object is added to the
Destinations to Bind area. Click OK to bind the selected named objects to
the parent drawing.

Raster Images
462
Raster Images
In addition to referencing drawing files, AutoCAD allows you to reference many
kinds of raster images. You may want to reference a raster image that holds a
company logo, an aerial view of a new subdivision, or a rendered image of a
model. Raster images are files that are made up of a series of dots, which are
referred to as pixels. AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT are vector-based programs,
which means they store objects in the form of coordinate values and properties
to regenerate the objects when the file is opened, viewed, or plotted. Raster
images are referenced into a drawing the same way that you reference a drawing
file. Unlike xrefs, raster images can’t be bound to a drawing. You use the External
References palette to attach, reload, unload, and detach raster images.
AutoCAD LT 2009 allows you to attach raster images with the External
References palette or the IMAGEATTACH command.
Attaching a raster image
To attach raster images to a drawing, you use the External References
palette or the IMAGEATTACH command. During the attachment process, you
need to determine where in the drawing the image should be placed, its
scale and rotation, and the path type that you want to use. When an image is
scaled, it can appear grainy on-screen; when plotted, the graininess is due to
how the image was created and its DPI (dots per inch) property. The greater
the DPI, the larger the image can be scaled before it starts to appear grainy.
To start the IMAGEATTACH command and display the Image dialog box, use
one of these methods:
✦On the ribbon, click Blocks & References tab➪Reference panel➪Image.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Insert menu➪Raster Image
Reference.
✦On the Reference or Insert toolbar, click the Attach Image button.
✦At the command prompt, type IMAGEATTACH or IAT and press Enter.
✦On the External References palette, right-click over the File References
area and choose Attach Image from the shortcut menu.
To attach a raster image to your drawing, follow these steps. For more infor-
mation on some of the options in the Image dialog box, see the “Attaching an
xref” section earlier in this chapter.
1. Start the IMAGEATTACH command by using one of the methods in the
preceding list.
The Select Image File dialog box appears.

Book VI
Chapter 3
External References
Raster Images
463
2. Browse to the raster image file that you want to attach and select it.
Use the Files of Type drop-down list to filter the displayed files in the
dialog box. Click Open.
The Select Image File dialog box closes, and the Image dialog box (see
Figure 3-6) is displayed. The path to and the name of the file you selected
appear in the Found In and Saved Path fields, respectively. The Name
drop-down list allows you to select a previously attached raster image file,
and Browse allows you to specify a different raster image file to reference.
3. Click Details to display additional information about the selected
image.
The Image Information area provides feedback on how the image will be
scaled when it’s inserted. AutoCAD automatically calculates the number
of pixels by the current units to determine the size of the image when
it’s inserted. The current AutoCAD units are determined by the setting in
the Insertion Scale area of the Units dialog box. You use the UNITS com-
mand to display the Units dialog box.
4. In the Path Type area, specify the path format that should be main-
tained when attaching the raster image.
5. In the Insertion Point area, specify how and where the image should
be inserted.
6. In the Scale area, specify how the image should be scaled.
7. In the Rotation area, specify how the image should be rotated.
8. Click OK.
The Image dialog box closes and you are returned to the drawing
window. The IMAGEATTACH command may still be running depending
on whether you selected any of the Specify On-Screen options for the

insertion point, scale, or rotation. The following prompts might be
displayed:
Specify insertion point <0,0>:
Specify scale factor or [Unit] <1>:
Specify rotation angle <0>:
Clipping a raster image
Like xrefs, raster images can be clipped to show only part of the image. Only
showing what is necessary in the drawing can help to save time when you
need to regenerate the drawing during panning or zooming, especially if a
large image is attached, because only the necessary section of the image is
displayed. The IMAGECLIP command controls the clipping boundary of a
raster image. The IMAGECLIP command has the same options as the XCLIP
command, with the exceptions of Generate Polyline, Select Polyline, and
Invert Clip options.
To start the IMAGECLIP command, do one of the following:
✦On the ribbon, click Blocks & References➪Reference panel’s title
bar➪Clip Image.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Modify menu➪Clip➪Image.
✦On the Reference toolbar, click the Clip Image button.
✦At the command prompt type IMAGECLIP or IC and press Enter.
✦Select a raster image and right-click, and then choose Image➪Clip.
Clip a raster image
The following steps explain how to clip a raster image based on a rectangular
boundary:
1. Start the IMAGECLIP command by using one of the methods in the
preceding list.
2. At the Select image to clip: prompt, select the raster image you want
to clip and press Enter.
3. Press Enter to accept the default option for creating a new boundary
or select one of the other available options.
4. Press Enter to accept the default option for creating a rectangular clip-
ping boundary or select the other available option.
5. Specify the first corner and then the opposite corner of the rectangu-
lar clipping boundary.
The points should be outside the area of the image you want left visible.

The boundary displayed before and after you use the IMAGECLIP command
can be controlled on the menu browser or menu bar by clicking Modify menu➪
Object➪Image➪Frame (which starts the IMAGEFRAME command). The visibil-
ity of all the image frames is toggled on and off. By default the frame is dis-
played and plotted. You have three options to control how the frame should be
displayed: 0, the frame is not displayed and is not plotted, 1, the frame is dis-
played and is plotted, and 2, the frame is displayed and is not plotted.
You can use the IMAGEFRAME command and a value of 0 to lock images so
they can’t be selected.
Editing a clipped raster image
You can modify the clipped boundary of a raster image by running the
IMAGECLIP command again or by selecting the clip boundary and using
grips to modify its size and shape to control what part of the image is dis-
played. You can use the IMAGECLIP command to replace the clipping bound-
ary that is already assigned to the image, remove the clip boundary, or turn
the clip boundary on or off. IMAGEFRAME must be set to a value of 1 or 2 to
select the image so that the clipped boundary can be modified.
In AutoCAD only (sorry AutoCAD LT users), you can use the IMAGEEDIT
command that comes with the Express Tools to open a raster image in an
external image-editing application such as MS Paint or Adobe PhotoShop.
The IMAGEEDIT command opens the selected raster image reference in the
system default editor unless the IMAGEAPP command is used to specify a
different image editor application. You can start the IMAGEEDIT command
on the menu browser or menu bar by clicking Express menu➪File Tools➪
Edit Image. The IMAGEAPP command can be run only from the command
prompt.
Controlling the appearance of a raster image
AutoCAD allows you to tweak an image after it’s attached to a drawing. You
can alter the appearance of an image by changing its level of brightness, con-
trast, or fade. You can use the Properties palette or the IMAGEADJUST com-
mand (select the image, right-click, and choose Image➪Adjust). The IMAGEAD
JUST command displays the Image Adjust dialog box (see Figure 3-7) for con-
trolling the brightness, contrast, or fade levels of the selected image, and as the
values are changed, the preview in the dialog box is updated. If you use the
Properties palette, the changes are applied dynamically to the image 
in the drawing window.

DWF and DWFx Underlays
466
If you have a fairly large image, it can slow down the regeneration process of
the drawing. You can clip the image, but this is not always an option,
depending on the drawing you’re working on. The IMAGEQUALITY command
(on the menu browser or menu bar, click Modify menu➪Object➪Image➪
Quality) allows you to control the quality of the image that you see on-screen.
You can choose from either High or Draft; selecting Draft can help to decrease
the amount of time it takes to regenerate the display of the drawing. This set-
ting does not affect plotting because plotting is always done at High quality. If
your attached image type supports transparency, you can control whether the
image is displayed as transparent so objects beneath it are displayed. The
TRANSPARENCY command (select the image, right-click, and choose Image➪
Transparency) allows you to toggle transparency for an image on or off.
DWF and DWFx Underlays
Design Web Format (DWF and DWFx) files are commonly used for exchang-
ing drawings in a secure electronic format that non-CAD users can use to
view, print, and mark up with Autodesk Design Review 2009, which is a free
viewer that can be downloaded from Autodesk.com. DWF, DWFx, and draw-
ing files are vector-based files, unlike raster images, which are made up of
pixels. When a DWF or DWFx file is attached to a drawing, it is known as an
underlay.
Because DWF and DWFx files are vector-based files, AutoCAD allows you to
snap to the objects that are part of a DWF or DWFx underlay. Unlike an xref,
a DWF or DWFx file can’t be bound to a drawing file, which helps to maintain
the file’s security. I talk about how to create and view DWF and DWFx files in
Book VIII. In this chapter, when I refer to DWF files, I am talking about both
DWF and DWFx unless otherwise noted. You use the External References
palette to attach, reload, unload, and detach DWF underlays.
AutoCAD 2009 and AutoCAD LT 2009 support the creation of DWFx files,
which is the next evolutionary step of the DWF file format. DWFx is an XPS-
compliant format that allows someone with Internet Explorer 7 or Vista the
ability to view the file without having to download additional software.

Attaching a DWF underlay
To attach a DWF file to a drawing, you use the External References palette or
the DWFATTACH command. When you attach a DWF file, you need to deter-
mine where in the drawing the DWF underlay should be placed, its scale and
rotation, the path type that should be used, and which one of the sheets in
the DWF file is being referenced. Attaching DWF files is limited to 2D DWF
files only; if you select a 3D DWF file, AutoCAD informs you that the selected
file doesn’t contain any sheets that can be attached. Layer information is
imported into the drawing when a DWF file is attached as long as the layer
information was published to the DWF file.
When a DWF underlay is attached to a drawing, it’s placed on the current
layer. However, you may be able to control the display of the objects in the
DWF underlay based on whether the DWF file was published with the origi-
nal drawing’s layer information. You use the DWGLAYERS command to turn
on and off the display of objects on a layer in a DWF underlay. The DWFLAY-
ERS command displays the DWF Layers dialog box (see Figure 3-8), which
allows you to turn the display of a layer on or off by clicking the light bulb
icon next to the layer name in the dialog box. To display the DWF Layers
dialog box, enter DWFLAYERS at the command prompt, or select a DWF
underlay, right-click, and choose DWF Layers from the shortcut menu.
To start the DWFATTACH command and display the Attach DWF Underlay
dialog box, do one of the following:
✦On the ribbon, click Blocks & References tab➪Reference panel➪DWF.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Insert menu➪DWF Underlay.
✦On the Insert toolbar, click the Insert a DWF Underlay button.
✦At the command prompt, type DWFATTACH and press Enter.
✦On the External References palette, right-click the File References area
and choose Attach DWF from the shortcut menu.

To attach a DWF file, use the following steps. (For more information on some
of the options in the Attach DWF Underlay dialog box, see the “Attaching an
xref” section.)
1. Start the DWFATTACH command by using of the methods in the
preceding list.
The Select DWF File dialog box appears.
2. Browse to and select the DWF file that you want to attach. Click Open.
The Select DWF File dialog box closes, and the Attach DWF Underlay
dialog box (see Figure 3-9) is displayed. The path to and the name of the
file you selected appear in the Found In and Saved Path fields, respec-
tively. The Name drop-down list allows you to select a previously
attached DWF file, and Browse allows you to specify a different DWF file
to reference.
3. In the Select a Sheet from the DWF File list box, select a sheet.
The selected sheet is highlighted and is the one that will be attached.
4. In the Path Type area, specify the path format that should be main-
tained when attaching the DWF underlay.
5. In the Insertion Point area, specify how and where the DWF underlay
should be inserted.
6. In the Scale area, specify how the DWF underlay should be scaled.
7. In the Rotation area, specify how the DWF underlay should be
rotated.

The DWF Attach Underlay dialog box closes, and you’re returned to the
drawing window. The DWFATTACH command may still be running,
depending on whether you selected any of the Specify On-Screen
options for the insertion point, scale, or rotation. The following prompts
might be displayed:
Specify insertion point:
Specify scale factor or [Unit] <1.0000>:
Specify rotation angle <0>:
Only one sheet from a DWF file can be attached at a time. If you need to
attach multiple sheets from a DWF file, you must repeat the preceding steps
for each of the sheets that you want to attach.
The DWFOSNAP system variable controls whether object snaps can be used
on objects that are part of a DWF underlay. By default, you can use object
snaps with DWF underlays. Set the DWFOSNAP system variable to a value of 0
(zero) to disable the use of object snaps with DWF underlays, or 1 to enable
the use of object snaps with DWF underlays. When using object snaps to snap
to objects in a DWF file, the tooltip for an object snap is prefixed with the text
DWF (approximate):. The approximate reminds you that while DWF files can
be used as referenced geometry, the objects in the file lack the precision that
might be necessary for some designs. The precision of the objects in the DWF
file are set during the plotting or publishing of the source drawing file.
Clipping a DWF underlay
DWF underlays can be clipped just like xrefs to show only part of the refer-
enced sheet. The DWFCLIP command is used to control the clipping bound-
ary of a DWF underlay. The DWFCLIP command has the same options as the
XCLIP command, with the exception of the Generate Polyline, Select
Polyline, and Invert Clip options.
To start the DWFCLIP command, do one of the following:
✦On the ribbon, click Blocks & References➪Reference panel’s title
bar➪Clip DWF.
✦At the command prompt, type DWFCLIP and press Enter.
✦Select a DWF underlay, right-click, and then choose DWF Clip from the
shortcut menu.
Clip a DWF underlay
To start the DWFCLIP command and clip a DWF underlay based on a rectan-
gular boundary, follow these steps:
1. Start the DWFCLIP command by using one of the methods in the pre-
ceding list.

2. Press Enter to accept the default option of creating a new boundary or
select one of the other available options.
3. Press Enter to accept the default option of creating a rectangular clip-
ping boundary or select the other available option.
4. Specify the first corner and then the opposite corner of the rectangu-
lar clipping boundary.
The points should be outside the area of the DWF underlay that you
want visible.
You can control the boundary that’s displayed before and after you use the
DWFCLIP command by using the DWFFRAME system variable. The DWF-
FRAME system variable controls the display of the frames for all DWF under-
lays in a drawing. By default the frame is displayed and not plotted. You
have three options to control how the frame should be displayed: 0, the
frame is not displayed and is not plotted, 1, the frame is displayed and is
plotted, and 2, the frame is displayed and is not plotted.
Editing a clipped DWF underlay
You can modify the clipped boundary of a DWF underlay by running the
DWFCLIP command again, or by selecting the clip boundary and using grips
to modify its size and shape to control what is displayed of the DWF under-
lay. You can use the DWFCLIP command to replace the clipping boundary
that is already assigned to the DWF underlay, remove the clip boundary, or
turn the clip boundary on or off.
Controlling the appearance of DWF underlay
AutoCAD allows you to adjust the appearance of the objects of a DWF under-
lay by changing its level of brightness, contrast, or fade. You can use the
Properties palette or the DWFADJUST command. The DWFADJUST com-
mand, unlike the IMAGEADJUST command, works only from the command
prompt. If you use the Properties palette, the changes are applied dynami-
cally to the DWF underlay right in the drawing window.
DGN Underlays
Design (DGN) files are created with Bentley’s MicroStation. DGN files are
commonly used when exchanging files with users who work in the civil and
infrastructure industries but can be found in AEC industry as well. DGN files
such as DWF, DWFx, and drawing files are vector-based files. When a DGN file
is attached to a drawing, just like a DWF file, it is known as an underlay.
Because DGN files are vector-based files, AutoCAD allows you to snap to the
objects that are part of a DGN underlay. Unlike xrefs, a DGN file can’t be

bound to a drawing file. You use the External References palette to attach,
reload, unload, and detach DGN underlays.
AutoCAD 2009 and AutoCAD LT 2009 support the ability to import and attach
V7 DGN files.
Attaching a DGN underlay
To attach a DGN file to a drawing, you use the External References palette or
the DGNATTACH command. When you attach a DGN file, you need to determine
where in the drawing the DGN underlay should be placed, its scale and rota-
tion, the path type that should be used, which one of the models in the DGN file
is being referenced, and the units that should be used for the conversion. Layer
information is imported into the drawing when a DGN file is attached. The
layers that come in from a DGN file are not managed with the Layers Properties
Manager palette like layers in the parent drawing or xrefs are.
To control the display of the objects in a DGN underlay, you use the DGN-
LAYERS command. The DGNLAYERS command displays the DGN Layers
dialog box (see Figure 3-10), which allows you to turn the display of a layer
on or off by clicking the light bulb icon next to the layer name in the dialog
box. To display the DGN Layers dialog box, enter DGNLAYERS at the com-
mand prompt, or select a DGN underlay, right-click, and choose DGN Layers
from the shortcut menu.
To start the DGNATTACH command and display the Attach DGN Underlay
dialog box, do one of the following:
✦On the ribbon, click Blocks & References tab➪Reference panel➪DGN.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Insert menu➪DGN Underlay.

2. In the Select DGN File dialog box, browse to and select the DGN file
that you want to attach. Click Open.
The Select DGN File dialog box closes, and the Attach DGN Underlay
dialog box (see Figure 3-11) is displayed. The path to and the name of
the file you selected appear in the Found In and Saved Path fields. The
Name drop-down list allows you to select a previously attached DGN file,
and Browse allows you to specify a different DGN file to reference.
3. In the Select a Design Model from the DGN File list box, select a
model.
The selected model is highlighted and is the one that will be attached.
4. In the Conversion Units area, choose Master Units or Sub Units.
These options control which unit AutoCAD uses for the conversion of
the objects in the DGN file to the current drawing.

should be inserted.
7. In the Scale area, specify how the DGN underlay should be scaled.
8. In the Rotation area, specify how the DGN underlay should be rotated.
9. Click OK.
The DGN Attach Underlay dialog box closes, and you’re returned to the
drawing window. The DGNATTACH command may still be running,
depending on whether you selected any of the Specify On-Screen
options for the insertion point, scale, or rotation. The following prompts
might be displayed:
Specify insertion point:
Specify scale factor or [Unit] <12.0000>:
Specify rotation angle <0>:
Only one model from a DGN file can be attached at a time. If you need to
attach multiple models from a DGN file, repeat the preceding steps for each
of the models you want to attach.
The DGNOSNAP system variable controls whether object snaps can be used
on objects that are part of a DGN underlay. By default, you can use object snaps
with DGN underlays. Set the DGNOSNAP system variable to a value of 0 (zero)
to disable the use of object snaps with DGN underlays, or 1 to enable the use of
object snaps with DGN underlays. When using object snaps to snap to objects
in a DGN file, the tooltip for an object snap is prefixed with the text DGN:.
Clipping a DGN underlay
DGN underlays can be clipped just like xrefs, DWF underlays, and raster
images to show only part of the referenced model. The DGNCLIP command
is used to control the clipping boundary of a DGN underlay. The DGNCLIP
command has the same options as the XCLIP command, with the exceptions
of the Generate Polyline, Select Polyline, and Invert Clip options.
To start the DGNCLIP command, do one of the following:

Clip a DGN underlay
To start the DGNCLIP command and clip a DGN underlay based on a rectan-
gular boundary, follow these steps:
1. Start the DGNCLIP command by using one of the methods in the pre-
ceding list.
2. Press Enter to accept the default option of creating a new boundary or
select one of the other available options.
3. Press Enter to accept the default option of creating a rectangular clip-
ping boundary or select the other available option.
4. Specify the first corner and then the opposite corner of the rectangu-
lar clipping boundary.
The points should be outside the area of the DGN underlay that you
want visible.
You can control the boundary that’s displayed before and after you use the
DGNCLIP command by using the DGNFRAME system variable. The DGN-
FRAME system variable controls the display of the frames for all DGN under-
lays in a drawing. By default the frame is displayed and not plotted. You
have three options to control how the frame should be displayed: 0, the
frame is not displayed and is not plotted, 1, the frame is displayed and is
plotted, and 2, the frame is displayed and is not plotted.
Editing a clipped DGN underlay
You can modify the clipped boundary of a DGN underlay by running the
DGNCLIP command again, or by selecting the clip boundary and using grips
to modify its size and shape to control what’s displayed of the DGN underlay.
You can use the DGNCLIP command to replace the clipping boundary that is
already assigned to the DGN underlay, remove the clip boundary, or turn the
clip boundary on or off.
Controlling the appearance of a DGN underlay
AutoCAD allows you to adjust the appearance of the objects of a DGN under-
lay by changing its level of brightness, contrast, or fade. You can use the
Properties palette or the DGNADJUST command. The DGNADJUST com-
mand, unlike the IMAGEADJUST and DWFADJUST commands, works only
from the command prompt. If you use the Properties palette, the changes
are applied dynamically to the DGN underlay right in the drawing window.

475
Draw Order
Draw order determines how objects are displayed on-screen and how they
are plotted. When you draw new objects, they’re placed at the top of the
draw order and therefore appear above other objects in the drawing.
AutoCAD provides several commands that allow you to control the draw
order of objects in the drawing. You use the DRAWORDER and TEXT-
TOFRONT commands to help control the order in which objects are dis-
played. For example, you can use the DRAWORDER command to display
objects on top of a raster image or text in front of other objects when it is
assigned a background mask so that it hides the objects that need to be
masked out below the text.
The DRAWORDER command has four options that allow you to bring objects
all the way to the front, send them all the way to the back, or bring them up
in front or behind selected objects. When working with external referenced
files, you may need to control the display of hatched areas as well as other
objects to make sure they display correctly. The TEXTTOFRONT command
allows you to quickly bring all text or dimensions or both to the front. If
you’re using fills or background masks with your text and dimensions, you
want to make sure that they’re all the way at the top of the display order to
make sure that all objects below them are properly masked.
Object Linking and Embedding (OLE)
Object linking and embedding — or OLE as it’s often referred to — allows
you to place information from one Windows-based application into another
while retaining the ability to edit the information by using the original appli-
cation. For example, you can link information from a spreadsheet and display
it in AutoCAD. Then if the spreadsheet is updated, the changes are reflected
in AutoCAD the next time the drawing file is loaded. You use the INSERTOBJ
command to insert and link a document into a drawing. The INSERTOBJ com-
mand displays the Insert Object dialog box (see Figure 3-12).

2. Select the Create from File option.
Create from File allows you to link to an existing file. Create New enables
you to link to a newly created file.
3. Select the Link check box.
This way, you keep a live link between the drawing and the selected file.
4. Click Browse and then select the word processing document or the
file that you want to link to in your drawing. After you select the file,
click Open to return to the Insert Object dialog box.
This way, you keep a live link between the drawing and the selected file.
5. Click OK and the document is placed into the drawing.
The document is placed in the upper-left corner of the drawing window.
After an OLE object is placed in the drawing, you can modify it by using many
of the standard AutoCAD commands. If you want to edit the document, you
can either double-click the object or select the OLE object, right-click, and
then choose an option from the OLE submenu. OLE objects can’t be rotated
and are plotted best when using a system printer rather than a plotter.
Managing External References Outside AutoCAD
Managing external references in one drawing is not too difficult, but trying to
manage them across 10, 20, or 100 drawings can be a big challenge. To help
manage external references, you can use a utility called Reference Manager.
From the name, you can tell that it must do something with external refer-
ences. Reference Manager allows you to modify the paths of external refer-
ences attached to drawing files that you might create or receive from a

contractor. This can make updating the locations of external references
much easier than having to open each file one by one and then update the
external references’ locations. Reference Manager enables you to update the
locations of xrefs, DWF and DGN underlays, raster images, plotter configura-
tions, plot styles, shapes, and font files.
Reference Manager is available only with AutoCAD and not with AutoCAD LT.
Follow these steps to access and edit the dependency files of a drawing
through Reference Manager:
1. Click Start (Windows button)➪[All] Programs➪Autodesk➪AutoCAD
2009➪Reference Manager.
The Reference Manager dialog box appears (see Figure 3-13).
2. Click Add Drawings.
The Add Drawings dialog box appears.
3. Browse and select the drawing files in which you want to check or
edit the dependencies. Click Open.
The Reference Manager — Add Xrefs dialog box is displayed.
Red slash indicates missing reference file

The selected files are added to the tree view in Reference Manager.
5. If a slash appears through the drawing icon in the tree view, the file
has a problem. Select the drawing, and all the dependencies for the
drawing appear in the list view on the right.
A blue check mark means the dependency file was found; a red exclama-
tion point means the file was not found.
6. Double-click an item that has a status of Not Found, indicated by a red
exclamation point, to fix the path to the file.
The Edit Selected Paths dialog box is displayed.
7. Click the ellipsis button to browse for the folder in which the file is
located. Select the folder and click OK.
The selected folder appears in the New Saved Path text box.
8. Click OK.
The item you double-clicked should now have the status of Resolved
with a blue check mark in front of it with a pencil. The pencil shows
which dependencies you have edited during the current session of
Reference Manager.
9. Keep editing any dependencies that need to be updated. When you
have finished updating the dependencies, click Apply Changes (at the
top of Reference Manager).
The Summary message box is displayed and provides information about the
number of host and reference drawings that have been updated successfully
and the number of files that could not be updated. Click OK to close the
Summary message box or click Details to figure out why a file could not be
updated.
10. Choose File menu➪Exit.
Reference Manager closes. If you didn’t apply the changes, you’re
prompted to do so. Click Yes to save the changes, No to discard the
changes, or Cancel to stay in Reference Manager.

A
utoCAD enables you to create content once and then reuse it in other
drawings. Being able to create reusable content is one thing, but being
able to organize and manage all that reusable content is another. AutoCAD
offers many ways to manage and organize usable content. You can use the
Windows Clipboard to transfer content between two open drawings or to
another Windows-based application. It’s not always efficient to open a draw-
ing just to access its content, so AutoCAD comes with two interfaces to help
you access content from drawings that might be saved locally on your com-
puter or on a network drive. These two interfaces are called DesignCenter
and tool palettes.
Why Bother to Organize Drawings?
It takes time to develop accurate drawings, but you can make the process 
go faster and faster over time. By creating good CAD standards and high-
quality reusable content, you can improve your efficiency. I talk about CAD
standards in detail in Book VIII, but for now, I address the importance of
properly naming and managing reusable content.
Many things in AutoCAD that can be reused, such as a text style, a layer, or
even a layout, are given a name. It’s a good idea to keep these names mean-
ingful so that you or anyone else looking at the name can decipher its
intended purpose. At times this can cause problems; obviously, if you’re
sharing drawings with other clients, you’ll most likely both have a title block
in your drawings. It’s a good idea to prefix or suffix your blocks with text
that denotes scale, units, or even a company identifier to avoid problems
with duplicate names. This not only avoids problems when exchanging
drawings with other contractors and clients, but also helps you when
searching for named objects in your own drawings.

block by company ABC might be TitleBlock-A-ABC. Now this is only a recom-
mendation that I have observed through the years of exchanging drawings
with other companies. There’s nothing wrong with calling your title block TB
or TitleBlock, but you do run the risk of a naming conflict with just a generic
name. No matter how you decide to name objects, it’s a good idea to develop
a naming convention and make sure everyone in your company follows it.
Doing so makes managing CAD drawings much easier.
Using the Windows Clipboard
AutoCAD is a Windows-based application, and like most Windows-based
applications, AutoCAD is capable of using the Windows Clipboard to
exchange information between two applications. The two applications may
be two instances of AutoCAD, or AutoCAD and another Windows-based
application such as Microsoft Word. You can copy or cut objects from a
drawing and place them on the Windows Clipboard. From there, you can
paste them into AutoCAD or another application. You can also copy informa-
tion from other Windows-based applications and paste that information into
an open drawing.
Copying objects from a drawing
You can copy objects to the Windows Clipboard in a couple of ways. You can
do a basic copy of selected objects in the drawing window by using the
COPYCLIP command, pressing the standard keyboard shortcut Ctrl+C, or
clicking Home tab➪Utilities panel➪Copy flyout➪Copy Clip on the ribbon.
When you use COPYCLIP on objects in a drawing, AutoCAD copies the
objects to the Windows Clipboard and calculates an insertion point to use
when pasting the copied objects from the Clipboard. The insertion point is
based on the lower-left corner of the extents of the selected objects, also
known as the bounding box of the selected objects.
If you want control over choosing the insertion point of the copied objects,
you can use the COPYBASE command, press the keyboard shortcut
Ctrl+Shift+C, or click Home tab➪Utilities panel➪Copy flyout➪Copy with
Base Point on the ribbon. If you’re not concerned with accurate placement,
you can copy objects within the same drawing or between two drawings by
dragging them on-screen with the left mouse button. If you select the objects
without any command running and start dragging the objects, they’re moved
if you release the mouse button. But if you hold the Ctrl key while dragging
the objects, a plus sign appears near the crosshairs, allowing you to copy
the objects instead of moving them.

Cutting objects from a drawing
Copying objects in your drawing or between files by using the Windows
Clipboard is nice, but at times you may just want to cut (or move) objects.
To cut objects from one drawing and place them onto the Windows
Clipboard, use the CUTCLIP command, press Ctrl+X, or click Home
tab➪Utilities panel➪Cut from the ribbon. When you use CUTCLIP on objects
in a drawing, AutoCAD moves the objects to the Windows Clipboard and cal-
culates an insertion point to use when pasting the copied objects from the
Clipboard. The insertion point is based on the lower-left corner of the
bounding box for the selected objects.
AutoCAD doesn’t provide a cut operation that is similar to the COPYBASE
command. You can cut objects within the same drawing by dragging them
on-screen with the left mouse button. If you select the objects without any
command running and start dragging the objects, they’re moved when you
release the mouse button.
Pasting objects into a drawing
After you place objects on the Windows Clipboard, you can paste them into
a drawing or into another Windows-based application. The pasted results
vary based on the application into which you are pasting the objects. You
can choose from three options to paste between drawings. The first is a 
standard paste, which doesn’t give you much control over the placement of
the objects you are pasting. This option of paste is started by using the
PASTECLIP command, pressing Ctrl+V, or clicking Home tab➪Utilities panel➪
Paste flyout➪Paste from the ribbon. If you used the COPYBASE command,
you already know the insertion point of the objects being pasted back into
AutoCAD. If you used COPYCLIP or CUTCLIP, you don’t know the insertion
point until you begin pasting the objects into the drawing.
The second option for pasting is to paste objects to their original coordinates
where they were before they were copied or cut to the Windows Clipboard.
This option of paste is started by the PASTEORIG command. This can be
useful when copying and pasting title blocks between layouts or drawings.
The final option of pasting content between drawings is the ability to paste
the contents of the Windows Clipboard as a block. This option of paste is
started by using the PASTEBLOCK command, pressing Ctrl+Shift+V, or click-
ing Home tab➪Utilities panel➪Paste flyout➪Paste as Block on the ribbon.
If you’re pasting objects from other Windows-based applications, you may
want to use the PASTESPEC command. Using this command, you can define
how objects on the Windows Clipboard are pasted into AutoCAD. For example,
if you copy cells in a spreadsheet program to the Windows Clipboard, you can

paste the copied cells into AutoCAD as a table object. You can find all the
Paste commands on the menu browser or menu bar by clicking the Edit menu,
or on the ribbon by clicking Home tab➪Utilities panel➪Paste flyout.
AutoCAD DesignCenter
AutoCAD DesignCenter is an interface that allows you to perform data
mining. Data mining is a popular buzz phrase in the marketing world, but
you can do it with AutoCAD drawings, as well. Data mining allows you to
locate information that is of importance to you and reuse it. In marketing,
data mining might determine whether a product will sell to a targeted audi-
ence; in AutoCAD, you are mining your data for reusable content in the form
of drawings, images, layers, blocks, and other named objects.
DesignCenter (see Figure 4-1) was introduced in AutoCAD 2000, and was
born out of an AutoCAD LT feature called Content Explorer. It allows you to
access content that is stored in a drawing, a hatch pattern, a linetype pat-
tern, and image files, and then reuse the content in any drawing that you
have open or add it to a tool palette. You use the ADCENTER command to
display DesignCenter.

To start the ADCENTER command and display the DesignCenter palette, do
one of the following:
✦On the ribbon, click View tab➪Palettes panel➪DesignCenter.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Tools
menu➪Palettes➪DesignCenter.
✦On the Standard or Standard Annotation toolbar, click the DesignCenter
button.
✦At the command prompt, type ADCENTER or ADC and press Enter.
✦Press Ctrl+2.
Locating resources in drawings
By using DesignCenter, you can access content in a number of ways. You can
access content that has or has not been opened in AutoCAD. The content
can be stored locally on your computer, on a network, or even in an online
library of blocks. To locate information by browsing, you use one of the four
tabs along the top of the DesignCenter palette:
✦Folders: Browse your local and network drives for drawing or image files.
✦Open Drawings: Access any drawing files currently open.
✦History: Access any drawing files that have been recently opened during
the current AutoCAD session.
✦DC Online: Access blocks from an online portal hosted by Autodesk.
The online portal has many different 2D and 3D blocks available for use
in your drawings, and they’re organized into categories to make it easier
to find which blocks you might be interested in.
Browsing for content is not always the most efficient way to find something,
especially when you don’t remember exactly which drawing file something
might be located in. Well, you are in luck; DesignCenter has a search feature
that allows you to look for drawings that contain specific content. Maybe
there is a drawing with a block in it that you want to use in your current
drawing; it is possible to search for that block based on a wild character
string. Click the Search button on the DesignCenter toolbar to display the
Search dialog box (see Figure 4-2).

AutoCAD DesignCenter
484
To search for a block, follow these steps:
1. Start the ADCENTER command by using one of the previously men-
tioned methods.
The DesignCenter palette appears.
2. In the DesignCenter palette, click Search.
The Search dialog box appears.
3. In the Look For drop-down list, select Blocks.
Normally, you select the type of content that you want to search for in
the Look For drop-down list. The type of content selected from the Look
For drop-down list controls many of the available options in the Search
dialog box.
4. Either select a folder in the In drop-down list to scan for content, or
click Browse and browse to the location where you want to start scan-
ning for content.
If you click Browse, the Browse for Folder dialog box appears. Browse
to the folder you want to select in the Browse for Folder dialog box,
select the folder, and then click OK. You can also deselect the Search
Subfolders option to limit the scanning for content in the folder that you
select.
5. In the Search for the Name text box, enter the block name for which
you want search.
You can use wild characters to help broaden the search if you don’t
quite remember the name of the block. A pound (#) symbol replaces a
single character or an asterisk (*) replaces a range of characters.

6. Click Search Now.
The search results appear at the bottom of the dialog box.
7. Click Stop to end the search early if you found what you were looking
for, or wait until the search has completed.
8. Right-click the content you want to place in the drawing or load into
the Content Area of DesignCenter.
Based on the content for which you were searching, the options vary on
the right-click menu. You can choose Add to load the selected content
into the current drawing or Load into Content Area to browse to the con-
tent in DesignCenter.
9. Click the Close button (X) in the Search dialog box to close it, or leave
the dialog box displayed so you can continue to search for other con-
tent later if necessary.
10. Click the Close button (X) in DesignCenter to close it, or leave it 
displayed.
Adding resources to drawings
After you find the content you want by using one of the four tabs or the Search
dialog box, you can add it to a drawing. Position DesignCenter so that you
can see the drawing window that you want to drop the content into, and then
select the icon that represents the content from the content area (refer to
Figure 4-1). Press and hold the left mouse button over the icon and drag it
over the drawing window. Release the mouse button to insert the selected
block into a drawing or add one of the other types of named objects to a
drawing window. AutoCAD ignores duplicate named objects.
To add a block to a drawing, follow these steps:
1. Start the ADCENTER command by using one of the previously mentioned
methods.
The DesignCenter palette is displayed.
2. In the DesignCenter palette, click the Folders tab.
The Folders tab and Folders List tree view appear. If they do not, click
the Tree View toggle button along the top of the DesignCenter palette.
3. In the Folders List tree view, browse to the folder that contains the
drawing with the block you want to add to your drawing.
The Folders List tree view is similar to Windows Explorer.
4. When you locate the drawing that contains the block you want to
place in your drawing, select the drawing.

Using the Tool Palettes Window
486
The available named objects are displayed in the content area to the
right of the Folders List tree view.
5. In the content area, double-click the Blocks icon.
Icons for the blocks in the drawing are displayed in the content area.
6. Right-click the icon for the block that you want to insert in the draw-
ing and select Insert Block.
The Insert dialog box appears.
7. In the Insert dialog box, select the options you want and click OK to
place the block. Follow any command prompts that are displayed.
You can also drag and drop the block from the content area into a draw-
ing, but you don’t have as much control over the block’s placement.
8. Click the Close button (X) on DesignCenter to close it, or leave it 
displayed.
Inserting hatches and loading linetypes
Hatch patterns can be dragged and dropped from DesignCenter. Using the
Folders tab, you can browse to a folder that contains hatch pattern (PAT)
files. By default the hatch pattern files that come with AutoCAD are in the
following folder:
C:\Documents and Settings\<user name>\Application
Data\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2009 (or AutoCAD LT 2009)\R17.2 (or
R14.0)\enu\Support
The <user name> varies based on what your Windows login. Select the hatch
pattern file from the Folders List tree view, and then drag and drop the pat-
tern from the content area into a closed boundary in your drawing to create
a hatch object. You can load linetypes from a linetype pattern (LIN) file in
the same way you drag and drop hatch patterns into a drawing.
Using the Tool Palettes Window
The Tool Palettes window is an interface that allows you to organize reusable
content on palettes of tools. These palettes of tools can be used to reference
existing content such as blocks, xrefs, or images, and even custom commands.
Tool palettes can be organized so that they can be shared across the company
with other drafters, making it easy to develop and maintain CAD standards
with them. The Tool Palettes window (see Figure 4-3) was introduced in
AutoCAD 2004. You use the TOOLPALETTES command to display the Tool
Palettes window.

Book VI
Chapter 4
Organizing Your

Using the Tool Palettes Window
487
To use one of the tools on a tool palette, click the tab or the stack of tabs
under the last tab if all can’t be displayed, and then click the tool or drag
and drop the tool onto the drawing window. Based on the tool you use or
how you use it, you’ll be prompted for additional information. For example,
if you click a hatch tool, you’re prompted for the area to hatch. If you drag
and drop a hatch tool onto a closed boundary, you’re not prompted to pick a
point because you do that when you release the mouse button.
To start the TOOLPALETTES command and display the Tool Palettes
window, use one of the following methods:
✦On the ribbon, click View tab➪Palettes panel➪Tool Palettes.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Tools menu➪Palettes➪Tool
Palettes.
✦On the Standard or Standard Annotation toolbar, click the Tool Palettes
Window button.
✦At the command prompt, type TOOLPALETTES or TP and press Enter.
✦Press Ctrl+3.
Blocks, xrefs, images, tables, and hatches
Tool palettes are designed to allow you to add and organize content on-the-fly
from drawings that you are currently working on or even drawings that have
already been created. Tool palettes allow you to organize blocks, xrefs, images,
tables, hatch patterns, and gradient fills (AutoCAD only). To create a tool out of
these objects, you simply open a drawing and drag and drop the content
directly from the drawing window onto the Tool Palettes window. Dragging and
dropping from a drawing works to create many of these different tools, but you

can also drag and drop content such as drawings and images from Windows
Explorer or linetypes, blocks, hatch patterns, and images from DesignCenter.
Command and flyouts tools
Commands and flyouts can be added to a tool palette so that you can more
easily access the commands that you use regularly. Commands can be cus-
tomized so they perform a specific combination of commands and command
options called a macro. A flyout is somewhat limited in the level of cus-
tomization that can be done with them. Commands can be added to a tool
palette by dragging some types of geometry such as lines, arcs, and dimen-
sions from a drawing onto a tool palette, or by dragging commands from the
Command List pane in the Customize User Interface (CUI) Editor. To add
commands from the CUI Editor, right-click the Tool Palettes window and
choose Customize Commands, and then drag and drop commands from the
Command List pane onto the Tool Palettes window. For more information on
creating tools on tool palettes, choose User’s Guide➪The User Interface➪The
Ribbon, Menus, and Other Tool Locations➪Other Tool Locations➪Tool
Palettes➪Customize Tool Palettes on the Contents tab of the online Help
system.
Modifying tools on a tool palette
You can modify any of the tools that are placed on a tool palette. The proper-
ties you can customize depend on the type of tool. Most tools have a set of
general properties that are common to all tools, such as layer, color, and
linetype. To modify a tool, select the tab in which the tool you want to
modify is on and right-click the tool. From the shortcut menu, choose
Properties to display the Tool Properties dialog box (see Figure 4-4). Change
the properties as necessary and click OK to apply the changes.

Customizing and organizing tool palettes
You can customize the appearance of tools on a tool palette by right-clicking
the tool palette and choosing View Options from the shortcut menu. In the
View Options dialog box, you can control whether tools appear as icons
only, icons with text, or in a list view with icons displayed to the left of the
tools’ description. You can also control the size of the icons for tools.
To make tools as accessible as possible, you can organize tools on tool
palettes that are represented by tabs on the Tools Palettes window and with
tool palette groups. Tool palette groups control which tool palettes are dis-
played. To switch between tool palette groups, right-click the title bar of the
Tool Palettes window and select one of the tool palette groups from the
bottom of the shortcut menu.

T
his minibook walks you through the process of efficiently generating a
hard copy of your drawing. After all, the design process should be the
difficult part and getting your drawing on paper or as a file for sharing
should be straightforward. I wish I could say creating a hard copy of your
drawing is as easy as 1-2-3 — but it does take a little more effort than that.
Printing in AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT is referred to as plotting or publishing.
If you’re wondering why the term printing isn’t used, it’s because plotting
deals with larger sheets of paper and specialized devices called plotters.
Printing, on the other hand, deals with smaller paper sizes for things such
as office documents. Plotting is done one drawing and one layout at a time,
so if you have multiple drawings and layouts to plot, you’ll likely find your-
self using the Publish feature.
Before you plot or publish your drawings, you need to do some setup work.
The type and amount of setup that you need to do before you can generate
a hard copy of your drawing is determined by whether you are plotting a
drawing from the Model tab or a paper space layout. Plotting from the Model
tab is the easiest way, but it doesn’t allow as much flexibility as plotting from
a paper space layout.
Layouts allow you to take advantage of floating viewports to specify different
views of your drawing at different scales while keeping the geometry at full
scale. When you plot a drawing from the Model tab and want to plot objects
at different scales, you need to duplicate and scale the geometry of different
parts of the design. This can result in lost time while you ensure that every-
thing is properly updated. One way to help manage drawing views and sets of
drawings for plotting is to use sheet sets. Sheet sets allow you to electroni-
cally represent a set of drawings in AutoCAD, which allows you to quickly nav-
igate, manage, and distribute a set of drawing files.

Preparing for Output with Page Setups

Preparing for Output with Page Setups
Sending a drawing to a plotter or to an electronic file for output can be chal-
lenging at first because of the number of options that AutoCAD and AutoCAD
LT offer. AutoCAD offers a feature called page setups, which control how the
Model tab or paper space layouts in a drawing are outputted.
The options that are part of a page setup are a subset of the options in the Plot
dialog box, which is covered in Chapter 3 of this minibook. Page setups help to
provide consistency in the way your drawings are plotted. You use Page Setup
Manager (see Figure 1-1) to create new page setups, import page setups from
other drawing files, and assign page setups to layouts within a drawing.
Each layout in a drawing can have its own page setup, but to get the most
flexibility out of using page setups, you should use one page setup for multi-
ple layouts in the same drawing. Page setups are most commonly created in
a drawing template (DWT) file so that they are available when a new drawing
is created based on the drawing template or as page setup override when
publishing a drawing. For more information on drawing templates, see
Chapter 1 of Book VIII.
Options of a page setup
From Page Setup Manager, you can create or modify an existing page setup. To
create or modify a page setup, you use the Page Setup dialog box (see Figure 1-2).
The Page Setup dialog box is where you make the actual option selections that
Figure 1-1:
Page Setup
Manager.

Book VII
Chapter 1
Page Setup
Preparing for Output with Page Setups
495
define the characteristics of a page setup. As I previously mention, a page
setup contains a subset of the options found in the Plot dialog box.
Following is a general overview of the types of options that are part of a
page setup.
✦Printer/Plotter: Specifies the default device that should be used when
plotting or publishing the Model tab or a paper space layout. This allows
you to quickly create different page setups that might be used during
the checking process and for final output.
✦Paper size: Specifies the default paper size to be used, whether it’s a
check plot that you print on a 11 x 17 sheet of paper to validate a design
with a senior member of your design team to ensure that it includes all
the necessary information before being sent out or the final design to be
plotted on an ANSI E 34 x 44 large format paper.
✦Plot area: Specifies the default area of the drawing that you want to
output. This can be the limits of the drawing, a named view, a windowed
area, the current display, the extents of the model when the Model tab is
current, or the layout when a Layout tab is current. The options that you
can select depend on how your drawing was set up and whether you are
outputting from the Model tab or a paper space layout.
✦Plot offset: Specifies the offset value for the origin of the printable area
and whether or not the plot should be centered within the printable area.
✦Plot scale: Specifies how the objects in the plot area should be scaled in
order for them to be displayed properly on the specified paper size. You
can specify an exact scale such as 1/4" = 1'–0" or a custom size that fits
the specified area to be plotted to the specified paper size.
Figure 1-2:
The Page
Setup dialog
box.

Preparing for Output with Page Setups
496
✦Plot style table: Specifies which plot style should be used when out-
putting the Model tab or paper space layout. A plot style can control the
color and lineweights of objects as they are sent to a printer, plotter, or
electronic file.
✦Shaded viewport options: Control how viewports defined on a layout
should be plotted.
✦Plot options: Control how the final plot appears and whether plot styles
and lineweights are used during output.
✦Drawing orientation: Controls the direction in which the drawing
should be output — portrait or landscape. You can also specify that the
output be generated upside down. Based on the type of device you are
using for output, you may need to specify the upside-down option for
the output to come out correctly.
Working with page setups
You can add page setups to a drawing in a couple of ways. You can use Page
Setup Manager and define a new page setup through the Page Setup dialog
box, or you can import them from an existing drawing or drawing template
(DWT) file. When you create a page setup or import it into a drawing, you
can then assign it to a layout. If the page setup in a drawing is later changed,
all the layouts that reference the page setup are updated. To display Page
Setup Manager, you use the PAGESETUP command.
To start the PAGESETUP command, use one of the following methods:
✦On the ribbon, click Output tab➪Plot panel➪Page Setup Manager.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click File menu➪Page Setup Manager.
✦On the Layouts toolbar, click the Page Setup Manager button.
✦At the command prompt, type PAGESETUP and press Enter.
✦When the Model and layout tabs are visible, right-click the current tab at
the bottom of the drawing window and select Page Setup Manager from
the shortcut menu.
Creating a page setup
When you create a page setup, you first determine whether you’re plotting
from the Model tab or a paper space layout. If you create a page setup for
the Model tab, it can be used only with the Model tab. Page setups created
with a paper space layout are available only for paper space layouts.
Alternatively, you can create a page setup based on the current settings in
the Plot dialog box instead of using the Page Setup dialog box.

Book VII

The New Page Setup dialog box appears (see Figure 1-3).
4. In the New Page Setup Name text box, type a name for the page setup.
5. In the Start With list box, select one of the existing page setups or
choose <None> to start with default settings only.
Selecting a page setup from the Start With list box can be helpful if a
page setup already exists that is close to the one you want to create.
6. Click OK.
The New Page Setup dialog box closes and the Page Setup dialog box
appears.
7. Specify the different options you want to use when plotting or pub-
lishing the Model tab or paper space layout.
8. Click OK.
The Page Setup dialog box closes and you return to Page Setup Manager.
The page setup that was created should now be listed in the list box in the
Page Setups section.
9. Click Close.
Page Setup Manager closes and you return to the drawing window.
Figure 1-3:
Naming the

At the bottom of Page Setup Manager is a check box labeled Display When
Creating a New Layout. If the check box is selected, Page Setup Manager is
displayed when a paper space layout is initialized the first time or when a
new paper space layout is created. The option is also available from the
Display tab of the Options dialog box but is labeled Show Page Setup
Manager for New Layouts.
Importing a page setup
Importing a page setup is the fastest and most efficient way of adding a page
setup to a drawing. To import a page setup from an existing drawing file,
follow these steps:
1. Start the PAGESETUP command by using one of the methods in the
previous list.
2. In Page Setup Manager, click Import.
The Select Page Setup from File dialog box appears.
3. Browse to and select a drawing, drawing template (DWT), or DXF file
that contains the page setup you want to import. Click Open.
The Import Page Setups dialog box appears with the available page
setups listed (see Figure 1-4).
4. In the Page Setups list box, select the page setup(s) you want to
import. You can select multiple page setups by holding down the Ctrl
or Shift keys when selecting a page setup. Click OK.

The Import Page Setups dialog box closes and you return to Page Setup
Manager. The selected page setups are displayed in the Page Setups list box.
5. In Page Setup Manager, click Close.
Assigning a page setup to a layout
After you create or import a page setup into your drawing, you can put it to
work. To assign a page setup to the current layout, follow these steps:
1. Click the Quick View Layouts button on the status bar, and choose the
layout for which you want to create a page setup.
2. Start the PAGESETUP command by using one of the methods listed
previously.
Page Setup Manager appears.
3. In the Page Setups list box, select the page setup.
Layouts are listed first in the list box and have an asterisk (*) before and
after their names. Named page setups are listed after the layouts in the
list box. If a layout has been assigned a named page setup, the name of
the page setup is displayed after the layout’s name and placed within
parentheses. An example of the naming convention is *Layout1 (A-size
Check Plot)*.
4. Click Set Current.
The page setup is assigned to the current layout and its name is dis-
played to the right of the Current page setup label just above the Page
Setups list box. You can also double-click a page setup to assign it to the
Model tab or current layout.
5. Click Close.
Editing a page setup
When editing a page setup, you use the Page Setup dialog box and any lay-
outs that reference the page setup are automatically updated with the
changes made. The following steps outline how to modify a page setup:
1. Click the Quick View Layouts button on the status bar, and choose the
layout for which you want to create a page setup.

Organizing a Drawing with Layouts
Layouts are used to help control how a drawing is plotted or published. In
AutoCAD R14 and earlier, the Model tab and paper space layouts were
simply referred to as Model Space and Paper Space. This changed with the
introduction of layouts with AutoCAD 2000. AutoCAD R14 and earlier
releases supported a single Model Space (or Model tab) and a single Paper
Space (or paper space layout tab). AutoCAD 2000 made it possible to have
one Model tab and multiple paper space layouts.
AutoCAD 2009 and AutoCAD LT 2009 allow you to save all the way back to
the AutoCAD R14 file format, which does not support multiple paper space
layout tabs. To exchange a drawing that contains multiple layout tabs with a
user on AutoCAD R14, you need to set each layout current, one at a time,
and save the drawing out once for each layout. You need to do this only if
you use more than one paper space layout in your drawing and if the
receiver of the drawing files needs to have access to each of the layout tabs.
If you do find that you need to share your drawings with a user who is on
AutoCAD R14 and needs access to the information on each layout tab, you
can use the new EXPORTLAYOUT command (on the ribbon, click Output
tab➪Send panel➪Export Layout to Model or right-click a layout tab at the
bottom of the drawing window and choose Export Layout to Model. Some
other CAD programs that your clients and vendors use might understand
only one paper space layout, so you might need to export a layout to a new
drawing in these conditions as well.
Think of a layout as a piece of paper and a way to visually organize how
parts of your drawing will appear on the sheet of paper. Generally, you
should do all your designing and drawing on the Model tab, but there are
some exceptions to this rule. At times, you may need to add annotation and
dimensions related to part of your drawing that is being displayed through a
floating viewport, but otherwise you’ll be working mainly on the Model tab.
You use floating viewports to display parts of the drawing from the Model tab
at a specific scale onto a paper space layout. I cover floating viewports later
in this chapter in the “Looking at a Model through Viewports” section. Most
commonly, you’ll find a title block that has been inserted or referenced on a
layout, in addition to one or more floating viewports.

Working with layouts
Layouts, unlike page setups, are not managed through a dialog box. Layouts
are managed by clicking the tabs that appear along the bottom of the drawing
window or the Quick View Layouts button on the status bar. Everything that
you might need for creating or modifying a layout is at the tip of your cursor.
The LAYOUT command is used to create and manage paper space layouts.
To start the LAYOUT command, use one of the following methods:
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Insert menu➪Layout and then
one of the available options.
✦On the Layouts toolbar, click the New Layout or Layout from Template
button.
✦At the command prompt, type LAYOUT and press Enter.
✦On the status bar, click Quick View Layouts➪Quick View Layouts
panel➪New Layout.
✦When the Model and paper space layout tabs are visible, right-click a
paper space layout tab at the bottom of the drawing window and select
one of the different options above the top separator bar of the menu.
Creating a layout by using the Create Layout Wizard
Layouts typically contain title blocks, floating viewports, annotation, and utilize
references to page setups. To make the process of creating and setting up a
layout as efficient as possible, AutoCAD comes with the Create Layout Wizard
(see Figure 1-5), which you launch with the LAYOUTWIZARD command.
Figure 1-5:
The Create
Layout
Wizard gets
you on the
fast track to
creating a
layout.

Organizing a Drawing with Layouts
502
To use the Create Layout Wizard, follow these steps:
1. At the command prompt, type layoutwizard and press Enter (or on the
menu browser or menu bar, choose Insert menu➪Layout➪Create
Layout Wizard).
The Create Layout Wizard appears.
2. On the Begin page, enter a name in the Enter a Name for the New
Layout You Are Creating text box. Click Next.
The name of the layout can be a maximum of 255 characters, which is a
very long layout name. The layout tab displays roughly 31 characters (at
the most).
3. On the Printer page, select one of the available printers or plotters.
Click Next.
The printer you specify is used as the default output device for the
layout. I cover adding plotters in Chapter 3 of this minibook.
4. On the Paper Size page, select one of the available paper sizes from
the drop-down list and the drawing units. Click Next.
The paper size is assigned to the layout and used during output. The
paper sizes that you can select from are determined by the printer or
plotter that you selected in Step 3. Drawing units are typically in inches
or millimeters, but if you choose a printer that generates an image file,
you also have the option of pixels. The measurement size of the paper is
displayed in the Paper Size in Units section.
5. On the Orientation page, select either Portrait or Landscape. Click Next.
The orientation controls which way the paper is turned in the drawing
window and for output.
6. On the Title Block page, select one of the available drawing files to
use as the title block on the layout or select None. If you select a title
block, you need to specify how the title block is placed on the layout:
block or xref. Click Next.
The title blocks that you can choose from are the ones that come with
AutoCAD by default. The title blocks that you can select from are deter-
mined by the path in which AutoCAD looks for drawing templates. To
change the path where AutoCAD looks, choose Tools menu➪Options on
the menu bar or menu browser. Then in the Options dialog box, click the
Files tab and expand Template Settings➪Drawing Template File Location.
Select the path below Drawing Template File Location and click Browse.
In the Browse for Folder dialog box, specify the new path and click OK.

7. On the Define Viewports page, select one of the four viewport setups
and the scale of the objects in the viewports created. You can also set
the spacing between each viewport and the number of viewports cre-
ated when the Array option is used under Viewport Setup. Click Next.
The available options are usually not exactly what you want, but they do
allow for a good starting point. After the viewports are created, you can
resize and adjust them with grips and the Properties palette later.
8. On the Pick Location page, click Select Location to specify the area
where you want the viewports to be created on the layout. Click Next.
You return to the drawing window to define the location for the viewports.
After you specify two points, you return to the Create Layout Wizard.
9. On the Finish page, click Finish.
The Create Layout Wizard closes, and the new layout is created based
on the options that you specified with the wizard.
Importing a layout
The Create Layout Wizard is nice, but there are some things you will most
likely need to do after you use the wizard, such as assign a page setup and
define the layouts so they display the desired parts of the drawing from the
Model tab. As with page setups, AutoCAD allows you to import layouts from
an existing drawing. Importing a layout allows you to spend less time setting
up your drawing and more time drafting. To import a layout from another
drawing, you use the Template option of the LAYOUT command, or right-
click a paper space layout tab or the Quick View Layouts button on the
status bar and choose From Template.
To import a layout into a drawing, follow these steps:
1. On the menu browser, click Insert menu➪Layout➪Layout from
Template.
The Select Template from File dialog box is displayed. This dialog box
allows you to browse to a drawing, drawing template (DWT), or DXF file
that contains the layout you want to import.
2. Select the drawing, drawing template (DWT), or DXF file that contains
the layout you want to import. Click Open.
The Insert Layout(s) dialog box is displayed and lists the available paper
space layouts that can be imported (see Figure 1-6).
3. Select a layout or multiple layouts from the list box. Click OK.
The layouts are imported to the drawing and positioned to the right of
the last layout tab.

Organizing a Drawing with Layouts
504
Page setups are not automatically imported when importing a layout. If you
want to keep the page setup with the layout, you must first import the page
setup that the layout references and then import the layout.
Modifying a layout
You can modify layout tabs in a variety of ways. You can remove them from a
drawing or change their order. You can use the LAYOUT command for many
of these tasks, but you can also use the shortcut menu of a layout tab, the
Quick View Layouts button on the status bar, or a layout preview on Quick
View Layouts. Most of the following options are available for modifying a
layout, regardless of the method you use:
✦Delete: Allows you to remove the selected layout from the drawing.
(This option is not accessible when you right-click the Quick View
Layouts button on the status bar.)
✦Rename: Allows you to rename a layout by using the in-place editor.
(This option is not accessible when you right-click the Quick View
Layouts button on the status bar.)
✦Move or Copy: Displays the Move and Copy dialog box so you can con-
trol the order in which layouts are displayed and quickly create a copy
of an existing layout in the drawing.
✦Select All Layouts: Allows you to select all the layouts in the drawing
except for the Model tab.
Navigating layouts
A drawing contains at least one paper space layout at all times and one
Model tab, but may contain many more paper space layouts than that. When
you get past about four or five layouts, navigating layouts becomes a little
more difficult because tabs start becoming hidden from view. AutoCAD
offers a couple of ways to navigate through the tabs that represent the paper
space layouts in the drawing. The most common way to navigate the layout
tabs is to click the tab you want to activate or use the set of four controls
Figure 1-6:
Importing an
existing
layout from

located at the bottom of the drawing window (see Figure 1-7) when there are
more tabs than there is space for all the paper space layout tabs.
The far left control jumps to the first layout tab, and the far right control
jumps to the last layout tab. The two controls located in the middle allow
you to step one layout tab at a time to the next or previous tab. You can also
use the keyboard combinations Ctrl+Page Up and Ctrl+Page Down to step to
the next or previous layout tab one at a time.
You can turn off the display of the layout tabs and still access different lay-
outs efficiently. If you right-click a layout tab, you can hide the Model tab
and paper space layout tabs by choosing Hide Layout and Model tabs from
the shortcut menu. When the layout tabs are hidden, two new controls are
displayed in the status bar area to allow you to access the Model tab and the
previous paper space layout in the drawing.
To switch between paper space layouts when the layout tabs along the
bottom of the drawing window are hidden, you can click the Quick View
Layouts button on the status bar and then the layout you want to set cur-
rent. You can also use Quick View Layouts when the tabs are displayed.
Appearance of layouts
The appearance of layouts and the layout tab can be controlled through the
Display tab of the Options dialog box. To access the Options dialog box, on
the menu bar or menu browser click Tools menu➪Options. The Layout
Element section controls many of the visual cues that are present when a
layout tab is current (see Figure 1-8). These include the printable area, the
overall paper size, and a shadow to give the paper a 3D look.
The background color can be modified as well so you can tell when you’re
on a layout tab instead of the Model tab, or you can make the background for
the Model tab and the layout tabs appear the same. The different color options
are available through the Colors button in the Window Elements section of the
Display tab in the Options dialog box. You can also control the color of the UCS
Icon when a layout tab is active through the UCS Icon dialog box. To display 
the UCS Icon dialog box, on the menu bar or menu browser click View menu➪
Display➪UCS Icon➪Properties.

Looking at a Model through Viewports

Looking at a Model through Viewports
Layouts by themselves do not provide all the necessary components for get-
ting a drawing ready for output. When you use the Create Layout Wizard,
you are prompted to define the viewports and provide a scale for them, so
you know viewports are important on a layout. Viewports allow you to see
part or all the objects that are on the Model tab and to have those objects
displayed at a specific scale.
AutoCAD offers two types of viewports: model (or tiled) and floating. Model
(or tiled) viewports are created only on the Model tab and provide a way to
navigate easily between different areas of the drawing; they are not used to
output areas of the drawing. Floating viewports are created only on a paper
space layout and are used to organize a drawing for output. The following
sections cover how to create and work with floating viewports on a layout.
Defining a viewport’s shape
AutoCAD supports two types of floating viewports: rectangular and irregular
(polygonal and closed objects, such as a circle or spline). Rectangular view-
ports are the more common of the two, but being able to create a viewport
from a circle or closed polyline can allow you to conserve space on a layout
or jazz one up. You use the VPORTS command to create both rectangular
and irregular viewports.

AutoCAD LT 2009 now supports the ability to create irregular-shaped floating
viewports.
To start the VPORTS command, use one of the following methods:
✦On the ribbon, click View tab➪Viewports panel➪New.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click View➪Viewports➪Named
Viewports.
✦On the Viewports or Layouts toolbar, click the Display Viewports Dialog
button.
✦At the command prompt, type VPORTS and press Enter.
Creating a rectangular viewport
Rectangular viewports are the most common and easiest types of viewports to
create. The Viewports dialog box, shown in Figure 1-9, offers some standard
configurations for quickly laying out rectangular viewports. You can specify
up to four viewports, each with a different visual style and view. The Viewports
dialog box offers some default views for 3D drawings as well, such as Top,
Left, and Southwest isometric.
Figure 1-9:
The
Viewports
dialog box.

Looking at a Model through Viewports
508
To add viewports to a layout based on a standard configuration, follow these
steps:
1. Select the paper space layout on which you want to create floating
viewports.
Make sure that no viewports already exist on the layout by erasing any
that are there, or be sure to have enough area to add additional ones.
2. Start the VPORTS command by using one of the methods described
previously.
3. In the Viewports dialog box, make sure that the New Viewports tab is
displayed. In the Standard Viewports list box, select the configuration
you want to use.
The Preview area updates to reflect the viewport configuration you
selected.
4. In the Viewport Spacing text box, enter the amount of space you want
between the viewports that are created. This affects only the view-
ports you are currently creating.
The size of the spacing should be small because you need to specify a
scale of 1 in the Plot dialog box when plotting a paper space layout.
5. If your drawing is of a 3D model, select 3D in the Setup drop-down
list; otherwise, leave it as the default 2D value.
If you specify 3D, you have some additional views to choose from in the
Change View To drop-down list. Otherwise, there is no other difference
between specifying 2D or 3D.
6. In the Preview area, click the different sections of the preview that
represent the viewports that will be created.
When you make selections in the different sections of the Preview,
you’re setting that representation of a viewport current to adjust its
view and visual style.
7. With the representation of the viewport set current, select a named
view in the Change View To drop-down list.
The selected named view is displayed in the Preview section for the
selected viewport.
8. In the Visual Style drop-down list, select a visual style to assign it to
the selected viewport.
The selected visual style is displayed in the Preview section for the
selected viewport.
9. Repeat Steps 6 through 8 for each of the viewports in the Preview 
section.
10. Click OK.

The Viewports dialog box closes, and you return to the drawing window.
The following prompt is displayed at the command line:
Specify first corner or [Fit] <Fit>:
11. In the drawing window, specify the first point for the viewports to be
created in the printable area on the current layout.
You are specifying a rectangular area where the viewports will be cre-
ated. The next prompt is displayed at the command line:
Specify opposite corner:
12. Specify the opposite corner to finish defining the area where you
want the viewports to be created.
The viewports are created in the defined area based on the options
specified in the Viewports dialog box. You should notice that the objects
on the Model tab are displayed in each of the viewports.
Creating an irregular viewport
You create irregular viewports by using the command line version of the
VPORTS command, which is –VPORTS (a hyphen in front of the command).
The –VPORTS command has some additional options that the dialog box ver-
sion of the command doesn’t have for working with viewports and creating
irregular viewports.
The two options that the –VPORTS command offers for creating irregular
viewports are Polygonal and Object. The –VPORTS command displays the
following prompt at the command line when it is first started:
Specify corner of viewport or
[ON/OFF/Fit/Shadeplot/Lock/Object/Polygonal/Restore/LAyer/2/3
/4] <Fit>:
With the –VPORTS command, you can also create a single rectangular-
shaped viewport by specifying two points. To create a single rectangular
viewport, type –VPORT at the command prompt, choose View
menu➪Viewports➪1 Viewport on the menu bar or menu browser, or choose
Single Viewport on the Viewports toolbar. Then specify a base point and
then the opposite corner for the rectangular viewport.
To add an irregular viewport to a layout by using the Polygonal option,
follow these steps:
1. Select the paper space layout on which you want to create an irregular-
shaped floating viewport.

Looking at a Model through Viewports
510
2. On the ribbon, click View tab➪Viewports panel➪Polygonal.
The –VPORTS command starts and displays the following prompt at the
command line:
Specify start point:
3. In the drawing window, specify the first point of the polygonal object
that will be used to define the viewport.
After specifying the first point of the polygonal object, the following
prompt appears at the command line:
Specify next point or [Arc/Length/Undo]:
4. Specify the next point or select one of the available options. This
example assumes that you selected the next point.
After selecting the next point of the polygonal object, the previous
prompt is displayed again, except with a Close option added:
Specify next point or [Arc/Close/Length/Undo]:
5. Continue specifying points as necessary to define the polygonal
object.
6. When you have finished specifying points, right-click and select Close,
or type C at the command prompt and press Enter.
The command ends and the objects on the Model tab are displayed in
the viewport.
Irregular viewports can be created in a drawing based on closed objects. The
objects that can be used to create an irregular viewport are circles, closed
polylines, ellipses, closed splines, and regions. To create an irregular view-
port, draw the closed object you want to use as the shape of the viewport on
a paper space layout; then click View menu➪Viewports➪Object on the menu
browser or menu bar (or on the ribbon, click View tab➪Viewports➪Object).
After you start the –VPORTS command, select the closed object to convert
to a viewport. The command ends and the objects from the Model tab are
displayed in the viewport.
Controlling scale
Paper space layouts are plotted at a scale of 1:1, so to get the objects in the
viewports to be plotted and displayed correctly, you specify a scale for each
viewport. You do this by using the scale list on the Viewports toolbar, the
Standard Scale property in the Properties palette, or the Viewport Scale list
on the status bar. The following procedure uses the Properties palette to
change the scale for a floating viewport.
1. On a paper space layout, select the viewport whose scale you want to
change.

Book VII
Chapter 1
Page Setup
Looking at a Model through Viewports
511
The grips for the selected viewport appear.
2. With the viewport selected, right-click and select Properties from the
shortcut menu.
The Properties palette appears.
3. On the Properties palette, select the desired scale for the viewport in
the drop-down list for the Standard Scale property.
The viewport is updated to display the objects on the Model tab at the
specified scale. You can also specify a custom scale by typing the scale
value in the Custom Scale text box on the Properties palette. In addition
to controlling the scale of objects in the viewport, if you have annotation
objects such as blocks, dimensions, or text, you also need to set the
annotation scale for the viewport. You set the annotation scale for a
viewport by using the Annotation Scale property on the Properties
palette, or you can synchronize the annotation scale of a viewport so it’s
the same as the scale of the viewport by clicking Annotation
Synchronize to the right of the Viewport Scale list on the status bar.
You can use the SCALELISTEDIT command to display the Edit Scale List
dialog box to control which scales are available for use in one of the scale
lists for AutoCAD. The list of scales in the Edit Scale List dialog box controls
which scales are available in the scale list on the Viewports toolbar, the Plot
and Page Setup dialog boxes, and the Viewport Scale list on the status bar
among other places.
Controlling the display within a viewport
You can move in and out of viewports on a paper space layout by double-clicking
inside or outside a viewport. This places you in model space so you can inter-
act with the objects on the Model tab. By entering the viewport this way, you
can control which objects on the Model tab are displayed through the view-
port by panning. After you have the objects positioned correctly, you can then
lock the viewport so the scale and view of the objects in the viewport are not
accidentally changed. To lock the display of a viewport, select the viewport
and click the Lock/Unlock Viewport button on the status bar until the image of
a padlock appears closed/locked, or right-click the selected viewport and
choose Display Locked➪Yes (choose No to unlock the viewport).
At times you may want to edit objects through a viewport but want to avoid
accidentally changing the scale and view of the objects in the viewport. In this
case, there’s a way to open the viewport so that it fills the entire drawing area.
If you double-click on the viewport’s border, the viewport is maximized in the
drawing window. This allows you to pan and zoom in the viewport even if its
display has been locked to prevent any accidental changes to its scale. Figure
1-10 shows a viewport that has been maximized. You can tell when a viewport
is maximized by the appearance of a red border made up of slash marks that
goes around the inside of the drawing window. Double-clicking outside the

Looking at a Model through Viewports
512
red border of a maximized viewport restores the viewport to its original size
and scale. You can also click the Maximize and Minimize Viewport controls
in the status bar.
At times, you’ll want to hide objects on certain layers that might contain
objects that you don’t want displayed in a particular viewport. In this case,
you can specify whether objects are frozen only in the viewport rather than
globally across the entire drawing. To freeze layers for a specific viewport,
double-click to enter the viewport in which you want to freeze a layer. You’ll
be able to tell that the focus has been shifted to the viewport when its
border is displayed as bold and crosshairs are present within the viewport.
On the Layers toolbar, click the Freeze or Thaw in Current Viewport icon
(see Figure 1-11) next to the layer that you want to freeze for the viewport.
On the ribbon, click Home tab➪Layers panel➪Layers drop-down list. You
can also use the Layer Properties Manager palette. To exit the viewport,
simply double-click outside the viewport’s border.
Starting in AutoCAD 2008, you could override the properties for a layer in a
viewport by using Layer Properties Manager. When in a viewport, you can
override the color, linetype, lineweight, and plot style of the layers for that
particular viewport. To do so, display the Layers Properties Manager palette
and scroll to the right. The columns starting with VP are specific to the cur-
rent viewport. To undo the layer overrides, select the viewport to remove all
the layer overrides for the viewport and choose Remove Viewport Overrides
for All Layers from the shortcut menu.

Another way to control the display of objects in a viewport is by completely
turning off the viewport. The viewport remains in the drawing, but any objects
that would normally be displayed through the viewport are not displayed.
To control the display of the objects through a viewport, select the viewport,
right-click, and choose Display Viewport Objects➪No. (Choose Yes to display
the objects in a viewport.)
In addition to controlling the layer properties and display of the actual
objects in a viewport, you can designate how 3D objects are displayed.
When a viewport is active, you can designate its visual style by setting a
visual style current through Visual Styles Manager; by using the ribbon by
clicking Visualize tab➪Visualize Styles panel➪Visual Styles drop-down list;
or by selecting a viewport, right-clicking, and choosing a visual style or
render preset in the Shade Plot submenu. For more on visual styles and ren-
dering, see Chapter 6 of Book V.
Modifying a viewport
You can modify a viewport by using the Properties palette, the MOVE and
COPY commands, grips, and many other standard modify commands. Using
grip editing is by far one of the most efficient ways to adjust the size, shape,
and location of a viewport. Adjusting a viewport by using grips has no effect
on the scale or the viewpoint within the viewport. It will, however, affect
which objects are displayed through the viewport. The VPCLIP command
can also be used to shape the viewport by re-creating its overall shape; the
viewpoint and scale of the viewport are not affected.
To start the VPCLIP command, use one of the following methods:
✦On the ribbon, click View tab➪Viewports panel➪Viewport Clip.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Modify menu➪Clip➪Viewport.
Figure 1-11:
Freezing a

✦On the Viewports toolbar, click the Clip Existing Viewport button.
✦At the command prompt, type VPCLIP and press Enter.
✦Select a floating viewport, right-click, and choose Viewport Clip from the
shortcut menu.
The following steps explain how to clip a floating viewport based on a polyg-
onal boundary:
1. Start the VPCLIP command by using one of the methods in the preced-
ing list.
The following prompt appears at the command line:
Select viewport to clip:
2. At the prompt, select the floating viewport that you want to clip.
The following prompt appears at the command line:
Select clipping object or [Polygonal] <Polygonal>:
3. Press Enter to accept the default option of clipping a floating viewport
based on a polygonal boundary.
The following prompt appears at the command line:
Specify start point:
4. Continue specifying points for the new clipping boundary. When
you’re finished, type c and press Enter,
The clipping boundary is closed and the command ends.
You can use the VPCLIP command to create an irregular-shaped viewport by
selecting the viewport and then the closed object you want to use as the
new clipping boundary.
When you use the COPYCLIP command to copy viewports between layouts,
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT now automatically turn the layout on when you
paste a copied viewport. You can still control the display of objects in a
viewport on a layout by selecting a viewport, right-clicking, and then choos-
ing Display Viewport Objects➪Yes.
If you freeze or turn off the layer on which the viewport is drawn, you can
hide the border of the viewport, making only the objects in the viewport visi-
ble when you plot or publish the drawing.

Chapter 2: Sheet Sets 
without Regret
In This Chapter
 Understanding sheet sets
 Creating your first sheet set
 Managing your drawings with a sheet set
 Publishing, eTransmitting, and archiving your sheet set
S
heet sets were introduced in AutoCAD 2005 and are still a relatively new
concept in AutoCAD. They’re the digital equivalent of an old drafting
concept called a drawing set. A drawing set contains numerous drawings,
and often includes references to details, sections, and elevations within the
drawing set, along with a drawing or two that contain an index of all draw-
ings in the set.
AutoCAD LT does not support sheet sets.
Overview of a Sheet Set
Sheet sets take advantage of the existing drawings you have been creating
over the years. A sheet set contains sheets, which are references to paper
space layouts — sorry, you can’t use the Model tab as a sheet. If you use the
Model tab for plotting and publishing today, you need to switch to the use of
paper space layouts to take advantage of sheet sets. A sheet set and all the
references to its sheets are stored in a file with the DST extension and are
accessed through Sheet Set Manager (see Figure 2-1). By using references to
the drawing files, you can use your own directory structures while taking
advantage of the benefits of sheet sets. Some of these benefits are
✦Fast file access: Because a sheet set knows right where a file is located,
drawings can be accessed in a short amount of time without the need to
browse and open a file.
✦Consistent drawing creation: Sheet sets can be set up to specify the
directory structure and location in which new sheets should be created
when they are added to the sheet set. You can also specify which drawing
template (DWT) file should be used to create new sheets and drawings.

Overview of a Sheet Set
516
✦Quick updates: Sheet sets allow you to create references to views on
sheets (paper space layouts) and manage the names and numbers of
views. This allows you to quickly renumber a view and not have to worry
about exactly where that view is placed. The next time the drawing is
opened, the numbering is updated. This also works very well for project
information in a title block that is on a paper space layout.
✦Publish drawings: Creating a drawing set can be time consuming when
it’s time to package things and get them ready to send to the client.
Sheet sets allow you to organize drawings and then quickly publish the
entire set of drawings or selected drawings.
✦Package drawings: During a normal project cycle, you’ll need to send
drawings electronically to others and create revisions of drawings in a
drawing set. With sheet sets, you can eTransmit or archive an entire set
of drawings.
✦Create an index table of sheets: One of the things that can take time to
generate, but is fairly automated with sheet sets, is the creation of an
index of all the sheets in a sheet set. Because all the sheets are named
and numbered in the sheet set, you can create an index with just a few
mouse clicks.

Sheet Set Manager
Sheet Set Manager is the tool in AutoCAD that you’ll be using to work with sheet
sets. It allows you to do everything you need to do to work efficiently with a
sheet set. From inside Sheet Set Manager, you can open sheets (drawings),
add and remove sheets, add and remove subsets, change the order of sub-
sets and sheets, work with model views, and much more. Sheet Set Manager
is organized into three areas, each represented by a tab: Sheet List, Sheet
Views and Model Views.
The Sheet List tab is where you access sheets and subsets in the sheet set.
You use the Sheet Views tab to manage any of the named views that have
been placed on the sheets that are part of the sheet set from the Model Views
tab. The Model Views tab lists the drawings and any of the named views that
are stored in them; these drawings are only used for placing views on sheets
in the current sheet set. You use the SHEETSET command to display Sheet Set
Manager.
To start the SHEETSET command, do one of the following:
✦On the ribbon, click View tab➪Palettes panel➪Sheet Set Manager.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Tools menu➪Palettes➪Sheet
Set Manager.
✦On the Standard or Standard Annotation toolbar, click the Sheet Set
Manager button.
✦Press Ctrl+4.
✦At the command prompt type SHEETSET or SSM and press Enter.
Creating a Sheet Set
Sheet sets are commonly created by using the Create Sheet Set Wizard. The
Create Sheet Set Wizard allows you to create a new sheet set by using an
existing sheet set as a template or by creating one from scratch. You typi-
cally create a sheet set from scratch the first time you create one so you can
define the common properties that your projects will have, and then use
that sheet set as a template for future sheet sets that you create. After you
create a sheet set, you can import references to paper space layouts from
your existing drawing files.
After you add some drawing layouts to a sheet set, you typically organize
those layouts in the sheet set by using subsets. Subsets enable you to organ-
ize sheets into folders that can be used to represent actual folder locations
on a drive or not. After the subsets have been created, you can designate a
drawing template (DWT) file to use for any new sheets that are created in

Creating a Sheet Set
518
that subset or move existing sheets from other subsets or the root of the
sheet set to better organize the sheets with Sheet Set Manager. A drawing
template (DWT) file that is used with sheet sets commonly has a title block
that contains attributes that are adjusted to take advantage of fields specific
to properties of a sheet or sheet set.
The last part of setting up a sheet set involves working with model (named)
views. Sheet sets allow you to place named views on a sheet. When you
place a named view on a sheet, AutoCAD creates an external reference (xref)
to the drawing that contains the named view and a new viewport on the
layout that the view is being placed on. The viewport contains the objects in
the named view.
I cover creating named views in Chapter 3 of Book II. To access named views
from other drawings, they must first be in a location that has been desig-
nated through Sheet Set Manager as a resource location for the sheet set. To
finish the setup for adding views to a sheet, you need to specify which call-
outs and label blocks will be used when views are placed on a sheet. To get
started, you don’t need to use all the features that sheet sets offer at once.
Often people start using sheet sets as a way to organize and access drawings
to simplify file navigation and plotting.
Starting from scratch
The Create Sheet Set Wizard option to create a new sheet set by using exist-
ing drawings from scratch requires the most input. This option provides for
a good understanding of what is involved with the initial setup of a sheet set.
After you create a sheet set according to your company standards, you can
use the other option of creating a sheet set from an existing one. You use the
NEWSHEETSET command to start the Create Sheet Set Wizard.
To start the NEWSHEETSET command, do one of the following:
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click File menu➪New Sheet Set.
✦At the command prompt, type NEWSHEETSET and press Enter.
✦In Sheet Set Manager, click the down arrow on the drop-down list along
the top and select New Sheet Set.
To create a new sheet set, follow these steps:
1. Start the NEWSHEETSET command by using one of the methods in the
preceding list.
The Create Sheet Set Wizard appears. To create a sheet set from Sheet
Set Manager you must have at least one drawing open.

2. Select the Existing Drawings option and click Next.
The Existing Drawings option allows you to create a sheet set from scratch.
If you already have a sheet set created and want to create a new sheet set
based on the existing one, select the An Example Sheet Set option.
3. In the Name of New Sheet Set text box (see Figure 2-2), type a name
for the sheet set.
The name entered is used as the name for the DST file when the wizard
is finished. This is also the name of the top-level node displayed in Sheet
Set Manager when the sheet set is opened.
4. In the Description (optional) text box, type a description for the sheet set.
The description is displayed in Sheet Set Manager and can be referenced
in a field and placed as part of the index sheet.
5. Specify where to create the new sheet set.
To do so, enter a path in the Store Sheet Set Data File (.dst) Here text
box or click the ellipsis (...) button to browse to a folder. If you click the
ellipsis button, the Browse for Sheet Set Folder dialog box is displayed.
Browse to a location in the dialog box and select the folder that you
want to use. Click Open to use the selected folder. By default, the folder
used to store sheet sets is in AutoCAD Sheet Sets under Documents or
My Documents, depending on the operating system you are running.
The specified location is where the DST file will be created when the
Create Sheet Set Wizard is finished. It’s a good idea to place sheet sets
on a network drive so that others in the office can access them.
6. Click Sheet Set Properties to specify standard and custom properties
for the sheet set.

Starting from an existing sheet set
You can create a sheet set by using an existing sheet set as a template. The
following steps explain how:
1. Start the NEWSHEETSET command by using one of the previously
described methods.
The Create Sheet Set Wizard appears.
2. Select the An Example Sheet Set option and click Next.
The An Example Sheet Set option allows you to select an existing sheet
set to use as a template.
3. Select the Select a Sheet Set to Use as an Example option and then
select one of the available sheet sets from the list, or select Browse to
Another Sheet Set to Use as an Example and then click the ellipsis (...)
button to specify which DST file you want to start with. Click Next.
If you choose the Select a Sheet Set to Use as an Example option, the
DST files that are listed are located in the Template directory. The loca-
tion of the DST files can be changed through the Files tab of the Options
dialog box by choosing Template Settings➪Sheet Set Template File
Location.
4. Specify the new sheet set’s name, description, and save to location,
and change its properties with the Sheet Set Properties dialog box.
Any subsets are copied over, but any references to layouts that make
up the sheets in the sheet set template are not carried over to the new
sheet set. Click Next.
You get everything that was in the selected sheet set file, minus any
sheets. If you want to keep the sheets in the new sheet set, you must
make a copy of the original sheet set file by using Windows Explorer.
5. On the Confirm page, review the Sheet Set Preview section. Click
Back to make any necessary changes in the wizard. Click Finish when
everything looks good.
The Create Sheet Set wizard closes and the new sheet set (DST) file is
created with the specified name and in the designated folder. Sheet Set
Manager is displayed if it was hidden and the DST file opens.
Managing Drawings with a Sheet Set
You can work with drawings through a sheet set in a number of ways, such
as navigating to and opening existing drawing files, creating new sheets
(drawings), working with title block information, and placing model views.
Some companies have taken the approach of first implementing sheet sets as
a way to open and publish drawings much faster, and others have changed

Book VII
Chapter 2
Sheet Sets 
without Regret

523
their entire drafting process to include the use of sheet sets to manage the
views and title block information as well as the benefits of opening and pub-
lishing drawings much faster.
Opening a sheet set
After closing and restarting AutoCAD, the OPENSHEETSET command allows
you to open an existing sheet set (DST) file. Just like the NEWSHEETSET
command, the OPENSHEETSET command displays Sheet Set Manager if it’s
not currently displayed after you select an existing sheet set.
To start the OPENSHEETSET command, do one of the following:
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click File menu➪Open Sheet Set.
✦At the command prompt, type OPENSHEETSET and press Enter.
✦In Sheet Set Manager, click the down arrow on the drop-down list along
the top and select Open Sheet Set.
You can open one of the ten most recently used sheet set (DST) files from
the drop-down list in Sheet Set Manager.
To open a sheet set file, follow these steps:
1. Start the OPENSHEETSET command by using one of the methods in
the preceding list.
The Open Sheet Set dialog box appears. You can use this dialog box to
browse and select an existing sheet set (DST) file.
2. In the Open Sheet Set dialog box, select the sheet set (DST) file you
want to open. Click Open.
The Open Sheet Set dialog box closes and the selected sheet set (DST)
file is loaded into Sheet Set Manager. If Sheet Set Manager is not currently
displayed, it is displayed after the Open Sheet Set dialog box is closed.
Importing existing drawings as sheets
If you’ve been using AutoCAD at your company for many years, you most
likely have created hundreds, if not thousands, of drawings. This is one of
the concerns that Autodesk kept in mind when implementing sheet sets in
AutoCAD 2005. Sheet sets are designed to work well with your existing draw-
ing files without having to worry about migrating your files just so they can
be used with sheet sets. You can import paper space layouts from drawings
when you create a sheet set based on existing drawings by using the Create
Sheet Set Wizard. Most of the time, however, you won’t know which draw-
ings need to be imported right away, or which drawings might come from a
vendor and need to be added to the sheet set later.

Managing Drawings with a Sheet Set
524
Sheet Set Manager allows you to import paper space layouts from a drawing
into a sheet set file after it has been created. This allows for a lot of flexibility
in the workflow of a project. Paper space layouts can be imported to the
main root of a sheet set or a subset; it all just depends on how the sheet set
is laid out. The following steps explain how to import paper space layouts as
sheets and assumes you already have a sheet set open in Sheet Set Manager.
To open an existing sheet set, refer to the “Opening a sheet set” section.
1. In Sheet Set Manager’s Sheet List tab, right-click the top-level node
that displays the sheet set’s name.
You can also right-click a subset if you want to add layouts to it. I cover
subsets in the next section.
2. On the shortcut menu, click Import Layout as Sheet.
The Import Layouts as Sheets dialog box appears (see Figure 2-6). The
dialog box allows you to browse for drawings that contain paper space
layouts that you want to import as sheets.
3. Click Browse for Drawings.
The Select Drawing dialog box appears, allowing you to browse for draw-
ing files. You can select more than one drawing by holding down the Ctrl
or Shift keys while selecting files.
4. Click Open.
The Select Drawing dialog box closes, and you return to the Import
Layout as Sheets dialog box. The selected files are scanned for paper
space layouts. During the scanning, the layouts are added to the grid in
the center of the dialog box and evaluated as to whether they are
already referenced by a sheet set.
Figure 2-6:

5. Deselect the layouts you do not want to import as sheets into the 
sheet set.
By default, if a layout is already associated with a sheet set, the layout is
deselected, and all other layouts are selected. Only paper space layouts
can be imported.
6. Deselect or select the Prefix Sheet Titles with File Name option.
This option controls whether the file name that a layout comes from is
added to the sheet’s title. This can be helpful if you do not normally give
your layout tabs a specific name in each drawing. The sheet’s title can
be changed later.
7. Click Import Checked.
The dialog box closes and the checked layouts are added to the sheet
set as sheets.
Organizing with subsets
Subsets are used to organize sheets in a sheet set. A subset may represent a
folder on a local or network drive, but it doesn’t have to. Subsets can be cre-
ated at the root level of a sheet set or within another subset. Typically, a subset
is used to group similar drawings (such as by floor or discipline) so that you
can quickly find the sheets you’re looking for. The following steps explain how
to create a subset. The steps assume that you have a sheet set open in Sheet
Set Manager. To open a sheet set, refer to the “Opening a sheet set” section.
1. In Sheet Set Manager’s Sheet List tab, right-click the top-level node
that displays the sheet set’s name or a subset.
2. On the shortcut menu, click New Subset.
The Subset Properties dialog box appears (see Figure 2-7). You can use
this dialog box to specify the name of the subset, whether the folder is
created relative to its parent, where new sheets that are added to the
subset are created, and which drawing template (DWT) file to use to
create new sheets under the subset.
Figure 2-7:
Specifying
properties
for a subset.

Managing Drawings with a Sheet Set
526
3. In the Subset Name text box, specify the name of the subset.
The name is used in Sheet Set Manager and for the folder in which new
sheets will be created.
4. Click the ellipsis (...) button to the right of Store New Sheet DWG Files In.
The Browse for Folder dialog box appears.
5. Browse to and select the folder that represents the subset. Click Open.
The selected folder will be used to store any new drawings that are cre-
ated when you create new sheets under the subset.
6. If you want the folder to be created relative to its parent in the tree on
the Sheet List tab, select the Create Folders Relative to Parent Subset
Storage Location.
A new folder is created as necessary, based on the options you specify.
7. Click the ellipsis button to the right of Sheet Creation Template for
Subset.
The Select Layout as Sheet Template dialog box appears.
8. Browse to and select the drawing template that should be used when a
new sheet is created under the subset. Select the layout to use for new
sheets in the Select a Layout to Create New Sheets list and click OK.
If the Prompt for Template option is checked, the user of the sheet set will
be prompted to specify a drawing template when a new sheet is created
under the subset.
9. Click OK.
The Subset Properties dialog box closes, and the new subset is created.
You can control the order in which sheets and subsets appear on the Sheet
List tab by dragging them up and down. Sheets can also be added to a subset
by dragging them onto a subset or into a specific location within a subset.
Setting up a sheet set and subset 
for adding new sheets
Sheets can be created at both the sheet set and the subset level. To make
this process as streamlined as possible, you must do some minor setup for
each of these areas of a sheet set. Three properties need to be set, and they
are the same between the sheet set and subset. The only difference in the
process is how you access the properties.
Setting up drawing template settings for a sheet set
The following steps explain how to change the properties used for a new
sheet that is added to the root level of a sheet set. I assume you already have

7. In the Drawing Template File Name text box, enter the path and file
name for a drawing template file. Or click the ellipsis button to
browse for and select a drawing template (DWT) file.
If the ellipsis button is clicked, the Select Drawing dialog box is dis-
played. Browse to and select the drawing, drawing template, or drawing
standards file that contains the layout you want to use as the template
for new sheets. Click Open to close the Select Drawing dialog box and
return to the Select Layout as Sheet Template dialog box.

8. In the Select a Layout to Create New Sheets list box, select the layout
you want to use as the sheet template and then click OK.
The Select Layout as Sheet Template dialog box closes, and the specified
drawing file and selected layout are applied to the Sheet Creation
Template property in the Sheet Set Properties dialog box.
9. In the Sheet Creation area, specify Yes or No in the Prompt for
Template property.
The Prompt for Template property controls whether the template specified
in the sheet creation template is used when a new sheet is created. You can
use the specified sheet creation template or one of your own choosing.
10. Click OK.
The Sheet Set Properties dialog box closes and the changes to the prop-
erties are applied to the sheet set.
Setting up drawing template settings for a subset
Setting up a drawing template to use when a new sheet is created under the
subset is similar to setting up a sheet set. Refer to the preceding topic for
information on setting up the properties related to defining how a new sheet
is added to a sheet set. The following steps provide a quick walkthrough of
how to access the properties of a subset (not a full in-depth walkthrough of
each property) and assume that you have a sheet set open in Sheet Set
Manager. To open a sheet set, refer to the “Opening a sheet set” section.
1. In Sheet Set Manager’s Sheet List tab, right-click the subset for which
you want to adjust the properties and choose Properties.
The Subset Properties dialog box appears.
2. Specify the subset’s name, the location where the sheets will be cre-
ated, the drawing template that will be used when adding new sheets
to the subset, and whether the user will be prompted to specify a
drawing template when a new sheet is added to the subset.
The properties in the Subset Properties dialog box, except for the Subset
Name field, are the same as those in the Sheet Creation area of the Sheet
Set Properties dialog box. See the “Setting up drawing template settings
for a sheet set” section for more information on these properties.
3. Click OK.
The Subset Properties dialog box closes and the changes to the proper-
ties are saved.

Adding a new sheet
You can add a new sheet to a sheet set or a subset. How the new sheet is
defined is based on the properties that have been set up for the sheet set or
subset. When a new sheet is created, a new drawing file is also created. The
new drawing then has its layout referenced into the sheet set file at the loca-
tion that the new sheet was created. After you define the properties for the
sheet set or subset, a new sheet is rather easy to create.
The following steps explain how to add a new sheet to either the root level
of a sheet set or to a subset, and assumes that you already have a sheet set
open in Sheet Set Manager. To open a sheet set, refer to the “Opening a sheet
set” section.
1. In Sheet Set Manager’s Sheet List tab, right-click the sheet set or subset
in which you want to add a new sheet.
2. On the shortcut menu, click New Sheet.
The New Sheet dialog box appears (see Figure 2-9). The dialog box
allows you to specify a number, a title, and a file name for the new sheet,
and open the new sheet after it is created.
3. In the Number text box, enter a drawing number for the sheet.
The number can be displayed in a title block through the use of a field or
as part of the index sheet table, and is shown in the tree view on the
Sheet List tab.
4. In the Sheet Title text box, type a title for the sheet.
The title can be displayed in a title block through the use of a field or as
part of the index sheet table, and is shown in the tree view on the Sheet
List tab.
5. In the File Name text box, type a file name for the sheet.
AutoCAD uses the file name you enter to save the new sheet to the spec-
ified location in the Folder Path text box.
Figure 2-9:

6. Click OK.
The New Sheet dialog box closes and the new sheet is added to the
sheet set or the subset. Optionally, select the Open in Drawing Editor
option to open the new sheet after it’s created.
New in AutoCAD 2009, after you add a new sheet you now have 
the option to open it right away by selecting the Open in Drawing
Editor option in the New Sheet dialog box.
Opening a sheet
To open a sheet from a sheet set, you double-click the sheet. The drawing
that the sheet references is opened, along with the specific layout within the
drawing that is associated with the sheet. If you want, you can also right-
click a sheet and choose Open or Open Read-only from the shortcut menu.
Removing, renaming, and renumbering a sheet
At times you may find yourself needing to remove, rename, or renumber a
sheet based on whether it is being moved in a sheet set or no longer needed.
Removing a sheet from a sheet set allows you to get rid of it when you no
longer need it. To remove a sheet from a sheet set, right-click the sheet and
choose Remove Sheet from the shortcut menu. When asked to confirm the
removal of the sheet, click OK. AutoCAD removes the sheet only from the
sheet set; it does not remove from disk the actual drawing file that is linked
to the sheet.
You can change the title and number of a sheet through the Rename &
Renumber Sheet dialog box (see Figure 2-10). This dialog box allows you to
change the number of the sheet, its title and layout name in the drawing file,
and even the file name of the drawing file that the layout is contained in. To
rename and renumber a sheet, right-click the sheet and choose Rename &
Renumber from the shortcut menu. Change the number and title in the
dialog box, and, if you want, the layout and file name of the drawing as well.
You can navigate to the next or previous sheet in the subset and rename or
renumber it without leaving the dialog box.
AutoCAD 2009 allows you to rename the layout and drawing that is associ-
ated with a sheet in a sheet set. From the Rename & Renumber Sheet dialog
box, you can rename a sheet’s layout to match the sheet title and number,
and you can rename the drawing file that the sheet is contained in so that it
matches the sheet’s title and number.
Although you can use AutoCAD or Windows Explorer to rename drawing
files, it’s best to use Sheet Set Manager to rename drawings linked to a sheet
in a sheet set to avoid missing drawing files.

Sheet set and sheet properties
Sheet sets and individual sheets use two types of properties, standard and
custom. Standard properties are available for you to use without doing any
additional setup. Standard properties can be accessed by right-clicking the
top-level node of the sheet set or the sheet and selecting Properties. Based
on which one you right-click, different properties are available. Some of these
properties can be referenced in a text or attribute object through fields.
Custom properties require a little more work because you need to define the
property before you can use it. Custom properties allow you to incorporate
the use of sheet sets into your current drafting process much more easily
because you can define properties that you may be accustomed to using
during your project management cycle for client, drafter, or project informa-
tion. Although sheet sets and sheets come with predefined properties for
you to use, they do not cover everything that you might want to store with a
sheet set or sheet. Custom properties, like standard properties, can be dis-
played in a title block through fields.
The following steps explain how to define a custom property for a sheet and
then change its value. I assume that you already have a sheet set open in Sheet
Set Manager. To open a sheet set, refer to the “Opening a sheet set” section.
1. In Sheet Set Manager’s Sheet List tab, right-click the top-level node
that displays the sheet set’s name and choose Properties.
The Sheet Set Properties dialog box appears.
2. Click Edit Custom Properties.
The Custom Properties dialog box appears (see Figure 2-11). The dialog
box allows you to add and modify custom properties that you can have
at the sheet or sheet set level. These custom properties allow you to
populate information down to title blocks in your sheets so that the
information can be edited from a central location without opening each
sheet individually.

3. Click Add.
The Add Custom Property dialog box appears (see Figure 2-12). This is
where you define a new sheet set or sheet property.
4. In the Name text box, type a name for the custom property.
The name of the property can be pretty much anything you want to use.
The property created is accessible in the Sheet Set Properties, Sheet
Properties, and Field dialog boxes.
5. In the Default Value text box, type an initial value for the property.
This value is the default value for the property.
6. In the Owner area, select the Sheet Set option.
The owner type controls where the property will be accessible from,
even though both types of custom properties are created through the
Sheet Set Properties dialog box.
7. Add a sheet custom property by repeating Steps 3 through 6, but in
Step 6 select the Sheet option.

8. Click OK.
The Add Custom Property dialog box closes and you are returned to the

listed. After the custom property is created, you can change only its
default value. If you want to change its name or owner, you need to
delete the custom property and then re-create it. Be careful about delet-
ing custom properties; if the custom property is used in a field, it will
become unresolved because it no longer exists. Double-click the default
value for the custom property to edit the value.
9. In the Custom Properties dialog box, click OK.
The Custom Properties dialog box closes, and you are returned to the
Sheet Set Properties dialog box. If you added a custom property that had
its owner set to Sheet Set, the properties are displayed in the Sheet Set
Custom Properties section (see Figure 2-13). Also notice that custom
properties designated as an owner of Sheet are displayed in the Sheet
Custom Properties section. This allows you to change the default value
of a sheet’s custom property that is applied when a new sheet is created.
10. In the Sheet Set Properties dialog box, click OK.
The Sheet Set Properties dialog box closes and you are returned to
Sheet Set Manager.
11. In Sheet Set Manager, right-click the sheet whose custom properties
you want to change and choose Properties.
The Sheet Properties dialog box appears (see Figure 2-14).
12. In the Sheet Custom Properties section, change the value of the
custom sheet property .
Click in the text box next to the custom property and make the change
to its value.

13. Click OK.
The Sheet Properties dialog box closes and you return to Sheet Set
Manager. The sheet set and sheet properties and their values are dis-
played in the Preview/Details pane at the bottom of Sheet Set Manager
when an item in the tree view of the Sheet List tab is selected. If the
Preview/Details pane is not displayed, right-click an empty area of the tree
view and choose Preview/Details Pane. If the Details area is not displayed,
click the Details button just below the tree view on the Sheet List tab.
Setting up callouts and label blocks
You use callout and label blocks with model space views that are placed on a
sheet from the Model Views tab. Label blocks are automatically placed under
a model space view when placed onto a sheet. They commonly hold the
number and title for a view, and the scale of the viewport that is created to
show the view. Views that are placed on the sheets are numbered and titled
through the Rename & Renumber View dialog box from the Sheet Views tab.
Placing views on a sheet is discussed in the “Adding model views to a sheet”
section.
Callout blocks, unlike label blocks, are not automatically placed in a drawing.
A callout block typically has the view number and the sheet number on
which the view is placed. The callout points to a particular side of a building
plan, indicating where the elevation or view is located in the sheet set.

When a callout block is added to a sheet, AutoCAD creates a hyperlink back
to the sheet on which the view is placed. This allows you to move quickly to
the sheet with the view on it by holding down the Ctrl key while double-
clicking the callout block.
Callout and label blocks use fields to reference information contained in the
sheet set. These fields are defined through the SheetSetPlaceholder field
name in the SheetSet category in the Fields dialog box. To find more about
fields, refer to Book III. For information on creating blocks, refer to Book VI.
Setting up label blocks
The following steps explain how to define label blocks for placing with
model space views. I assume that you have a sheet set open in Sheet Set
Manager. To open a sheet set, refer to the “Opening a sheet set” section.
1. In Sheet Set Manager’s Sheet List tab, right-click the top-level node
that displays the sheet set’s name and choose Properties.
The Sheet Set Properties dialog box is displayed.
2. In the Sheet Set area, click the Label Block for Views text box to dis-
play an ellipsis (...) button.
3. Click the ellipsis button to specify a block or drawing file.
The Select Block dialog box appears (see Figure 2-15). You can use this
dialog box to browse for a drawing file and then use the drawing file as
the label block, or select a block from the drawing as a label block.
4. Click the ellipsis button to the right of the Enter the Drawing File
Name text box.
The Select Drawing dialog box appears, allowing you to select a drawing
or drawing template (DWT) file that contains the block you want to use
as a label block.

5. Browse to and select the drawing or drawing template file that con-
tains the label block you want to use when placing model space views.
Click Open.
The Select Drawing dialog box closes and the selected file is added to
the Select Block dialog box.
6. In the Select Block dialog box, select the Select the Drawing File as a
Block option or the Choose Blocks in the Drawing File option.
The selected option determines which block is used for a label block.
7. If you select Choose Blocks in the Drawing File, select a block from
the list box.
The selected block is used as the label block.
8. Click OK.
The Select Block dialog box closes, and the block name and path are
assigned to the Label Block for Views property in the Sheet Set
Properties dialog box.
9. In the Sheet Set Properties dialog box, click OK.
The Sheet Set Properties dialog box closes, and the changes are saved.
Setting up callout blocks
Setting up callout blocks is similar to setting up a label block, except you can
associate multiple blocks from a drawing for use as callout blocks. The fol-
lowing steps explain how to define which callout blocks are available for
placing in a drawing with a model space view on a sheet, and assumes that
you have a sheet set open in Sheet Set Manager. To open a sheet set, refer to
the “Opening a sheet set” section.
1. In Sheet Set Manager’s Sheet List tab, right-click the top-level node
that displays the sheet set’s name and choose Properties.
The Sheet Set Properties dialog box appears.
2. In the Sheet Set area, click the Callout Blocks text box to display an
ellipsis (...) button.
3. Click the ellipsis button to specify a block or drawing file.
The List of Blocks dialog box (see Figure 2-16) appears.
4. Click Add.
The Select Block dialog box appears, allowing you to browse for a draw-
ing file, and use the drawing file as the callout block or select a block(s)
from the drawing as a callout block.

Adding resource drawings
Sheet sets allow you to take advantage of model space views that you have
defined in drawings that might or might not be part of the sheet set. The
drawings with model views might be details or other parts of a drawing that
might be commonly shared with one or more projects. The location of these
drawings needs to be made available to Sheet Set Manager for you to place
the model views onto a sheet. Resource drawings are defined through the
Figure 2-16:
The List of
Blocks
dialog box.

Managing Drawings with a Sheet Set
538
Model Views tab of Sheet Set Manager. The locations added for resource draw-
ings most commonly contain details or elevations but can also be for plans.
The following steps explain how to define a drawing resource location for a
sheet set. I assume that you already have a sheet set open in Sheet Set
Manager. To open a sheet set, refer to the “Opening a sheet set” section.
1. In Sheet Set Manager’s Model Views tab, click the Add New Location
button (along the top).
The Browse for Folder dialog box appears.
2. Specify the folder that contains the drawings with the model views
that you want to place on a sheet. Click Open.
AutoCAD loads all the drawings from the folder you select into the
Locations section on the Model Views tab of Sheet Set Manager (see
Figure 2-17).
Adding model views to a sheet
After you have set up the callout and label blocks and the resource drawings
for the sheet set, you’re ready to place model space views on a sheet. Model
space views must first be created and saved in a drawing that is in the loca-
tion where your resource drawings are stored. A model view can be assigned
a category and a layer state. The layer state affects how layers appear in the
viewport that’s created when the model view is added to a sheet. The cate-
gory is used to organize views on Sheet Set Manager’s Sheet Views tab, and
in ShowMotion, which allows you to navigate a drawing by accessing named
views from the status bar area. For information on model views and
ShowMotion, see Chapter 3 of Book II.

Model views that are placed on a sheet don’t introduce any new concepts in
AutoCAD, but they do use a combination of existing features. Model views
use named views to define what is to be displayed, xrefs to get the geometry
into the Model space of the drawing that the sheet is part of, viewports to
display the xref’d drawing, and blocks and attributes to help link the infor-
mation from a sheet set to the attributes in the callout and label blocks that
are placed on the sheet.
The following procedure explains how to place a model view on a sheet and
adjust the number and title for the view that is placed. The procedure
assumes that you have defined a resource location for drawings that con-
tains the model space views you want to place on a sheet, specified a label
block to use for the sheet set, set up the properties for creating a new sheet,
and have a sheet set open. If you need help with any of these tasks, refer to
previous sections in this chapter.
1. On Sheet Set Manager’s Sheet List tab, create a new sheet or open an
existing one. The model space views will be placed on the sheet, so
make sure that the sheet is open before you continue.
2. On the Model Views tab, click the plus sign next to one of the draw-
ings defined by the resource location under the Locations pane.
The node for the drawing is expanded and any views contained in the
drawing are displayed as nodes below it.
3. Using the left mouse button, select one of the model views below the
drawing; continue to hold down the mouse button and drag the view
over the drawing window.
As you drag the view, the name of the view is dragged with the cursor.
You can also right-click a model view and choose Place on Sheet.
4. Release the mouse button over the drawing window to start the refer-
encing process.
A preview of the view is displayed for dragging in the drawing window
along with the label block that is configured for the sheet set. The label
block is located below the lower-left corner of the viewport.
5. Right-click the drawing window to specify a specific scale for the view.
AutoCAD guesses at a scale based on the size of the drawing and the
view that is being referenced. By right-clicking, you can choose the scale
you want to use from the shortcut menu.
6. Select a scale from the shortcut menu to use for the view.
The preview image that is being dragged is updated to reflect the new
scale.
7. Pick a point in the drawing window to place the model view, and
create the viewport and insert the label block.

Managing Drawings with a Sheet Set
540
The viewport is created based on the specified scale, and the label block
is inserted below the viewport.
8. On the Sheet Views tab, locate the view that was added to the tree
based on the sheet name or category of the view placed. Right-click
the view and select Rename & Renumber.
The Rename & Renumber View dialog box appears (see Figure 2-18).
9. In the Rename & Renumber View dialog box, enter a number in the
Number text box for the view. A title should already exist, because it
is the name of the model space view.
The number can be any text you want, but usually it’s a number with
maybe a letter. Click the Previous or Next buttons to continue renaming
views without leaving the dialog box.
10. Click OK.
The Rename & Renumber View dialog box closes, and you return to
Sheet Set Manager.
11. At the command prompt, type regen and press Enter.
Fields are not updated until an action in the drawing causes a regen or a
save. The field in the label block will be updated with the number and
title changes that you made in the Rename & Renumber View dialog box.
12. On the Sheet List tab, open a sheet that needs to have callout blocks
added to it to reference the sheet with the model view on it. Zoom to
the location where the callout block needs to be inserted.
The sheet opens in its open drawing window.
13. On the Sheet Views tab, locate the view in which you need to place
callout blocks. Right-click the view and select Place Callout Block, and
then select the block you want to place.
A preview of the callout block appears in the drawing window and is
ready to be placed.

The first time you place a callout block for the view, the option Select
Blocks may appear on the shortcut menu only. If Select Blocks is on the
shortcut menu, click it to display the View Category dialog box so you
can set up the callout blocks that you can place for a view. In the Select
the Callout Blocks to Be Used in This Category list box, place a check
mark next to each block you want to use as a callout block. Click OK
14. Pick a point in the drawing window to place the callout block.
The callout block is inserted into the drawing and any fields should be
resolved.
Publishing, eTransmitting, and Archiving a Sheet Set
After you create all the sheets for your sheet set and add any views that you
need on a sheet, you can package the set and send it off to the client. An
entire sheet set or selected sheets can be published by using the page setup
that is assigned to each layout or a page setup override, along with the abil-
ity to publish the sheets to a multisheet DWF or DWFx file. To work with the
publish options for a sheet set, right-click the top-level node of the sheet set
and choose an option from the Publish submenu. I explain publishing in
Chapter 3 of this minibook.
eTransmitting and archiving a sheet set are similar. When you eTransmit a
sheet set, you create a package of all the drawings and support files (includ-
ing xrefs) that are used with that sheet set to send to a client or customer
electronically. When you archive a sheet set, you are essentially doing an
eTransmit, but the package is not sent to a client or customer. You can
eTransmit a subset within a sheet set, but you can’t archive a subset. You
can archive only the entire sheet set.
You can start the eTransmit process by right-clicking the sheet set or a
subset and choosing eTransmit, or by using the ETRANSMIT command out-
side Sheet Set Manager when the sheet set is open. Doing so opens the
Create Transmittal dialog box.
To create an archive of a sheet set, right-click the sheet set node and click
Archive, or use the ARCHIVE command when the sheet set is open in Sheet
Set Manager. Doing so opens the Archive a Sheet Set dialog box.
For information on using the eTransmit and archive features of sheet sets,
refer to AutoCAD’s online Help system.

E
ven with the growth of the Internet and online project collaboration
sites, many people still want or need drawings to be delivered in hard-
copy format — in other words, printed. Many years ago, the idea of a paper-
less society was born with the introduction of the Internet. Despite what
some predicted, however, our dependency on paper has not dwindled that
much, so you still need to hang onto those printers and plotters for the time
being.
Throughout this book, I’ve covered many of the necessary techniques to set
up your drawings and prepare them for output. Page setups and layouts
play an important role in getting your drawings onto a sheet of paper, but to
get to the finish line, you need to do a bit more work yet. This chapter looks
at configuring a printer or plotter to output your drawings and also covers
plot styles, which can be used to affect how the linework of your drawing
looks when it’s outputted.
You Say Printing, I Say Plotting, They Say Publishing
Printing, plotting, and publishing are all terms that I cover in this chapter. For
the most part, they all produce the same result: a hard copy or an electronic
file for sharing from your drawing files. The process of getting to the end
result varies, based on which path you decide to take. In AutoCAD, printing
usually involves small drawings that can be output to a laser or inkjet
printer. Output is usually done on an 81⁄2 × 11 sheet of paper, but might also
be 11 × 17, based on your printer’s capabilities. Most AutoCAD users think
of printing as something that word processing and spreadsheet programs
do, whereas plotting is what AutoCAD does.
Plotting is a common way of outputting a drawing from AutoCAD to a hard
copy because drawing files are usually printed on very large sheets of paper.
Plotting requires specialized hardware that holds rolls of paper in different

You Say Printing, I Say Plotting, They Say Publishing
544
widths for printing drawings that are often greater in size than 81⁄2 × 11 or 
11 × 17. Some older plotters required you to manually load sheets of paper.
Based on the plotter you have available, it might also be able to print 81⁄2 × 11
and 11 × 17 sheets. When a drawing is printed or plotted, only the Model tab
or a paper space layout can be sent to a device at a single time. To get
around this limitation, you can use the publishing feature in AutoCAD.
Publishing is used to output more than just the Model tab or one paper space
layout at a time. Publishing allows you to set up multiple drawings and lay-
outs contained in the files for outputting to a device. This can make sending
out a drawing set easier because a list of drawings and layouts can be saved
for future use. You can publish all the sheets in a sheet set directly from
Sheet Set Manager. For more information on sheet sets and Sheet Set
Manager, see Chapter 2 of this minibook.
Working with drivers
To use printers and plotters with software, you often have to install addi-
tional software called print drivers. Print drivers come from the hardware
manufacturer and provide a way for software applications such as AutoCAD
to communicate with them. So when you or someone from your IT depart-
ment installs a printer through Windows, you are setting up what AutoCAD
refers to as a system printer. System printers are the printers that AutoCAD
and other Windows-based applications have access to. For most applica-
tions this is enough, but AutoCAD is not just any ordinary program.
AutoCAD allows manufacturers to develop a form of print drivers that 
can enhance the abilities of their printers or plotters in a way that can’t be
done through a standard print driver. AutoCAD refers to these drivers as
nonsystem drivers, which means that the driver can’t be installed as part 
of the Windows operating system. Most companies that develop plotters,
such as Hewlett-Packard (HP), Xerox, and Océ, develop custom drivers that
AutoCAD can use. These drivers are often much more efficient and flexible in
communicating with the printer or plotter the driver is designed for. Some of
the improvements in nonsystem drivers allow you to control which paper
sizes are available, as well as additional features such as line merge and
AutoSpool.
It’s much easier to set up and use system drivers than it is nonsystem driv-
ers. The ease of setup and use of system drivers is balanced out by the
better control that nonsystem drivers offer. Because printing and plotting in
AutoCAD is so different from other Windows-based applications, the Help
system offers some great information on the topic. For additional informa-
tion on print drivers, launch the online Help for AutoCAD; on the Contents
tab, expand Driver and Peripheral Guide and then choose Use Plotters and
Printers.

Configuring a printer or plotter
Configuring a device for AutoCAD usually requires a little more work than
installing a system printer. At times, you might even find that configuring a
system printer as a nonsystem printer might have some advantages. The
first thing you want to do before configuring a new device is to determine
whether it may have already been configured for you. (CAD managers and IT
personnel often set up printers and plotters to ensure that there is consis-
tency to the output for all drafters.) After you have determined which
devices you have available, you can set up a new one if you need to.
Determining which printers and plotters are available
The first step on the road to plotting is making sure that AutoCAD can
access the device to which you want to output. The following steps explain
how to see which system and nonsystem printers are available:
1. Right-click the command window or drawing area and choose Options.
2. In the Options dialog box, click the Plot and Publish tab.
The Plot and Publish tab (see Figure 3-1) is set current.

Nonsystem printers
Hide System Printers option
Figure 3-1:
Many of the
plotting and

are in the
Options

You Say Printing, I Say Plotting, They Say Publishing
546
3. In the Default Plot Settings for New Drawings area, click the down
arrow on the Use as Default Output Device drop-down list.
Both system and nonsystem printers are displayed in the drop-down
list, unless the Hide System Printers option has been selected in the
General Plot Options section.
• System printers are indicated by an icon that shows a small laser
printer with a sheet of paper on top next to its configured name in
Windows.
• Nonsystem printers are indicated by an icon that shows a plotter
with a sheet of paper coming out in front next to its configured name
in AutoCAD.
Nonsystem printers configured for AutoCAD are displayed in the list
with the PC3 file extension, which stands for AutoCAD Plotter
Configuration and the third generation of the file format. The PC3 files
were first used with AutoCAD 2000 and are still used with AutoCAD 2009
and AutoCAD LT 2009.
4. Click somewhere other than the Use as Default Output Device drop-
down list to close the drop-down list.
AutoCAD has access to all the system printers and some select nonsys-
tem printers out of the box. The nonsystem printers that are available
by default allow you to produce output to electronic files, such as DWF,
DWFx, and PDF files, and some that create commonly used raster image
files used with the Publish to Web feature. Now that you have an idea of
which printers and plotters are available to you from AutoCAD, you
should know if you are missing one that your office uses on a daily basis
for production drawings.
5. Click Cancel to close the Options dialog box.
Setting up a nonsystem printer
AutoCAD provides a wizard to help you set up nonsystem printers. You can
access the wizard from within AutoCAD or through the Windows Control
Panel. No matter which method you use, the Add Plotter Wizard is displayed.
You use the PLOTTERMANAGER command to display a window that allows
you to access the wizard and any previously defined nonsystem printers.
To start Plotter Manager, do one of the following:
✦On the ribbon, click Output tab➪Plot panel➪Plotter Manager.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click File menu➪Plotter Manager.
✦At the command prompt, type PLOTTERMANAGER and press Enter.

You Say Printing, I Say Plotting, They Say Publishing
547
✦In the Options dialog box, click the Plot and Publish tab, and then in 
the Default Plot Settings for New Drawings area, click Add or Configure
Plotters.
The following steps explain how to launch the Add Plotter Wizard and create
a nonsystem printer:
1. Open Plotter Manager by using one of the methods in the 
preceding list.
The Plotters window is displayed.
2. Locate the Add-A-Plotter Wizard shortcut and double-click it.
The Add Plotter Wizard is launched.
3. Read through the information on the Introduction page, and click
Next.
The next page of the wizard is displayed and is really the starting point
of configuring a new nonsystem printer (see Figure 3-2).
4. Select one of the three types of plotters to set up. For this example,
select My Computer. Click Next.
The page allows you to choose from three different types of plotters:
• My Computer: The plotting is handled locally by your computer
through a port, through a plot to a file, or by using a specified
AutoSpool utility (an application that controls where the plot file is
sent).
• Network Plotter Server: The plotting is done through a folder in a
network location where the plotter checks for plot files.
Figure 3-2:
The Add

You Say Printing, I Say Plotting, They Say Publishing
548
• System Printer: The plotting is done through a system printer. By
configuring a nonsystem printer for a system printer, you allow
AutoCAD to take advantage of additional features that can change
the way the plot information is handled before it’s sent to the system
printer.
Note: Clicking Next advances the wizard to the next page, which is differ-
ent depending on which of the three options you selected. In this exam-
ple, I use the My Computer option because it covers the most steps in
the wizard.
5. On the Plotter Model page, select a manufacturer from the list on the
left and then one of the available models from the list on the right.
For this example, select Autodesk ePlot (DWF) from the Manufacturers
list and DWF eView (optimized for viewing) from the Models list. Click
Next.
Based on the selected manufacturer, you might have a list of models for
a physical device or a virtual device. A physical device is a plotter that
you can see and touch, whereas a virtual device allows you to take the
output from AutoCAD and convert it into a specific file format.
6. If you have a PCP or PC2 file that you want to use, do the following.
Otherwise, click Next to continue.
a. Click the Import File button.
PCP files were the first plotter configuration files that AutoCAD used
and were created with AutoCAD R13 and earlier releases. PC2 files
were the second generation of the plotter configuration file type and
were created with AutoCAD R14.
b. In the Import dialog box, browse to and select a PCP or PC2 file
that was exported out of an earlier release.
c. Click Import.
d. In the Imported Data Information dialog box, click OK.
You might see a warning message about paper sizes not matching
between the device you are configuring and the device contained in
the PCP or PC2 file. Click OK to the warning message. The Imported
Data Information message should be displayed after the warning
message (if one was displayed). The Imported Data Information mes-
sage displays the settings that have been imported for the plotter
that you are configuring. Click OK to close the Imported Data
Information dialog box, and you return to the Add Plotter Wizard.
e. Click Next.

7. In the Add Plotter Wizard on the Ports page, select the type of port to
be used for the plotter, and then select a port from the list based on
the port option you selected. Click Next.
You can choose from three types of ports:
• Plot to Port: Allows for output to be sent to a location such as LPT1
or a UNC path. This option depends on whether you selected a phys-
ical or virtual plotting device.
• Plot to File: Specifies that the output will be created as an electronic
file that can then be viewed or sent to a graphics or print shop for
printing.
• AutoSpool: Specifies that the output should be sent to an application
that determines how to route the output file. The program used for
AutoSpool is specified on the Files tab of the Options dialog box in
the Print File, Spooler, Prolog Section Names, Print Spool Executable
node. An AutoSpool program can be used to log plots or even redi-
rect output based on paper size.
8. On the Plotter Name page, enter a name in the Plotter Name text box.
Click Next.
The name you enter is displayed in the lists that allow you to specify an
output device in AutoCAD and is also used for the name of the PC3 file
that is created when the wizard is finished.
9. On the Finish page, click Edit Plotter Configuration or Calibrate
Plotter to further configure the new device. Click Finish.
Based on the device you are configuring, the Calibrate Plotter button
might be disabled. The Calibrate Plotter button allows you to verify
drawing measurements that the device can handle. The Edit Plotter
Configuration button launches the Plotter Configuration Editor dialog
box (see Figure 3-3) and allows you to specify custom paper sizes and
other device specific settings. Make any necessary changes in the
Plotter Configuration Editor dialog box, and click OK to save changes
and close the dialog box. To find more about the options in the Plotter
Configuration Editor dialog box, click the Help button to open the online
Help system to the page in help specific to this dialog box.
In the Plotters window, the new device is added and ready for use in
AutoCAD.

Editing a nonsystem printer configuration
At times, you may want to edit a nonsystem printer configuration to add or
remove available paper sizes, along with options such as line merge. The fol-
lowing procedure explains how to modify a plotter configuration (PC3) file
for a nonsystem printer:
1. Open Plotter Manager by using one of the previously listed methods.
2. In the Plotters window, double-click the plotter configuration (PC3)
file you want to edit.
The Plotter Configuration Editor dialog box is displayed.
3. In the Plotter Configuration Editor dialog box, make the necessary
changes.
4. Click Save & Close.
The changes are saved to the PC3 file.
5. Click the X on the Plotters window to close it.
Putting style in your plots
AutoCAD uses plot styles to control the output of objects in a drawing. Plot
styles can be used to control the lineweights and even the colors in which
objects are plotted. Most printers and plotters in offices today are capable of

outputting in grayscale, whereas some may even support color. Even though
AutoCAD drawings are displayed and created in color, you can use plot
styles to control whether that is the same with the final output. Plot styles
can be used to map colors to grayscale colors or even to a different color
altogether.
AutoCAD supports two plot styles: color dependent and named. Color-
dependent plot styles are the most commonly used of the two and represent
how plotting was handled before the introduction of plot styles in AutoCAD
2000. Color-dependent plot styles allow you to map specific AutoCAD colors
to different lineweights and even to different colors. Although AutoCAD sup-
ports true colors, which allows you to choose from about 16.7 million colors,
color-dependent plot styles utilize only the basic 255 colors of AutoCAD. So
AutoCAD maps true colors to the nearest AutoCAD Color Index (ACI) color.
When you create a new drawing, the drawing template determines the type
of plot style used when plotting.
You can switch from color-dependent or named plot styles in a drawing by
using the CONVERTPSTYLES command.
Named plot styles, the newest of the two plotting methods, allow you to
create a name and assign that name a specific lineweight and color. This
allows you to display multiple colors on-screen but use one plot style for
multiple layers and colors. You can apply a named plot style to a layer as
well as to individual objects in a drawing. You can’t override the plot style
assigned to a layer when using color-dependent plot styles unless you
change the color of the layer. Named plot styles, unlike color-dependent plot
styles, have some limitations. Named plot styles are not supported well
when it comes to objects such as tables and dimensions that can display
multiple colors and have multiple different levels of objects.
For example, a table can have a different color for the grid and text but can
be assigned only one plot style. In this case, the object is plotted by using
one named plot style; whereas if you use color-dependent plot styles, each
color can be plotted by using a different lineweight. Plot styles are saved in
files outside AutoCAD with the CTB (AutoCAD Color-Dependent Plot Style
Table) and STB (AutoCAD Plot Style Table—Named) file extensions. CTB
stands for color-dependent plot style table, and STB stands for named plot
style table.
You use the Add Plot Style Table Wizard to create new plot styles. Like the
Add Plotter Wizard, the Add Plot Style Table Wizard can be launched from
AutoCAD or the Windows Control Panel. The STYLESMANAGER command is
used to display the Plot Styles window, which allows you to access the Add
Plot Style Table Wizard and any previously defined plot styles.

552
To start the STYLESMANAGER command, do one of the following:
✦On the ribbon, click Output tab➪Plot panel➪Plot Style Manager.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click File menu➪Plot Style Manager.
✦At the command prompt, type STYLESMANAGER and press Enter.
✦In the Options dialog box, click the Plot and Publish tab, and then click
Plot Style Table Settings. In the Plot Style Table Settings dialog box, click
Add or Edit Plot Style Tables.
Setting up a plot style
The following steps use the Add Plot Style Table Wizard to create a color-
dependent plot style:
1. Open Plot Style Manager by using one of the previously listed methods.
A window titled Plot Styles is displayed.
2. Locate the Add-A-Plot Style Table Wizard shortcut and double-click it.
The Add Plot Style Table Wizard is launched.
3. In the Add Plot Style Table Wizard, read through the information and
then click Next.
The next page of the wizard is displayed and is really the starting point
for configuring a plot style table (see Figure 3-4).
4. Select one of the four methods for configuring a plot style. For this
procedure, select Start from Scratch. Click Next.
The four methods for configuring a plot style are
• Start from Scratch: Use this option if you’re not upgrading from a
release prior to AutoCAD 2000, or if you don’t want to base the new
plot style on an existing style.
• Use an Existing Plot Style Table: If you have an existing plot style
that’s close to the one you want to configure, use the existing one 
as a template for the new plot style.
• Use My R14 Plotter Configuration (CFG): Pen tables, as they once
were called in AutoCAD R14, were stored in a configuration (CFG)
file. If you have one of these files around, you can import the pen
information into the wizard for the new plot style.
• Use a PCP or PC2 File: AutoCAD R14 and earlier releases allowed
you to export your plot device configuration and pen table to a
single configuration file that could be shared with other computers.
The pen table contained in these files can be imported into the
wizard for the new plot style.

553
Clicking Next advances the wizard to the next page, which is different
based on which of the four options you selected. This set of steps uses
the Start from Scratch option.
5. On the Pick Plot Style Table page, select the Color-Dependent Plot
Style Table option or the Named Plot Style Table option. For this
example, click Color-Dependent Plot Style Table. Click Next.
Select the Color-Dependent or Named Plot Style Table option, based on
the type your drawings use.
6. In the File Name text box, enter a name. Click Next.
The name you enter is the one that’s displayed in the list of plot styles 
in AutoCAD and is also used for the name of the CTB or STB file that’s
created when the wizard is finished.
7. Click Plot Style Table Editor to configure the lineweights, colors, and
other settings for the new plot style.
The Plot Style Table Editor dialog box (see Figure 3-5) is displayed and
allows you to define how the linework will look when it’s plotted.
8. Select the color (or named plot style) in the Plot Styles list box on the
Form View tab. Then modify the properties based on how you want
the linework assigned to the plot style to appear when plotted.
Based on the plot style you are creating, you may want to assign a
lineweight or linetype property that will override the values assigned 
to the objects in a drawing when it’s plotted.
9. Click Save & Close.
The changes to the plot style are saved, and the new plot style is added
to the Plot Style window and is ready to use in AutoCAD.

10. In the Add Plot Style Table Wizard, click Finish.
The Add Plot Style Table Wizard closes.
11. Click the X in the Plot Styles window to close it.
Editing a plot style
As your CAD standards change, you may need to make changes to the colors
that you use for layers or the lineweights used during output. To edit a plot
style file:
1. Open the Plot Style Manager by using one of the previously listed
methods.
2. In the Plot Styles window, double-click the plot style (CTB or STB) file
you want to edit.
The Plot Style Table Editor dialog box is displayed.
3. Make the necessary changes and then click Save & Close.
The changes are saved to the CTB or STB file.
4. Click the X in the Plot Styles window to close it.

Plotting is not as easy as creating a line, for instance, and this is mainly due 
to the number of options that are available. Over the years, plotting has been
streamlined (after you define your plot configurations and plot styles), but you
still need to know a number of things before you can plot. This section helps
get you on the fast track to understanding plotting step by step. Depending on
whether you’re plotting from the Model tab or a paper space layout tab, the
general process is the same but some options are slightly different.
To plot out the Model tab or a paper space layout tab, you use the PLOT
command. (You don’t use the PRINT command, but those folks at Autodesk
did create a command alias so you can type PRINT at the command prompt
to get to the PLOT command.) To start the PLOT command, use one of the
following methods:
✦On the ribbon, click Output tab➪Plot panel➪Plot.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click File menu➪Plot.
✦On the Standard or Standard Annotation toolbar, click the Plot button.
✦Press Ctrl+P.
✦At the command prompt, type PLOT and press Enter.
✦On the status bar, click the Quick View Layouts button, and then click
the Plot icon when it is displayed as the mouse hovers over one of the
previews for a paper space layout.
✦Right-click the Model tab or paper space layout tab, and choose Plot.
Plotting the Model tab
The following procedure takes you through the basics of plotting from the
Model tab of a drawing:
1. Click the Model tab at the bottom of the drawing window or click the
Model button in the status bar area.
2. Start the PLOT command by using one of the previously listed methods.
The Plot dialog box (see Figure 3-6) is displayed.
3. If a named page setup is contained in your drawing, select it from the
Name drop-down list under the Page Setup heading and skip ahead to
Step 10. If you don’t have a named page setup, continue on with the
next step.
A page setup saves you the time of having to specify the name of the
printer/plotter, paper size, what to plot, scale, and other settings. Page
setups were covered in Chapter 1 of this minibook.

4. In the Printer/Plotter area, select a printer from the Name drop-
down list.
The drop-down list contains both the system and nonsystem printers,
unless the Hide System Printers option is selected on the Plot and
Publish tab of the Options dialog box.
5. In the Paper Size area, select the paper size on which your drawing
will best fit for the area that will be plotted and the designated scale.
The drop-down list contains all the available paper sizes that the device
can output to. If you’re using a PC3 file, you can add or remove paper
sizes from the list through the Plotter Configuration Editor dialog box.
For more information on editing a plotter configuration, see the “Editing
a nonsystem printer configuration” section in this chapter.
6. In the Number of Copies area, enter the number of copies you want to
produce.
This option is disabled if the selected device outputs to a file.
7. In the Plot Area heading, select what you want to plot in the drawing —
often, you select Extents when plotting from the Model tab.
The drop-down list contains a number of options to select from. These
options are

• Display: Outputs the objects that are currently displayed in the
drawing window.
• View: Allows you to plot the objects defined by a named view that is
saved in the drawing.
• Window: Allows you to specify a rectangular area in the drawing that
should be output by picking two points in the drawing. What is dis-
played inside the selected area is what is outputted.
• Limits: If you’ve properly set up the limits for your drawing, you 
can use this option to specify the objects that are displayed within
this area.
• Extents: Calculates the extents of the drawing and uses them to print
all the objects contained in the drawing.
8. In the Plot Offset area, either specify an X and a Y offset from the
edge of the printable area or select the Center the Plot check box.
The option that you selected in the Plot Area determines whether the
Center the Plot check box is enabled.
9. In the Plot Scale area, either specify the print area to be fit on the
specified paper size by selecting Fit to Paper, or deselect Fit to Paper
and specify a scale (by selecting a standard scale from the drop-down
list or entering a number in the text boxes for a custom scale).
During production, you specify a specific scale when plotting, but you
might choose Fit to Paper for a check plot or if you’re doing conceptual
designs and aren’t concerned about a specific scale. For more informa-
tion on scaling your drawing, see the “Scaling your drawing” section
later in this chapter.
10. Click Preview and verify that everything you want to plot will fit.
Then right-click and choose Exit to quit the Preview and return to the
Plot dialog box.
If you choose a specific plot scale and the scale doesn’t match the cur-
rent annotation scale, the Plot Scale Confirm dialog box is displayed.
Click Continue to continue to the preview of the drawing or Cancel to
return to the Plot dialog box and change the current plot scale. When
the preview is displayed, you can verify that the drawing fits on the
specified paper size and that it is not too small. If it is too small or the
wrong area of the drawing is displayed, return to the Plot dialog box and
make the necessary changes.
11. Click OK.
If the Plot Scale Confirm dialog box is displayed, click Continue or
Cancel as necessary. The drawing is sent to the specified printer or plot-
ter device, using the options that you selected.

You’ve created a basic plot in 11 steps. As I mention, however, other settings
can affect your plot, and those are covered in the “More plotting options”
section later in this chapter.
You can click the Apply to Layout button at the bottom of the Plot dialog box
to save the option changes that you just made. When you return to the Plot
dialog box the next time, the options are already set for you based on the
previous plot that you created.
After the plotting process has finished, you might see a small notification
balloon (see Figure 3-7) displayed in the lower-right corner of AutoCAD. This
balloon informs you when plotting has been completed successfully or if an
error was encountered. This notification is extremely handy if background
plotting is enabled, when you plot to a DWF or DWFx file, or when you’re
using the PUBLISH command. Both background plotting and the PUBLISH
command are explained later in this chapter.
If you plot to a DWF or DWFx file, you can right-click the Plot/Publish notifi-
cation balloon and choose View DWF File to open the last created DWF or
DWFx file in Autodesk Design Review. I cover viewing DWF and DWFx files in
Chapter 4 of Book VIII.
Plotting a paper space layout
In the preceding section, I discuss plotting a drawing from the Model tab.
Plotting a layout really is not much different, and if you have properly set up
your layouts in your drawing, plotting a drawing from a layout tab is actually
easier than plotting from the Model tab. The reason is that you don’t have to
worry about drawing scales because that has been defined for each of the
viewports on the layout. If you used a page setup for your layouts, your
device and paper sizes should already be defined as well. Otherwise, you
pretty much need to configure the name of the printer/plotter and paper
size, and set the plot scale to 1:1 and the layout to what you are plotting. 
The following steps outline how to plot a paper space layout:
1. Set one of the paper space layout tabs current.
To do so, click the tab at the bottom of the drawing window, or click the
Quick View Layouts button on the status bar area and then one of the
paper space layouts.

2. Start the PLOT command by using one of the previously listed methods.
The Plot dialog box is displayed.
3. If necessary, specify the printer/plotter, paper size, and number of
copies.
4. In the Plot Area section, select what you want to plot in the drawing —
often, you select Layout when plotting a paper space layout tab.
The drop-down list contains a number of options that you can select.
The only difference is that Layout is available only for plotting paper
space layouts and the Limits option is only available for plotting from
the Model tab. With the Layout option, all the objects on the layout that
fall within the specific printable area of the specified paper size are
printed.
5. In the Plot Offset area, specify an X and a Y offset from the edge of
the printable area.
6. In the Plot Scale area, specify a scale in the drop-down list. In almost
all cases, you should specify a scale of 1:1.
A scale of 1:1 is selected because the scale of the model geometry is
handled by each of the floating viewports on the layout.
7. Click Preview and verify that everything you want to plot will fit.
After you have finished verifying your drawing, right-click and 
choose Exit.
You return to the Plot dialog box
8. Click OK.
Scaling your drawing
When you output your drawings, you must specify a specific scale for your
drawing. This means you that don’t use the Fit to Paper check box in the
Plot dialog box much. If you are plotting from the Model tab, you specify a
drawing scale. The drawing scale is usually always determined upfront
before you begin drawing, and in Book I, Chapter 6 I explain how to calculate
this value. If you are plotting from a paper space layout, you use a scale of 1
to 1 (1:1) because the scaling of the geometry is handled by the floating
viewports on the layout.
More plotting options
The Plot dialog box has a button with an arrow on it located in the lower-
right corner (refer to Figure 3-6). This is a toggle that expands the Plot dialog
box and reveals additional settings that are not required to output a drawing
but do affect the appearance of the output. Following is a list of the addi-
tional options that are revealed when you click the More Options button:

✦Plot Style Table (Pen Assignments): Allows you to specify a plot style
that can be used to control the color and lineweights of the drawing
during output. You can use the Edit button to the right of the drop-down
list to edit the selected plot style. I cover plot styles in the “Putting style
in your plots” section earlier in this chapter.
✦Shaded Viewport: Controls how shaded and rendered views are output.
The Shade Plot drop-down list allows you to specify how views that
don’t have a specific visual style assigned to them are displayed. The
Quality drop-down list and the DPI text box control the resolution in
which shaded and rendered views are outputted.
✦Plot: Controls a wide range of settings:
• Plot in Background: Determines whether control of AutoCAD is
released after a plot is sent and the process of the plot is finished in
the background so you can get back to work sooner. If the option is
deselected, you have to wait until the plot has completed processing
and is sent to the printer or plotter before you can do anything else.
Enabling background plotting is slower, so if you need a plot right
away, don’t use background plotting.
You can control background plotting through the Plot and Publish
tab of the Options dialog box in the Background Processing Options
area. There’s an option for Plotting and one for Publishing (by
default, Publishing is the only one selected). I discuss how to publish
drawings in the next section.
• Plot Object Lineweights: Controls whether object lineweights
assigned to layers and objects are used instead of the assigned plot
style.
• Plot with Plot Styles: Controls whether plot styles are used when
plotting.
• Plot Paperspace Last: Controls whether paper space geometry is
plotted before model space geometry.
• Hide Paperspace Objects: Controls whether AutoCAD automatically
performs the HIDE command on the paper space layout.
• Plot Stamp On: Adds a plot stamp along the edge of the drawing
when it’s outputted. The plot stamp is configured by using the PLOT-
STAMP command or by clicking the Plot Stamp Settings button when
the Plot Stamp On option is selected.
• Save Changes to Layout: Specifies whether changes to the plotting
settings for the layout are saved when you click OK. This option
automatically saves the changes made to the plot options so you
don’t have to remember to click the Apply to Layout button before
clicking OK.

✦Drawing Orientation: Controls whether the drawing is plotted in the
portrait or landscape direction. You can also specify whether the draw-
ing is plotted upside down by selecting the Plot Upside-Down option.
Publishing Drawings
Using the PLOT command to output your drawings is easy if you have only a
few drawings or layouts for which you need to create hard copies, but it can
be a large task if you have many drawings and layouts to plot. The PUBLISH
command allows you to batch a number of drawings together to output
them all based on their defined page setups or override that page setup with
one of your choice. The other feature that the PUBLISH command supports
is creating single-sheet or multisheet DWF or DWFx files and controlling the
order in which drawings are output.
To start the PUBLISH command, use one of the following methods:
✦On the ribbon, click Output tab➪Publish panel➪Publish.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click File menu➪Publish.
✦On the Standard or Standard Annotation toolbar, click the Publish
button.
✦At the command prompt, type PUBLISH and press Enter.
✦On the status bar, click the Quick View Layouts button, and then click
the Publish icon when it is displayed as the mouse hovers over one of
the previews for a paper space layout.
✦Hold down the Ctrl key and select each paper space layout tab you want
to publish, right-click, and choose Publish Selected Layouts.
The following steps take you through the basics of using the Publish 
dialog box:
1. Start the PUBLISH command by using one of the methods in the pre-
ceding list.
The Publish dialog box (see Figure 3-8) is displayed. If no layout tabs
were selected, all the layouts from the drawings you have open are
pulled into the dialog box by default.
2. Click the Add Sheets button along the top of the dialog box to add lay-
outs from other drawings not currently open in AutoCAD.
The Select Drawings dialog box is displayed.

Publishing Drawings
562
3. Browse to and select the drawings whose layouts you want to add to
the Publish dialog box. Click Open.
The Select Drawings dialog box closes and all the layouts in the selected
drawings are imported into the list box.
4. If you do not want a layout that has been imported, select the layout
from the list, right-click, and choose Remove.
5. In the Publish To area, make a selection:
• Select Plotter Named in Page Setup to plot the layout based on the
last page setup used to output the layout.
• Select DWF format and either DWF file or DWFx file to plot to a DWF
file. Click Publish Options to control the behavior of plotting to a
DWF file.
6. Click Publish to start the publishing process.
The Save Sheet List dialog box is displayed.
7. Click Yes to save the list of sheets to a Drawing Set Description 
(DSD) file.
The DSD file can be reopened later in the Publish dialog box to republish
all the selected layouts in the sheet list again.
The Processing Background Plot dialog box (see Figure 3-9) is displayed
when background plotting is enabled for the PLOT or PUBLISH com-
mand. By default, AutoCAD displays the same notification balloon when
the PUBLISH command finishes as when the PLOT command finishes.
You can set the AUTOPUBLISH system variable to 1 to have AutoCAD auto-
matically create a DWF file each time a drawing is saved or closed. Setting
AUTOPUBLISH to 0 disables the automatic creation of DWF files when saving
or closing a drawing.

You can use the PUBLISHALLSHEETS system variable to control if only the
Model tab and/or layouts in the current drawing are added to the Publish
dialog box or if the Model tab and layouts from all open drawings is added. A
value of 0 loads only the layouts from the current drawing into the Publish
dialog box, and a value of 1 loads all the layouts from all open drawings.
The PUBLISHCOLLATE system variable controls whether a sheet set when
published is handled as multiple single-plot jobs or a single-plot job. A value
of 0 causes each sheet to be plotted as separate plot jobs, and a value of 1
plots all sheets as a single-plot job.
AutoCAD 2009 and AutoCAD LT 2009 introduce a new system variable named
PUBLISHHATCH. The PUBLISHHATCH system variable controls how hatch
objects are published to DWF or DWFx files. If a value of 0 is used, hatch
objects are published as separate objects; a value of 1 causes hatch objects
to be plotted as single objects. This does not affect how DWF and DWFx files
are viewed but does affect how hatch objects are imported into Autodesk
Impression.

A
utoCAD 2009 & AutoCAD LT 2009 All-in-One Desk Reference For
Dummies is designed to help both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT users
improve the quality of the designs that they publish and to effectively share
them with others. As you progress through this book, you discover how to
manage the drafting environment and CAD standards for your company and
some of the different ways to effectively work with drawing files.
CAD standards is a topic that isn’t discussed enough in the office, and yet
they play an important role in sharing drawing files. CAD standards ensure
that the drawings you create look similar to the drawings that everyone else
in the office creates. All the drawings should have the same look and feel
when they’re presented to a potential client or the shop floor. If your work
doesn’t have a uniform look, the client might get the impression that your
company doesn’t have enough experience to handle the project or is simply
disorganized, which can stop talks cold at the table.
After you’ve finished creating your set of drawings for a project, it’s usually
time to share them with others, whether a client or someone in manufactur-
ing. During this stage of a project, you might find that printing hard copies
and mailing them to the client or off-site team members can take a lot of
time. If you need a timely response to a question or a change, you’ll most
likely need to share files electronically. The type of file sharing you use
depends on your target audience and the phase of the project. You might
use a Web site to present and transfer files and images or use an Internet
project hosting site such as Buzzsaw. In the end, you have to ensure that
you can efficiently collaborate with your client and members of your design
team.

Getting a Handle on the Basics of CAD Management
CAD management refers to managing the day-to-day operations involved
with drafting; typically this includes processes related to and unrelated to
AutoCAD that must be followed to complete a project. CAD management is
not necessarily the sole responsibility of one individual in a company or
functional area, but often it is one individual who is assigned the official
duties of being the designated CAD manager. A CAD manager may or may
not be a supervisor — in the sense that we often think of a manager — at the
company.
If you work in a mid- to large-size company, you might have a full-time CAD
manager; in a smaller company, the CAD manager is more likely to be a
senior level drafter that pulls double duty. Some small companies even pool
their resources and hire an outside consultant to do their CAD management
tasks.
CAD management commonly covers the following areas:
✦Budgeting: Estimating the amount of money needed for a specific period
of time for CAD-related expenses. This might be software upgrade costs
(such as subscription fees), hardware purchases, office supplies (such
as paper for the plotter), training costs, and even consulting fees.
✦CAD standards enforcement: Making sure that all drafters are following
the company’s defined CAD standards — this is a responsibility that
many don’t like about CAD management. Ensuring that CAD standards
are followed, however, helps ensure that a high level of quality is main-
tained for drawings that are sent out.
✦Managing the drafting environment: Maintaining and managing support
files through a centralized location to make sure that all drafters are
using the same set of files when working with drawing files. This helps to
reduce potential errors and the extra cost of keeping the files in sync if
they’re all running locally on each user’s own computer. CAD managers
might do this themselves or bring in a consultant.
✦Conducting and coordinating training: Rolling out new procedures or
even providing upgrade training for a new release. Training for upgrades
might be outsourced, but the coordination of this training is usually 
handled by the individual responsible for CAD management in the office.
Training might be specific to what your company does or general soft-
ware training. If an outside company conducts your training, make sure
that the training is related to any company and departmental policies.
✦Resource management: Overseeing the resource pool of CAD drafters 
to ensure that current and future projects are completed in a timely
manner.

A project involves much more than just one drafter creating drawing files
with AutoCAD; instead, a whole team with specialized skills is usually at
work on a project. This team might include individuals who are responsible
for overseeing the project, drafters, estimators, manufactures and builders,
and the client. This is the same approach that should be taken with CAD
management and standards. One individual might have leadership responsi-
bility but everyone should be involved to a degree. Having everyone
involved at some level helps to ensure that the standards are widely
accepted and are uniform across the company.
Due to the growing complexity of projects these days, more people from dif-
ferent areas of the company are getting involved, so having representation
from across the company in defining CAD standards is a good idea. CAD
standards shouldn’t just stay in the drafting department: The output from
drawing files might be used for marketing material, in print or on the
Internet, and will surely end up in front of your clients as well. Clients end 
up reviewing drawings during many phases of a project, and, from these
drawings, they build a perception of your company’s skill level. For these
reasons, many people need to get involved with CAD standards.
Some of the most interesting ideas for improving CAD standards and using
the information maintained in a drawing file can come from different groups
in a company coming together. That doesn’t mean that everyone in the 
company should have a direct vote in what is part of the CAD standards, 
but getting feedback from individuals in the company who deal with the
information that is generated from a drawing file is a good idea. Often CAD
standards are thought of in terms of drawings only, but they encompass
everything related to how the CAD information is used.
Here are some items that are part of nontypical CAD standards that should
be looked at as a company:
✦Title blocks: Information added to a title block can be used downstream
to populate a project management system, if one exists.
✦Content of a drawing: How a drawing is created can affect how its infor-
mation can be used downstream for things such as renderings and ani-
mations that might be done by an internal or external art department.
✦Annotation, such as notes and dimensions: Some notes on a drawing
might be there for legal reasons; it’s good to have a company view on
these types of notes because the information might already be covered
in a bid packet or specification document.
✦AutoCAD support file locations: Companies want to make sure that file
access is optimal for all users throughout the company. This ensures an
efficient working environment and also ensures that everything is prop-
erly backed up in case of a catastrophe.

Managing the Drafting Environment

✦File exchange practices (use of e-mail or FTP sites): Policies in place for
the use of e-mail — such as the total allowable size of all files coming in
or going out during normal business hours — might delay the sending 
of information for a project. It’s wise to communicate with internal and
external departments to see what can be sent out efficiently without
conflicting with company e-mail policy. Your company may have an FTP
site that can be used to exchange large files with people.
✦Drawing name convention and storage locations: Naming conventions
are important so that individuals in the company can find a drawing file
in a timely manner. This could affect how the files might be archived and
the file rights that individuals may need to access them. Storing these
types of files in a centralized location on a network drive that is accessi-
ble to everyone is good practice.
✦Training, seminars, and learning material: Sending employees to train-
ing or purchasing training materials for them is often hard to justify
financially because at times the true return of investment (ROI) is
unclear. You must determine as a company how training is conducted
when a new release of AutoCAD comes out or a new individual is hired.
Managing the Drafting Environment
AutoCAD is a complex drafting program with many settings and support files
that it relies on. Proper management of the AutoCAD environment is not
something that just happens overnight. Given the sophisticated drafting
environment in AutoCAD, a small group of appointed individuals at your
company should be in charge of making updates to the support files that 
are used by the different drafters in your company. Having a small group in
charge of updates is especially critical in preventing unauthorized changes
that could affect new or existing drawings in a negative way when the files
are shared with a group of drafters. So what is included in the drafting 
environment?
When I mention the drafting environment, I’m not talking about background
colors or the size of the crosshairs — those things don’t affect the final
output of a drawing file. Instead, I’m referring to template files and where
they are located, along with the locations where AutoCAD looks for support
files such as blocks, fonts, and customization. When you install AutoCAD, it
often looks locally for things such as menu customization, hatch patterns,
blocks, fonts, drawing template files, and anything else that is ordinarily
shipped with the product. Because AutoCAD doesn’t force specific locations
for files, it allows you the flexibility to determine how you want to manage all
support files. The default out-of-the-box locations for support files are locally
on the computer, but this is not the best way to manage support files.

Commonly shared files should be stored in a networked location so they can
be accessed by all drafters. The reason for using a shared network location
is to make it easy to maintain and update the files. If a CAD standard changes
and all the drafters have a copy of the company support files on their local
drive, each computer would need to be updated one by one instead of just
updating the files on a network. Instead of letting users have their own
copies of the support files, you place a copy of the files that you want to
share and then redirect AutoCAD to look on the network.
All the support paths that AutoCAD uses to locate support files are on 
the Files tab of the Options dialog box. This means that you can have your
drawing template files, plot style files, font files, linetype definition files, and
blocks on a network location so you don’t have to worry about any users
using outdated files when changes are made. This also gives you control
over who can make changes to these files, as opposed to whether they are
stored locally on each computer. The other advantage of having support files
on the network is that they don’t get lost or forgotten during an upgrade to a
newer release.
Creating a Good Foundation
This book is designed to put you on the right path from the start and to help
you develop good drafting habits when creating objects such as layers, text
styles, and blocks. A solid foundation in anything you do, whether it’s CAD
management or constructing a building, is vital. In AutoCAD, the foundation
that I’m talking about is a drawing template. I cover how to create a new
drawing using one of the drawing templates that comes with AutoCAD in
Book I, Chapter 4, but it’s best to use your own drawing templates.
When creating new drawings, you’ll find that you use the same layers, line-
types, title blocks, and specific styles again and again. As you know, a layer
can be added by using Layer Properties Manager, but adding layers manually
to each new drawing file can be time consuming and can introduce errors.
This is where the concept of drawing template files comes into play. These
files have the DWT file extension and are located by default here:
<drive>:\Users\<user
name>\AppData\Local\Autodesk\<product>\<release>\
<language>\Template
or here for Windows XP users:
<drive>:\Documents and Settings\<user name>\Local Settings\
Application Data\Autodesk\<product>\<release>\<language>\
Template

Creating a Good Foundation
572
If the concept of templates sounds familiar, it’s because applications that are
part of Microsoft Office utilize templates to store formatting and styles that
can be reused when creating a new document.
A drawing template is not much different than the drawing files you create in
AutoCAD. The only difference is that you can provide a description for the
template that appears when you use the StartUp dialog box. And when you
use a drawing template to create a new drawing, AutoCAD creates a new
unnamed drawing with those styles and features and the default name
Drawing1. The numeral at the end of the default name is incremented for
each new drawing that is created while the session of AutoCAD is open.
You use a drawing template file to ensure that the styles and formatting are
ready to go when you need to create a drawing and that styles and format-
ting are consistent among drawings. The most common items included in a
drawing template file are
✦Blocks (Book VI, Chapter 2)
✦Dimension styles (Book III, Chapter 2)
✦Layers (Book I, Chapter 6)
✦Layouts (Book VII, Chapter 1)
✦Linetypes (Book I, Chapter 6)
✦Materials (Book V, Chapter 6)
✦Multileader styles (Book III, Chapter 2)
✦Multiline styles (Book II, Chapter 1)
✦Page setups (Book VII, Chapter 1)
✦Render presets (Book V, Chapter 6)
✦Table styles (Book III, Chapter 1)
✦Text styles (Book III, Chapter 1)
✦UCSs, or User Coordinate System (Book V, Chapter 3)
✦Viewports (Book VII, Chapter 1)
✦Views (Book II, Chapter 3)
✦Visual styles (Book V, Chapter 3)
✦Drawing objects in model and paper space (Book I, Chapter 6)
✦Drawing limits and some drafting settings (Book I, Chapters 6 and 7)
✦System variables (Book I, Chapter 3)

AutoCAD LT does not support the creation or editing of materials used for
rendering 3D objects, multiline styles used to create multiline objects,
render presets for rendering, and visual styles used to stylize 3D objects
without rendering.
Creating a drawing template file
The following steps explain how to create a drawing template file:
1. Create any reusable content in a drawing that you want to have avail-
able when you use the drawing template to create a new drawing.
2. On the menu browser, click File➪Save As.
The Save Drawing As dialog box is displayed.
3. In the Files of Type drop-down list, select AutoCAD Drawing Template
(*.DWT).
AutoCAD automatically navigates to the location of the Template folder. 
I explain how to change the location where AutoCAD looks for drawing
templates under the “Specifying the location of drawing template files”
section later in this chapter.
4. Browse to a different location or use the location specified by
AutoCAD for the drawing template file.
5. In the File Name box for the drawing template, type a file name.
You may want to add some information to the file name to help identify
what the template is used for. For example, you might give your tem-
plate the name E-Size Floor Plan if you’re doing architectural drawings 
or B-size Part if you’re doing mechanical drawings.
6. Click Save.
The Template Description dialog box (see Figure 1-1) is displayed and
allows you to specify a description, the type of measurement to use, and
how new layers are handled.
Figure 1-1:
The
Template
Description
dialog box.

Creating a Good Foundation
574
7. In the Measurement drop-down list, specify the type of measurement.
Optionally enter a description for the template in the Description box
and set how new layers should be handled.
The Measurement option controls which linetype and hatch pattern 
files are used, along with controlling some settings for inserting blocks
into a drawing. The description is displayed in the Create New Drawing
and Startup dialog boxes. The New Layer Notification option controls
whether or not new layers are reconciled when the drawing is saved. 
For more on reconciling layers, see AutoCAD’s online Help system.
8. Click OK.
The Template Description dialog box closes and the drawing template is
saved to the specified location.
The measurement option in the Template Description dialog box controls 
a system variable called MEASUREMENT. This variable can be changed at
any time by typing MEASUREMENT at the command prompt and entering
the new value. Use a value of 0 to specify English (Imperial), or 1 to specify
Metric.
You can also use the LAYEREVALCTL system variable to enable or disable
the reconciling of new layers when saving the drawing. A value of 0 disables
the notification of new layers, and a value of 1 enables the notification
system
Using a drawing template file
After you create a drawing template file, you must understand how to use it
to create a new drawing. Following are some of the common ways to use a
drawing template to create a new drawing:
✦NEW command: Start the NEW command and select the drawing tem-
plate that you want to use.
✦QNEW command: The QNEW command is similar to the NEW command,
with one key difference. You can specify a default drawing template file
that will be used to create a new drawing when the command is used or
each time AutoCAD starts. If no default template file is specified, the
QNEW command behaves like the NEW command. See the “Specifying a
drawing template file for use with QNEW” section to find out how to set
the drawing template to use with the QNEW command.
✦Startup and Create New Drawing dialog boxes: Both the Startup and
Create New Drawing dialog boxes are controlled by the STARTUP system
variable. When STARTUP is set to 1, these dialog boxes are displayed
when AutoCAD first starts or when the NEW command is started. By
default STARTUP is set to a value of 0. See Book I, Chapter 4 to find out
about the Startup and Create New Drawing dialog boxes.

575
✦Double-click a drawing template file: From Windows Explorer, you can
double-click a drawing template file to create a new drawing. If AutoCAD
is not running, it starts, and the new drawing is created.
Specifying a drawing template 
file for use with QNEW
Often, you find yourself using a specific drawing template repeatedly. The
QNEW command was created for just this situation. But out of the box, QNEW
works just like the NEW command because AutoCAD doesn’t know about the
drawing template that you may want to use. To make the QNEW command
achieve its full potential, you need to specify the drawing template to use. This
saves you some time because you don’t have to browse and select the draw-
ing template you commonly use for most of the new drawings you create.
The following steps explain how to specify the drawing template to use with
the QNEW command:
1. Right-click the command line window and choose Options.
The Options dialog box is displayed.
2. Click the Files tab.
The Files tab is used to specify things such as support folders for
AutoCAD to find hatch pattern files, blocks or plotter device informa-
tion.
3. Click the plus sign next to Template Settings to expand it.
The settings related to this group are displayed with additional nodes
(see Figure 1-2).
AutoCAD users see a total of four different template path options,
whereas AutoCAD LT users see only two. The options Drawing Template
File Location and Default Template File Name for QNEW apply to both
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT.
Figure 1-2:
The settings

576
4. Click the plus sign next to Default Template File Name for QNEW.
If no template has been specified, you should see the value None, which
indicates that QNEW is working just like NEW.
5. In the Default Template File Name for QNEW node, select None or the
current value and then click Browse.
The Select a File dialog box is displayed and allows you to select a draw-
ing template file.
6. Specify the drawing template that you want to use when the QNEW
command is used.
The selected drawing template file should be highlighted and the name
placed in the File Name box.
7. Click Open.
The Select a File dialog box closes and the value is added under the
Default Template File Name for QNEW node.
8. In the Options dialog box, click Apply or OK.
Clicking Apply saves the changes made and keeps the dialog box dis-
played, whereas clicking OK saves the changes and closes the Options
dialog box.
Specifying the location of drawing template files
If you create templates for a number of users in your office, you want to be
sure they can access them. Place the drawing templates that you create in a
centralized location and then redirect AutoCAD to them. To specify where
AutoCAD looks for drawing template files, you change a setting in the
Options dialog box.
The following procedure explains how to specify a new location for AutoCAD
to look for drawing template files when the NEW command is started (or at
AutoCAD startup if the Startup dialog box is displayed):
1. Right-click the command line window and choose Options.
The Options dialog box is displayed.
2. Click the Files tab.
3. Click the plus sign next to Template Settings to expand it.
The settings related to this group are displayed with additional nodes.
4. Click the plus sign next to Drawing Template File Location.

5. Select the value under Drawing Template File Location and click
Browse.
The Browse for Folder dialog box is displayed and allows you to select a
new location where AutoCAD looks for drawing template files.
6. In the Browse for Folder dialog box, specify the location AutoCAD
should look for drawing template files.
The location can be on a local or network drive. Most commonly, if
you’re maintaining drawing template files for a group of users, you 
specify a location on the network.
7. Click OK.
The Browse for Folder dialog box closes and the value is added under
the Drawing Template File Location node.
8. In the Options dialog box, click Apply or OK.
Clicking Apply saves the changes and keeps the dialog box displayed,
whereas clicking OK saves the changes and closes the Options dialog box.

A
utoCAD is a robust and complex drafting tool, so not all users discover
or thoroughly understand every feature of the product; one such fre-
quently overlooked feature is the built-in CAD standards tool. This chapter
helps to shine some light on the topic of CAD standards and the built-in tools
that AutoCAD offers to help make the managing of CAD standards easier.
Don’t get discouraged: Developing a good set of CAD standards and getting
them implemented takes some time.
CAD standards can be handled in lots of ways, as you may already know from
your experiences of working at different companies or working with a client’s
set of drawings. Many companies create their own set of CAD standards; others
adopt an industry standard like those defined by an organization such as the
American Institute of Architects (AIA), National CAD Standards, or Construction
Standards Institute (CSI). No matter how your CAD standards came about, they
must be followed to avoid potential problems. If your company doesn’t have
such standards, maybe this is your time to shine by helping to establish them.
CAD Standards Overview
Book VIII, Chapter 1 is a primer of what is involved in establishing CAD stan-
dards. Drawing template files are one of the cornerstones of CAD standards
because they help to promote the use of a company’s standards. However,
drawing templates alone won’t get the job done. Creating and maintaining
CAD standards is something of an art form when you consider everything
you need to understand and appreciate to get drawings to look the way you
want them to.
CAD standards affect both creating and editing geometry. You want to use CAD
standards to make sure that all your drawings have a consistent look when
they are plotted.

CAD Standards Overview
580
As you draw and use established CAD standards, they help to create logical
variations in a drawing — such as different lineweights, linetypes, or even
text styles — that emphasize parts of the design. CAD standards cover a
range of drafting processes from creation to presentation. In most mid- to
large-size companies, CAD standards are determined by a CAD manager; in
smaller companies, a senior-level drafter often takes on the responsibility.
No matter who defines the CAD standards, they must be defined and under-
stood by all drafters.
Following is an overview of some of the important things you should keep in
mind when establishing or modifying a set of CAD standards:
✦Remember plotting: One of the key things to keep in mind when establish-
ing CAD standards is how your drawings will look when they are plotted.
Drawing properties that can affect a drawing when it is plotted are linetype
scale, text size, dimension scale, and lineweights, among others.
✦Don’t make constant changes: I don’t recommend making changes to your
CAD standards on a daily or even weekly basis; otherwise, you really are
defeating the purpose of standards. And, as obvious as it sounds, remember
to keep track of the changes you make. Changes might cause problems for
third-party applications or even possibly your own internal customization.
Tracking changes not only details when changes were made but also offers
a way to communicate the standards to other drafters in the office when
problems arise. Having an implementation date as to when the standards
were updated ensures that everyone stays on the same page.
✦Keep it simple: One thing that can save you time is to create customiza-
tion that incorporates your established CAD standards. If dimensions
should be on a specific layer, consider customizing the user interface so
that the dimension commands set a specific layer current before the
command start. You don’t have to be a power user to set up this type of
customization, and it can cut down on errors and save time.
✦Make it straightforward: CAD standards should not be in the form of com-
plex manuals that require the use of a secret decoder ring to understand
them. CAD standards should make sense not only to your internal drafters
but also to those with whom you share files. If you use cryptic or abbrevi-
ated names for layers and styles, a new person may have a hard time step-
ping in and becoming efficient right away. The length of file names and the
amount of memory were limited in the olden (DOS) days before giga this
and tera that, but now you can be more descriptive with the names you
use for named objects such as layer names and text styles.
Following is a list of the most common named objects and items you should
consider incorporating into your CAD standards:
✦Blocks (Book VI, Chapter 1)
✦Dimension styles (Book III, Chapter 2)

The remainder of this chapter focuses on the CAD standards tools found in
AutoCAD, not AutoCAD LT.
Using AutoCAD’s CAD Standards Tools
AutoCAD provides several different tools that help keep drawings in sync
with defined CAD standards. These tools are
✦Standards Manager: Configures and checks for CAD standard violations.
✦Layer Translator: Configures layer mappings and aligns layers in a draw-
ing to match those defined by your CAD standards.
✦Batch Standards Checker: Checks a set of drawings against a defined
set of CAD standards.
The CAD standards tools provided with AutoCAD help with only a small
subset of the items that are part of a good set of CAD standards. Blocks, lay-
outs, page setups, and table styles, for example, are not part of the CAD stan-
dards tools that come with AutoCAD.
Drawing standards (DWS) files
A drawing standards (DWS) file is, for the most part, the same as a drawing or
drawing template file, except for its file extension and the type of content that
might be saved in it. Here are the most common items found in a drawing
standards file:

Using AutoCAD’s CAD Standards Tools
582
✦Dimension styles (Book III, Chapter 2)
✦Layers (Book I, Chapter 6)
✦Linetypes (Book I, Chapter 6)
✦Text styles (Book III, Chapter 1)
The reason for the limited content of drawing standards files is that these
are the types of objects supported with the built-in CAD standards tools.
The following steps save the current drawing as a drawing standards file:
1. Create a new drawing based on a drawing template or from scratch.
Add any layers, linetypes, dimension styles, or text styles that you
want in the drawing standards file.
2. On the menu browser, choose File➪Save As.
The Save Drawing As dialog box is displayed.
3. In the Files of Type drop-down list, select AutoCAD Drawing
Standards (*.DWS).
4. Browse to a different location or use the location specified by
AutoCAD for saving your drawing standards file.
It’s a good idea to store drawing standards files in a network location so
they can be used by others in the office. If the files are stored locally and
someone else opens the file, he or she may not be able to use the CAD
standards tools because AutoCAD can’t find the drawing standards file.
5. Enter a file name for the drawing standards file.
You may want to name the drawing standards file based on a project
name or the type of drawing with which the drawing standards file will
be used. For example, you might give the drawing standards file the
name Elevations for your elevation drawings, or name the drawing stan-
dards file Project 123 based on the name of a project.
6. Click Save.
The drawing standards file is saved with the specified name and location.
Managing standards
AutoCAD provides a set of tools that allows you to associate a drawing stan-
dards file with a drawing and then check that drawing against the associated
drawing standards files. This set of tools is known as Standards Manager and
is broken up into two parts: The first configures drawing standards files and
associates drawing standards files to a drawing, and the second checks for
violations in the drawing and then fixes them.

Book VIII
Chapter 2
CAD Standards
Using AutoCAD’s CAD Standards Tools
583
When configuring a drawing to use a drawing standards file, you’re specifying
which file should be used to check CAD standards against and which plug-ins
should be used (essentially, a plug-in is a set of rules used to determine whether
the drawing has problems). During the checking of the drawing file, you can fix
any problems the plug-in finds.
Configuring standards
A drawing standards file can be associated with a drawing by using the
STANDARDS command. You can start this command in a number of ways:
✦On the ribbon, click Tools tab➪Standards panel➪Configure.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Tools menu➪CAD
Standards➪Configure.
✦On the CAD Standards toolbar, click the Configure button.
✦At the command prompt type STANDARDS or STA and press Enter.
The following steps explain how to configure a drawing to use a drawing
standards file and specify which standards plug-ins to use:
1. On the ribbon, click Tools tab➪Standards panel➪Configure.
The Configure Standards dialog box (see Figure 2-1) is displayed.
2. Click the Standards tab.
On the Standards tab, you associate the drawing standards files to be
used for the current drawing. If more than one drawing standards file is
specified, the order of the files is important. For example, if more than
one of the associated drawing standards files has the same name for a
layer, the first one encountered from the top of the list is used for vali-
dating the standard.
Figure 2-1:
Configuring

3. Click the + (plus sign) button located in the middle of the dialog box.
The Select Standards File dialog box is displayed. In this dialog box, you
can select which drawing standards files you want to associate with the
drawing. Although more than one drawing standards file can be associ-
ated with a drawing, you can select only one at a time in the Select
Standards File dialog box.
4. Browse to and select the drawing standards file you want to associate
with the drawing.
5. Click Open.
The drawing standards file is added to the list box on the left and some
of the file’s properties are displayed in the list box on the right.
6. Add any additional drawing standards files that you need.
When more than one drawing standards file is associated with a drawing, the
Move Up and Move Down buttons are enabled, allowing you to change 
the order in which the files are used to check for standards violations.
7. Click the Plug-Ins tab.
On the Plug-Ins tab (see Figure 2-2), you can select which plug-ins you
want to use for checking the drawing for violations against the associated
drawing standards files. AutoCAD comes with a total of four plug-ins —
this number hasn’t changed since the feature was introduced.
8. Select the plug-ins that you want to use when checking for standards
violations in the current drawing.
A check mark next to the plug-in means it will be used when checking
standards.

9. Click the Settings button at the bottom of the Configure Standards
dialog box.
The CAD Standards Settings (see Figure 2-3) dialog box is displayed.
10. Make your selections.
In this dialog box, you can control the display of the notification icon
that appears in the status bar when CAD standards are configured and
specify how errors are handled during the process of checking for stan-
dards violations.
11. Click OK.
The drawing standards files are associated with the current drawing and
the dialog box is closed. By default, a book icon (see Figure 2-4) appears
in the status bar, denoting that at least one drawing standards file is
associated with the drawing.
You can right-click some of the notification icons in the status bar trays to
access specific settings for that feature. For example, if you right-click the
book icon used for CAD standards, you can access some of the options for
configuring and checking standards.

Checking standards
After you associate a drawing standards file with a drawing, you can begin to
check for standards violations. You use the CHECKSTANDARDS command
to check CAD standards for a drawing. You can start this command in a
number of ways:
✦On the ribbon, click Tools tab➪Standards panel➪Check.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Tools menu➪CAD
Standards➪Check.
✦On the CAD Standards toolbar, click the Check button.
✦At the command prompt, type CHECKSTANDARDS or CHK and press Enter.
Follow these steps to check a drawing for violations against its associated
drawing standards files and the selected plug-ins:
1. On the ribbon, click Tools tab➪Standards panel➪Check.
The Check Standards dialog box (see Figure 2-5) is displayed. If no stan-
dards file has been associated with the drawing file yet, the Associate
Standards (see Figure 2-6) message box is displayed. If the message box
is displayed, click OK to go to the Configure Standards dialog box.
2. In the Check Standards dialog box, review the standards violations
found in the Problem area.
The Problem area lets you know exactly what violation was detected
during the checking process.
Figure 2-5:
A violation

3. In the Replace With area, select one of the available fixes.
The Replace With area allows you to designate which one of the named
objects in the associated drawing standards files should be used to fix
the problem. When the drawing is compared to the drawing standards
files, AutoCAD attempts to locate a recommended fix, which is desig-
nated with a blue check mark next to. After an item is selected from the
Replace With area, the Preview of Changes area displays an overview of
the changes that will be made.
4. Click Fix to correct the standards violation. If you want to skip a viola-
tion, click Next and no fix will be made. If you also want to skip the
violation the next time the drawing is checked for standards violations,
select Mark This Problem as Ignored.
Clicking Fix updates the properties of the named object in the drawing
to match the drawing standards file after you are through checking for
standards violations.
5. After all violations have been evaluated, the Check Complete message
box is displayed. Click Close to return to the Check Standards dialog box.
The Check Complete message box (see Figure 2-7) displays a summary
of the corrections made or not made.

As you work in a drawing with associated drawing standards files, a notifica-
tion balloon is displayed when a standards violation occurs (see Figure 2-8).
The book icon in the status bar tray also changes to a book with an exclama-
tion point in a yellow triangle. Click the Run Check Standards link in the bal-
loon to display the Check Standards dialog box to fix the violations.
Translating layers
The Configure and Check Standards tools help automate the process of keep-
ing similarly named layers and styles in sync. But what happens if you get a
set of drawings from a client or customer and need to make their drawings
conform to your layers? You don’t want to have to go through each drawing
one by one and map each layer or group of layers to the layer used in your
CAD standards.
This is where Layer Translator comes into play. Layer Translator allows you
to map a single layer or a group of layers to a single layer based on your
established CAD standards. After the translation map for layers is set up,
you can save the layer map to a drawing, drawing standards, or drawing tem-
plate file for use later on additional drawings.
The Layer Translator is accessed through the LAYTRANS command. You can
start this command in several ways:
✦On the ribbon, click Tools tab➪Standards panel➪Layer Translator.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Tools menu➪CAD
Standards➪Layer Translator.
✦On the CAD Standards toolbar, click the Layer Translator button.
✦Type At the command prompt, type LAYTRANS and press Enter.
Follow these steps to create a layer translation map and translate the layers
in a drawing:
1. On the ribbon, click Tools tab➪Standards panel➪Layer Translator.
The Layer Translator dialog box (see Figure 2-9) is displayed.

2. In the Translate To area, click New.
The New Layer dialog box (see Figure 2-10) is displayed.
In the New Layer dialog box, you’re creating a new layer from scratch to
be used in the layer translation process. At minimum, you must specify a
name.
3. Modify the properties as necessary for the new layer and click OK.
The new layer is added to the list in the Translate To area.
4. In the Layer Translator dialog box’s Translate To area, click Load.
The Select Drawing File dialog box is displayed, so you can select a
drawing, drawing standards, or drawing template file to load layers from
for use in the Translate To list.

5. Browse to and select an existing file that contains the layers you want
to use in the layer translation and then click Open.
The layers in the selected file are added to the list in the Translate To area.
6. Click Map Same, which is between the Translate From and Translate
To areas.
Any layers that have the same name between the two lists are mapped.
This helps speed up the process when creating the translations for a
drawing with a larger number of layers.
7. In the Translate From area, select the layer or layers for which you
want to create a layer translation map.
The selected layer or layers become highlighted. You can press and hold
down the Ctrl key to select multiple layers or the Shift key to select a
range of files.
Layers that appear with a white icon next to them in the Translate From
area do not have any objects on them. These layers can be purged from
the list and the drawing by right-clicking them in the list and choosing
Purge Layers.
Use the Selection Filter field to quickly select a number of layer names
that are similar in name. You can use wild-card characters to help create
a complex criterion if needed. For example, you can enter TXT* and
click Select to highlight all the layers that begin with the letters TXT.
8. In the Translate To area, select the layer that you want to map to the
selected layer or layers in the Translate From area.
Layers in both the Translate From and Translate To areas should now be
highlighted.
9. Click Map to create the layer translation.
The layer translation is added to the Layer Translation Mappings area
near the bottom of the dialog box. Each layer that has a translation is
removed from the Translate From list to let you know which ones have
not been mapped yet.
10. Click the Settings button.
The Settings dialog box (see Figure 2-11) is displayed. The default settings
are the best to help maintain good quality CAD standards. The last option
in the Settings dialog box is nice if you’re not sure what is on a layer; when
a layer is selected in the Translate From list, only those layers are dis-
played in the drawing while the Layer Translator dialog box is displayed.

11. In the Settings dialog box, select the desired options and click OK.
The changes to the settings are saved and the Settings dialog box is closed.
12. In the Layer Translator dialog box, click Save.
The Save Layer Mappings dialog box is displayed, allowing you to save
the layer translations that you have created for reuse.
13. In the Save Layer Mappings dialog box, browse to the location where
you want to export the layer translations to, specify a name for the
file, and then click Save.
Use the Files of Type drop-down list to create either a drawing or draw-
ing standards file.
14. In the Layer Translator dialog box, click Translate.
The Layer Translator dialog box closes and the layers are updated based
on the specified layer translations.
Batch checking drawings
Both standards tools discussed up to this point must be set up on an individual
drawing. This isn’t an efficient process if you have hundreds of drawings for a
single project. Wouldn’t it be nice if a utility could check a large number of draw-
ings at once so you wouldn’t have to go through each drawing one by one?
You’re in luck! An external utility called Batch Standards Checker allows you
to take a number of drawings and check them for standards violations. Batch
Standards Checker is similar to the Configure Standards dialog box in how
some of the tabs work. One downside to Batch Standards Checker is that it
doesn’t fix any problems it finds; it only checks for violations, but it’s still
much faster than checking each file individually.

can select multiple drawing and drawing template files.
4. Browse for and select the files that you want to check for standards
violations and then click Open.
The selected files are added to the Drawings to Check list. You can view
some of the properties of the files in the Description area on the right
side of the dialog box. You can change the order in which the files are
processed or remove them from the list by using the buttons in the
middle of the dialog box.
5. (Optional) Select the Check External References of Listed Drawings
option.
When the check box is selected, each external reference in a drawing is
also checked for standards violations.

 Naming files
 Partially loading a drawing
 Controlling what happens during a save operation
 Password-protecting and digitally signing drawings
A
s you may have noticed, drawing files (.dwg) are the main byproduct of
using AutoCAD. They are much more important than the hard copies
or the electronic files generated when plotting. Hard copies of drawings are
designed for presenting a concept or design, but they can’t be modified like
the drawing file can be. For this reason, you need to take care of your drawing
files by storing them in safe locations. You also must ensure that you back them
up and use a logical naming convention so you can easily find the files later.
Many users of AutoCAD don’t fully realize the amount of control they have
over their drawing files. This chapter explains some of the concepts that
you might not know about for working with drawing files. The concepts I
cover here range from file-naming conventions, to password-protecting or
digitally signing drawing files when you share them, to controlling how
objects and layers are indexed to make loading a drawing as an external ref-
erence more efficient.
It’s All in the Name: File-Naming Conventions
Using a naming convention is critical to being able to easily find any docu-
ment, whether it was created with Microsoft Word or AutoCAD. A series of
drawing files named Drawing1, Drawing2, and so on won’t be helpful to you
in the future. Instead, you should come up with a meaningful naming con-
vention that tells you at a glance what project a drawing file pertains to. The
key to creating a good naming convention is to make it meaningful and easy
to understand. If it’s overly complicated, users may wander from the con-
vention and do their own thing, making it harder to find files later.
If you’re in the architectural field, you may want to include such things 
as the project number, building number, drawing type, and drawing size 
in your file name conventions. An example of such a file name might be

Part of a Drawing Can Be a Good Thing: Working with Partial Open
598
A12345-01-P-D.DWG. This type of convention ensures that files related to the
same part of the building and project are grouped together. Of course, good
file organization also helps to make your projects run more efficiently.
AutoCAD comes with a feature called sheet sets. Many users ignore this fea-
ture because they don’t fully understand it. Sheet sets are great for helping
you organize drawings not just by file but also through a structure that
might or might not match the folder structure on a local or network drive. (I
cover sheet sets in Book VII, Chapter 2.) Sheet sets provide not only a way to
organize drawings but also some structure for naming drawings.
AutoCAD 2006 and later releases extend the Windows search feature, which
you can use to find text strings in a drawing file. This can help you find draw-
ing files that might not have been placed in the correct project folder.
Part of a Drawing Can Be a Good Thing: 
Working with Partial Open
Part of a drawing is a good thing? You may be thinking that I might not be
getting enough sleep and therefore have lost my mind. You could be right,
but hear me out before you jump to any conclusions; I’m referring to a fea-
ture called Partial Open, which has been part of the product for the past few
releases. This feature allows you to open part of a drawing file into AutoCAD,
based on a view and selected layers.
AutoCAD LT does not support the Partial Open feature.
Partially opening a drawing file can be a great way to save time versus opening
a large drawing that contains a lot of annotation, hatches, and dimensions.
Instead of waiting for the annotation and geometry to load at the beginning of
the editing process, you can choose not to load that information until you need
to see it. If you happen to need any information in part of the drawing that has
not been loaded, you can specify the area of the drawing that you want those
objects to be displayed in. The key to being able to take full advantage of this
feature is a good set of layer standards and the use of named views. Figure 3-1
shows the same drawing file two ways: The drawing on the left was opened by
using Open, and the one on the right was opened by using Partial Open.
A drawing file can be partially opened by using the OPEN or PARTIALOPEN
command. You can start these commands in one of the following ways:
✦At the command prompt, type PARTIALOPEN and press Enter.
✦Start the OPEN command. In the Select File dialog box, click the drop-
down arrow to the right of the Open button, and choose Partial Open or
Partial Open Read-Only.

Book VIII
Chapter 3
Working with 
Drawing Files
Part of a Drawing Can Be a Good Thing: Working with Partial Open
599
The following procedure explains how to use the Partial Open feature to load
geometry based on a selected view and layers, and how to control the loading
of xrefs when a drawing is being partially opened:
1. On the Quick Access toolbar, click Open.
The Select File dialog box appears.
2. Browse to and select the drawing file you want to partially open. Click
the drop-down arrow next to Open and choose Partial Open.
The Partial Open dialog box (see Figure 3-2) is displayed.
3. In the View Geometry to Load area, select a named view.
By default, two named views are available in every drawing file. These
are *Extents*, which represents the drawing’s extents (the largest area
required to display all objects in a drawing), and *Last*, which repre-
sents the view the drawing was saved with.
4. (Optional) In the Index Status area, select the Use Spatial Index check
box.
Spatial indexing allows for information to be located in a drawing much
faster, although it does increase the file size. See “Indexing the contents
of a drawing” later in this chapter for more information. This option is
available only if either spatial or layer indexing was enabled when the
file was last saved.
5. In the Layer Geometry to Load area, select the layers that contain the
geometry you want to load.
Figure 3-1:
Using Open
versus
Partial
Open.

Part of a Drawing Can Be a Good Thing: Working with Partial Open
600
You don’t need to specify any layers, but if you don’t specify at least
one, AutoCAD prompts you with a message box (see Figure 3-3). Click No
to select some layers before continuing.
6. If the file you are loading contains xrefs, you can select the Unload All
Xrefs on Open option in the lower-left corner.
Selecting this check box unloads all the xrefs attached to the drawing
before it is loaded. The xrefs are not displayed until they’re reloaded
through the External References palette. This is a great feature if you
want to quickly load a drawing that contains a lot of xrefs and then view
only the ones that you’re interested in.
7. Click Open to finish the partial open process.
The drawing is partially opened. You can tell when you’re working in a
partially opened drawing in two ways: The first is that the Partial Load
option is available on the File menu, and the second is that the text
(Partially Loaded) appears after the drawing name in the title bar (see
Figure 3-4).

8. If you need to load additional layers, you can use the Partial Load
option on the File menu.
This displays the Partial Load dialog box (see Figure 3-5), which is simi-
lar to the Partial Open dialog box.
Controlling What Happens during a Save
AutoCAD is a powerful application that contains many features designed 
for specialized uses. Some of these features are not always easy to find or
understand because they’re not in the standard workflow. Some of these
items are the ability to control the default format in which drawing files are
saved in, password protection, digital signatures, and utilizing indexing for
your drawings.

602
Getting a handle on drawing file formats
What is a drawing file format and why is it important? A drawing format is
the structure of how AutoCAD stores information in a drawing file. A format
change occurs when major changes are made to the application to support
new object types and features. AutoCAD has been on a regular schedule of
making a format change about every three releases. By giving you a number
of older drawing file formats to save to, AutoCAD makes it easier for you to
share your drawing files with customers who might be using an older release
than you are. I cover the different drawing file formats and which releases
they belong to in Book I, Chapter 2.
If you need to exchange drawings with users who still use AutoCAD R12 or R13,
you can save your drawings to an R12 DXF file format. By saving to the R12 DXF
file format, some object types are converted to simpler types of objects that
earlier releases understand. Multiline text, for example, is converted to a block
that contains single-line text, and dimensions are no longer associative.
If your company is in the process of upgrading to a newer version, saving
drawings back to a previous file format during the rollout period is often a
good idea so that everyone can access drawings created with the newer
release. This is important because AutoCAD files might not be backward
compatible to the release you are upgrading from. For this reason, Autodesk
introduced a feature to allow you to specify the default file format when the
SAVE, QSAVE, or SAVEAS command is used. You can find this option in the
Options dialog box.
The following steps explain how to set the default file format for saving:
1. Right-click the command line window and choose Options.
The Options dialog box is displayed.
2. Click the Open and Save tab.
The Open and Save tab is used to specify options related to saving and
opening files.
3. In the File Save area, click the drop-down arrow on the drop-down list
below Save As and make a selection.
The drop-down list contains the different DWG, DWT, and DXF file formats
that you can specify as the default file format for saves.
4. Click Apply or OK.
Clicking Apply saves the changes and keeps the Options dialog box
open, whereas clicking OK saves the changes and closes the Options
dialog box.

Indexing the contents of a drawing
Indexing a drawing is not quite the same as filing someone’s name in a
Rolodex or indexing a book, but the results are similar. The reason you 
want to index a drawing is so AutoCAD can find objects easier and faster.
AutoCAD offers two types of indexing: layer indexing and spatial indexing.
Both types of indexing improve the performance of demand loading a draw-
ing. Demand loading is the process used with loading external references
(xrefs) and when partially opening a drawing. When demand loading is used,
AutoCAD loads only the data from the drawing that is required to properly
display the drawing file — objects are loaded as they are required from the
drawing. Layer indexing improves the loading of objects on layers that are on
and thawed. Objects on a layer that is frozen or off are not read in with the
drawing file. Those layers are read in only when specifically requested.
Spatial indexing is used to organize objects in 3D space and improves the
loading performance of a referenced file that has been clipped. Clipping a ref-
erenced file allows you to define which part of a referenced file is displayed in
the drawing by defining the area to be displayed by using a rectangular or
polygonal boundary. (Clipping referenced files is covered more in Book VI,
Chapter 3.) Both layer and spatial indexing are helpful only if the file is being
used as an xref or is being partially opened. If indexing is enabled, saving the
drawing file takes slightly longer. Indexing is available in four options:
✦None: Indexing is disabled.
✦Layer: Only layer indexing is enabled.
✦Spatial: Only spatial indexing is enabled.
✦Layer & Spatial: Layer and spatial indexing are enabled.
The following steps explain how to set the indexing type when saving a
drawing file:
1. On the menu browser, choose File menu➪Save As.
The Save Drawing As dialog box is displayed.
2. Choose Tools➪Options.
The Saveas Options dialog box (see Figure 3-6) is displayed. It contains
some different options for both DWG and DXF file formats.
3. In the Index Type drop-down list, click the down arrow.
The drop-down list displays the various indexing options you can use.
4. Select an option in the drop-down list.

Protecting Your Drawings
604
5. Click OK.
The Saveas Options dialog box closes and you return to the Save
Drawing As dialog box.
6. Specify the file name and location for the drawing you’re saving and
then click Save.
The Save Drawing As dialog box closes and the drawing is saved with
the indexing type specified.
In AutoCAD LT, you must use the INDEXCTL system variable to specify the type
of indexing that should be used when saving a drawing. A value of 0 indicates
indexing is disabled, 1 indicates only layer indexing is enabled, 2 indicates only
spatial indexing is enabled, and 3 indicates both layer and spatial indexing are
enabled. You can use the INDEXCTL system variable with AutoCAD as well. To
set the indexing to use with INDEXCTL, enter the variable name and value at
the command prompt and then save the drawing file.
Protecting Your Drawings
You work hard to create the perfect design, so you have every right to make
sure that it’s kept safe. AutoCAD offers two options to make sure that your
design doesn’t get altered without your permission: password protection
and digital signatures. Password protection locks the file and doesn’t allow
anyone to view it without first entering a password. Digital signatures aren’t
as secure as password-protected files, but they do offer a level of protection
by indicating whether the file was altered after it was signed. This can be
critical when you need to have a client sign off on a design.
AutoCAD LT does not support the ability to password-protect drawing files.
Password-protecting
Password-protecting a drawing file in AutoCAD is similar to password-
protecting a file in other applications: You provide a password or phrase 
Figure 3-6:
Drawing file
options.

Book VIII
Chapter 3
Working with 
Drawing Files
Protecting Your Drawings
605
and specify the type of encryption you want to use. Although password 
protection offers benefits, it also has a downside.
If you use password protection, you must record the password in a safe
place so that you don’t forget it; otherwise, you won’t be able to open the
file. No amount of magic can unlock the file after the password has been lost,
so you may want to make a backup copy of the drawing file without the pass-
word before you save it with one.
I also recommend that you talk to your CAD manager or a senior-level
drafter before you start using password protection on drawing files. After all,
the drawing file does belong to the company or client and not to you.
Assigning a password to a drawing file
The following steps explain how to password-protect a drawing file:
1. On the menu browser, click File menu➪Save As.
The Save Drawing As dialog box is displayed.
2. Choose Tools➪Security Options.
The Security Options dialog box, which contains the options for working
with passwords and digital signatures (see Figure 3-7), is displayed.
3. In the Password or Phrase to Open This Drawing box, type the pass-
word or phrase.
The value that you enter is masked in the box as you enter it.
4. (Optional) Select the Encrypt Drawing Properties option.
Drawing properties provide information through Windows Explorer
about a drawing file, such as author, title, and custom properties. Figure
Figure 3-7:

Protecting Your Drawings
606
3-8 shows what the Properties dialog box looks like in Windows Explorer
when it is not encrypted through the use of password protection (on the
left) and when it is encrypted (on the right). The left image shows that
three additional tabs (Summary, Statistics, and Custom) are displayed
when the drawing file is not password-protected.
5. (Optional) In the Security Options dialog box, click Advanced Options.
The Advanced Options dialog box (see Figure 3-9) is displayed. Select
the encryption provider that you want to use and the key length. The
key length determines the overall length of the encryption key. The higher
the value, the greater the level of security your drawing will have. Based
on your operating system and what country you’re in, your encryption
options may vary. I recommend using the greatest key length possible for
the encryption provider you select — in most cases, the value is 128. After
all, you want to be sure that your data is protected. When you finish, click
OK to accept the changes.
6. In the Security Options dialog box, click OK.
The Confirm Password dialog box (see Figure 3-10) is displayed. It warns
you of the dangers of forgetting or losing your password, which I men-
tion earlier in this chapter.

7. Reenter the password in the Reenter Password to Open This Drawing
text field and then click OK.
If the passwords match, both the Confirm Password and Security
Options dialog boxes close, and you return to the Save Drawing As
dialog box.
8. Finish specifying the file name and location for the drawing you’re
saving and click Save.
The Save Drawing As dialog box closes and the drawing is saved with
the specified password.
If you remove the value from the Password or Phrase to Open This Drawing
box (refer to Step 3), the password protection from the drawing file is removed.
Working with a password-protected drawing
Password protection goes beyond just needing to enter a password to open
a drawing file. Password protection affects any operation that reads the con-
tents of the drawing file into another drawing, such as opening the drawing
file, referencing the drawing file externally, or inserting the drawing file into
another drawing.
Follow these steps to open a drawing that has been saved with a password:
1. On the Quick Access toolbar, click Open.
The Select File dialog box is displayed.
2. Browse to and select the drawing file you want to open.
3. Click Open.
The Select File dialog box closes and the Password dialog box is dis-
played (see Figure 3-11).
Figure 3-10:
Confirming
your

Protecting Your Drawings
608
4. In the Password dialog box, enter the password and click OK.
If you entered the correct password, the drawing file should finish load-
ing. If not, an error message is displayed asking you to retry or to cancel
the operation. The password is cached in memory, so if you close the
drawing and reopen it without restarting AutoCAD, you won’t need to
reenter the password.
Digital signatures
Unlike password protection, digital signatures don’t keep anyone from view-
ing the contents of a file. Instead, they notify the person viewing the file
whether a change has been made after it was signed. Digital signatures
require a little more work to use the first time because you must first obtain
a digital ID.
You have to obtain a digital ID from a company such as VeriSign
(www.verisign.com) or IdenTrust (www.digsigtrust.com). After you obtain a
digital ID, you can start signing drawing files. Digital IDs can be used with
other applications besides AutoCAD; some programs such as Outlook also
support digital IDs for signing e-mails. Some companies offer trial periods for
testing the use of a digital ID and then require a small annual fee to keep the
digital ID valid beyond the trial period.
Obtaining a digital signature from VeriSign
Autodesk has wired AutoCAD to take you to VeriSign’s Web site to obtain a
digital signature for signing drawing files, so I thought I would follow Autodesk’s
recommendation. The following steps are an overview of how to obtain a digi-
tal signature from VeriSign, but feel free to use a different vendor if you want.
The steps will vary from vendor to vendor. If you don’t have a digital ID yet, the
Valid Digital ID Not Available dialog box is displayed (see Figure 3-12).

Removing the security option for 
password-protecting a drawing file
Some companies worry that employees might
abuse the capability to password-protect draw-
ing files. This is one reason why Autodesk allows
the CAD manager or Information Technology (IT)
department to remove the feature during instal-
lation. The option can be disabled when Custom
is selected on the Select the Installation Type
screen during the installation process. If Typical
was selected during installation, you can
remove the password-protect feature through
the Programs and Features option on Windows
Vista or the Add and Remove Programs on
Windows XP in the Windows Control Panel. The
figure shows the Drawing Encryption option that
controls whether the password protection fea-
ture is available. Disabling this feature only pre-
vents people from password-protecting a
drawing file and has no affect on their ability to
receive and open drawings that are password-
protected by others.

6. In the Get Time Stamp From drop-down list, you can specify a time
stamp, which I recommend doing.
The time stamp helps to validate the digital signature.
7. (Optional) In the Comment area, you can add comments for the indi-
vidual who will be opening or viewing the file.
For example, you may want to add a comment about whether the file has
been approved for manufacturing.

Opening a digitally signed drawing file
Digitally signed drawings serve a different purpose than a drawing you might
be creating or editing. This is why they are displayed in a slightly different
way in Windows Explorer. The icon for a digitally signed drawing file includes
two red and yellow marks (okay, I know you can only see them in black and
white in this book) in the center or upper-right corner (see Figure 3-16).
The following steps explain how to open a drawing that has been saved with
a digital signature:
1. On the Quick Access toolbar, click Open.
The Select File dialog box is displayed.
2. Browse to and select the file you want to open.
The selected file should be highlighted in the dialog box and its name
displayed in the File Name box.
3. Click Open.
The Select File dialog box closes and the Digital Signature Contents
dialog box is displayed (see Figure 3-17).

4. Review the information to make sure that everything is correct, and
then click Close.
The Validate Digital Signatures icon is displayed in the status bar. If the
digital signature is invalid, you see a warning notification at the top of
the Digital Signature Contents dialog box (see Figure 3-18).
You can control the display of the Digital Signature Contents dialog box with
the SIGWARN system variable. Enter SIGWARN at the command prompt to
change its current value. A value of 0 suppresses the display of the dialog box
unless the digital signature is invalid. A value of 1 displays the dialog box. (This
is the default behavior.)
Digitally signing a batch of drawings
If you have a large set of drawing files that need to be digitally signed all at
once, Autodesk offers an external utility to do so. This utility is properly
named Attach Digital Signatures. It’s pretty basic and easy to understand.
The following steps explain how to access and digitally sign multiple drawing
files at one time:

rawing files are one of the byproducts of AutoCAD. When you work
with AutoCAD you have two choices: to keep a design digital or create
a physical hard copy of the drawing. The electronic drawing is much more
important than the hard copy of a drawing that can be produced with the
PLOT or PUBLISH commands. To efficiently deliver a set of drawings to a
client or someone else, drawings should remain digital. This doesn’t mean
that a hard copy of the drawing file isn’t important; it’s just that it’s a slower
way to deliver and communicate changes.
This chapter focuses on delivering a representation of a drawing file in a digital
format that can’t be modified — well, the original drawing isn’t affected anyway.
Sharing drawing files can be challenging; others want your drawing files, but
they may not be able to view or use them with their software application of
choice. AutoCAD offers a few solutions to help you share drawing files with
people who don’t own a CAD program or people who do own a CAD program
but use something other than AutoCAD.
AutoCAD also offers a variety of options for accessing FTP sites, project
management sites developed by Autodesk to work with their products such
as Buzzsaw and Streamline, and publishing drawing files to Web sites.
Sharing Drawings with Non-AutoCAD-based Products
When you work with CAD, you often need to share your drawing files with
others. However, not everyone’s CAD application is the same. For this reason,
CAD applications must be able to communicate in other file formats. AutoCAD
provides various output file formats so that it can more easily exchange
drawing files with other programs. You may be familiar with some of these 
file formats, but not others.

Taking Drawings to the Internet
618
You use four primary commands to export to a different file type: SAVEAS,
EXPORT, PLOT, 3DDWF and PUBLISH. Other commands, such as BMPOUT,
PNGOUT, JPGOUT, and TIFOUT, are available for exporting objects in a draw-
ing to a raster image file. Here is a list of the file formats that you can export
out of AutoCAD.
✦DXF: Drawing Interchange Format
✦WMF: Microsoft Windows Metafile
✦ACIS: ACIS solid object file
✦STL: Solid object stereolithography file
✦EPS: Encapsulated Postscript file
✦DXX: Attribute extract DXF file
✦BMP: Windows Bitmap file
✦JPG: JPEG graphic file
✦PNG. Portable Network Graphics file
✦TIF: Tag Image File Format
✦3D DWF: 3D Autodesk Design Web Format
✦3D DWFx: 3D Autodesk Design Web Format
✦DWF: Design Web Format
✦DWFx: Design Web Format (XPS Compliant)
✦DGN (V7): MicroStation V7 Design file
✦DGN (V8): MicroStation V8 Design file
✦PDF: Adobe Acrobat Portable Document File
✦PLT: AutoCAD Plot file
AutoCAD LT does not support the ACIS, STL, EPS, DXX, 3D DWF, or 3D DWFx
file formats.
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT now support the ability to export MicroStation V7
Design files and DWFx Design Web Format files that are XPS compliant. 3D
DWFx files can be created only with AutoCAD.
Taking Drawings to the Internet
AutoCAD can and does play a role in being able to connect to the Internet to
access drawings that have been posted for you to reference, or to be able to
push content to a Web site. All of AutoCAD’s primary file access commands

are capable of utilizing FTP — File Transfer Protocol. This allows you to
access and place files on a remote server that could be just around the block
or halfway around the world. For the most part, the use of FTP is transparent
to you because it’s integrated into AutoCAD.
Along with using FTP, Autodesk offers two project collaboration sites that users
of their products can sign up to use for a fee. The project collaboration sites
are similar to FTP sites and how they are integrated into AutoCAD and other
Autodesk products, but they offer much more than just a place to park drawing
files. These sites allow for history tracking when files change, embedded file
viewers, permissions-based access, and a built-in notification system, to just
name a few of the features that the sites offer.
Project collaboration sites are great, but sometimes they are based on the
type of information you need to share across the Internet. Autodesk does
offer publishing tools that can take a set of drawing files and publish them to
Web-friendly formats, such as DWFx, DWF, JPG, and PNG. This feature is
basic in its abilities, but if you are not familiar with Web page design, it’s
great for putting together a nice little interface for your clients use to access
drawings and information.
Using an FTP site
Working with an FTP site from AutoCAD is similar to accessing an FTP site
through Internet Explorer. Both require the location, a user name, and a pass-
word. The only difference is that you can open and save to the FTP site right
from AutoCAD instead of downloading the files first and then re-uploading
them later.
Virtually every file navigation dialog box inside AutoCAD can access an FTP
site. One of the nice features of using FTP with AutoCAD is that you can con-
figure an FTP site as a reusable location. So if you happen to be working on a
project over a period of time, you won’t have to worry about forgetting the
address, user name, or password. Instead, you just need to set up the FTP
site once and it is there until you remove it.
The following steps explain how to configure and use an FTP location from
inside AutoCAD:
1. On the Quick Access toolbar, click Open.
The Select File dialog box appears.
2. Choose Tools➪Add/Modify FTP Locations.
The Add/Modify FTP Locations dialog box appears (see Figure 4-1).

Taking Drawings to the Internet
620
3. In the Name of FTP Site box, enter a name for the location.
Even though the box is called Name of FTP Site, you enter the URL (uni-
form resource location) for the FTP location. A sample URL is ftp.web-
sitename.com/drawings.
4. In the Log On As area, select the logon type.
If you specify User, you must enter the user name that has been set up
for you to access the FTP site. If no user name was set up and the site is
open to the general public, you can use Anonymous.
5. In the Password box, type the password associated with the user
name, if one exists.
As the password is entered, it is automatically masked (the keys pressed
do not appear on-screen).
6. Click the Add button.
An entry for the FTP location is added to the list box at the bottom of
the dialog box. You can later select the FTP location from the list box
and click Modify or Remove to make changes to it.
7. Click OK.
The Add/Modify FTP Location dialog box closes and you return to the
Select File dialog box.
8. In the shortcuts pane on the left side, click FTP.
The Select File dialog box updates and displays an FTP Locations item
that contains the FTP locations that have been defined.

9. Browse to the file you want to open just as if it was on your local or
network drive, and click Open.
The Select File dialog box closes and the drawing is opened. Do not
forget that you can access the FTP location from most file navigation
dialog boxes in AutoCAD.
Autodesk i-drop
Autodesk i-drop is a technology that allows for
content to be dragged and dropped from a Web
page into AutoCAD. There are two parts to i-
drop. One part is used on a Web page to indi-
cate where the content is stored and which part
of the Web page should be clicked to access
the content. The second part is built into
AutoCAD and picks up when content from an i-
drop–enabled Web page is dropped into the
drawing window. The AutoCAD side downloads
the content to the local drive. The downloaded
content usually contains a drawing file that is to
be inserted as a block but can also contain
things such as company spec guides or mar-
keting material. The figure shows an image of
the DC Online tab of DesignCenter; this tab uti-
lizes i-drop technology.
To use an i-drop–enabled image such as the
ones found in DesignCenter, you place the cursor
over the image. If the image supports i-drop, an
eyedropper icon appears. Click and hold down
the mouse button over the image, and then drag
and drop the content over the drawing window.

Taking Drawings to the Internet
622
Publishing drawings to the Web
One of the great things about AutoCAD is its robust set of features that does
not just focus on drafting-based features but contains tools for presenting
design concepts across the Internet. One of these presentation tools helps to
deliver drawing files to the Web through a wizard. This wizard allows you to
specify some basic Web template designs, the visual output for the drawing
files specified, and different layouts in drawing files. Autodesk calls this feature
Publish to Web.
The Publish to Web feature is not meant to be one-size-fits-all; it is designed
for people unfamiliar with HTML and Web page design. If you’re familiar with
HTML and creating Web pages, you may find that the implementation is lim-
iting. However, if you don’t know how to create Web pages, you may find
Publish to Web purely magical. The feature offers some nice capabilities for
dragging and dropping drawing files from a Web page with the use of i-drop,
along with the ability to quickly modify a Web page. See the sidebar,
“Autodesk i-drop,” for information on i-drop.
Drawing files can be published to Web pages by using the PUBLISHTOWEB
command. You can start this command in a number of ways:
✦On the ribbon, click Output tab➪Publish panel➪Publish to Web.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click File menu➪Publish to Web.
✦At the command prompt type PUBLISHTOWEB or PTW and press Enter.
Follow these steps to create a simple Publish to Web project:
1. Save the current drawing before continuing.
The Publish to Web feature can’t be used on drawings that aren’t first
saved.
2. On the ribbon, click Output tab➪Publish panel➪Publish to Web.
The Publish to Web dialog box appears (see Figure 4-2).
3. Select Create New Web Page and click Next.
The option is pretty self-explanatory. If you select Edit Existing Web
Page, you’re prompted to select an existing file with the PTW extension
that was previously created with the Publish to Web Wizard. After you
specify the file, you can edit the page’s title and description.
4. On the Create Web Page page, enter the name of the Web page you’re
creating, the location where you want the file created, and a descrip-
tion to display with the Web page. Click Next.
You can use the Create Web Page page to specify basic configuration
information (see Figure 4-3).

5. On the Select Image Type page, specify the type of image to create
and its size. Click Next.
The Select Image Type page is used to specify the output format for the
drawing layouts when they are published. You can choose from four
image types: DWFx, DWF, JPEG, and PNG. The image size is available
when you specify JPEG and PNG. You can choose from four sizes: Small,
Medium, Large, and Extra Large.
6. On the Select Template page, select the template for the desired
layout in the Templates list box. Click Next.
The Select Template page is used to specify the basic layout of the
images and text on the Web page when the final output is published (see
Figure 4-4). You can choose from four templates: Array of Thumbnails,
Array plus Summary, List of Drawings, and List plus Summary.
7. On the Apply Theme page, specify the color theme for the Web page
by selecting it in the drop-down list. Click Next.

The Apply Theme page is used to add some color to the Web page. If you
know HTML, you can change the colors later beyond the seven themes
that AutoCAD provides.
8. On the Enable i-drop page, specify whether i-drop should be enabled
on the Web page. Click Next.
The Enable i-drop page is used to enable i-drop for the thumbnails gen-
erated during the publish process. This allows users of the Web page to
drag and drop associated drawing files from the Web page into the draw-
ing window.
9. On the Select Drawings page, specify the layouts from the current
drawing file or select a different file. Each layout can have its own
label and description. Click Add after you have specified a layout and
its label and description.
The Select Drawings page is used to specify the layouts you want to add to
the final published Web page (see Figure 4-5). You work with one drawing at
a time and add each layout that you want to the drawing set to be processed.
Each layout added to the Web page is displayed in the Image list.
10. Click Next when you finish adding different layouts.
There’s no limit to the number of layouts that can be specified.
11. On the Generate Images page, specify which files should be regener-
ated: only those files that have been changed or all drawing files.
Click Next.
The Generate Images page gives you some control over how long the
republishing of a Web page will take. Based on the number of layouts
and the size of drawing files, you may want to regenerate the output
only for changed drawing files. AutoCAD starts processing the images
for output.

Using Web-based project sites
As the Internet becomes more content enriched and users become more
accustomed to using it, software companies are expanding its possibilities
for business use. Some software companies, such as Autodesk, are building
project-based collaboration sites that allow their customers to share and
post drawing files for members of project teams to access.
Autodesk Buzzsaw is a project collaboration site designed around the AEC
community (see Figure 4-7). There’s even a quick way to access Autodesk
Buzzsaw from the file navigation dialog boxes in AutoCAD for opening or
saving a drawing file. The project site allows you to define who is part of a
project and what type of rights they have. The site is used for placing not
just drawing files but any kind of file that might be used to complete a proj-
ect. The site works similarly to that of a standard file browser application
except it has built-in revision tracking and allows you to view files. You can
get a free 30-day trial of Autodesk Buzzsaw by visiting
www.autodesk.com/buzzsaw/.
Autodesk Buzzsaw has a sister (or brother) site called Autodesk Streamline
that’s targeted at manufacturers rather than the AEC community. You can
use Autodesk Buzzsaw for any type of project, but Autodesk Streamline is
optimized to work with the supply chain and suppliers. You can get a free 30-
day trial of Autodesk Streamline by visiting www.autodesk.com/streamline/.

The following steps demonstrate how to create a shortcut to a project on
Autodesk Buzzsaw and then open a drawing from the site. To complete the
steps, a project site has to be created first on Autodesk Buzzsaw.
1. On the Quick Access toolbar, click Open.
The Select File dialog box appears.
2. In the Places list on the left side, click Buzzsaw.
The Site list box in the center of the dialog box displays a listing of the
project site shortcuts that have already been created. You can use one
of these shortcuts if the project site you want to access is listed.
3. In the list, double-click Add a Buzzsaw Location Shortcut.
The Log In to Buzzsaw Site dialog box appears (see Figure 4-8).
4. In the Buzzsaw Site box, enter the URL to the project site. Then in the
Buzzsaw User Name and Password boxes, enter your assigned user
name and password.
The login information can be retained by selecting the Save Login Name
and Password check box.
5. Click OK.
The Create a Buzzsaw Location Shortcut dialog box appears (see Figure 4-9).
6. Under the project site that you entered in Step 4, specify a folder that
you want to use for the shortcut. Also enter a name for the shortcut as
you want it to appear in the Site list box after it is created. Click OK.
If you’re not sure of the path to the project folder, click the Browse
button and a dialog box with a tree view appears so that you can select a
folder (see Figure 4-10). After you click OK in the Create a Buzzsaw
Location Shortcut dialog box, you return to the Select File dialog box.

Emulating Paper Digitally
The concept of our society using less and less paper when the Internet was
born was a great vision, but it’s almost a decade since the Internet went
mainstream and the shift has yet to happen. The design industry is making
the shift to relying more on electronic file sharing than producing hard
copies, but a fair amount of paper is still being used.
Paper drawing sets have the following costs:
✦Paper: Paper doesn’t simply grow on trees; well, in a way it does, but it
costs money to print drawing files on any size of paper.

✦Delivery: Someone has to deliver your printed drawing files to your
client, and that usually leads to paying a delivery service. This cost can
quickly grow based on the number of drawing sets sent, how much they
weigh, and how quickly they need to be delivered.
✦Time: You have to wait for the set of drawings to be delivered by a deliv-
ery service to your client’s doorstep, and then you have to wait for the
drawings to be marked up and returned.
✦Hardware maintenance: The more you plot out to hard copy, the more
frequently your plotters and printers will need to be serviced. This can
cause downtime and increase the cost of ownership to keep the hard-
ware going.
Going completely electronic isn’t the answer either, but based on the phase
and size of the project, you may find that speed of delivery and lower costs
are nicely associated with using electronic files. Two common electronic file
formats are often used to share drawing files: Design Web Format (DWF and
DWFx) and Portable Document Format (PDF).
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT now support the creation of 2D and 3D DWFx files.
DWFx is a new version of DWF that is designed for use with Microsoft’s XPS
Viewer, which comes with Windows Vista and can be installed on a computer
running Windows XP. So users of Windows Vista do not require a special
viewer to view DWFx files. The DWFx files that can be viewed with the XPS
Viewer are limited to 2D geometry only. AutoCAD LT can produce only 2D
DWFx files.
Design Web Format (DWF and DWFx)
DWF and DWFx are Autodesk’s solutions to a paperless representation of a
drawing file or a set of drawing files in a file format that is secure and small
enough to be easily e-mailed. A DWF or DWFx file doesn’t include all the
object properties that are in a drawing file — just enough information to dis-
play the drawing accurately on-screen. DWF and DWFx files, like DWG files,
are vector-based files rather than raster files. This allows for them to be
loaded faster and allows you to manipulate certain aspects of the file as if
you were viewing the original drawing file.
DWF and DWFx files have grown in popularity over recent years with more
AutoCAD users using them with their clients. Autodesk has been increasing
the efficiency and features that DWF and DWFx support in recent releases.
DWF files started with support for only 2D objects in a single-sheet file, but
now the DWF file format supports 2D and 3D objects, metadata, realtime
shading and viewing, and multisheet support.
Most of the products that Autodesk develops for the design community can
produce DWF and DWFx files with commands such as PLOT and PUBLISH or

Emulating Paper Digitally
630
a system printer such as the Autodesk DWF Writer, which can be used to print
a Word document to a DWF file or any other document that can be printed.
A few releases back, Autodesk had two DWF file viewers: Autodesk DWF Viewer,
which was free, and Autodesk DWF Composer, which cost around $100 to $200.
Autodesk now offers a single viewer that replaces both Autodesk DWF Viewer
and Autodesk DWF Composer. The newest DWF viewer, Autodesk Design
Review, is free. It allows you to view, mark up, and print DWF and DWFx files.
If a client is running Windows Vista, you can exchange 2D DWFx files with
them, and they can use the preinstalled XPS Viewer to view the file with lim-

Portable Document File (PDF)
PDF is Adobe’s solution to a paperless representation of a drawing file or any
other document that can be printed. A number of PDF drivers are on the
market, so when I refer to PDF, I’m referring to it as a file format. Some of the
drivers don’t take advantage of all the features equally. If you want to take
full advantage of the file format, use an application such as Acrobat
Professional from Adobe. A PDF file can be viewed by using a free viewer
from Adobe called Adobe Acrobat Reader.
Unlike DWF or DWFx, PDF is a much more widely used file format because it
has been around longer and is more commonly used for nonengineering-type
file formats, such as Word documents and spreadsheets. Over recent years,
PDF has gone through some transformations to help improve the type of
data that can be stored in the files, so it is much more useful to the design
community. PDF files offer security options in the form of password protec-
tion and digital signatures.
The ability to produce a PDF file from AutoCAD out of the box has been on
the wish list for many years now. AutoCAD 2009 comes with its own plotting
device to output to a PDF file format. This driver is called DWG to PDF.pc3
and is available through the PLOT or PUBLISH command.
Head-to-head comparison
DWF, DWFx, and PDF files have their places in the design community; it just
depends on your needs and who you are working with. The file format that
you choose to use comes down to what the client wants in most cases.
Following is a comparison between the three file formats.
✦Sharing: DWF or DWFx files are much smaller than PDF files, which is
partly because of the optimization of the viewer engine. DWF or DWFx
was originally designed for design data and PDF was designed for Word
documents. However, most clients likely have Adobe Acrobat Reader on
their computer versus Autodesk Design Review used to view DWF and
DWFx files.

✦Efficiency: DWF, DWFx, and PDF files can be created in AutoCAD without
the need to download and install additional software.
✦Viewing: Both Autodesk Design Review and Adobe Acrobat Reader sup-
port panning and zooming of a file, but Autodesk supports a much wider
range of resolutions. This allows you to zoom in on a small area of a
DWF or DWFx file and have it still look crisp and clear. All three file for-
mats support 3D objects, but DWF and DWFx display 3D geometry
better. If you want to create a 3D PDF, though, you need to purchase an
additional program from Adobe.
✦Printing: All three file formats can be printed by using both standard
and large paper formats.
✦Markups: Autodesk Design Review and Adobe Acrobat Reader support
marking up files, but the process is smoother between DWF or DWFx
and AutoCAD because of the integrated tools. If you need to do markups,
Autodesk Design Review costs less (because it is free) than Adobe
Acrobat (not to be confused with Adobe Acrobat Reader, which is free).
✦Speed: It takes less time to create a DWF or DWFx file from a drawing file
when compared to a PDF file. This is due to the way the files are generated.
✦Compatibility: Each version of AutoCAD, starting with AutoCAD 2000,
has shipped with the ability to create DWF files. AutoCAD 2007 was the
first to support PDF, and AutoCAD 2009 is the first to support DWFx. So
if you have other releases of AutoCAD in your office, you may need to
obtain a PDF print driver from Adobe or a third-party provider or set up
a separate computer for just plotting to PDF and DWFx files. Some third-
party utilities and even Adobe Acrobat might not always support the
latest version of AutoCAD, so it’s nice to have a PDF driver that ships
with AutoCAD.
✦Security: DWF, DWFx, and PDF files support password protection, but
PDF goes beyond that with support for digital signatures.
Working with DWF and DWFx Files
Creating a DWF or DWFx file by using the PLOT or PUBLISH command is
straightforward, but what happens after the file has been created? After you
create the file, you can share it, and based on those you are sharing it with,
they will need a viewer. Autodesk offers a DWF viewer called Autodesk
Design Review that allows you to view and print a DWF or DWFx file as well
as merge DWF files, mark up files, and perform measurements from point to
point. You can download Autodesk Design Review from Autodesk’s Web site
by going to www.autodesk.com/designreview/.

Creating a DWF or DWFx file
Autodesk provides a number of ways for you to create a DWF or DWFx file,
whether you’re using AutoCAD or one of the many Autodesk products. From
inside AutoCAD, you can use the PLOT and PUBLISH commands to create a
DWF or DWFx file. The following steps create a DWF file with the PLOT
command:
1. On the ribbon, click Output tab➪Plot panel➪Plot.
The Plot dialog box is displayed.
2. In the Printer/Plotter drop-down list, choose DWF6 ePlot.pc3.
The DWF6 ePlot.pc3 plot device becomes active. Use the DWFx ePlot
(XPS Compatible).pc3 plot device to create a DWFx file.
3. Click the Properties button just to the right of the Printer/Plotter
drop-down list.
The Plotter Configuration Editor — DWF6 ePlot.pc3 dialog box appears.
From here, you can access various properties for the device.
4. In the tree view, select Custom Properties. In the Access Custom
Dialog area, click Custom Properties.
The DWF6 ePlot Properties dialog box appears (see Figure 4-11). In this
dialog box, you can specify various options related to creating a DWF
file. Properties range from embedding fonts to whether layer names and
on/off states are saved with the DWF or DWFx file.

5. Specify the options as necessary. Click OK twice to return to the Plot
dialog box.
The changes are saved, and the DWF ePlot Properties and Plotter
Configuration Editor — DWF6 ePlot.pc3 dialog boxes are closed.
6. In the Plot dialog box, specify the necessary options for the plot and
then click OK.
The Browse for Plot File dialog box appears, allowing you to specify the
name of the DWF file that will be created and the location where you
want to create it.
7. Enter the name for the file and where you want to save it, and then
click Save.
The DWF file is created in the specified location with the name that you
entered. After the plot is created, a notification balloon appears to inform
you that the Plot and Publish job has completed (see Figure 4-12). You
can right-click over the Plot/Publish icon and select View DWF File to
view the DWF file.
Viewing a DWF or DWFx file
Autodesk Design Review is not designed for engineers or individuals who
already know AutoCAD, but for someone who is familiar with browsing the
Internet and creating word processing documents.
DWF and DWFx files can be viewed in a variety of ways. Here are a few:
✦Embedded in a document: DWF and DWfx files can be embedded in a
Microsoft Word document or even a PowerPoint presentation file.
✦Viewed from a browser: DWF and DWFx files can be placed online on a
Web page to allow for direct viewing and interaction.
✦Standalone file viewing: Autodesk Design Review supports the ability to
open a file directly from a local, network, or remote file location. The file
is not embedded in a document or part of a Web page. You can launch
the viewer to view a DWF or DWFx file by double-clicking the file in
Windows Explorer.

Working with DWF and DWFx Files
634
The following steps use Autodesk Design Review to open a DWF or DWFx file:
1. Choose Start (Windows button)➪[All] Programs➪Autodesk➪Autodesk
Design Review.
Autodesk Design Review is launched and by default displays the Getting
Started page.
2. On the menu bar, choose File➪Open.
The Open File dialog box appears.
3. Browse to and select the DWF or DWFx file you want to open. Click
Open.
The selected file opens in Autodesk Design Review. After the file opens,
you can pan and zoom around in the file and view the drawing proper-
ties published with the file.
Electronically marking up a DWF or DWFx file
You can use DWF and DWFx files with Autodesk Design Review to communi-
cate changes, or revisions, to a drafter. Autodesk Design Review contains a
number of markup and commenting tools that range from creating a simple
line to much more complex tools that allow for the creation of revision
clouds around areas in the file. As markup and commenting objects are
added, Autodesk Design Review records who added them and when they
were added to the DWF or DWFx file.
After the markups and comments have been added to the DWF or DWFx file
by using Autodesk Design Review, you can send them back to a drafter to
make the necessary changes or plot them off with the viewer. If the DWF or
DWFx file with markups is sent back to a drafter who has access to the origi-
nal drawing file, the markups can be imported into AutoCAD and overlaid
over the objects in the drawing by using Markup Set Manager.
Even though you can attach DWF and DWFx files in AutoCAD, the markups
are not imported and managed this way. AutoCAD uses the Markup Set
Manager palette. You launch the Markup Set Manager palette by using the
MARKUP command. You can start the MARKUP command in one of the
following ways:
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Tools menu➪Palettes➪Markup
Set Manager.
✦On the Standards toolbar, click Markup Set Manager .

B
ook IX is designed to help both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT users
improve their workflow through customization. The majority of the
customization options in Book IX are available in both AutoCAD and
AutoCAD LT. Although AutoCAD LT supports a majority of the same cus-
tomization options that AutoCAD does, there are exceptions. In this chapter,
I mention these exceptions as they arise.
Have you ever wanted to find out how to start AutoCAD with a specific user
profile or add your own custom command aliases? Maybe you already
understand some of the available customization options but want to find
out more about others. Whatever the reason, customization can help to
improve drawing accuracy and efficiency. Customization is not necessarily
easy, but you don’t have to be a programmer to take advantage of these fea-
tures either.
Why Customize AutoCAD?
AutoCAD is one of the most popular computer-aided drafting programs on
the market today, but if you take a good look at the program, you’ll probably
find that you’ve barely scratched the surface of what it can do. AutoCAD is
designed to be flexible and adaptive to the way you work. And if you don’t
like the layout of the program, you can always change the way it looks.
Not only can you customize the user interface, or UI, but you can also make
changes to reduce repetitive tasks and ensure that CAD standards are followed.
The level of customization that AutoCAD offers is much more dynamic than
many other programs. Customizing AutoCAD is often confused with topics such
as AutoLISP and VBA. While AutoLISP and VBA can be used to customize
AutoCAD, they fall into the category of programming and are covered in Bonus

Why Customize AutoCAD?
640
Chapters 2 through 5 at www.wiley.com/go/autocad2009aio. You can
customize AutoCAD without resorting to any programming.
AutoCAD offers a large variety of customization options — so many, in fact,
that you’ll probably not use all of them. The options range from creating new
ways to start commands to defining how AutoCAD starts. Customization can
be used also to define the appearance of line work in a drawing with custom
linetypes or custom patterns for hatched areas. Following is an overview of
the different customization options available in AutoCAD:
✦Drawing templates: You might not have thought of drawing templates as
a form of customization, but they can contain user created objects such
as a title block and any drafting settings that might be needed for a new
drawing. For more information on drawing templates, see Book I,
Chapter 4 and Book VIII, Chapter 1.
✦Blocks: Blocks are a form of customization because you are creating
reusable content that can be used in as many drawings as you want.
This is one of the most natural forms of customization because you are
extending the capabilities of AutoCAD without really knowing that
you’re customizing it. For more information on blocks, see Book VI,
Chapters 1 and 2.
✦Linetypes: Linetypes are used to control the appearance of line work in
a drawing file when it’s viewed and plotted. AutoCAD comes with a vari-
ety of default linetypes, but you may need to create your own for a proj-
ect to represent, for example, a cable line or a flow direction. For more
information on customizing linetypes, see Chapter 4 of this minibook. I
talk about using linetypes in Book I, Chapter 6.
✦Shapes: Shapes are one of the earliest forms of creating groups of
reusable geometry, predating even blocks. Shapes are still useful when
you want to create a complex linetype that can’t be represented with
dashes, dots, and gaps. For more information on shapes, see Chapter 4
of this minibook.
AutoCAD LT does not support the creation of custom Shape files
because it does not support the COMPILE command.
✦Hatch patterns: Hatch patterns control the appearance of filled or hatched
areas. AutoCAD ships with a number of default patterns, but you may want
to create hatch patterns to represent construction materials such as wood
or other patterns not available by default. For more information on hatch
patterns, see Chapter 4 of this minibook.
✦Tool palettes: Tool palettes have been around since AutoCAD 2004, and
they provide ways to organize and access reusable content such as blocks,
hatches, and command tools. Tool palettes allow for multiple levels of
organization, so you can access the right tool or content quickly based on
the task you’re performing. For more information on customizing tool
palettes, see Book VI, Chapter 4.

✦User profiles: User profiles control the appearance of AutoCAD, drafting
settings, and where AutoCAD should look to find core and user-customized
files. For more information on user profiles, see “Changing Options and
Working with User Profiles” later in this chapter.
✦User interface: The user interface refers to the visual aspect of
AutoCAD’s controls, such as toolbars, ribbon panels, and pull-down
menus. Many components of the user interface can be customized by
using the Customize User Interface (CUI) editor. For more information on
customizing the user interface, see Chapter 3 of this minibook.
✦Diesel: Diesel is a macro language that can be used to customize the
status bar area of AutoCAD and to control parts of the user interface,
such as pull-down menu items. For more information on using Diesel,
see Chapter 2 of this minibook.
✦Command aliases: Command aliases are used to allow faster access to
commands from the command line. Many common commands in
AutoCAD are associated with a command alias. An example of a com-
mand alias is L for the LINE command. For more information on com-
mand aliases, see “Creating and Managing Command Aliases” later in
this chapter.
✦Scripts: Script files are structured files that allow you to automate standard
commands and options. Because these files are based on commands and
options that you already use, they are fairly easy to create to reduce
repetitive tasks. For more information on script files, see Chapter 4 of
this minibook.
✦Command line switches: Command line switches allow you to control
the startup behavior of AutoCAD. For more information on command
line switches, see “Using command line switches” later in this chapter.
✦Action macros: Action macros are the newest option AutoCAD offers for
customizing and reducing repetitive tasks. With Action Recorder, you can
record many of the commands that you’re already familiar with and then
play back the recorded sequence of commands. For more information on
action macro files and Action Recorder, see Chapter 5 of this minibook.
Customizing the AutoCAD Startup Process
AutoCAD offers a number of options to control how it starts. Some of these
options can be controlled through the desktop shortcut (or icon), whereas
others are controlled through specially named files.
Startup options
Several startup options are available to you. Some require a basic knowledge
of programming. AutoCAD LT does not support any of the programming
options that AutoCAD does, so it is limited to the startup options that do not

Customizing the AutoCAD Startup Process
642
involve a programming language. Following is an overview of the startup
options in AutoCAD:
✦Command line switches: Command line switches are parameters that
can be defined with a shortcut file that is used to start AutoCAD.
Command line switches can perform a variety of tasks, from starting
with a specific drawing template to specifying the default workspace.
For more information on command line switches, see “Using command
line switches” later in this chapter.
✦Acad.dvb: Acad.dvb is a VBA project that is automatically loaded at
startup. For more information on the Acad.dvb file, see Bonus Chapter 3
on the Web (www.wiley.com/go/autocad2009aio).
✦Acad.lsp, Acaddoc.lsp, Acad2009.lsp, Acaddoc2009.lsp: These AutoLISP
files are automatically loaded at the startup of AutoCAD. Neither Acad.lsp
nor Acaddoc.lsp ships with the program but instead must be created by
you. For more information on the files Acad.lsp, Acaddoc.lsp, Acad2009.
lsp, and Acaddoc2009.lsp, see Bonus Chapter 3 at www.wiley.com/go/
autocad2009aio.
✦Acad.mnl: Acad.mnl is an AutoLISP file that is associated with the Acad.cui
customization file and is loaded when the customization file is loaded. For
more information on the Acad.mnl file, see Chapter 3 in this minibook.
✦Acad.rx: Acad.rx is a plain text file that defines which ObjectARX or
ObjectDBX files should be loaded at startup. For more information on
the Acad.rx file, see Bonus Chapter 3 on the Web
(www.wiley.com/go/autocad2009aio).
✦Appload — Startup Suite: The Startup Suite is a feature of the Application
Load dialog box to load custom programs developed with AutoLISP, VBA,
and ObjectARX. For more information on using the Startup Suite, see
Bonus Chapter 3 on the Web (www.wiley.com/go/autocad2009aio).
✦LISP Files node: The LISP Files node in the Customize User Interface
(CUI) Editor can be used to load files when the CUI file is loaded. For
more information on adding AutoLISP files to the LISP Files node of a CUI
file, see Chapter 3 in this minibook.
Of the startup options that were just mentioned, AutoCAD LT supports only
the use of command line switches. All the other options are related to pro-
gramming, which AutoCAD LT does not support.
Using command line switches
Command line switches control the behavior of AutoCAD when it is started
from a desktop shortcut or the Start menu. You can customize the desktop
shortcut so that a specific drawing template is used to create the default
drawing displayed when AutoCAD is started. You can use command line

switches also to control which user profile is used when AutoCAD starts.
This enables you to have multiple profiles for AutoCAD on the computer and
use different desktop shortcuts to switch between them. When using com-
mand line switches, make sure that you use “ ” (double quote marks) around
the name of a drawing or drawing template file, a workspace, or a path that
contains a space. If you don’t use “ ” around a name or path that contains a
space, AutoCAD will assume it is another command line switch or argument.
Table 1-1 lists the different command line switches that are available for
AutoCAD.

Creating a new desktop shortcut
Follow these steps to create a new desktop shortcut:
1. Right-click the Windows Start button and click Explore.
Windows Explorer is launched.
2. Navigate to the AutoCAD install folder.
By default, AutoCAD 2009 is installed in the folder C:\Program
Files\AutoCAD 2009 (or AutoCAD LT 2009 for AutoCAD LT users). The
contents of the AutoCAD 2009 (or AutoCAD LT 2009) folder are displayed
in the pane on the right side of Windows Explorer.
3. Locate the acad.exe (or acadlt.exe) file, right-click the file name, and
choose Copy.
The information about the executable file is copied to the Windows
Clipboard.
4. Minimize all open applications until you see the Windows desktop.
5. Right-click an empty area of the desktop and choose Paste Shortcut
from the shortcut menu.
A new desktop shortcut is created titled Shortcut to acad.exe (or
Shortcut to acadlt.exe).
You can right-click an empty area of the Windows taskbar and click Show the
Desktop instead of minimizing all application windows one at a time. If you
have a keyboard with a flying Windows key, you can also press and hold
down the key while pressing the M key to minimize all application windows.
Modifying a desktop shortcut
Follow this procedure to modify the AutoCAD desktop shortcut and add a
command line switch:
1. Right-click the AutoCAD (or AutoCAD LT) desktop shortcut and choose
Properties.
The Properties dialog box (see Figure 1-1) for the desktop shortcut is
displayed.
2. Click the General tab. In the Name text box next to the icon, enter a
new name for the desktop shortcut (see Figure 1-2).
3. Click the Shortcut tab. Locate the Target text field just above the
middle of the Shortcut Properties dialog box.
The Target text field controls the string that’s executed when the short-
cut is double-clicked with the pointing device.

Customizing the AutoCAD Startup Process
646
4. Position the cursor to the right of the text in the Target text field and click.
The cursor should be located to the right of the text C:\Program
Files\AutoCAD 2009\acad.exe (or AutoCAD LT 2009\acadlt.exe).
5. Enter a space and then add the command line switches you want to
use (see Figure 1-3).
For example, you might enter /nologo /t “Tutorial-iArch”. The /nologo
switch suppresses the splash screen and the /t switch with the specified
drawing template is used to create the default Drawing1.dwg file.
If a value that is used with a command line switch has a space, you must
place it between double quotation marks (“ and ”). This applies to
values such as file paths and profile names.
6. Click OK to save the changes and exit the shortcut Properties dialog box.

7. Double-click the desktop shortcut to start AutoCAD.
You should notice that no splash screen is displayed when AutoCAD
starts and the default drawing Drawing1.dwg now has a title block based
on the one defined in the drawing template Tutorial-iArch.DWT.
Changing Options and Working with User Profiles
The Options dialog box (Figure 1-4) is the central hub for controlling many of
the behavioral attributes of AutoCAD. From the Options dialog box, you can
control drafting settings for grips, selection methods, and the appearance of
AutoSnap markers when using running object snaps. The Options dialog box
also contains settings that control the appearance of AutoCAD and where it
looks to find its support files.

individually. Instead, here is an overview of the types of options found on
each tab in the dialog box:
✦Files: The folders that the program uses to search for support, menu,
user-defined, and other files.
✦Display: Options that control how a drawing is viewed, along with set-
tings that control the appearance of the program’s application window.
✦Open and Save: Options that control the processes of opening and
saving files.
✦Plot and Publish: Options for outputting a drawing or a set of drawings
to hard copy or electronic formats.
✦System: Options that control the pointing device and some other general
options that control the behavior of the program.

✦User Preferences: Options that are unique to users and the way they
work with certain features in the program.
✦Drafting: Options that affect how things, such as points, are selected in
a drawing and how you are prompted for input.
✦3D Modeling: Options that affect the creation of 3D objects and navigat-
ing a 3D model.
✦Selection: Options that affect how objects are selected and the behavior
of grip editing.
✦Profiles: Options to create and manage user profiles.
The Options dialog boxes for AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT have numerous dif-
ferences. The two biggest differences are that AutoCAD LT does not support
user profiles or 3D modeling, so it does not have the 3D Modeling and
Profiles tabs.
Some options are stored in the drawing, whereas others are not saved at all
or are stored in the Windows Registry. The options that can be set through
the Options dialog box and are stored in the drawing are denoted with the
small drawing file icon to the left of the option.
Working with user profiles
A user profile stores options that are defined in the Options dialog box by a
given name. This allows you to access a specific configuration of options for
task-based procedures or to share them with others in your company. User
profiles are stored in the Windows Registry.
Creating a user profile
Follow this procedure to create a new user profile in AutoCAD:
1. Launch the Options dialog box by using one of the previously
described methods.
The Options dialog box is displayed.
2. Click the Profiles tab.
The options for working with profiles are displayed. In the upper-left
corner, you can find out which profile is current (see Figure 1-6).
Figure 1-6:

3. Click the Add to List button.
The Add Profile dialog box (see Figure 1-7) is displayed.
4. In the Profile Name text box, enter a name. In the Description text
box, enter a description.
The name is what appears in the Available Profiles list and what can be
used with the /p command line switch to load a profile at startup. For
more information on command line switches, see the “Using command
line switches” section earlier in this chapter.
5. Click Apply & Close to add the profile to the list.
The Add Profile dialog box closes, the new user profile is added to the
Available Profiles list, and you return to the Options dialog box.
6. Click OK to exit the Options dialog box.
Setting a user profile current
Follow this procedure to set a user profile current:
1. Launch the Options dialog box by using one of the previously
described methods.
2. Click the Profiles tab.

set current and then click Set Current.
The user profile is set current and the options are applied to AutoCAD.
4. Click OK to exit the Options dialog box.
Exporting and importing a user profile
Profiles can be exported from AutoCAD, which enables you to back them up
in case you need to reinstall AutoCAD or to share them with other AutoCAD
users in your company. Follow these steps to export a user profile and then
import it back into AutoCAD:

file or use the paths from the current profile. To use the paths from the
user profile file that is being imported, click Include Path Information.
10. Click Apply & Close to complete the importing of the user profile.
A new user profile based on the imported user profile file is added to the
Available Profiles list; if a profile with the same name as the one speci-
fied in the Name text box of the Import Profile dialog box already
existed, the options of the existing profile are updated.
11. Click OK to exit the Options dialog box.
Creating and Managing Command Aliases
Command aliases provide a quick way for you to access a command from
the command prompt without being forced to type the entire command
name. Command aliases are stored in the Acad.pgp (or Aclt.pgp) file, which
is a plain text file stored by default under C:\Documents and Settings\<user
name>\Application Data\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2009\R17.2\enu\Support (or
C:\Documents and Settings\<user name>\Application Data\Autodesk\
AutoCAD LT 2009\R14\enu\Support). You often hear these files referred to
as the program’s PGP (Program Parameters) files. An example of a command
alias is L, which is used to start the LINE command.
Editing the PGP file
Because a PGP file is a plain text file, it can be edited by using a text editor
such as Notepad. Two different formats of aliases can be created: external
commands and command aliases. External commands allow you to start
applications such as Notepad outside AutoCAD, and command aliases allow
you to start commands found inside AutoCAD such as the LINE command.
Typically, you use command aliases more often than external commands.
The PGP file allows you to define your own command aliases or modify the
ones that come with AutoCAD. Adding any new command aliases to the
bottom of the PGP file is the best practice: If you do, AutoCAD can identify
which ones you have added when you upgrade to a future release of
AutoCAD. One thing to note is that if two command aliases define the same
alias, the latter one defined in the file is the one that AutoCAD recognizes
when it is entered at the command prompt.

Book IX
Chapter 1
The Basics 
of Customizing
AutoCAD
Creating and Managing Command Aliases
653
Here’s a sample of the PGP file:
J,         *JOIN
L,         *LINE
LA,        *LAYER
The syntax for a command alias is as follows:
Alias, *AutoCAD Command Name
You should keep the alias to as few characters as possible because the
whole idea of an alias is to save you keystrokes. Between the alias and com-
mand name, you must use a comma to separate the two arguments, and the
command name must be prefixed with * (an asterisk).
AutoCAD LT doesn’t support external commands in the PGP file.
Opening the PGP file
To open the PGP file for the program, use one of the following methods:
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Tools menu➪Customize➪Edit
Program Parameters (acad.pgp) or (aclt.pgp).
✦Start Notepad, browse to the location of the PGP file, and open it.
Adding a new command alias
Follow these procedures to create a new command alias:
1. Open the PGP file by using one of the previously described methods.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the file to the User Defined Command Aliases
section.
This is where you should add your own command aliases. Command
aliases placed below this section can be migrated forward by using the
Migrate Custom Settings dialog box when you upgrade to a new release
of AutoCAD.
AutoCAD uses the last alias it finds in the file; this way, your custom
command alias can be migrated to a new release if you decide to
upgrade in the future.
3. On a new line, enter the alias you want and the AutoCAD command
that should be executed when the alias is typed at the command prompt.
A command alias uses the syntax Alias,*Command.

Creating and Managing Command Aliases
654
Don’t make changes to any of the command aliases that come with
AutoCAD; instead, create a new command alias with the same alias name
and add it to the User Defined Command Aliases section. If you make
changes to the command aliases that come with AutoCAD, the command
aliases will not be migrated to a future release when you install an
upgrade to the program in the future.
The new command alias is now defined in the PGP file.
4. On the menu bar in Notepad, choose File➪Save.
The new command alias is saved to the PGP file.
5. Switch back to AutoCAD, and type REINIT at the command prompt and
press Enter.
The Re-initialization dialog box (see Figure 1-9) is displayed.
6. Select the PGP File option and then click OK.
The changes to the PGP file are available for use right away; you don’t
need to close and restart AutoCAD.
Working with the AutoCAD Alias Editor
You may have heard about a collection of tools called Express Tools, which
extend the base functionality of AutoCAD in a variety of useful ways. One of
the tools in the collection is called the AutoCAD Alias Editor (see Figure 1-10).
This utility allows you to create both external commands and command
aliases by using a dialog box interface instead of a text editor like Notepad. It
also provides you with a list of all the available commands and system vari-
ables in the program. For more information on Express Tools, see Chapter 4
in this minibook.

 Controlling the appearance of AutoCAD
 Tuning the display of objects in a drawing
 Organizing your space
A
utoCAD allows you to personalize the overall appearance of the appli-
cation window and display settings that can affect performance. Many
users personalize their AutoCAD session to reflect the way they like to work
or the way they want things displayed on-screen. AutoCAD provides you
with a lot of control over the appearance of colors and font sizes throughout
the application window. The appearance settings include changing the back-
ground color of the drawing window and the color of the crosshairs, and
controlling the font style and size of text in the command line window.
Not only does AutoCAD offer a variety of options to control the appearance
of specific elements found in the application, but it also provides options to
control where and if certain user interface elements are displayed. Some of the
features that you can control are the buttons on the status bar and the icons in
the AutoCAD tray. This chapter explains how to control the appearance of
AutoCAD and how to control the display and placement of user interface items
such as toolbars and pull-down menus.
Influencing Your Status (Bar)
AutoCAD takes full advantage of every space on its application window. Auto
CAD has two status bars, one located at the bottom of the application window
and another at the bottom of the drawing window. Both status bars offer a
variety of tools that allow for quick access to drafting settings and even noti-
fications about changes taking place in the software and the current drawing.

Influencing Your Status (Bar)
658
Some of the tools allow you to toggle a drafting setting on or off; others access
a dialog box related to a drafting tool so you can control the behavior of the
tool; still others can be used to start a command or change switch scales. For
more information on each control on the status bar, see Book I, Chapter 3.
AutoCAD allows you to control the display of various user interface elements,
and the status bar is no different. You can control the display of each of the
different controls found on the application and drawing window status bars.
The application status bar displays the controls and icons available to all
open drawings; the drawing window status bar displays the controls and
icons specific to the current drawing. When the drawing window status bar
is turned off, all the controls and icons are displayed in the application
status bar.
You control the display of the drawing status bar and which controls are dis-
played on the application status bar by clicking the Status Bar Menu button.
There are two Status Bar Menu buttons; one is specific to the application
and the other is specific to a drawing window. The Status Bar Menu buttons
appear as a small downward-pointing black arrow in the lower-right corner
of the application or drawing window (see Figure 2-1).
When one of the Status Bar Menu buttons is clicked, a pop-up menu is dis-
played that contains options to control the display of the different controls
on the status bar. Select the item whose display you want to toggle. A check
mark next to an item signifies that that item is currently displayed on the
status bar. Figure 2-2 shows the pop-up menu that is displayed when the
Application Status Bar Menu button is clicked.
Displaying the drawing status bar
The drawing status bar allows you to keep the application status bar clean
and simple looking. There is no significant reason to use it or not, other than
a personal preference. As mentioned, if the drawing status bar is not dis-
played, all the controls that would be displayed on the drawing status bar
are displayed on the application status bar.
Follow these steps to turn the drawing status bar on and off:
1. Click the Application Status Bar Menu button (refer to Figure 2-1).
A pop-up menu with options to control the different tools on the applica-
tion status bar is displayed.
2. Select Drawing Status Bar.
If the Drawing Status Bar option was not selected, the drawing status bar
is displayed. Otherwise, the drawing status bar display is turned off.

Toggling the display of a control on the status bars
If there are things on the status bar that you just don’t use, you might want
to turn them off. For example, if you don’t use the Cursor Coordinate Values
display because you use dynamic input, you might want to turn it off.
Follow these steps to toggle the display of a control on the status bar:
1. Click the button for the application or drawing status bar (refer to
Figure 2-1).
A pop-up menu with options to control the different tools on the status
bar is displayed.
2. Select an item other than Tray Settings.
The display of the selected item is toggled on or off, and the position of
the remaining controls on the status bar is updated.
Tray icons, located in the lower-right corner of the application or drawing
status bar, allow you to quickly access certain features. For more information
on each of the icons that you may encounter in the application or drawing
tray, see Book I, Chapter 3.

You can customize the display of the icons in the tray along with other set-
tings that affect the notification system used in AutoCAD for the services
represented by the icons. Here is an overview of the tray settings:
✦Display icons for services: Controls whether icons for services that are
running in AutoCAD are displayed in the icon tray on the status bar.
✦Display notifications from services: Controls whether the services dis-
play a notification balloon when something they are monitoring changes.
✦Display time: Controls the maximum length of time (in seconds) that a
notification balloon should be displayed before it’s automatically closed.
The time range is from 1 to 10 seconds.
✦Display until closed: Controls whether a notification balloon for a service
is displayed until it’s dismissed.
Follow these steps to change a tray setting:
1. Click the Application Status Bar Menu button (refer to Figure 2-1).
A pop-up menu with options to control the different tools on the applica-
tion status bar is displayed.
2. On the menu, select Tray Settings.
The Tray Settings dialog box (see Figure 2-3) is displayed.
3. Change the options to the desired settings and click OK.
The Tray Settings dialog box closes and the notification system and
status bars are updated based on the selected options.
Powering the status bar with DIESEL
DIESEL (Direct Interpretively Evaluated String Expression Language) is a
macro language that allows you to control the behavior of menu macros and
display text on the application status bar. This can be a great way to display
information about drafting settings that is not normally displayed on the appli-
cation status bar, such as linetype scale or the current elevation for drawing
new objects. The MODEMACRO system variable is used to display a DIESEL
macro on the application status bar. The result of the macro is displayed on
the far left side of the application status bar (see Figure 2-4).
Figure 2-3:
Customize
the
notification
system.

Book IX
Chapter 2
Customizing the
Interface
Influencing Your Status (Bar)
661
The DIESEL expression used to generate the results shown in Figure 2-4 is
$(eval, “LtScale: “ $(getvar, “ltscale”) “ Elevation: “
$(getvar, “elevation”))
Because DIESEL is a macro language, you can use a number of functions with
it. DIESEL offers functions for manipulating strings, performing mathematics,
and getting system variable values. Some of the more common functions
available in DIESEL are
✦Eval: Passes the DIESEL expression to the evaluator and returns a value
✦Upper: Converts the string to all uppercase letters
✦If: Returns one of two values based on whether the conditional expres-
sion is true or false
✦Getvar: Returns the current value of the specified system variable
✦+: Returns the sum of all the provided numbers
✦–: Returns the results of subtracting all the provided numbers from each other
For more information on other DIESEL functions, refer to the Catalog of
DIESEL Functions topic in the AutoCAD Help system.
Follow these steps to display the results of a DIESEL expression on the
status bar:
1. At the command prompt, type MODEMACRO.
AutoCAD displays the command prompt:
Enter new value for MODEMACRO, or . for none <””>:
2. Enter the DIESEL expression that you want evaluated and displayed
on the application status bar, or enter just a period (.) to end the eval-
uation of the current DIESEL expression and reset the value back to
no DIESEL expression (“”). Then press Enter to start the evaluation.

Training Your Toolbars, Panels, and Dockable Windows to Stay
662
AutoCAD updates the application status bar with the results of the
DIESEL expression or returns an error message (see Figure 2-5) in its
place. The figure shows that the + function can’t be evaluated by dis-
playing $(+, ??) on the application status bar. The error occurred
because a string (A) can’t be added to a number (2).
Training Your Toolbars, Panels, 
and Dockable Windows to Stay
Have you ever tried to click a toolbar, panel, or dockable window (palette)
only to accidentally move it? This can cause all sorts of cascading effects:
Toolbars and panels can end up being shuffled or, even worse, the toolbar,
panels, or dockable window might even disappear from the screen. Most of
us like everything to stay put.
This is where the user interface (UI) lock option comes into play. With the UI
lock option, you can make toolbars, panels, and dockable windows that are
floating or docked stay put on-screen. When the option is turned on, you
can’t accidentally move them from their current position. This is especially
useful if you’re using a dual monitor setup, where you might have the tool-
bars, panels, and dockable windows on a separate monitor.
Locking toolbars, panels, and dockable windows
To lock toolbars, panels, and dockable windows, use one of these methods:
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Window menu➪Lock Location
and select one of the available options.
✦Click the Toolbar/Window Positions icon on the application status bar
and then click one of the available options from the shortcut menu.
✦At the command prompt, type LOCKUI and specify a value based on the
sum of the bitcodes for the UI elements you want locked or unlocked.

8
Floating dockable windows are locked.
Because the value of the LOCKUI system variable is the sum of all the bit-
codes, to lock both docked toolbars and dockable windows, you use a value
of 3. A value of 1 controls the locking toolbars and panels and a value of 2
controls the locking of the dockable windows (1 + 2).
Locking and unlocking toolbars, panels, 
and dockable windows
Follow these steps to lock and unlock toolbars, panels, and dockable win-
dows in the AutoCAD user interface:
1. On the menu browser or menu bar, click Window menu➪Lock
Location➪Docked Toolbars.
The grip handles on the left side of the toolbar (see Figure 2-6) are
removed and the toolbar can’t be undocked or relocated. A check mark
appears next to Docked Toolbars.

The grip handles on the left side of the toolbar are visible again. The
toolbar can be undocked and relocated once again. The check mark next
to Docked Toolbars disappears.
Controlling the Appearance of AutoCAD 
and the Drawing Window
AutoCAD allows you to customize not only the display of controls on the
status bars but also the color scheme used throughout the application. The
color scheme can range from the background color of the drawing window
to the color of the crosshairs.
The display settings for AutoCAD can be found in the Options dialog box; on
the menu browser or menu bar, choose Tools menu➪Options. In the Options
dialog box that appears, click the Display tab. Make the desired changes to
the display options and click OK. In the next sections, I cover many of the
options found on the Display tab (see Figure 2-7) that affect the appearance
of AutoCAD.
Window elements
The options for AutoCAD’s window elements are in the Options dialog box
on the Display tab under Window Elements. The Window Elements section
holds settings for controlling the color scheme of AutoCAD, the display of

large buttons, among other settings.
Here is an overview of the options in the Window Elements section:
✦Color Scheme: Controls the internal color scheme used for various user
interface elements that are part of the AutoCAD application window. The
user interface elements that are affected are toolbars, palettes, the
ribbon bar, status bars and the menu browser frame.
✦Display Scroll Bars in Drawing Window: Toggles the display of the
vertical and horizontal scroll bars in a drawing window.
✦Display Drawing Status Bar: Toggles the display of the drawing status
bar in a drawing window.
✦Display Screen Menu: Toggles the display of the legacy screen menu
(sidebar menu).
✦Use Large Buttons for Toolbars: Toggles whether toolbars should be
displayed with icons that are 16 × 16 or 32 × 32 pixels.
✦Show ToolTips: Toggles the display of tooltips when the cursor is hover-
ing over a toolbar button.
✦Show Shortcut Keys in ToolTips: Toggles the display of shortcut keys
associated with a command as part of the tooltip when the cursor is
hovering over a toolbar button.
✦Show Extended ToolTips: Toggles the display of extended tooltips,
which are displayed when the cursor continues to hover over a menu
item on the menu browser or a button on a toolbar or ribbon panel.
✦Number of Second Delay: Specifies the delay (in seconds) before the
extended tooltip is displayed. If set to 0, the extended tooltip is dis-
played with no delay.
✦Show Rollover ToolTips: Toggles the display of rollover tooltips, which
are displayed when the crosshairs continue to hover over an object in the
drawing window. The rollover tooltip displays the values of a specified set
of properties for the object over which the crosshairs is hovering.
✦Colors: Opens the Drawing Window Color dialog box (see Figure 2-8) and
allows you to change the color for the defined interface elements of the
different application contexts.
✦Fonts: Opens the Command Line Window Font dialog box (see Figure 2-9)
so you can specify the attributes of the font that should be used for text in
the command line window and AutoCAD text window.

The options for AutoCAD’s layout elements are in the Options dialog box on
the Display tab. The Layout Elements section holds settings for controlling
the appearance of Layout tabs other than the Model tab, the visibility of both
Model and Layout tabs at the bottom of the drawing window, and other settings.
Here is an overview of the options in the Layout Elements section:
✦Display Layout and Model tabs: Controls the display of the Model and
Layout tabs at the bottom of the drawing window.
✦Display Printable Area: Controls the display of the printable area. The

✦Display Paper Background: Controls the display of the area that repre-
sents the size of the paper. The paper background is determined by the
selected paper size and the specified plot scale.
✦Display Paper Shadow: Controls the display of a shadow around the
bottom and right edges of the paper background to give the effect that
you are working on a piece of actual paper.
✦Show Page Setup Manager for New Layouts: Controls the display of
Paper Setup Manager when a new layout is added to a drawing. The
dialog box is displayed only if the layout has not been initialized yet.
✦Create Viewport in New Layouts: Controls whether or not a single view-
port is created when switching to a layout that has not been initialized yet.
Size of the crosshairs
The option for controlling the size of the crosshairs is in the Options dialog
box on the Display tab in the Crosshair Size section. You can specify the size
of the crosshairs as a percentage of the total screen size. The default percent-
age of the drawing window is 5, but the range is from 1 to 100.
Using a value of 100 can make it easy to visually align dimensions or text
objects. Of course, when it comes to accurately creating objects in a drawing,
you shouldn’t rely on the eyeball, or close-enough, technique. When you need
to accurately create objects, be sure to use objects snaps and other drawing
aids. After all, the accuracy of the drawings you create can be critical.
Other settings
In addition to the display-related settings on the Display tab of the Options
dialog box, other settings in the Options dialog box affect the appearance of
many other features that you’ve already encountered in AutoCAD. Some of
these settings control the color and size of grips as well as the tooltips used
for dynamic input. The following is a list of additional places where you can
look to alter the appearance of AutoCAD and some of its tools and user inter-
face elements:
✦Drafting tab of the Options dialog box: The Drafting tab allows you to
control the appearance of the aperture size on the crosshairs, the
AutoSnap marker size and color (which is used with object snaps), draft-
ing tooltips settings for dynamic input, and the settings for light and
camera glyphs.
AutoCAD LT does not have light and camera glyph settings on the
Drafting tab of the Options dialog box.

Organizing Your Space
668
✦3D Modeling tab of the Options dialog box: The 3D Modeling tab allows
you to control the appearance of the 3D crosshairs and when the View
Cube or UCS icon is displayed. For more information on the ViewCube
and working in 3D, see Book V.
The 3D Modeling tab of the Options dialog box is not in AutoCAD LT
because it doesn’t support working with 3D models other than being
able to view them.
✦UCS Icon dialog box: The UCS Icon dialog box allows you to control the
style, size, and color of the UCS icon. For more information on customiz-
ing the UCS icon and using the UCS icon, see Book V, Chapter 2.
Organizing Your Space
AutoCAD uses a feature called workspaces to allow you to control the layout
of user interface elements. Workspaces control user interface elements such
as toolbars, pull-down menus, and dockable windows. Workspaces are saved
with a user-defined name in a customization (CUI) file. A majority of work-
space customization is handled through the Customize User Interface (CUI)
Editor, but you can also do some customization of the workspace directly
from the application window of AutoCAD with the help of the WORKSPACE
command.
The WORKSPACE command allows you to set a workspace current, save, edit,
rename or delete a workspace, change the settings under which a workspace
is updated, and control the order in which workspaces are displayed in the
user interface. For more information on how to use the CUI Editor with work-
spaces, see the section, “Using the Customize User Interface Editor,” later in
this chapter.
Using the Workspaces toolbar
The Workspaces toolbar (see Figure 2-10) offers some level of control over
workspaces but not the full control that the Customize User Interface (CUI)
Editor does.

From the Workspaces toolbar, you can do the following:
✦Set a Workspace Current: From the drop-down list, you can select one
of the defined workspaces and set it current.
✦Save a Workspace: From the drop-down list, you can select the Save
Current As option to save the current display settings for toolbars,
ribbon panels, and dockable windows. The Save Workspace dialog box
(see Figure 2-11) is displayed, allowing you to save the changes to over-
write an existing workspace or create a new one.
✦Workspace Settings: The button to the right of the drop-down list on the
Workspaces toolbar displays the Workspace Settings dialog box (see
Figure 2-12). The Workspace Settings dialog box allows you to specify
which workspace is set current when the My Workspace button is
clicked on the Workspaces toolbar. The dialog box also allows you to
change the order in which workspaces appear in the drop-down list of
the Workspaces toolbar and the Workspaces submenu on the Tools
menu located on the menu browser or menu bar, and control whether
changes to the current workspace are saved automatically before
switching workspaces.
✦My Workspace: Sets the workspace specified in the Workspace Settings
dialog box current.

All the tools that are on the Workspaces toolbar, except for the My
Workspace tool, are on the menu browser and menu. Simply choose Tools
menu➪Workspaces.
Creating a new workspace
Follow these steps to create a new workspace by using the Workspaces toolbar:
1. If the Workspaces toolbar is not displayed, right-click the Quick
Access toolbar and choose Toolbars➪AutoCAD (or AutoCAD LT if
you’re using AutoCAD LT)➪Workspaces.
2. Move some of the toolbars and dockable windows around on-screen.
By moving some of the toolbars and dockable windows, you should be
able to tell whether the changes have been saved to the new workspace.
3. On the Workspaces toolbar, select Save Current As from the
Workspaces drop-down list.
The Save Workspace dialog box is displayed.
4. In the Name text box, enter a name for the new workspace. Click Save.
The new workspace is saved to the main customization file and added to
the drop-down list on the Workspaces toolbar. An entry for the new
workspace is also added under Tools menu➪Workspaces on the menu
browser and menu bar.
5. Switch between different saved workspaces from the drop-down list
to see how they are different.
Saving changes to an existing workspace
To update an existing workspace, follow the same steps that were in the pre-
ceding section, “Creating a new workspace.” However, instead of entering a
name in the Name text box in Step 4, select an existing workspace in the
drop-down list. Then click the Save button to update the workspace.
Using the Customize User Interface Editor
The Customize User Interface (CUI) Editor, unlike the Workspaces toolbar,
offers a full range of control over workspaces. The one thing that you can’t
define by using the CUI Editor is which workspace is displayed when the My
Workspace button on the Workspaces toolbar is clicked.
From the CUI Editor, you can do the following:
✦Create a workspace: The Customizations In pane allows you to create a
new workspace.

Maximizing the drawing space
AutoCAD displays tools such as toolbars, menus, the ribbon bar, and status
bars throughout the user interface so you can quickly access different draft-
ing tools as you need them. At times, you may not need these tools and may
instead want more space to work with. AutoCAD offers a tool that suppresses
the display of some of the user interface elements so you have more drawing
real estate; this tool is called Clean Screen.
Clean Screen does exactly what the name suggests: It gives you a clean
screen to work with. It maximizes AutoCAD, turns off all the toolbars, ribbon
panels, and dockable windows (palettes), and even hides the caption bar
along the top of AutoCAD. The menu bar is still available along with the com-
mand line window if they’re displayed before Clean Screen is enabled.
To use the Clean Screen tool, do one of the following:
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click View menu➪Clean Screen.
✦Click the Clean Screen icon, which is located on the rightmost side of the
application status bar.
✦Press Ctrl+0 (zero).
✦At the command prompt, type CLEANSCREENON and press Enter.
Typing CLEANSCREENOFF and pressing Enter returns AutoCAD to its
previous state.

A
utoCAD customization goes beyond just being able to change the
appearance of the application window or controlling the regeneration
process of a drawing. AutoCAD allows you to create your own toolbars,
menus, shortcut keys, and ribbon tabs and panels, among other user inter-
face elements. This flexibility allows you to further integrate AutoCAD into
your workflow and to manage CAD standards.
To customize the user interface, you use the Customize User Interface (CUI)
Editor. The CUI Editor is a graphical editor that reads and writes to cus-
tomization files that have a CUI file extension. The CUI Editor and CUI file
format were introduced in AutoCAD 2006.
How Customizing the User Interface Has Changed
Users have been able to customize the user interface dating all the way back
to AutoCAD R12 and even earlier releases. Since then, many additions have
been made to the user interface, including toolbars and shortcut keys, but
one thing has always remained consistent: Customization was done by edit-
ing an ASCII text file with a text editor outside AutoCAD. That all changed
with AutoCAD 2006 and the CUI file format.

Getting to Know the Customize User Interface Editor
676
If you are relatively new to AutoCAD, you might not know much about previ-
ous releases of the program. Those of you who have done some menu cus-
tomization with AutoCAD 2005 and earlier releases might be familiar with the
MNU, MNS, MNC, and MNR file types. The CUI file format replaced the MNU,
MNS, and MNC file formats, but the MNR file type is still used even to this
date. A description of each file type that I just mentioned follows:
✦MNU: A Menu Template file was used to build MNS files and contained
comments and the structure that defined the elements in the user inter-
face. This file needed to be updated manually and was an ASCII text file.
✦MNS: A Menu Source file was based on an MNU file and usually con-
tained fewer comments than the MNU file from which it was created, but
also contained the defined structure plus some additional elements that
might have been added by using the Customize dialog box in AutoCAD.
The file was an ASCII text file.
✦MNC: A Compiled Menu file was a binary version of an MNS file and was
the file that was loaded into AutoCAD to speed up the loading of the
user interface elements before the introduction of the CUI file.
✦CUI: A Customization file that is an XML-based file that replaced the use
of the MNU, MNS, and MNC files for customizing the user interface of
AutoCAD.
✦MNR: A Menu Resource file contains all the images used for the com-
mands in the complied MNU/MNS file or CUI file, and is a binary file.
Getting to Know the Customize User Interface Editor
The Customize User Interface (CUI) Editor (see Figure 3-1) is a graphically
based editor that allows you to customize many of the user interface ele-
ments, such as toolbars, menus, and the ribbon. It is also designed to allow
you to migrate and transfer existing menu customizations into the latest
release of AutoCAD. In the next few sections, I cover the different panes of
the CUI Editor, launching the CUI Editor, and some of the basics involved
with customizing the AutoCAD user interface.
The CUI Editor has three main panes: Customizations In pane, Command List
pane, and Dynamic pane. The Dynamic pane covers the entire right side of
the Customize tab of the CUI Editor and is the most active pane — it displays
information and properties for the selected item in the Customizations In or
Command List pane.

Book IX
Chapter 3
Customizing the

Getting to Know the Customize User Interface Editor
677
The Customizations In pane
In the Customizations In pane (see Figure 3-2), you access the user interface
elements of any of the loaded customization files in the CUI Editor. Two dif-
ferent base customization files can be loaded: main and enterprise customiza-
tion files. The main and enterprise customization files can load additional
files known as partial customization files. Enterprise and partial customiza-
tion files make managing and sharing customization with multiple users
easier. Each of the loaded customization files can contain any number and
type of user interface elements, such as toolbars, menus, shortcut keys, and
ribbon panels and tabs. The main and enterprise customization files that
should be loaded are specified under the Customization Files node of the
Files tab in the Options dialog box. For more information on partial and
enterprise customization files, see the section “Working with Partial and
Enterprise Customization Files” later in this chapter.
At the top of the Customizations In pane, you can open a customization file,
load a partial customization file, and save the changes to all the current cus-
tomization files. The tree view under the Customizations In pane is where
you create new user interface elements such as toolbars and menus. The
tree view allows you to add commands to a user interface element and con-
trol the order in which they appear after the CUI Editor is closed.
Figure 3-1:

User
Interface
(CUI) Editor.

Getting to Know the Customize User Interface Editor
678
The Command List pane
The Command List pane (see Figure 3-3) is where you find all the commands
contained in the loaded CUI files. This is one of the best changes in menu
customization since AutoCAD 2005 and earlier. In releases of AutoCAD prior
to 2005, if you wanted to use the same command for a toolbar button, a menu
item, and a shortcut key, you had to duplicate the command macro three times.
If you needed to make a change to the macro, you had to change it three sepa-
rate times. With the introduction of the CUI file and the CUI Editor, commands
are maintained in a centralized location and are referenced by the user inter-
face element that they are placed on and are not copies of the command.
The Command List pane is also where you go when you want to add a refer-
ence of a command to a user interface element, such as a toolbar. To add a
command to a toolbar, you drag it from the Command List pane and drop it
onto the correct node under the Toolbars node. Just above the Command
list in the Command List pane is a drop-down list that contains a set of cate-
gories that can be used to filter the commands displayed in the Command
List pane. You can also use the Search Command List box and the Filter the
Commands button to filter the Command list based on a specific keyword.

The Dynamic pane
The Dynamic pane runs vertically down the entire right side of the CUI Editor
and reacts to what you select in the Customizations In and Command List
panes. The Dynamic pane can display a number of different panes based on
what is selected on the left side of the CUI Editor. Here is an overview of
each of the different panes that can be displayed in the Dynamic pane:
✦Button Image: The Button Image pane (see Figure 3-4) allows you to access
and select one of the preloaded images for a button or create a new image.
The Button Image pane is active when a command is selected below one
of the nodes in the Customizations In pane or in the Command List pane.
✦Information: The Information pane provides an overview of each top-level
node in the Customizations In pane. The Information pane is available
only when a top-level node in the Customizations In pane is selected or
when one of the nodes under Keyboard Shortcuts or Legacy is selected.
✦Panel Preview: The Panel Preview pane allows you to get an idea of
what a panel looks like while you are adding, removing or modifying
commands and controls on a ribbon panel before you close the CUI
Editor. The Panel Preview pane is available only when a ribbon panel is
selected under the Ribbon Panels node of the Customizations In pane.
✦Properties: The Properties pane (see Figure 3-5) allows you to adjust the
properties of a selected item in the CUI Editor. The properties that can
be edited change based on the item selected.
Figure 3-5:
The
Properties
pane.

✦Quick Properties: The Quick Properties pane allows you to control
which object types and their properties are available when you use the
Quick Properties panel or rollover tooltips. You can control the display
of general properties and object-specific properties. The properties that
are available to display are the same ones that are displayed on the
Properties palette.
The Quick Properties pane is new in AutoCAD 2009 and is used for cus-
tomizing the properties of the Quick Properties panel and rollover tooltips.
✦Shortcuts: The Shortcuts pane provides you with an overview of all the
shortcut and temporary override keys that have been defined and also
allows you to print a copy of the keys or to copy the list of keys to the
Windows Clipboard.
✦Toolbar Preview: The Toolbar Preview pane allows you to get an idea of
what a toolbar looks like while you are adding, removing, or modifying
commands and controls on a toolbar before you close the CUI Editor.
The Toolbar Preview pane is available only when a toolbar is selected
under the Toolbars node of the Customizations In pane.
✦Workspace Contents: The Workspace Contents pane allows you to cus-
tomize which commands are displayed on the Quick Access toolbar, and
which toolbars, menus, ribbon tabs, and dockable windows should be
displayed when the workspace is set current. The pane is also used to
control the order of menus on the menu browser and menu bar, and the
order in which ribbon tabs appear on the ribbon.
Launching the CUI Editor
To launch the CUI Editor, use one of these methods:
✦On the ribbon, click Tools tab➪Customization panel➪User Interface.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Tools menu➪Customize➪
Interface.
✦At the command line, type CUI and press Enter.
✦Right-click a toolbar or ribbon panel, and then click Customize from the
shortcut menu that appears.
Commands in the CUI Editor
Commands in the CUI Editor are not the same as an AutoCAD command such
as LINE. A command in the CUI Editor can be made up of AutoCAD com-
mands, command options, and AutoLISP expressions. After you create a
command, you can use it with most of the user interface elements supported
in the CUI Editor.

Understanding a command macro
At the core of a command in the CUI Editor is its macro property. The macro
is what is carried out when the command is selected from a toolbar or
ribbon button, menu item, or one of the other user interface elements that is
referencing the command. Macros can contain special characters that are
normally not allowed at the command line.
Table 3-1 lists the most frequently used special characters that can be part
of a macro.

An example of a macro is
^C^C^C._line;\\\_c
This macro starts the LINE command, allows the user to select a total of
three points, and then closes the object, as follows:
✦^C^C^C issues three cancels to exit any running command.
✦._line starts the LINE command.
✦; issues an Enter to start the LINE command.
✦\\\ asks the user for three different input values. In this case, the input
should be in the form of coordinate input values.
✦_c uses the Close option of the LINE command to draw a line between
the first and last points.

Getting to Know the Customize User Interface Editor
682
When you want to make sure that no other command is running when your
macro begins, use three ^C sequences to make sure that the current com-
mand that might be active has ended. The DIM command requires two ^C
sequences to exit the command, while the –LAYER command can require up
to three at the lowest level of the Color option.
Creating a new command
Follow these steps to create a new command in the CUI Editor:
1. On the ribbon, click Tools tab➪Customization panel➪User Interface.
The CUI Editor is displayed.
2. In the Command List pane, click Create a New Command.
A new command named Command1 is added to the list box by default,
and the Button Image and Properties panes are displayed. If the name
already exists, the new command is named Command2 and so on.
3. In the Properties pane, change the command’s Name, Macro, and
Element ID.
The Name allows you to identify the command in the list under the
Command List pane; the Macro defines what happens when the command
is selected from the user interface; and the Element ID uniquely identifies
the command through automation or when migrating the command
between releases. For information on these and other properties, take a
look at the description provided at the bottom of the Properties pane.
4. Click Apply save the changes and stay in the CUI Editor, or click OK to
save the changes and exit the CUI Editor.
The changes are saved to the file.
The Tags and Extended Help File properties are new in AutoCAD 2009. The
Tags property allows you to group commands and locate commands when
performing a search for a command with the Search box on the menu
browser. The Extended Help File property allows you to add additional help
to a command’s tooltip that can contain illustrations and rich formatted text.
Assigning an image to a command
Assigning a small and large image to a command is optional. However, if you
plan on using the command on a toolbar, menu, or ribbon panel, you may want
to add images to the command so that it matches many of the commands that
come with AutoCAD. Follow these steps to assign an image to a command:

Book IX

1. On the ribbon, click Tools tab➪Customization panel➪User Interface.
The CUI Editor is displayed.
2. Select a command in the list.
The command is highlighted and its properties are displayed in the
Properties pane.
3. In the Button Image pane, select either the Large, Small, or Both
option. Then click one of the images in the list.
Based on the size option that you select, the value is populated in the
Small or Large (or both) Image properties for the command. Optionally,
you can also edit an existing image to create a new image for your com-
mand by using the Edit button. If you have an image that you created in
a separate program or one that exists from a previous release, you can
select the Small or Large Image fields in the Properties pane and then
click the ellipsis (. . .) button that is displayed (see Figure 3-6).
4. Click Apply to save the changes and stay in the CUI Editor, or click OK
to save the changes and exit the CUI Editor.
AutoCAD provides a special location for you to store custom icons for
commands. The location that AutoCAD designates by default is
C:\Documents and Settings\<user name>\Application
Data\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2009\R17.2\enu\Support\Icons
You can store your custom icons in this location or in one of AutoCAD’s sup-
port paths. You can change the location for the custom icons by clicking
Customization Files➪Custom Icon Location on the Files tab of the Options
dialog box.
Assigning a help string to a command
Assigning a help string to a command is optional. However, a help string can
give the users of the custom command a brief description of the command
before they select it. Help strings appear in the status bar when the cursor
hovers over a menu item on a pull-down or shortcut menu, or in a tooltip for
a menu item on the menu browser or a button on a toolbar or ribbon panel.
Figure 3-6:
Browsing

Customizing Toolbars, Pull-Down and Shortcut Menus, and the Ribbon
684
Even though user interface elements such as toolbars and menus have a
description property, the value entered is never displayed in the user inter-
face like it is for commands and therefore can be used for entering com-
ments about the toolbar or menu, such as revision information. Follow these
steps to assign a help string to a command:
1. On the ribbon, click Tools tab➪Customization panel➪User Interface.
The CUI Editor is displayed.
2. Select a command in the list.
The command is highlighted and its properties are displayed in the
Properties pane.
3. In the Properties pane, enter the help string value in the Description box.
4. Click Apply to save the changes and stay in the CUI Editor, or click OK
to save the changes and exit the CUI Editor.
In addition to using the Description box to provide a help string or tooltip
for a command, you can assign an extended help item stored in an XAML file
that can contain additional information about the command and might dis-
play an image to visually illustrate what the command does. Extended help
is displayed when the cursor hovers over a command on the menu browser,
toolbar, or ribbon panel for a designated time interval. To find out more about
creating and assigning extended help, open AutoCAD’s Help by pressing F1
and then click Contents tab➪Customization Guide➪Customize the User
Interface➪Customize Commands➪Create Tooltips and Extended Help for
Commands.
Extended help is displayed when the Show Extended ToolTip and Show
ToolTips options on the Display tab of the Options dialog box are selected.
In the Number of Seconds to Delay box on the Display tab of the Options
dialog box, you can set the time interval that the cursor must hover over a
command. Setting a time interval of 0 seconds causes the extended help to
be displayed when the tooltip is displayed.
Customizing Toolbars, Pull-Down and 
Shortcut Menus, and the Ribbon
Because AutoCAD is a Windows-based application, it utilizes toolbars,
menus, shortcut menus, and the ribbon as part of its user interface. These
are by far the most widely used UI elements in AutoCAD because they pro-
vide access to a majority of the drafting and editing commands that
AutoCAD has to offer.

Quick Access toolbar
The Quick Access toolbar is displayed in the upper-left corner of AutoCAD,
just to the right of the Menu Browser button. You can use the CUI Editor to
customize the Quick Access toolbar by adding, removing, and repositioning
commands. The commands that are displayed on the Quick Access toolbar
are based on the current workspace, so to customize the Quick Access tool-
bar you must first select the workspace you want to edit by selecting a work-
space under the Workspaces node in the Customizations In pane.
After a workspace is selected, the Workspace Contents pane is displayed in
the Dynamic pane. Expand the Quick Access Toolbar node and perform the
following:
✦Add a command: Select a command in the Command List pane. Hold
down the left or right mouse button, drag the selected command to the
Quick Access Toolbar node, and release the mouse button when the
cursor is over the Quick Access Toolbar node or the splitter bar is dis-
played where you want the command displayed.
✦Remove a command: Right-click a command under the Quick Access
Toolbar node, and choose Remove from Workspace.
✦Reposition a command: Select a command under the Quick Access tool-
bar and hold down the left or right mouse button. Then drag the com-
mand up or down and release the mouse button when the splitter bar is
displayed where you want the command to be displayed on the Quick
Access toolbar.
The Quick Access toolbar is a new user interface element that has been
added to AutoCAD 2009 and allows you to access a set of commands no
matter which toolbar or ribbon tabs are displayed.
Toolbars
Toolbars are small windows that can be docked along the edges of the appli-
cation window or undocked (floating). They allow you to quickly access
commands and options through buttons, drop-down lists, and flyouts. A
flyout is a way to access the commands contained on another toolbar
through a single button. They help keep the user interface looking clean
without the need to display the entire toolbar.

A new toolbar with the default name Toolbar1 is created under the
Toolbars node.
3. In the Properties pane, change the name and alias of the toolbar by
using the Name and Alias boxes.
The name allows you to identify the toolbar in the CUI Editor. The alias
uniquely identifies the toolbar through automation when migrating the
toolbar between releases, or when using the toolbar as a flyout. You can
also control how the toolbar is initially displayed through the properties
in the Appearance section.
4. In the Command List pane, select the command that you want to add
to the toolbar. Hold down the mouse button and drag the command to
the new toolbar under the Toolbars node of the Customizations In
pane. Release the mouse button when the cursor is over the toolbar
(see Figure 3-7).
A reference to the command is added under the toolbar.
To select more than one command at a time to assign to a toolbar, hold
down the Shift or Ctrl key while selecting commands.
5. Click Apply to save the changes and stay in the CUI Editor, or click OK
to save the changes and exit the CUI Editor.

When adding a new user interface element such as a toolbar or menu, make
sure to add a command to it before clicking Apply. Otherwise, the user inter-
face element will not be saved to the file.
Creating a new flyout
Follow these steps to create a flyout on a toolbar:
1. On the ribbon, click Tools tab➪Customization panel➪User Interface.
The CUI Editor is displayed.
2. Create a new toolbar and change its name and alias by using the
Name and Aliases boxes in the Properties pane.
A new toolbar is created under the Toolbars node, and the Name and
Alias properties are updated based on the provided values.
3. Click and drag the new toolbar above or below one of the commands
on the toolbar on which you want to create the flyout.
A new reference to the toolbar is created on the toolbar (see Figure 3-8).
4. Add commands to the new toolbar or flyout.
The new commands are displayed under the toolbar and flyout.
5. Click Apply to save the changes and stay in the CUI Editor, or click OK
to save the changes and exit the CUI Editor.
You can also right-click a toolbar and choose New Flyout to create a new
toolbar and add the flyout reference to a toolbar. This method does introduce
at least one additional step: When you rename the toolbar, the name of the
flyout does not change automatically to match the toolbar’s name, so you
have to rename both the flyout and the toolbar.
Commands and flyouts can be repositioned on a toolbar. Select the com-
mand or flyout. Hold down the mouse button, drag up or down, and release
the mouse button when the splitter bar is displayed where you want the
command or flyout to be displayed.

Menus
Menus take up much less space than toolbars and contain a much wider
selection of commands when compared to toolbars. Menus are not as efficient
as toolbars because they require additional clicks to access a command, but
they do offer much greater organization. Pull-down menus support submenus,
which are like flyouts on a toolbar in that they both organize groups of simi-
lar commands. Submenus are different than flyouts because they are part of
the menu and do not rely on another menu for their content. Menus can be
displayed on the menu browser and the menu bar.
Creating a new menu
Follow this procedure to create a new menu:
1. On the ribbon, click Tools tab➪Customization panel➪User Interface.
The CUI Editor is displayed.
2. In the Customizations In pane, right-click the Menus node and choose
New Menu.
A new menu with the default name Menu1 is created under the Menus
node.
3. In the Properties pane, change the name and alias of the menu by
using the Name and Aliases boxes.
The name allows you to identify the menu and is the value displayed as
the caption of the menu when it’s displayed on the menu browser or
menu bar. The alias uniquely identifies the menu through automation or
when migrating the menu between releases.
4. In the Command List pane, add any of the commands that you want to
be displayed on the menu.
5. Click Apply to save the changes and stay in the CUI Editor, or click OK
to save the changes and exit the CUI Editor.

Using special characters with a menu item’s name
Menu item names can contain special characters to control some of the dis-
play behavior for the item. Table 3-2 lists some of the special characters that
can be used in combination with a menu item’s name.

Shortcut menus
Shortcut menus — also known as right-click or context sensitive menus —
are used to display additional options specific to the selected object(s) or
the active command or the current state of AutoCAD. Shortcut menus are
displayed by pressing the right mouse button over the drawing window and
are based on the current value of the SHORTCUTMENU system variable. By
default, the SHORTCUTMENU system variable is set to a value of 11, which
indicates to AutoCAD that it should display shortcut menus when options
are available for the active command, when no command is active and objects
are selected, or when no command is active and no objects are selected.
Shortcut menus are created much like menus for the menu browser and
menu bar with one main exception: their aliases. Most shortcut menus are
set up to work specifically with a specific command or object(s). To desig-
nate a shortcut menu to be used with a command, you use the alias syntax
of COMMAND_commandname. An example of an alias used to assign addi-
tional options to the LINE command’s right-click menu is COMMAND_LINE.
The alias is assigned to the Aliases property of the shortcut menu in the
Properties pane of the Dynamic pane.
Shortcut menus can be associated to a specific object type, and when a single
object of the designated object type is selected in the drawing window and the
right mouse button is pressed, additional options are displayed on the shortcut
menu. To designate a shortcut menu to be used when an object of a certain
type is selected, you use the alias syntax of OBJECT_objectname. Just like the
alias for a command-based shortcut menu, the alias is assigned to the Aliases
property of the shortcut menu. AutoCAD comes with many shortcut menus.
One example is the Hatch Object Menu, which uses the alias OBJECT_HATCH
to display the Hatch Edit option on the shortcut menu when a hatch object is
selected in the drawing before you press the right mouse button.
To identify the object name for an object, you can use the LIST command on
the object. The LIST command displays the object name in the AutoCAD text
window. This example shows the results of the LIST command in the
AutoCAD text window after a line was selected:
LINE      Layer: “0”
Space: Model space
Handle = 93
from point, X=  14.5169  Y=   7.9505  Z=   0.0000
to point, X=  27.3742  Y=  15.9583  Z=   0.0000
Length =  15.1471,  Angle in XY Plane =     32
Delta X =  12.8573, Delta Y =    8.0077, Delta Z =   0.0000

Chapter 3
Customizing the
Tools

The object name is listed as part of the first line of text of the returned values,
in this case, LINE. An example of an alias used to assign additional options to
the Edit shortcut menu when a line object is selected is OBJECT_LINE. If you
want to display a shortcut menu when one or more object of a specific object
type is selected, you use the alias syntax of OBJECTS_objectname.
In some instances, the object name is not used, and that is because the LIST
command returns the same object name for different conditions that an
object might have. An example of an object having multiple different condi-
tions is an insert object (or block).
Table 3-3 lists the names to be used for blocks and external reference (xref)
objects.

The Ribbon
The ribbon is an evolution of the Dashboard that was introduced in
AutoCAD 2007 and also behaves like the ribbon in Microsoft Office 2007.
With the CUI Editor, you can customize the panels and tabs that appear on
the ribbon. Ribbon panels are used to organize the display of commands and
controls, and ribbon tabs are used to group and control the display of
ribbon panels on the ribbon. You control the display of ribbon tabs through
workspaces. To find out more about the ribbon, see Book I, Chapter 3.
The ribbon in AutoCAD 2009 replaces the Dashboard.

Ribbon panels
You create and modify ribbon panels by selecting the Ribbon Panels node in
the Customizations In pane. After you expand the Ribbon Panels node, you
expand the ribbon panel you want to modify. Ribbon panels are customized
similar to toolbars, except you use rows to organize commands and controls
horizontally on a ribbon panel and you can also use subpanels to further
group commands and controls.
As you add commands and controls to a ribbon panel, you can control the
size and how the command or control is displayed. Along with commands
and controls, you can also add flyouts, which are similar to submenus on a
menu because they do not reference a toolbar like a flyout on a toolbar does.
Ribbon panels are divided into two areas, the area that is displayed by
default and the expanded area. The two areas are separated by a <PANEL
SEPARATOR> item. Figure 3-10 shows how the different elements of a ribbon
panel are shown in the CUI Editor.

Customizing Double-Click Actions
Double-click actions control what happens when you double-click an object
in the drawing window. Double-clicking objects in the drawing window
allows you to quickly access an editing command that is set up by object
name like shortcut menus are. Double-click actions require the use of an
object name to identify which command should be run when a user double-
clicks the object in the drawing window.
The object name is the value listed by the LIST command or for special
object names used for blocks and xref objects. For information on the spe-
cial object names used for blocks and xrefs, see the section “Shortcut
menus” and Table 3-3 presented previously in this chapter.

Migrating and Transferring Customization
700
Migrating and Transferring Customization
Upgrading to a new release of AutoCAD has always been a time-consuming
problem with all the customizations and settings that need to be updated.
Since AutoCAD 2005, AutoCAD has offered the Migrate Custom Settings util-
ity, which allows you to easily migrate a majority of your custom settings to
a new release.
The utility migrates only settings, profiles, and customizations located in
specific support files, and supports limited migration for menu customiza-
tion contained in the CUI files that come with AutoCAD, such as acad.cui in
AutoCAD and acadlt.cui in AutoCAD LT. To be able to migrate all customiza-
tions between two CUI files, you use the Transfer tab in the CUI Editor. The
Transfer tab allows you to migrate custom toolbars, menus, ribbon panels,
and other user interface elements between CUI files.
Transferring customizations with AutoCAD 2005 and prior versions was a
manual process: You opened two menu files with a text editor, and then
copied and pasted sections between the two files. The problem is that the
approach of copying and pasting between two files can result in missing
information or a file structure problem. The CUI Editor resolves this problem
by allowing you to graphically migrate user interface elements by dragging
and dropping them between two CUI files right in the Editor.
Follow these steps to transfer customizations from one customization file to
another and to migrate customizations from a legacy MNU or MNS file format:
1. On the ribbon, click Tools tab➪Customization panel➪User Interface.
The CUI Editor is displayed.

6. Expand the nodes of the two files and then drag and drop the user
interface elements from the pane on the right to the one on the left.
The user interface elements are added to the file, along with any com-
mands associated with the elements.
The Legacy node contains tablet, image tile, and screen menu customiza-
tion. If you’ve customized any of these sections in previous releases, don’t
forget to transfer these user interface elements too.

Working with Partial and Enterprise 
Customization Files
Partial and enterprise customization files are ways to organize and share
customization among multiple users. Whether you work in a large or small
company, you can use an enterprise customization file to share standard
company tools with all the members of your drafting team. You might add
commands to an enterprise customization file that ensure that layer and
annotation standards are followed and allow access to company title blocks.
A partial customization file can contain a subset of customization when com-
pared to the main customization file. The customization in the partial cus-
tomization file is usually personal or task-based customization. You might
use different partial customization files for different disciplines within your
company, such as civil or architectural.
Loading an enterprise customization file
Follow these steps to load an enterprise customization file:
1. Right-click the drawing window and choose Options.

any aspects of customizing AutoCAD are left untapped by most users.
Much of this is due to the many ways AutoCAD can be customized
beyond just the user interface and appearance of the application window.
AutoCAD allows you to automate repetitive tasks with standard AutoCAD
commands and command options by creating script files. AutoCAD also comes
with a set of utilities known as Express Tools that allow you to complete
tasks in AutoCAD more efficiently.
Working from a Script
No, AutoCAD will not help you land a role in Hollywood, but AutoCAD scripts
can help you be more efficient at your job. Have you ever received a set of
drawings from a client that didn’t use the same drafting settings or conform to
the CAD standards that you use? Or maybe you’ve had to manually update
older drawings to match your company’s new CAD standards? Script files can
be used for these tasks and much more.
What’s in a script?
A script is used to automate functionality in AutoCAD by using standard
AutoCAD commands, options, and AutoLISP expressions. (AutoLISP expres-
sions are not supported by AutoCAD LT, however.)
For more information on AutoLISP, see Bonus Chapter 4 on the Web, which
you can download from www.wiley.com/go/autocad2009aio.

Working from a Script
706
You create a script by using a text editor such as Notepad. After you create
the script, you save it to a plain text file with the SCR file extension, which
lets AutoCAD know that the contents of the file is a script. The structure of a
script is similar to the way AutoCAD commands and options are entered at the
command line. Here is an example of a script file that does some basic drawing
setup and demonstrates how to use comments in a script file:
; Created 12/08/07 by Lee Ambrosius
LTSCALE 24
BLIPMODE 0
LIMITS 0,0 24,17
ZOOM EXTENTS
The opening line is a comment that is ignored during the execution of the
script. Comments don’t get executed, but they can contain important infor-
mation that comes in handy when updates are needed to the script file, for
example. Comment lines begin with a semicolon; AutoCAD ignores every-
thing to the right of a semicolon.
The second line, LTSCALE 24, sets the linetype scale system variable to a
value of 24. The space between LTSCALE and the value 24 is just like pressing
the Enter key while entering values at the command prompt. AutoCAD auto-
matically issues an Enter for each new line as the script is being evaluated.
The next line, BLIPMODE 0, turns blip markers off. The line after that, LIMITS
0,0 24,17, sets the lower-left and upper-right drawing limits. The last line,
ZOOM EXTENTS, makes sure that the drawing is zoomed to its limits. At the
end of the script file, make sure that there is a single blank line to let AutoCAD
know when the script file ends.
Alternatively, commands and options can be on separate lines or on the
same line. Neither method is right or wrong. The following example shows
the same script but with commands and options on separate lines.

707
Using script files to automate repetitive tasks has both disadvantages and
advantages. Here are some of the disadvantages, just to get the negative out
of the way first:
✦There is no way to pause for user input during a command. However, if
you really need to pause for input, you can use AutoLISP.
✦Dialog boxes can’t be called during the execution of the script. To work
around this, you need to know a few more commands. For example, you
use the –LAYER command rather than the LAYER command.
✦Only a single script can be running in AutoCAD at a single time. You
can’t call another script while a script is running.
✦AutoCAD doesn’t ship with any sample scripts, which can make it diffi-
cult to get started creating your own scripts.
Here are some of the advantages:
✦The syntax is basic and can be created by anyone who can use com-
mands in AutoCAD.
✦Scripting is great for automating basic and repetitive tasks.
✦Scripts require minimal maintenance from release to release.
✦Scripts can be used transparently with AutoCAD commands.
✦AutoLISP expressions can be used in a script (if you’re not using
AutoCAD LT and know how to use AutoLISP). Using AutoLISP with your
scripts allows you to build much more complex and robust scripts.
Here are some commands specifically used for working with script files:
✦RSCRIPT: Repeats the last run script file.
✦RESUME: Continues a script that has been paused (but not paused for
input) by pressing the Escape or Backspace key during the execution of
a script. Pausing a script allows you to return to AutoCAD to perform a
set of tasks and then return to running the script again later.
✦DELAY: Pauses a script for the specified duration, which is expressed in
milliseconds. One thousand milliseconds is equal to 1 second, and the
maximum delay is a value of 32,767, which is equal to just a little longer
than 32 seconds. You might use a delay to display slides from a slide
library by using the VSLIDE command. For more information on slides
and the VSLIDE command, see AutoCAD’s online Help system.
✦SCRIPT: Loads and runs a script file through a standard Windows file
navigation dialog box.
✦–SCRIPT: Loads and runs a script file from the command prompt.

Creating a script file
Because script files are plain text files, you can create and edit them with an
application such as Notepad. Follow these steps to create a new script file
by using Notepad:
1. Choose Start➪[All] Programs➪Accessories➪Notepad.
Notepad is launched and a blank document is created.
2. On the menu bar in Notepad, choose File➪Save As.
The Save As dialog box is displayed.
3. In the File Name text box, enter a name for the script file and make
sure that you add .SCR to the end of the file name.
4. Browse to the location where you want to save the script file and click
Save.
The script file is created with the specified name and location.
5. In Notepad, enter the AutoCAD commands and options that you want
to execute when the script file is run.
Don’t forget that each command and option must be followed by a
space, unless it is the last command or option on the line. The text area
of Notepad should contain the commands and options that you want to
use in the script file.
6. On the menu bar in Notepad, choose File➪Save.
The contents of the Notepad document are saved to the script file.
Loading and running a script file
Use one of these methods to load and run a script file:
✦On the ribbon, click Tools tab➪Applications panel➪Run Script.
✦On the menu browser or menu bar, click Tools menu➪Run Script.
✦At the command prompt, type SCRIPT or SCR and press Enter.
These steps describe how to load and run a script file.
1. Start the SCRIPT command by using any of the methods just listed.
The Select Script File dialog box is displayed.
2. Browse to the location where the script file is stored and select it.
3. Click Open.
The selected script file is executed in AutoCAD.

Getting Familiar with Shapes
709
To load and run a script in an open drawing file, drag and drop the script file
from Windows Explorer onto the drawing window.
Running a script file at startup
You can load and run a script file by using one of the command line switches
with a desktop shortcut. The /b command line switch allows you to load and
run a script at startup. This can be a great way to make sure that session-
specific drafting settings are configured when AutoCAD is first launched.
Following is an example target path using the /b switch with a script file:
“C:\Program Files\AutoCAD 2009\acad.exe” /b Startup
This example starts AutoCAD with a script file named Startup. The script
file in this example must exist in the support search paths of AutoCAD. You
can also specify the absolute path for the script file as well so that the script
file does not need to be in one of AutoCAD’s support paths. See Chapter 1 in
this minibook for more information about command line switches.
Getting Familiar with Shapes
Shape files were the only way to create a blocklike object in early releases of
AutoCAD. Shapes are not as commonly used now that AutoCAD has a true
block object, but they are still used with complex linetypes and are very effi-
cient. A shape is defined through a series of lines, arcs, and circles, but these
elements are defined through a series of codes.
A shape is comprised of three components: a shape number, definition bytes,
and the shape name. The syntax of a shape as it appears in a shape file is
*shapenumber, definitionbytes, shapename
An example of a shape that looks like an equilateral triangle is
*139,5,TRIGEQ
1,013,01D,018,0
To find out more about creating shape files, refer to the “Create Shape
Definition Files” topic in the AutoCAD online Help files.
AutoCAD LT does not support the creation of shape files because it lacks the
COMPILE command. The COMPILE command is used to generate a compiled
shape file (SHX) from a shape file (SHP).

Working with Express Tools
710
Express Tools comes with a utility that allows you to make a shape out of
geometry in a drawing. This utility is great when trying to find out how to
create your own shapes. The utility can be found on the menu browser or
menu bar under Express menu➪Tools➪Make Shape. AutoCAD LT does not
support Express Tools.
Working with Express Tools
Express Tools is a collection of tools that are not part of the core AutoCAD
program. These tools are provided as-is without any type of support from
Autodesk. Many of the tools provide enhanced functionality beyond what is
in the core program or provide unique functionality to assist in certain tasks.
Slowly, over the past several releases, many of the commonly used Express
Tools have been making their way into the core program, which is great for
users of AutoCAD LT. This section provides only a brief overview of the com-
monly used tools that are still part of Express Tools. To find out more about
each of these tools, see the online Help file for Express Tools. (On the menu
browser or menu bar click Express menu➪Help.)
Express Tools is not available for AutoCAD LT, but feel free to read on to find
out about some of the tools that you may be missing out on.
Installing Express Tools
Express Tools is installed during the installation of AutoCAD. To install
Express Tools with AutoCAD, on the Review — Configure — Install page of
the AutoCAD 2009 Installation Wizard select AutoCAD 2009 from the Select a
Product to Configure drop-down list and then click Configure. Then select
the license type that you want to use on the Select the License Type page,
and click Next. On the Select the Installation Type page (see Figure 4-1), click
the Express Tools check box under Install Optional Tools — it should be
selected by default. Finish selecting the settings on the Select the Installation
Type page, and click Next. Complete the configuration and installation of
AutoCAD by clicking Configuration Complete and then clicking Install.
If you installed AutoCAD without installing Express Tools, you can use the
Control Panel in Windows to make changes to the installation by using
Uninstall or Change a Program. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Programs:
Uninstall a Program (or Programs and Features if Classic View is active). If
you’re using Windows 2000 or Windows XP, you can change AutoCAD’s
installation by using Add or Remove Programs. Choose Start➪Control
Panel➪Add or Remove Programs.

In This Chapter
 Understanding actions and Action Recorder
 Recording actions and managing action macro files
 Playing back action macro files
 Enhancing action macros with user interaction
A
lready in this minibook, you’ve discovered how to customize AutoCAD
through creating command aliases and desktop shortcuts, customizing
the user interface with the Customize User Interface (CUI) Editor, writing
scripts, and much more. Action macros are yet another form of customizing
AutoCAD, and they’re fairly easy to create when you understand the work-
flow. If you liked the idea of creating scripts to automate repetitive tasks in
Chapter 4 of this minibook, you will no doubt feel that action macro files will
be an even better choice for you. Instead of using a text editor to type the
commands and command options you want to use as you do for a script file,
you use AutoCAD to run through the series of commands that you want to
be able to use over and over again. While doing so, AutoCAD uses its Action
Recorder to take notes as to which commands and command options you’re
using and how you’re providing input for the commands.
Action Recorder is a new feature in AutoCAD 2009 that allows you to auto-
mate repetitive tasks. Like most of the different customization options avail-
able in AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT users can’t use this feature. So if you’re using
AutoCAD LT 2009, you can read through the chapter to find out what you’re
missing out on, but there’s nothing for you otherwise.
In this chapter, I take you through recording and managing action macro
files, playing them back and eventually enhancing an action macro file so it
requests user input during playback. If you haven’t come to grips with the
ribbon yet, you want to make sure that you do so and soon, as Action
Recorder lives on the ribbon in the form of a panel on the Tools tab.
Actions and Action Recorder
Anything that you do in AutoCAD, from creating or modifying objects to even
plotting a drawing, is considered an action. I know you might be confused
slightly because dynamic blocks also support actions, but if you think about

Recording and Managing Action Macros
718
it for a moment it all makes sense. Actions in a dynamic block modify objects
within the block they’re defined in, and because modifying an object is an
action, it makes sense that they’re called actions as well, right?
Even though the two types of interaction might share the term action, the
result is not the same. When I talk about actions in this chapter, I’m talking
about the input that AutoCAD collects when Action Recorder is in the record-
ing state. While Action Recorder is in the recording state, most commands and
command options used along with the input specified are collected in the form
of an action macro. Actions are the smallest element of an action macro, which
represents a command or interaction with a user interface, such as a palette or
a ribbon panel. Other input collected by Action Recorder is related to the com-
mand options or input provided during the use of a command or interaction
with a user interface element, such as a property on the Properties palette.
Recording and Managing Action Macros
As mentioned, you use Action Recorder to record actions. Recorded actions
can then be saved to an action macro file that has a file extension of ACTM,
which allows you to play back those actions at a later time. When you save
an action macro file, it’s saved to a default location on your local drive. Any
action macro files located in the default folder used to store recorded action
macros can be played back through Action Recorder.
Recording actions
You access Action Recorder from the ribbon (see Figure 5-1) on the Action
Recorder panel — conveniently named, I might add — on the Tools tab.
From the Action Recorder panel you can record, edit, and play back action
macros. After you start recording an action macro, most actions that you
perform in AutoCAD are added to the Action Tree in the form of an action
node or a value node.
Figure 5-1:
Action
Recorder —
AutoCAD’s
version of a
DVR.

Book IX
Chapter 5
Recording Your
Actions
Recording and Managing Action Macros
719
After you finish telling AutoCAD which actions should be in the action macro,
you click the Save button on the Action Recorder panel. This displays the Action
Macro dialog box (see Figure 5-2), which allows you to save the recorded
actions to an action macro file with the ACTM file extension. You can also enter
a description for the file, which is displayed in a tooltip when the cursor hovers
over the action macro’s node at the top of the Action Tree. Along with naming
an action macro and giving it a description, you can decide whether the view
prior to the start of an action macro is restored when playback of the action
macro is complete and when the action macro requests user input.
The Check for Inconsistencies when Playback Begins option has Action
Recorder check the current state of the drawing environment against the set-
tings that were in use when the action macro was recorded. Identifying if
there are differences in the settings lets you know whether there might be
potential problems with successfully playing back the action macro.
The following steps explain how to create an action macro that performs some
basic drawing setup functions. The action macro will change the linetype scale
to 24, turn off blipmode, change the drawing limits, create a nonplottable layer,
draw a rectangle, and then zoom to the extents of the drawing. It is almost iden-
tical to the example script that was shown in Chapter 1 of this minibook:
1. If the ribbon is not already displayed, type RIBBON at the command
prompt and press Enter.

2. On the ribbon, click Tools tab➪Action Recorder panel➪Record.
Action Recorder panel expands, revealing the Action Tree, and a red dot
appears near the crosshairs to indicate that AutoCAD is ready to record
commands and input.
3. At the command prompt, type LTSCALE and press Enter.
The LTSCALE system variable is started.
4. When prompted for a new scale, type 24 and press Enter.
5. At the command prompt, type BLIPMODE and press Enter.
The BLIPMODE system variable is started.

8. When prompted for the lower-left corner of the drawing limits, type 0,0
and press Enter.
Although you would normally just press Enter to accept the default value,
this can lead to issues when recording a macro. Just because the default
value is 0,0 for the lower-left corner of the drawing limits when the action
macro is recorded, don’t expect that it will be that when the action macro
is played back. So always enter the value you want to use and then press
Enter.

To stop recording and save the action macro, follow these steps:
1. On the ribbon, click Tools tab➪Action Recorder panel➪Stop.
The Action Macro dialog box is displayed.
2. In the Action Macro Command Name text box, enter a name (for example,
DrawingSetup).
The Action Macro Command Name is used for the name of the action
macro file and the command that can be used to start the action macro.
3. (Optional.) In the Description text box, enter a description.
For example, you might enter This action macro automates initial
drawing setup tasks.
4. Click OK.
The action macro is saved to the name you entered in the Action Macro
Command Name text box and the folder displayed in the Folder Path
text box. The macro is also added to the Action Macro list on the Action
Macro panel.
Although Action Recorder can capture the display of a dialog box, it doesn’t
record any of the values entered. When creating action macros, just like when
creating scripts, avoid the use of commands that display dialog boxes and in
some cases palettes. The palettes that are supported are Properties and Layer
Properties Manager, and both DesignCenter and the Tool Palettes window
offer limited support for actions that can be recorded.

For more information on recording action macros, see AutoCAD’s online
Help system. On the Contents tab, navigate to User’s Guide➪The User
Interface➪Action Macros. There are topics on recording action macros,
examples of action macros, and tips for using Action Recorder.
Managing and editing action macro files
Action Recorder not only allows you to create an action macro file and then
play it back later, but also allows you to manage the action macro files that
you’ve already created. From Action Recorder, you can manage action macro
files in the following ways:
✦Delete: Allows you to delete the action macro file. The action macro file
is not actually deleted but moved to the Recycle Bin.
✦Rename: Displays the Action Macro dialog box and allows you to change
the name or any of the other properties of the action macro.
✦Copy: Creates a copy of the action macro and displays the Action Macro
dialog box. The copy of the action macro file is not created until you
click OK.
✦Insert User Message: Displays the Insert User Message box, which
allows you to specify a text string that should be displayed when the
action macro is played back. The user message can be inserted at any
location in the action macro by selecting an action or value node before
right-clicking in the Action Tree. The user message is displayed during
playback.
✦All Points Are Relative: Converts any absolute coordinates in the action
macro to be relative to the previous point selected in the drawing. By
default the first user coordinate value in an action macro is defined as
absolute.
✦Properties: Displays the Action Macro dialog box and allows you to
change any properties of the action macro.
To manage an action macro file, select the action macro file from the Action
Macros drop-down list and then expand the Action Recorder panel by clicking
its title bar. Right-click the action macro’s node in the Action Tree and choose
one of the options available for managing the action macro file.
Managing the location of action macro files
AutoCAD uses two settings to manage action macro files. The most important
location is where Action Recorder places any action macros that you record.
The second location is where it should look for any additional action macros
that can be played back. By default, Action Recorder saves recorded action

macro files to the Actions folder, which can be found in one of the following
locations based on the operating system you’re using:
✦Windows XP: <drive>:\Documents and Settings\<username>\
Application Data\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2009\R17.2\enu\Support\Actions
✦Windows Vista:
<drive>:\Users\<username>\AppData\Autodesk\AutoCAD
2009\R17.2\enu\Support\Actions
You use the Options dialog box to change the default location used to store
recorded action macro files and where AutoCAD can find other action
macros for playback. In the Options dialog box, click the Files tab and
expand the Action Recorder Settings node to reveal the file locations used
for recording and playing back action macro files. Expand the Actions
Recording File Location node to see the current location used for storing
recorded action macro files. Select the path and click Browse to specify a dif-
ferent location that newly recorded action macro files should be saved to.
When you click Browse, the Browse to Folder dialog box is displayed, allow-
ing you to select a different location. Click OK to use the selected path.
Expand the Additional Actions Reading File Locations node to see the addi-
tional locations that Action Recorder looks for action macro files, and then
click Add to add a new location to the node. To update an existing location,
select the path and click Browse. You use the Browse to Folder dialog box to
add or update a location. If you plan on sharing the action macros you
record, it’s best to place the ACTM files in a network location and then add
the location to the Additional Actions Reading File Locations node.
Editing Actions and Recorded Values
After an action macro has been recorded and saved, you can edit the
recorded actions or values to achieve the desired results and insert requests
for user input. You can edit a recorded action and value by right-clicking one
of the nodes that represents a recorded action or value in the Action tree.
You can edit a recorded action and value in the following ways:
✦Insert User Message: Displays the Insert User Message box, which
allows you to specify a text string that should be displayed when the
action macro is played back. The user message can be inserted at any
location in the action macro by first selecting an action or value node
before right-clicking in the Action Tree. The user message is displayed
during playback.

Just Press Play
724
✦Request User Input: Allows you to have the user provide a value in
response to a value node when the action macro is played back. The
user has the option to provide input or use the value that was recorded
with the action macro.
✦Edit: Allows you to edit the current value of a value node.
✦Relative to Previous: Allows you to toggle a coordinate value that was
provided as an absolute value to be relative to the previous coordinate
value recorded in the action macro. All coordinate values are captured
as absolute, but all coordinates other than the first are played back as
relative to the previous point by default.
✦Delete: Allows you to delete a recorded action. Only actions can be
deleted; you can’t delete a value node that is used by an action.
✦Use Pick First Set: Uses the objects selected prior to the playback of the
action macro. The PICKFIRST system variable must be set to 1; other-
wise, the objects selected are deselected prior to the playback of the
action macro and you are prompted to select objects during playback
instead.
✦Macro-Created Object Selection: Selects any objects that are created
during the playback of the action macro.
✦Re-specify New Selection Set: You are prompted to select a new selec-
tion set of objects during playback.
For more information on editing and working with different types of actions
and value nodes, see AutoCAD’s online Help system and use the Index tab to
look up Action Macros, Node Icons.
Just Press Play
After you record an action macro file, set up the recorded value nodes as
desired, and add any necessary user messages, you’re ready to play back the
action macro in a new or existing drawing. To play back a recorded action
macro, you select the action macro that you want to play back from the
Action Macros drop-down list and then click Play.
If a recorded value has been changed to request user input during playback,
you’ll be presented with the ability to provide user input in the form of a
value that you enter at the command prompt, specify a point in the drawing
window, or select objects. You can also play back the action macro based on
its recorded value, or abort playback if you’re prompted for user input
during playback.

Book IX
Chapter 5
Recording Your
Actions
Just Press Play
725
Along with being presented with a request for user input, you might also be
presented with a user message that informs you of what the action macro
might do or what settings are required to successfully play back the action
macro. Click Yes to continue playing back the action macro or No to abort
the playback.
When AutoCAD finds an action macro in one of the specified locations under
the Action Recorder Settings node on the Files tab of the Options dialog box,
AutoCAD automatically sets up a command with the same name as the
action macro, as long as a command with the same name is not already
defined. Just like any other command in AutoCAD, you can type its name at
the command line to start it. So entering the name of an action macro at the
command prompt plays back that action macro.
