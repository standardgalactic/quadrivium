Introduction
S
o you want to play guitar, eh? No one can blame you. The guitar isn’t just a 
beautiful, soulful, and versatile instrument. For about 75 years now, it has 
also set the standard for coolness in the music world. Not a bad combination!
Though the guitar as we know it is only about a century and a half old, its 
roots as a plucked stringed instrument go back deep into history. Many 
ancient folk instruments have followed the basic strings-stretched-over-
fretboard-and-played-with-fingers design for thousands of years, and the 
guitar is in some ways the culmination of that legacy. It seems humans have 
always had something like the guitar in mind.
After the guitar was electrified in the 1930s — that is, when it went from soft 
backup instrument to a forceful and expressive vehicle for soloing — its 
popularity skyrocketed, and its intrinsic qualities and sound changed popular 
music forever. But its softer side didn’t go away. When Bob Dylan famously 
“plugged in” at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival and was booed by outraged folk 
fans, it became clear that the electric guitar had entered its own universe.
Guitar All-in-One For Dummies covers both the acoustic and the electric 
universes — as well as the older classical guitar one, which has its own 
language, techniques, and musical pedigree.
About This Book
First, here’s what this book is not: It’s not a textbook, nor a long-winded his-
tory, nor a rote learning tool. Lots of those kinds of books are on the market, 
if that’s what you’re looking for — but beware, they are often dry and assume 
underlying knowledge.
Guitar All-in-One For Dummies is a generous conglomeration of material from 
several For Dummies guitar and music books. It aims to cover the guitar 
gamut, from what those thingies are called that wind the strings (tuning 
machines) to how Stevie Ray Vaughan got his incredible sound (by tuning 
lower, among other tricks) to which chords just plain sound good together 
when writing songs (depends — see Chapter 4 in Book VII).

2
Guitar All-in-One For Dummies 
Much of the material is relevant to any style of guitar playing. But three 
popular guitar genres each get their own book: rock guitar, blues guitar, and 
classical guitar. You also find chapters on learning to read music, on building 
your chord repertoire, on amps, scales, songwriting . . . let’s just say there’s a 
lot here. And don’t forget the CD!
Conventions Used in This Book
Important words are defined in italics. Key words in lists that bring important 
ideas to your attention are in bold. And all Web addresses are in monofont 
to set them apart.
Here are a few other conventions to help you navigate this book:
 
 Right hand and left hand: Instead of using “strumming hand” and “fret-
ting hand,” this book uses “right hand” for the hand that picks or strums 
the strings and “left hand” for the hand that frets the strings (it’s easier 
and shorter that way). Sincere apologies to those left-handed readers 
who are using this book; you folks should read “right hand” to mean “left 
hand” and vice versa.
 
 Up and down, higher and lower, and so on: If you’re asked to move 
a note or chord up the guitar neck or to play it higher on the neck, it 
means higher in pitch, or toward the body of the guitar. If you’re asked 
to go down or lower on the neck, it means toward the headstock, or 
lower in pitch. (Those of you who hold your guitar with the headstock 
tilted upward may need to do a bit of mental adjustment whenever you 
see these terms. Just remember that these terms are about pitch, not 
position, and you’ll do just fine.)
 
 Dual music notation: Songs and exercises are arranged with the stan-
dard music staff on top and the tablature staff below. You can use either 
of these methods, but you don’t need to look at both at the same time. In 
many cases, the music under scrutiny also is on the CD, so look for black 
boxes that point you to specific tracks on the CD and then follow along.
What You’re Not to Read
There are many sidebars (in shaded gray boxes) in this book that you don’t 
really need to read in order to follow the chapter text. They contain extra 
information or background stories and history that you may be interested in, 
or not. Feel free to skip anything marked with the Technical Stuff icon, too.

 Introduction
Foolish Assumptions
Guitar All-in-One For Dummies doesn’t assume you know anything about play-
ing guitar or reading music. It starts from zero and builds from the ground 
up — and then keeps going and going. It contains straightforward, informal 
explanations of how guitars work, what the different kinds are, how to get 
started playing, how to form chords and strum and fingerpick, and then pro-
ceeds to help deepen your knowledge in several directions.
This book is designed for just about anyone who loves guitar. It is as useful for 
people who have barely touched a guitar as it is for those who have fiddled 
around with one for years but would like to get more serious. Even advanced 
players — such as those who would like to try a different genre than they’re 
used to, or who specifically need to work on, say, their outside chord inver-
sion patterns — will find plenty of valuable information in these pages.
No matter your situation, experience, or motives, this book’s goal is to give you 
enough information so that ultimately you can explore the guitar on your own. 
Discovering what the instrument can do, finding ways to make new sounds, 
suddenly grasping a better way to fret notes or chords that just minutes ago 
seemed impossible — these are tremendously exciting and satisfying experi-
ences. Such magic awaits you if you’re willing to put in some time and effort.
How This Book Is Organized
Guitar All-in-One For Dummies is sorted into eight books so you can find what 
you need to know quickly.
Book I: Guitar 101
The first book begins with the basics by looking at how guitars are con-
structed, what the different parts are, and how to go about acquiring a guitar 
that suits your style and budget. The mechanics of getting up and running 
are covered here, such as stringing and tuning the instrument, and the basic 
how-to of playing it. A chapter in this book also tackles reading music — a 
skill which isn’t required to play guitar, but is helpful in many ways.
Book II: Sounds and Techniques
This book gets you going in playing guitar, starting with basic major and 
minor chords. Did you know you can play probably half of the most famous 
songs ever by knowing just three or four chords? It’s true. Of course, after 

4
Guitar All-in-One For Dummies 
you get a taste of E minor, you’re going to want to try E7 . . . and that’s how 
you get hooked. This book also discusses strumming, plucking, and picking 
techniques. By the time you finish this book, you should have all the knowl-
edge you need to play, in basic form, loads and loads of songs on guitar.
Book III: Rock Guitar
Nowadays, when people think of a guitar, they usually picture someone in 
tight pants and insufficiently trimmed hair coaxing unholy sounds out of it. 
That’s because rock ’n’ roll really brought the guitar to the forefront of popu-
lar culture, beginning in the middle of the last century. This book focuses 
on All Things Rock: the nitty-gritty of amplifiers, playing hot licks and sweet 
leads, and checking out just how the greatest guitar heroes do what they 
do. From Chuck Berry to Keith Richards, from Jimi Hendrix to The Edge, this 
book is your key to unlocking what makes rock guitar so exciting.
Book IV: Blues Guitar
A basic guitar is cheap to buy (or make), and it’s perfect for strumming while 
you sing — which meant it was the ideal instrument for African Americans 
to entertain themselves and their neighbors in the rural South during hard 
times. The result: a unique musical genre that’s as full of emotion and pas-
sion as it is easy to play. But the blues didn’t stop at the porch — it migrated 
to various parts of the U.S. (and eventually Great Britain and elsewhere) and 
developed into many distinct styles. It also helped birth rock ’n’ roll. This 
book explores all aspects of the blues, from picking styles to signature riffs, 
from the evolution of different song forms to the achievements of the great 
blues guitarists in history.
Book V: Classical Guitar
The other iconic image of a guitar player is a romantic-looking fellow, seated 
and holding a humble acoustic guitar, playing gorgeous and complicated 
instrumental music. This book makes it clear that rock and blues are the new 
kids on the block. Classical guitar figured out early on that the great Baroque, 
Classical, and Romantic compositions weren’t just for violin and cello after 
all. This book delves into the history and development of classical guitar, 
both as an instrument and a style. It contains lots of music to play, too, 
including standards that are surprisingly easy to play and more challenging, 
complex pieces that vividly separate the virtuosos from the noodlers.

 Introduction
Book VI: Exercises: Practice, 
Practice, Practice
How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice, and lots of it, is the only way you’ll 
ever stand on stage with confidence, poised to amaze and delight a crowd. 
Many guitarists find that after several months or even years of playing, their 
abilities plateau — they don’t get worse, but they don’t get better. They have 
reached stasis in their playing. And that may be fine, depending on commit-
ment level. But at that point, one sure-fire way to keep improving is to repeat-
edly work the fingers through rigorous practice exercises. In this book you 
find lots and lots of moderate and advanced scales, chords, and arpeggio 
training designed to correct deficiencies and rev up stalled skills.
Book VII: Writing Songs and Music
Picking up a guitar and playing songs and compositions written by your 
favorite artists is fun, no question about it. But there may well come a point 
when you feel the urge to contribute something original of your own. How 
exactly do you go about that? Well, you could stumble around trying out 
random chords as you think up things that rhyme (please don’t rhyme “fire” 
with “desire” again, okay, please?) — or you could approach the challenge 
armed with some wisdom from people who do it for a living. It turns out that 
writing songs is both an art and a science. This book is chock-full of tips and 
tricks to use when writing music, such as using the inherent melodies in 
scales and chords and putting chords together in proven progressions that 
evoke precisely the mood and feeling you’re after.
Book VIII: Appendixes
Guitar All-in-One For Dummies ends with the Mother of All Guitar Chord 
Charts — a reference that should come in mighty handy when trying to recall 
how to form E%dim7 — and an appendix on using the CD.

Where to Go from Here
Where to go depends on your level of skill. You may as well start with 
Chapter 1 in Book I if you know nothing about guitars, to lay a solid founda-
tion for what comes later — after all, if you don’t know what we’re talking 
about later on, the book isn’t of much use. If you have a little experience with 
guitar, try beginning with Book II for a brush-up on the basics and then move 
on from there. If you know guitar basics but are interested in finally trying to 
read music, head straight to Chapter 4 in Book I.
If you’re already okay on guitar, and you know how to do things like form 7th 
chords and use a pick to make a controlled, bouncy rhythm, head to the chap-
ters in the book about your favorite genre and dive in — Books III, IV, and V. We 
guarantee you’ll learn something new and probably encounter some challenges.
If you’re already a good guitar player, well . . . the thing is, you know in your 
heart you’re not as good as you could be. Make for Book VI to really give 
those fingers a workout. And if you have the flickering of a new song in your 
heart, first find a voice recorder (or pen and paper if you can write music) 
and record your idea while it’s still in your head. Then head to Book VII to 
check out a ton of ideas on how to develop your soon-to-be hit song.
All right then — it’s time to get going. Good luck and much success in your 
playing!

A
ll guitars — whether painted purple with airbrushed skulls and light-
ning bolts or finished in a natural-wood pattern with a fine French 
lacquer — share certain physical characteristics that make them behave 
like guitars and not violins or tubas. If you’re confused about the difference 
between a headstock and a pickup, this chapter is for you. It describes the 
differences among the various parts of the guitar, tells you what those parts 
do, and explains why the guitar sounds the way it does.
This chapter also describes several different methods to get your guitar in 
tune. Tuning is to guitarists what parallel parking is to city drivers: an every-
day and necessary activity that can be vexingly difficult to master. And the 
task is never fun. Unlike the piano, which a professional tunes and can’t be 
adjusted until the next time the professional tuner comes to visit, the guitar 
is normally tuned by its owner — and it needs constant adjusting.
The Anatomy of a Guitar
Guitars come in two basic flavors: acoustic and electric. From a hardware stand-
point, electric guitars have more components and doohickeys than do acoustic 
guitars. Guitar makers generally agree, however, that making an acoustic guitar 
is harder than making an electric guitar. That’s why, pound for pound, acoustic 
guitars cost just as much or more than their electric counterparts.

10
Book I: Guitar 101 
Acoustic and electric guitars have very similar constructions, despite a some-
times radical difference in tone production (unless, of course, you think that 
Segovia and Metallica are indistinguishable). Figures 1-1 and 1-2 show the 
various parts of an acoustic and electric guitar.

Here are the functions of the various parts of a guitar:
 
 Back (acoustic only): The part of the body that holds the sides in place; 
made of two or three pieces of wood.
 
 Bar (electric only): A metal rod attached to the bridge that varies the 
string tension by tilting the bridge back and forth. Also called the trem-
olo bar, whammy bar, vibrato bar, and wang bar.
 
 Body: The box that provides an anchor for the neck and bridge and 
creates the playing surface for the right hand. On an acoustic, the body 
includes the amplifying sound chamber that produces the guitar’s tone. 
On an electric, it consists of the housing for the bridge assembly and 
electronics (pickups as well as tone and volume controls).
 
 Bridge: The metal (electric) or wooden (acoustic) plate that anchors the 
strings to the body.

11
 Chapter 1: Guitar Anatomy and Tuning
Book I
Guitar 101
 
 End pin: A metal post where the rear end of the strap connects. On 
acoustic-electrics (acoustic guitars with built-in pickups and electronics), 
the pin often doubles as the output jack where you plug in.
 
 Fingerboard: A flat, plank-like piece of wood that sits atop the neck, 
where you place your left-hand fingers to produce notes and chords. 
The fingerboard is also known as the fretboard, because the frets are 
embedded in it.
 
 Frets: Thin metal wires or bars running perpendicular to the strings that 
shorten the effective vibrating length of a string, enabling it to produce 
different pitches.
 
 Headstock: The section that holds the tuning machines and provides a 
place for the manufacturer to display its logo. Not to be confused with 
Woodstock, a famous upstate New York concert in 1969.
 
 Neck: The long, clublike wooden piece that connects the headstock to 
the body.
 
 Nut: A grooved sliver of stiff nylon, brass, bone, or other synthetic 
substance that stops the strings from vibrating beyond the neck. The 
strings pass through the grooves on their way to the tuners in the head-
stock. The nut is one of the two points at which the vibrating area of the 
string ends. (The other is the bridge.)
 
 Output jack (electric only): The insertion point for the cord that con-
nects the guitar to an amplifier or other electronic device.
 
 Pickup selector (electric only): A switch that determines which pickups 
are currently active.
 
 Pickups (electric only): Barlike magnets that create the electrical cur-
rent, which the amplifier converts into musical sound.
 
 Sides (acoustic only): Separate curved wooden pieces on the body that 
join the top to the back.
 
 Strap pin: Metal post where the front, or top, end of the strap connects. 
(Note that not all acoustics have a strap pin. If the guitar is missing one, 
tie the top of the strap around the headstock.)
 
 Strings: The six metal (for electric and steel-string acoustic guitars) 
or nylon (for classical guitars) wires that, drawn taut, produce the 
notes. Although not strictly part of the actual guitar — you attach and 
remove them at will on top of the guitar — strings are an integral part 
of the whole system, and a guitar’s entire design and structure revolves 
around making the strings ring out with a joyful noise. (You can find out 
more about strings and tuning later in this chapter.)
 
 Top: The face of the guitar. On an acoustic, this piece is also the sound-
ing board, which produces almost all the guitar’s acoustic qualities. On 
an electric, the top is merely a cosmetic or decorative cap that overlays 
the rest of the body material.

12
Book I: Guitar 101 
 
 Tuning machines: Geared mechanisms that raise and lower the tension 
of the strings, drawing them to different pitches. The string wraps tightly 
around a post that sticks out through the top, or face, of the headstock. 
The post passes through to the back of the headstock, where gears con-
nect it to a tuning key. Also known as tuners, tuning pegs, tuning keys, 
and tuning gears.
 
 Volume and tone controls (electric only): Knobs that vary the loudness 
of the guitar’s sound and its bass and treble frequencies.

How Guitars Work
After you can recognize the basic parts of the guitar, you may also want 
to understand how those parts work together to make sound (in case you 
happen to choose the “Parts of a Guitar” category on Jeopardy! or get into 
a heavy argument with another guitarist about string vibration and string 
length). This information is presented so you know why your guitar sounds 
the way it does, instead of like a kazoo or an accordion. The important thing 
to remember is that a guitar makes the sound, but you make the music.

13
 Chapter 1: Guitar Anatomy and Tuning
Book I
Guitar 101
String vibration and string length
Any instrument must have some part of it moving in a regular, repeated motion 
to produce musical sound (a sustained tone, or pitch). In a guitar, this part is 
the vibrating string. A string that you bring to a certain tension and then set in 
motion (by a plucking action) produces a predictable sound — for example, 
the note A. If you tune a string of your guitar to different tensions, you get dif-
ferent tones. The greater the tension of a string, the higher the pitch.
You couldn’t do very much with a guitar, however, if the only way to change 
pitches was to frantically adjust the tension on the strings every time you 
pluck a string. So guitarists resort to the other way to change a string’s pitch: 
shortening its effective vibrating length by fretting — pacing back and forth 
and mumbling to themselves. Just kidding; guitarists never do that kind of 
fretting unless they haven’t held their guitars for a couple of days. In guitar-
speak, fretting refers to pushing the string against the fretboard so it vibrates 
only between the fingered fret and the bridge. This way, by fretting the left 
hand up and down the neck (toward the bridge and the nut, respectively), 
you can change pitches comfortably and easily.
 
The fact that smaller instruments such as mandolins and violins are higher in 
pitch than are cellos and basses (and guitars, for that matter) is no accident. 
Their pitch is higher because their strings are shorter. The string tension of 
all of these instruments may be closely related, making them feel somewhat 
consistent in response to the hands and fingers, but the drastic difference in 
string lengths results in the wide differences of pitch among them. This prin-
ciple holds true in animals, too. A Chihuahua has a higher-pitched bark than 
a Saint Bernard because its strings — er, vocal cords — are much shorter.
Using both hands to make a sound
The guitar normally requires two hands working together to create music. 
If you want to play, say, middle C on the piano, all you do is take your index 
finger, position it above the appropriate white key under the piano’s logo, 
and press it down: donnnng. A preschooler can sound just like Vladimir 
Horowitz if playing only middle C, because just one finger of one hand, press-
ing one key, makes the sound.
The guitar is somewhat different. To play middle C on the guitar, you take 
your left-hand index finger and fret the 2nd string — that is, the 2nd string 
counting from the bottom as you hold the guitar — at the 1st fret. This 
action, however, doesn’t produce a sound. You must also strike or pluck that 
2nd string with your right hand to audibly produce the note middle C.

14
Book I: Guitar 101 
 
Music readers take note: The guitar sounds an octave lower than its written 
notes. For example, playing a written, third-space C on the guitar actually 
produces a middle C.
Frets and half steps
The smallest interval (unit of musical difference in pitch) of the musical scale 
is the half step. On the piano, every adjacent key is a half step apart, regard-
less of whether it’s black or white. To proceed by half steps on a keyboard 
instrument, you move your finger up or down to the next available key. On 
the guitar, frets represent these half steps. To go up or down by half steps on 
a guitar means to move your left hand one fret at a time, higher or lower on 
the neck.
Pickups
Vibrating strings produce the different tones on a guitar. But you must be 
able to hear those tones, or you face one of those if-a-tree-falls-in-a-forest 
questions. For an acoustic guitar, that’s no problem, because an acoustic 
instrument provides its own amplifier in the form of the hollow sound cham-
ber that boosts its sound . . . well, acoustically.
But an electric guitar makes virtually no acoustic sound at all. (Well, a tiny 
bit, like a buzzing mosquito, but nowhere near enough to fill a stadium or 
anger your next-door neighbors.) An electric instrument creates its tones 
entirely through electronic means. The vibrating string is still the source of 
the sound, but a hollow wood chamber isn’t what makes those vibrations 
audible. Instead, the vibrations disturb, or modulate, the magnetic field that 
the pickups — wire-wrapped magnets positioned underneath the strings — 
produce. As the vibrations of the strings modulate the pickup’s magnetic 
field, the pickup produces a tiny electric current that exactly reflects that 
modulation.
 
If you remember from eighth-grade science, wrapping wire around a magnet 
creates a small current in the wire. If you then take any magnetic substance 
and disturb the magnetic field around that wire, you create fluctuations in 
the current itself. A taut steel string vibrating at the rate of 440 times per 
second creates a current that fluctuates 440 times per second. Pass that cur-
rent through an amplifier and then a speaker and — voilà — you hear the 
musical tone A. More specifically, you hear the A above middle C, which is 
the standard absolute tuning reference in modern music — from the New 
York Philharmonic to the Rolling Stones to Metallica (although we’ve heard 
that Metallica sometimes uses a tuning reference of 666 — oh no, wait, that 
was Iron Maiden). You find out more about tuning later in this chapter.

15
 Chapter 1: Guitar Anatomy and Tuning
Book I
Guitar 101
 
Guitars, therefore, make sound either by amplifying string vibrations acousti-
cally by passing the sound waves through a hollow chamber, or electronically 
by amplifying and outputting a current through a speaker. That’s the physical 
process anyway. How a guitar produces different sounds — and the ones that 
you want it to make — is up to the way you control the pitches that those 
strings produce. Left-hand fretting is what changes these pitches. Your right-
hand motions not only help produce the sound by setting the string in 
motion, they also determine the rhythm (the beat or pulse), tempo (the speed 
of the music), and feel (interpretation, style, spin, magic, mojo, je ne sais 
quoi, whatever) of those pitches. Put both hand motions together and they 
spell guitar music.
Counting Your Strings and Frets
One of the great injustices of life is that, before you can even play music on 
the guitar, you must endure the painstaking process of getting your instru-
ment in tune. Fortunately for guitarists, you have only six strings as opposed 
to a few hundred in a piano. Before you can tune your guitar, you need to 
know how to refer to the two main players — strings and frets.
 
 Strings: Strings are numbered consecutively 1 through 6. The 1st string 
is the skinniest, located closest to the floor when you hold the guitar in 
playing position. (See Chapter 2 in Book 1 for details on playing posi-
tions.) Working your way up, the 6th string is the fattest, closest to the 
ceiling. This may seem counterintuitive, because when you look down 
at the strings, the first one you see is actually the 6th string, not the 1st. 
There’s nothing to be done about this except remember it.
 
 It’s a good idea to memorize the note names of the open strings (E, A, D, 
G, B, E, from 6th to 1st) so you’re not limited to referring to them by 
number. An easy way to memorize the open strings in order is to 
remember the phrase “Eddie Ate Dynamite; Good-Bye, Eddie.”
 
 Frets: Frets can refer to either the spaces where you put your left-hand 
finger or to the thin metal bars embedded in the fingerboard. Whenever 
you deal with guitar fingering, fret means the space in between the metal 
bars — where you can comfortably fit a left-hand finger.
 
 The 1st fret is the region between the nut (the thin, grooved strip that 
separates the headstock from the neck) and the first metal bar. The 5th 
fret, then, is the fifth square up from the nut — technically, the region 
between the fourth and fifth metal fret bars.
 
 Most guitars have a marker on the 5th fret, either a decorative design 
embedded in the fingerboard or a dot on the side of the neck, or both.
You can always check out the diagram on the Cheat Sheet at the front of the 
book while you get comfortable with these naming conventions.

16
Book I: Guitar 101 
 
One more point of business to square away. You’ll come across the terms 
open strings and fretted strings from this point on in the book:
 
 Open string: A string that you play without fretting it at all.
 
 Fretted string: A string that you play while pressing down on it at a 
particular fret.
Everything’s Relative: Tuning 
the Guitar to Itself
Relative tuning is so named because you don’t need any outside reference 
to which you tune the instrument. As long as the strings are in tune in a cer-
tain relationship with each other, you can create sonorous and harmonious 
tones. Those same tones may turn into sounds resembling those of a catfight 
if you try to play along with another instrument, however; but as long as you 
tune the strings relative to one another, the guitar is in tune with itself.
To tune a guitar using the relative method, choose one string as the starting 
point — say, the 6th string. Leave the pitch of that string as is; then tune all 
the other strings relative to that 6th string.
The 5th-fret method derives its name from the fact that you almost always 
play a string at the 5th fret and then compare the sound of that note to that 
of the next open string. You need to be careful, however, because the 4th fret 
(the 5th fret’s jealous understudy) puts in a cameo appearance toward the 
end of the process.
Here’s how to get your guitar in tune by using the 5th-fret method (check out 
Figure 1-3, which outlines all five steps):
 
1. Play the 5th fret of the 6th (low E) string, which is the fattest one, 
closest to the ceiling, and then play the open 5th (A) string, the one 
next to it.
 
 Let both notes ring together. Their pitches should match exactly. If they 
don’t seem quite right, determine whether the 5th string is higher or 
lower than the fretted 6th string.
 
• If the 5th string seems lower, or flat, turn its tuning key to raise the 
pitch.
 
• If the 5th string seems sharp, or higher sounding, use its tuning key 
to lower the pitch.

17
 Chapter 1: Guitar Anatomy and Tuning
Book I
Guitar 101
 
 You may go too far with the tuning key if you’re not careful; if so, you 
need to reverse your motions. In fact, if you can’t tell whether the 5th 
string is higher or lower, tune it flat intentionally (that is, tune it too low) 
and then come back to the desired pitch.
 
2. Play the 5th fret of the 5th (A) string and then play the open 4th (D) 
string.
 
 Let both of these notes ring together. If the 4th string seems flat or sharp 
relative to the fretted 5th string, use the tuning key of the 4th string to 
adjust its pitch accordingly. Again, if you’re not sure whether the 4th 
string is higher or lower, “overtune” it in one direction — flat, or lower, 
is best — and then come back.
 
3. Play the 5th fret of the 4th (D) string and then play the open 3rd (G) 
string.
 
 Let both notes ring together again. If the 3rd string seems flat or sharp 
relative to the fretted 4th string, use the tuning key of the 3rd string to 
adjust the pitch accordingly.
 
4. Play the FOURTH (not the 5th!) fret of the 3rd (G) string and then play 
the open 2nd (B) string.
 
 Let both strings ring together. If the 2nd string seems flat or sharp, use 
its tuning key to adjust the pitch accordingly.
 
5. Play the 5th (yes, back to the 5th for this one) fret of the 2nd (B) string 
and then play the open 1st (high E) string.
 
 Let both notes ring together. If the 1st string seems flat or sharp, use its 
tuning key to adjust the pitch accordingly. If you’re satisfied that both 
strings produce the same pitch, you’ve now tuned the upper (that is, 
“upper” as in higher-pitched) five strings of the guitar relative to the 
fixed (untuned) 6th string. Your guitar’s now in tune with itself.

Book I: Guitar 101 
 
When you tune in the normal way, you use your left hand to turn the tuning 
peg. But after you remove your finger from the string that you’re fretting, it 
stops ringing; therefore, you can no longer hear the string you’re trying to tune 
to (the fretted string) as you adjust the open string. However, there’s a way to 
tune the open string while keeping your left-hand finger on the fretted string: 
Simply use your right hand! After you strike the two strings in succession (the 
fretted string and the open string), take your right hand and reach over your 
left hand (which remains stationary as you fret the string) and turn the tuning 
key of the appropriate string until both strings sound exactly the same.
In Deference to a Reference: 
Tuning to a Fixed Source
Getting the guitar in tune with itself through the relative method in the pre-
ceding section is good for your ear, but isn’t very practical if you need to play 
with other instruments or voices that are accustomed to standard tuning 
references. If you want to bring your guitar into the world of other people, 
you need to know how to tune to a fixed source, such as a piano, pitch pipe, 
tuning fork, or electronic tuner. Using such a source ensures that everyone 
is playing by the same tuning rules. Besides, your guitar and strings are built 
for optimal tone production if you tune to standard pitch.
The following sections describe some typical ways to tune your guitar by 
using fixed references. These methods not only enable you to get in tune, but 
also to make nice with the other instruments in the neighborhood.
Taking a turn at the piano
Because it holds its pitch so well (needing only biannual or annual tunings, 
depending on the conditions), a piano is a great tool for tuning a guitar. 
Assuming that you have an electronic keyboard or a well-tuned piano around, 
all you need to do is match the open strings of the guitar to the appropriate 
keys on the piano. Figure 1-4 shows a piano keyboard and the corresponding 
open guitar strings.
Tuning your guitar with a pitch pipe
Obviously, if you’re off to the beach with your guitar, you’re not going to 
want to put a piano in the back of your car, even if you’re really fussy about 
tuning. So you need a smaller and more practical device that supplies 

19
 Chapter 1: Guitar Anatomy and Tuning
Book I
Guitar 101
standard-tuning reference pitches. Enter the pitch pipe. The pitch pipe may 
evoke images of stern, matronly chorus leaders who purse their prunelike 
lips around a circular harmonica to deliver a sharp squeak that instantly mar-
shals together the reluctant voices of the choir — yet it does serve a worthy 
purpose.
For guitarists, special pitch pipes exist consisting of pipes that play only the 
notes of the open strings of the guitar (but sounding in a higher range) and 
none of the in-between notes. The advantage of a pitch pipe is that you can 
hold it firmly in your mouth while blowing, keeping your hands free for tuning. 
The disadvantage to a pitch pipe is that you sometimes take a while getting 
used to hearing a wind-produced pitch against a struck-string pitch. But with 
practice, you can tune with a pitch pipe as easily as you can with a piano.

Sinking your teeth into the tuning fork
After you get good enough at discerning pitches, you need only one single-
pitched tuning reference to get your whole guitar in tune. The tuning fork 
offers only one pitch, and it usually comes in only one flavor: A (the one 
above middle C, which vibrates at 440 cycles per second, commonly known 
as A-440). But that note’s really all you need. If you tune your open 5th string 
(A) to the tuning fork’s A (although the guitar’s A sounds in a lower octave), 
you can tune every other string to that string by using the relative tuning 
method outlined earlier in this chapter.
Using a tuning fork requires a little finesse. You must strike the fork against 
something firm, such as a tabletop or kneecap, and then hold it close to your 
ear or place the stem or handle — not the tines or fork prongs — against 
something that resonates. This resonator can be the tabletop again or even 
the top of the guitar. (You can even hold it between your teeth, which leaves 
your hands free! It really works!) At the same time, you must somehow play 
an A note and tune it to the fork’s tone. The process is kinda like pulling your 
house keys out of your pocket while you’re loaded down with an armful of 
groceries. The task may not be easy, but if you do it enough, you eventually 
become an expert.
Experiencing the electronic tuner
 
The quickest, most accurate way to get your guitar in tune is to employ an 
electronic tuner. This handy device seems to possess witchcraft-like powers. 
Newer electronic tuners made especially for guitars can usually sense what 
string you’re playing, tell you what pitch you’re nearest, and indicate 
whether you’re flat (too low) or sharp (too high). About the only thing these 
devices don’t do is turn the tuning keys for you (although we hear they’re 
working on that). Some older, graph-type tuners feature a switch that selects 
which string you want to tune. Figure 1-5 shows a typical electronic tuner.
You can either plug your electric guitar into the tuner or use the tuner’s built-
in microphone to tune an acoustic. In both types of tuners — the ones where 
you select the strings and the ones that automatically sense the string — the 
display indicates two things: what note you’re closest to (E, A, D, G, B, E) and 
whether you’re flat or sharp of that note.
Electronic tuners are usually powered by 9-volt batteries or two AAs that can 
last for a year with regular usage (up to two or even three years with only 
occasional usage). Many electronic tuners are inexpensive (as low as $20 or 
so) and are well worth the money.

Using your CD
Lest we forget, you have one more fixed source as a tuning reference: your 
Guitar All-in-One For Dummies CD.
For your tuning convenience, the open strings are played on Track 1 of the 
audio CD that comes with this book. Listen to the tone of each open string as 
they sound slowly, one at a time (from the 1st to the 6th, or skinniest/highest 
to fattest/lowest) and tune your guitar’s open strings to those on the CD. Use 
the track skip button on the CD player to go back to the beginning of Track 1 
to repeat the tuning notes as often as necessary to get your strings exactly in 
tune with the strings on the CD.
Unlike a cassette tape — or any analog tape system, for that matter — a CD 
always plays back the exact pitch that it records and never goes sharp or flat, 
not even a little bit. So you can use your For Dummies CD on any CD player at 
any time to get perfectly tuned notes.

G
uitars are user-friendly instruments. They fit comfortably into the arms 
of most humans, and the way your two hands fall on the strings naturally 
is pretty much the position in which you should play. In this chapter, you find 
out all about good posture techniques and how to hold your hands — just as if 
you were a young socialite at a finishing school.
We jest because we care. But you really do need to remember that good pos-
ture and position, at the very least, prevent strain and fatigue and, at best, 
help develop good concentration habits and tone. After you’re positioned 
correctly with the guitar, you read about some basic music-deciphering skills 
and get the chance to play your very first chord.
Hand Position and Posture
You can either sit or stand while playing the guitar, and the position you 
choose makes virtually no difference whatsoever to your tone or technique. 
Most people prefer to practice while sitting but perform publicly while stand-
ing. The one exception to the sit or stand option is the classical guitar, which 
you normally play in a sitting position. This practice doesn’t mean that you 
can’t play a classical-style guitar or classical music while standing, but the 
serious pursuit of the classical guitar requires that you sit while playing. (Flip 
to Book V for the full scoop on playing classical guitar.)

24
Book I: Guitar 101 
Settling in to a sitting position
To hold the guitar in a sitting position, assuming you’re right-handed, rest the 
waist of the guitar on your right leg. (The waist is the indented part between 
the guitar’s upper and lower bouts, the protruding curved parts that look like 
shoulders and hips.) Feet slightly apart, balance the guitar by lightly resting 
your right forearm on the bass bout, as shown in Figure 2-1. Don’t use the 
left hand to support the neck. You should be able to take your left hand com-
pletely off the fretboard without the guitar dipping toward the floor.
 
Figure 2-1: 
Typical sit-
ting position 
for playing 
guitar.
 
Classical guitar technique, on the other hand, requires you to hold the instru-
ment on your left leg, not on your right. This position puts the center of the 
guitar closer to the center of your body, making the instrument easier to 
play, especially with the left hand. That’s because your wrist is straighter, so 
you can better execute the difficult fingerings of classical-guitar music in that 
position. You also elevate the classical guitar, which you can do either by 
raising the left leg with a specially made guitar foot stool (the traditional way) 
or by using a support arm, which goes between your left thigh and the guitar’s 
lower side (the modern way). This device enables your left foot to remain on 
the floor and instead pushes the guitar up in the air.

25
 Chapter 2: Developing Basic Playing Skills
Book I
Guitar 101
Standing position
To stand and play the guitar, you need a strap that is securely fastened to 
both strap pins on the guitar (or otherwise tied to the guitar). Then you can 
stand in a normal way and check out how cool you look in the mirror with 
the guitar slung over your shoulder. You may need to adjust the strap to get 
the guitar at a comfortable playing height.
 
If your strap slips off a pin while you’re playing in a standing position, you 
have about a fifty-fifty chance of catching your guitar before it hits the floor 
(and that’s if you’re quick and experienced with slipping guitars). So don’t 
risk damaging your guitar by using an old or worn strap or one with holes 
that are too large for the pins to hold securely. Guitars aren’t built to bounce, 
as Pete Townshend has demonstrated so many times.
Your body makes a natural adjustment in going from a sitting to a standing 
position. So don’t try to overanalyze where your arms fall, relative to your 
sitting position. Just stay relaxed and, above all, look cool. (You’re a guitar 
player now! Looking cool is just as important as knowing how to play . . . well, 
almost.) Figure 2-2 shows a typical standing position.

Left-hand position: Fretting made easy
To get an idea of correct left-hand positioning on the guitar, extend your left 
hand, palm up, and make a loose fist, placing your thumb roughly between 
your first and second fingers. All of your knuckles should be bent. Your hand 
should look about like that after you stick a guitar neck in there. The thumb 
glides along the back of the neck, straighter than if you were making a fist but 
not rigid. The finger knuckles stay bent whether they’re fretting or relaxed. 
Again, the left hand should fall in place very naturally on the guitar neck, as if 
you were picking up a tool that you’ve been using all your life.
 
To fret a note, press the tip of your finger down on a string, keeping your 
knuckles bent. Try to get the fingertip to come down vertically on the string 
rather than at an angle. This position exerts the greatest pressure on the string 
and also prevents the sides of the finger from touching adjacent strings — 
which may cause either buzzing or muting (deadening the string, or preventing 
it from ringing). Use your thumb from its position underneath the neck to help 
“squeeze” the fingerboard for a tighter grip.
 
When playing a particular fret, you don’t place your finger directly on the 
metal fret, but in between the two frets (or between the nut and 1st fret). 
For example, if you’re playing the 5th fret, place your finger in the square 
between the 4th and 5th frets, not in the middle but closer to the higher fret. 
This gives you the clearest sound and prevents buzzing.
Left-hand fretting requires strength, but don’t be tempted to try to speed up 
the process of strengthening your hands through artificial means. Building 
up the strength in your left hand takes time. You may see advertisements for 
hand-strengthening devices and believe that these products may expedite 
your left-hand endurance. Although we can’t declare that these devices never 
work (and the same goes for the homegrown method of squeezing a racquet 
ball or tennis ball), one thing’s for sure: Nothing helps you build your left-
hand fretting strength better or faster than simply playing guitar.
 
Because of the strength your left hand exerts while fretting, other parts of 
your body may tense up to compensate. At periodic intervals, make sure you 
relax your left shoulder, which has a tendency to rise up as you work on your 
fretting. Take frequent “drop-shoulder” breaks. Make sure as well that your 
left elbow doesn’t stick out to the side, like that of a rude dinner guest. You 
want to keep your upper arm and forearm parallel to the side of your body. 
Relax your elbow so it stays at your side.
 
The important thing to remember in maintaining a good left-hand position is 
that you need to keep it comfortable and natural. If your hand starts to hurt 
or ache, stop playing and take a rest. As with any other activity that requires 
muscular development, resting enables your body to catch up.

Electric endeavours
Electric necks are both narrower (from the 1st string to the 6th) and shal-
lower (from the fingerboard to the back of the neck) than acoustic necks. 
Electric guitars are, therefore, easier to fret. But the space between each 
string is smaller, so you’re more likely to touch and deaden an adjacent 
string with your fretting finger. The biggest difference, however, between fret-
ting on an electric and on a nylon or steel-string acoustic is the action.
A guitar’s action refers to how high above the frets the strings ride and, to a 
lesser extent, how easy they are to fret. On an electric guitar, fretting strings 
is like passing a hot knife through butter. The easier action of an electric 
enables you to use a more relaxed left-hand position than you normally 
would on an acoustic, with the palm of the left hand facing slightly outward. 
Figure 2-3 shows a photo of the left hand resting on the fingerboard of an 
electric guitar, fretting a string.

tric guitar

Classical conditions
Because nylon-string guitars have a wide fingerboard and are the model of 
choice for classical music, their necks require a slightly more (ahem) formal 
left-hand approach. Try to get the palm side of your knuckles (the ones that 
connect your fingers to your hand) to stay close to and parallel to the side 
of the neck. This allows the fingers to run perpendicular to the strings and 
puts all the fingers the same distance away from the neck. (If your hand isn’t 
perfectly parallel, the little finger “falls away” or is farther from the neck than 
your index finger.) Figure 2-4 shows the correct left-hand position for nylon-
string guitars.

28
Book I: Guitar 101

Right-hand position
If you hold a guitar in your lap and drape your right arm over the upper bout, 
your right hand, held loosely outstretched, crosses the strings at about a 
60-degree angle. This position is good for playing with a pick. For fingerstyle 
playing, you want to turn your right hand more perpendicular to the strings. 
For classical guitar, you want to keep the right hand as close to a 90-degree 
angle as possible.
If you’re using a pick
You do almost all of your electric guitar playing with a pick, whether you’re 
belting out rock ’n’ roll, blues, jazz, country, or pop. On acoustic guitar, you 
can play either with a pick or with your fingers. On both electric and acous-
tic, you play most rhythm (chord-based accompaniment) and virtually all lead 
(single-note melodies) by holding the pick, or plectrum (the old-fashioned 
term), between the thumb and index finger.
Figure 2-5 shows the correct way to hold a pick — with just the tip sticking 
out, perpendicular to the thumb.
 
If you’re strumming (playing rhythm), you strike the strings with the pick by 
using wrist and elbow motion. The more vigorous the strum, the more elbow 
you must put into the mix. For playing lead, you use only the more economi-
cal wrist motion. Don’t grip the pick too tightly as you play — and plan on 
dropping it a lot in the first few weeks that you use it.

Figure 2-5: 
Correct 
pick-holding 
technique.
 
 
Picks come in various gauges. A pick’s gauge indicates how stiff, or thick, it is. 
Thinner picks are easier to manage for the beginner. Medium picks are the most 
popular, because they’re flexible enough for comfortable rhythm playing, yet 
stiff enough for leads. Heavy-gauge picks may seem unwieldy at first, but they’re 
the choice for pros, and eventually all skilled instrumentalists graduate to them 
(although a few famous holdouts exist — Neil Young being a prime example).
If you’re using your fingers
If you eschew such paraphernalia as picks and want to go au naturel with 
your right hand, you’re fingerpicking (although you can fingerpick with spe-
cial individual, wraparound picks that attach to your fingers — called, con-
fusingly enough, fingerpicks). Fingerpicking means that you play the guitar by 
plucking the strings with the individual right-hand fingers. The thumb plays 
the bass, or low, strings, and the fingers play the treble, or high, strings. In fin-
gerpicking, you use the tips of the fingers to play the strings, positioning the 
hand over the sound hole (if you’re playing acoustic) and keeping the wrist 
stationary but not rigid. Maintaining a slight arch in the wrist so the fingers 
come down more vertically on the strings also helps.
 
Because of the special right-hand strokes that you use in playing classical 
guitar (the free stroke and the rest stroke), you must hold your fingers almost 
perfectly perpendicular to the strings to execute the correct technique. A 
perpendicular approach enables your fingers to draw against the strings with 
maximum strength.

Understanding Guitar Notation
Although you don’t need to read music to play the guitar, musicians have 
developed a few simple tricks through the years that aid in communicating 
such basic ideas as song structure, chord construction, chord progressions, 
and important rhythmic figures. Pick up on the shorthand devices for chord 
diagrams, rhythm slashes, and tablature, and you’re sure to start coppin’ licks 
faster than Roy Clark after three cups of coffee.
 
You don’t need to read music to play the guitar. With the help of the chord 
diagrams, rhythm slashes, and tablature that’s explained in the following 
sections, plus hearing what all this stuff sounds like through the magic of CD 
technology, you can pick up on everything you need to understand and play 
the guitar, even if you can’t tell a quarter note from an eighth rest. Listen 
closely to the CD and follow the corresponding written examples throughout 
the rest of this book to make sure you understand how the two relate.
Getting by with a little help 
from a chord diagram
Don’t worry — reading a chord diagram is not like reading music; it’s far sim-
pler. All you need to do is understand where to put your fingers to form a 
chord. A chord is defined as the simultaneous sounding of three or more notes.
Figure 2-6 shows the anatomy of a chord chart, and the following list briefly 
explains what the different parts of the diagram mean:
 
 The grid of six vertical lines and five horizontal ones represents the 
guitar fretboard, as if you stood the guitar up on the floor or chair and 
looked straight at the upper part of the neck from the front.
 
 The vertical lines represent the guitar strings. The vertical line at the 
far left is the low 6th string, and the right-most vertical line is the high 
1st string.
 
 The horizontal lines represent frets. The thick horizontal line at the top 
is the nut of the guitar, where the fretboard ends. So the 1st fret is actu-
ally the second vertical line from the top. (Don’t let the words here con-
fuse you; just look at the guitar.)
 
 The dots that appear on vertical string lines between horizontal fret 
lines represent notes that you fret.

31
 Chapter 2: Developing Basic Playing Skills
Book I
Guitar 101
 
 The numerals directly below each string line (just below the last fret 
line) indicate which left-hand finger you use to fret that note. On the 
left hand, 1 = index finger; 2 = middle finger; 3 = ring finger; and 4 = 
little finger. You don’t use the thumb to fret, except in certain unusual 
circumstances.
 
 The X or O symbols directly above some string lines indicate strings 
that you leave open (unfretted) or that you don’t play. An X (not shown 
in Figure 2-6) above a string means you don’t pick or strike that string 
with your right hand. An O indicates an open string that you do play.

If a chord is to be played somewhere beyond the first four frets, a numeral 
appears to the right of the diagram, next to the top fret line, to indicate in 
which fret the diagram actually starts. (In such cases, the top line is not the 
nut.) In most cases, however, you deal primarily with chords that fall within 
only the first four frets of the guitar. Chords that fall within the first four frets 
typically use open strings, so they’re referred to as open chords.
Reading rhythm slashes
Musicians use a variety of shorthand tricks to indicate certain musical 
directions. They use this shorthand because, although a particular musical 
concept itself is often simple enough, to notate that idea in standard written 

32
Book I: Guitar 101 
music form may prove unduly complicated and cumbersome. So they use a 
“crib sheet” or a “road map” that gets the point across yet avoids the issue of 
reading (or writing) music.
Rhythm slashes are slash marks (/) that simply tell you how to play rhythmi-
cally but not what to play. The chord in your left hand determines what you 
play. Say, for example, you see the diagram shown in Figure 2-7.
 
Figure 2-7: 
One 
measure of 
an E chord.
 
& 44 ’ ’ ’ ’
E
If you see such a chord symbol with four slashes beneath it, as shown in 
Figure 2-7, you know to finger an E chord and strike it four times. What you 
don’t see, however, is a number of differently pitched notes clinging to vari-
ous lines of a music staff, including several hole-in-the-center half notes and a 
slew of solid quarter notes — in short, any of that junk you needed to memo-
rize in grade school just to play “Mary Had a Little Lamb” on the recorder. 
All you need to remember on seeing this particular diagram is to “play an E 
chord four times.” Simple, isn’t it?
Taking a look at tablature
 
Tablature (or tab, for short) is a notation system that graphically represents 
the frets and strings of the guitar. Whereas chord diagrams do so in a static 
way, tablature shows how you play music over a period of time. For all the 
musical examples that appear in this book, you see a tablature staff (or tab 
staff, for short) beneath the standard notation staff. This second staff reflects 
exactly what’s going on in the regular musical staff above it — but in guitar 
language. Tab is guitar-specific — in fact, many call it simply guitar tab. Tab 
doesn’t tell you what note to play (such as C or F# or E%). It does, however, tell 
you what string to fret and where exactly on the fingerboard to fret that string.
Figure 2-8 shows you the tab staff and some sample notes and a chord. The 
top line of the tab staff represents the 1st string of the guitar — high E. The 
bottom line of the tab corresponds to the 6th string on the guitar, low E. The 
other lines represent the other four strings in between — the second line from 
the bottom is the 5th string, and so on. A number appearing on any given line 
tells you to fret that string in that numbered fret. For example, if you see the 
numeral 2 on the second line from the top, you need to press down the 2nd 
string in the 2nd fret above the nut (actually, the space between the 1st and 
2nd metal frets). A 0 on a line means you play the open string.

How to Play a Chord
Chords are the basic building blocks of songs. You can play a chord, which 
is the simultaneous sounding of three or more notes, several ways on the 
guitar — by strumming (dragging a pick or the back of your fingernails across 
the strings in a single, quick motion), plucking (with the individual right-hand 
fingers), or even smacking the strings with your open hand or fist. (Okay, 
that’s rare, unless you’re in a heavy metal band.) But you can’t just strike 
any group of notes; you must play a group of notes organized in some musi-
cally meaningful arrangement. For the guitarist, that means learning left-hand 
chord forms.
Fingering a chord
After you think you understand (somewhat) the guitar notation described in 
the preceding sections, your best bet is to just jump right in and play your 
first chord. You can start with E major, because it’s a particularly guitar-
friendly chord and one that you use a lot.
After you get the hang of playing chords, you eventually find that you can 
move several fingers into position simultaneously. For now, however, just 
place your fingers one at a time on the frets and strings, as the following 
instructions indicate (you can also refer to Figure 2-6):
 
1. Place your first (index) finger on the 3rd string, 1st fret (actually 
between the nut and 1st fret but closer to the fret).
 
 Don’t press down hard until you have your other fingers in place. Apply 
just enough pressure to keep your finger from moving off the string.
 
2. Place your second (middle) finger on the 5th string (skipping over the 
4th string), 2nd fret.
 
 Again, apply just enough pressure to keep your fingers in place. You 
now have two fingers on the guitar, on the 3rd and 5th strings, with an 
as-yet unfretted string (the 4th) in between.

34
Book I: Guitar 101 
 
3. Place your third (ring) finger on the 4th string, 2nd fret.
 
 You may need to wriggle your ring finger a bit to get it to fit in there with 
the first and second fingers and below the fret wire. Figure 2-9 shows a 
photo of how your E chord should look after your fingers are positioned 
correctly.
Now that your fingers are in position, strike all six strings with your right 
hand to hear your first chord, E.
 
Figure 2-9: 
Notice how 
the fingers 
curve and 
the knuckles 
bend on an 
E chord.
 
Avoiding buzzes
 
One of the hardest things to do in playing chords is to avoid buzzing. Buzzing 
results if you’re not pressing down quite hard enough when you fret. A buzz 
can also result if a fretting finger accidentally comes in contact with an adja-
cent string, preventing that string from ringing freely. Without removing your 
fingers from the frets, try “rocking and rolling” your fingers around on their 
tips to eliminate any buzzes when you strum the chord.

B
uying a new guitar is an exciting proposition. You go to the music store 
and immediately face a world of possibilities, a supermarket of tantaliz-
ing choices. Every guitar on the wall seems to scream, “Pick me! Pick me!” 
Should you resist, exercise restraint, and avoid the models you know you 
can’t afford?
Heck, no. Be bold and try any model that strikes your fancy. You’re not 
asking to test-drive a Ferrari; you’re simply asking the salesperson to see how 
different guitars feel and sound. And you’re not being frivolous either. Playing 
a range of guitars helps you understand the differences between high-quality, 
expensive guitars and acceptable but affordable guitars.
So indulge yourself. Even if you don’t have enough experience to recognize 
the subtle differences between a good guitar and a great guitar, at least expose 
yourself to them. And don’t wait until the day you decide to buy to pick one 
up for the first time. Make several visits to the music store before you’re ready 
to buy and then take the time to absorb your experiences. Visit several differ-
ent stores if you can. Some may be the exclusive dealer of a specific brand in 
your region; others may not be able to sell that brand of guitar. The info in this 
chapter can make picking out a guitar an even better experience.
After you buy a guitar (or two or three), restringing is a necessary task. Many 
people seem reluctant to tune their strings, let alone change them. Although 
you should be careful not to drop or scratch your guitar (and setting gui-
tars afire à la Jimi Hendrix generally causes significant damage), you needn’t 
worry about causing damage by changing, tuning, or overtightening guitar 
strings. Guitars are incredibly rugged and can deal with hundreds of pounds 
of string tension while enduring the playing of even the most heavy-handed 
guitarists. Changing strings isn’t something you should be shy about: You 

36
Book I: Guitar 101 
can jump into it with both feet. It improves the sound of the guitar, helps 
prevent broken strings at inopportune moments, and aids you in identifying 
other maintenance problems. (During periodic string changing, for example, 
you may discover a gouged bridge slot or a loose tuning post.) This chapter 
explains what you need to know.
Before You Break Out Your Wallet
Before you walk into your local music store ready to plop down your hard-
earned dough on a new guitar, you need to take stock of what you’re doing. 
Ask yourself some tough questions about your pending purchase — and you 
need to do so now. Don’t wait until you get to the store to develop a buying 
strategy. The two most important factors in making any purchasing decision — 
especially concerning a guitar, where passions run high — are to develop a 
plan and to gather all the information you need to make the best choice.
Start developing your purchasing plan by answering specific questions about 
exactly what you want in a guitar — and how much you can spend to attain 
it. Narrowing your scope doesn’t mean you can’t change your mind after you 
get to the store and see all the nifty instruments available, or that you can’t 
let on-the-spot inspiration and whim play a significant part in your final deci-
sion. (“I just can’t decide between these two guitars . . . oh, what the heck! 
Just give me both of them!”) But you do need a point from which to depart.
 
Ask yourself the following questions:
 
 What’s my level of commitment? Regardless of your current ability, do 
you realistically envision yourself practicing every day for the next five 
years, pursuing a dedicated program of guitar excellence? Or do you 
first want to see whether this whole “guitar thing” is going to stick? Just 
because you can afford a $1,000 guitar doesn’t mean you should buy it. 
Before plunking down cash, honestly determine the importance of the 
guitar in your life and act responsibly according to that priority.
 
 What’s my spending limit? The answer to this question is critical 
because, often, the more expensive the guitar, the greater its appeal. 
So you need to balance your level of commitment and your available 
resources. You don’t want to have to give up food for six months and 
live in a cardboard box just because you got carried away at the music 
store. Set a limit on how much you can spend and don’t exceed it.
 
 Do I buy retail or online or mail order? If you know exactly what you 
want — down to the color and options — you may consider buying a 
guitar through mail order or online; you often get the best deal and 
may even avoid paying sales tax (if the music company is out of state). 
Buying sight unseen is common with many products, such as automo-
biles and computers. But if you can’t cotton to buying something as 

37

personal as a guitar without falling in love with it first — and you want 
to “date” your guitar before “marrying” it — stick with retail. A retail 
outlet usually comes with an official service agreement and unofficial, 
friendly cooperation from the staff that’s worth its weight in gold. 
Music stores know they’re competing with online and mail-order ser-
vices, and they make up for it in spades with service.
 
 Am I a “new-guitar person” or a “used-guitar person”? You’re going to 
have a much easier time comparing attributes among new guitars. And 
all the retail and discount prices of new instruments are pretty much 
standardized — which is not to say that all the prices are the same; 
stores usually discount at different rates. Expect to pay between 10 and 
35 percent off the “list” price (manufacturer’s suggested retail price) 
at a music store and even less online or via mail order. Big chains offer 
better discounts than smaller mom-and-pop stores because they buy in 
quantity and get a better price from the manufacturer.
 
 Retail, online, and mail-order operations also offer a warranty against 
any manufacturer defects on new instruments. You don’t find any 
comparable protection if you’re buying a guitar from a newspaper ad 
(although music stores also sell used instruments, usually with warran-
ties). But on the other hand, you can sometimes get a really good deal 
on a used instrument if you know what to look for. If you want a vintage 
instrument, you’re looking at a used guitar by definition.
 
 As a rule, most asking prices in newspaper ads are too high. Be ready to 
dicker to get a better price for such a guitar — even if it’s exactly what 
you’re looking for.
After you have satisfactory answers to the preceding questions, proceed to 
the second prong of your guitar-purchasing attack plan: gathering informa-
tion on the specific guitar for you. The following section helps you become 
more knowledgeable about guitar construction, materials, and workmanship. 
Remember, being an informed buyer is the best defense against making a bad 
deal in the retail arena.
Beginner Guitars
If you’re just starting out as a novice guitarist, you may ask the musical ques-
tion, “What’s the minimum I need to spend to avoid winding up with a piece 
of junk?” That’s a good question, because modern manufacturing practices 
now enable luthiers (the fancy term for guitar makers) to turn out some 
pretty good stuff for around $200 — and even less sometimes.
 
If you’re an adult (older than 14), and you’re looking to grow with an instru-
ment, plan to spend between $200 and $250 for an acoustic guitar and a little 
less for an electric. (Electric guitars are easier to build, so they usually cost a 
bit less than comparable acoustics.)

Book I: Guitar 101 
Consider the following criteria:
 
 Appearance: You must like the way a particular guitar looks, or you’re 
never really happy with it. So use your eye and your aesthetic taste to 
select possible candidates. A red guitar isn’t inherently better or worse 
than a green one, but you’re perfectly free to base your decision to buy 
simply on whether you like the look of the guitar.
 
 Playability: Just because a guitar is relatively inexpensive doesn’t nec-
essarily mean it’s difficult to play (although this correlation was often 
the case in the past). You should be able to press the strings down to 
the fretboard with relative ease. And you shouldn’t find the up-the-neck 
frets unduly difficult either, although they’re sometimes harder to play 
than the lower frets are.
 
 Here’s a way to get some perspective on playability. Pick up a more 
expensive guitar and see how it plays. Then return to the more afford-
able instrument you’re considering. Is the playability wildly different? It 
shouldn’t be. If it doesn’t feel comfortable to you, move on.
 
 Intonation: A guitar must play in tune. Test the intonation by playing 
a 12th-fret harmonic (just barely touch the fret instead of pressing it 
down) on the 1st string and match that to the fretted note at the 12th 
fret. Although the notes are of a different tonal quality, the pitch should 
be exactly the same. Apply this test to all six strings. Listen especially to 
the 3rd and the 6th strings. Those strings often go out of tune first. If in 
doubt, enlist the aid of an experienced guitarist on this issue; it’s crucial.
 
 Solid construction: If you’re checking out an acoustic, rap gently on 
the top of the instrument (like your doctor does to check your ribs 
and chest) to make sure it’s rattle-free. Peer inside the hole, looking for 
gobs of glue and other evidence of sloppy workmanship. Rough-sanded 
braces are a big tip-off to a hastily constructed instrument. On an elec-
tric, test that the metal hardware is tightly secured and rattle-free. 
Without plugging into an amp, strum the open strings hard and listen for 
rattling. Running your hand along the edge of the neck to check that the 
frets are smooth and filed correctly is another good test. If you’re not 
sure what you should be feeling, consult an experienced guitarist on a 
“fret check.”
Models for a Particular Style
Asking for a type of guitar by musical style is completely legitimate. Ask for a 
heavy metal guitar, for example, and the salesperson will nod knowingly and 
lead you to the scary-looking stuff. Ask for a jazz guitar, and you’ll wind up 
down toward the guys with berets and “Bird lives!” buttons.
Figure 3-1 shows popular models. Note the diversity in shape and style.

Now, some musical styles do share guitar models. You can play both blues 
and rock, for example, on a Fender Stratocaster. And a Gibson Les Paul is just 
as capable of a wailing lead as a Strat. (As a rule, however, the tone of a Les 
Paul is going to be fatter and less jangly than that of a Strat.) Making your 
own kind of music on the guitar of your choice is part of the fun.
 
Following are some popular music styles and classic guitars that many 
people associate with those styles. This list is by no means exhaustive but 
does include recognized standard bearers of the respective genres:
 
 Acoustic blues: National Steel, Gibson J-200
 
 Bluegrass: Martin Dreadnought, Taylor Dreadnought, Collings 
Dreadnought, Santa Cruz Dreadnought, Gallagher Dreadnought
 
 Classical: Ramirez, Hopf, Khono, Humphrey, Hernandez, Alvarez
 
 Country: Fender Telecaster, Gretsch 6120, Fender Stratocaster
 
 Electric blues: Gibson ES-355, Fender Telecaster, Fender Stratocaster, 
Gibson Les Paul
 
 Folk: Dreadnoughts and Grand Concerts by Martin, Taylor, Collings, 
Larrivée, Lowden, and Guild; Gibson J-200; Ovation Adamas
 
 Heavy metal: Gibson Explorer, Flying V, and SG; Fender Stratocaster; 
Dean; Ibanez Iceman; Jackson Soloist
 
 Jazz: Gibson ES-175, Super 400 L-5, and Johnny Smith; archtops by 
D’Angelico, D’Aquisto, and Benedetto; Epiphone Emperor Regent; Ibanez 
signature models

Although the preceding list contains guitars that people generally associate 
with given styles, don’t let that limit your creativity. Play the music you want 
to play on the guitar you want to play it on, no matter what some chart tells 
you. In other words, after you study this list, go pick out the guitar you want 
and play the music you want. These guitars are all super-sweet, and the price 
tag reflects the quality as well as the heritage of these guitars.
Choosing a Good Guitar
You may decide, if you can afford it, to start off on the right foot and pony 
up for a quality instrument. If you go cheap at first and fall in love with the 
guitar, sooner or later you will be back for a better one. What do you need to 
know when selecting a better guitar?
 
If you already have one guitar, consider the following three common 
approaches to choosing another guitar:
 
 The contrasting and complementary approach: If you own an acoustic, 
you may want to consider getting an electric (or vice versa), because 
having different guitars in your arsenal is always nice. Diversity is very 
healthy for a person seeking to bolster a collection.
 
 The clone approach: Some just want to acquire as many, say, Les Pauls 
as they can in a lifetime: old ones, new ones, red ones, blue ones . . . 
hey — it’s your money. Buy as many as you want and can afford.
 
 The upgrade approach: If all you ever want to do is master the 
Stratocaster, just get a better version of what you had before. That way, 
you can use the new guitar for important occasions, such as recording 
and performing, and the old ax for going to the beach.
 
How much should you spend on your better instrument? One guideline is to 
go up into the next spending bracket from your old guitar. This way, you 
don’t end up with many similar guitars. Plan on spending about $200 more 
than the current value (not what you paid) of the guitar you own. By doing 
so, you ensure that even if you stick with a certain model, you’re getting a 
guitar that’s categorically different from your initial instrument.
When should you stop? When the money runs out, of course. Actually, no 
hard-and-fast rules dictate how many guitars are “enough.” These days, 
however, a reasonably well-appointed guitar arsenal includes a single-coil 

41

Book I

electric (such as a Fender Strat), a humbucker electric (such as a Gibson Les 
Paul), a semihollow-body electric, a hollow-body jazz (electric), an acoustic 
steel-string, an acoustic 12-string, and a nylon-string classical. Maybe you can 
add one or two more guitars in a given specialty, such as a guitar set up espe-
cially for playing slide, a 12-string electric, or an electric bass. (Then you can 
start collecting mandolins, banjos, ukuleles, Dobros . . .)
 
In upgrading, the issue again becomes one of quality. But instead of just 
making sure the instrument plays in tune, frets easily, and doesn’t collapse if 
you breathe on it, you also need to make informed decisions. Don’t worry — 
that’s not as grave as it sounds. Consider the following pillars for judging 
quality in an instrument:
 
 Construction: How the guitar is designed and put together
 
 Materials: Mainly woods and metals (hardware, pickups, electronics)
 
 Workmanship: The quality of the building
Construction
How a guitar is built defines what type of guitar it is and (generally) what 
type of music it’s used for. The following sections cover the three most 
important issues regarding guitar construction.
Solid wood versus laminated wood
A solid-wood acoustic guitar is better than a laminated acoustic guitar — 
where, instead of using a solid, thicker piece of top-wood, the guitar maker 
uses several layers of inexpensive wood pressed together and covered with a 
veneer. Guitars made completely out of solid wood cost at least $1,000.
 
The acoustic guitar’s top is the most critical element in sound production; 
the back and sides primarily reflect the sound back through the top. So, if 
you can’t pick up the tab for a solid-wood acoustic guitar, look to various 
configurations in which the top is solid and various other parts are lami-
nated. A good choice is a solid-top guitar with laminated back and sides, 
which can cost as little as $400.
Another very popular configuration, just a step higher in quality, is a guitar 
with a solid top, a solid back, and laminated sides. You can find acoustics 
constructed this way at around the $1,200 mark or even slightly less. Because 
the sides have a negligible effect on the sound, and because laminates are 
structurally stronger than solid woods, this setup is a win-win situation for 
manufacturer and buyer.
 
If you’re unsure as to whether a guitar has solid or laminated wood, ask the 
dealer or consult the manufacturer.

42
Book I: Guitar 101 
Body caps
In the electric realm, one big determinant of price is whether the top has a 
cap. A cap is a decorative layer of fine wood — usually a variety of figured 
maple (having a naturally occurring decorative grain pattern) — that sits on 
top of the body without affecting the sound. Popular cap woods include flame 
maple and quilted maple. Figured-wood tops usually come with clear, or see-
through, finishes to show off the wood’s attractive grain pattern.
Neck construction
 
The following list describes the three most common types of neck construc-
tion, from the least expensive to the most:
 
 Bolt-on: The neck attaches to the back of the guitar at the heel with four 
or five bolts (although a heel plate sometimes covers the bolt holes). 
Fender Stratocasters and Telecasters have bolt-on necks.
 
 Set-in (or glued-in): The neck joins the body with an unbroken surface 
covering the connection, for a seamless effect from neck to body. The 
joint is glued. Gibson Les Pauls and Paul Reed Smiths have set-in necks.
 
 Neck through body: A high-end construction where the neck is one 
long unit (although usually consisting of several pieces of wood glued 
together) that doesn’t stop at the body but continues all the way 
through to the tail of the guitar. This type of neck is great for getting 
maximum sustain. A Jackson Soloist has a neck-through-body design.
 
Just because a construction technique is more advanced or expensive 
doesn’t mean it’s necessarily better. Could you “improve” the sound of Jimi 
Hendrix’s Strat by modifying its neck to a glued-in configuration? Sacrilege!
Materials
A guitar isn’t limited by what it’s made of any more than a sculpture is. 
Michelangelo’s David and your Aunt Agnes’s candy dish are both made of 
marble, but which one would you travel to Paris to see? So don’t judge a 
guitar only by its materials, but consider that a guitar with better materials 
(abalone inlays as opposed to plastic ones) tends to have commensurately 
better workmanship — and therefore be a better guitar — than a model that 
uses inexpensive materials.
Woods
As you may expect, the more expensive or rare a wood, the more expensive 
the guitar you construct from that wood. Guitar makers break woods down 
into categories, and each has a bearing on the guitar’s overall expense.

43
 Chapter 3: Buying and Stringing Guitars
Book I
Guitar 101
 
Following are the three criteria used for classifying wood:
 
 Type: For example, mahogany, maple, or rosewood. Rosewood tends to 
be the most expensive wood used in the construction of acoustic-guitar 
bodies, followed by maple, and then mahogany.
 
 Style: You can classify woods further by looking at the wood’s region 
or grain style. Brazilian rosewood is redder and wavier than East Indian 
rosewood and is also more expensive. The figured maples, such as 
quilted and flame, are more expensive than rock or bird’s-eye maples.
 
 Grade: Guitar makers use a grading system, from A to AAA (the highest), 
to evaluate woods based on grain, color, and consistency. High-quality 
guitars get the highest-grade wood.
Hardware: Tuners and bridge assemblies
In more expensive instruments, you see upgrades on all components, includ-
ing the hardware, or the metal parts of the guitar. Chrome-plated hardware is 
usually the cheapest, so if you begin looking at more expensive guitars, you 
start to see gold-plated and black-matte-finished knobs, switches, and tuning 
machines in place of chrome.
 
The actual hardware the manufacturer uses — not just the finishes on it — 
changes, too, on more expensive instruments. High-quality, name-brand hard-
ware often replaces the guitar maker’s less prestigious, generic brand of 
hardware on high-end axes. For example, manufacturers may use a higher-
grade product for the tuning machines on an upscale guitar — such as lock-
ing Spurzels (a popular third-party tuner type and brand), which lock the 
string in place as opposed to forcing the user to tie the string off at the post.
The bridge is an important upgrade area as well. The so-called floating 
bridge (so designated because you can move it up and down by means of 
the whammy bar) is a complicated affair of springs, fine-tuning knobs, and 
anchors. The better floating assemblies, such as the Floyd Rose system 
or systems manufactured under a Floyd Rose license, operate much more 
smoothly and reliably than do the simple three-spring varieties found on low-
cost guitars. (The strings spring right back to pitch on a Floyd Rose system, 
even after the most torturous whammy bar abuse. You can find out more 
about the Floyd Rose bridge later in this chapter.)
Pickups and electronics (electrics only)
Unless a guitar manufacturer is also known for making great pickups, you 
see more and more use of third-party pickups as you go up the quality 
ladder. In the electric arena, Seymour Duncan, DiMarzio, Bartolini, Bill 
Lawrence, Lace, and EMG are examples of high-quality pickup brands that 
guitar makers piggyback onto their models. Fishman and L.R. Baggs are two 
popular acoustic pickup systems found on many well-known guitars.

44
Book I: Guitar 101 
Although they’re not known by name brands, the electronics in guitars also 
improve along with the other components as you venture into more expen-
sive territory. You can see a greater variety, for example, in pickup manipu-
lation. Manufacturers can provide circuitry that changes double-coil, or 
humbucker, pickups into single-coils, enabling them to emulate the behavior 
of Stratlike pickups. Having one guitar that can imitate the pickup behavior of 
other guitar types provides you with a tonally versatile instrument. You also 
see more manipulation in wiring schemes. For example, guitar makers may 
reverse the polarity of a pickup — the direction the signal flows — to make 
the guitar sound softer and more swirly.
 
With more expensive guitars, you may also encounter improved volume and 
tone controls, resulting in better taper. Taper is the gradualness or abrupt-
ness of change (also called response) of a signal’s characteristics (in this 
case, volume and tone) as you turn a knob from its minimum value to its 
maximum. A knob exhibiting a smoother taper is evidence of a higher grade 
of electronics. Really cheap guitars give you no sound at all until turned up 
to 3; then you get a swell of sound from about 4 to about 7 and no change at 
all between 7 and the knob’s maximum value, 10 — or, on those really rare, 
loud guitars, 11. (And if you don’t get that last joke, go out and rent This Is 
Spinal Tap. It’s required viewing for all guitarists.)
Workmanship
For more expensive guitars, you can really bring out the white glove and get 
fussy. We’ve seen prospective buyers bring in a dentist’s mirror to inspect 
the interior of an acoustic guitar.
 
For acoustic guitars beyond the $600 range, you should expect to find gapless 
joints — solid wood-to-wood connections between components, especially 
where the neck meets the body. You should also expect clean and glob-free 
gluing (in the top and back bracing), a smooth and even finish application, 
and strings at the right height with no buzzing, the neck warp- and twist-free, 
and the intonation true. You can glean all of this information by simply play-
ing the guitar and noting your impressions. Like traveling in a Rolls-Royce or 
Bentley, playing a quality guitar should be one smooth ride.
Buying an Ax to Grind
Buying a guitar is similar to buying a car or house (okay, it’s a little less mon-
umental than buying a house) in that it’s lots of fun, but you must exercise 
caution and be a savvy customer, too. Only you know the right guitar for you, 
what the right price is for your budget and commitment level, and whether 

45
 Chapter 3: Buying and Stringing Guitars
Book I
Guitar 101
a deal feels right. Don’t deny your natural shopping instincts, even if you’re 
new to guitar shopping. Look, listen, consider, go have lunch before the big 
buy, and talk it over with your sweetie.
Bringing along an expert
A certain saying goes, “An expert is someone who knows more than you do.” 
If you have such a friend — whose guitar knowledge and experience exceeds 
your own — bring the friend along, by all means. This friend not only knows 
about guitars, but also knows you. A salesperson doesn’t know you, nor 
does he necessarily have your best interests in mind. But a friend does. And 
another opinion never hurts, if only to help you articulate your own.
 
Enlist your guitar teacher (if you have one) to help you navigate through the 
guitar buyer’s jungle, especially if he’s been with you awhile and knows your 
tastes and playing style. Your teacher may know things about you that you 
may not even realize about yourself — for example, that you’ve gotten side-
tracked in the steel-string section although your interests lie in nylon-string 
guitar music. A good teacher asks questions, listens to your answers, and 
gently guides you to where you want to go.
Your expert is also likely to bring along an electronic guitar tuner to tune 
potential guitars to standard pitch. This is an excellent idea. A shop may tune 
a guitar slightly lower to make it seem easier to play; then when you get it 
home and tune it properly, you find out it doesn’t play like it did in the store.
Meeting the salesperson
Dealing with a salesperson doesn’t need to be a stressful, adversarial affair, 
but some people get pretty anxious about the entire situation. If you estab-
lish your priorities before you enter the store, you don’t come off as vague 
and unprepared as he begins his salvo of questions. A typical first question 
from a salesperson may be “How much do you want to spend?” In essence, 
the question means “What price range are you looking at so I know which 
end of the store to take you to?” It’s a fair question, and if you can answer 
directly, you can save a lot of time. He may also ask about your playing abil-
ity and style preferences, so be ready for those questions, too.
 
Be prepared to answer the salesperson’s questions succinctly — for example, 
“I prefer Strat-style guitars, although not necessarily by Fender, and I’m an 
intermediate blues player — not a shredder — and I’d like to keep costs at 
less than $600.” Answers such as these make you sound decisive and 
thoughtful, and the salesperson would have plenty to go on. But if you say, 
“Oh, for the right guitar, price is no object; I like the one that what’s-his-name 
plays on MTV,” you won’t be taken seriously — nor are you likely to end up 

46
Book I: Guitar 101 
with the instrument you need. As the salesperson speaks, listen carefully and 
ask questions. You’re there to observe and absorb, not impress. If you decide 
you’re not ready to buy, tell him that. Thank him for his time and get his 
card. You’re free to go elsewhere and investigate another store.
The art of the deal
 
You can find out the retail, or list, price of an instrument before you walk into 
the store. The manufacturer presets these numbers, and they’re public 
knowledge (look at ads in magazines or visit the manufacturer’s Web site). As 
of this writing, a Gibson Les Paul Standard lists for $3,899, and a Fender 
American Standard Stratocaster lists for $1,680 (see Figure 3-2).

dards by

tars on the

Again, the preceding numbers are list prices. Music stores offer discounts, 
and the range can vary greatly. Big, urban-based stores that buy mass quan-
tities of instruments can usually offer greater discounts than can smaller 
(mom-and-pop) stores in outlying or remote areas. Mail-order and online out-
lets can match and sometimes beat big-store prices, because they don’t have 
the overhead of maintaining a retail facility.
 
In deciding where to buy, don’t neglect the value of service. Retail and mom-
and-pop stores — unlike online and mail-order houses — are in a better posi-
tion to devote close, personal service to a new guitar customer. Perhaps as a 
result of stiff competition from the booming online and mail-order biz, many 
stores are upping their service incentives. Service includes anything from 
fixing minor problems and making adjustments to providing periodic setups 
(sort of like a tune-up and oil change for your guitar).

47
 Chapter 3: Buying and Stringing Guitars
Book I
Guitar 101
Remember, however, that list prices are public knowledge, and salespeople 
from all types of vendors must tell you their selling price with no conditions. 
The vendor can rightfully charge up to list price; you must wrangle the maxi-
mum discount yourself. How you do that is as old as bargaining itself, but a 
reasonable haggling range is somewhere between the cut-rate quote of an 
online or mail-order outfit and 10 percent off list.
Knowing When to Change the Strings
Old guitars improve with age, but old strings don’t. The first time you play 
new strings is the best they ever sound. Strings gradually deteriorate until 
they either break or you can’t take the dreary sounds they produce. Old 
strings sound dull and lifeless, and they lose tensility (ability to hold tension), 
becoming brittle. This condition makes them feel stiffer and harder to fret, 
and because the strings no longer stretch to reach the fret, they get tighter, 
causing your notes to go sharp, particularly up the neck.
 
You should replace all the strings at once, unless you break one and must 
replace it quickly. Strings tend to wear at the same rate, so they start the race 
against time on equal footing.
 
You should probably replace your strings if
 
 They exhibit visible signs of corrosion or caked-on dirt or grime.
 
 They don’t play in tune or fret sharp, especially in the upper register.
 
 You can’t remember the last time you changed them and you have an 
important gig (and don’t want to chance any breakage).
 
Strings build up dirt and skin from your fingers, making them sound dull. 
The old boiling trick removes this gunk and can bring temporary new life to 
old strings. Simply fill a large pot with water, coil up your strings in it (be 
careful — strings tend to want to jump out of pots), and bring to boil for 
five minutes or so. Boiled strings really do sound better for a short time. Do 
this if you have a gig or jam on short notice and no way to get new strings. 
But then go get new strings.
Off with the Old: Removing 
Stressed Strings
Obviously, to put on a new string you have to remove the old one. Unless 
you’re really in a hurry (such as in the middle of the first verse), you can 
take off any string by turning the tuning machine or peg to loosen the string 

48
Book I: Guitar 101 
enough that you can grab the string from the center and pull it off the post. 
You don’t need to unwind it completely off the post using the peg. Or simply 
snip off the old string with wire cutters. It seems weird and brutal to snip off 
a string, but neither the sudden release of tension nor the cutting itself hurts 
the guitar.
 
The only reason not to cut a string is to save it as a spare, in case the new one 
breaks while putting it on (rare, but it happens). An old B string is better than 
no B string.
A common belief is that you should maintain constant string tension on 
the guitar neck at all times, and that you should replace the strings one at 
a time because removing all the strings at once is bad for the guitar. Every 
guitar expert has an opinion on this issue. Some say it’s fine to remove all the 
strings and put new ones back on one at a time because guitars are actually 
tougher than you think. Others point out that changing strings one at a time 
is a safer way to go. Replacing strings one at a time is actually convenient for 
tuning, but whether it’s healthier for the guitar is debated.
However you remove the old string, after it’s off, you’re ready to put on a new 
one. The methods for stringing a guitar diverge slightly, depending on whether 
you’re stringing a steel-string acoustic, a classical, or an electric guitar. The 
remaining sections in this chapter describe these methods in detail.
Stringing a Steel-String Acoustic Guitar
Generally, steel-string acoustic guitars are probably easier to string than clas-
sicals or electrics (which are covered later in this chapter).
Changing strings step by step
Following are step-by-step instructions on restringing your guitar. You have 
two places to attach your new string: the bridge and the headstock. Start by 
attaching the string to the bridge, which is a pretty straightforward task.
Step 1: Attaching the string to the bridge
Acoustic guitars have a bridge with six holes leading to the inside of the 
guitar. To attach a new string to the bridge, follow these steps:
 
1. Remove the old string and pop out the bridge pin.
 
 Bridge pins sometimes stick, so you may need to use needle-nose pliers 
to pry them out. Always pull straight up.

49
 Chapter 3: Buying and Stringing Guitars
Book I
Guitar 101
 
2. Place the end of the new string that has a little brass ring (called a 
ball) inside the hole that held the bridge pin.
 
 Just stuff it down the hole a couple of inches. (How far isn’t critical, 
because you’re going to pull it up soon.)
 
3. Wedge the bridge pin firmly back in the hole with the slot facing for-
ward (toward the nut).
 
 The slot provides a channel for the string to get out. Figure 3-3 shows 
the correct disposition for the new string and the bridge pin.
 
Figure 3-3: 
How to 
place the 
new string 
in the bridge 
and position 
the bridge 
pin.
 
 
4. Pull gently on the string until the ball rests against the bottom of the 
pin. Keep your thumb or finger on the pin so it doesn’t pop out.
 
 Be careful not to kink the string as you pull it.
 
5. Test the string by gently tugging on it.
 
 If you don’t feel the string shift, the ball is snug against the bridge pin, 
and you’re ready to secure the string to the tuning post.
Step 2: Securing the string to the tuning post
After securely attaching the string to the bridge pin, you can focus your 
attention on the headstock. The steps are slightly different for the treble 
strings (G, B, E) and the bass strings (E, A, D). On a typical guitar, you wind 
treble strings clockwise and bass strings counterclockwise.

50
Book I: Guitar 101 
To attach a treble string to the tuning post, follow these steps:
 
1. Pass the string through the hole in the post.
 
 Leave enough slack between the bridge pin and the tuning post to 
enable you to wind the string around the post several times.
 
2. Kink (or crease) the metal wire toward the inside of the guitar.
 
 Figure 3-4 shows how to kink the string to prepare it for winding.
 
Figure 3-4: 
String 
kinked to 
the inside 
of the head-
stock, with 
slack for 
winding.
 
 
3. While keeping the string tight against the post with one hand, wind 
the tuning peg clockwise with the other hand.
 
 This step is a bit tricky and requires some manual dexterity. Keep your 
eye on the post to ensure that as the string wraps around the post, it 
winds down, toward the headstock surface. Figure 3-5 shows how the 
strings wrap around the posts. Be sure that the strings go into the cor-
rect slot in the nut. Don’t get discouraged if you can’t get your windings 
to look exactly like the strings shown in Figure 3-5. Getting everything to 
go smoothly takes a bit of practice.

51
 Chapter 3: Buying and Stringing Guitars
Book I
Guitar 101
 
 Winding the string downward on the post increases what’s called the 
breaking angle. The breaking angle is the angle between the post and 
the nut. A sharper angle brings more tension down onto the nut and 
creates better sustain, the length of time the note continues. To get the 
maximum angle, wind the string so it sits as low as possible on the post. 
(This fact is true for all guitars, not just acoustics.)

strings wrap

direction.
 
To attach a bass string, you follow the preceding steps except that you wind 
the strings counterclockwise in Step 3 so the string goes up the middle and 
goes over the post to the left (as you face the headstock).
 
If you find that you’ve left too much slack, unwind the string and start again, 
kinking the string farther down. If you don’t leave enough slack, your winding 
doesn’t go all the way down the post, which may result in slipping if the 
string doesn’t have enough length to grab firmly around the post. Neither sit-
uation is tragic. You simply undo what you’ve done and try again. As may 
happen in trying to get the two ends of a necktie the same length, you may 
need a couple of tries to get it right.
Tuning up
After you secure the string around the post, you can begin to hear the string 
come up to pitch. As the string draws tight, place it in its correct nut slot. If 
you’re changing strings one at a time, you can just tune the new one to the 
old ones, which, presumably, are relatively in tune. (Check out Chapter 1 in 
Book I for the nuts and bolts of tuning your guitar.)

52
Book I: Guitar 101 
After you get the string to the correct pitch, pull on it in various places up 
and down its length to stretch it out a bit. Doing so can cause the string to go 
flat — sometimes drastically if you left any loose windings on the post — so 
tune it back up to pitch by winding the peg. Repeat the tune-stretch process 
two or three times to help the new string hold its pitch.
 
Using a peg winder to quickly turn the tuning pegs reduces your string-winding 
time considerably. A peg winder also features a notch in one side of the sleeve 
that can help you pop a stuck bridge pin. Just make sure you don’t lose the pin 
when it comes flying out!
 
After the string is up to pitch and stretched out, you’re ready to remove the 
excess length of string that sticks out from the post. You can snip this excess 
off with wire cutters (if you have them) or bend the string back and forth over 
the same crease until it breaks. Whatever you do, don’t leave the straight 
string length protruding. It could poke you or someone standing next to you 
(such as the bass player) in the eye or give you a sharp jab in your fingertip.
Stringing Nylon-String Guitars
Stringing a nylon-string guitar is different from stringing a steel-string acous-
tic because both the bridge and the posts are different. Nylon-string guitars 
don’t use bridge pins (strings are tied off instead) and their headstocks are 
slotted and have rollers, as opposed to posts.
Changing strings step by step
Nylon strings are easier to deal with than steel strings are, because nylon 
isn’t as springy as steel. Attaching the string to the tuning post, however, can 
be trickier. As you do with the steel-string acoustic, begin by securing the 
bridge end of the string first and then turn your attention to the headstock.
Step 1: Securing the string to the bridge
Whereas steel-string acoustic strings have a ball at one end, nylon strings 
have no such ball: Both ends are loose. (Well, you can buy ball-ended nylon-
string sets, but they’re not what you normally use.) You can, therefore, 
attach either end of the string to the bridge. If the ends look different, how-
ever, use the one that looks like the middle of the string, not the one that has 
the loosely coiled appearance. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Remove the old string, as described in the earlier section “Off with 
the Old: Removing Stressed Strings.”

53
 Chapter 3: Buying and Stringing Guitars
Book I
Guitar 101
 
2. Pass one end of the new string through the hole in the top of the 
bridge, in the direction away from the soundhole, leaving about 11/2 
inches sticking out the rear of the hole.
 
3. Secure the string by bringing the short end over the bridge and pass-
ing it under the long part of the string, as shown in Figure 3-6a. Then 
pass the short end under, over, and then under itself, on the top of the 
bridge, as shown in Figure 3-6b.
 
 You may need a couple of tries to get the end at just the right length, 
where not too much excess is dangling off the top of the bridge. (You 
can always cut the excess away, too.)

of the string.

4. Pull on the long end of the string with one hand and move the knot 
with the other to remove excess slack and cause the knot to lie flat 
against the bridge.
Step 2: Securing the string to the tuning post
On a nylon-string guitar, the tuning posts (called rollers) pass through the 
headstock sideways instead of perpendicularly as on a steel-string acoustic 
or electric guitar. This configuration is known as a slotted headstock.
To attach the string to the tuning post in a slotted headstock, follow these 
steps:

54
Book I: Guitar 101 
 
1. Pass the string through the hole in the tuning post. Bring the end of 
the string back over the roller toward you; then pass the string under 
itself in front of the hole. Pull up on the string end so that the long 
part of the string (the part attached to the bridge) sits in the U-shaped 
loop you just formed, as shown in Figure 3-7a.
 
 Make your loop come from the outside (that is, approaching from the 
left on the lower three bass strings, and from the right on the upper 
three treble strings).
 
2. Pass the short end under and over itself, creating two or three wraps.
 
 Doing so should hold the loose end firmly in place, as shown in Figure 
3-7b, and prevent the string from slipping out of the hole.

3. Wind the peg so the string wraps on top of the loop you just formed, 
forcing it down against the post.
 
4. Pull the string length taut with one hand and turn the tuning peg with 
the other hand.
 
 Wrap the windings to outside of the hole, away from the guitar’s center.
Tuning up
 
As you continue turning the tuning peg, the string slowly comes nearer to 
pitch. Nylon strings, like steel strings, require quite a bit of stretching out, so 
after you get the string initially up to pitch, grab it at various places on its 
length, pull on it, and then tune it up again. Repeat this process two or three 
times to keep the guitar in tune longer. Snip away the excess string after 

55
 Chapter 3: Buying and Stringing Guitars
Book I
Guitar 101
you’re done with all six strings. Nylon strings aren’t as dangerous as steel 
strings if any excess protrudes, but the extra string hanging out is unsightly, 
and classical guitarists are extra-fussy about how their instruments look.
Stringing an Electric Guitar
Generally, electric guitarists need to change their strings more often than 
steel-string acoustic or classical guitarists. Because changing strings is so 
common on electric guitars, builders take a more progressive approach to 
the hardware, often making changing strings very quick and easy.
Changing strings step by step
First secure the string to the bridge and then attach the string to the head-
stock. Electric strings are similar to steel-string acoustic strings in that they 
have ball ends and are made of metal, but electric strings are usually com-
posed of a lighter-gauge wire than steel-string acoustic strings, and the 3rd 
string is unwound, or plain, whereas a steel-string acoustic guitar’s is wound. 
(A nylon-string’s 3rd string also is unwound but is thicker.)
Step 1: Securing the string to the bridge
Most electric guitars use a simple method for securing the string to the 
bridge. You pass the string through a hole in the bridge (sometimes rein-
forced with a collar, or grommet) that’s smaller than the ball at the end 
of the string — so the ball holds the string just as the knot at the end of a 
piece of thread holds a stitch in fabric. On some guitars (such as the Fender 
Telecaster), the collars anchor right into the body, and the strings pass 
through the back of the instrument, through a hole in the bridge assembly, 
and out the top.
Figure 3-8 shows two designs for attaching a string to an electric: from a 
top-mounted bridge and through the back. The following steps show how to 
secure the strings to the bridge.
 
1. Remove the old string, as described in the section “Off with the Old: 
Removing Stressed Strings,” earlier in this chapter.
 
2. Anchor the string at the bridge by passing the string through the hole 
until the ball stops the movement.
 
 Then you focus on the tuning post. You do this on all but a few guitars 
(such as those with a Floyd Rose mechanism — see the end of this 
chapter).

Step 2: Securing the string to the tuning post
In most cases, the posts on an electric resemble those of a steel-string 
acoustic. A post protrudes through the headstock, and you pass your string 
through the post’s hole, kink the string to the inside (toward the center of the 
headstock), and begin winding while holding the long part of the string with 
one hand for control. Refer to Figure 3-4 to see how to kink the string to pre-
pare it for winding and about how much slack to leave.
Some electric guitars, notably Stratocasters and Telecasters, feature string 
retainers, little rollers or channels screwed into the top of the headstock 
that pull the top two or four strings down low onto the headstock, like a 
tent stake. If your guitar has string retainers, make sure you pass the strings 
under them.
Some tuners feature a locking mechanism, so you don’t need to worry about 
winding, slack, and all that bother. Inside the post hole is a viselike device that 
clamps down on the string as it passes through. A knurled (ridge-covered) dial 
underneath the headstock loosens and tightens the vise. Perhaps the best-
known company to make this locking device is Spurzel.

57
 Chapter 3: Buying and Stringing Guitars
Book I
Guitar 101
Some guitars have tuners with slotted posts instead of a hole. These also 
enable quick string changes, because you simply lay the string in the slot at 
the top of the post, kink it, and wind.
The special case of the Floyd Rose bridge
Rock music in the ’80s made extensive use of the whammy bar and float-
ing bridge (where the bridge isn’t fixed, but floats on a spring assembly). 
Standard floating bridges weren’t meant for the kind of abuse that creative 
guitarists such as Steve Vai and Joe Satriani cook up, though, so manufactur-
ers developed better ways to make sure that bridges return to their original 
position and the strings remain in tune.
Floyd Rose invented the most successful of these assemblies. Rose used his 
own patented design to ensure a highly accurate, movable bridge system and 
locking nut (a clamplike device that replaces the standard nut).
 
The bridge takes the strings in a top-mounted approach, instead of through 
the back, but with one notable difference: Guitarists must snip the ball end 
off before attaching the string so the end can fit in the tiny viselike mecha-
nism that holds the string in place. If you own a Floyd, you must carry spare 
strings with the balls snipped off or have wire cutters at the ready.
Because the Floyd Rose also features a locking nut, winding the string on the 
post isn’t so critical. After you lock the nut (by using a small Allen wrench), 
what you do with the tuning pegs doesn’t matter. You then do all tuning by 
using ridge-covered knobs on the bridge. These knobs are known as “fine 
tuners” because their movements are much smaller and more precise than 
are those on the headstock.
Stringing up an electric guitar fitted with a Floyd Rose system takes a 
little longer than it does on a regular electric, but if you plan to do a lot of 
whammy bar work, a Floyd Rose is well worth the effort.

eading music is not necessary to guitar playing, but it is helpful. 
Plenty of great guitarists don’t read a note. But then again, plenty of 
great guitarists read music very well. Knowing how to read music can open 
up many avenues in guitar playing and can provide a new understanding of 
how it all fits together. Let’s put it this way: It sure can’t hurt to read a little 
music. Plus, if you plan to write music, being able to put it down on paper is 
a secure way to have it for good, without worrying about losing that demo 
tape or mp3 file — and it’s also satisfying.
We try in this chapter to make reading music as quick and easy as possible, 
and we give you more than one way to approach the written music examples 
that appear in this book. You can absorb how to play music more quickly if 
you read music even a little bit, rather than not at all. So in this chapter you 
can familiarize yourself with all the written symbols and notation practices 
used in this book — including tablature — so you can better understand the 
written exercises and pieces that appear here and elsewhere.
Knowing the Ropes of Standard 
Music Notation
Standard music notation for guitar is the stuff of clefs, staves, and notes — 
just as you find in music for the violin, flute, piano, trumpet, and saxophone. 
So we start off by introducing the symbols you see when looking at “normal 

60
Book I: Guitar 101 
music.” In the following sections we show you the blank slate on which 
composers record music notation, and we cover the three main elements of 
music: pitch, duration (rhythm), and expression/articulation.
The composer’s canvas: The staff, 
clef, measures, and bar lines
Our current system of writing music has evolved from centuries of different 
approaches, and it’s come a long way since the medieval era. When compos-
ers sit down today to write music, they don’t write on just any old piece of 
paper. The blank canvas for a composer isn’t really totally blank. It’s a series 
of horizontal grids that hold the notes and other music symbols from the 
composer’s pen.
Figure 4-1 shows a blank staff, according to the way any musician first sees 
it, just waiting for a masterpiece to be written on it. The following sections 
explain its components.
 
Figure 4-1: 
A blank staff 
with a treble 
clef, mea-
sures, and 
bar lines.

Measures
Bar lines
Staff
The grid of five horizontal lines and four spaces onto which all notes are 
placed is called a staff. The bottom line is the first line, and the top line is 
the fifth line. The space between the first and second lines is the first space. 
Notes can appear either on a line or in the space between two lines. The 
placement of a note on the staff designates the note’s pitch (how high or low 
it is) and its letter name (C, D, G, and so on).
Clef
The staff appears with a clef (the squiggly thing at the beginning of the line), 
which defines what the pitches are on the lines and spaces. Guitar music 
uses the treble clef, also called the G clef because the curlicue of the clef

 Chapter 4: Deciphering Music Notation and Tablature

Guitar 101
symbol (which looks sort of like a fancy G) wraps around the second line 
from the bottom, which is its way of telling you, “This is G.” You can then find 
any note on the staff by counting up or down the lines and spaces starting 
from G.
Measures and bar lines
Just as you need a staff and a clef to tell you the notes’ pitches, you must 
also have some sort of context in which to place notes in time. Most music 
has a beat, or pulse, that gives the music a basic rhythmic unit that the 
notes play off. (If the notes go fast, it usually means they go fast in relation 
to the beat.)
The beat in turn is usually “felt” in larger groups of two, three, or four; you 
represent this division on the staff with vertical lines that separate the music 
into sections called measures, or bars. The section between two vertical lines 
is a measure (or bar), and the vertical lines themselves are called bar lines. 
Grouping music into measures is a way to keep it manageable by organizing 
the notes into smaller units — units that support the beat’s natural emphasis. 
Measures allow you to keep your place in the music and to break it down into 
smaller chunks for easier digestion.
Pitch: The highs and lows of music
Pitch is the highness or lowness of a note. Music notation uses the staff, the 
clef, and the placement of a note on the staff to show pitch. Take a look at 
Figure 4-2 and Table 4-1 for a breakdown of the various symbols and defini-
tions used for pitch.

Note
A musical symbol whose position on the staff 
indicates its pitch and whose shape indicates its 
duration. The notes on the five lines of the staff 
(from bottom to top) are E, G, B, D, and F. You 
can remember these using the saying “Every 
Good Boy Does Fine.” The notes placed on the 
four spaces in between the lines (from bottom to 
top) spell out the word face (F, A, C, and E).
2
Ledger lines
Notes can fall above or below the staff as well 
as within the staff. To indicate a pitch that falls 
higher or lower than the staff, use ledger lines, 
which you can think of as short, temporary staff 
lines. Note names progress up or down the 
ledger lines (and the spaces between them) 
the same way they do on the staff lines. So, for 
example, the first ledger line below the staff is C, 
and the first ledger line above the staff is A. Try 
counting down two notes from the bottom line E 
and up two notes from the top line F to verify this 
for yourself.
3
Sharps, flats, 
naturals, and 
accidentals
The first seven letters of the alphabet — A 
through G — make up the natural notes in 
music, the white keys of the piano keyboard. In 
between some of the natural notes (white keys) 
are other notes (the black keys) that don’t have 
names of their own. These notes are known 
as sharps or flats and are named according to 
their adjacent natural notes by adding either a 
sharp symbol (#) or flat symbol (%) after the letter 
name. When you see F# in music, you play F one 
half step (one fret) higher than natural F. For a 
note with a flat symbol, such as D%, play the note 
one half step lower than the natural version. A 
natural sign ($) restores a note that’s been modi-
fied by a sharp or flat to its natural state — it 
cancels the sharp or flat. Accidentals are notes 
outside the key (defined by the key signature) 
and are indicated in the music by the appear-
ance of a sharp, flat, or natural sign modifying a 
note. An accidental holds for all the notes of that 
pitch for the rest of the measure.

Key 
signature
The listing of flats or sharps at the beginning 
of the staff, immediately to the right of the clef, 
tells you which notes to play flat or sharp for the 
entirety of the piece (or at least a major section 
of the piece), unless otherwise indicated with 
an accidental. For example, the music in Figure 
4-2 has a key signature of one sharp — F#. That 
means anytime you encounter any F (whether 
in the staff or on a ledger line), you play it a half 
step (one fret) higher. In other words, the key 
signature sends out the loud and clear message: 
“All Fs are hereby sharped until further notice!”
Duration: How long to hold a note 
and what determines rhythm
Although the placement of a note on the staff indicates its pitch, the shape of 
the note indicates its length in time, or duration, in relation to the beat. The 
longer in duration the notes are, the more slowly they move, or the more 
time there is between their respective starting notes. The shorter the notes’ 
values, the faster they come. Without rhythm, notes have no motion. You 
need both pitch and rhythm together to make music.
Rests also pertain to duration; these symbols indicate musical silence and 
have specific values, just as notes do.
You can increase the length of individual notes or rests by placing a dot to 
the right of the note head or rest. You can also increase the length of a note 
by adding a tie, which connects one note to another of the same pitch imme-
diately following it. See Table 4-2, along with other common symbols used 
to indicate duration — the table corresponds to Figure 4-3, which shows the 
symbols in the context of a musical excerpt.

Time 
signature
A two-digit symbol that appears at the 
beginning of the piece that helps you count 
the beats in a measure and tells you which 
beats to stress, or give emphasis to. The top 
number indicates how many beats are in 
each measure, and the bottom number tells 
you what type of note (half, quarter, eighth, 
and so on) gets one beat. For example, in 
3/4 time, you play three beats to the mea-
sure, with the quarter note receiving one 
beat. In 4/4 time, you play four beats to the 
measure, with the quarter note receiving 
the pulse or beat. Knowing how to read 
(and play according to) the time signature 
helps you to capture the feel of the music. 
 
When you tap your foot to the music on the radio, at a concert, or on your 
portable music player, you’re tapping (or stomping or clapping) along to the 
beat. If you count to yourself 1-2-3-4, or 1-2-3 — or however many beats logi-
cally make up one measure of that song or piece — you can figure out the 
time signature. Most popular music is in 4/4, as is most of the music in this 
book. Some song forms are specifically written in a certain time signature. 
For example, a waltz is written in 3/4. So the next time someone says, “Do I 
hear a waltz?” listen and tap along in units of three to tell if that’s correct.
Written high, sounding low
Guitar music is written in treble clef, but the 
actual sound of the pitches you play is an octave 
lower. For example, when you see a third-
space C on the staff, you play the 2nd string, 
1st fret. And you’d be playing the note correctly, 
according to the way guitar players play writ-
ten notes on the treble clef. But just remember 
in the back of your mind somewhere that the 
note you play there actually sounds middle C 
(which is the first ledger line below the staff in 
music for other sound-as-written instruments, 
such as the piano). So the guitar is kind of a 
low-pitched instrument, at least compared with 
instruments that sound as written, such as the 
flute, violin, and oboe. Why is that? Writing the 
actual sounding pitches would be a little more 
awkward to read because it would put so many 
of the notes many ledger lines below the staff.

66
Book I: Guitar 101 
 
The different types of note values relate to the other types of notes. For exam-
ple, a whole note is equal to two half notes, and a half note equals two quarter 
notes. Therefore, a whole note is equal in total duration to four quarter notes. 
Figure 4-4 shows the relative durations of the most common note types.
 
When “playing” a rest on the guitar, you often have to stop a string from ring-
ing. Be careful not to get into the bad habit of looking only where to play notes 
rather than where to “play” or observe rests. When you see a rest, make sure 
that you’re not only not striking a note during that time but also that you stop 
any previously struck string or strings from ringing through the rest.

Expression, articulation, and other symbols
Beyond the primary elements of pitch and duration, you often see other 
symbols and terms in written music. These additional markings give you a 
range of instructions, from how to play the music more expressively to how 
to navigate instructions to repeat a certain passage, and so on. Figure 4-5 and 
Table 4-3 show just some of these expression and articulation (how notes are 
struck) symbols and other markings.

words and terms, such as mf for mezzo-forte 
(medium loud), mp (mezzo-piano, medium 
soft), f (forte, loud), p (piano, soft), ff (fortis-
simo, very loud), and pp (pianissimo, very 
soft).
3
Slur
A curved line between two notes of different 
pitch that tells you to connect the second 
note smoothly to the first. Slurs appear in 
music requiring a legato (ligado in Spanish) 
approach, where the notes blend together in 
a sustained, uninterrupted fashion.
4
Accelerando 
and Ritardando
Instructions that tell you to play gradually 
faster (accelerando, abbreviated accel.) or 
gradually slower (ritardando, abbreviated 
ritard. or rit.).

(diminuendo)
Symbols that resemble open wedges 
(called “hairpins” by some musicians) 
or the abbreviated versions cresc. and 
decresc. (or dim.) that tell you to play 
gradually louder (crescendo) or softer 
(decrescendo, diminuendo).

Accent
A small wedge-shaped or caret-like mark-

Staccato dot
A small dot placed above or below the note 
head that tells you to play the note short and 
detached.

Repeat signs
Special bar-line-type symbols that tell you to 
repeat the measures between the signs.

Ending brackets
Lines that separate different endings in a 
repeated section. In Figure 4-5, play the 
measure under the first ending bracket 
the first time. On the repeat, play only the 
second ending, skipping the first ending.
10
D.C. al Fine
A score direction that tells you to go back 
to the beginning (D.C. stands for Da capo, 
Italian for “from the top”) and play to the 
part marked Fine (Italian for “end”). D.C. al 
Coda tells you to go back to the beginning 
and play until you see the words To Coda. 
Then skip to the part of the music marked 
Coda (which indicates the final part of the 
music — coda is Italian for “tail”) with the 
coda symbol (which resembles a set of 
crosshairs or a cross covering an oval). D.S. 
(for dal segno, or “from the sign”) tells you 
to go back to the sign (a slanted, stylized 
s with two dots on either side and a slash 
bisecting the s).
11
Double bar lines
Two bar lines spaced close together, indi-
cating the end of a section or, if the lines are 
a combination of a thick and thin pair, the 
end of a piece.

Guitar 101
Relating the Notes on the 
Staff to the Fretboard
Guitarists are no different from other musicians when dealing with written 
music in that after they identify and understand the symbols of standard 
music notation, they have to relate them to their instrument. And by “relate,” 
we mean play. At the most basic level — executing the correct pitch and 
rhythm — you must be able to play the note you see on the staff correctly on 
the guitar.
Associating a note on the staff with a string and fret location (even if the fret 
is zero — meaning an open string) is the first step to reading music on the 
guitar. A good way to begin associating notes on the staff as they relate to the 
guitar is to consider the pitches of the open strings, as shown in Figure 4-6.
 
Figure 4-6: 
The pitches 
of the open 
strings.
 
EADGBE
 
You can use these pitches to help tune your guitar to a piano or other fixed-
pitch source. See Chapter 1 in Book I for more on tuning your guitar.
To help you correlate the notes of the treble clef with the frets on the guitar, 
check out Figure 4-7, which shows notes from E to F on the staff as they cor-
respond to the fingerboard. Don’t worry about playing anything yet — just 
get used to the idea that when you see, for example, an E on the 1st (lowest) 
line of the treble clef, it corresponds to the 4th string, 2nd fret.
 
Figure 4-7: 
The notes 
on the staff 
correspond-
ing to the 
frets on the 
fingerboard.
 

70
Book I: Guitar 101 
Figure 4-8 shows the entire range of notes (including sharps and flats) on the 
guitar on the treble clef using ledger lines above and below the staff. All 12 
frets of each of the six strings are shown on the staff, which allows you to see 
how to play some pitches on multiple strings. The lowest possible note is the 
open low-E string, three ledger lines and a space below the treble staff. The 
highest note is E, three ledger lines above the staff.
 
Though the notes extend off the staff in each direction by at least three 
ledger lines (see “Ledger lines” in Table 4-1 for more info), in reality you 
rarely have to deal with notes higher than the high E that occurs three ledger 
lines above the staff. (You play this note on the 1st string, 12th fret.) 
However, the low part of the guitar’s range — from the open low E on up — 
sees a lot of action, so be sure you get familiar with those pitches, because 
you’ll be playing them quite a bit.
Guitar-Specific Notation
Guitarists who read standard music notation observe all symbols and 
practices regarding clefs, staves (plural of staff), pitches, and rhythms that 
other musicians do. But music written specifically for guitar also employs 
additional symbols that instruct you to perform the music in certain ways. 
If these symbols appear, observing them helps you perform the music in an 
easier, more efficient way, or enables you to better realize the composer or 
arranger’s intent.
These extra symbols don’t change anything regarding the pitch or rhythm; 
their purpose is to instruct you on how to perform the piece in the best way. 
In the following sections, we explore some symbols you encounter only in 
music written for guitar.
Fingering indications for 
the right and left hands
If you see little numbers and letters in the treble staff, it usually means some-
one (the composer or arranger, a teacher, or the editor of the music) has gone 
through and thoughtfully provided you with the suggested, the best, or even the 
only possible working fingering indications. Fingering is the term guitarists use 
for the choice, or assignment, of specific fingers to play a given note or passage 
of notes. And in classical guitar especially, the issue of fingering comes up a lot.

Numbers without circles appearing next to or near note heads tell you which 
left-hand fingers to use, as follows: 1 = index finger; 2 = middle finger; 3 = ring 
finger; and 4 = little finger. (You don’t use the left-hand thumb in fingering.) 
Letters above or below notes indicate right-hand fingers, with the letters 
signifying the Spanish words for the thumb and the index, middle, and ring 
fingers: p = thumb (pulgar); i = index (índice); m = middle (medio); and a = 
ring (anular). Except for some special percussive techniques and in flamenco 
style, you don’t use the right-hand little finger. Figure 4-9 shows a passage 
of music with some left- and right-hand fingering indications. Note that the 
right-hand pattern continues in both measures.

Sometimes you have to use the same left-hand finger to fret two consecutive 
notes on the same string at different frets. This requires you to actually move 
your left hand up or down the neck. Keeping your finger in contact with the 
string as you move to the new fret helps to guide your left hand. The guide 
finger is indicated in notation with a short, straight line appearing to the left 
of the second of the two finger numbers, slanting in the direction of the left-
hand movement (up or down). Figure 4-10 shows the first finger acting as a 
guide finger moving down one fret from A to A%.

Unlike the piano, where each note on the staff indicates one and only one 
piano key, the guitar fretboard often provides more than one place to play 
a given note. For example, you can play the second line G on the open 3rd 
string or on the 4th string at the 5th fret. If the music requires you to play a 
note or passage of notes on a certain string, you see a number inside a circle, 
which indicates the string. For example, if you must play a second-line G on 
the 4th string (instead of as an open 3rd string), you see a 4 inside a circle. 
Figure 4-11 shows a passage that’s playable only if you take the downstem G 
on the 4th string, 5th fret, with your thumb.

Stepping up to the barre
You often have to fret more than one string at a time at the same fret, and 
you do this by taking a finger and flattening it out to form a “bar” — or, as it’s 
known in guitar lingo, barre (Chapter 3 in Book II tells you how). You may see 
various ways to indicate a barre in guitar music, but here we use a capital C 
(for the Spanish ceja or cejilla) for a full barre (all six strings) and a C with a 
vertical line bisecting it for a half or partial barre (fewer than six strings). A 
Roman numeral tells you which fret to place the barre on, and a dotted line 
indicates the number of beats you must hold the barre in place to success-
fully execute the passage underneath it. Figure 4-12 shows how barre nota-
tion appears in guitar music.

Taking on tablature, a nice complement 
to standard notation
Sometimes a tablature staff (called “tab” for short) is added to the standard 
notation staff. Tablature looks kind of like normal music notation but it’s not. 
Tablature is a six-line staff that represents the guitar fretboard (see Figure 
4-13). Note that each line represents a string of the guitar, with the top line 
corresponding to the 1st (high-E) string and the bottom line corresponding 
to the 6th (low-E) string. A number on a line provides the fret location for 
that note. (Tablature doesn’t tell you which finger to use, but you may be 
able to get that information from the standard music staff.)

Remember when we said that all musicians have to be able to understand the 
symbols of standard music notation and then relate them to their instrument? 
Tablature skips that step! You can use tab right away, with no previous expe-
rience in reading music. However, tab is more limited than standard music 
notation. For one thing, it works only for guitar, so it doesn’t teach you the 
more universal skill of reading music, and it doesn’t indicate rhythm.
 
Tab does, however, work very well in conjunction with the standard music 
staff. All the notes in the tab staff align vertically with the notes appearing 
above in the standard music staff. If you’re ever unsure as to where to play a 
note appearing in the music staff, all you need to do is shoot your eyes 
straight down to the corresponding string-and-fret location in the tab staff. 
Conversely, if you find yourself in the tab staff and you’re uncertain of what’s 
supposed to be happening with regard to rhythms or rests, take a quick trip 
uptown to see how that passage is displayed in the music staff. Figure 4-14 
shows how the notes on the standard music notation staff relate to the tab 
staff and vice versa.

Chapter 1
Basic Major and Minor Chords
In This Chapter
 Playing the basic guitar chords
 Playing songs with basic major and minor chords
 Sweatin’ to the oldies progression
A
ccompanying yourself as you sing your favorite songs is one of the 
best ways to pick up basic guitar chords. If you know how to play basic 
chords, you can play lots of popular songs right away — from “Skip to My 
Lou” to “Louie Louie.”
In this chapter, the major and minor chords are organized into families. A 
family of chords is simply a group of related chords. They’re related because 
you often use these chords together to play songs. The concept is sort of like 
color-coordinating your clothing or creating a balanced meal. Chords in a 
family go together like peanut butter and jelly (except that chords in a family 
are less messy). Along the way, you expand your guitar-notation vocabulary 
as you start to develop your chord-playing and strumming skills.
 
Think of a family of chords as a plant. One of the chords — the one that feels 
like home base in a song (usually the chord you start and end a song with) — 
is the plant’s root, and the other chords in the family are the different shoots 
rising up from that same root. Together, the root and shoots make up the 
family. Put ’em all together and you have a lush garden . . . er, make that a 
song. By the way, the technical term for a family is key. So you can say, “This 
song uses A-family chords,” or “This song is in the key of A.”
Playing Chords in the A Family
The A family is a popular one for playing songs on the guitar because, like 
other families in this chapter, its chords are easy to play. That’s because 
A-family chords contain open strings (strings that you play without pressing 
down any frets). Chords that contain open strings are called open chords, or 
open-position chords. Listen to “Fire and Rain,” by James Taylor, to hear the 
sound of a song that uses A-family chords.

78
Book II: Sounds and Techniques 
The basic chords in the A family are A, D, and E. Each of these chords is 
what’s known as a major chord. A chord that’s named by a letter name alone, 
such as these (A, D, and E), is always major.
Fingering A-family chords
When fingering chords, you use the “ball” of your fingertip, placing it just 
behind the fret (on the side toward the tuning pegs). Arch your fingers so the 
fingertips fall perpendicular to the neck. And make sure your left-hand fin-
gernails are short so they don’t prevent you from pressing the strings all the 
way down to the fingerboard. Figure 1-1 shows the fingering for the A, D, and 
E chords — the basic chords in the A family. (If you’re unclear about reading 
chord diagrams, check out Chapter 2 in Book I.)
 
Don’t play any strings marked with an X (the 6th string on the A chord and 
the 5th and 6th strings on the D chord). Strike just the top five (5th through 
1st) strings in the A chord and the top four (4th through 1st) strings in the D 
chord. Selectively striking strings may be awkward at first, but keep at it and 
you’ll get the hang of it. If you play a string marked with an X and we catch 
you, we’ll revoke your picking privileges on the spot.

Strumming A-family chords
Use your right hand to strum these A-family chords with a pick, your thumb, 
or the back of your fingernails (in a brushing motion toward the floor). Start 
strumming from the lowest-pitched string of the chord (the top-most as you 
hold the guitar) and strum toward the floor.
A chord progression is a series of chords that you play one after the other. 
Figure 1-2 presents a simple progression in the key of A and instructs you to 
strum each chord — in the order shown (reading from left to right) — four 
times. Use all downstrokes (dragging your pick across the strings toward the 
floor) as you play. Listen to Track 2 to hear the rhythm of this progression 
and try to play along with it.

Playing callusly
Playing chords can be a little painful at first. 
(We mean for you, not for people within 
earshot; c’mon, we’re not that cruel.) No matter 
how tough you are, if you’ve never played guitar 
before, your left-hand fingertips are soft. Fretting 
a guitar string, therefore, is going to hurt.
This situation isn’t weird at all — in fact, it’s quite 
normal for beginning guitarists. (Well, it’s weird 
if you enjoy the pain.) You must develop nice, 
thick calluses on your fingertips before playing 
the guitar can ever feel completely comfortable. 
You may take weeks or even months to build up 
those protective layers of dead skin, depending 
on how much and how often you play. But after 
you finally earn your calluses, you never lose 
them (completely, anyway). Like a Supreme 
Court justice, you’re a guitar player for life.
You can develop calluses by playing the basic 
chords in this chapter over and over again. As 
you progress, you also gain strength in your 
hands and fingers, and become more comfort-
able in general while playing the guitar. Before 
you know it’s happening, fretting a guitar 
becomes as natural to you as shaking hands 
with your best friend.
As with any physical-conditioning routine, stop 
and rest if you feel tenderness or soreness in 
your fingers or hands. Building up calluses 
takes time, and you can’t hurry time (or love, for 
that matter, as Diana Ross would attest).

80
Book II: Sounds and Techniques 
After strumming each chord four times, you come to a vertical line in the music 
that follows the four strum symbols. This is a bar line. It’s not something that 
you play. Bar lines visually separate the music into smaller sections known as 
measures, or bars. (You can use these terms interchangeably; they both mean 
the same thing.) Measures make written music easier to grasp because they 
break up the music into little, digestible chunks. (See Chapter 4 in Book I for 
more on the basics of the musical staff.)
Don’t hesitate or stop at the bar line. Keep your strumming speed the same 
throughout, even as you play “between the measures” — that is, in the imagi-
nary “space” from the end of one measure to the beginning of the next that 
the bar line represents. Start out playing as slowly as necessary to help you 
keep the beat steady. You can always speed up as you become more confi-
dent and proficient in your chord fingering and switching.
By playing a progression over and over, you start to develop left-hand strength 
and calluses on your fingertips. If you want to play a song right away, you can. 
Skip to the section “Playing Songs with Basic Major and Minor Chords,” at the 
end of this chapter. Because you now know the basic open chords in the A 
family, you can play “Kumbaya.” Rock on!
Playing Chords in the D Family
The basic chords that make up the D family are D, Em (pronounced “E 
minor”), G, and A. The D family, therefore, shares two basic open chords with 
the A family (D and A) and introduces two new ones: Em and G. Because you 
already know how to play D and A from the preceding section, you need to 
work on only two more chords to add the entire D family to your repertoire: 
Em and G. Listen to “Here Comes the Sun,” by the Beatles (from Abbey Road), 
to hear a song that uses D-family chords.
Minor describes the quality of a type of chord. A minor chord has a sound 
that’s distinctly different from that of a major chord. You may characterize 
the sound of a minor chord as sad, mournful, scary, or even ominous.
 
The relationship of the notes that make up the chord determines a chord’s 
quality. A chord that’s named by a capital letter followed by a small “m” is 
always minor.

Fingering D-family chords
Figure 1-3 shows you how to finger the two basic chords in the D family that 
aren’t in the A family. You may notice that none of the strings in either chord 
diagram displays an X symbol, so you get to strike all the strings whenever 
you play a G or Em chord. Go ahead and celebrate by dragging your pick or 
right-hand fingers across the strings in a big keraaaang.

Chord qualities
Chords have different qualities, which has 
nothing to do with whether they’re good or 
bad little chords. You can define quality as the 
relationship between the different notes that 
make up the chord — or simply, what the chord 
sounds like.
Besides major, other chord qualities include 
minor, 7th, minor 7th, and major 7th. The follow-
ing list describes chord qualities:
  Major chords: These are simple chords that 
have a stable, positive sound.
  Minor chords: These are simple chords that 
have a soft, sometimes sad sound.
  7th chords: These are bluesy, funky-sounding 
chords.
  Minor 7th chords: These chords sound 
mellow and jazzy.
  Major 7th chords: These chords sound 
bright and jazzy.
Each type of chord, or chord quality, has a dif-
ferent kind of sound, and you can often distin-
guish the chord type just by hearing it. Listen, 
for example, to the sound of a major chord by 
strumming A, D, and E. (For more on 7th, minor 
7th, and major 7th chords, check out Chapter 2 
in Book II.)

82
Book II: Sounds and Techniques 
 
Try the following trick to quickly pick up how to play Em and to hear the 
difference between the major and minor chord qualities: Play E, which is a 
major chord, and then lift your index finger off the 3rd string. Now you’re 
playing Em, which is the minor-chord version of E. By alternating, you can 
easily hear the difference in quality between a major and minor chord.
 
Also, notice the alternative fingering for G (2-3-4 instead of 1-2-3). As your 
hand gains strength and becomes more flexible, you want to switch to the 
2-3-4 fingering instead of the initially easier 1-2-3 fingering. Why? You can 
switch to other chords faster using the 2-3-4 fingering for G.
Strumming D-family chords
In Figure 1-4, you play a simple chord progression using D-family chords. 
Notice the difference in the strum in this figure versus that of Figure 1-2. In 
Figure 1-2, you strum each chord four times per measure. Each strum is one 
pulse, or beat. Figure 1-4 divides the second strum of each measure (or the 
second beat) into two strums — up and down — both of which together take 
up the time of one beat, meaning that you must play each strum in beat 2 
twice as quickly as you do a regular strum.
Practicing and getting good
It may sound obvious to say that the more you 
practice, the better you’ll get, but it’s true. 
Perhaps even better is this: The more you 
practice, the faster you’ll get good. Although 
there’s no set amount of practice time for “get-
ting good,” a good rule of thumb is to practice a 
minimum of 30 minutes every day. Also, it’s gen-
erally agreed that practicing at regular intervals 
is better than jamming a week’s worth of time 
(say, 3 1/2 hours) into one practice session.
If at first you find a new technique difficult to 
master, stick with it, and you’ll eventually get 
the hang of it. To get even better on the guitar, 
try the following:
  Set aside a certain time every day for 
practicing.
  Work on one or two goals at a time, such as 
learning a piece and an exercise.
  Get together with your guitar-playing 
friends and get them to listen to what you’re 
doing.
  Create a practice environment where you 
have privacy and are away from distrac-
tions (TV, conversations, your mother bug-
ging you to come to dinner, and so on).
  Watch videos of guitar players who play the 
kind of music you like and want to learn.

The additional symbol 2 with the strum symbol means that you strum down 
(hitting the lower strings first), and 4 means you strum up. The term sim. is 
an abbreviation of the Italian word simile, which instructs you to keep playing in 
a similar manner — in this case to keep strumming in a down, down-up, down, 
down pattern.
 
If you’re playing fingerstyle (strumming with your fingers), play upstrokes 
with the back of your thumbnail whenever you see the symbol 4.
Knowing the basic open chords in the D family (D, Em, G, and A) enables you 
to play a song in the key of D right now. If you skip to the section “Playing 
Songs with Basic Major and Minor Chords,” later in this chapter, you can play 
the song “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot” right now. Go for it!
Playing Chords in the G Family
By tackling related chord families (as A, D, and G are), you carry over your 
knowledge from family to family in the form of chords that you already know 
from earlier families. The basic chords that make up the G family are G, Am, 
C, D, and Em. If you already know G, D, and Em (which we describe in the pre-
ceding sections on the A and D families), you can now try Am and C. Listen to 
“You’ve Got a Friend,” as played by James Taylor, to hear the sound of a song 
that uses G-family chords.
Fingering G-family chords
In Figure 1-5, you see the fingerings for Am and C, the new chords that you 
need to play in the G family. Notice that the fingering of these two chords is 
similar: Each has finger 1 on the 2nd string, 1st fret, and finger 2 on the 4th 

84
Book II: Sounds and Techniques 
string, 2nd fret. In moving between these chords, keep these first two fingers 
in place. Switching chords is always easier if you don’t need to move all your 
fingers to new positions. The notes that different chords share are known as 
common tones. Notice the X over the 6th string in each of these chords. Don’t 
play that string while strumming either C or Am. (We mean it!)

you to play a song in the key of G right now. Skip to the section “Playing

play “Auld Lang Syne.”

Playing Chords in the C Family
The last chord family we need to discuss is C. Some people say that C is the 
easiest key to play in. C is sort of the music-theory square one — the point 
at which everything (and, usually, everyone) begins in music. The C family 
is placed last in this chapter because it has lots of chords in its family — too 
many to master all at once.
 
The basic chords that make up the C family are C, Dm, Em, F, G, and Am. If 
you practice the preceding sections on the A-, D-, and G-family chords, you 
know C, Em, G, and Am. So in this section, you need to pick up only two more 
chords: Dm and F. “Dust in the Wind” by Kansas and “The Boxer” by Simon 
and Garfunkel use C-family chords.
Fingering C-family chords
In Figure 1-7, you see the new chords that you need to play in the C family. 
Note that both Dm and F have the second finger on the 3rd string, 2nd fret. 
Hold this common tone down as you switch between these two chords.

Dm

F
3211
Many people find F the most difficult chord to play of the basic chords. 
That’s because F uses no open strings, and it also requires a barre. A barre is 
what you’re playing whenever you press down two or more strings at once 
with a single left-hand finger. To play the F chord, you use your first finger to 
press down both the 1st and 2nd strings at the 1st fret simultaneously.

86
Book II: Sounds and Techniques 
 
You must exert extra finger pressure to play a barre. At first, you may find 
that, as you strum the F chord (hitting the top four strings only, as the Xs in 
the chord diagram indicate), you hear buzzes or muffled strings. Experiment 
with various placements of your index finger. Try adjusting the angle of your 
finger or rotating it on its side. Keep trying until you find a position for the 
first finger that enables all four strings to ring clearly as you strike them.
Strumming C-family chords
Figure 1-8 shows a simple chord progression using C-family chords. Play the 
progression over and over to get used to switching among the chords in this 
family and, of course, to help build up those nasty little calluses.

Track 2, 1:10
 
Look at Figure 1-8. Notice the small curved line joining the second half of beat 
2 to beat 3. This line is known as a tie. A tie tells you not to strike the second 
note of the two tied notes (in this case, the one on beat 3). Instead, just keep 
holding the chord on that beat (letting it ring) without restriking it with your 
right hand.
Listen to Track 2 on the CD to hear the sound of this strumming pattern. This 
slightly jarring rhythmic effect is an example of syncopation. In syncopation, 
the musician either strikes a note (or chord) where you don’t expect to hear 
it or fails to strike where you do expect to hear it.
 
You probably expect to strike notes on the beats (1, 2, 3, 4). In the example 
in Figure 1-8, however, you strike no chord on beat 3. That variation in the 
strumming pattern makes the chord on beat 2½ feel as if it’s accentuated 
(or accented). This accentuation interrupts the normal (expected) pulse of 
the music, resulting in syncopation. Syncopation breaks up the regular pattern 
of beats and presents an element of surprise in music. The balance between 
expectation and surprise is what holds a listener’s interest.

To play a song that uses C-family chords right now, skip to the song “Michael, 
Row the Boat Ashore,” in the section “Playing Songs with Basic Major and

Playing Songs with Basic 
Major and Minor Chords
This section is where the real music happens — you know, songs. If the titles 
here hark back to bygone campfire days of your youth, fear not. These songs, 
although seemingly simple, illustrate universal principles that carry over 
into the — shall we say it? — hipper musical genres. Pick up these songs, and 
you’ll be playing the music of your choice in no time.
 
You may notice that all the strumming examples that we provide in this chap-
ter are only four measures long. Must all of your exercises be limited this 
way? No, but songwriters do commonly write in four-measure phrases. So the 
length of these exercises prepares you for actual passages in real songs. You 
may also notice that each strumming example is in 4/4 time, which means 
that each measure has four beats. Most popular songs contain four beats per 
measure, so the 4/4 time signature in the exercises also prepares you to play 
actual songs. (See Chapter 4 in Book I for more on time signatures.)
In this section of actual songs, you sometimes play a single chord for more 
than a measure, and sometimes you change chords within a single measure. 
Listen to the CD to hear the rhythm of the chord changes as you follow the 
beat numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) that appear below the guitar staff.
 
After you can comfortably play your way through these songs, try to memorize 
them. That way, you don’t need to stare into a book as you’re trying to develop 
your rhythm.
If you get bored with these songs — or with the way you play these songs — 
have a guitar-playing friend play the same songs by using the strumming pat-
terns and chord positions indicated. Listening to someone else play helps you 
hear the songs objectively, and if your friend has a little flair, you may pick up 
a cool little trick or two. Work on infusing a bit of personality into all of your 
playing, even if you’re just strumming a simple folk song.
Here’s some special information to help you play the songs in this section:
 
 Kumbaya: To play “Kumbaya” (the ultimate campfire song), you need to 
know how to play A, D, and E chords; how to strum using downstrokes; 
and how to start a fire by using only two sticks, a magnifying glass, and 
some dried leaves.

88
Book II: Sounds and Techniques 
 
 The first measure in this song is known as a pickup measure, which starts 
the song with one or more beats missing — in this case, the first two. 
During the pickup measure, the guitar part shows a rest, or a musical 
silence. Don’t play during the rest; begin playing on the syllable “ya” on 
beat 1. Notice, too, that the last bar is missing two beats — beats 3 and 4. 
The missing beats in the last measure enable you to repeat the pickup 
measure in repeated playings of the song, and to make that measure, com-
bined with the first incomplete one, total the requisite four beats.
 
 Swing Low, Sweet Chariot: To play “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot” you 
need to know how to play D, Em, G, and A chords; how to play down and 
down-up strums; and how to sing like James Earl Jones.
 
 This song starts with a one-beat pickup, and the guitar rests for that 
beat. Notice that beat 2 of measures 2, 4, and 6 has two strums instead 
of one. Strum those beats down and then up (2 and 4) with each strum 
twice as fast as a regular strum.
 
 Auld Lang Syne: To play “Auld Lang Syne” you need to know how to 
play G, Am, C, D, and Em chords; how to play down and down-up strums; 
and maybe what “Auld Lang Syne” means.
 
 Measure 8 is a little tricky, because you play three different chords in 
the same measure (Em, Am, and D). In the second half of the measure, you 
change chords on each beat — one stroke per chord. Practice playing only 
measure 8 slowly, over and over. Then play the song. Note: In changing 
between G and C (bars 4–6 and 12–19), fingering G with fingers 2, 3, and 
4 instead of 1, 2, and 3 makes the chord switch easier — the second and 
third fingers form a shape that simply moves one string.
 
 Michael, Row the Boat Ashore: To play “Michael, Row the Boat Ashore” 
you need to know how to play C, Dm, Em, F, and G chords and how to 
play a syncopated eighth-note strum.
 
 The strumming pattern here is syncopated. The strum that normally 
occurs on beat 3 is anticipated — it comes half a beat early. This kind 
of syncopation gives the song a Latin feel. Listen to the CD to hear the 
strumming rhythm. Remember, on the Dm and F chords, you don’t strum 
the lowest two strings (the 6th and 5th). For the C chord, don’t strum the 
bottom string (the 6th).

Strumming the “Oldies” Progression
One cool thing you can do right now is play oldies — songs from the late 
’50s and early ’60s such as “Earth Angel” and “Duke of Earl.” These songs 
are based on what’s sometimes called the oldies progression, a series of four 
chords repeated over and over.
 
You can play the oldies progression in any key, but the best guitar keys for the 
oldies progression are C and G. In the key of C, the four chords that make up 
the progression are C-Am-F-G. In G, the chords are G-Em-C-D. Try strumming the 
progression in each key by playing four down-strums per chord. Play the four 
chords over and over, in the sequence given.
The fun begins as you sing oldies while accompanying yourself with the 
oldies progression. You’ll find that one of the keys (C or G) better suits your 
vocal range, so use that key. Playing oldies can become addicting, but the 
good news is that you build up your calluses very quickly.
For some songs, you play four one-beat strums per chord; for others, you 
play eight, or two. Following are songs you can play with the oldies progres-
sion right now. How many times you strum each chord is noted next to each 
song title. Don’t forget to sing. Have fun!
 
 All I Have to Do Is Dream: Two strums per chord.
 
 Blue Moon: Two strums per chord.
 
 Breaking Up Is Hard to Do: Two strums per chord.
 
 Come Go with Me: Two strums per chord.

Adding Spice: Basic 7th Chords
In This Chapter
 Playing dominant 7th chords
 Playing minor 7th chords
 Playing major 7th chords
 Playing songs that use 7th chords
I
n this chapter, you begin to play what are known as open-position 7th chords. 
Seventh chords are no more difficult to play than the simple major or minor 
chords described in Chapter 1 in Book II, but their sound is more complex than 
that of major and minor chords (because they’re made up of four different 
notes instead of three), and their usage in music is a little more specialized.
The situation’s kind of like that of the knives in your kitchen. Any big, sharp 
knife can cut both a pizza and a pineapple, but if you spend a lot of time 
doing either, you figure out that you need to use the circular-bladed gizmo 
for the pizza and a cleaver for the pineapple. These utensils may not be as 
versatile or as popular as your general-purpose knives, but if you’re making 
Hawaiian-style pizza, nothing beats ’em. The more your culinary skills develop, 
the more you appreciate specialized cutlery. And the more your ear skills 
develop, the more you understand where to substitute 7th chords for the more 
ordinary major and minor chords. The different 7th chords can make the blues 
sound “bluesy” and jazz sound “jazzy.”
Seventh chords come in several varieties, and each type has a different 
sound, or quality. In this chapter, you meet the three most important types of 
7th chords that you encounter in playing the guitar: dominant 7th, minor 7th, 
and major 7th.
Dominant 7th Chords
Dominant seems a funny, technical name for a chord that’s called a plain 
“seven” if you group it with a letter-name chord symbol. If you talk about a C7 
or A7 chord, for example, you’re referring to a dominant 7th chord.

96
Book II: Sounds and Techniques 
 
Actually, the term dominant refers to the 5th degree of a major scale — but 
don’t worry about the theory.
The important thing is that you call the chords “dominant sevenths” merely 
to distinguish them from other types of 7th chords (minor 7ths and major 
7ths). Note, too, that dominant has nothing whatsoever to do with leather 
and studded collars. You can hear the sound of dominant 7ths in such songs 
as Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs’ “Wooly Bully” and the Beatles’ “I Saw Her 
Standing There.”
D7, G7, and C7
The D7, G7, and C7 chords are among the most common of the open domi-
nant 7ths. Figure 2-1 shows you diagrams of these three chords that guitar-
ists often use together to play songs.
 
If you already know how to play C (which is introduced in Chapter 1 in Book II), 
you can form C7 by simply adding your pinky on the 3rd string (at the 3rd fret).
Notice the Xs above the 5th and 6th strings on the D7 chord. Don’t play those 
strings as you strum. Similarly, for the C7 chord, don’t play the 6th string as 
you strum.

Sounds and

Practice strumming D7, G7, and C7. You don’t need written music for this 
exercise, so you’re on the honor system to do it. Try strumming D7 four 
times, G7 four times, and then C7 four times. You want to accustom your left 
hand to the feel of the chords themselves and to switching among them.
If you want to play a song right now using these new chords, skip to the 
section “Playing Songs with 7th Chords,” later in this chapter. You can play 
“Home on the Range” with the chords you know right now.
E7 and A7
Two more 7th chords that you often use together to play songs are the E7 
and A7 chords. Figure 2-2 shows how you play these two open 7th chords.
 
If you know how to play E (check out Chapter 1 in Book II), you can form E7 
by simply removing your third finger from the 4th string.

E7 and A7.

This version of the E7 chord, as Figure 2-2 shows, uses only two fingers. You 
can also play an open position E7 chord with four fingers (as we describe in 
the following section). For now, however, play the two-finger version because 
it’s easier to fret quickly, especially if you’re just starting out.
Practice E7 and A7 by strumming each chord four times, switching back and 
forth between them. Remember to avoid striking the 6th string on the A7 chord.
If you want to play a song that uses these two open 7th chords right now, 
skip to the section “Playing Songs with 7th Chords,” later in this chapter, and 
play “All Through the Night.”
E7 (four-finger version) and B7
Two more popular open-position 7th chords are the four-finger version of 
E7 and the B7 chord. Figure 2-3 shows you how to finger the four-finger E7 
and the B7 chords. Most people think that this E7 has a better voicing (vertical 

98
Book II: Sounds and Techniques 
arrangement of notes) than does the two-finger E7. You often use the B7 chord 
along with E7 to play certain songs. Remember to avoid striking the 6th string 
on the B7 chord.
 
If you already know how to play E, you can form this E7 by simply adding 
your pinky on the 2nd string (at the 3rd fret).

Practice these chords by strumming each one four times, switching back and 
forth. As you do so, notice that your second finger plays the same note at the 
same fret in each chord — the one at the 2nd fret of the 5th string. This note 
is a common tone (that is, it’s common to both chords). In switching back 
and forth between the two chords, keeping this finger down on the 5th string 
makes switching easier. Note: Always hold down common tones whenever 
you’re switching chords. They provide an anchor of stability for your left hand.
To use these chords in a song right now, skip to the section “Playing Songs 
with 7th Chords,” later in this chapter, and play “Over the River and Through 
the Woods.”
Minor 7th Chords: Dm7, Em7, and Am7
Minor 7th chords differ from dominant 7th chords in that their character is a 
little softer and jazzier. Minor 7th chords are what you hear in “Moondance” 
by Van Morrison and the verses of “Light My Fire” by the Doors. Figure 2-4 
shows diagrams for the three open-position minor 7th (m7) chords.
Notice that the Dm7 uses a two-string barre — that is, you press down two 
strings with a single finger (the first finger, in this case) at the 1st fret. Angling 
your finger slightly or rotating it on its side may help you fret those notes firmly 
and eliminate any buzzes as you play the chord. The 6th and 5th strings have 
Xs above them. Don’t strike those strings while strumming.

You finger the Am7 chord much as you do the C chord that’s explained in 
Chapter 1 in Book II; just lift your third finger off a C chord — and you have 
Am7. In switching between C and Am7 chords, remember to hold down the 
two common tones with your first and second fingers to switch between 
the chords much more quickly. And if you know how to play an F chord (see 
Chapter 1 in Book II), you can form Dm7 simply by removing your third finger.
Major 7th Chords: Cmaj7, 
Fmaj7, Amaj7, and Dmaj7
Major 7th chords differ from dominant 7th chords and minor 7th chords in 
that their character is bright and jazzy. You can hear this kind of chord at the 
beginning of “Ventura Highway” by America and “Don’t Let the Sun Catch You 
Crying” by Gerry and the Pacemakers. Figure 2-5 shows four open-position 
major 7th (maj7) chords. (For more major 7th chords, check out Appendix A.)
Notice that Dmaj7 uses a three-string barre with the first finger. Rotating the 
first finger slightly on its side makes it easier to play. Don’t play the 5th or 6th 
strings as you strike the Dmaj7 or Fmaj7 (see the Xs in the diagrams in 
Figure 2-5). And don’t play the 6th string on the Amaj7 or Cmaj7.

In moving between Cmaj7 and Fmaj7, notice that the second and third fingers 
move as a fixed shape across the strings in switching between these chords. 
The first finger doesn’t fret any string in a Cmaj7 chord, but keep it curled 
and poised above the 1st fret of the 2nd string so you can bring it down 
quickly for the switch to Fmaj7.
Practice moving back and forth (strumming four times each) between Cmaj7 
and Fmaj7 and between Amaj7 and Dmaj7.
Playing Songs with 7th Chords
Listen to the CD to hear the rhythm of the strums of the songs in this section 
as you follow the slash notation in the guitar part. If you have difficulty remem-
bering how to finger the chords, refer to the earlier sections in this chapter, 
check out the Cheat Sheet in the front of the book, or consult Appendix A. 
Don’t try to play the vocal line. It’s there only as a reference.
Here is some useful information about the songs to help you along:
 
 Home on the Range: To play “Home on the Range,” you need to know 
how to play C, C7, F, D7, and G7 chords; how to play a “bass strum 
strum” pattern; and how to wail like a coyote.

101
 Chapter 2: Adding Spice: Basic 7th Chords
Book II
Sounds and 
Techniques
 
 In the music, you see the words Bass strum strum over the rhythm 
slashes. Instead of simply strumming the chord for three beats, play 
only the lowest note of the chord on the first beat and then strum the 
remaining notes of the chord on beats 2 and 3. The sim. means to keep 
playing this pattern throughout.
 
 All Through the Night: To play “All Through the Night,” you need to 
know how to play D, G, E7, and A7 chords; how to read repeat signs; and 
how to stay awake during this intensely somnolent ditty. Use the two-
finger E7 for this song.
 
 In the music, you see repeat signs (two dots that look like a colon) that 
tell you to play certain measures twice. In this case, you play measures 
1, 2, 3, 4, and then measures 1, 2, 3, 5.
 
 Over the River and Through the Woods: To play “Over the River and 
Through the Woods,” you need to know how to play A, D, E7, and B7 
chords; how to strum in 6/8 time; and the way to Grandma’s house (in 
case your horse stumbles and you need to shoot it). Use the four-finger 
E7 for this song.
 
 The 6/8 time signature has a lilting feel to it — sort of as though the 
music has a gallop or limp. “When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again” 
is another familiar song played in 6/8 time. Count only two beats per 
measure — not six (unless you want to sound like a rabbit that’s had 
three cups of coffee).
 
 It’s Raining, It’s Pouring: To play “It’s Raining, It’s Pouring,” you need to 
know how to play Amaj7 and Dmaj7 chords and how to sing in a really 
whiny, annoying voice. Use all downstrokes on the strums.
 
 This song is a jazzed-up version of the old nursery rhyme “It’s Raining, 
It’s Pouring,” also known as the childhood taunt “Billy Is a Sissy” (or 
whichever personal childhood nemesis you plug in to the title). The 
major 7th chords you play in this song sound jazzy and give any song a 
modern sound.
 
 Oh, Susanna: To play “Oh, Susanna,” you need to know how to play 
Cmaj7, Dm7, Em7, Fmaj7, Am7, D7, Dm7, G7, and C chords and how to 
balance a banjo on your knee while traveling the Southern United States. 
Use all downstrokes on the strums.
 
 This arrangement of “Oh, Susanna” uses three types of 7th chords: 
dominant 7ths (D7 and G7), minor 7ths (Dm7, Em7, and Am7), and 
major 7ths (Cmaj7 and Fmaj7). Using minor 7ths and major 7ths gives 
the song a hip sound. Lest you think this attempt to “jazz up” a simple 
folk song comes from out of the blue, listen to James Taylor’s beauti-
ful rendition of “Oh, Susanna” on the 1970 album Sweet Baby James. He 
actually says “banjo” without sounding corny.

The Left Hand: Chord Techniques
In This Chapter
 Trying your hand at open-position chords
 Jump-starting with power chords
 Mastering barre chords
C
hords are built in the left hand and realized as sound by strums from 
the right hand. In Chapters 1 and 2 in Book II, you start to work with 
chords to enable your left hand to turn the strings into a meaningful arrange-
ment, so when you strum them it makes at least enough sense for you to 
check your tuning. But you don’t create music on the guitar by strumming 
something once and letting it sit there ringing indefinitely. Music has to 
move. The two ways to do that are to strum cool rhythms and to play 
awesome-sounding chords.
For now, don’t worry about what your right hand is supposed to do. You can 
execute the figures and rhythm charts in this chapter by playing one strum 
(that is, one downward stroke across the strings) per slash. Things get fan-
cier in Chapter 4 in Book II, but playing one strum per slash allows you to 
concentrate on your left-hand chord work.
Of course you don’t have to play the music here using only the one-stroke-per-
beat approach. If the spirit moves you — and the musical feel allows — try 
throwing in some in-between, up-and-down strums to get your music moving 
a bit. Just don’t let any right-hand fanciness get in the way of the business of 
switching chords.
Fingering or “grabbing” chords is the hardest thing beginning guitarists 
encounter — much harder than anything the right hand has to do. In this 
chapter, then, you tackle some chords and then focus on ways to get them 
memorized and under your fingers quickly. This chapter makes it easy on 
you, too, by including chord changes that require little more than sliding one 
chord form around on the neck. (Rock guitar styles are used to illustrate, but 
keep in mind that many of this chapter’s techniques are applicable to other 
styles besides rock.)

108
Book II: Sounds and Techniques 
Playing Open-Position Chords
Open-position chords, so named because they involve unfretted strings, are 
allowed to ring open, along with the fretted notes. Open-position chords have 
a “jangly,” pleasing quality and are sometimes called “cowboy chords” — 
probably because you can play simple, plaintive, spur-janglin’, chip-kickin’ 
songs with them.
Figure 3-1 is a chart of 24 chords that comprise just about all the useful open 
chords you use to play guitar. If you’ve never tried your hand (pun intended!) 
at open-position chords, refer to Chapters 1 and 2 in Book II for in-depth les-
sons on how to form and play these fundamental chords.

109
 Chapter 3: The Left Hand: Chord Techniques
Book II
Sounds and 
Techniques
 
An X over a string means it’s not played or sounded; an O indicates an open 
string that is sounded when strumming. (Chapter 2 in Book I introduces 
chord diagrams.) There’s more than one way to form some chords. Note that 
alternate fingerings appear below the primary ones.
Putting Power Chords into Play
Now it’s time to put the cowpokes out to pasture. Some guitar players, nota-
bly rock guitarists, tend to favor power chords. Power chords are even easier 
to finger than open-position chords, and they provide a simple means for 
moving beyond those first three frets. They represent rock guitar playing in 
all its raw and rugged glory, and after you understand how to use the 6th and 
5th strings to name them, placing them on the neck is as easy as A-B-C#.
A power chord is a two- or three-note chord that contains only the root and 
5th degree of the chord. A two-note power chord contains the root on the 
bottom and the 5th degree on top. A three-note power chord is built from the 
bottom up as root, 5th, root, so it has a root at the bottom, the 5th on top of 
that, and then the root again, one octave higher than the chord’s lowest note. 
(See Chapter 4 in Book I and Chapter 3 in Book VII for more about 5ths and 
other musical degrees and notes.) An A power chord, then, can be played 
either one of the two ways shown in Figure 3-2.
 
Figure 3-2: 
Two ways 
to play an 
A power 
chord.
 
 
Missing from power chords is the all-important 3rd degree. In the traditional 
sense, a chord is defined as three or more different notes, so a power “chord” 
is something of an exception. The 3rd of a chord is what determines whether 
the chord is major or minor. As you may have noticed from playing an open-
position A chord, the flat 3rd (one-and-a-half steps up from the root) makes 
the chord minor, and the major 3rd (two whole steps, or four half steps, up 
from the root) makes the chord major. In either chord, though, the root and 
the 5th don’t change. So take away the 3rd and you have a chord that is actu-
ally neither major nor minor: It can function as either without being “wrong.” 
This ambiguity is precisely what makes power chords so versatile.

110
Book II: Sounds and Techniques 
 
Power chords have another desirable quality, other than their stark construc-
tion and open sound: They sound great when played with distortion. This is 
because distortion imbues tones with harmonics, or different high-pitched 
notes in varying degrees of intensity, that make a sound much more harmoni-
cally rich than a nondistorted sound. Heavy distortion doesn’t sound as 
good on full major or minor chords, because the harmonics of those closely 
spaced intervals (the root, 3rd, and 5th) clash in the upper registers, making 
the sound brittle and strident. But with just the root and 5th, the upper har-
monics get close enough to dance together beautifully without stepping on 
each other’s toes. (Book III talks more about distortion and harmonics.)
Moving power chords
Unlike their open-position brethren, most power chords don’t incorporate 
open strings and are therefore moveable chords. Any chord that you can 
move from one position on the neck to another without rearranging your 
fingers is a moveable chord. Because they’re moveable, not to mention mini-
mal, you can switch from any power chord to another without twisting your 
fingers up like so much linguini. If you can count to 12 and recite the alphabet 
up to the letter G, you can find every power chord. Welcome to Easy Street.
 
Power chords take their name from the root note, as all chords do. In a G 
power chord, G is of course the root. Because power chords incorporate only 
the root and the 5th, they are often referred to as “5” chords. When you see a 
chord written “G5,” it’s a G power chord.
The power chord shown in Figure 3-3 has its root on the 6th string. Because 
the note on the 6th string at the 5th fret is A, it’s an A power chord (A5). Move 
the whole chord up a step (two frets) and it becomes B5. Likewise, move it 
down a step and it’s G5. Move it down one more step and it becomes — any 
guesses? — F5.

The 5th-string-based power chord looks almost exactly the same except it’s 
shifted over a set of strings. Figure 3-4 is a 5th-string-based power chord 
played at the 1st fret.

Like the 6th-string-based power chords, you can move around 5th-string-
based chords with ease. Move the B%5 up a whole step (two frets) to get C5, 
up another step to D5, and so on.
Pulling the power together
Position is the term used to describe where a chord is placed on the neck. 
A chord’s position is named for the fret where you plant your first finger. It 
doesn’t matter which string you’re on, just which fret. The 5th-string-based 
B%5 from the previous section is in first position. The first power chord you 
played — the 6th-string-based A5 at the 5th fret — is in 5th position.
Before you jump onstage with Aerosmith, try mixing up 6th- and 5th-string-
based power chords. Because power chords have so few notes and always 
assume the same shape, it’s a breeze to move them around the neck. Figure 
3-5 is a typical power-chord progression.

You don’t have to keep up with the performance you hear on the CD track 
when trying to finger and strum these chords. Just try switching the chords 
in time — that is, after every four beats.

112
Book II: Sounds and Techniques 
 
Much like you need the individual words to form the sentences that describe 
thoughts and ideas, so too must you have individual chords that can be later 
arranged into longer musical segments, called chord progressions. Chord pro-
gressions form the structure, or harmonic framework, for songs.

So now you’re slinging power chords all over the neck, and you’re thinking that 
all you need to be a rock god is a pair of leather pants and some friends who 
don’t smell so good. Well, pull your Lear jet back into the hangar for a minute. 
Although countless songs have been written using only the chord forms covered 
earlier in this chapter — open-position and power chords — your musical vocab-
ulary is about to expand a thousandfold. It’s time to saddle up to barre chords.
The term barre chord strikes fear into the hearts of beginning guitarists every-
where. Technically, a barre chord is just a chord where your left hand’s first 
(index) finger lies flat across the strings, forming a “bar,” with the rest of the 
chord made up by other fingers. Nevertheless, the term usually carries with 
it connotations of medieval torture practices.
Beginners have trouble with barre chords because they seem to require 
an inordinate amount of strength. Although strength is certainly involved, 
you don’t need quite so much of it after you become good at playing barre 
chords. Playing barre chords is like riding a bicycle: It’s really tough at first, 
but then it becomes second nature.
The Barre Chord Creed
Memorize the Barre Chord Creed for the most important aspects to learning 
and mastering barre chords. Here are the tips to keep in mind:
 
 Press firmly. You don’t need to embed the strings permanently into 
your flesh, but do apply strong, even pressure with your first finger. 
Rotate the finger slightly onto its side — the side away from the second 
finger.
 
 Thumb it. Keep your thumb placed directly in the center of the neck’s 
back. This is where the strength comes from. You’ll know you’re doing it 
right when the heel of your hand gets sore. Isn’t this the greatest?
 
 Keep your arms in. Try not to let your elbow stick out at your side like 
a chicken wing. Pull your elbow into your side if you can, and keep your 
left shoulder relaxed and down.

 Chapter 3: The Left Hand: Chord Techniques
Book II

Techniques
 
 Be fat-free. Make tiny adjustments so the fleshy parts of your fingers 
aren’t touching adjacent strings, causing them to buzz or muffle. Keep 
your knuckles rounded and try to press straight down on the strings, 
instead of from the side. Also make sure that a string isn’t running 
directly under the crease in the knuckle between your first and second 
finger joints.
 
Barre is the Spanish word for bar, and guitarists use this spelling because a 
lot of guitar notation uses Spanish terms (the same way other terms in music, 
such as piano for “soft,” fortissimo for “very loud,” and scuza plisa tu pasa di 
pasta for “the band is hungry” are in Italian), and because barre distinguishes 
itself from bar, the metal arm on the bridge of some guitars.
Playing E-based barre chords
Barre chords are formed as open-position-based chords with an added 
barre (your first finger) placed over the top. The first step is to finger an 
open-position E form (see Chapter 1 in Book II for a detailed explanation if 
you’re a bit rusty). But instead of using your first three fingers, fret the 
chord with your second, third, and fourth fingers. This leaves your first 
finger free to barre.
 
Right now, the nut — that slotted bar between the headstock and the fret-
board — is acting like a barre. You’re going to move the whole chord up and 
take over the nut’s job with your first finger.
 
1. Slide all the fretted notes up (away from the headstock) exactly one fret.
 
2. Lay your index finger down in the first fret, across all six strings, par-
allel to the nut.
 
3. Minding the Barre Chord Creed, apply pressure and strum away.
Congratulations. You’re now playing an F barre chord (see Figure 3-6). And, 
in a manner of speaking, you are now the nut.
 
Figure 3-6: 
The F barre 
chord.
 
F

Book II: Sounds and Techniques 
Unless you’re the type weakened only by kryptonite, you’ll have trouble get-
ting the F chord to sound good and feel comfortable. In the beginning, playing 
an F chord strains your hand, muffles the strings, and causes you to holler at 
various inanimate objects. This is normal.
 
Barre chords are harder to play in the first few frets, where the nut offers 
resistance, and they’re also harder way up the neck, where the action is 
higher and the frets are narrower. When you can form the F chord immedi-
ately, without agonizing through the steps shown above, try moving your F 
chord to the 5th fret (where, by the way, it becomes an A chord). It should be 
easier to press the strings down here than at the 1st fret.
Moving the E-form barre chord 
around the neck
All barre chords are moveable chords — that’s the beauty of ’em. Now that 
you’ve formed a barre chord (and can play it so the strings, when strummed, 
ring through clearly), you’re ready to move this sucker.
 
You’ve already had a glimpse of the thinking involved because you’ve moved 
power chords around the neck. (And some brave souls followed the advice in 
the last section to move the F chord up to the 5th fret.) Apply what you know 
about moving power chords to barre chords. The only difference is that 
you’re moving more notes per chord.
To identify which chords you’re playing on the neck as you move around, 
take the 6th-string shortcut. Because the lowest string of the guitar is called 
E, you can use the name of the notes on the 6th string to tell you where to 
play a given E-based form, just as you did with power chords. For example, 
the 5th fret of the E string is A, so the chord formed at the 5th fret using an E 
form is A. This shortcut enables guitarists to place chords on the fretboard 
by using the lowest note of the chord as the guide. (An “E-form” barre chord 
can also be called a 6th-string-based chord.)
Other E forms: Minor, dominant 7, 
minor 7, and 7sus
So far, you’ve built and moved only the E major barre shape. As you know 
from open-position chords, there are chordal varieties other than major. 
Chords that are given simple letter names (E, B%, D) are majors — all others 
are qualified (E minor, B% minor7, D7sus).

Here’s where your hard labor on that first barre pays off. Having successfully 
wrangled the E major barre-chord form, you can easily start adding other 
chord qualities. All of these forms can be played with small, easy changes to 
the E major barre. And all of them correspond directly with open-position E 
chords you already know. You are about to be so very happy.
To make things even easier for yourself, try these new forms at the 3rd fret, 
where it starts getting more reasonable to finger chords sans buzz and rattle.
 
Using the 6th-string shortcut described in the preceding section, you know 
that an E barre form played at the 3rd fret is a G chord. So if you play these 
forms in 3rd position, they’ll all be G chords of one type or another. But pay 
attention to the shapes, which you’ll move around, rather than the chords’ 
letter names.
To change a G major into a G minor, lift your second (middle) finger. Let the 
newly exposed note — 3rd string, 3rd fret — ring out with the rest of the 
barred notes. Yeah, that’s all there is to it! Figure 3-7 shows a 3rd-position G 
minor barre chord.

You’ve just learned four new chord forms — which, because they’re appli-
cable anywhere from 1st to 12th position, give you 48 new chords. Holy har-
mony. Go write a song already.
 
Create your own exercise by moving these forms all over the neck. Then 
switch between forms as you move them around: Play a major chord in 1st 
position, a minor in 3rd, and a dominant 7 in 8th. You may just stumble onto 
the next “Freebird.” We could use a new “Freebird.”

Playing A-based barre chords
Just as the family of E-based barres have open-position E forms (they are 
simply open-position shapes with a barre in front of them), A-based barres 
have open-position A forms. To form these chords, apply the same logic used 
to get from an open-position E major chord to a 1st position F major barre. 
No need to reinvent the wheel — save your creativity for your playing or 
your excuses for practicing at 2 a.m.
To create an A-based barre chord (see Figure 3-11), grab a plain ol’ open A 
major (check Chapter 1 in Book II if you need a refresher), but use fingers 2, 
3, and 4, instead of 1, 2, and 3, and then follow these steps:
 
1. Slide all the fretted notes up exactly one fret.
 
2. Lay your index finger down in the 1st fret, across the top five strings, 
parallel to the nut.
 
3. Minding the Barre Chord Creed, apply pressure and strum away.
 
Figure 3-11: 
A B% barre 
chord using 
the A-based 
form.
 
 
For A-based barre chords, the barre is shorter: Your first finger needs to span 
only the top five strings.
 
You don’t have to barre all six strings for the A-based barre because its root 
is on the 5th string: It’s a 5th-string-based form. If your index finger does lie 
across the 6th string (which can be hard to avoid), be careful not to strum 
the 6th string with your right hand. You may want to let your index finger lay 
limply on that bottom string, which will help mute the sound if you strum it 
accidentally. Be careful, because the results can be horrific when you start 
moving the A-based barre chord around the neck. An open low E string 
against a 6th-fret E% major chord? Ick.

118
Book II: Sounds and Techniques 
 
The hard part about this chord is pulling up the third-finger knuckle so the 
barred 1st string can sound. Because most guitarists find that to be too much 
trouble, they just end up playing the inner four strings (2 through 5) on the 
A major form. When they do this, they no longer have to make a barre out of 
the first finger — just the third finger — which makes this a pretty easy chord 
to play. Try Figure 3-12, compare it with your success on the previous finger-
ing, and choose which form works best for you.
 
Figure 3-12: 
The alterna-
tive way 
to finger 
an A-form 
barre chord.
 
Astute players who aren’t yet blinded by pain may have spotted something 
familiar in the bottom strings of the A and E barre forms: power chords. All 
three lower strings of the A major and E major barres contain the same notes 
as their power chord counterparts. Also, you may recall that power chords 
don’t carry a chord’s 3rd degree; in keeping, the bottom three strings of the 
A minor and E minor barre shapes are identical not only to their power chord 
counterparts but to their major brethren. Wow. Full circle, dude.
Moving the A-form barre chord
Because you can play a B% chord as a barre chord, you can now play all 12 
A-based major barre chords (the entire chromatic scale). All A-based chords 
are moveable and get their name from the 5th string (just as the open A 
chord does, and similar to how the E-chord form derives its name).
Figure 3-13 uses all A-based major barre chords. Say the names of the chords 
aloud as you play them at their corresponding frets. Listen to and play along 
with the CD to check your work. Don’t worry about matching the strumming 
pattern you hear on the CD; just strum along at your own pace and switch 
between chords after every bar.

Everything you already know about moving chords around the neck carries 
over to other barre-chord forms. Playing the minor, the 7th, or the minor 7
versions is no more physically demanding than playing the major barre 
forms; it’s just a matter of learning the fingering.
You can follow the numbered list in the section “Playing A-based barre 
chords” for creating the other versions of these A-based forms, or you can 
just try to form them after placing your first-finger barre over the appropriate 
fret and forming the chords from your remaining three fingers.
Figure 3-14 is a chart of five chord forms in A. The possible chord forms 
extend beyond these five, but these are key for playing most rock music.
You can find barre forms that directly correspond with open-position chords. 
For example, the 5th-string-based D minor played in 5th position has all the 
same notes (though some in different octaves) as the open-position D minor.
The number of chords you now can play up and down the neck is just plain 
incalculable. You are a veritable font of chord knowledge. Dip into the foun-
tain and enjoy this progression, which alternates between E- (6th-string) and 
A-based (5th-string) forms as the chords descend the neck. The changes in 
Figure 3-15 fit Bob Dylan’s “Lay Lady Lay.”

 Strumming with your right hand
 Switching up downstrokes and upstrokes
 Using your palm to mute and accent
T
he right hand marshals the chords and notes you form in the left hand 
into the sounds you actually hear. The right hand of a rhythm guitarist 
drives the rhythm section, weaving together the bass and drums and pro-
viding the underpinning for the singer, lead guitar, or other melodic instru-
ments. Whether it’s playing in a steady eighth-note groove, a funky 16 feel, 
or a hard-swinging shuffle, the rhythm guitar and the right-hand strumming 
that propels it forge the chords and riffs that you learn into a moving musical 
experience.
In this chapter you discover many different ways you can strum the guitar 
to make the rhythm fit different styles and feels. These variations help keep 
your music vital sounding and help you develop your skills as a rhythm gui-
tarist — one who provides the backing and the foundation to support the 
melody, and who can act as the glue between the other rhythm instruments, 
such as the bass and drums.
 
As in Chapter 3 in Book II, this chapter uses rock as a genre to illustrate 
guitar techniques. You can apply the skills in this chapter to other genres.
Strumming Along
Strumming is defined as dragging a pick (or your fingers) across the strings 
of the guitar. In Chapter 3 in Book II, you drag the pick in a downward motion 
(toward the floor) to sound the chords formed by the left hand, but you 
don’t try to do anything except that. In doing even that, however, you create 
rhythm.

122
Book II: Sounds and Techniques 
If you “pick-drag” in regular, even strokes, one per beat, adhering to a tempo 
(musical rate), you’re strumming the guitar in rhythm. And that’s music, whether 
you mean it to be or not. More specifically, you’re strumming a quarter-note 
rhythm, which is fine for songs such as the Beatles’ “Let It Be” and other ballads. 
For the record, strumming an E chord in quarter notes looks like the notation in 
Figure 4-1. Note that the figure uses rhythm slashes to show that you should play 
the entire chord, as opposed to note heads (which indicate only a single pitch).

E chord in

Track 15
 
The hardest part of learning rhythm guitar is realizing — and then maintain-
ing — all the repetition involved. It’s not what people expect when they pick 
up the guitar and want to learn a smorgasbord of cool licks and great riffs. 
But being able to play in time with unerring precision and rock-steady consis-
tency is an essential skill and a hallmark of solid musicianship. Most rhythm 
playing in rock involves a one- or two-bar pattern repeated over and over, 
varying only where there are accent points that the band plays in unison.
After you learn to play consistently, you can then deviate from the estab-
lished pattern you lay down and work on your own variations, as long as 
they’re tasteful, appropriate, and not too numerous. Like a rock ’n’ roll rebel 
once said, “You have to know the rules before you can break them.”
Downstrokes
A downstroke (indicated by the symbol U) is the motion of dragging the pick 
down, brushing across multiple strings on the guitar in the process. Because 
you execute a downstroke quickly (even on slow songs) the separate strings 
are sounded virtually simultaneously. If you play three or more notes this 
way, you produce a chord.
Strumming in eighth-note downstrokes
To get out of the somewhat plodding rhythm of a quarter-note-only strum-
ming pattern, you turn to eighth notes. As the math implies, an eighth note 
is one half the value of a quarter note, but in musical terms that equates to 
twice as fast, or more precisely, twice as frequently.

123
 Chapter 4: The Right Hand: Rhythm Techniques
Book II
Sounds and 
Techniques
So instead of playing one strum per beat, you now play two strums per beat. 
This means you must move your hand twice as fast, striking the strings two 
times per beat, instead of once per beat as you did to produce quarter notes. 
At moderate and slower tempos, you can do this easily. For faster tempos 
you use alternating upstrokes and downstrokes (explained later in this 
chapter). For playing the progression in Figure 4-1, however, simply using 
repeated downstrokes is easiest.
Figure 4-2 uses eighth notes for the first three beats of each bar and a quarter 
note for the last beat of each bar. The quarter note allows you a little more 
time to switch chords between the end of each bar and the beginning of the 
new bar. Isn’t that humane?
 
Figure 4-2: 
Eighth-note 
progression 
using down-
strokes.
 
Track 16
 
The term sim. in the music notation tells you to continue in a similar fashion. 
It’s typically used for articulation directions, such as down- and upstrokes.
Reading eighth-note notation
Notice that instead of the previously used slashes, you now resort to slashes 
with stems (the vertical lines coming down from the note head) and beams 
(the thicker horizontal lines that connect the stems). Quarter notes have 
single stems attached to them; eighth notes have stems with beams connect-
ing them to each other. An eighth note by itself, or separated by a rest, has a 
little flag instead of a beam.
 
Even though this newly introduced notation denotes specific rhythmic values 
(quarter notes, eighth notes), the note heads are still elongated and angled — 
not the same kind of smaller, rounded note heads used to indicate individual 
pitches. The symbols used in this chapter are still rhythm slashes that tell you 
how (in what rhythm) to play, but not exactly what (the individual pitches) to 
play. Your left-hand chord position determines the pitches.
Upstrokes
An upstroke (indicated by the symbol u) is just what it sounds like: the 
opposite of a downstroke. Instead of dragging your pick down toward the 
floor, you start from a position below the strings and drag your pick upward 
across the strings. Doing this comfortably may seem a little less natural than 

124
Book II: Sounds and Techniques 
playing a downstroke. One reason for this is that you’re going against gravity. 
Also, some beginners have a hard time holding on to their pick or preventing 
it from getting stuck in the strings. With practice, though, you can flow with 
the ups as easily as you can with the downs.
 
You use upstrokes for the upbeats (offbeats) in eighth-note playing, as the 
strokes in between the quarter-note beats.
When you start playing, don’t worry about hitting all the strings in an 
upstroke. For example, when playing an E chord with an upstroke, you 
needn’t strum the strings all the way through to the sixth string. Generally, 
in an upstroke, hitting just the top three or four strings is good enough. You 
may notice that your right hand naturally arcs away from the strings by that 
point, to an area above the center of the guitar. This is fine.
Upstrokes don’t get equal time with their downwardly mobile counterparts. 
You typically use upstrokes only in conjunction with downstrokes. Whereas 
you can use downstrokes by themselves just fine — for entire songs, even — 
very rarely do you use upstrokes in isolation or without surrounding them on 
either side with downstrokes. (Some situations do call for just upstrokes.)
So you should first tackle upstrokes in their most natural habitat: in an 
eighth-note rhythm figure where they provide the in-between notes, or off-
beats, to the on-the-beat downstrokes.
Combining downstrokes and upstrokes
The easiest way to perform an upstroke smoothly is in its reciprocal 
response to a downstroke. Play Figure 4-3 with a relaxed, free-swinging up-
and-down arm motion, working to get equal emphasis on each stroke, and 
being aware that your downstrokes will naturally include more (and lower) 
string-strikes than your upstrokes. The time signature is 4/4, which means 
the measures contain four beats, and each quarter note receives one beat.

Down-
strokes and 
upstrokes

Track 17

125
 Chapter 4: The Right Hand: Rhythm Techniques
Book II
Sounds and 
Techniques
At this easygoing tempo, you can probably play Figure 4-3 with all down-
strokes. If you try that, however, you discover that it introduces a tenser, 
more-frantic motion in your own strumming motion, which is not in character 
with the song’s mellow feel. Frantic motion can be a very good thing in rock, 
though. Figure 4-12 later in this chapter, for example, shows you how an all-
downstroke approach on a faster song is more appropriate than the easy 
back and forth of alternating downstrokes and upstrokes.
 
Whether an eighth-note pattern takes an all-downstroke or downstroke-
upstroke approach is determined more by the feel, rather than the speed. 
(Although it is physically easier to play eighth notes with alternating 
strokes.)
Playing a combination figure
Quarter notes and eighth notes make up much of medium-tempo-based 
music, so Figure 4-4 shows how a progression might use a mixture of quar-
ters and eighths to help convey different rhythmic intensity levels in a song.
 
Figure 4-4: 
Strumming 
in quarter 
notes and 
eighth

Track 18
 
Be aware that you not only have to control the strums in your down and up 
picking, but which strings you strike in each chord as well. Don’t forget that 
you play only the top four strings in a D chord and only the top five for C.
Strumming in 16ths
Sixteenth notes come twice as fast as eighth notes, or four to the beat. That 
can seem pretty twitchy, so 16th notes are almost always played with alter-
nating downstrokes and upstrokes. Some punk and metal bands play fast 
16th-note-based songs with all downstrokes, but their songs are usually 
about pain and masochism, so it’s understandable, given the circumstances. 
The acoustic guitar part in the Who’s “Pinball Wizard” is a classic example of 
16th-note strumming.
You start off with a progression played at a medium tempo, using a common 
16th-note figure. Figure 4-5 is based on an R&B progression and uses a 
repeated 16th-note scheme. True syncopation (rhythms employing dots and 
ties) stays out of the picture until later in the chapter.

If the rhythmic notation seems like it’s getting a little dense, don’t worry too 
much about understanding the notation thoroughly or being able to play it at 
sight. What’s important is to learn the figure, memorize it, and to play it cor-
rectly and with confidence. Listening to the CD repeatedly to learn this figure 
is okay, too. (Just don’t tell your fourth-grade piano teacher we told you it 
was okay to memorize the recorded sound and not to read the music.)
Reading 16th-note notation
Sixteenth notes are indicated with two beams connecting their stems (or if 
they’re by themselves, two flags).
Getting a shuffle feel
An important rhythm feel used extensively in rock is the shuffle. A shuffle 
is a lilting eighth-note sound where the beat is divided into two unbalanced 
halves, a long note followed by a short. Think of the riffs to such songs as 
Elvis Presley’s “Hound Dog,” the Beach Boys’ “California Girls,” Fleetwood 
Mac’s “Don’t Stop,” and the Grateful Dead’s “Truckin’.” These are all based on 
a shuffle feel.
 
The shuffle is formed from triplets, where the beat is first subdivided into 
three equal parts. Then the first two notes are held together.
Rather than thinking about it too much, this simple exercise can help you 
hear the difference between straight eighth notes (equally spaced) and triplet 
eighth notes (the first held twice as long as the second):
 
1. Tap your foot in a steady beat and say the following line, matching the 
bold syllables to your foot taps:
 
 Twink-le twink-le lit-tle star.
 
 That’s the sound of normal, equally spaced, straight eighth notes.
 
2. Now in the same tempo (that is, keeping your foot tap constant), try 
saying this line, based in triplets:
 
 Fol-low the yel-low brick road.

127
 Chapter 4: The Right Hand: Rhythm Techniques
Book II
Sounds and 
Techniques
 
 That’s the sound of triplets. In both cases you should keep your foot tap 
at exactly the same tempo and change only how you subdivide the beat 
internally.
 
3. Create shuffle eighth notes by sounding only the first and third notes 
of the triplet. You do this by sustaining the first note through the 
second or by leaving out that second note entirely.
 
 The new sound is a limping, uneven division that goes l-o-n-g-short, l-o-n-g-
short, l-o-n-g-short, and so forth.
 
 A good way to remember the sound of triplet eighth notes (the basis of 
a shuffle feel) is the song “When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again.” 
If you tap your foot or snap your fingers on the beat and then try saying 
the lyrics in rhythm, you get:
 
 When John-ny comes march-ing home a-gain, hur-rah
 
 The bold type represents the beat, where the syllables coincide with 
your foot tap or finger snap. The phrase “Johnny comes” is in triplets, 
because each syllable falls on one note of the three in between two 
beats. The rest of the phrase, “marching home again, hurrah,” divides 
each beat into two-syllable pairs, the first syllable longer than the 
second. This is the sound of eighth notes in a shuffle feel.
Figure 4-6 is a shuffle feel that uses downstrokes and upstrokes. To reward 
you for saying “twinkle, twinkle little star” out loud while you tapped your 
foot, you get three new bonus chords that are easy to play and will give your 
shuffle progression a real lift.

chords you already play. These new “chords” are easily executed by moving 
one and only one finger, while keeping the others anchored. It’s the first step

that makes you feel like a real guitar player. Have fun with this one!
The upstrokes still come at the in-between points — within the beats — but 
because of the unequal rhythm, it may take you a little time to adjust.
Dividing a band’s songs by straight eighths or 
shuffle feel
If you’ve never thought of songs by your favorite 
band as being in a straight-eighth feel or a shuf-

Sounds and 
Techniques
Mixing Single Notes and Strums
Rhythm guitar includes many more approaches than just simultaneously 
strumming the multiple strings of a chord. A piano player doesn’t plunk down 
all of her fingers at once every time she plays an accompaniment part, and 
guitarists shouldn’t have to strike all the strings every time they bring their 
pick down.
The pick-strum
Guitarists borrow a technique from their keyboard-plunking counterparts, 
who separate the left and right hands to play bass notes and chords, respec-
tively. When guitarists separate out the components of a chord, they don’t 
use separate hands, but combine both aspects in their right hand. Playing 
bass notes with chords is called a pick-strum pattern.
Separating the bass and treble so they play independently in time is a great 
way to provide rhythmic variety and introduce different chordal textures. 
Guitarists can even set up an interplay of the different parts — a bass and 
treble complementarity or counterpoint.
The boom-chick
The simplest accompaniment pattern is known by the way it sounds: boom-
chick. The boom-chick pattern is very efficient because you don’t have to 
play all the notes of the chord at once. Typically you play the bass note on 
the boom, and all the notes in the chord except the bass note on the 
chick — but you get sonic credit for playing twice.
Figure 4-7 shows a boom-chick, or bass-chord pattern in a bouncy country-
rock progression.

The symbol C immediately to the right of the treble clef in Figure 4-7 is a 
shorthand way to indicate 4/4 time. The examples in this book use 4/4 to 
indicate music in 4/4 time, but many examples of printed sheet music use C 
to indicate common, or 4/4, time.
The moving bass line
An important musical device available to you after you separate the bass 
from the chord is the moving bass line. Examples of songs with moving bass 
lines include Neil Young’s “Southern Man,” Led Zeppelin’s “Babe, I’m Gonna 
Leave You,” the Grateful Dead’s “Friend of the Devil,” and the Nitty Gritty Dirt 
Band’s “Mr. Bojangles.” A moving bass line can employ the boom-chick pat-
tern (see the preceding section).
Figure 4-8 shows a descending bass line, made even more effective by isolat-
ing the bass line from the chords. Although this is left-hand movement within 
a chord form, similar to the shuffle figure in Figure 4-6, you can think of this 
as new chord forms entirely, if that’s conceptually easier for you.
 
Figure 4-8:

bass line 
over a chord 
progression.
 
 
When a chord symbol features two letters separated by a forward slash, it 
indicates the chord and the bass note over which that chord sounds. For 
example, C/G is a C chord with a G in the bass. In this case, the bass note is a 
chord member (the notes of a C chord are C, E, and G), but it doesn’t always 
have to be that way. In the chord progression C-C/B-C/A, the bass notes B 
and A are not part of the chord but help to provide motion to another chord.
Disrupting Your Sound: 
Syncopated Strumming
After you develop a feel for strumming in different combinations of eighths, 
quarters, and 16ths, you can increase the rhythmic variation to these various 
groupings by applying syncopation. Syncopation is the disruption or altera-
tion of the expected sounding of notes. In rock ’n’ roll right-hand rhythm 

131
 Chapter 4: The Right Hand: Rhythm Techniques
Book II
Sounds and 
Techniques
playing, you do that by staggering your strum and mixing up your up- and 
downstrokes to strike different parts of the beats. By doing so, you let the 
vehicles of syncopation — dots and ties — steer your rhythmic strumming to 
a more driving and interesting course.
Syncopated notation: Dots and ties
A dot attached to a note increases its rhythmic value by half its original value. 
A dot attached to a half note (two beats) makes it three beats long. A dotted 
quarter note is one-and-a-half beats long, or a quarter note plus an eighth 
note.
A tie is a curved line that connects two notes of the same pitch. The value of 
the note is the combined values of the two notes together, and only the first 
note is sounded.
Figure 4-9 shows some common syncopation figures employing dots and ties. 
The top part of the table deals with dots and shows note values, their new 
value with a dot and the equivalent expressed in ties, and a typical figure 
using a dot with that note value. The bottom part of the table deals with ties 
and shows note values, their new value when tied to another note, and a typi-
cal figure using a tie with that note value.

Playing syncopated figures
So much for the music theory behind syncopation. Now how do you actually 
play syncopated figures? Try jumping in and playing two progressions, one 
using eighth notes and one using 16th notes, that employ common syncopa-
tion patterns found in rock.
Figure 4-10 shows a useful syncopation scheme for an easy 4/4 rhythm at a 
moderate tempo. Pay close attention to the downstroke (U) and upstroke 
(u) indications. Because the normal flow of down- and upstrokes is inter-
rupted in syncopation, it’s important to remember which stroke direction to 
play a note to avoid getting your strums out of synch.

Giving Your Left Hand a Break
If you listen closely to rhythm guitar in rock songs, you hear that strummed 
figures aren’t one wall of sound — that minuscule breaks occur in between 
the strums. These breaks prevent the chord strums from running into each 
other and creating sonic mush. The little gaps in sound keep a strumming 
figure sounding crisp and controlled.

133
 Chapter 4: The Right Hand: Rhythm Techniques
Book II
Sounds and 
Techniques
To form these breaks, or slight sonic pauses, you need to stop the strings 
from ringing momentarily. And we’re talking very small moments here. 
Controlling the right hand’s gas pedal with the left hand’s brake pedal is a 
useful technique for cutting off the ring-out of the strings so they don’t all run 
together.
Left-hand muting
To get the left-hand to mute the in-between sound between any two chords, 
just relax the fretting fingers enough to release pressure on the fretted 
strings. These strings will instantly deaden, or muffle, cutting off sound. 
What’s more, if you keep your right-hand going along in the same strumming 
pattern, you produce a satisfying thunk sound as the right hand hits all these 
deadened strings. This percussive element, intermixed among the ringing 
notes, creates an ideal rock rhythm sound: part percussive, part syncopated, 
and all the while driving. If you relax the left hand even further so it goes limp 
across all six strings, then no strings will sound, not just the ones the left-
hand fingers cover.
Also, allowing your left hand to do the muting means you can keep your right 
hand going, uninterrupted, in alternating down- and upstrokes. The notation 
indicates a left-hand mute with an X note head.
Implying syncopation
Figure 4-11 is technically a straight-ahead down-and-up eighth-note strum in 
the right hand. But because you employ left-hand muting, the sound seems 
to cut off in just the right places, creating an almost syncopated sound. Your 
right hand isn’t performing true syncopation, because it’s playing straight 
through. It’s just that some of the notes don’t come through audibly. More 
than creating a syncopated sound, however, left-hand muting provides the 
guitarist with another means for controlling the strings’ sound.
 
Figure 4-11: 
Left-hand

134
Book II: Sounds and Techniques 
 
Left-hand muting is one of those rhythm techniques that guitarists just seem 
to develop naturally, almost as if it weren’t a technique you had to learn 
because you’d invent it anyway, so obvious and useful is its benefit. And like 
riding a bicycle, left-hand muting is more difficult to execute slowly. So don’t 
analyze it too much as you’re learning; just strum and mute in the context of 
a medium-tempo groove. Your hands will magically synch up and you won’t 
even have to think about it.
Although left-hand muting belongs to the hand not named in this chapter, its 
impetus is drawn from the right-hand motion. Plus, performing a left-hand 
mute is impossible without another hand to turn it into sound.
Suppressing the Right Hand
You can also mute with your right hand (using the heel of the palm), but this 
produces a different effect than left-hand muting. In right-hand muting you 
still hear the sound of the fretted string, but in a muted and subdued way. 
You don’t use right-hand muting to stop the sound completely, as you do 
in a left-hand mute; you just want to suppress the string from ringing freely. 
Like left-hand muting, right-hand muting keeps your tone from experiencing 
runaway ring-out, but additionally it provides an almost murky, smoldering 
sound to the notes, which can be quite useful for dramatic effect. You some-
times hear this technique referred to as chugging.
You perform a right-hand mute by anchoring the heel of your right hand on 
the strings just above the bridge. Don’t place your hand too far forward or 
you’ll completely deaden the strings. Do it just enough so the strings are 
dampened (damping is a musical term which means to externally stop a 
string from ringing) slightly, but still ring through. Keep it there through the 
duration of the strum.
 
If a palm mute (as right-hand muting is known, abbreviated P.M.) de-emphasizes 
a string strike, then its evil twin, the accent, draws attention to a string strike. An 
accent is easy to execute: Just strike the string or strings harder than usual, and 
lift your right-hand palm from the strings as you do, to allow the strings to ring 
free. The result is that the accented strum stands out above the rest. An accent 
is indicated with a > just above or below the note head.
Palm mutes are much easier to perform if only one or two of the strings are 
struck, due to the restricted movement of the right hand caused by anchor-
ing it to the strings’ surface above the bridge. Figure 4-12 is a rhythm figure 
where you strike only the lowest note of the chord on the palm mutes, and 
the upper strings on the accents. Play this progression using all downstrokes 
to add intensity.

Left-Hand Movement within 
a Right-Hand Strum
In this chapter you deal mostly with right-hand movement using static left-
hand chord forms. When you begin to move the left hand in conjunction with 
the right, you uncover an exciting new dimension in rhythm guitar: left-hand 
movement simultaneous with right-hand rhythm. (It’s what you flirted with in 
Figure 4-6, but you’re now going to explore it fully.) This “liberating of the left 
hand” is also the first step in playing single-note riffs and leads on the guitar, 
which we get to in Chapter 3 in Book III.
Figure 4-13 features a classic left-hand figure that fits either a straight-eighth-
note groove or a shuffle feel (although it’s placed here in a straight-eighth set-
ting). The changing notes in this example are the 5th degrees of each chord, 
which move momentarily to the 6th degree. So in an A chord, the E moves to 
F#; in a D chord the A moves to B; and in an E chord the B moves to C#.
This pattern is known by various names, but we call it the “5-6 move.” 
(Clever, eh?) You can find it in songs by Chuck Berry, the Beatles, ZZ Top, 
and plenty of blues-rock tunes. The 5-6 move fits over any I-IV-V progression, 
but you see it here in the key of A.
Note that to more easily accommodate the 5-6 move, the figure supplies alter-
nate chords and fingering to satisfy the A, D, and E chords. In each case the 
chords use only three strings, all adjacent to each other.
And even though it’s in steady eighth notes, this progression should be 
played using all right-hand downstrokes. If you can throw in some palm 
muting (as is done on the CD), so much the better!

Giving Your Fingers Some Style
Fingerstyle, as the name implies, means you pluck the strings with the right-
hand fingertips. For these times you can put the pick down, stick it between 
your teeth, or tuck it in your palm — whichever allows you to grab it the fast-
est after the fingerstyle passage is over.
Fingerstyle is especially suited to playing arpeggios, or chords played one 
note at a time in a given pattern. Fingerstyle is a much more simplistic way to 
play different strings in rapid succession, as you must do for arpeggiated pas-
sages. Generally speaking, the thumb plays the bass strings and the fingers 
play the upper three strings. Think of the opening figure to Kansas’s “Dust 
in the Wind,” Fleetwood Mac’s “Landslide,” or Simon and Garfunkel’s “The 
Boxer,” and imagine trying to play those patterns with your pick hopping 
frantically around the strings.
Position your right hand just above the strings, so your fingers can dangle 
freely but in reach of the individual strings. In Figure 4-14, the thumb plays 
the downstem notes and the right-hand fingers play the upper notes. (For 
you classical guitar aficionados out there: The standard way to notate the

right-hand fingers is with the letters p, i, m, and a, for the Spanish words for 
the thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers.) In the example here, you don’t 
need to be that careful about which fingers play which strings, so the figure 
doesn’t indicate any left-hand fingerings. But a good way to approach Figure 
4-14 is to use the index finger to play the 3rd string, the middle finger to play 
the 2nd string, and the ring finger to play the 1st string. Work for an even 
attack in the fingers and a smooth flow between the thumb and the fingers.

Book II: Sounds and Techniques 
Of course, you don’t have to play an arpeggiated passage fingerstyle if it’s 
slow and there’s relatively little string skipping involved. But for longer pas-
sages, or if the tempo is fairly rapid and the string skipping is relentless, work 
out the passage as a fingerstyle exercise.
 
Many players use a combination of pick and fingers when fingerpicking, 
called hybrid picking. Substitute the pick for the thumb, the middle finger for 
the index, and the ring for the middle finger.

Playing Melodies in Position 
and in Double-Stops
In This Chapter
 Playing single notes in position
 Playing double-stops as string pairs
 Playing double-stops across the neck
 Playing songs in position and in double-stops
O
ne of the giveaways of beginning players is that they can play only 
down the neck, in open position, and that they play only single-string 
melodies. As you get to know the guitar better, you find you can use the 
whole neck to express your musical ideas, and that you’re not limited to 
plunking out just single notes.
In this chapter, you venture out of open-position base camp into the higher 
altitudes of position playing. You also pick up the technique of playing in 
double-stops along the way.
Playing in Position
As you listen to complicated-sounding guitar music played by virtuoso guitarists, 
you may imagine their left hands leaping around the fretboard with abandon. But 
usually, if you watch those guitarists on stage or TV, you discover that their 
left hands hardly move at all. Those guitarists are playing in movable position, 
or for short, playing in position.
 
Playing in position means your left hand remains in a fixed location on the neck, 
with each finger more or less on permanent assignment to a specific fret, and 
that you fret every note — except for open position, of course. If you’re playing
in 5th position, for example, your first finger plays the 5th fret, your second finger 

140
Book II: Sounds and Techniques 
plays the 6th fret, your third finger plays the 7th fret, and your fourth finger plays 
the 8th fret. A position, therefore, gets its name from the fret that your first 
finger plays.
In addition to enabling you to play notes where they feel and sound best on 
the fingerboard — not just where you can most easily grab available notes 
(such as the open-string notes in open position), playing in position makes 
you look cool — like a nonbeginner! Think of it this way: A layup and a slam-
dunk are both worth two points in basketball, but only in the latter case does 
the announcer scream, “And the crowd goes wild!”
Playing in position versus playing 
with open strings
Why play in position? Why not use open position and open strings all the 
time? Here are two key reasons:
 
 It’s easier to play high-note melodies. Playing in open position allows 
you to play only up to the 4th or 5th fret. If you want to play higher than 
that, position playing enables you to play the notes smoothly and 
economically.
 
 You can instantly transpose any pattern or phrase that you know in 
position to another key simply by moving your hand to another position. 
Because position playing involves no open strings, everything you play 
in position is movable.
 
People have the idea that playing guitar in lower positions is easier than 
playing in higher ones. The higher notes actually aren’t harder to play; they’re 
just harder to read in standard notation if you don’t get too far in a conven-
tional method book (where reading high notes is usually saved till last). But 
here, you’re not focusing on music reading but on guitar playing — so go for 
the high notes whenever you want.
Playing exercises in position
The major scale (you know, the familiar do-re-me-fa-sol-la-ti-do sound you get 
by playing the white keys on the piano starting from C) is a good place to 
start practicing the skills you need to play in position. Figure 5-1 shows a C 
major scale in 2nd position. Although you can play this scale in open position, 
play it as the tab staff in the figure indicates, because you want to start 
practicing your position playing.

141
 Chapter 5: Playing Melodies in Position and in Double-Stops
Book II
Sounds and 
Techniques
 
The most important thing about playing in position is the location of your left 
hand — in particular, the position and placement of the fingers. The following 
list contains tips for positioning your left hand and fingers:
 
 Keep your fingers over the appropriate frets the entire time you’re 
playing. Because you’re in 2nd position for this scale, keep your first 
finger over the 2nd fret, your second finger over the 3rd fret, your 
third finger over the 4th fret, and your fourth finger over the 5th fret 
at all times — even if they’re not fretting any notes at the moment.
 
 Keep all of your fingers close to the fretboard, ready to play. At first, 
your fingers may exhibit a tendency to straighten out and rise away from 
the fretboard. This tendency is natural, so work to keep them curled and 
to hold them down over the frets where they belong for the position.
 
 Relax! Although you may think that you need to intensely focus all of 
your energy on performing this maneuver correctly or positioning that 
finger just so, you don’t. What you’re actually working toward is simply 
adopting the most natural and relaxed approach to playing the guitar. 
(You may not think it all that natural right now, but eventually, you’ll 
catch the drift.) So take things easy, but remain aware of your movements. 
Is your left shoulder, for example, riding up like Quasimodo’s? Check it 
periodically to make sure it stays tension free. Remember to take frequent 
deep breaths, especially if you feel yourself tightening up. And practice in 
front of a mirror from time to time.

Look at Figure 5-1 and notice that the score indicates left-hand fingerings under 
the tab numbers. These indicators aren’t essential because the position itself 
dictates these fingerings. But if you want, you can read the finger numbers 
(instead of the tab numbers) and play the C scale that way (keeping an eye 
on the tab staff to check which string you’re on). Then, if you memorize the 
fingerings, you have a movable pattern that enables you to play a major scale 
in any key.

142
Book II: Sounds and Techniques 
Play the one-octave scale (one having a range of only eight notes) shown in 
Figure 5-1 by using both down- and upstrokes — that is, by using alternate 
(down and up) picking. Try it descending as well (you should practice all 
scales ascending and descending). This scale isn’t on the CD; you already 
know how it sounds — it’s the familiar do re mi fa sol la ti do.
Figure 5-2 shows a two-octave C major scale (one with a range of 15 notes) in 
the 7th position. Notice that this scale requires you to play on all six strings.

To help you remember to hold your fingers over the appropriate frets all the 
time, even if they’re not playing at the moment, and keep your fingers close 
to the fretboard, remember this twist on an old expression: Keep your friends 
close, your enemies closer, and your frets even closer than that.
Practice playing the scale shown in Figure 5-2 up and down the neck, using 
alternate picking. If you memorize the fingering pattern (shown under the 
tab numbers), you can play any major scale simply by moving your hand up 
or down to a different position. Try it. And then challenge the nearest piano 
player to a transposing (key-changing) contest using the major scale.
 
Play scales slowly at first to ensure clean and smooth notes; then gradually 
increase your speed. Start with a metronome at 60 beats per minute.
Shifting positions
Music isn’t so simple that you can play it all in one position, and life would 
be pretty static if you could. In real-world situations, you must often play an 
uninterrupted passage that takes you through different positions. To do so 
successfully, you need to master the position shift like an old politician.
Andrés Segovia, legend of the classical guitar, devised fingerings for all 12 
major and minor scales. Figure 5-3 shows how Segovia played the two-octave 
C major scale. It differs from the two scales in the preceding section in that it 
requires a position shift in the middle of the scale.

Play the first seven notes in 2nd position and then shift up to 5th position by 
smoothly gliding your first finger up to the 5th fret (3rd string). As you play 
the scale downward, play the first eight notes in 5th position, and then shift 
to 2nd position by smoothly gliding your third finger down to the 4th fret 
(3rd string). The important thing is that the position shift sound seamless.
Someone listening shouldn’t be able to tell that you shift positions. The trick 
is in the smooth gliding of the first (while ascending) or third (while descend-
ing) finger. Practice this smooth glide to make it sound uninterrupted and 
seamless. Isolate just the two notes involved (3rd string, 4th fret, and 3rd 
string, 5th fret) and play them over and over as shown in the scale until you 
can make them sound as if you’re making no position shift at all.
Building strength and dexterity 
by playing in position
 
Some people do all sorts of exercises to develop their position playing. They 
buy books that contain nothing but position-playing exercises. Some of these 
books aim to develop sight-reading skills, and others aim for left-hand finger 
strength and dexterity. But you don’t really need such books. You can make up 
your own exercises to build finger strength and dexterity. (And sight-reading 
doesn’t concern you now anyway because you’re reading tab numbers.)
To create your own exercises, just take the two-octave major scale shown 
back in Figure 5-2 and number the 15 notes of the scale as 1 through 15. Then 
make up a few simple mathematical combinations that you can practice playing. 
Following are some examples:
 
 1-2-3-1, 2-3-4-2, 3-4-5-3, 4-5-6-4, and so on. (See Figure 5-4a.)
 
 1-3-2-4, 3-5-4-6, 5-7-6-8, 7-9-8-10, and so on. (See Figure 5-4b.)
 
 15-14-13, 14-13-12, 13-12-11, 12-11-10, and so on. (See Figure 5-4c.)

144
Book II: Sounds and Techniques 
Figure 5-4 shows how these numbers look in music and tab. Remember, these 
notes are just suggested patterns to memorize and help build dexterity.
You get the idea. You can make up literally hundreds of permutations and 
practice them endlessly — or until you get bored. Piano students have a 
book called Hanon that contains lots of scale permutations to help develop 
strength and independence of the fingers. You can check out that book for 
permutation ideas, but making up your own is probably just as easy.

 Chapter 5: Playing Melodies in Position and in Double-Stops
Book II
Sounds and 
Techniques
Double-Stops
 
Double-stop is guitar lingo for playing two notes at once — something the 
guitar can do with relative ease but that’s impossible on woodwinds and only 
marginally successful on bowed string instruments. (Actually guitarists lifted 
the term from violin playing but quickly made double-stops truly their own.) 
By the way, you do nothing special in fretting the notes of a double-stop. Fret 
them the same way you do chords or single notes.
You experience the guitar’s capability to play more than one note simultane-
ously as you strum a chord, but you can also play more than one note in a 
melodic context. Playing double-stops is a great way to play in harmony with 
yourself. So adept is the guitar at playing double-stops, in fact, that some 
musical forms — such as ’50s rock ’n’ roll, country, and Mariachi music (you 
know, the music that Mexican street bands play) — use double-stops as a 
hallmark of their styles.
Understanding double-stops
A double-stop is nothing more than two notes that you play at the same time. 
It falls somewhere between a single note (one note) and a chord (three or more 
notes). You can play a double-stop on adjacent strings or on nonadjacent 
strings (by skipping strings). The examples and songs that you find in this 
chapter, however, involve only adjacent-string double-stops because they’re 
the easiest to play.
If you play a melody in double-stops, it sounds sweeter and richer, fuller and 
prettier than if you play it by using only single notes. And if you play a riff in 
double-stops, it sounds gutsier and fuller — the double-stops just create a 
bigger sound. Check out some Chuck Berry riffs — “Johnny B. Goode,” for 
example — and you can hear that he uses double-stops all the time.
Playing exercises in double-stops
There are two general ways to play double-stops: You can play passages using 
only one pair of strings (the first two, for example) — moving the double-stops 
up and down the neck — or using different string pairs and moving the double-
stops across the neck (first playing the 5th and 4th strings, for example, and 
then the 4th and 3rd, and so on).

146
Book II: Sounds and Techniques 
Playing double-stops up and down the neck
Start with a C major scale that you play in double-stop thirds (notes that are 
two letter names apart, such as C-E, D-F, and so on), exclusively on the first 
two strings, moving up the neck. This type of double-stop pattern appears in 
Figure 5-5. The left-hand fingering doesn’t appear below the tab numbers in 
this score, but that’s not difficult to figure out. Start with your first finger for 
the first double-stop. (You need only one finger to fret this first double-stop 
because the 1st string remains open.) Then, for all the other double-stops in 
the scale, use fingers 1 and 3 if the notes are two frets apart (the second and 
third double-stops, for example) and use fingers 1 and 2 if the notes are one 
fret apart (the fourth and fifth double-stops, for example). With your right 
hand, strike only the 1st and 2nd strings.

Playing double-stops across the neck
Playing double-stops across the neck is probably more common than playing 
up and down the neck on a string pair. Figure 5-6 shows a C major scale that 
you play in thirds in open position, moving across the neck.

 Chapter 5: Playing Melodies in Position and in Double-Stops
Book II
Sounds and 
Techniques
What’s especially common in rock and blues songs is playing double-stops 
across the neck where the two notes that make up the double-stop are on the 
same fret (which you play as a two-string barre). Check out Books III and IV 
for more information on rock and blues.
Again, the example in Figure 5-6 doesn’t show the fingerings for each double-
stop. But you can use fingers 1 and 2 if the notes are one fret apart and fin-
gers 1 and 3 if the notes are two frets apart.
 
Double-stops occur in the opening of Jimmy Buffett’s “Margaritaville,” Leo 
Kottke’s version of the Allman Brothers’ “Little Martha,” Van Morrison’s 
“Brown-Eyed Girl,” Chuck Berry’s “Johnny B. Goode,” and the intros to Simon 
and Garfunkel’s “Homeward Bound” and “Bookends.”
Playing Songs in Position 
and in Double-Stops
Certain keys fall comfortably into certain positions on the guitar. Songs are 
based in keys, so if you play a song in a particular key, the song will also fall 
comfortably into a certain position. Rock, jazz, blues, and country lead play-
ing all demand certain positions to render an authentic sound.
Telling you that the melody of a song sounds best if you play it in one posi-
tion rather than another may seem a bit arbitrary to you. But trust us on this 
one — playing a Chuck Berry lick in A is almost impossible in anything but 
5th position. Country licks that you play in A, on the other hand, fall most 
comfortably in 2nd position, and trying to play them anywhere else is just 
making things hard on yourself.
 
The best position for a certain style not only sounds best to your ears, but 
also feels best to your hands. And that’s what makes playing the guitar so 
much fun.
Play the two songs in this section by reading the tab numbers and listening 
to the CD; notice how cool playing up the neck feels instead of playing way 
down in open position, where those beginners play.
When you’re playing in position, remember to keep your left hand in a fixed 
position, perpendicular to the neck, with your first finger at a given fret and the 
other fingers following in order, one per fret. Hold the fingers over the appro-
priate frets, close to the fretboard, even when they’re not fretting notes.

148
Book II: Sounds and Techniques 
Here is some useful information to help you play the songs:
 
 Turkey in the Straw: To play this song, you need to know how to play in 
7th position (see the section “Playing in Position,” earlier in this chapter) 
and what saying “day-day to the wagon tongue” means.
 
 Aura Lee: To play this song, you need to know how to play double-stops 
up and down the neck on the 1st and 2nd strings (see the aptly entitled 
section “Playing double-stops up and down the neck,” earlier in this 
chapter) and how to gyrate your pelvis while raising one side of your 
upper lip.
 
 You play this arrangement of “Aura Lee” — a song made famous by 
Elvis Presley as “Love Me Tender” — exclusively on the first two strings, 
moving up and down the neck. In the double-stop scales that you prac-
tice in Figures 5-5 and 5-6, the two notes of the double-stop move up or 
down together. In “Aura Lee” the two notes of the double-stop some-
times move in the same direction and sometimes in opposite directions. 
Other times, one of the notes moves up or down while the other remains 
stationary. Mixing directions makes an arrangement more interesting. 
Play and listen to “Aura Lee” to hear this for yourself.
 
 Notice that the left-hand fingerings appear under the tab numbers. If the 
same finger plays successive notes, but at different frets, a slanted line 
indicates the position shift (as in measures 5, 7, and 9). For your right-
hand picking, use all downstrokes. Remember to repeat the first four bars 
(as the repeat signs around them indicate) before continuing to bar 5. And 
make the song tender, just as Elvis did. Uh-thank yew verrah much.

R
ock guitar does not have a dignified history in music. It doesn’t come 
from a long lineage of historical development where composers such as 
Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms wrote lovingly for it, composing concertos and 
sonatas highlighting its piquant and gentle qualities. It wasn’t played in the 
great European concert halls or in the parlors of fine households.
Not only was rock guitar unknown to the great composers of the ages, but 
they couldn’t have even conceived of such a thing in their worst nightmares. 
Imagine what they would have thought of an Ozzy Osbourne concert — a 
nightmare no matter which century you hail from! Indeed, even if they could 
have heard, through some sort of time travel, an electric guitar banging out 
the riff to “Satisfaction,” they would have hardly recognized it as music.
Rock guitar is a mid-late-20th-century invention. It has no memory of a 
bygone era when youths were respectful of elders, music was a polite pur-
suit, and musicians cared about social acceptance. Rock guitar is for people 
who like their music loud, in your face, electric, and rebellious, and who owe 
no debt to history. Rock guitar is probably not the wisest choice of instru-
ments to tackle if you want to garner acceptance from the music community.
So if you want respect, take up the flute. If you want to set the world on fire, 
attract adoring fans, and get back at your parents to boot — pick up an elec-
tric guitar and wail, baby, wail, because rock guitar will change your life.
First, though, you gotta learn how to play the thing.

154
Part III: Rock Guitar 
Differentiating Between Rock and 
Acoustic Guitar: It Ain’t Just Volume
When you see someone wailing away on rock guitar — on TV, in a film, or at 
a live concert — be aware that what you’re seeing is only part of the story. 
Sure, someone playing rock guitar is holding an instrument with six strings, 
a neck, and a body — qualities that describe the instrument that classical 
guitarist Andrés Segovia played — but the sound couldn’t be more differ-
ent. That difference in sound is the key to understanding rock guitar. What’s 
important is not the leather, the hair, the onstage theatrics, the posturing, 
the smoke bombs, or the bloody tongues — but the sound of that guitar.
It was the sound of the electric guitar — so different from that of its prede-
cessor, the acoustic guitar — placed in the hands of some early, forward-
looking visionaries that forced a cultural change, a musical modification, and 
a historical adjustment to the way we experience popular music. Songwriters 
had to write differently, recording engineers had to record differently, and 
listeners had to do a major attitude adjustment to get their ears around it. 
Heck, people even had to learn new dances.
But what makes the sound of an electric guitar so different from an acoustic 
one? If you didn’t think about it, you might say, well, volume. Rock guitar is 
just a whole lot louder than its acoustic counterpart. Although that may be 
true most of the time, volume alone is not what makes rock guitar unique. 
True, you listen to rock at high volumes — its message tastes better served 
up loud — but volume is a byproduct, an after-effect, not what makes rock 
different or what drives it.
To really understand rock guitar, you need to explore some of its qualities 
other than volume. Don’t worry, though; this chapter gets back to volume 
eventually.
Sound quality, or timbre
When guitarists “electrified” their acoustic guitars, they originally intended 
to give the guitar a fighting chance in the volume department. Unsatisfied 
with the results of placing a microphone in front of the guitar, they sent the 
guitar’s sound to a speaker by placing a magnetic element called a pickup 
under the guitar’s strings. (See “Signal” and “Distortion and sustain” later in 
this chapter for more on pickups.) Players quickly found, though, that, unlike 
a microphone, a pickup didn’t just make the sound louder, it changed the 
tone too. How? It wasn’t that obvious, but it was tangible.

155
 Chapter 1: It’s Only Rock Guitar, but I Like It
Book III
Rock 
Guitar
 
The basic differences between a guitar coming out of a pickup and a guitar 
playing into a mike or mic (slang for microphone) are that the sound coming 
out of a pickup
 
 Is smoother and less woody.
 
 Is more electronic, with purer-sounding tones, like that of an organ.
 
 Has a less defined lifecycle, or envelope — a beginning, middle, and end. 
These stages, so clear in the sound of a plucked acoustic guitar string, 
are blurred together in an electric guitar.
Signal
When progressive-minded guitarists of the ’30s and ’40s first put electro-
magnetic elements under their strings to “pick up” their vibrations and send 
them along a wire to an amplifier, they did a lot more than increase the 
volume — though they didn’t know it at the time. They were on their way to 
creating one of those “happy accidents” so common in art and science (and 
this was a little of both, really).
Originally, jazz guitarists playing in the big bands of the day were merely 
seeking a way to cut through all the din of those blaring horns and thunder-
ing drums. The mellow guitar, regarded by most other musicians as a mere 
parlor instrument with dubious stage presence, was no match for the louder 
brass and percussion instruments. The banjo had a sharp, cutting quality, 
and was better at projecting on the bandstand, but its tone was falling out of 
fashion in favor of the more full-bodied, versatile tone of the guitar. Problem 
was, the guitar just wasn’t that loud, so something had to be done.
Slapping on heavier-gauge (thicker) steel strings helped, but it still wasn’t 
enough. Placing a mike in front of the guitar, as was done for vocalists, 
worked somewhat, but was cumbersome, and the mike picked up the sur-
rounding sound as well as the guitar. Plus, who wanted to bother miking the 
lowly guitarist way over in the rhythm section when you had some hotshot 
crooner in the spotlight at center stage?
To avoid these problems, luthiers (guitar makers) got the idea to put a mag-
netic element just underneath the strings to carry the signal electronically 
to an amplifier. Because the strings were metal — specifically, electrically 
conductive magnetic metal — the sound of the strings traveled electronically 
through the pickup (so called because it picked up the sound of the vibrating 
string), down the attached wire, into a portable amplifier, and then out of a 
speaker.

156
Part III: Rock Guitar 
The electric guitar was born, but getting from electrification to rock ’n’ roll 
nirvana was still a bit of a journey. It would be some time before guitarists 
recognized the monster they had spawned from the unholy union of electric-
ity and acoustic guitar. (Get used to imagery involving evil, wickedness, and 
other bad stuff; it’s all part of rock ’n’ roll lore.)
Distortion and sustain
When the six-string Dr. Frankensteins of the ’30s and ’40s were electrifying 
their guitars, they weren’t envisioning what Jimi Hendrix would do decades 
later at Woodstock and Monterey. Just like the well-meaning doctor in Mary 
Shelley’s novel, early electronic guitar designers were wholesome and good. 
These pioneer inventors wanted to reproduce the sound of the acoustic 
guitar as faithfully as possible. Fortunately for us, they failed miserably. But 
electronics’ loss was music’s gain, because even though the electric guitar 
sound was nothing like the acoustic sound — or the acoustic guitar sound as 
heard through a microphone — it nonetheless had a very pleasing and musi-
cally useful quality.
The effort to produce an exact, amplified match of the original acoustic guitar 
failed primarily because it introduced distortion (an untrue representation 
of the sound) into the sound. The louder the sound, or the more the guitar 
“worked” the electronic circuitry, the more distorted the sound got. As the 
electronic signal “heated up,” the sound became fuzzier (where the high fre-
quencies became more muted), and the tone generally warmed up (sounding 
more rounded and less brittle). All of this distortion increased the sustain 
(the tendency for the tone to ring indefinitely at the same level), which was 
noticeable in even the lowest of volumes.
Distortion, normally a bad thing in just about any other electronic endeavor, 
had a nice effect for guitar tone. As the guitar became thought of more and 
more as a lead instrument, guitarists found they could work the distortion 
factor to their advantage. An electric guitar had a different, better tonal qual-
ity, called timbre.
This timbre (a musical term for tone, or sound quality), distortion, and 
increased sustain took the plunkiness out of the guitar’s tone and made it 
more smoothly melodic — more like the buzzy, reedy qualities of, say, a 
saxophone or a blues vocalist, which is why so many early rock guitarists 
cut their musical teeth on the blues. Whereas the guitar had formerly been a 
rhythm instrument, owing to its clipped sound, rapid decay (the quality of a 
sound to die away), and strident tone, the “electronic” guitar now had prop-
erties more suited to melody-making. The guitar was poised to step out of the 
background and up to the spotlight itself. All it needed was some brave souls 
to tame this new sonic monster.

157
 Chapter 1: It’s Only Rock Guitar, but I Like It
Book III
Rock 
Guitar
 
Plenty of acoustic guitarists at that time were playing melody, notably Django 
Reinhardt. Reinhardt even bent strings — something that would become the 
province of electric guitarists everywhere, but is generally shunned by classi-
cal guitarists who deem the technique “unacousticlike.”
Oh yes, and volume
Of course, electrifying a guitar did accomplish what it set out to do — make 
the guitar louder. Although it needed an electronic crutch, in the form of 
amplification through an external apparatus, this system of pickups, wires, 
and a portable amplifier (where the guitarist didn’t need to rely on the audi-
torium’s sound engineer) gave guitarists the freedom to play in all sorts of 
styles — melodic, rhythmic, and chordal — and freed them from the “rhythm 
section ghetto.”
An excellent example of an early electric guitarist who realized and exploited 
the newfound qualities of the electric guitar was jazz guitarist Charlie 
Christian. It’s important to note that even though Christian was not a rock 
player (rock just didn’t exist in the ’30s), he is worshipped by electric guitar-
ists everywhere — from blues to jazz to rock — as an incredible visionary 
who realized the power of the electric guitar’s tone.
Some people may claim that Christian was, in part, responsible for inventing 
the electric guitar pickup, but this is just a myth. However, he certainly did 
his part to popularize the “pickup-configured” electronic guitar, and he is 
one of its best early practitioners, because he recognized — and exploited 
through his musical genius — its sustain qualities.
After the guitar could play as loud as the other, more charismatic instru-
ments (such as the trumpet and saxophone), it wasn’t long before the guitar 
would become a featured instrument, both from a personality perspective as 
well as an instrument for solo exhibitionism.
Listening examples
 
You can talk all you want about the tone of the electric guitar, but the best 
way to understand its tonal qualities is to listen to some classic examples.
 
 Led Zeppelin’s “Stairway to Heaven” is not only a classic song, it’s one 
of the best illustrations of the differences between electric and acoustic 
guitar. The song begins with a plaintive vocal by Robert Plant, accom-
panied by a Renaissance-sounding acoustic guitar. The accompaniment 
gradually builds, and then at 6:42 guitarist Jimmy Page launches into 

158
Part III: Rock Guitar 
the solo section with an opening phrase (a musically complete passage 
or thought of any given length) that sums up the essence of the electric 
guitar in just two measures. Listen to the first note, which seems to hang 
in midair and sing. The rest of the solo is a tour de force of technique, 
phrasing, and tone, but it’s that opening riff (a self-contained musical 
phrase) that grabs you.
 
 Another well-known example is the guitar solo section of the Eagles’ 
“Hotel California,” played by Joe Walsh and Don Felder. This solo is 
given plenty of room to breathe by the accompaniment. The gliding 
quality at the end of Walsh’s first short phrase (the fifth note in the 
opening sequence) is a string bend, where you stretch the string by 
pushing it out of its normal alignment causing the pitch to rise. Listen to 
how the note, again, sings. This quality, broken down to its component 
attributes, has a smooth sound (timbre); a reedy, fuzzy quality (distor-
tion) that doesn’t resemble the plucked sound of the acoustic guitar; 
and an elongated, non-decaying volume and intensity (sustain).
These examples are both in the melodic vein. Things really get weird when 
guitarists started abandoning melody altogether and choose to exploit 
timbre, distortion, and sustain for their own purposes. Jimi Hendrix, for 
example, took distortion and sustain to the nth degree.
Guitar, Amp, and Effects: The Power Trio
All right, the previous section helps you to understand the tonal differences 
of an electric guitar versus an acoustic one, and that an electric guitar has 
pickups (or magnetic elements) that carry the sound via an attached wire to 
a loudspeaker. What else do you need?
A burning question for most aspiring rock guitarists is, “Since I have an elec-
tric guitar here, does that mean I also have to have an amp?”
 
Yes, you do need an amplifier. Just as you can’t hear a scream without ears, 
so, too, can you not hear a guitar without its amplifier and speaker (in guitar 
terms, an “amplifier” can refer to the amplifier circuitry and the speaker, 
which are often housed in the same box). Electric guitars can have the big-
gest, most-powerful, nuclear-charged pickups on board, but without an amp, 
the guitar will make no noise.
Sounds unbelievable, but it’s true. No amp, no electric guitar sound. Anytime 
you see somebody walking around with an electric guitar, you can bet he 
or she is looking for an amp. Therefore, you must have at least two ele-
ments to even be audible on the electric guitar: the guitar itself and the amp. 
(Technically speaking, you also need a cord, or wire, to attach the electric 
guitar to the amp.)

Realistically, however, guitarists these days routinely introduce a third ele-
ment into the signal chain (as the path from the originating guitar pickups 
to the terminating amp speaker is known): intermediary electronic gizmos 
known as effects. These typically sit between a guitar and an amp, and con-
nect to each other with short cords, via in and out jacks (the electronic term 
for sockets, or something you can insert plugs into).
The electric guitar
The electric guitar is the principal player in the three-part system that com-
prises the rock guitar sound. And whether it has a natural mahogany finish 
or is painted Day-Glo green with purple lightning bolts across the body, all 
electric guitars have common properties. Like an acoustic guitar, an electric 
has a neck and a body, six strings, and tuning keys on the top of the neck that 
allow you to tighten or loosen the strings to the desired pitch — the process 
known as tuning. (See Chapter 1 in Book I for details.) Unlike the acoustic 
guitar, however, an electric guitar sports pickups (electromagnetic devices 
that “sense” the strings’ vibrations and create a small current), knobs, and 
switches for controlling the pickups, and possibly other hardware (such as a 
bar, described in the following bulleted list) that acoustic guitars don’t have. 
Figure 1-1 shows the various parts of the electric guitar.
 
Here’s a quick overview of the functions of the various parts of the electric 
guitar (refer to Chapter 1 in Book I for a fuller run-down).
 
 Bar: A metal rod or arm attached to the bridge that varies the string ten-
sion by tilting the bridge back and forth. It’s also called the tremolo bar, 
whammy bar, vibrato bar, and wang bar.
 
 Body: The large, shapely wooden mass that provides an anchor for 
the neck and bridge. The body can either be solid, hollow, or partially 
hollow, and houses the bridge assembly and electronics (pickups as well 
as tone and volume controls).
 
 Bridge: The metal assembly that anchors the strings to the body.
 
 End pin: A metal post screwed into the body, where the rear end of the 
strap connects. The other end of the strap connects to the strap pin.
 
 Fretboard: A flat, plank-like piece of wood that sits atop the neck and 
has frets embedded in it. This is where you place your left-hand fingers 
to produce notes and chords. It is also known as the fingerboard.
 
 Frets: Thin metal bars embedded perpendicular to the strings that 
shorten the effective vibrating length of a string, enabling it to produce 
different pitches.
 
 Headstock: The section that holds the tuning machines and provides a 
place for the manufacturer to display its logo.

 Neck: The long, club-like wooden piece that connects the headstock to 
the body. Some guitarists like to wield their guitars like clubs, and usu-
ally do so by holding them by the neck.
 
 Nut: A slotted sliver of stiff nylon or other synthetic substance that 
stops the strings from vibrating beyond the neck. The strings pass 
through the slots on their way to the tuners in the headstock. The nut is 
one of the two points at which the vibrating area of the string ends. (The 
bridge is the other.)
 
 Output jack: The insertion point, or jack, for the cord that connects the 
guitar to the amplifier or other electronic device. You will sometimes 
hear this jack called an input because guitarists think of putting a cord 
“into” the jack. Electronically speaking, however, this is an output jack 
because it carries signal out of the guitar.
 
 Pickup selector: A switch that determines which pickup or pickups are 
currently active.
 
 Pickups: Bar-like magnets that create the electrical current that the 
amplifier converts into musical sound.
 
 Strap pin: The metal post where the front, or top, end of the strap con-
nects. The strap pin is screwed into either the guitar’s back (as on a 
Gibson Les Paul) or into the end of one of the “horns” (as on a Fender 
Stratocaster). The other end of the strap connects to a corresponding 
pin, the end pin.
 
 Strings: The six metal wires that, drawn taut, produce the notes of the 
guitar. Although not strictly part of the actual guitar (you attach and 
remove them at will), strings are an integral part of the whole system, 
and a guitar’s entire design and structure revolves around making the 
strings ring out with passion and musicality (and don’t forget volume!).
 
 Top: The face of the guitar’s body. The top is often a cosmetic or decora-
tive cap that overlays the rest of the body material.
 
 Trussrod: An adjustable steel rod that can be rotated using a special 
wrench and which helps keep the neck straight. You gain access to the 
rod through a hole in the headstock or at the base of the neck.
 
 Tuning machines: Geared mechanisms that raise and lower the tension 
of the strings, drawing them to different pitches. The string wraps tightly 
around a post that sticks out through the top, or face, of the headstock. 
The post passes through to the back of the headstock, where gears con-
nect it to a tuning key. Tuning machines are also known as tuners, tuning 
pegs, tuning keys, tuning knobs, and tuning gears.
 
 Volume and tone controls: Knobs that adjust the loudness of the gui-
tar’s sound and its bass and treble frequencies.

The amplifier
The amplifier is an all-electronic device with no moving parts (except for 
its knobs and switches, which control the volume and tone of the incoming 
signal). You may think that those rather pedestrian-looking, geometrically 
plain boxes that do nothing but a lot of internal electrical processing are 
functional and necessary, but not particularly sexy (well, not by electric 
guitar standards, anyway). Amp lore, however, is every bit as epic and myth-
ological as guitar lore. Entire subcultures (that all, curiously, seem to have an 
Internet newsgroup devoted to their cause) are devoted to assessing, pros-
elytizing, and otherwise pondering the mysteries and myths of the perfect 
guitar amplifier. (See Chapter 2 in Book III for more on setting up your amp.)
In any quest for the perfect tone, you must have an amp in the equation, 
and the history and contributions of such legendary amp manufacturers as 
Fender, Marshall, and Vox are an inextricable part of the rock ’n’ roll gear 
legacy. Plus, you have to have someplace to set your drink when you go 
onstage. Figure 1-2 shows the various parts of an electric guitar amplifier.
 
The following list tells you the functions of the various parts of an amplifier.
 
 Cabinet: The box that houses the speaker and electronic components. 
It’s typically made of plywood or pressure-treated wood and encased in 
a durable protective covering.
 
 Effects: Many modern amps also include onboard digital signal process-
ing, such as reverb, delay, chorus, and flange.
 
 Front panel or face plate: The metal plate through which knobs and 
switches protrude to protect the controls that sit just below the surface.
 
 Grille cloth: The mesh-like fabric, usually made of a synthetic weave, 
that allows sound to pass through, but keeps foreign, and potentially 
harmful, objects (such as a boot) away from sensitive speaker surfaces.
 
 Input jack: The socket where you put the cord from your electric guitar 
or the cord from the output of the last effect in your signal chain.
 
 Power switch: A switch that turns the amp on and off.
 
 Tone switch: Two-position, or toggle, switches (not rotary or continu-
ous) that provide additional tonal control.
 
 Volume and tone controls: Rotary knobs that provide continuous con-
trol over the outgoing signal.

Effects
The newest member of the triumvirate of principal players is the group 
whose members are electronic effects. These self-contained units range in 
size anywhere from a cigarette pack to a VCR deck. Figure 1-3 shows four of 
the most common electronic effects used by rock guitarists.
Here’s what the four most common effects do:
 
 Digital delay: Creates an echo by digitally recording the signal and play-
ing it back at adjustable times after the principal signal has sounded.
 
 Chorus: Creates a thick, swirly effect of two or more guitars playing in 
tandem, but not quite with the exact tuning or timing.

mon effects

 Distortion: Simulates the sound of an amp that’s played too loud to 
handle a signal cleanly. Distortion devices are convenient: The guitar-
ist doesn’t have to keep adjusting the amp controls to get a distorted 
sound.
 
 Wah-wah: A foot-pedal, rocked by the guitarist’s foot, that creates a 
tonal variation that resembles a horn with a mute, or a human voice 
saying the phrase “wah wah” (thus the name).
Accessorizing Your Guitar
The accessories don’t stop at effects. You may also want to acquire some 
other useful, but not essential, components, including various accessories 
that all serve to make rock guitar playing a little easier. Figure 1-4 shows an 
assortment of guitar accessories that any rock guitarist should have.
String length and tension: Les Paul versus 
Stratocaster
One of the biggest differences between two 
icons of electric guitar models, the Gibson Les 
Paul and the Fender Stratocaster, is that their 
string lengths are different.
The Les Paul has a vibrating string length 
of 24.75 inches; the Strat (as it’s known to its 
friends) has a vibrating length of 25.5 inches. 
Not much difference, maybe, but enough to 
make a perceptible difference to the hands.
Physics tells us that two different string lengths 
drawn to produce the same pitch (as they must 
to be in tune) will have different tensions. The 
Strat has the longer string length, and therefore 
has slightly higher string tension than does the 
Les Paul. This creates two key differences in 
playability for the electric guitarist: tighter, or 
springier, string response and larger frets in the 
Strat; and looser, or spongier, string response 
and smaller frets in the Les Paul.

Picks
An optional item for acoustic guitarists, a pick is a near-requirement for 
playing rock guitar (exceptions include Mark Knopfler and Jeff Beck, among 
others). Sometimes called a plectrum, a pick is a small triangular- or teardrop-
shaped piece of thin plastic or nylon, about the size of a quarter, that’s held 
between the thumb and index finger of the right, or strumming, hand. When 
you strum a chord or pluck a note, you use your pick to make contact.
 
You can buy guitar picks (there’s no distinction between electric guitar and 
acoustic guitar picks) at any music store, in a variety of colors, shapes, and 
thickness (called gauges). Buy ’em by the bucketful, because you’ll lose, 
break, give away, and squander plenty in your guitar-playing career.
Straps
 
A strap is also an absolute necessity, but under only one condition: if you 
plan to play while standing. Straps can be used while sitting, but that’s a 
matter of personal preference. Most people who are interested in playing 
rock guitar live, however, will want to stand for at least some of that time. A 
strap is always a good thing to have rolled up and tucked away in your guitar 
case, even if you do most of your playing sitting down.

167
 Chapter 1: It’s Only Rock Guitar, but I Like It
Book III
Rock 
Guitar
Straps come in all materials, from leather to fabric to space-age mesh, so 
you’ll certainly be able find one that suits your sense of fashion. You can 
even have a custom-made strap with your initials or name emblazoned on the 
side that faces the audience. Looks great on TV.
Cords
A cord, sometimes referred to as a cable, is the technical term for the wire, 
or lead, that connects electric guitars to amps and other components, so 
you need at least one. If you use one electronic effects device you’ll need 
two cords — one to connect the guitar to the effect’s input, and one to con-
nect the effect’s output to the amp. If you have two effects, you’ll need three 
cords, and so on. But whether you use effects or not, carrying an extra cable 
with you is always a good idea (like straps, cables can be coiled up and unob-
trusively stashed in a guitar case). An extra cable is cheap insurance; a bad 
cable can silence you as quickly as a broken guitar neck or blown speaker.
Tuners
A tuner is a device that helps you to tune your instruments. It won’t turn the 
pegs for you, but its meters tell you when a string is flat or sharp with much 
more accuracy than your ear can — even if you have perfect pitch. (Chapter 1 
in Book I talks more about guitar tuners.) And what’s the definition of perfect 
pitch, you ask? That’s when you can toss a banjo into a Dumpster without 
hitting the sides.
Headphone and virtual amps
For $20 to $50 you can pick up a small device, such as the Vox Classic Rock 
headphone amp, and play as loud as you want without bothering your room-
mates or family. The battery-powered units plug right into your guitar and 
accept standard headphones, such as those for an iPod. Some of them come 
with effects, too, so choose according to your playing style.
You can also create classic amp and effects setups on your computer. Native 
Instruments’ Guitar Rig 3, for example, is a hardware-software combo that 
connects your guitar with your computer via a foot pedal. The onboard 
soundcard sends the signal to the speakers. The software offers lots of clas-
sic amps, cabinets, microphones, and effects. The outfit currently sells for 
around $550.

 Setting up your amp

 Setting up your sound
 Getting by without an amp
Jon Chappell here with a personal story: When I was a kid, I pined for an 
eternity (okay, it was one summer) for my first guitar, which hung, unat-
tainable, in the music store window. After several agonizing months of paper 
routes, odd jobs, and bottle recycling, I finally bought my dream guitar. As 
the salesman pulled my hard-won treasure from the window, he commented 
casually, “Yeah, good guitar you’re getting here. Whatcha got for an amp?”
An amp? I’d never even thought about it! Did I need an amp? Of course I did, 
but all my energies had gone into buying this guitar. As the meaning of his 
words flooded over me like a giant tidal wave, I realized I hadn’t even con-
sidered that I needed something to plug into to be heard. My mom wasn’t 
about to spend one red cent more than she had already contributed to my 
musical cause, so she called an electrician friend who ran an appliance repair 
store across town. To my utter humiliation, we found ourselves in a washing 
machine fix-it shop buying what looked like a converted toaster oven. It took 
me six more months to get a real amp, which helped me to get up the nerve 
to play in front of my friends (junior high school kids can be so cruel, you 
know). So take it from one who’s been there, don’t forget the amp! It does 
wonders for your guitar sound (not to mention your self-esteem).
You may not think that the amp is a very flashy player in the cast of rock 
guitar characters, especially when it has to share the limelight with its more 
glamorous counterpart, the electric guitar. But amps are essential to creat-
ing a great rock guitar sound and literally contribute one half of the effort. 
The more you understand your amp, the more passionate you become. In 
this chapter, you think “inside the box,” separating the amp system into the 
smaller sections that all amps of various makes and models have in common. 
You then drill down one level to see how you can manipulate the controls 
that govern those parts. And don’t worry, you don’t need a driver’s license — 
or even a learner’s permit — to operate one of these babies.

Part III: Rock Guitar 
 
Amps are all-electronic devices, and let’s face it, that scares some people. Or 
at least it’s intimidating enough that many beginner guitarists have a tougher 
time relating to an amp than, say, to something you can play, such as a guitar. 
Just as you can appreciate a sports car’s power and performance without 
knowing the physics of the internal combustion engine, so, too, can you 
enjoy the “internal combustion” of an amp just by taking it for a ride. Like a 
well-made car, a great amp has a personality, responds to your every move-
ment, and gives you the giddy sense that you’re sitting atop something really 
powerful. Knowing just a little bit about what’s going on under the hood of 
your amp increases not only your appreciation, but your pleasure as well.
Following the Signal Chain
An amp has a big job to do, when you think about it. It receives from the 
guitar a signal that is quite sensitive, having started life as a tiny current pro-
duced by skinny vibrating strings and a simple magnet. The amp must then 
respect the tiniest nuances of those vibrating strings, because you the player 
know exactly what you played, and if you don’t hear that at the end of the 
process — coming out of the speakers — the amp has failed in its mission.
The amp, therefore, must shepherd the signal through an electronic journey, 
all the while preserving its integrity. The amp must then switch gears, apply-
ing huge amounts of power to this once-sensitive electrical impulse, to rock 
stadiums and pulverize screaming fans. That’s not an easy task for a box with 
no moving parts.
A good amp can do all this, plus excite you as a listener and inspire you as a 
performer in the process. The electronic journey is called the signal chain. 
Technically speaking, the entire signal chain includes at its source the guitar, 
from whence the signal originates (by you striking the strings), and at its ter-
minus the speaker (which, in a “combo” configuration, is housed in the same 
box), which converts the electrical signal back into acoustic energy — you 
know, earth-shattering, filling-rattling AC/DC riffs.
In this section, you find out what happens to the signal after it’s inside the 
amplifier — this sets the stage (so to speak!) for you to better understand 
how to manipulate the controls and to shape the sound. A guitar signal’s 
journey through the amp goes something like this: An anemic (by electrical 
standards) signal enters the guitar amp at the preamp stage where sensitive 
circuitry optimized for handling low levels boosts the signal and sends it 
through to the section where the amp shapes the tone and adds effects. The 
signal then goes into the power amp, which applies massive amounts of juice 
behind it to drive speakers and produce audible — often extremely audible — 
sound waves we can crowd surf to.

171
 Chapter 2: All about Amplifiers
Book III
Rock 
Guitar
Preamp
Every amplifier, whether it’s for a guitar or keyboard — or inside a home 
stereo receiver — has two stages to actually amplify, or boost, the signal: the 
preamp and the power amp (which is covered later in this chapter). In amp 
systems made for guitars, the preamp takes the puny signal from the guitar 
(which is, after all, produced by mere magnets), jacks it up so the power amp 
can deal with it, and turns it into the screaming tones of death that eventually 
burst forth from stressed-to-the-brink speakers. The result is the sound that 
blows back the hair of the audience in the first ten rows.
The preamp is the daycare center of signal processing, designed to foster and 
nurture small impulses and guide them in their first baby steps through amp 
land. Preamps respond very well to the sensitive but relatively weak mes-
sages from the pickups.
The power amp can’t do much with an untreated guitar signal, which comes 
way under its radar, preferring instead to deal with levels that a preamp 
generates. The power amp takes whatever it sees coming at its input and 
attempts to churn out an exact copy, but thousands of times bigger (at a 
strength known as line level in electronic terms). A power amp may not be 
able to do justice to an untreated guitar signal, but it can take a preamp 
signal, puff it up, and use it to beat the stuffing out of a speaker.
Think of the preamp as a struggling talent agent and the power amp as a big 
Hollywood movie producer: The preamp polishes the talent of the small-
time artist and prepares it for the big screen — er, speaker. The power amp 
doesn’t muck about with the little people, but has the might to take the pre-
pared talent and turn it into box-office dynamite.
The idea of two volume controls is unique to guitar amplification. Normally, 
household stereo amps don’t give users separate access to the preamp and 
power amp controls. Stereo listeners just want the best fidelity (the most 
accurate signal) possible from their system. But in guitar amps, you can use 
the relationship of the preamp volume to the power amp volume to actually 
degrade the fidelity (in the form of distortion, or overdrive) to musical effect, 
as you find out later in this chapter.
Tone controls
After coming out of the preamp, the signal then passes through a series of 
electronic filters, which selectively increase or reduce the level of certain 
frequencies. Known collectively as the tone controls, these filters make up 
the equalization, or EQ, section. Applying EQ is sometimes referred to as tone 
shaping.

172
Part III: Rock Guitar 
 
You sometimes hear the term EQ (pronounced “Ee-Cue”) when discussing 
tonal issues. EQ is short for “equalization” (the bass and treble components 
of the tone) or “equalizer” (a box or circuit that affects tone). Following are 
three different uses of the term “EQ” that guitarists often hear:
 
 As an intangible noun (an entity): “The overall EQ of your guitar sound 
makes me feel like I’m chewing aluminum foil. Can’t you make it less 
harsh?”
 
 As a tangible noun (a device): “Howdy! I’m your new bass player! Can 
we borrow your 10-band EQ? I forgot mine.”
 
 As a verb: “Can you please EQ that amp so that it doesn’t sound like a 
chainsaw on a blackboard? Thank you so much.”
The tone controls on your guitar amp act just like the bass and treble knobs 
of your stereo: They make your sound boomier or tinnier. Because these 
filters don’t affect all frequencies equally (which would result in an overall 
volume increase or reduction), but only in specific ranges, we hear the resul-
tant sound as a tonal difference. Unlike a stereo receiver, however, a guitar 
amp has more than just a bass and treble control. Most amps feature at least 
one in-between knob called, logically enough, the midrange (usually abbrevi-
ated as mid) control. More sophisticated amps even have a presence control, 
which is between the midrange and treble control, and is especially suited 
to guitar frequencies. Still others have a contour control, and some have two 
knobs for the midrange that work in tandem — one to select the frequency 
and another to boost or cut the level of that frequency. But however a spe-
cific amp is configured, the controls in the tone-shaping section serve to 
change the bass, midrange, and treble content put out by the preamp.
Don’t worry too much about understanding the technical differences 
between the variously named tone controls. Good tone production involves 
knowing very little science (at least from the player’s perspective, anyway), 
because guitarists — even the best ones — just fiddle with the knobs until 
they find something they like. Fiddling with knobs is probably not the best 
way to deliver nuclear power to a city, but it works fine for guitarists search-
ing for that special tone.
Effects
From the EQ, or tone-shaping section, the signal next proceeds to the effects 
section, which usually consists of at least a reverb control, and may have 
tremolo, vibrato, or chorus. You can use effects to subtly enhance a sound, 
giving it a certain ambience, warmth, fullness, or just a little more “life.”

173
 Chapter 2: All about Amplifiers
Book III
Rock 
Guitar
Or not. You can also use effects to make your playing sound completely off 
the wall, alien, space age, underwater, distorted, tortured, or to give it any 
other wholly unnatural quality. How you use effects (on your amp and/or 
elsewhere in the signal chain) is strictly a matter of taste and depends on the 
response you want to evoke from your listeners. Ugly, scary, brutal, and just 
plain rude are all worthy qualities completely at home in rock guitar (espe-
cially for punk and heavy metal!), and you often enlist effects (along with 
sheer overpowering volume) to help you achieve your aesthetic goal. But 
unless you’re going for a really wacky sound, you find, as your playing devel-
ops, that using effects subtly is best for most musical situations.
Power amp
The final stop on the signal’s electrical journey to the speaker is the power 
amp — a robust, no-nonsense electrical place where treated but under-
powered signals get pumped up into sound-wave warriors. The power amp 
adds very little color to the sound — at least compared to the three previ-
ous stages — because its primary function is to reproduce, as faithfully as 
possible, the signal it receives from the preamp, tone, and effects sections. 
You may think, therefore, that the power amp section is comprised of fairly 
straightforward, unimaginative stuff, which actually isn’t the case.
Although its function may be simple to describe, the power amp’s processing 
is a fairly complex and demanding electronic project. In more powerful amps, 
the power amp section is bigger, heavier, and more expensive to build. And 
in tube amps, which are objects of lust among amp aficionados, the power 
amp also adds a bit of color to the sound — something it’s ideally not sup-
posed to do (that task being the exclusive domain of the preamp tubes). But 
at least where tubes are concerned, the result is so musical that guitarists 
find it pleasing and make an exception — sort of like the famous adage about 
sausage: If you love it, you don’t want to know how it’s made.
Taking a Guided Tour of the Amp
The following sections offer a walking tour through each of the amp’s individ-
ual components. The sections here are grouped linearly, from start to finish. 
The exception is the preamp and power amp volume controls, which are 
tackled simultaneously because, although they are at the front and back of 
the amp’s signal chain, respectively, you can best appreciate their functions 
and how they work together by dealing with them in tandem and in relation 
to each other — like bookends.

Boxing it in: The cabinet
The cabinet is a sturdy wooden box that houses the speaker, controls, and 
electrical guts so they don’t fall all over the floor in a great big mess. The cab-
inet protects the speaker’s surface with a grille cloth stretched taut across its 
front, serves as an anchor for the chassis (which houses the electronics) and 
the reverb tank (if present), and provides a frame for the baffle (the open-
holed board that the speaker mounts to). The cabinet is also the acoustic 
place where the speaker lives and moves, however, and therefore contributes 
to the overall sound and performance of the amp. It also supports a sweating 
beverage bottle a lot better than the headstock of a guitar. Figure 2-1 shows 
the cabinet of a typical combo amp.

net is the

The cabinet can be open in the back (exposing the amp’s interior and offer-
ing easy access to the speaker), closed, or sealed (leaving no opening), or 
“half back,” which is like an open-back cab, but with a plank of wood across 
the opening. Sonically, an open back provides a rounder fuller tone, because 
sound escapes from both sides of the amp, back and front. A closed-back 
cab yields a punchier result because all sound is forced through the front 
of the amp (producing a boost in the bass frequencies in particular), and a 
half-back cab is a mix of the two sounds, but is closer to the open-back cab in 
quality.

Taking control: The control panel
The control panel is a metal plate that plays host to the amp’s knobs, 
switches, and sockets. Under the knobs and sticking through holes in the 
control panel are shanks, or spindles, which rotate, sending messages to the 
electronic components within the chassis (the metal tray or compartment 
housing the amp’s electronics). The control panel and its knobs are often 
recessed or angled in such a way to protect them from getting damaged. This 
helps keep them from getting sheared off as you load your amp into the trunk 
of a car and you don’t quite clear the back of the trunk. (I hate when that hap-
pens.) The control panel is where the brains of the operation sit. It is to the 
signal chain what Houston is to a NASA space shuttle. Figure 2-2 shows a con-
trol panel of a typical combo amp.

Channel inputs are the sockets, or jacks, where you insert your guitar cord 
for access to a particular channel. A channel is an individual path through the 
amp’s signal-processing sections. Many amps have two channels optimized 
for producing different sounds. Typically, one channel favors setting up a 
“clean” sound, the other a high-volume, distorted sound. One input often 
serves two channels, allowing you to switch between channels instantly via 
a footswitch, without having to re-plug (see the section on channel switching 
later in this chapter).
Some multichannel, multi-input amps even accept two instruments simultane-
ously — great for keeping handy two different types of guitars that you must 
switch between quickly, such as a 12-string and a six-string, or an acoustic-
electric and a regular electric.

Preamp and power amp controls
The preamp takes a signal and boosts it so it can survive the journey through 
the tone-shaping and effects sections and wind up intact for the G-forces it’s 
subjected to in the power amp section. The power amp determines the actual 
human-hearing volume coming out of the speaker. Guitarists control the 
output of each of these stages with separate level, or volume, knobs. Figure 
2-3 shows the volume controls of the preamp and power amp.
 
Figure 2-3: 
A tale of two 
volumes: 
preamp and 
power amp, 
channel, 
and master.
 
Here’s a list of preamp and power amp controls:
 
 Gain/drive: Gain and drive are synonymous terms that simply describe 
the volume controls for the preamp. The higher you turn any preamp 
volume control, the more distortion you introduce into the signal. 
Preamp volume distorts in musically pleasing ways, however, and 
rock guitarists use that as part of their tone quality and sustain. (See 
Chapter 1 in Book III for more detailed descriptions of the electric 
guitar’s sustain and tone quality.)
 
 Volume/master volume: The power amp volume control determines the 
overall or absolute loudness of the amp. In amps containing more than 
one channel, the term master volume distinguishes the power amp con-
trol from the channels’ preamp controls. If you run the master volume 
high (on high numbers, such as 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10), the sound coming out 
of the amp is loud. If you run the master volume low (1, 2, and 3), the 
amp is soft. This is important to remember when balancing the preamp 
channel volume with the power amp master volume (see the section on 
setting the controls later in this chapter).
 
 Boost switch: Often an amp has a switch that activates a boost circuit, 
which just jacks up the power amp’s volume by a fixed level. A boost 
switch can be very handy because it keeps your basic sound intact, 

177
 Chapter 2: All about Amplifiers
Book III
Rock 
Guitar
retaining the specific tone and effects settings, and applies a volume 
increase. This way, a guitarist can have two versions of a carefully 
crafted sound: loud and really loud.
Tone controls
In the tone-shaping stage of an amp, various electronic filters add or subtract 
frequencies, giving the guitarist tonal control over the sound apart from what 
the volume and effects controls provide. Most of the tone controls are intui-
tively named and produce expected results. For example, when you turn up 
the treble you brighten the tone. Figure 2-4 shows the tone-shaping section of 
an amp’s control panel.
 
Figure 2-4: 
The tone 
controls of 
an amp’s 
EQ, or tone-
shaping, 
section.
 
Check out the following tone controls:
 
 Bass: The bass control determines how low or boomy the sound is. 
Turning up the bass provides more “girth;” turning down the bass 
reduces “rumble.”
 
 Middle or midrange: For a fuller or warmer sound, guitarists reach for 
the midrange control. Conversely, to sharpen a sound, or to accentuate 
high highs and low lows, guitarists will cut, or “dial out,” midrange fre-
quencies. Heavy metal bands such as Pantera and Metallica often cut, or 
“scoop,” their midrange frequencies.
 
 Treble: The highest of the tone controls, the treble can restore luster 
to a signal that’s become dull from passing through too many effects 
pedals. If a signal is too harsh sounding, cutting back the treble makes it 
mellower.
 
 Presence: Technically, this is a high-mid control that sonically resides 
somewhere between the mids and the treble. “Presence” is sort of a mis-
nomer because applying it doesn’t really bring the sound any closer to 

178
Part III: Rock Guitar 
the listener; it just adds a gloss or sheen. Presence can really sweeten up 
a signal, but too much of it can fatigue the ears and create a saccharine 
sound.
 
 Bright switch: The bright switch is a two-position toggle (a switch that 
alternates between two states) that selects between the normal sound 
and a brighter sound. Most rock guitarists who have amps with bright 
switches keep them on all the time. For that occasional jazzy passage, 
however, you may want to flick it to the “normal” position.
 
Don’t think that just because you adjust one control that you’re affecting only 
one range of notes. For example, turning down the treble doesn’t affect just 
the high notes; it affects the entire high frequency content of the signal. So 
even if you play only low notes, turning down the treble will affect the high 
end of those low notes, inhibiting their ability to “sparkle.”
Amp effects
Although most tone-shaping sections on amps are fairly standardized, 
amp manufacturers differ widely with respect to what effects they include. 
Following are some fairly universal effects found on many guitar amps.
 
 Reverb: Reverb is short for “reverberation” and is a basic staple guitar 
effect, one that is heard on virtually every recorded example of rock 
guitar music. Older amplifiers use metal springs (secured in a box or 
tank bolted to the inside of the cabinet) that will jiggle and make a crash-
ing sound if you shake the amp. Newer amps deliver reverb through the 
less-costly technology of microchips and digital circuitry, but the intent 
is the same: to simulate the sound of a guitar played in different acousti-
cal settings, from a small room to a concert stage to a giant cavern or 
cathedral. A single knob controls the intensity of the effect. Figure 2-5 
shows the reverb control knob on an amp.
 
Figure 2-5: 
The control 
for amp 
reverb is 
usually lim-
ited to one 
knob.

 Chapter 2: All about Amplifiers
Book III
Rock 
Guitar
 
 Tremolo: Tremolo is regular, rapid wavering of a signal’s volume. Old 
Fender amps used two controls, speed (the rate of the fluctuations) and 
intensity (to determine the distance between the loud and soft portions 
of the sound). At lower settings, the sound has a slight quiver. With the 
intensity cranked, it sounds like you’re playing through an electric fan. 
These days, newer amps include tremolo only if they’re going for that 
vintage vibe.
 
 
You sometimes hear amp tremolo described as “vibrato,” but this is a 
misnomer. Vibrato is the rapid fluctuation of pitch; tremolo the rapid 
fluctuation of volume. Fender has an entire series of amps with the prefix 
“Vibro” to describe amps sporting a feature that is actually tremolo. 
Rock guitar is full of misnomers, but that’s just part of its rebellious 
charm.
 
 Flanger: A flanger gives a kind of swirling, spacey effect to a guitar’s 
sound. It does this by mixing two identical signals, but time-delaying 
one by a varying amount to create a kind of sweeping, up-and-down-the-
sound spectrum.
 
 Chorus: Chorus simulates the sound of many guitars playing at once, cre-
ating an overall fuller sound that’s slightly swirly. Turning up the speed 
yields a warbling effect; increasing the intensity produces lush, whooshy 
sounds. Figure 2-6 shows the chorus controls of an amp made famous by 
its classic onboard chorus: the Roland JC-120.
 
Figure 2-6: 
The two 
controls that 
modify the 
chorus here 
are speed 
and depth.
 
Making a graceful exit
Other than pumping the signal out through a speaker, an amp can output 
a signal through other points. Knowing these different output destinations 
helps in understanding how the amp contributes to the quality of the sound, 
rather than just acting as a “guitar megaphone.” Alternate outputs allow for 

180
Part III: Rock Guitar 
options like sending your guitar signal to a P.A. (sound system), headphones, 
and mixing boards for recording. An amp’s output jacks are typically found 
on the back panel.
Speaker out
The main speaker out is an output jack that connects the amp’s power amp to 
its internal speaker (if it’s a combo) or to the main cab (if the amp is in a sep-
arate housing from the speaker). Some amps offer additional speaker outs for 
hooking up additional cabs. Ninety-nine times out of 100, you want your amp 
sound coming out through the speaker, because this is how electric guitars 
are heard — realized through a speaker. This is different than, say, a piano, 
flute, or even acoustic guitar where we can experience them live, without the 
benefit of a speaker. It’s only on recordings where we must enlist the aid of a 
speaker. But an electric guitar knows no audio reality — live or recorded — 
without a speaker. Even if a direct out is used (as described later in this sec-
tion), a speaker simulator is thrown in to simulate the sound of the signal 
coming through a speaker.
Headphone out
 
In the iPod era, everyone understands the importance of listening to music 
through headphones. Many amp makers realize this too, and so provide 
a headphone output for speaker-less listening. By listening to your guitar 
through headphones, you can wail away to your heart’s content (and experi-
ence thundering levels of distortion via an overdriven preamp) and still not 
disturb the person next to you watching TV. Headphone outputs are great for 
practicing late at night or in close proximity to other humans.
Direct out
You sometimes want the signal to not go into the power amp and through the 
speaker but to some other destination, such as a mixing board (for record-
ing directly onto tape or hard disk) or even to another amp. You can’t suc-
cessfully plug a guitar directly into a mixer channel, because you need the 
treatment that the amp’s preamp, tone-shaping, and possibly effects sections 
provide. But an amp’s power amp and speaker exist only to make the sound 
audible in the room, which is not necessarily what you want when sending 
a direct-out signal. You want to route the signal to a mixer or recording deck 
where you can then monitor (listen to the resultant sound) from the mixer or 
deck’s headphone jack or speakers.
Effects loop
You can insert an outboard effect device between the preamp and the power 
amp sections of the amp, which is the optimal place for many effects, like 
delay, chorus, and flange, that just sound better placed between the preamp 
and the power amp, rather than before the preamp, which is the situation 
when using pedals. If you desire an effect not provided by your amp’s built-
in circuitry, but that you have in an external box, you use the effects loop to 
“patch” it in.

181
 Chapter 2: All about Amplifiers
Book III
Rock 
Guitar
The effects loop consists of two jacks, an output and an input. With an extra 
guitar cord you plug the output (sometimes called send) of the amp into the 
input of the external effects box. You then take another cord and plug the 
output of the effects box back into the amp, at the input (sometimes called 
the return) jack. The amp has provided a “loop” for you to route the signal 
out and back in, allowing you to enhance it along the way. Figure 2-7 shows 
the diagram for plugging in an external device via the effects loop.
 
Figure 2-7: 
With an 
effects 
loop, you 
can route 
signals out 
for process-
ing and then 
back in.
 
Power amp in
You may have occasion to use your amp just for its power amp capabilities 
only — to make an external sound source (such as a CD player) audible by 
means of the amp’s speaker. In this case, the sound comes to the power amp 
from a source other than the amp’s onboard preamp. For those situations, 
you take the output of the external device and insert it into the power amp in 
jack. Doing this skips all the circuitry before the power amp stage (preamp, 
tone-shaping, and effects sections), which the CD player doesn’t need or 
want.
 
Use the power amp in jack to patch in a CD player (although you may have to 
tweak the tone controls to get a decent sound). This allows you to perform 
two common and useful tasks:
 
 Play recorded music in close proximity to your guitar-playing activities, 
instead of over the stereo speakers — wherever they are.
 
 Play recorded music through your amp on a gig during the break. (This 
is great if the venue has no “house system” of its own, or if you want to 
control what the audience hears — such as your newly minted demo!)

182
Part III: Rock Guitar 
Various other “holes”
The preceding sections tackle the important jacks that appear on most amps, 
but you may discover amp models that have additional jacks.
 
 A footswitch jack allows you to plug in a pedal that you can operate with 
your foot for instantaneous and hands-free control. Typical footswitch 
jacks include channel switching, effects on/off, and, on digital amps, 
preset advance (where you can “step through” different setups you’ve 
created and stored in the amp’s memory).
 
 High-quality amps often include several places where you can tap (gain 
access to) the signal: after the preamp, after the power amp but at non-
speaker-level (for additional processing), and speaker level (which can 
only be connected to a speaker, lest you risk damaging the amplifier’s 
circuitry).
 
 Some amps offer additional inputs, too, like an aux in, which allows 
you to plug in, say, a CD player so you can practice along with your 
favorite CD.
Sounding out: The speaker
The speaker’s function is pretty obvious to anyone who’s grown up around 
stereos, radios, and TVs: It magically converts that mystical stuff called elec-
tricity into acoustic sound waves that we can hear with our ears and feel in 
our bodies (if it’s loud enough).
For all the advancements in electronics, speakers today look and oper-
ate pretty much the same as they did half a century ago. Electricity passes 
through a cylindrical metal coil at the speaker’s center, surrounded by a 
doughnut-shaped magnet. This causes the coil to vibrate inside a magnetic 
field. The speaker’s cone of paper-like material exaggerates and amplifies this 
movement, creating audible sound. If this process sounds familiar it should: 
It’s essentially the way a pickup works — but in reverse (see Chapter 1 in 
Book III for more on the pickup’s workings).
Speakers are delicate by design, because they must react to the minute 
electrical fluctuations in the coil. Guitar amp speakers are called woofers 
(as opposed to their higher-pitched brethren, tweeters) and are suited for 
cranking out the midrange-rich frequencies of electric guitars. The majority 
of guitar speakers measure 12 inches in diameter, though 10 inches is quite 
popular too. In general, the larger the speaker, the louder and stronger it 
sounds. Figure 2-8 shows a typical guitar speaker.

Plugging In and Turning On
 
Because an amplifier plugs into the wall, and because it’s capable of deliver-
ing signals both electrical and acoustic in high doses, you must follow some 
simple but vital rules for operating an amp. Do not skip the following 
sections!
Safety first
 
First and foremost, a guitar amplifier is a high-voltage, electricity-driven 
device, such as any TV, stereo, radio, or appliance in your kitchen. Follow 
these directives to keep you and those near you safe and injury free.
 
 Never stick your hands inside the amp to check connections, to find 
loose or rattling parts, or to otherwise poke around. Even when you 
unplug the amp, its components store electricity for several minutes 
afterward.
 
 Never operate an amp with water anywhere in the vicinity, either 
on your body or in an open container. Mixing water with a plugged-in 
amp — even if it’s not turned on — can be lethal. Treat the cord to the 
wall socket with respect and care. Always turn off the power switch 
when the amp is not in use for an extended period of time, and always 
turn off the power switch before unplugging the amp.
 
 Never operate an amp in the rain or near a sprinkler or garden hose 
(which may happen if you play in a garage, backyard, or patio). Have 
fun with your music, but always treat electricity with grave seriousness.

184
Part III: Rock Guitar 
The six-step program
Following is a quick-start list of six steps for plugging your guitar in and turn-
ing it on in the right order. Doing this protects your speakers from sonic 
assaults and rude pops, and preserves your eardrums from unexpected, 
irritating — and potentially damaging — sonic blasts.
To turn on an amp:
 
1. Turn all amp volume controls off or to their minimum position.
 
2. Plug one end of the guitar cord into the guitar, the other end into 
the amp.
 
3. Turn the amp’s power switch on.
 
4. Turn the volume knob(s) of your guitar all the way up.
 
5. Turn up the amp’s master volume to about 4 or 5, or up to about 
halfway.
 
6. Slowly turn the preamp or channel volume knob up and check for 
the presence of audible signal by strumming your guitar.
Here’s how you reverse the process to ensure a safe and pop-free shutdown 
routine. To shut off an amp:
 
1. Turn off the guitar’s volume knob(s).
 
 Do this as a courtesy so unintended sound won’t escape from the ring-
ing open strings as you reach over to the amp’s controls.
 
2. Turn down the amp’s master volume controls.
 
3. Optional: Turn down the channel or preamp volume control(s).
 
 Do this as a courtesy to the next player — even if that’s you — so she 
can make her own preamp adjustments. Conversely, you can keep the 
preamp volume level where it is to recall easily your sound upon restart.
 
4. Turn off the power switch.
 
5. Optional: If you’re leaving the amp unattended for a long period of 
time, or you can’t predict who will be in the room with the amp when 
you’re not there, unplug the amp from the wall socket.
 
6. Unplug the cord from the amp, and unplug the cord from the guitar.
Additional hints:
 
 Never unplug a guitar cord — from either the guitar or the amp — with-
out first turning down the master volume knob all the way.

185
 Chapter 2: All about Amplifiers
Book III
Rock 
Guitar
 
 
Sudden loud noises in the form of “pops” from inopportunely connected 
or disconnected cords can damage the speaker (and at the very least 
are amateurish and annoying).
 
 Never move an amp any significant distance without turning down the 
volume and shutting off the power. This is important to consider when 
you’re attached to a long extension cord.
 
 When plugging different guitars into one amp in rapid succession (such 
as when you’re auditioning a bunch of guitarists), turn down only the 
master volume control. This shuts off the signal from reaching the 
speaker. Note the volume knob’s position before you bring it down so 
you can restore it to the same place after you have safely unplugged and 
plugged in the guitar cord.
Getting a Sound
When you have an understanding of the amp’s different sections and the con-
trols that govern them, use them to set up your own sound. You can’t make 
any mistakes when creating a sound, so experiment until you find something 
you like — something that’s not too loud or too soft, too muddy or too shrill. 
Then go from there.
First decide what kind of sound you want. Something clean and crisp, say, 
for chords? Or something raunchy and snarly for low-note Led Zeppelin-type 
riffs (self-contained single-note phrases). Always have a vision in your mind’s 
eye — make that ear — of what you’re seeking, rather than blindly spinning 
controls hoping to stumble onto something you like.
Setting the controls
 
Start with your tone controls in the 12:00 position, or at “5,” so they’re flat 
(adding no boost or cut). That will help you hear your basic guitar sound in 
the amp’s most neutral setting. Turn off all effects too, so you hear the pure 
guitar signal through the circuitry. Then decide whether you want a sound 
that’s clean or distorted. Figure 2-9 shows an amp with its controls in the neu-
tral position.
 
 Clean: The term clean in guitar parlance simply means distortion free 
and is not necessarily better or worse than an overdriven, or heavily dis-
torted, sound. You can obtain a clean sound by running the power amp 
volume (or master volume) high and the channel, or preamp, volume 
relatively low. If you want the sound louder, turn up the master volume, 
not the channel volume.

186
Part III: Rock Guitar 
 
 Distorted: If you’re trying to get a distorted sound from an older amp 
that has no separate volume controls for the channel and the master 
(sometimes referred to as non-master-volume models), you have but one 
choice: crank that sucker until the sound starts to break up. In the pro-
cess, hope that the neighbors don’t call the police. If your amp has two 
volume controls, though, your options are a little more versatile. Set up 
the master volume to about halfway, and bring up the channel volume to 
a comfortable listening level (whatever that is, depending on your envi-
ronment).
 
 To create a distorted sound using the two volume controls in conjunc-
tion with each other, turn up the channel volume and compensate for 
the increased volume by turning down the master volume. By turning 
down the master as you turn up the channel, your overall loudness 
should remain fairly constant. But as the preamp works harder and 
harder, it will begin to distort — even though the volume doesn’t 
change. The twin-volume approach to distortion is a beautiful thing 
for guitarists, because it means you can achieve overdriven preamp 
distortion at low volumes.
 
 
Don’t get too caught up in all the semantics and synonyms for distortion. 
Technically, distortion is the result of any signal that gets overdriven.

controls in a

tion with

Figure 2-10 shows two setups, one clean, and the other overdriven. In both 
settings the overall volume — or absolute loudness — is about the same. 
Only the distortion content changes.

Channel switching
Most modern amps that allow you to create sounds on separate channels 
also allow you to switch between them by means of a front-panel switch. This 
enables you to set up two channels independently and switch between them 
instantly and at will. Typically, you assign two contrasting sounds for these 
channels, such as clean and distorted, or variations on those qualities (per-
haps “ultra-sheen” and “super-stun”).
Careful crafting of two independent clean and distorted sounds may produce 
righteous tones on their own, but they aren’t much use to a guitarist who 
in the same song wants a clean sound on the verses (to, say, accompany a 
singer), and mondo-distortion for the Big Guitar Solo (and rock guitarists 
should insist every song include at least one of these). In a single-channel 
amp, reconfiguring the controls for real-time use between song sections is a 
practical impossibility, and in multiple channels, even throwing a front-panel 
switch requires the guitarist to take one hand off the instrument and reach 
for the amp. And hey, who has that kind of time?
The footswitch is an inexpensive (about $20, if not already included with the 
amp), “stompable” device that sits on the floor and plugs in the back of your 
amp. Its sole purpose in life is to alternate between two states — 1 and 2, A 
and B, on and off, and so on. A footswitch allows the guitarist to play with 
both hands on the guitar the entire time, and when the moment comes to 
switch seamlessly from dutiful backup drudge to distortion-diva superstar, 
she can step surreptitiously on a pedal and have her sound magically and 
instantly launch into hyperspace.
A footswitch has other uses besides hands-free channel switching. You can 
use a footswitch to turn your effects on and off. Or you can try to step on 
two footswitches at once, to turn on the effects and to change channels. 
This sometimes poses a problem because you have to twist your foot side-
ways so your toe and heel can simultaneously press two switches at once. 
Miscalculation of this move may leave audience members wondering, “Why 
did that knock-kneed guitarist suddenly fall over just before the guitar solo?”

188
Part III: Rock Guitar 
Making Do If You Don’t Have an Amp
Certainly a guitar amp is an important thing to have. But sometimes you 
simply have to choose between getting a really good guitar now and waiting 
for an amp, or spending the same money for two pieces — and comprising on 
the quality of both.
For those who have faced this cosmic struggle, know that you have alternate 
means of amplification available to you that won’t cost nearly as much as a 
quality amplifier. You may even have the technology right now and not even 
realize it. (Cue mysterious organ music.)
Plugging into a home stereo or boombox
You can get away without buying an amp at all, if you plug your electric 
guitar into the auxiliary input of your home stereo. All you need is a special, 
inexpensive adapter. You can readily purchase these devices at electronic 
or music stores for less than $5. (Just tell the salesperson what you want to 
do, and he can supply the correct unit.) The adapter is just a metal or plastic-
coated plug that has a female 1/4-inch jack on one end and a male RCA (some-
times called phono) plug on the other. Many boomboxes have inputs as well, 
but use a 1/8-inch connection, so for one of these you need a female 1/4-inch 
jack on one end and a male 1/8-inch stereo plug on the other. Make sure, if 
you buy your adapter at a place other than a music store, that the adapter’s 
female end is mono; that’s the end you plug your guitar cord into.
 
Before you go plugging anything in to a stereo or boombox, make sure the 
volume control on the receiver is all the way down. This precaution prevents 
any sudden pop or surge in the system, which can potentially damage the 
speakers.
Because you plug into, say, the left input of your receiver, you hear music 
only out of the left speaker. This is normal. Some higher-end receivers enable 
you to set the output mode (the stereo configuration) of the source signal. If 
you see a bunch of settings such as L, R, L+R, and so on, set that knob to L 
(which routes the left channel to both speakers). The resultant sound is not 
stereo, but it sounds fuller and more widely dispersed than if your guitar 
comes out of only one speaker. And hey, it’s better than a converted toaster 
oven any day!
Figure 2-11 shows how to plug into the back of your receiver. Plug one end 
of the guitar cord into your guitar and the other end into the adapter. Check 
to see that the receiver’s volume is down. Plug the adapter into the left 
auxiliary input in the back of your receiver. On the receiver’s front panel, 

189

Rock 
Guitar
select “Aux 1” or whatever is the corresponding name of the input into which 
you plugged your guitar. (It may be called “Tape 1” or some other name — 
check the input itself or your owner’s manual if in doubt.) Turn your guitar’s 
volume up full. Then slowly turn up the receiver’s volume knob until you 
hear sound at a comfortable listening level. You can adjust the receiver’s 
tone controls to better shape your sound as well.

Headphone amps
Because of the miniaturization of all things electronic, you can now get 
full-sounding, authentic guitar sounds from a unit the size of a disposable 
camera — as long as you listen to it through headphones (meaning that it has 
no speaker or power amp of its own). These strap-on wonders are battery 
powered for untethered practicing (great for walking into the bathroom and 
standing in front of the mirror to check your stage moves). And virtually all 
headphone amps offer distortion, EQ, reverb, and other digital effects, many 
of them simultaneously. So a headphone amp can usually double as a multi-
effects processor, which is quite cool.
Headphone amps also provide numerous presets — sounds preprogrammed, 
or set up, by the manufacturer, plus full stereo sound (especially effective 
over headphones). Headphone amps are great for playing in a moving vehi-
cle, at the beach, in a hotel room, or in the airport lounge, and they can even 
output the signal to tape or disk, suitable for recording. The cost starts from 
about $200 (the Korg Pandora, Scholz Rockman, Ibanez Rock ’n’ Play, and 
Zoom 9000 series are just some makes and models) and are well worth the 
price if portability, privacy, and authentic tone are important for your prac-
tice routine. Figure 2-12 shows a headphone amp for guitar.

Demystifying the Gizmology
Amp functions and their controls may seem daunting at first, but if you just 
remember to break them down to their basic sections, you’ll have a much 
better time dealing with them. When you shop for an amp and are faced with 
myriad choices, remember that the rows of dials, knobs, and switches all 
have common purposes among models. Occasionally, you see something 
unique to that manufacturer or model, but if you come prepared in the 
basics, you should have an easier time recognizing what that feature is and to 
what section it belongs.
 
Above all, don’t let the number of knobs intimidate or impress you. The 
important thing about an amp is how it sounds — and more specifically, how 
it sounds to you when you play your guitar through it. Some of the best amps 
in the world have very few knobs and look rather low tech.
So make sure you check out an amp the way you would a guitar — by listen-
ing to it as well as playing through it, and developing a rapport and feel for 
the vibe it produces.

L
ead guitar is without a doubt the most spectacular and dazzling feature 
of rock guitar playing. Lead guitar can embody emotions that run the 
gamut from mournful and soulful to screaming, frenzied abandon — some-
times in the same solo. Whereas riffs are grounded, composed, and can mani-
fest their power through their unflinching solidity, lead is beckoned by the 
music to launch into divinely inspired flights of fancy — to be forever 
soaring.
The greatest lead rock guitarists, from Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix to Eddie 
Van Halen and Steve Vai, have all been able to soar, but they have also all 
been disciplined masters of their instruments. They have resolved the ulti-
mate artistic paradox: total freedom through total control.
Left-hand movement and precise single-string picking are the focus in this 
chapter. As you begin developing the basic technique for playing lead, never 
forget that your playing possesses the potential for evoking enormous emo-
tional power. And kick over a few amplifiers while you’re at it too!
Taking the Lead
You must play many before you can play one, Grasshopper.
This saying of unknown but vaguely Eastern origin certainly applies to rock 
guitar playing, because you need to learn to play chords (note groupings of at 
least three notes) before you can learn single notes — the stuff of leads.

192
Part III: Rock Guitar 
Actually, you don’t have to learn chords before lead, but in rock guitar it’s a 
good idea, at least from a technical standpoint, because when playing rhythm 
you don’t have to be as precise with your right-hand motions. Most beginning 
guitarists find striking multiple strings easier than plucking individual ones. 
(You can find the basics of rhythm techniques in Chapter 4 in Book II.)
Now, however, the time has come to venture into the world of single-note 
playing, where you pick only one string at a time, and which string you play 
is critical. Single-note playing also involves a lot more movement from the left 
hand.
Single-note takes on a number of different musical forms. Four of the most 
important ones for playing rock include the following:
 
 Melody: A major component of single-note playing on the guitar is 
melody. Melody can be the composed tune of the song played instru-
mentally, or it can be an improvised break or solo, using the melody as 
the point of departure.
 
 Arpeggio: An arpeggio is playing a chord one note at a time, so, by defi-
nition, it’s a single-note technique. You can use arpeggios as an accom-
paniment figure (as you do in the fingerstyle example in Chapter 4 in 
Book II) or as lead material, as many hard rock and heavy metal guitar-
ists, such as Eddie Van Halen and Randy Rhoads, have done. Lead gui-
tarists burn up many a measure just by playing arpeggios in their lead 
breaks, and the results can be thrilling.
 
 Riff: A riff is a self-contained musical phrase, usually composed of single 
notes and used as a structural component of a song or song section. A 
riff straddles the line between melody and rhythm guitar because it con-
tains elements of both. A riff is typically repeated and serves as a back-
ing figure for a song section.
 
 Think of the signature riffs to the Beatles’ “Day Tripper” and “Birthday,” 
the Rolling Stones’ “Satisfaction,” Aerosmith’s “Walk This Way,” Cream’s 
“Sunshine of Your Love,” Led Zeppelin’s “Whole Lotta Love” and “Black 
Dog,” Ozzy Osbourne’s “Crazy Train,” and Bon Jovi’s “You Give Love a 
Bad Name.” These are all songs based on highly identifiable and memo-
rable riffs.
 
 Riffs aren’t always composed of just single notes. Deep Purple’s “Smoke 
on the Water” and Black Sabbath’s “Iron Man” are actually composed 
of multiple-sounding notes moving in unison. And two or more guitars 
can play riffs in harmony too. The Allman Brothers and the Eagles are 
famous for this.
 
 Free improvisation: This isn’t a recognized technical term, but you can 
think of free improvisation as lead material not necessarily derived from 
the melody. It doesn’t even have to be melodic in nature. Wide inter-
val skips, percussive playing, effects used as music, and melodic note 
sequences (such as patterns of fast repeated notes, or even one note) 
can all contribute to an exciting lead guitar solo or passage.

193
 Chapter 3: Playing Lead
Book III
Rock 
Guitar
The terms lead, melody, single line, riff, solo, and improv are all types of 
single-note playing and are often used interchangeably. The phrase single-
note playing is a little cumbersome, so you can refer to any playing that is not 
rhythm playing as lead playing, even if it’s to indicate playing a riff.
 
Strictly speaking, lead playing is the featured guitar, which is usually playing 
a single-note-based line. But it doesn’t always have to be playing only single 
notes; it could be playing double-stops, which are two notes played together 
(they’re introduced in Chapter 5 in Book II). Also, the designation lead guitar 
helps to distinguish that guitar from the other guitar(s) in the band that are 
playing rhythm guitar.
The yin and yang of rhythm and lead
If a band has two guitarists, a logical division of 
duties is to have one guitarist play rhythm and 
the other play lead. Often, the better guitarist 
is the lead guitarist. Sometimes, though, you 
divide the duties not necessarily for reasons of 
musical talent, but because the rhythm guitar-
ist is the principal songwriter (as in the case of 
Tom Petty and Metallica). In many bands with 
two guitarists, the divisions of lead and rhythm 
are not clearly defined, as with Lynyrd Skynyrd, 
the Allman Brothers, and Judas Priest. In the 
following list, however, the duties between lead 
and rhythm are (or were) clearly separated.

Part III: Rock Guitar 
Sometimes the featured guitar can consist of a strummed chordal figure. The 
guitar break in Buddy Holly’s “Peggy Sue” and the opening riff to the Who’s 
“Pinball Wizard” are two standout examples of the rhythm guitar taking a fea-
tured role.
Holding the pick
You don’t need to hold the pick any differently for lead playing than you do 
for rhythm playing. Have the tip of the pick extending perpendicularly from 
the side of your thumb and bring your hand close to the individual string 
you want to play. You may find yourself sometimes gripping the pick a little 
more firmly, especially when you dig in to play loudly or aggressively. This is 
fine. In time, the pick becomes almost like a natural extension of one of your 
fingers.
Attacking the problem
The sounding or striking of a note, in musical terms, is called an attack. It 
doesn’t necessarily mean you have to do it aggressively; it’s just a term that 
differentiates the beginning of the note from the sustain part (the part that 
rings, after the percussive sound).
To attack an individual string, position the pick so it touches or is slightly 
above the string’s upper side (the side toward the ceiling) and bring it 
through with a quick, smooth motion. Use just enough force to clear the 
string, but not enough to sound the next string down. This motion is known 
as a downstroke, which is just like the downstroke discussed in Chapter 4 
in Book II, except that here you strike only one string. To play an upstroke, 
simply reverse the motion.
The ups and downs of lead playing
 
Striking a string with a downward motion is called a downstroke and is 
indicated by the symbol 2. Striking the string by bringing the hand up is 
called an upstroke and is indicated by the symbol 4. In rock guitar, rhythm 
guitarists tend to favor downstrokes. Downstrokes are more forceful and 
are generally used to accentuate notes to play even, deliberate rhythms. 
Alternating downstrokes and upstrokes is called alternate picking (covered 
later in this chapter) and is essential for playing lead guitar.

Playing Single Notes
Playing chords involves a lot of arm and wrist movement. Single-note playing 
requires much less arm movement, because most of the energy comes from 
the wrist. You may be tempted to anchor the heel of your right hand on the 
bridge, which is okay as long as you don’t unintentionally dampen the strings 
in the process.
As you move from playing notes on the lower strings to notes on the higher 
strings, your right-hand heel will naturally want to adjust itself and slide 
along the bridge. Of course, you don’t have to anchor your hand on the 
strings at all, either; you can just let your hand float in the area above the 
bridge.
 
Even when you play loud and aggressively, your right-hand movements 
should remain fairly controlled and contained. When you see your favorite 
rock stars on stage flailing away, arms wildly windmilling in circular motions 
of large diameters, that’s rhythm playing, not single-note playing.
In the following sections, you start out with some easy exercises for learning 
to play single notes on the guitar and then move to things that actually sound 
cool and are fun to play.
Single-note technique
Using all downstrokes, play the music in Figure 3-1. These are six passages, 
each on separate strings that require you to play three different notes. All the 
melodies are in quarter notes, which means the notes come one per beat (or 
one per foot tap if you’re tapping along in tempo).
The trick here is to play single notes on individual strings accurately, with-
out accidentally hitting the wrong string. You don’t have to play any fancy 
rhythms or down- and upstroke combinations; you just have to hit the 
desired string cleanly. Obviously, it’s harder to do that on the interior strings 
(2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th) than on exterior ones (1st, 6th).
 
Each exercise is written in a different feel (as evidenced by the CD record-
ing), but don’t let that throw you. As long as you count out the quarter notes 
with the count-off on the CD (heard as the percussive click of the struck 
hi-hat cymbals, as a drummer would do when counting off a song) and focus 
on playing smooth, one-note-per-foot-tap notes, you should do fine.

Book III

Guitar
The next exercise is a bit harder, because it requires you to switch strings 
as you play. When you play the example in Figure 3-2, try to go between the 
strings smoothly, without breaking the rhythm, and without varying your 
dynamics (the intensity of your pick attack) as you switch strings.

Track 30, 1:12
 
As a guitarist, you not only have to focus on keeping the rhythm steady 
between bars, but also when switching strings.
Alternate picking in down- and upstrokes
You double the pace by introducing eighth notes into your playing. Keep in 
mind that in rhythm playing, you can often play eighth notes by just speeding 
up your downstroke picking. But in lead playing, you must always play eighth 
notes using the technique called alternate picking.
 
Alternate picking requires you to follow a simple rule: Downbeat notes are 
played with downstrokes; upbeat notes are played with upstrokes. Sounds 
mundanely simple, but in practice, maintaining this strict alternating pattern 
while crossing — and even skipping — strings can be difficult. Still, alternate 
picking works, even when it seems illogical, or at least inefficient, and virtu-
ally every guitarist on the planet who plays with any facility uses alternate 
picking.
The alternate-picking technique doesn’t care whether you have to cross 
strings or not. In an eighth-note melody, the alternate-picking technique 
requires that the downbeat notes take downstrokes and the upbeat notes 
(the ones that fall in between the beats) take upstrokes — which should be 
easy to remember.

198
Part III: Rock Guitar 
Scales
By definition, a scale proceeds in stepwise motion. Scales are the dreaded 
means of musical torture wielded by Dickensian disciplinarians (like your 
fourth-grade piano teacher), but they do serve a purpose. They’re a great 
way to warm up your fingers within a recognizable structure, and they reveal 
available notes on the fingerboard within a key.
Plus, playing scales provides a familiar-sounding melody (do re mi fa sol la ti 
do) that yields a certain satisfaction upon correct execution — at least until 
you’ve done them two or three billion times and you can’t stand it anymore. 
But for now, you’re going to try an ascending, contiguously sequenced set 
of natural notes in the key of C beginning on the root (the 1st degree of the 
scale or chord) — a C major scale.
Playing in the majors
Figure 3-3 is a one-octave C major scale in eighth notes. Note that the pick-
stroke indications are given for the first two beats, and then the term sim. 
(which is short for simile, or “in the same fashion”) tells you to continue on in 
the same way.
 
Figure 3-3: 
A one-
octave C 
major scale, 
ascend-
ing and 
descending.
 
Left-hand fingerings are also provided in the standard music notation staff. 
The idea is not that you sight read all this stuff — the notes, the right- and 
left-hand indications, and so forth — but that you learn this C scale and play 
it whenever you feel like warming up. Or you can just play the scale when 
inspiration waits in the wing space of your mind, mute and mocking, and you 
can’t think of anything else musically cohesive to play.
Now for another scale that’s musically about the same, but in a different key, 
and somewhat harder to play. Figure 3-4 shows a two-octave G major scale, 
ascending and descending. What makes it harder is the left-hand fingering: 
You use all of your left-hand fingers for this scale, in a four-fret span.

199
 Chapter 3: Playing Lead
Book III
Rock 
Guitar
 
Figure 3-4: 
A two-
octave G 
major scale,

ing and

Keep your left hand fairly stationary above the strings, and let your fingers 
stretch and reach for their correspondingly numbered fret (the first, or index, 
finger plays the 1st fret; the second, or middle, finger, plays the 2nd fret; and 
so forth). As your hand becomes more agile, your finger span will widen and 
you’ll be able to reach the frets comfortably while keeping your left hand 
almost perfectly stationary.
A minor adjustment
Because you backed into scales by way of stepwise motion, you should get 
equal time with the major scale’s gloomier cousin, the minor scale.
Actually the “family” analogy isn’t that far off because minor scales are 
related to major scales. Every major scale has a corresponding minor scale, 
the relative minor, which you can play in its entirety using the same key sig-
nature. In any major key, the natural minor scale (so called because you can 
play it naturally, with no altering of the major-scale notes) begins at the 6th 
degree. (For more on all of this, see Chapter 3 in Book VII.)
So in the key of C, the 6th degree would be A (remember the musical alpha-
bet only goes up to G), so Am is the relative minor of C major. Figure 3-5 is a 
minor scale, in eighth notes, starting on the open 5th string, A.

Skips
Skips are melodic movements of noncontiguous letter names, such as A, C, 
E, G, B. Skips can be of any interval and don’t have to follow the notes of 
a chord. So all arpeggios are skips (but not all skips are arpeggios). Figure 
3-6 shows an Am7 arpeggio. The notes of the chord are played one after the 
other: A-C-E-G.
 
Figure 3-6: 
An Am7 
arpeggio.
 
Combining steps and skips
Most melodies are composed of a mix of stepwise motion and skips, and 
sometimes melodies can include an arpeggio (such as in the Army bugle calls 
“Taps” and “Reveille”). Scales, again, are a series of notes organized by key, 
where you play the notes in order, ascending and/or descending. Arpeggios 
can be skips in any order, but are limited to the notes of the chord.
Starting at the Bottom: 
Low-Note Melodies
For some reason, all traditional guitar method books start with the guitar’s 
top strings and work their way down to the low strings. But in the true rebel-
lious spirit of both rock ’n’ roll and the For Dummies series, this book starts 
at the bottom.

201
 Chapter 3: Playing Lead
Book III
Rock 
Guitar
The reason for starting at the bottom is not just pure rebelliousness, either 
(although it certainly is fun to be contrary for its own sake!): It’s because the 
impetus for so many of the world’s greatest melodies, riffs, and rock rhythm 
figures have low-born origins (from a guitar perspective, anyway). Think 
of all the classic riffs already mentioned in this chapter — “Smoke on the 
Water,” “Iron Man,” “Day Tripper” — and how many of them are low-note 
riffs.
So in that spirit, try Figure 3-7, which is a low-note melody in the style of 
a classic-rock riff. Note how it almost revels in its own subterranean girth. 
Spinal Tap would be proud.

Figure 3-8 is another melody, nimbler than the one in Figure 3-7. This figure 
moves in steady eighth notes and features some unexpected changes in 
direction. It also contains a series of melodic skips, which in this case is an 
arpeggio because it outlines the notes of an A minor chord.

Going to the Top: High-Note Melodies
Lead playing typically exploits the upper registers of the guitar, where 
melodic material is most naturally situated. Before you get really high up on 
the neck, play the melodic example in Figure 3-9 to hear the ability of the gui-
tar’s upper registers to cut through the rhythm section’s din.

Track 31, 0:26
 
If your guitar sounds twangy instead of smooth and creamy, try increasing 
the distortion factor of your sound. See Chapter 2 in Book III for information 
on how to dial up a more distorted sound if necessary.
Playing in Position
So far you’ve played all of your melodies and exercises in the lower regions of 
the neck, between the 1st and 4th frets. This is where it’s easiest to place the 
notes that you see written on paper onto frets of the guitar neck.
 
But the guitar has many more frets on the neck than just the first four. 
Playing in the lowest regions of the neck is where you play most of your low-
note riffs, a lot of chords, and some lead work, but the bulk of your lead play-
ing takes place in the upper regions of the neck for two reasons:
 
 The higher on the neck you are, the higher the notes you can hit. The 
guitar is sort of a low instrument — in fact, the notes you read on the 
treble clef are actually an octave higher than the notes of the guitar. 
For this reason, it’s a good idea to get as far up the neck as possible if 
you want to distinguish yourself melodically above the low-end rumble 
of basses, drums — and, of course, other guitars playing rhythm in the 
lower range.

203
 Chapter 3: Playing Lead
Book III
Rock 
Guitar
 
 Up the neck the strings are more flexible and easily manipulated by 
the left hand, which means you have better expressive opportunities 
for bends, vibrato, hammer-ons, pull-offs, slides, and other expressive 
devices.
Open position
Playing in open position is where you’ve spent your time thus far, but by 
design. When you have complete command of the entire neck and you can 
play anywhere you can find the note, playing in open position will be a 
choice. In other words, ultimately you should play in open position only 
because you want to, because it suits your musical purpose.
Rock guitar uses both open position and the upper positions (the positions’ 
names are defined by where the left-hand index finger falls) for the different 
musical colorings they offer. By contrast, jazz guitar tends to avoid open 
position completely, and folk guitar uses open position exclusively. But rock 
uses both, and so you need to understand the strengths offered by both open 
position and the upper positions.
Remember the G scale of Figure 3-4? That’s an open position G scale because 
it uses the open strings of the guitar. Now it’s time to explore playing the 
same exact notes in the same exact rhythm another way.
Movable, or closed, position
Playing in a movable position allows you to take a passage of music and play 
it anywhere on the neck. If you play a melody on all fretted strings (incor-
porating no open strings), it doesn’t matter if you play it at the 1st fret or 
the 15th. The notes will preserve the same melodic relationship. It’s sort of 
like swimming: After you learn the technique of keeping yourself afloat and 
moving, it doesn’t matter if the water is 5 feet or 5 miles deep — except if 
you’re in 5-mile deep water, it’s probably a lot colder.
A movable position is sometimes called closed position, because it involves 
no open strings. After you play anything on all-fretted strings, you have 
created a great opportunity to slide it anywhere on the neck and have it 
play exactly the same — except of course that you’re apt to find yourself 
in another key. This has equally profound implications for chords, as you 
find out in Chapter 3 in Book II in the sections on movable chords and barre 
chords.

204
Part III: Rock Guitar 
The best part is the ability to move closed-position melodies around — 
instantly transposing their key — which is something that no piano player, 
trumpet player, or flute player can do easily, and they’ll be eternally jealous 
of you.
To demonstrate a movable position, first take your two-octave G major scale 
and play exactly the same pitches, but place them on all fretted strings. 
Figure 3-10 is, then, a two-octave G major scale in 2nd position. It’s 2nd posi-
tion because the lowest fret played defines the position’s name, and here it’s 
the 2nd fret.
 
Figure 3-10: 
A two-
octave G 
major scale 
in 2nd 
position.
 
After you master Figure 3-10, try sliding your hand up and down the neck, 
playing the scale in different positions. By doing this you’ll transpose your G 
major scale into other keys.
Getting in Tune with 
Lower Register Riffs
The example on low-note melodies earlier in this chapter tackles the topic of 
riffs, but now you should take a look at them in earnest — not because they 
help illustrate alternate picking or string-crossing strings, but for their own 
sake. Finally, you’re making music to make music!

205
 Chapter 3: Playing Lead
Book III
Rock 
Guitar
The best thing about the lower register of the guitar is its powerful bass 
notes. You simply have no better arsenal for grinding out earth-shattering, 
filling-rattling, brain-splattering tones than the lower register of the guitar, so 
this is where 99 percent of all the greatest riffs are written.
Start off with a classic riff in quarter notes, called, variously, boogie-woogie, 
boogie, or walking bass. Figure 3-11 is a classic boogie figure using only the 
notes of the chord, plus one, the 6th degree, in a fixed pattern for each chord. 
But notice that its repetition is its strength. Your ears want to hear the same 
pattern for each of the chords, so infectious is the sound!

Making It Easy: The Pentatonic Scale
The major and minor scales may be music-education stalwarts, but as 
melodic material they sound, well, academic when used over chord progres-
sions. Rock guitarists have a much better scale to supply them with melodic 
fodder: the pentatonic scale. The pentatonic scale isn’t the only scale avail-
able for playing rock lead, but it’s the most widely used and easiest to learn. 
The beauty of this scale is that it sounds great over every chord change in a 
key, and you can begin to make music with it almost immediately.

206
Part III: Rock Guitar 
As its name implies, the pentatonic scale contains five notes, which is two 
notes shy of the normal seven-note major and minor scales. This creates a 
more open and less linear sound than either the major or minor scale. The 
pentatonic scale is also more ambiguous, but this is a good thing, because 
it means that it’s harder to play bad notes — notes that, although they’re 
within the key, may not fit well against any given chord in the progression. 
The pentatonic scale uses just the most universal note choices.
 
The importance of the pentatonic scale can’t be emphasized enough. It ranks 
with anesthesia, the printing press, and the cordless screwdriver as indis-
pensable to modern civilization.
The first scale you should learn is the A minor pentatonic. A minor pen-
tatonic can be used as a lead scale over chord progressions in A minor, C 
major, and A blues (“blues” can imply a specific, six-note scale, as well as a 
chord progression). It also works pretty well over A major and C blues. Not 
bad for a scale that’s two notes shy of a major scale.
Figure 3-12 is a neck diagram outlining a pentatonic scale form in 5th posi-
tion. The neck is positioned as if you’re facing a guitar that is laid on its side, 
with the neck to your left. So it looks like tablature in the sense that the first 
string is on top, but it’s a schematic of the actual neck instead of the tab staff. 
On Track 33 on the CD, it’s played from top (1st string, 8th fret) to bottom 
(6th string, 5th fret) in quarter notes. Try playing it, and don’t worry about 
playing along in rhythm with the CD; the track is just there so you can make 
sure you’re in the right position hitting the right notes.

In the neck diagram, just like in a tab staff, the 1st string is the top line. This 
isn’t a chord, but all the available notes for the pentatonic scale. The left-
hand index finger plays all the notes on the 5th fret; the ring finger plays all 
the 7th-fret notes; and the little finger plays all the 8th-fret notes. In this par-
ticular scale pattern, the middle finger doesn’t play at all.
Playing the Pentatonic Scale: 
Three Ways to Solo
In the following sections you learn to play one pentatonic scale pattern in 
three different musical contexts:
 
 A progression in a major key
 
 A progression in a minor key
 
 A blues progression
You can use just one pattern to satisfy all three musical settings. This is an 
unbelievable stroke of luck for beginning guitarists, and you can apply a 
shortcut, a quick mental calculation, that allows you to instantly wail away in 
a major-key song, a minor-key song, or a blues song — simply by performing 
what is essentially a musical parlor trick. This is a great quick-fix solution to 
get you playing decent-sounding music virtually instantly. As you get more 
into the music, however, you’ll want to know why these notes are working 
the way they do. But until then, let’s jam!
Place your index finger on the 5th fret, 1st string. Relax your hand so your 
other fingers naturally drape over the neck, hovering above the 6th, 7th, and 
8th frets. You are now in 5th position, ready to play. Work to play each note 
singly, from top to bottom, so you get your fingers used to playing the frets 
and switching strings. Don’t worry about playing downstrokes and upstrokes 
until you’re comfortable moving your left-hand fingers up and down the 
strings, like a spider walking across its web.
Now try Figure 3-13, a descending scale in C pentatonic major in eighth notes, 
beginning with your left-hand little finger on the 1st string, 8th fret.

This particular pentatonic pattern allows you to keep your left hand station-
ary; all the fingers can reach their respective fret easily without stretching or 
requiring left-hand movement.
Now that you’ve played the scale, try it in a musical context. This is where 
you witness the magic that transpires when you play the same notes over dif-
ferent feels in different keys. Let the games begin!
Pentatonics over a major key
Figure 3-14 is a C major progression in a medium-tempo 4/4 groove. The writ-
ten solo is a mix of quarter notes and eighth notes comprised of notes from 
the C major pentatonic scale, moving up and down the neck. The left channel 
of your CD has the rhythm instruments, and the right features the lead guitar. 
As soon as you get the idea about how the lead sounds, dial it out and try to 
play the melody against the recorded rhythm sound by yourself. Then check 
your work by dialing back in the right channel and see how close you got.
Pentatonics over a minor key
And now, as Monty Python once said, for something completely different. 
Or is it? In Figure 3-15, the feel changes (to a heavy back-beat 4/4), the key 
changes (to A minor), but you still play the same notes. Notice the strikingly 
different results.

Improvising Leads
In rock, jazz, and blues, improvisation plays a great role. In fact, being a 
good improviser is much more important than being a good technician. It’s 
much more important to create honest, credible, and inspired music through 
improvisation than it is to play with technical accuracy and perfection.
The best musicians in the world are the best improvisers, but they’re not 
necessarily the best practitioners of the instrument. About the only thing 
that competes with the ability to improvise a good solo is the ability to write 
a song.
And so the last exercise in this chapter is devoted to improvising — where 
you take a collection of notes and turn it into music. To do this, use the 
5th-position pentatonic scale you learned earlier in this chapter. Figure 3-17 
is a slow, gutbucket blues shuffle in A. Don’t forget to swing those eighth 
notes and remember the blues credo: You don’t have to feel bad to play the 
blues . . . but it helps.

Improvising is, at the same time, one of the easiest things to do (just find 
your notes and go) and one of the hardest (try to make up a meaningful 
melody on the spot). The more note choices you have, the more vocabulary 
you’ll be able to pull from to express your message.
 
Practice to get your fingers working smoothly through the notes up and 
down the neck. Try to surprise yourself by changing direction, skipping 
strings, and even repeating notes for dramatic effect. Some of the highest 
musical moments of your improvising career will be the results of something 
completely unintentional — a happy accident. But to have such “musical mis-
haps,” you must put yourself in harm’s way. Be bold, be daring, take chances, 
improvise.
The pentatonic scale is a great way to start making music immediately, but 
plenty of other scales exist to help you in your music making. And you still 
have to listen to other guitarists for ideas. Go outside any scale you use to 
get unusual notes, and learn passages of classic solos on recordings to see 
what makes them tick. Above all, you must develop your own sense of phras-
ing and your own voice.

R
iffs are often the most memorable component of a rock ’n’ roll song and 
can form the perfect bridge between a chord progression and a melodic 
lead phrase. Although technically a short, self-contained musical phrase, a riff 
is much, much more than that. A riff sticks in your head long after you forget 
the lyrics — and even the melody — and at a noisy party, it is the riff that 
makes a song instantly recognizable when you can’t quite make out the rest 
of the music. In many cases, the riff is the backbone of the song, its raison 
d’être (a fancy French term for mojo), and the rhythm, melody, and chords 
are all derived from the riff.
In this chapter, you venture deep into riff territory to see where rock ’n’ roll 
lives and discover why riffs themselves are such a vital and inextricable com-
ponent of rock ’n’ roll. (Hey, where do you think the phrase “a riff-roarin’ good 
time” came from?) This chapter also briefly looks at two other rock staples, 
the power chord and the double-stop. Power chords are actually easier to play 
than the open-position chords covered in Chapter 3 in Book II, and a whole 
lot easier than the dreaded barre chords also discussed in that chapter. (Oh, 
barre chords aren’t that bad, really — at least for us electric guitarists.)
Then, just when you think having any more fun in this chapter couldn’t pos-
sibly be legal, you find out how to combine riffs, power chords, and double-
stops into full-blown, fully realized rhythm figures. Rhythm figures embody 
the total approach to rhythm guitar, and virtually any strumming or single-
note technique you can come up with can be pressed into rhythm-guitar 
service and incorporated into a rhythm figure. And although lead guitar may 
be the brain surgery of the rock world — the glamorous specialty skill — 
rhythm guitar is the daily exercise and good living that keeps you healthy 
and prospering.

Book III: Rock Guitar 
Getting Your Groove On: Basic Riffs
This chapter starts off with riffs that exploit the lower register of the guitar. 
Make sure you strike only one string at a time, but that your pick strokes 
carry the same confidence and power that they have when playing chords. 
Even if the riffs sound familiar, make sure you execute the rhythms and artic-
ulations precisely as written; don’t let your ears allow you to gloss over the 
tricky parts.
Half- and whole-note riffs
A riff doesn’t have to be flashy to be memorable. Figure 4-1, in the style of the 
band Black Sabbath, uses only half notes and whole notes to create an eerie, 
menacing effect.

Track 36, 0:00
 
You can give fretted notes with long values (half notes and whole notes) 
more life by applying left-hand vibrato to them. Gently pull and release the 
string (causing it to bend slightly) very rapidly, causing the note to waver. 
Vibrato helps give slower notes more intensity. A wavy line placed above the 
note (1) tells you to apply vibrato.
Eighth- and quarter-note riffs
Other than slow riffs created from half notes and whole notes, the simplest 
riffs to play are formed from the straightforward, nonsyncopated rhythmic

units of quarter notes and eighth notes. Figures 4-2 and 4-3 are riffs that mix 
quarter notes and eighth notes. Be sure to observe the pick-stroke indica-
tions for downstrokes and upstrokes (2 and 4, respectively).

Note the presence of F# in the key signature of Figures 4-2 and 4-3. This means 
that all Fs are sharped, and that the key is either G major or E minor. So even 
though these two riffs don’t contain any Fs, we can see that the examples are 
in E minor, because the riffs gravitate to and around the root note, E.
Now try the boogie riff in Figure 4-4 (an expansion of the boogie riffs pre-
sented in Chapter 3 in Book III), which is comprised of mostly quarter notes, 
but with a couple of shuffle eighth notes thrown in to give the groove an 
extra kick. The tempo is fairly bright here, so watch that you execute the 
long-short rhythm of the shuffle eighth notes correctly.

Riffs that consist of all eighth notes create a sense of continuous motion 
and can really help propel a song along. Figure 4-5 is in all eighth notes, and 
notice how easily the end of the measure leads into the beginning of the 
second measure, creating a seamless sound. Note too the presence of the B% 
and D# — two chromatic, or out of key, notes in E minor.

Track 36, 0:37
While Figure 4-5 is a simple one-bar riff that repeats over and over, Figure 
4-6 is a longer, steady eighth-note phrase that goes for two measures before 
repeating.
 
Because riffs are short and self-contained, they can be easily looped, or 
repeated back to back with no break. All the riffs in this chapter can be 
played seamlessly, and you’re encouraged to play multiple repetitions until 
you execute the notes flawlessly — both from a technical standpoint (no 
missed or fluffed notes, no buzzing) as well as a rhythmic one. Pay particular 
attention when rounding the corner (going from the end of the riff back to the 
beginning). The barrier preventing a smooth transition can be more psycho-
logical than technical.

It’s one thing to maintain a steady, consistent delivery for two bars. It’s quite 
another to stay solid over bars upon bars or minutes upon minutes of playing 
the same riff within a groove. So repeat the riffs in this chapter in a loop fash-
ion; that is, play them numerous times until you’re sure you’ve got the long-
term as well as the short-term consistency considerations under control. Or 
at least repeat the riffs until you can’t stand it anymore. Either way, it’s good 
training for playing with any band claiming the Allman Brothers, the Grateful 
Dead, or Phish as an influence.
16th-note riffs
A 16th-note riff doesn’t have to be fast or syncopated (for more on syncopa-
tion, see Chapter 4 in Book II) just because it contains 16th notes. Figure 4-7 
is a riff that builds up speed by going first through quarter notes, then eighth 
notes, then 16ths. Does this riff sound familiar?

Many hard rock and heavy metal riffs are based in 16th notes, including the 
infamous “gallop” pattern. Figure 4-8 is a gallop riff that takes you on a wild 
ride. Buckle up — or should that be saddle up?

gone fast, such as the hard-rock groove in Figure 4-9. Be sure to observe the 
alternate-picking indications in this example.

Eighth-note syncopation
 
Technically, playing a syncopated riff is no harder than playing a nonsyncopated 
riff; it’s just trickier to read in printed music. The more experience you have 
with syncopation, the more you can learn to recognize typical syncopation 

219
 Chapter 4: Groovin’ on Riffs
Book III
Rock 
Guitar
patterns. So you don’t have to count your brains out with every dot and tie 
that appears, you can use your memory to help you. Syncopation is not inten-
tionally designed to trip you up (although it may seem like that at first); it’s 
there to put a kick into the music. Learn a few patterns and combinations, 
and you’ll start to recognize them when they reappear. Memorizing a vocabu-
lary of pre-existing syncopation patterns helps so you don’t have to reinvent 
the wheel every time you encounter a syncopated rhythm.
A great example of eighth-note syncopation occurs in the first line of the 
Beatles song “Eleanor Rigby.” If you tap your hand or foot in time and sing, 
or say in rhythm, the words “Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church 
where a wedding has been,” you notice that the words “Rigby,” “rice,” 
“church,” “wedding,” and “been” all fall on the offbeat.
Figure 4-10 is a steady eighth-note figure where only the last eighth note in 
the bar is syncopated — here, through the use of a tie that binds it to the first 
note of the next measure. This particular syncopation device is called an 
anticipation, because it anticipates the downbeat, or first — and strongest — 
beat, of the measure. In fact, an anticipation is such a common and cool-
sounding syncopation device that often players will introduce it, even when 
it’s not written into the music. It’s one of those rock ’n’ roll situations where 
something can be justified simply because “it’s a feel thing.”
 
Figure 4-10: 
Beat 1 is 
tied over 
from beat 
four-and-a-
half.
 
Track 36, 1:33
Now, double your syncopation efforts and put anticipations before beat 3 
(the beginning of the second half of the bar) as well as beat 1, in Figure 4-11.
The melody to the Beatles’ “Eleanor Rigby” is highly syncopated. In the same 
scheme as used in Figure 4-11, beats 1 and 3 are anticipated throughout the 
verse section.

Finally, Figure 4-12 is an ultra-syncopated figure where none of the notes in bar 
2 fall on the beat; they all fall in between. The band Deep Purple wrote the riff 
to their classic hit, “Smoke on the Water,” using a similar syncopation scheme.

Playing Two Notes Can Be Better 
than One: Double-Stops
Stuck in a categorical netherworld between single notes and power chords is 
the two-note phenomenon known as the double-stop. A double-stop is simply 
two notes played simultaneously — on adjacent strings or separated by one 
to four (the maximum) strings in between.

221
 Chapter 4: Groovin’ on Riffs
Book III
Rock 
Guitar
Because it’s obviously not a single note, and because a chord requires at 
least three notes, the double-stop wanders between the two camps like some 
musical double agent — sometimes masquerading as a chord, sometimes 
exhibiting single-note properties. As such, it’s a tremendously useful tool in 
rhythm guitar playing. Because of its facile properties, you can use it for lead 
playing, too (which is covered in Chapter 3 in Book III).
Right now, though, you’re going to employ double-stops in a rhythm context. 
A two-note power chord is technically a double-stop, because it’s two strings 
played together. But conceptually, guitarists don’t really think of power 
chords as double-stops. Figure 4-13 is more of a true double-stop, especially 
in its usage here. Note how its movement — between the fretted and open 
strings — is much easier to execute and less clunky than, say, switching 
between two chords (such as A and G) in the same tempo. Yet the double-
stop movement still retains a chord-like sound and feel.
 
Figure 4-13: 
A moving 
double-stop 
figure, used 
as a chordal 
device.
 
Track 37, 0:00
Note that you’ve crept up, register-wise on the guitar. You’re now not playing 
just low notes, but have moved to the midrange of open position.
Figure 4-14 is a chord progression based on A, D, and E minor, but the ascending 
double-stop movement lends a nice melodic, quasi-single-line feel to the pas-
sage. In this case, the double-stops aren’t on adjacent strings, as in Figure 4-13. 
Here, they have a string separating them (the open 3rd string, G), so you have 
to “pinch” the 2nd and 4th strings with your right-hand middle finger, or, if you 
want to employ a little fingerstyle action, the middle or index finger and thumb.

222
Book III: Rock Guitar 
 
Figure 4-14: 
A double-
stop figure

cent strings.
 
 
Track 37, 0:13
 
If you accidentally let the middle string (the open G) ring while playing Figure 
4-14, you notice it doesn’t sound half bad. So try playing the open G string 
intentionally, either by plucking all three strings, or by strumming the three 
interior strings (4th, 3rd, and 2nd) with your pick. The unchanging bass note 
(the open A string) sounded against changing ones (in this case the ascend-
ing double-stops) is called a pedal tone, or just a pedal, in music. Usually a 
pedal is the bass note, less often it’s the highest note, but sometimes it’s in 
the middle.
Combining Single-Note Riffs and Chords
Whereas lead guitar is a studied craft with an established orthodoxy (that is, 
you can buy books on the subject), rhythm guitar is a universe without many 
rules. No one can say for sure what makes up a good rhythm guitar part, but 
you sure know one when you hear it. The best rhythm players in rock — such 
as Pete Townshend, U2’s The Edge, Andy Summers, Peter Buck, Neil Young, 
and Keith Richards, just to name a few — all play in styles that are hard to 
label or analyze. But part of that indefinable magic comes from the fact that 
these guitarists don’t limit themselves to just chords when playing rhythm 
guitar. They mix a healthy dose of single notes into their playing.
Although he was known for his fiery leads and stage antics (such as play-
ing with his teeth and lighting his guitar on fire), Jimi Hendrix was a superb 
rhythm player. In his ballads, notably “Little Wing” and “The Wind Cries 
Mary,” Hendrix plays lovely Curtis Mayfield–inspired R&B chords that sound 
like a cross between gospel, country, and piano figures. Hendrix also played 
his share of double-stops, too.
Figure 4-15 is a hard rock progression that mixes power chords, open posi-
tion chords, and single notes into one cohesive part. Note how it builds up 
dramatic power by starting slow and becoming increasingly active.

The squiggly vertical lines in bar 2 of Figure 4-15 tell you to draw the pick across 
the string in a quick arpeggio, creating a kerrrang sound. Experiment to see just 
how long you can drag out the strums without losing the sense of the rhythm.
Discovering Your Own Style
Don’t be discouraged if you can’t make the riffs you see written in the nota-
tion sound exactly like what you hear on the CD. As long as you can play the 

224
Book III: Rock Guitar 
correct pitches in the specified rhythm, you’re doing fine. You have to find 
your own style. That’s why even though Mozart wrote a piano sonata one 
way, there are as many interpretations for that written piece as there are 
musicians playing it. The same is true for rhythm guitar. Each guitarist will 
play a 12-bar blues, or a power-chord sequence, or a double-stop figure in a 
slightly different way. But as long as that individual guitarist believes in what 
he is doing, each rendition will be unique, honest, and heartfelt.
 
Don’t forget to use a metronome if you get confused by any rhythm you’re play-
ing on guitar. But the most important thing when tackling these — or any — 
rhythm figures is to develop a natural feel for them. A natural, comfortable, and 
confident delivery in rhythm guitar playing is vitally important — more impor-
tant even than in lead playing. So repeat these exercises till you know them 
cold, till you own them, and then relax and play them like it ain’t no thang.

T
o sound like a true rock ’n’ roller and to share the stratospheric heights 
frequented by the legions of wailing guitar heroes, you must learn to play 
up the neck — that is, the frets closest to the body of the guitar. We take you 
up the neck in Chapter 3 in Book III, which introduces the pentatonic scale, 
but in this chapter, you go beyond that and find out how to think up the neck.
Playing up the neck requires both a theoretical approach and a technical 
adjustment. In fact, it’s probably a little harder on the brain (at least at first) 
to figure out what to play than it is for the fingers to fall in line. Those smart-
alecky digits, which acclimate very quickly, just prove the old saying, “the 
flesh is willing but the spirit is weak.” Or something like that.
Rock players play up the neck a lot — a whole lot. Many rock players play 
way, way up the neck, higher than any folk-based music would dare venture, 
and beyond the range of many jazz players. In many folk-based and singer-
songwriter-type songs, you often don’t have to play beyond open position at 
all. Or if you do, it’s just to grab the occasional oddball, up-the-neck chord.
In rock, however, playing up the neck is essential, especially for lead playing. 
Playing up the neck not only gives you access to the higher-pitched and more 
brilliant-sounding notes, but also allows you to play the same notes many 
different ways. Barre chords (see Chapter 3 in Book II) also allow you to use 
chords of the same name but which appear in different parts of the neck (all 
of them “up” from open position). When you add barre chords you then have 
a complete picture of what it’s like to play using the entire neck of the guitar. 
And to suddenly glimpse what it’s like to have a command of the entire fret-
board is a very exciting and empowering feeling.

226
Part III: Rock Guitar 
Beyond Open Position: 
Going Up the Neck
You are now leaving the relatively safe haven of open position for the great 
unknown — that vast uncharted sea of wire and wood they call (cue dra-
matic music) . . . the upper frets! It’s time to unbolt those training wheels, cut 
the apron strings, loose the surly bonds of earthbound music, and fly high. 
You’re going up into the wild blue yonder.
Playing up the neck opens up a whole new world of possibilities for playing 
rock guitar music. If you know only one way to play an A chord — or to play 
a riff one way when you hear an A chord — then all of your music will have a 
certain sameness about it.
But if you have the entire neck at your disposal, are able to play A chords in 
several different places, can form lead lines in four or five places, and have 
opinions and associations on what effect you’ll produce when you choose 
one over the other, then you’re tapping the true potential of the possibilities 
the guitar neck has to offer.
 
When playing up the neck, you really need to keep an eye on what your left 
hand is doing, unlike playing chords and riffs in open position where you 
really don’t need to (or shouldn’t have to) keep an eye on your left hand. So 
get used to keeping your head cocked to the left (if you’re right-handed) and 
really looking at — and learning the locations of — those fret markers (the 
dots or other decorative inlays on the side of the neck and sunk into the fin-
gerboard). They’ll be your signposts in your up-the-neck journeys.
Choking up on the neck
The best way to get moving up the neck is to start out with an exercise that 
doesn’t introduce any new or intimidating techniques, either chordal or 
melodic. You’re just going to get your left hand moving around the neck a 
little. So you start with some known chord forms that you can move up and 
down to good musical effect over an open-D-string pedal (see the explanation 
of pedal tone in Chapter 4 in Book III).
Figure 5-1 is a rhythm figure that pits an open D string against some chord 
forms that move up and down the neck. Notice that forms themselves are the 
familiar D, Dm, Dm7, and D7 shapes. But they move around the frets, rather 
than staying in one place, as they do when they’re just doing “D” duty in open 
position. Be sure you observe carefully the fret-number indications in the 
diagrams.

Conveniently, you can refer to these forms by their open-position shapes: D, 
Dm, Dm7, and D7. But these forms don’t necessarily sound like those chords, 
because they’ve been moved or transposed. When they’re moved out of their 
original, open position, they now produce a different-sounding chord. When 
discussing chord forms, be aware of the difference between a D shape versus a 
D chord. A D shape played at the 7th position actually sounds like a G chord — 
for the very good reason that it is a G chord. You can play many different forms 
to create a given chord, so chords are named by their absolute sound — their 
musical result — not the shape used to create them.
Playing double-stops on the move
Now move to the interior of the guitar’s strings and play a rhythm figure com-
prised of moving double-stops on adjacent strings. Figure 5-2 is a hard-rock 
figure that creates drama by moving a series of melodic-oriented double-
stops up and down two strings, the 3rd and the 4th, over an open-A pedal. 
This is a great exercise to get your eyes and left hand used to playing the up-
the-neck frets accurately.
 
Because Figure 5-2 creates an interplay between the open A string and the 
moving double-stops, try increasing that sense of delineation by applying 
palm mutes (see Chapter 4 in Book II for an explanation of palm mutes) to the 
open A string and accents to the fretted double-stop notes. You can hear this 
effect on the CD performance.

After you’ve gotten a feel for what it’s like to move around the neck, you can 
see that not only won’t you get hurt, but also it’s kind of cool to do. The next 
section shows some movable lead patterns that will get you sounding and 
thinking like a pro in no time.
Playing Closed-Position Lead Patterns
Playing in closed position means that you employ no open strings to play 
your chords, melodies, or riffs. That may seem like a restriction, but it actu-
ally frees you from the tyranny of open position, allowing you to transpose 
instantly and easily. But getting comfortable playing all fretted strings takes a 
bit of an adjustment.
The first lesson about playing up the neck is that you can no longer rely on 
your dear friends, the open strings. When you first learn the guitar, the open 
strings are like spin doctors to your politically incorrect blunders: They can 
shield your most embarrassing gaffes by running sonic interference. The 
open strings will ring through clearly while your fingers struggle with a tough 
chord change, muffling and buzzing their way to coherence.
But in up-the-neck playing, if you relax your left hand — even for the briefest 
moment — the sound disappears. So you have to be really sensitive to what’s 
happening on both sides of the notes, the attack as well as the cut-off — the

point your finger leaves the current fret to go do something else. And without 
the benefit of open strings, you have to actively work to get the notes to con-
nect to each other smoothly. You do that by employing legato.
Letting notes ring for their full term is called playing legato, and after guitar-
ists no longer have ringing strings to provide the sonic glue, achieving legato 
turns from a passive let-it-just-happen affair into a concerted effort.
 
So as you begin playing up the neck, in closed position, keep an ear out for 
making the notes ring for their full value. Don’t let a note stop ringing until 
it’s time for the new note to take over. Often that’s as simple as leaving full 
pressure on your finger before releasing it at the last possible moment to 
play a new note on the same string (if the next note is lower), or placing an 
additional finger down on the same string (if the next note is higher). We call 
this the “lazy-finger approach” — where a finger doesn’t move — or release 
pressure — until it absolutely has to. So you are hereby granted permission 
to be “digitally lethargic” and practice the lazy-finger approach to develop a 
legato technique on closed, or fretted, strings.
Learning to play patterns that employ no open strings has big-time benefits. 
Playing all-fretted patterns presents a clear advantage in one respect: The 
pattern can be transposed easily.
Playing in Position
So you don’t just go tearing up the neck willy-nilly, you need to know some 
zones, or positions, to give your up-the-neck forays some purpose. Guitarists 
don’t just go up the neck because it’s higher up there (although that’s 
sometimes a desired result — to produce higher-pitched notes); they do so 
because a certain position gives them better access to the notes or figures 
they want to play. Going to a certain zone on the neck to better facilitate play-
ing in a given key is called playing in position.
Positions defined
A position is defined as the lowest-numbered fret the left-hand index finger 
plays in a given passage. So to play in 5th position, place your left hand so 
the index finger can comfortably fret the 5th fret on any string. If your hand 
is relaxed and the ball-side of the ridge of knuckles on your left-hand palm 
is resting near the neck, parallel to it, your remaining fingers — the middle, 
ring, and little — should be able to fret comfortably the 6th, 7th, and 8th 
frets, respectively. Figure 5-3 shows a neck diagram outlining the available 
notes of the pentatonic scale in 5th position.

A firm position
Now that you have the answer to what playing in position means, the next 
question is what specific benefits playing in position brings — other than 
allowing you access to higher-pitched notes not available in open position? 
The answer is that certain positions favor certain keys, scales, figures, or 
styles, better than other positions do. Here are the three most common cri-
teria for determining the best position in which to play a given passage of 
music:
 
 Key: The chief way to determine at what position to play a certain piece 
of music is by its key. To use the example in Figures 5-3 and 5-4, 5th posi-
tion favors very much the major keys of C and F. If you have melodic 
material in the key of C or F, you’d be well advised to first try playing it 
in 5th position. Chances are, you’d find the notes fall easily and naturally 
under your fingers. The relative minors of C and F, A minor and D minor, 
also fall very comfortably in 5th position. This is no accident, because 
these minor keys share the same key signature, which means they use 
exactly the same pitch class (a term you learn in music school for col-
lection of notes, not necessarily in any given order) as their major-key 
counterparts.
 
 The pitch class of the C major and A minor pentatonic scale is A C D E G. 
The order of the notes changes depending on the context. For example, 
in the key of C, where the root is C, the notes read C D E G A. In A minor, 
A is the root, so the notes are ordered as A C D E G. After you start to 
play, however, the order becomes less important than the collection of 
notes (which is exactly the same for both keys), because life would be 
pretty boring if music was played in order of the notes in the scale or 
key from which they were derived.
 
 From a scale: A scale can be derived from a key, but often the scale you 
want isn’t extracted from a traditional major or minor key. For example, 
the blues scale is one of the most useful scales in rock, but it’s not 
pulled from an existing major or minor key. So C blues is better played 
out of 8th position, not 5th.
 
 From a chord: Sometimes you may not care anything about scales or 
keys because you find a chord whose sound you can manipulate by 
pressing down additional fingers or lifting up existing fingers to create a 

231
 Chapter 5: Playing Up the Neck

Guitar
cool chord move. The technical term for this is a cool chord move, and 
often the movement doesn’t involve melodic or scalar movement, just a 
neat way to move your fingers that results in a nice sound. Rock guitar 
moves are often discovered and adopted simply because they feel com-
fortable to perform or involve satisfying a natural impulse.
Using the Movable Pentatonic Scale
Probably the greatest invention ever created for lead rock guitarists is the 
pentatonic scale, to which we pay homage in Chapter 3 in Book III. Its con-
struction and theory have spawned countless theoretical discussions, but 
for rock guitar purposes, it just sounds good, and you’re going to focus your 
efforts on figuring out as many ways to use it as possible. The following sec-
tions focus on moving it around the neck at will, changing the fingering to 
fit all sorts of different positions. And you can do this while maintaining the 
same notes in the same key.
Staying at home position
The main position for the pentatonic scale is placed in 5th position. This is 
the home position of the pentatonic scale in C major or A minor. For simplici-
ty’s sake, one scale, A minor, is used in the pentatonic studies for the remain-
der of this chapter. But be aware that most of the same qualities discussed 
can be applied to C major as well. Figure 5-4 is the A minor pentatonic scale 
in 5th position.
 
Figure 5-4: 
The A minor 
pentatonic 
scale in its 
home, or 
5th, position.
 
Although this scale looks to be positioned fairly high up the neck, only two of 
its notes — the 8th-fret C and 5th-fret A, both on the 1st string — are out of 
range in open position. The rest of the pitches can be found in other places in 
open position. For example, the 8th fret on the 2nd string is a G, which is the 
same G as the 1st string, 3rd fret — a note that’s easily played in open posi-
tion. So as you step through these notes in 5th position, be aware that you 
can play almost all of those same pitches in an open-position location as well.

232
Part III: Rock Guitar 
The next step is to learn the various ways to play the same scale but in a 
different position, starting on a different note. This is known in music as an 
inversion. An inversion of something (a scale, a chord) is a different ordering 
of the same elements.
Going above home position
After the home position, you may feel restless and yearn to break out of the 
box. To extend your reach, learn the pentatonic scale in the position immedi-
ately above the home position. Figure 5-5 is a map of the A minor pentatonic 
scale in 7th position.
 
Figure 5-5: 
Notes of 
the A minor 
pentatonic 
scale in 7th 
position.
 
 
These are exactly the same notes (except the highest note, the 1st string, 
9th fret, which is out of the home position’s range) as those found in 5th 
position.
Dropping below home position
To apply some symmetry in your life, learn the pentatonic scale form immedi-
ately below the home position. Figure 5-6 shows the scale form immediately 
below the home position. It’s played out of 2nd position and has one note on 
the bottom that the 5th position doesn’t have, the low G on the 6th string, 
3rd fret.
Take a moment and see what you’ve accomplished so far. You can now play 
one scale, the A minor pentatonic, in three different positions: 2nd, 5th (the 
home position), and 7th. If you look at the neck diagram with all three pat-
terns superimposed on the frets, it looks like Figure 5-7. It’s presented in 
two ways: as three separate but interlocking patterns (triangles, dots, and 
squares), and the union of those patterns, the actual notes available (as just 
dots).

Note how the patterns dovetail, or overlap: The bottom of the 5th position 
acts as the top of the 2nd position, and the top of the 5th position acts as the 
bottom of the 7th position. It’s like Paul Simon once said: “One man’s ceiling 
is another man’s floor.”
Moving between positions
Okay, you’ve seen the way to play a given pentatonic scale in three positions. 
Now it’s time to put these patterns into motion by actually moving between 
them. This way you not only get to travel laterally, across the neck, but longi-
tudinally, up and down the neck. Can you stand it?

234
Part III: Rock Guitar 
The shift
Figure 5-8 shows two simple melodic segments that go from 2nd position to 
5th position and 5th position to 7th position via a shift. To perform a shift, 
slide your left-hand finger from one fret to another above or below it, main-
taining contact with the string. In the first segment, Figure 5-8a shifts up from 
the 5th fret to the 7th fret on the third finger of the left hand, hitching a ride 
on the 5th string. Shifting this way takes you from 2nd position to 5th posi-
tion. In Figure 5-8b, slide up on the little finger.

Sometimes the finger you slide up with isn’t the proper finger for that fret 
and string in the new position. But you can usually correct it easily enough 
on a subsequent move.
The slide, reach, and jump
A slide is one of two ways to shift positions while playing. A reach is the 
other. When you reach, either upward or downward, you stretch your hand 
out so a left-hand finger can play a note out of position. You can always jump 
or leap, too, which just means that you don’t leave any fingers down, or main-
tain any contact with the old position. Mostly, you just do whatever works.
Lateral versus longitudinal
Figure 5-9 is an example of an ascending melodic line that illustrates the dif-
ference between playing laterally versus longitudinally. The first ascending 
and descending sequence takes you across the fingerboard in a stationary 
position. Then on the second ascent, the line shifts to reach the upper notes, 
rather than playing to the upper strings on the same position. You have to 
play this one up to tempo to hear how the same pitches sound when played 
in two different places.

Seeking Out the Five Positions 
of the Pentatonic Scale
Figure 5-10, for your amazement, lays out on one long neck diagram the five 
positions of the pentatonic scale. Although Figure 5-10 maps out the notes to 
only one key and its relative minor, you can fit this pattern to all 12 keys — 
and their relative majors or minors — simply by moving it up or down to the 
appropriate fret (for example, up three frets for E%, down four frets to A%, and 
so forth).

Part III: Rock Guitar 
Almost as important, each of these patterns has an associated chord form. 
For example, the home position corresponds to an open position G chord. 
The scale just below the home position looks like an A chord. The position 
immediately above the home position is based on an E chord. The appropri-
ate chords are also shown in Figure 5-10 relative to their corresponding scale 
forms.
You can begin to see how the many frets of the guitar neck begin to become 
demystified. This one scale occupies so many different positions on the neck. 
And this is only one scale, in one key, with only five notes. The shapes used 
to plot the notes help you to differentiate visually among the patterns.
With five positions of the same scale at your disposal, try Figure 5-11, which 
is a melody based on the pentatonic scale and can be played in all five posi-
tions. The rests separating the phrases should give you ample time to switch 
to the new position.

Changing Your Position
What’s cool about playing up the neck is how often you get to shift posi-
tions while doing it. And make no mistake, shifting is cool. You get to move 
your whole hand instead of just your fingers. That looks really good on TV.
Now that you’ve gone from one pentatonic scale position to another via a 
shift, you’re ready to try some real licks. These licks aren’t limited to notes 
drawn from the pentatonic scale, as previous figures in the chapter were. 
Going forward, you’re allowed the luxury of some chromatic (out of key) addi-
tions. You’re playing real music now! Anything goes.
Licks that transport
Just like life, a lick can start you out in one location and take you to another 
unexpected place — often with delightful results. Figure 5-12 begins in 5th 
position, but quickly shoots up to 7th and finishes in 8th position with a 
bluesy flourish. The added chromatic note here is the flat five in A minor, E%, 
which is called a blue note (so named because it’s the note that creates a sad 
or blue sound). The left-hand fingering indications will help you to play this 
smoothly.
Chord licks, lead licks
In rock, a lick is a short, self-contained melodic 
phrase. This may sound suspiciously close to 
the definition of a riff, but there is a slight dif-
ference. While “riff” and “lick” are often used 
interchangeably, most guitarists agree that a riff 
is a repeated figure that can be used to form the 
basis of a song, while a lick is more of a melodic 
snippet, fleeting in nature, and is not generally 
used to form the basis of a rhythm figure.
Like riffs, licks are usually single-note affairs. 
But sometimes a lick can be chord based. If 
the distinction between a riff and a lick is a 
little fuzzy on the single-note front, it’s even 
more obscure when dealing with chords. In 
other words, there’s not much difference from 
a chord-based riff and a chord-based lick. It’s 
sort of like distinguishing between good tequila 
and bad tequila: It’s hard to do because the 
best tequila you’ve ever had in your life doesn’t 
taste a whole lot different than the worst tequila 
you’ve ever had in your life.
Nevertheless, in an effort to pigeonhole, clas-
sify, and label all things musical, some famous 
chord-based licks throughout the history of 
rock ’n’ roll include the Doobie Brothers’ “Listen 
to the Music” and “Long Train Running,” Jimi 
Hendrix’s “Hey Joe,” “The Wind Cries Mary,” 
and “Little Wing,” and Led Zeppelin’s “Stairway 
to Heaven” (the section right before the line 
“Ooh, and it makes me wonder”).

Adding E% to the A minor pentatonic scale creates a six-note scale called the 
blues scale. The blues scale in that case is spelled A C D E% E G. The numeric 
formula (the “interval recipe,” if you will) for the blues scale is 1 %3 4 %5 5 %7. 
The %5 can also be written as a #4, the %5’s enharmonic equivalent. So, apply-
ing this formula to a C major scale (C D E F G A B) produces C E% F G% G B%, the 
C blues scale. (See Book IV for a whole lot more on the blues.)
Of course, you can start high and end low — which might be bad in the world 
of finance or investments but is perfectly fine in music. Figure 5-13 is a lick 
that begins in 5th position and takes an unexpected dip into 2nd position for 
some low-end gravity.

From the depths to the heights
For the ultimate exercise in shifting, try Figure 5-14, which starts in 2nd 
position, goes through 5th position, then 7th, and finally winds up in 9th — 
ending on a high, 12th-fret E on the 1st string. This allows you to “end on a 
high note” (albeit through low humor).

Although you’ve practiced different positions, various ways to shift, and 
five versions of the pentatonic scale, you’ve never left the key of C major/A 
minor.
Knowing Where to Play
After you get your hand moving comfortably around the neck, and you have 
a solid foundation in the A minor pentatonic scale and its different positions, 
try playing the pentatonic scale in its various forms in different keys. To do 
that, you must know how to place the scale patterns on the different regions 
of the neck.
Associating keys with positions
Some keys just fall more comfortably in certain positions than in others, 
so this section starts with the obvious, default positions for three common 
keys. Remember, any pentatonic scale satisfies two (related) keys: a major 
and its relative minor, or a minor and its relative major, depending on your 
orientation.
G positions
The home position for G major falls in open position or 12th position (which 
is exactly an octave higher). Because these are two extremes of the neck (and 
the open-position version defeats the purpose of this exercise), you might 
try to play G-based stuff out of 7th position. Figure 5-15 is a riff in 7th-position 
G major pentatonic (with one out-of-key note, the A% in bar 1), and its corre-
sponding neck diagram.

F positions
F is a common key for blues, especially if you jam with horn players. Figure 
5-16 is a bluesy riff in F major, with an added flat 3, A%. This riff sits well in 
7th-position F major pentatonic. Note that because F is one whole step down 
from G, its five pentatonic scale positions are the same as the key of G, but 
shifted down two frets.

Note that even though this lick is in 7th position, it’s in F, not G, and so uses a 
different pentatonic scale form than the 7th-position form designated for G or 
E minor.
F minor positions
The key of F minor (and its relative major, A%) is the interval of a major 3rd 
(four frets) lower than our dearly beloved A minor, so all of its pentatonic 
scale positions are shifted down four frets, relative to A minor. Its home

position falls in 1st position, which means all subsequent positions are up 
from that. So even though the A minor example had a position lower than 
the home position, in the F minor example, that lower position gets “rotated” 
up the neck to the 10th position. Figure 5-17 is an earthy minor riff that takes 
advantage of its low position on the neck — the lowest possible closed-
position pentatonic scale.

Placing positions
One great advantage to the guitar is that after you learn one pattern, in any 
key, you can instantly adapt it to any other key without much thought at all. 
Unlike piano players, flute players, and trombonists — who have to trans-
pose, remember key signatures, and create different fingerings to play the 
same phrase in another key — guitarists just have to shift their left hand up 
or down the neck a few frets. But the pattern — what you actually play — 
remains the same.
It’s as if you wanted to learn a foreign language, but instead of learning new 
words for all the nouns and verbs you know in English, you simply had to 
raise or lower your voice. Speak in a high, squeaky voice, and you’re talking 
French. Say the same words in a deep, booming voice and you’re conversing 
in Chinese. That’s what transposing is like for the guitarist.
To help you know which positions are good for which keys, look at the table 
in Figure 5-18. This table is by no means exhaustive and by no means the 
final word on where to place your pentatonic positions. It merely gives you 
a jumping off point to know in what general vicinity to put your hands to 
improvise in, say, the key of A%.

Putting the five positions into play
 
After you learn the pentatonic scale in five positions, you are more than 90 
percent there, technically. The next hurdle is more mental than anything 
else. You simply have to be able to calculate where to play any given key, 
and which pentatonic pattern best suits your mood. Here are some exer-
cises you can do to limber up your brain, learn the fretboard, and become 
acquainted with the differing characteristics offered by each of the five 
pentatonic positions:
 
 Work out in different keys, spot transpose: Don’t just always play in A 
minor and C. Jam along to the radio, which often has strange (at least for 
guitarists) keys.
 
 Arpeggiate the chords you’re playing over: Remember from Figure 5-10 
that all these scale positions have associated chord forms. Try arpeggi-
ating (playing one at a time) the notes of the chord whenever that chord 
comes up in the progression. This is a great way to break up linear play-
ing, and it forces you to think of the notes of the chord, rather than play-
ing memorized patterns.
 
 Work out in different positions: It’s one thing to work out in different 
keys. It’s another to work out in different positions. Make sure that you 
mix it up with respect to positions as well as keys.
We’re all human and we tend to favor routines and tread familiar ground. 
With pentatonic scale patterns, the comfort zone lies in the home position 
and the ones immediately above and below. Make an effort to treat all the 
positions equally, however, so you can breeze through an ascending or 
descending line without hesitating as to where the correct notes are.
If you work to become fluid in all keys, all positions, and all patterns, the neck 
becomes your musical magic carpet and can transport you effortlessly to 
magical lands.
 
The fret markers on the neck are not just there to look pretty. They make it 
easier to find positions up the neck. Use them!

R
ock ’n’ roll was created from a hybrid of styles that included traditional 
blues, country and western, rhythm and blues (R&B), and mainstream 
popular music. Many rock pioneers, such as the Beatles, claim to have been 
influenced by the older blues players, yet their music was sunny, pop-ish, 
and of the stuff that made teenage girls giggle, scream, and faint. No prison 
chain-gang song, field holler, or other traditional blues form could do that. So 
clearly something else was going on.
Early rock songs clearly showed their roots, because a “universal rock style” 
hadn’t yet developed. Like immigrants meeting in a new land, everyone was 
there to pursue a common purpose, build a common community, and speak 
a common language, but they all still carried with them habits and dialects 
of the Old Country from which they came. Buddy Holly and Elvis had clear 
southern roots (Texas and Memphis, respectively), and Chuck Berry and Bo 
Diddley were definitely a product of more northern climes (Chicago’s Chess 
Records). Yet all were learning from each other, while converting listeners 
who heard them and influencing every guitarist who followed them. This 
early era in rock ’n’ roll was a musical melting pot of styles.
Those styles led to an explosion of rock “genres” over the next half century, 
led by a procession of rock guitar gods. To try to cover just the best legends 
would easily take up several books. In this chapter, you get merely a taste of 
those musicians whose playing added significantly to rock guitar history.

Book III: Rock Guitar 
Bo Diddley
One of the biggest influences in rock was rhythm and blues (or R&B), which 
would continue to develop on its own (see Book IV), but also had a profound 
effect on rock ’n’ roll. Some performers, such as pianist/vocalist Fats Domino, 
weren’t really rock musicians, but enjoyed mainstream success because 
radio playlists and record-sales charts hadn’t distinguished between the two 
genres yet.
However, one of the biggest influences in bringing the R&B sound mainstream 
was the late Bo Diddley. Born Ellas McDaniel in McComb, Mississippi, Diddley 
grew up in Chicago, where he moved to at age 5. He was a self-invented phe-
nomenon who played a homemade, rectangular-shaped guitar with his teeth 
and behind his back, brandishing it in a sexually suggestive manner — all tech-
niques that would be brought to high art by Jimi Hendrix. One of Diddley’s 
best-known songs was an anthem he composed for himself, named after him-
self, and which used a syncopated rhythm that became synonymous with his 
name. That must be some kind of record: a person, song, and a rhythm, all 
having the same name.
Figure 6-1 is a rhythm passage that employs the “Bo Diddley Beat.” Note how 
“scratchy” it is, and how the left-hand mutes are actually written as X-shaped 
noteheads in the notation. Above the music are rhythm slashes, which show 
what the rhythm section does to accompany the guitar figure below it.

Everyone knows Lubbock-born Buddy Holly because of his unique status in 
rock ’n’ roll history: He was part of the trio of rock performers (along with 
Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper) that went down in the tragic plane crash in 
1959 (immortalized in Don McLean’s song “American Pie” as “the day the music 
died”). He also composed and sang some memorable songs, including “That’ll 
Be the Day,” “Not Fade Away,” “Every Day,” and “Peggy Sue.” Holly made a last-
ing contribution to rock guitar, however, in addition to achieving mythic status 
as a rock martyr: He was one of the first to popularize the Fender Stratocaster; 
he played, wrote, and recorded his own music with his own band (being one of 
the first to use multi-tracking in the studio to enhance his performances); and 
he played the featured guitar himself. All while wearing thick-framed glasses.
Figure 6-2 shows a blues turnaround with a distinctly Holly-like treatment, fol-
lowed by a boldly strummed chordal statement.

Chuck Berry
More than any other guitarist, Chuck Berry defines the single point at which 
rock ’n’ roll guitar became a bona fide style. And he is considered a real 
innovator, a true hero, rubbing shoulders with the ranks of Eric Clapton, Jimi 
Hendrix, and Eddie Van Halen. Berry had down cold the entire ethos of rock 
’n’ roll: the rhythm, the lead, the attitude, the lyrical double-entendre, and 
the moves (his famous “duck walk”). And he did it many years before any of 
these guitar heroes were on the scene, between 1957 and 1960.
Figure 6-3 is the familiar-sounding rhythm figure, which owes its signature 
sound to the movement of the chord’s 5th degree momentarily up to the 6th 
degree, and then resolving back to the 5th. You can play the 5-to-6 movement 
on the I, IV, and V chords (for example A, D, and E), and in either a straight-
eighth or shuffle feel. (See Chapter 4 in Book VII for more on the I, IV, and V

chords in relation to music theory.) It’s a stationary, one-note adaptation of 
the boogie-woogie line played by R&B pianists and bass players. Chuck Berry 
didn’t invent it, but he sure made it popular, and it’s often referred to in vari-
ous appellations using his name.

Hold your left-hand first and third fingers stationary while reaching up with 
your fourth finger to momentarily fret the 6th degree of the chord. Be careful 
not to shift the already-fretted fingers as you fret and release the fourth finger.
John Lennon and George Harrison
The so-called British Invasion was a clever catch phrase and headline dreamed 
up by some savvy media type to describe the flood of British rock bands that 
gained popularity in the early to mid-’60s, the most famous being the Beatles 
from Liverpool. The band’s guitarists, John Lennon on rhythm and George 
Harrison on lead, really built the bridge between early rock and classic 
rock. They did straight covers and knockoffs of Chuck Berry tunes, but later 
transcended early rock and came to master just about any sub-genre they 
touched until they broke up in 1970.
The rhythm riff to the early Beatles song “I Saw Her Standing There” is highly 
twangy and percussive-sounding. You just can’t get this sound out of a barre 
chord, proving that open-position chords do indeed have their place in rock. 
Figure 6-4 requires a tightly controlled rhythm guitar approach, using open-
position chords, while “keeping a lid on them” through heavy left-hand muting. 
The harder you hit the strings, the more dynamic and choppy-sounding (in a 
good way) your sound is, but the more potential it has to get out of control.

Instead of just strumming, you can use a slow pick drag — either as an up- or 
a downstroke — to draw out the notes in a quick arpeggio. You can hear this 
technique on the CD, although it’s not written into the music.
Pete Townshend
You don’t have to “carve” wailing leads to be a rock player. The Who’s Pete 
Townshend didn’t play stellar lead, for example, but he had the best rhythm 
sound in rock. He elevated rhythm guitar to a high art. And it was great the-
ater in the best rock tradition. To add emphasis or a sense of excitement, 
Townshend often threw in a quick 16th-note-strummed flourish with a quick 
down-up-down–stroked sequence in his right hand. Guitarists often describe 
this sound to each other as chick-a-CHOW (you won’t find that in any college 
music-theory book). Even quarter notes would be treated to the “windmill,” 
where Townshend would fully extend his long arm and make large sweeping 
circular motions, striking the strings as his hand passed his midsection.
Figure 6-5 shows a rhythm guitar part in the Pete Townshend style with 
plenty of dynamics and syncopations.

Keith Richards
Keith Richards is a founder and musical anchor of one of the most enduring 
and successful rock bands of all time, the Rolling Stones. He is a highly origi-
nal musician who plays chiefly rhythm guitar. The riff to “Satisfaction” (1965), 
which Richards composed, is arguably one of the most recognizable and 
classic of all time. It proved that rock didn’t have to use clever and inventive 
melodies to be effective. This riff is only three different notes having a range 
of 11/2 steps. On paper (to coin a phrase), it didn’t seem all that distinctive, 
and yet it launched a huge number-one hit and was a harbinger of the petu-
lant and rebellious future of rock. The Rolling Stones presented rock ’n’ roll 
as it was meant to be: simple, grammatically incorrect, and immortal.
Keith Richards is a human riff machine, creating memorable hooks to such 
immortal songs as “Start Me Up,” “Honky-tonk Women,” “Jumping Jack 
Flash,” “Last Time,” and “Brown Sugar.” The aforementioned songs all ben-
efited from Richards’s patented “chordal riff” approach, where the musical 
motion, interest, and impetus comes from not moving chords — nor single 
lines based on chords — but available movement within a left-hand chord 
form. Figure 6-6 is a blend of chordal riffs, played within a fairly stationary 
left-hand chord-form setting.

Eric Clapton
One of the primary forces that defined the post–British Invasion classic-rock 
era was the maturing of the electric blues style, as typified by Eric Clapton, 
Jimmy Page, and Jimi Hendrix. Many bands had readily acknowledged R&B 
and early rock greats Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley as influences, but either 
covered their material directly or ignored it completely in favor of a pop 
sound. But with the coming of age of Clapton, Page, and Hendrix, a new syn-
thesis was taking place where the electric blues was about to enjoy not only 
a renaissance, but a transformation.
Clapton got his start in the Yardbirds (as did Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page), but 
left to join John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers where he honed soulful and lyrical 
lead skills. He became a bona fide superstar of the guitar (and was the first 
“guitar god” — all over London graffiti artists scrawled “Clapton Is God”) and 
helped revive popular interest in many of the blues legends he drew inspira-
tion from, including Robert Johnson, Blind Lemmon Jefferson, Son House, 
Skip James, Elmore James, Freddie King, Buddy Guy, B.B. King, Otis Rush, 
Albert King, and many others.
Clapton earned the nickname “Slowhand” because of his supreme ease in 
playing and the effortless way he moved over the fretboard. Following his 
stint with the Bluesbreakers, he founded Cream, often credited as the first 
true supergroup comprised of recognized virtuosos. The heaviness of their 
hit songs, including “White Room,” “Sunshine of Your Love,” and “Badge,” 
helped to define the era of the “power trio” and to establish the blues as 
viable rock material, both creatively and commercially. “Crossroads,” a song 
by Robert Johnson, captured in a live version on the album Wheels of Fire 
(1968), contains one of the greatest guitar solos of all time. Eddie Van Halen 
learned it note for note and, in concert, would drop it into a song’s improvisa-
tional section as a tribute.
Figure 6-7 is a bluesy solo, employing many of the techniques Clapton used to 
infuse his solos with expression: bends, hammers, pulls, slides, and left-hand 
vibrato. Notice that much of this solo takes place comfortably in the home 
position of the pentatonic scale. This is the way Clapton plays: not with gra-
tuitous flash, but with restraint, precision, and taste.

Jimi Hendrix
Jimi Hendrix is hailed as perhaps the greatest rock guitarist of all time. He 
combined the best elements of electric blues, psychedelic abandon, sonic 
sculpting, and pure inspiration. Although he died at only 27 in 1970, his 
legacy is the most enduring and studied of any guitarist. He started off in the 
R&B circuit as a sideman, playing with the Isley Brothers and Little Richard, 
to name two, but quickly developed his own style and became a local legend 
revered for his other-worldly technique and far-out stage performances.
Hendrix was a superior showman as well as guitarist, and could play the guitar 
behind his back and with his teeth. Like Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck, Hendrix 
saw the guitar as a total sonic instrument and was a master of marshaling 
such effects as distortion, feedback (the high-pitched howl that occurs when 
you face the guitar’s pickups directly at a cranked-up amp), and the wah-wah 
pedal. Hendrix recorded three albums, Are You Experienced (1967), Axis: 
Bold As Love (1967), and Electric Ladyland (1968), containing such classics 
as “Purple Haze,” “Hey Joe,” “All Along the Watchtower,” “Little Wing,” and 
“Voodoo Child (Slight Return).” He played left-handed, using a “flipped” right-
handed guitar (usually a Strat), restrung.
Figure 6-8 is a lead figure using several techniques of which Hendrix was an 
acknowledged master: blues playing, string bending, whammy bar manipulation, 
and effects use (wah-wah pedal and distortion).

Try getting the pitches and rhythms under your fingers first, before incorpo-
rating the bar moves. Then work to make the combination of blues soloing, 
whammy bar manipulation, and effects use as cohesive as possible.
Jimmy Page
Jimmy Page was a seasoned sideman and session player, and, perhaps because 
of this, was able to drive his band Led Zeppelin into producing the ultimate in 
finely crafted songs and perfectly orchestrated instrumental parts. Although 
a virtuoso, Page never overplayed, preferring to showcase his genius through 
his composed riffs, arranging skill, and songwriting savvy. Led Zeppelin could 
seemingly take on any music form and make it work: traditional blues-based 
material (“Since I’ve Been Loving You”), Eastern-influenced music (“Kashmir”), 
folk influences (“Bron-Y-Aur Stomp”), flat-out rockers (“Whole Lotta Love,” 
“Heartbreaker”), trippy psychedelia (“Dazed and Confused”), and epic anthems 
(“Stairway to Heaven”). Many people consider Zeppelin to be the prototype for 
heavy metal.
If you had to pick one band from the entire classic rock era that encompassed 
everything — great blues-based guitar playing, immortal riffs, successfully 
eclectic material (from blues to folk to exotic to metal), and superior song-
writing, it would have to be Led Zeppelin. No other band comes close in 
defining the classic rock era.

Carlos Santana
Mexican-born Carlos Santana rose to prominence in the early 1970s, leading 
a big band that played Latin rock, but with a guitar sound so lyrical, so big, 
so mature, he became an unavoidable and irresistible influence for any other 
guitarist who heard him. Santana was equally at home playing in a flashy, 
virtuosic style as he was in a slower, more soulful one, but it was his thick, 
creamy, blues-based sound that most people associate him with. His minor-
key lines were especially achingly expressive. Through his hits “Evil Ways” 
(1970), “Black Magic Woman” (1970), and “Oye Como Va” (1971, written by 
Latin percussion great Tito Puente), Santana established himself as a true 
guitar hero along the lines of Clapton and Page.
Figure 6-10 is a lyrical, melodic line played over a Latin-rock-flavored beat. 
The progression here outlines the Dorian mode, which is like the minor scale 
but with a raised 6th degree. The quarter-note triplets (which are twice as 
long as eighth-note triplets, or three for every two beats) help lend an expres-
sive, lyrical quality to the line.

Stevie Ray Vaughan
Although primarily considered a blues guitarist and coming later than clas-
sic rock’s acknowledged heyday, the brilliant Stevie Ray Vaughan simply 
demands inclusion in any discussion about rock, because he played with as 
much exuberance and abandon as any rock player since Hendrix. He revived 
the dying blues movement in the early 1980s, after, improbably, getting his 
professional start as a sideman with the godfather of glam, David Bowie. He 
was profoundly influenced by Jimi Hendrix and often performed Hendrix’s 
famed ballad “Little Wing.” Vaughan was an inspiration to fellow-Texan and 
guitar great Eric Johnson, as well as any rock player who’s ever heard him 
and tried to fuse together the already-close sensibilities of electric blues and 
rock. He fronted his own band, playing inspired rhythm as well as lead, and 
was at the height of his career before his death in a helicopter crash in 1990.
Figure 6-11 is a rhythm riff in the style of Stevie Ray Vaughan that features a 
hard-swinging rhythm part punctuated with short single-note phrases, fol-
lowed by an aggressive lead phrase. The key here is to dig in on the notes, 
with both the right and left hands, especially on the lead parts. Part of what 
gave Vaughan his sound was that he strung his guitar with heavy-gauge

strings. This produced a big, fat tone, to be sure, but required him to really 
attack the guitar aggressively to subordinate the string tension that fought 
him, especially when bending strings. But you could see in his performances 
that he enjoyed working hard at it, that he loved the struggle.

U2’s The Edge
Hailing from Dublin, Ireland, U2 is one of the world’s biggest bands, pack-
ing stadiums and creating multi-platinum-selling albums such as War, 
Unforgettable Fire, The Joshua Tree, Rattle and Hum, Achtung Baby, and 
Zooropa. The band won two Grammy Awards in 1987, including Album of the 
Year (The Joshua Tree). The band’s success continues with their most recent 
Grammy Awards for How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, released in 2004.
U2’s guitarist David Evans, known as The Edge, is a strikingly original player 
whose style is difficult to categorize. He is the master of treating the guitar as 
an ensemble instrument and a leader in the group of expert effects users and 
minimalists that includes Brian May of Queen, Andy Summers of the Police, 

260
Book III: Rock Guitar 
and Robert Fripp of King Crimson. He uses signal processors and effects 
to high art, and it’s often hard to tell that what you’re listening to is even a 
guitar. He regards the guitar as a tool for creating texture rather than just as 
a weapon to pound out chords or a device for taking the obligatory single-line 
solo. The Edge was a lightning bolt of creative inspiration to rock, making the 
guitar important again in ways no one imagined.
Figure 6-12 is a rhythm figure in the style of The Edge, using some of his 
hallmarks: an arpeggiated treatment of an exotic chord progression, a deftly 
placed harmonic, and a reliance of outboard effects to achieve a rich, tex-
tured approach to rhythm-track layering.

Let the arpeggios ring out as long as possible and play exactly in rhythm so

Tony Iommi
Led Zeppelin may have been the driving force behind 1970s heavy metal, but 
none would dispute Black Sabbath’s place in the grand metal pantheon. The 
members of Sabbath distilled a grim view of reality and turned it into some-
thing darker and more sinister sounding than anything Jimmy Page ever came 
up with. Fronting Black Sabbath was the twin force of vocalist Ozzy Osbourne 
and guitarist Tony Iommi. Although Ozzy was barely a singer in technical 
terms, he proved a devastatingly effective and charismatic frontman. Iommi, 
who could turn the basic power chord into a towering wall of doom and 
gloom, was a surprisingly nimble soloist — especially for a guy missing parts 
of some fingers. (Remember that when you’re whining about fingering!)

261
 Chapter 6: Rock Guitar Legends, Styles, and Genres
Book III
Rock 
Guitar
Iommi’s combination of distorted, two-note power chords and fast pentatonic-
based solos (on a Gibson SG) helped carve out the sound of early metal. 
Iommi uses this signature approach on such classic Sabbath tracks as 
“Paranoid,” “War Pigs,” “N.I.B.,” and the FM radio staple “Iron Man.”
In all, Black Sabbath was a group that played a brand of rock ’n’ roll that was 
grimy, violent, and full of darkness. As such, you can see why contempo-
rary thrash acts such as Metallica and Megadeth preferred the killer riffs of 
Sabbath over the polished guitar licks of Led Zeppelin. Figure 6-13 shows a 
power-chord riff that is very much in the style of Iommi — simple, heavy, and 
menacing. Amazingly, Tony himself is a very sweet-natured, charming man in 
person. Just goes to show that you can’t judge a metalhead by his riffs.

Ritchie Blackmore
Deep Purple was another top metal band of the 1970s, inspiring everyone 
from Judas Priest to Yngwie Malmsteen. Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore is 
very influential, being the first major player to meld a heavy guitar tone with 
classical technique and harmony. He also follows Jimi Hendrix’s example and 
uses a Stratocaster through Marshalls (most early metal players preferred 
a solid body with humbuckers, such as a Gibson Les Paul). Deep Purple’s 
most celebrated song is “Smoke on the Water,” a 1972 hit with dead-simple 
riffs and slippery Blackmore solos. Other tracks — such as “Strange Kind 
of Woman,” “Mistreated,” “Woman from Tokyo,” and “Burn” — also display 
Blackmore’s fast hammer-on runs, violent vibrato bar, and melodic phrasing.
One of the best examples of his classical side is on “Highway Star” (from Machine 
Head). Here, Blackmore weaves quickly picked intervals based on Bach into his 
lead. The lick in Figure 6-14 offers a simplified Baroque-era-influenced phrase in 
the Blackmore tradition. Try it slowly at first and then bring it up to speed.

Eddie Van Halen
Rock guitar was getting pretty stale and boring in the late 1970s, with most 
rock guitarists relying on the same pentatonic-blues scales for their solos 
that Clapton, Beck, Page, and Hendrix had introduced a decade earlier. Then 
came Eddie Van Halen. Fronting his band of the same name, Eddie Van Halen 
strapped on a homemade Strat-style electric and blasted out solos of fluid 
hammer-ons, crazed whammy bar dives, and a wacky two-handed striking 
technique.
Perhaps the most obvious Van Halen trademark is the two-handed tap 
(where notes are sounded using the right-hand fingertips to slam the string 
onto the fretboard, rather than brushing the strings). A right-hand tap is 
always followed by a right-hand pull-off, either to a fretted or an open string. 
Then a left-hand finger hammers and pulls off as well. This produces a strik-
ingly fluid sound and enables the guitarist to play wider intervals than pos-
sible with conventional left-hand technique.
Figure 6-15 is an example of right-hand tapping technique over an eight-bar, 
classically constructed chord progression. The taps arpeggiate the chords in 
a smooth and fluid manner that conventional techniques can’t emulate.

Angus Young
During the 1980s, when speed and virtuoso technique dominated most rock 
guitarists’ styles, the Australian band AC/DC rocked the globe with clean 
power chords, economical rhythm arrangements, and aggressive, blues-
based solos. With his brother Malcolm playing kick-ass power chords, Angus 
Young relies on slow solos and Chuck Berry-style double-stops in solos to 
hard-rocking anthems such as “You Shook Me All Night Long,” “Highway 
to Hell,” and “Shoot to Thrill.” The key to emulating Angus’s solos is not to 
listen to other metal players, but instead blues guitarists such as B.B. King, 
Eric Clapton, or Stevie Ray Vaughan and bend the strings with soul.
Figure 6-16 shows a simple, bluesy lick in the style of Angus Young. Here 
again, the emphasis is on feel over speed.

David Gilmour
If Pink Floyd is the ultimate “space rock” band, then David Gilmour is its 
pilot. While other progressive rock players exude strange and exotic influ-
ences in their solos, Gilmour is on the traditional side, more of a bluesy gui-
tarist in the mold of Eric Clapton than a sonic revolutionary. Nevertheless, 
his haunting solos help define the Floyd sound as much as the obscure lyrics 
and ethereal synthesizers.
Listen to “Time” (from the mega-platinum Dark Side of the Moon), where 
Gilmour cuts an echoey lead laced with string bends. “Shine On You Crazy 
Diamond” (from 1975’s Wish You Were Here) includes a series of soulful 
solos over a basic minor-blues backbeat. His best-known break, however, is 
in the power ballad from The Wall, “Comfortably Numb.” Technically, it’s a 
basic blues-rock solo, but one that’s elevated to operatic proportions due to 
a highly dramatic chord progression. In Figure 6-17, the secret to success is 
that it’s in a “space rock” context, however — not a conventional blues one. 
Imagine B.B. King jamming with Yanni and you’ll get the picture.

Alex Lifeson
A powerhouse player, Alex Lifeson remains among the most innovative rock 
guitarists of the last three decades. His work with the Canadian power trio 
Rush is marked by blazing melodic solos, shimmering rhythm parts, and a 
frequent use of chorus and echo. Some of his best electric solos are in tracks 
such as “La Villa Strangiato,” a complex instrumental, and “Limelight,” which 
includes tasteful tremolo bar effects and a strong sense of melody.
In addition to his fiery lead work, Lifeson is also a skilled rhythm guitarist 
and makes extensive use of chorus effects in his arpeggiated chord progres-
sions. He is equally at home with electric, acoustic, or classical guitars. A 
veritable jack-of-all-guitar-trades, Lifeson often pushes the envelope of rock 
guitar — and licks and stamps it, too.
Figure 6-18 concentrates on Lifeson’s unique chord parts. Instead of block 
barre chords, Lifeson often lets the upper E and B strings ring open, making 
his 6-string guitars sound like 12-strings. Add a chorus pedal to heighten the 
effect.

In This Chapter
 What defines blues guitar music
 How acoustic and electric guitars each make the blues in their own way
 The essential gear you need to play the blues
T
he guitar and blues go together like apple and pie. The guitar allows you 
to sing along with yourself (try that with a flute), and singing is the way 
the blues started. And a guitar is much easier to bring out on the front porch 
than a piano. It’s also cheaper to own (or make yourself) than many other 
instruments, and that helped bring blues music to many poor folks — the 
people who really had the blues.
Because the blues was concentrated in the rural South, in the time before 
musical instruments adopted electricity, the earliest blues guitar music was 
played on acoustics. The “Delta blues” style was the first recognized style 
of the blues and consisted of strummed and plucked acoustic guitars with 
chords formed as in other forms of folk music.
As the blues developed, guitar makers adopted features that helped bring 
out the qualities of the blues to even better effect. An electric guitar is played 
with two hands and leaves your mouth free to sing (as an acoustic does), 
but electrics, with their skinnier strings, are easier to bend — stretching the 
string while it’s ringing produces a gradual, continuous rise in pitch — and 
electronic amplification helps project the guitar’s sound out into the audi-
ence of (often raucous and noisy) blues-loving listeners. In this chapter, you 
discover in detail why the blues and the guitar make great music together.

Book IV: Blues Guitar 
Beyond the Delta: Defining 
the Blues Guitar Sound
Blues guitar can take many forms and has grown dramatically since its humble 
beginnings in the southern United States. Blues players were traditionally 
self-taught, and many were illiterate. One of the easiest ways to create dif-
ferent chords was to tune the guitar to an open chord, such as G major or 
E major, and then use a slide — such as a pocket knife or bottle neck — to 
change chords. In both slide and fretted guitar styles, guitarists would 
emphasize the driving rhythm of the blues by thumping out steady bass 
notes on the low strings with their thumb while fingerpicking upper strings 
for chords, melodic riffs, and fills.
Playing simple chords to back up a blues singer is still a form of blues guitar — 
as is playing chords with a slide. You can’t help but sound bluesy when you 
move a slide from one position to another to play the different chords in a 
song, especially if you do it expressively. But beyond this, you can ascribe 
certain musical hallmarks to the blues that don’t make you play any more soul-
fully but provide you with a deeper understanding when you hear the blues.
The following sections break down the elements of the blues into four musi-
cal concepts. Keep in mind that these concepts are the main ones and there 
are certainly more, but thinking of and listening to the blues while consid-
ering these criteria helps in your understanding of this sometimes elusive 
music form. You may not be able to define the blues, but you know it when 
you hear it. Or as Sonny Terry says:
Sometimes I want to holler,
Sometimes I want to shout,
Sometimes I want to cry,
But I wonder what about.
I think I got the blues.
The method to the music: 
Chord progressions
What defines a blues song is the way chords are put together, or the chord 
progression. Although there’s such a thing as a jazz chord, there’s not really 
a blues chord (there’s no such thing as a classical chord, either). But if you 

271
 Chapter 1: Blues Meets Guitar: A Match Made in Heaven
Book IV
Blues 
Guitar
put certain chords together in a certain way, you can definitely have a blues 
chord progression. The most common blues progression is the 12-bar blues, 
which is covered, along with the others, in Chapter 3 in Book IV.
Chords used in blues include major and minor triads (simple, three-note 
chords), dominant 7 chords — triads with the flatted (lowered by a half 
step) 7th added — and sometimes even jazz chords (with complex-sounding 
names like G13%9/%5).
The guitarist’s language of melody
 
The blues definitely has a harmonic and melodic language. It even has a scale 
named after it: the six-note blues scale. If music is described as “bluesy,” it 
usually means that the melody borrows or enlists notes from the blues scale 
(nicknamed “blue notes”) rather than the standard major and minor scales 
that make up other, non-blues styles. Blue notes are the minor 3rd, minor 
7th, and flatted 5th (in shorthand, flat 3 or %3, %5, and %7). Figure 1-1 shows the 
C major scale (the familiar do, re, mi, and so forth) with the blue notes shown 
beneath their unaltered counterparts.

When discussing scales, you don’t include the octave note, in this case, the 
second, higher C. That’s why it’s in parentheses. So a major scale is really 
a seven-note scale, though in practice musicians usually include the octave 
eighth note.
When playing the blues, guitarists incorporate aspects of both the major 
scale and the blue notes to come up with two new scales of their own: the six-
note blues scale and the five-note minor pentatonic scale (covered in Chapter 
3 in Book III). Figure 1-2 shows both scales in the key of C in letter names and 
in music notation.
If all this talk of scales, intervals, and flat this and that are making your eyes 
roll, don’t worry. You don’t need to know any of this to play the blues or to 
even hear it. It’s a peek under the hood, is all.

The expression that invokes your senses
One of the best things about the blues — and a huge relief to beginning 
guitarists — is that the blues isn’t all that hard to play, technically speaking. 
Playing lead or rhythm in most blues songs requires only intermediate tech-
nique. What is harder to do — in fact, you never stop figuring out how to do 
it better — is to play expressively. Expression in the blues is what turns craft 
into art. Check out these ways to make your music more bluesy:
 
 Use bent notes: Bent notes are notes where the pitch is raised slowly 
upward in a continuous fashion, and this element is closely identified 
with the blues.
 
 Make your music shake: Vibrato is a technique that makes the notes of 
the music quiver by using left-hand finger wiggling, which gives blues a 
signature sound. B.B. King is well-known for his expressive and soulful 
vibrato. Because much of the blues is set to medium tempos, players 
hold notes for long periods of time. Vibrato is a great way to bring notes 
to life, so they don’t just sit there.
 
 Give it some slide: If you don’t hit notes straight on but rather slide into 
notes from above and below, you give music a bluesy feel and breathe 
some life into your notes. Guitarists often draw their inspiration from 
vocalists and horn players (saxophone, trumpet, trombone, and so on), 
who exercise the slide technique on a regular basis.
 
 Slur your notes: Connecting notes through slurs — where you don’t 
restrike the second note with the right hand — is a good way to loosen 
up your playing in the typical way a blues player does.
 
 Allow the rhythm to flow: Blues also allows a certain rhythmic liberty 
to be taken with melodies — especially letting the melody notes deliber-
ately fall after, or behind, the beat. It’s been described as lazy, devil may 
care, or cavalier. Whatever you call it, it sure makes the notes sound 
more bluesy.

The groove that sets the pace
Groove is often used informally to mean “on the mark” or “in sync with,” but 
here the term refers to the meter, rhythmic feel, and tempo, and the instru-
ments’ role in providing the accompaniment, or backing figures. Several dif-
ferent grooves exist within the blues:
 
 A shuffle is a type of groove that uses triplet eighth notes with the 
emphasis on sounding just the first and third notes played at a medium 
tempo. “Sweet Home Chicago” is an example of a song in a shuffle 
groove.
 
 A slow 12/8 blues (the “12/8” refers to the time signature) is another 
type of groove that’s also based on three-note groups, but the tempo is 
slower and all three notes of the beat are pronounced. “Stormy Monday” 
is a song in a slow 12/8 feel.
 
 A straight-four groove is where the eighth notes are evenly spaced apart, 
rather than in the long-short scheme of a shuffle. “Johnny B. Goode” is in 
a straight-four.
Given the infinite forms of expression the blues takes, it’s nice to know that at 
least from a technical standpoint, you need to master only a few grooves to 
play most of the blues music out there.
Dissecting Acoustic and 
Electric Blues Guitars
Anatomically speaking, guitars come in two sexes: acoustic and electric. 
Because solid-body electric guitars don’t make sound acoustically but 
through electronics, like females they have more chromosomal material — 
er, components — than do acoustics. Some of the functions of these gizmos 
aren’t even obvious until you plug in and start messing around with them.
About the only thing that can go wrong with an acoustic is that a string 
breaks. On an electric, more moving and electronic parts are subject to 
failure, so you have a little more to keep track of on an electric. And all gui-
tars, being made of wood and moving parts, can go out of whack and need 
periodic adjustment to keep them humming and happy. (Flip to Chapter 1 in 
Book I for details on all the parts of a guitar — both the acoustic version and 
the electric kind.)
The practical differences between the two types of guitars is, in sum, that an 
electric guitar needs to plug in to an amp and have electricity to be heard, 
but it’s easier to play than an acoustic. An acoustic works with nothing 
but the fingers nature gave you, and its loudness is limited to a range of a 

274
Book IV: Blues Guitar 
few dozen feet, and in a quiet environment — unless it is miked, of course. 
Acoustics can’t sustain like electrics can, either, so their lead qualities are 
more restricted, too. In this section, you get details on both guitars, but take 
note that the fundamental principles for acoustic guitars, and the way their 
strings produce notes, apply to electrics as well — the acoustic is that baby’s 
daddy, after all.
The foundation for all guitar playing: 
Acoustic guitars
In the old days, gut- and steel-string acoustics were used as a means to accom-
pany a singing voice or another melodic instrument, like the fiddle. Gradually 
the rhythms evolved into single-note figures (riffs), and then finally into a 
solo instrument, where the guitar would carry the melody. Blues played on 
the acoustic guitar remains a viable style today, as evidenced by the work of 
Rory Block, Roy Book Binder, John Hammond, Keb’ Mo’, and Chris Thomas 
King, among others. So the first step in playing the blues is to understand how 
acoustic guitars work and why they’re so perfect for playing the blues.
In guitar, the hands perform different functions — unlike, say, the piano or 
saxophone where the hands work the same way. In guitar playing, the left-
hand fingers press down the strings at different frets, which creates different 
sounding pitches. The right hand actually produces the sound by strumming 
or plucking the strings. So the two hands need each other, and they must 
coordinate their efforts so they move together to create chords and single 
notes in rhythm. In blues guitar playing, unlike large governmental bureau-
cracies, the right hand must know what the left hand is doing, and vice versa.
 
Good guitar players, who know the fingerboard, can identify any string/fret 
location by its pitch (note name), no matter where it falls. The better guitar 
player you become, the more you’re able to look at the neck and quickly see 
notes and patterns.
Shifting acoustic to overdrive: 
Electric guitars
As soon as electric guitars were available, blues players of the day made the 
transition quickly and easily from their acoustic versions. An electric guitar 
uses the same approach to neck and frets and the way the left and right hands 
share separate but equally important roles — but it provides some advan-
tages that the acoustic guitar doesn’t, in addition to the most obvious one: 
increased volume through electronic amplification. The amplified electric 

275
 Chapter 1: Blues Meets Guitar: A Match Made in Heaven
Book IV
Blues 
Guitar
guitar certainly changed the music world, but in many more ways than just 
being able to be heard over the rest of the band. The entire tonal character of 
the instrument changed, in addition to the way you had to play it.
Technologically speaking, an electric guitar is no more complicated than an 
eighth-grade science project: A wire (the string) hovers over a magnet (the 
pickup), which forms a magnetic field. When you set the wire in motion (by 
plucking it), the vibrating, or oscillating, string creates a disturbance in the 
magnetic field, which produces an electrical current. This current travels 
down a cord (the one sticking out the side of your guitar) and into an ampli-
fier, where it’s cranked up to levels that people can hear — to say the least.
Naturally, there’s a lot more to the way electric guitars make music than this 
description, but what’s significant is that an electric guitar doesn’t make its 
sound acoustically. Even though you can hear the string when the guitar’s 
not plugged in, that’s not what the guitar “hears.” The guitar converts a dis-
turbance in the pickup’s magnetic field to a current. This all-electronic pro-
cess is different than “pre-electric guitar amplification,” which consisted of 
placing a microphone in front of a guitar.
In an electric guitar, you must use metal strings, because nylon ones don’t 
have magnetic properties. The fact that you need only a metal wire and a 
pickup to make sound — rather than a resonating chamber — meant electric 
guitars could be built differently from their acoustic counterparts. And they 
were played differently, though that took some time to evolve.
Bending strings
As a guitar player, what you notice as soon as you pick up an electric guitar 
is how easy it is to play. For the blues, as far as physical effort is concerned, 
electric guitars are much easier than acoustic guitars because
 
 The neck is shallower.
 
 The fingerboard width is thinner.
 
 The strings are lighter than those found on an acoustic.
 
 The action, or distance from the strings to the frets, is lower, so it frets 
almost effortlessly.
But the lighter strings have another advantage crucial to blues playing, 
other than being easier to play: They’re easier to bend. Bending strings just 
sounds bluesy. It allows electric guitarists to be more expressive in their lead 
playing, and allows the guitar to better emulate the vocal stylings of blues 
singers, who use their flexible approach to pitch to sing soulful blues notes. 
Figure 1-3 shows what it looks like to bend a string on an electric. The string 
is physically pushed sideways on the fretboard by the left hand, stretching it.

Noticing increased sustain
In the process of electrifying a guitar, blues players noticed something 
besides the loudness advantage: Electric guitars sustained longer. The notes 
just seemed to hang on longer instead of dying away quickly, as they did on 
acoustic guitars and banjos before that. As a result of this increased sustain, 
electric guitars were able to produce more substantial vibrated notes, bent 
notes, and long notes that held their sound. Along with jazz players, blues 
players found they could now more closely emulate vocal and horn stylings. 
A saxophone note, for example, will sound as long as your breath holds out, 
instead of decaying as an acoustic guitar note does. This change encouraged 
a more versatile approach to single-note, or lead, playing. Before the electric 
guitar, the guitar was largely a rhythm instrument, with some notable excep-
tions, such as the jazz playing of Eddie Lang, Lonnie Johnson, and gypsy gui-
tarist Django Reinhardt.
What Your Guitar Needs to 
Get Your Blues Groove On
To be a well-appointed blues guitar player, you need to have not only your 
acoustic or electric guitar, but also some other stuff that allows you to play 
to your fullest. Check out this list:

 Chapter 1: Blues Meets Guitar: A Match Made in Heaven
Book IV
Blues 
Guitar
 
 Picks: Being able to play with a pick is an important skill in blues play-
ing, and you should learn to play with one before deciding to be a rebel 
and go without. True, some traditional players of both acoustic and elec-
tric blues don’t use a pick. They use the unadorned fingers of the right 
hand to produce all of their blues sounds, from full strummed chords to 
riffs to leads.
 
 Spare strings: As far as “string breakage,” it’s not a question of if, but 
when. Strings break all on their own, even if you don’t play hard or bend 
them, but blues bending certainly shortens their lifespans. Carry spares 
so a sudden “string mishap” doesn’t shut down your jam for the night. 
(See Chapter 3 in Book I to find out how to change strings.)
 
 Tuner: Most guitar teachers will tell you that it should be illegal to allow 
beginning guitarists to roam the earth without a tuner. These days, the 
word “tuner” usually means “electronic tuner” — the battery-operated 
kind that you can plug into (or use the onboard mic, if you’re playing 
an acoustic). An electronic tuner is designed for quick and easy guitar 
tuning, and you can tune silently to boot. You can use other tuning 
methods — such as employing a pitch pipe, tuning fork, or the relative 
method (see Chapter 1 in Book I) — but the recommended way is to use 
a tuner. Given the distinctive quality of the blues notes, a tuner is an 
essential tool — and courtesy — for all who appreciate in-tune music.
 
 Effects pedals: Many blues players get along with just an amp, but most 
blues guitarists augment their sound with outboard effects — each 
about the size of a packet of index cards — to get even more sonic pos-
sibilities. Effects can make it sound like your guitar was recorded in a 
recording studio, or produce otherworldly sounds that may have more 
of a theatrical application than a musical one. But perhaps the biggest 
use of effects in the blues is to get a distorted sound. An effects pedal 
gives you this quality at low amp volumes. There are more distortion 
effects available than any other kind, and they’ll keep coming.
 
 Slide: To play slide, you need a slide apparatus, in the form of a metal or 
glass tube, bottle neck (you may as well use the beer you cried into), or 
medicine bottle. Or lots of other things. You can also buy a professional 
slide. They’re not expensive.

hords don’t by themselves convey anything meaningful. They’re just 
raw building materials of music until you arrange and play them in a 
certain way. For guitarists, the playing part comes when you add in the right 
hand. By playing chords with the right hand in a certain tempo, rhythm, and 
strumming pattern, you enter into the world of rhythm guitar — an indis-
pensable part of the blues.
Strumming Along
One of the most basic ways you can play chords is with a strum. Strumming 
involves taking your right hand and, with a pick, thumb, or the back of your 
fingernails, brushing it across several or all the strings, sounding them all 
together at once. A strum can be slow, fast, hard, or gentle, or any of the 
infinite shadings in between. When you strum, bring your hand from the top 
of the guitar (closest to the ceiling) to the bottom (toward the floor) in one 
motion, striking the strings along the way.
 
If you’ve never played with a pick before, you may find it takes a little time 
and practice to figure out how tightly to hold the pick when strumming (see 
Chapter 2 in Book I for more on picks). If you grip it too tightly, the pick gets 
tripped up in the strings and your right hand doesn’t flow smoothly. On the 
other hand, if you hold the pick too loosely, it may spring out of your fingers 
when you strike the strings. The important thing is to keep the right hand 
and arm flowing smoothly while you find just the right grip.

280
Part IV: Blues Guitar 
Stroking down . . .
You may not have thought of basic strumming as “executing a downstroke,” 
but that’s what you’re doing when you naturally strike the strings on a guitar. 
When you get to more complex strumming patterns — especially ones involv-
ing syncopation — you distinguish between downstrokes and upstrokes 
(see the next section). But for now, focus on the more popular and prevalent 
downstroke strum.
A downstroke (indicated in written music with the symbol 2) is played with 
a downward motion of the pick, toward the floor — the way you naturally 
strike a guitar. You can strum multiple strings or pick an individual string 
with a downstroke.
. . . And stroking up
An upstroke (indicated by the symbol 4) is played upward, toward the ceiling, 
in the opposite direction of a downstroke. So instead of dragging your pick 
down toward the floor, as you do in a downstroke, you start from a position 
below the first string and drag your pick upward across the strings, from 
1st to 6th. This motion may seem a little less natural and comfortable than a 
downstroke, but with practice, you can perform upstrokes as easily and with 
as much control as downstrokes.
 
In an upstroke, you don’t need to worry about hitting all the strings. The top 
three or four strings are usually sufficient. For example, when playing an E 
chord with an upstroke, you don’t have to strum the strings all the way from 
the 1st to the 6th, just up to about the 3rd or 4th string. There are exceptions 
to this rule, but generally, in the blues, you don’t hit as many strings on an 
upstroke strum as you do in a downstroke.
 
Upstrokes don’t get equal playing time with downstrokes. You typically use 
upstrokes only in conjunction with downstrokes, but you use downstrokes 
by themselves fairly often in blues playing.
Combining down and up
In certain fast lead passages, upstrokes alternate with downstrokes equally. 
For fast eighth notes, the strict observance of upstrokes following down-
strokes is called alternate picking. Alternate picking is the key to playing fast 
leads smoothly. The best thing is to practice upstrokes as they occur in their 
natural state — in an eighth-note rhythm in between downstrokes.

281
 Chapter 2: Playing Blues Rhythm
Book IV
Blues 
Guitar
Striking to a beat
Regardless of whether your hand moves up or down when it strikes the 
strings, the important thing to remember is that you’re striking in a rhythm — 
or in sync with the beat. If you strike the strings once per beat, you’re play-
ing quarter notes. If you play two strokes per beat, you’re playing in eighth 
notes, which come twice as fast as quarter notes.
 
If you need help hearing just what the beat is, get a metronome — an elec-
tronic device that taps out the beat for you. You can buy a metronome at 
any music store, and many models are small enough to fit right in your guitar 
case.
Quarter-note striking, beat by beat
Figure 2-1 shows two bars of an E chord with quarter-note slashes. You play 
four strums for each bar for a total of eight strums. The quarter notes tell you 
that the strums occur once per beat.
 
Figure 2-1: 
Strumming 
an E chord 
in quarter 
notes for 
two bars.
 
E
etc.
Eighth-note striking, twice per beat
Eighth notes occur twice as frequently as quarter notes in the same tempo, 
or two for every beat instead of one. In written guitar notation, instead of the 
slashes shown in Figure 2-1, you now face slashes with beams — horizontal 
lines that connect the stems. Quarter notes have just a stem attached to 
them; eighth notes have stems with beams connecting them to each other. 
An eighth note by itself has a flag instead of a beam: e.
For the eighth notes that appear in Figure 2-2, you strum twice as fast — 
twice per beat — as you do for the quarter notes. You can do this easily 
using only downstrokes at most blues tempos, which are slow to moderate 
(between 60 and 160 beats per minute). To make things interesting, you 
change chords and introduce A and B7 into the mix. Note that in the figure, 
the last note of each bar is a quarter note, which gives you a little more time 
than two eighth notes would for changing chords. Aren’t we nice?

Figure 2-3 combines downstrokes and upstrokes in an eighth-note rhythm. 
As you practice this passage, keep a relaxed, free-swinging, up-and-down 
arm motion going. Also work to get equal emphasis on the downstrokes and 
upstrokes. You may notice that your downstrokes naturally include more and 
lower strings, while the upstrokes play just the top strings and fewer of them. 
This is perfectly natural.

At a moderate tempo, you can easily play Figure 2-3 with all downstrokes, 
but that variation gives the figure a different feel — more driving and intense. 
It may be a subtle difference, but playing an eighth-note figure in all down-
strokes — versus playing it with alternating downstrokes and upstrokes — is 
a musical choice, not a technical consideration.
Mixing Single Notes and Strumming
Downstrokes and upstrokes are used for playing single notes, as well as for 
strumming. Combining single notes with strums is an important part of blues 
rhythm guitar playing and gives you more options than just strumming. For 
example, a piano player doesn’t plunk down all of her fingers at once every 
time she plays, and guitarists shouldn’t have to strike all the strings every 
time they bring their picks down (or up).
Because of their instrument’s layout, keyboardists play bass notes with the 
left hand and chords with the right hand. When guitarists separate the bass 
notes from the chord, they do it with just the right hand, but the principle is 
the same.

283

Book IV

Separating bass and treble: 
The pick-strum
Separating the bass and treble so they play independently is a great way to 
provide rhythmic variety and introduce different textures into your playing. 
In the pick-strum pattern, the pick refers to picking the single bass note, and 
the strum refers to the upper-string chord that follows. Both the pick and the 
strum are played with the pick in downstrokes.
Figure 2-4 is a simple pick-strum pattern that’s used in many folk blues and 
country blues songs. This notation mixes single notes (which appear with 
normal, rounded noteheads) and rhythm slashes (with the narrower, elon-
gated noteheads).

Playing common pick-strum patterns
Most strumming patterns in blues are either all strums or a pick-strum com-
bination, and which approach you use depends on the instruments in your 
ensemble at the time. A pick-strum approach is good for solo playing or if 
you’re the only rhythm instrument, because the bass notes fall on different 
parts of the measure than the chord parts.

284
Part IV: Blues Guitar 
If you’re playing solo guitar, you play a lot more pick-strum patterns. In a 
band setting, you usually have a bass player who handles the bass duties, 
and it’s more appropriate to play all strumming patterns so as not to get 
in his way. The following sections describe two pick-strum patterns for the 
most common blues feels.
Two-beat or cut shuffle
This is sometimes referred to as a boom-chick pattern because the bass note 
and chords alternate, as shown in Figure 2-5. A two-beat feel is common in 
other forms of music (Dixieland and big-band jazz, polka, samba, and coun-
try), but it has its place in the blues, too.

Part IV: Blues Guitar 
Shuffling the Beats with 
Syncopated Strumming
After you develop a feel for strumming in different combinations of quarters, 
eighths, and 16ths — which come four per beat, or twice as fast as eighth 
notes — you can increase the rhythmic variation to these various groupings 
by applying syncopation. Syncopation is the disruption or alteration of the 
expected sounds of notes. In blues rhythm playing, you can apply syncopa-
tion by staggering your strum and mixing up your up- and downstrokes to 
strike during different parts of the beats. By doing so, you let the agents of 
syncopation — dots, ties, and rests — steer your rhythmic strumming to a 
more dramatic and interesting course.
A bit of notation: Dots that 
extend and ties that bind
In written music, a dot attached to a note increases its rhythmic value by half 
the original length. So a dot attached to a half note (two beats) makes it three 
beats long. A dotted quarter note is one and a half beats long — or the total 
of a quarter note plus an eighth note.
A tie is a curved line that connects two notes of the same pitch. The value of 
the tied note adds to the original, so that only the first note is sounded, but 
the note is held for the duration of the two notes added together.
Figure 2-7 shows a chart of how dots and ties alter the standard note values 
of eighth, quarter, and half notes.

Syncopation: Playing with dots and ties
So how do dots and ties actually make syncopation work in a musical con-
text? There are two progressions — one in a straight-eighth feel and another 
in a shuffle — that you can practice playing in this section. They both have 
common syncopation figures used in the blues.
 
The normal flow of down- and upstrokes is interrupted in syncopation, so it’s 
important to recall which stroke direction to play a note to avoid getting your 
strums out of sync.
In both Figures 2-8 and 2-9, pay close attention to the downstroke (2) and 
upstroke (4) indications.

288
Part IV: Blues Guitar 
 
 Figure 2-8 is a straight-eighth-note feel, in the key of A. The use of dots 
and ties signals a syncopated rhythm. If the tied figures present a prob-
lem, practice the figure by first ignoring the ties (in other words, play 
the tied note).

 Figure 2-9 is in a shuffle feel in the key of A. A shuffle rhythm divides the 
quarter note into two eighth notes — but the first eighth note is held 
longer than the second, producing a swinging, lilting feel. The same syn-
copation scheme appears here as it did in Figure 2-8, but the shuffle feel 
makes it fall in a slightly different place in the beat.

Stopping the Strings from Ringing 
(Just for a Sec)
Listen to blues rhythm guitar and you hear that it’s not one repetitive wall of 
sound, but an open, varied sound with breathing room and subtle breaks. It’s 
these breaks that prevent the chord strums from running into each other and 
creating sonic mush. The little gaps in sound keep a strumming figure sound-
ing crisp and controlled.

289
 Chapter 2: Playing Blues Rhythm
Book IV
Blues 
Guitar
Muting the sound between 
two chords (left hand)
To create a rhythm guitar part with some breathing space between the notes, 
you need to stop the strings from ringing momentarily. And we’re talking very 
small moments here — much smaller than can be indicated by a rest symbol 
in the music. You can stop the strings instantly with the left hand. Letting the 
left hand go limp is the best and quickest way to stop a string from ringing — 
far faster and more controlled than anything you can do with the right hand. 
This is actually a coordinated effort between the two hands, because it can 
only occur when the right hand plays.
To get the left hand to mute (indicated in written notation by an X notehead) 
the in-between sound between any two chords, just relax the fretting fin-
gers enough to release pressure on the fretted strings. The strings instantly 
deaden, completely cutting off the sound. If your right hand keeps going in 
the established strumming pattern, you produce a satisfying thunk sound as 
the right hand hits the deadened strings.
The muted strings intermixed with the sounding strings create a percussive 
and syncopated rhythm. Allowing your left hand to mute means you don’t 
have to stop and start your right hand to produce syncopation. You can keep 
it going uninterrupted, in alternating down- and upstrokes.
Simulating syncopation 
with left-hand muting
Left-hand muting gives you the means to control the strings’ sound. Figure 
2-10 is technically a straight-ahead down-up eighth-note strum in the right 
hand. But because you employ left-hand muting, the sound seems to cut off 
in just the right places, creating a syncopated sound. Your right hand isn’t 
performing true syncopation, because it’s playing straight through. It’s just 
that some of the notes don’t come through audibly.

Part IV: Blues Guitar 
 
Guitarists seem to develop left-hand muting naturally, almost as if it isn’t a 
technique you have to learn but a way of playing that is self-evident. So don’t 
try to analyze it too much or slow your playing down as you’re learning; just 
strum and relax and tighten your left hand in the context of a medium-tempo 
groove. Eventually, your two hands sync up without even thinking about it.
Muting the sound of a note (right hand)
Right-hand muting is entirely separate from left-hand muting and produces 
a totally different effect. When you mute with your right hand, you still hear 
the pitch and tone of the vibrating string but in a subdued way — more like a 
true mute, in the musical sense. Right-hand muting keeps the string from ring-
ing freely and reduces the volume and ringing of your strings while still main-
taining drive and intensity. This technique is a great way to add dramatic 
variation to your playing.
Palm mute is another name for right-hand muting. It’s executed by resting 
the heel of your right hand on the strings just above the bridge. If you place 
your hand too far forward, you completely deaden the strings, so place it just 
forward enough of the bridge that the strings still sound but are dampened. 
Keep your hand in position through the duration of the strum.
The accent is the opposite of a palm mute: It highlights a strike and lets the 
resulting sound ring out. To accent a chord, just strike it harder than usual 
and allow the strings to ring free. An accent is indicated with a > mark, just 
above or below the notehead.
Palm mutes are usually applied to only one or two strings, because the right 
hand is restricted when you rest it directly on the strings above the bridge. 
Figure 2-11 is a rhythm figure where you strike only the lowest two strings of 
the chord during the palm mutes and the upper strings on the accents. Play 
this progression by using all downstrokes to add intensity.

Copying the Classics: Plucking 
Fingerstyle Blues
If you want to make money playing the blues, you should probably get your-
self an electric guitar and play it with a pick. But if you want insight into the 
roots of the blues, grab an acoustic and play it fingerstyle. Acoustic finger-
style blues is a wonderful tradition, populated with such immortal figures as 
Robert Johnson, Skip James, Lightnin’ Hopkins, Mance Lipscomb, Leadbelly, 
Mississippi John Hurt, Reverend Gary Davis, John Hammond, Rory Block, Roy 
Book Binder, Bob Brozman, Jerry Reed, and Chet Atkins.
Early solo blues guitar players quickly realized that separating the thumb and 
fingers was a great way to get the bass line going independent of the chords 
and riffs above it. Acoustic fingerstyle blues is best played with an indepen-
dent thumb. You use the thumb to hit the bass notes while the fingers brush 
the treble strings, but independent thumb means that the thumb and fingers 
can play separate musical roles — almost like a mini rhythm section. The 
thumb can be the bass player, and the fingers can provide chords like the 
guitar’s traditional role.

292
Part IV: Blues Guitar 
Figure 2-12 shows a basic fingerstyle pattern where the thumb drives out a 
steady quarter note rhythm on the low strings, and the thumb plays chords 
on the offbeats. Listen closely to the CD to capture the shuffle feel in this 
figure.

Feels and Grooves: Different 
Rhythm Styles to Play
Blues consists of a few different feels or grooves — rhythm styles — and if 
some songs sound like others, as many say, it’s partly because of the rela-
tively few feels. Table 2-1 is a list of the common blues feels and well-known 
songs written in that feel (and if you don’t know these songs, find them and 
listen to them).

The shuffle groove
The shuffle groove is certainly the most common feel in blues — even more 
common than the straight-four and slow 12/8 feel. There’s one small hurdle 
to get over: A shuffle feel uses a triplet-based rhythmic division, where each 
quarter note is divided into three eighth notes, called triplets. The typical 
melodic division is two eighth notes, where the first note is held for the dura-
tion of the first two notes of the triplet, and the second eighth note is the 
third note of the triplet. This yields a lopsided, lilting feel in the eighth-note 
flow that’s the heart of the shuffle sound.
Figure 2-13 is a progression in a shuffle feel. Practice while listening to the CD 
on this one to make sure that you get the sound of the shuffle.

The driving straight-four
The straight in straight-four refers to the eighth notes being evenly spaced, just 
as they are in most normal music forms you encounter. The four is 4/4 time, 
which is the most common time signature for blues. This explanation may 
sound mundane, except when you consider that most blues is in a shuffle 
feel, so the word straight indicates that you’re doing something a little uncom-
mon for the blues. Figure 2-14 shows a driving straight-four groove.

The slow 12/8, with groups of three
The slow part of the slow 12/8 feel is easy to grasp. The 12/8 is related to 
the shuffle, because a shuffle is a 4/4 feel based on triplet divisions of eighth 
notes. But in 12/8, the feel is slower, and the individual eighth notes (they’re 
not called triplets, because their grouping of three is built into the time signa-
ture) are given more prominence.
 
Don’t be intimidated by the 12/8 part of this feel. There are 12 eighth notes 
to the bar, and each eighth note gets one beat. In practice though, the eighth 
notes are grouped in four units of three each. So it’s a lot like 4/4 time with 
eighth-note triplets on every beat. If it’s a slow blues and you can hear note-
groupings of three, it’s probably a 12/8 feel.
Famous blues songs in 12/8 include T-Bone Walker’s “Stormy Monday,” cov-
ered by the Allman Brothers on their Live at Fillmore album. Figure 2-15 is a 
passage in the style of “Stormy Monday.”

The slow and funky 16 feel
More modern blues grooves include the 16 feel, which has a slower tempo 
but funkier sound due to the 16th-note subdivisions. (James Brown’s “I Feel 
Good” and “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” are classic examples of 16th-note–
based funk.) “Hard to Handle,” written by Otis Redding and covered by the 
Black Crowes, is a famous example of 16-feel blues. Figure 2-16 is medium 
tempo, funky groove in a 16 feel.

T
he blues is a welcoming, beckoning music for both listener and performer 
that says, “Join in and start contributing!” The blues’ repetition and call-
and-response qualities — derived from its forebears, the work song and field 
holler — make it easy for people to join in a song on the fly. Musicians grasp 
the form quickly, and listeners have an expectation that’s set up by each 
phrase, which is then satisfied by the lyrics or the chord progression. Best of 
all, these simple, infectious, and ingenious devices that make the blues relat-
able are easy to understand and master, and are covered in this chapter.
Blues by the Numbers
You can learn music a lot quicker if you associate chords and keys by their 
numerical equivalents. In any key, the root or tonic (the tone that names the 
key or chord) is called I, and subsequent pitches become II, III, IV, and so on, 
numbers expressed in Roman numerals. So in the key of C, the numbers are 
broken down like this:
 
 C is I
 
 D is II
 
 E is III
 
 F is IV
And so on.

304
Book IV: Blues Guitar 
As keys change, so do the notes, expressed as letter names — but the num-
bers, or relationships, remain the same, allowing you to treat all keys equally. 
The number system works well for building chords by intervals, too, but in 
the blues, you’re more concerned with chords formed on the notes of the 
scale of a key.
 
If you memorize the basic blues chord formula in numbers (I, IV, V), then you 
can figure out the progression in any key because the numbers — and there-
fore the relationships — don’t change, no matter what key it’s in. Many have 
realized that because there are only seven letters in music (A through G), you 
can just memorize the keys without converting numbers to letters. And the more 
experienced you become, the more your ears take you to the right chord without 
having to memorize anything. In short: The numbers reveal the underlying struc-
ture and are important in understanding the function of the chords.
Musicians often refer to chords by their numerical designation instead of 
their actual letter name. For example, when a musician says, “In that song, 
listen to what B.B. does when he goes to the IV chord,” you know exactly 
where in the song that is (bar 5). If the musician had said, “When he goes to 
the D chord,” you’d have to know what key he was in first, and you or the sto-
ryteller may not have that information.
Viewing music through these numbers makes the key irrelevant to a blues 
player. Or more precisely, the key can change all it wants, but the structure 
doesn’t, and that’s the important point of the exercise.
Recognizing the Big Dogs: Primary 
Key Families and Their Chords
 
Whether you play folk, rock, or blues, sooner or later you notice that certain 
chords seem to cluster together. If you think of these chords by their numeri-
cal assignments, or function, you see this phenomena is common to all keys. 
In every key, the main chords are the one, four, and five, represented by the 
Roman numerals I, IV, and V. These groupings of I, IV, V are known as fami-
lies. It’s a virtual certainty that whatever other chords you may find in a song, 
you always have a I, IV, and V. And many songs have only these three chords.
Here’s an example of how to figure out the I, IV, and V of different keys:
 
 In the key of A, A is the I chord. Count on your fingers up to your fourth 
finger, saying the letters of the alphabet as you go, and you find that the 
IV chord in A is D. The V chord, then, is E.
 
 In the key of C, C is the I chord. The IV chord is F. And the V chord is G.

Try it yourself with other keys, starting on I with the letter that names the 
key (in the key of G, G is I). Table 3-1 shows common blues keys and their I, 
IV, and V chords. There are other keys (for example, B and A%), but these are 
the most commonly used keys for blues guitar.

For guitarists, some keys and chords lend themselves to certain movements 
that sound especially good for the blues; other keys are less successful. The 
following section mixes up the keys so you get familiar with the different fam-
ilies. But the blues is most accommodating to the keys of E and A, especially 
when using open-position chords.
The Structure of a Blues Song, Baby
It’s time to give your hands some direction — to organize sounds into chord 
progressions and song forms. These larger organizing principles make the blues 
come alive and build a meaningful experience for the player and the listener. 
Through them, you watch techniques turn into expressions and patterns into 
musical messages. In this section, you take the shorter phrases of the right-hand 
patterns (covered in Chapter 2 in Book IV) and make them into actual songs.
 
A song is made up of a chord progression. The song’s form and chord progres-
sion are concepts that can be used almost interchangeably, with chord pro-
gression describing more often the harmonic architecture of the song. Many 
people can recognize a song form — such as the 12-bar blues — but as a gui-
tarist, you need to know the corresponding chord progression that makes up 
that 12-bar form. And you need to be able to identify the actual chords going 
by, as well as any variations to that form. In the blues, the progression is part 
of what makes the blues the blues. So, the progression is synonymous with 
the form. In other words, saying “the blues” implies a 12-bar structure with 
the chords falling at specific bars within that structure.

306
Book IV: Blues Guitar 
A chord progression isn’t the only aspect of a song, but it’s a pretty impor-
tant one because it forms the framework or structure that supports the other 
elements: melody, lyrics, riffs, and the solo sections.
Playing the 12-bar blues
The 12-bar blues is by far the most popular form for the blues. It consists of 
12 measures and observes a particular scheme as shown in Figure 3-1.

Figure 3-1 uses Roman numerals instead of letter names, because the pro-
gression is the same in every key. For example, if you play blues in E, then E 
is the I chord, A is the IV chord, and B or B7 is the V chord. With the corre-
sponding letters substituted for the Roman numerals, the progression looks 
like Figure 3-2.

B7 replaces B in Figure 3-2, mainly because B7 is easier to play. Technically, 
you could play B as a barre chord on the 2nd fret. But the main point is to 
convey the letter names dictated by the I, IV, and V, so playing either B7 or B 
is acceptable.
Because the slashes (those /// marks) leave some interpretation in what you’re 
playing, try this exercise with shuffle eighth notes — eighth notes that have 
a long-short rhythm scheme, explained in detail in Chapter 2 in Book IV — in 
alternating downstrokes and upstrokes. You hear this version on the CD, so 
see if you can match the rhythm of the performance on the audio.
If you’re a little shaky on the eighth-note strum for Figure 3-2, try first playing 
this blues with quarter-note downstrokes (also covered in Chapter 2 in Book 
IV). Don’t worry, you’re still in sync with the CD, but the guitar on the CD 
strums twice to your once. After you can play that comfortably, try playing 
with eighth-note downstrokes in a shuffle feel. And after that, try the alternate-
picking approach, which is, not surprisingly, also discussed in Chapter 2 in 
Book IV.
The quick four
The quick four is a variation on the 12-bar blues that occurs in the second 
bar, where you go to a IV chord — for example, when you go to A in the key 
of E — for one bar, and go back to the I chord for two bars. The quick four, as 
shown in Figure 3-3,  provides an opportunity for variation and interest in an 
otherwise unbroken stretch of four bars of the same chord.

The quick four happens almost as often as not in blues songs. Some songs 
that use the quick-four method include “Sweet Home Chicago” and “Hide 

308
Book IV: Blues Guitar 
Away.” Songs such as “Hound Dog” and “Johnny B. Goode” don’t use this 
variation. Most blues guitarists don’t think too much about whether a song 
has a quick four. They just look at someone else in the band who knows more 
than they do to see if they’re going to make that move in bar two or not.
 
The quick four happens very soon after you start the song, so if you’re at a 
jam session, or are playing along with a song for the first time, you must be 
on your toes to anticipate its use.
The turnaround
The turnaround is the last two bars of the progression that point the music 
back to the beginning. At the end of the 12-bar blues, you can repeat the pro-
gression or end it. Most of the time you repeat the progression to play addi-
tional verses and solos. To help get the progression ready for a repeat, you 
employ a turnaround, which sets up the repeat. At the most basic level, you 
can create a turnaround by just substituting a V chord for the I chord in the 
last bar — bar 12.
 
Practically all songs (blues or otherwise) end on the I chord, called the tonic 
chord of the key, so the substitution of the V chord creates a strong pull 
that brings the song back to the I chord at bar 1 of the progression. In any 
music, the V chord sounds like it wants to go back to the I chord. When the 
V chord occurs at the end of the progression, it tells musicians and listeners 
unmistakably that “we’re going back around again.” While the most basic 
application of a turnaround is just playing a V chord in the last bar, to most 
guitarists, a turnaround presents an opportunity to play a riff or lick (covered 
in Chapter 4 in Book IV). Figure 3-4 shows the last four bars of a 12-bar blues 
with a turnaround bar added.

a V chord in 
the last bar.

You may see the V chord in the turnaround bar with parentheses around it. 
This method is shorthand for saying that you use the turnaround optionally 
or whenever you decide to repeat the progression. When you want the pro-
gression to end, you ignore the parentheses and continue playing the I chord 
from the previous bar.
Slow blues
Slow blues is usually a 12-bar blues, but played in 12/8 time, using three strums 
to the beat. Because of the slower tempo, there’s often more opportunity to put 
in additional chords — especially 9th chords, a common slow-blues hallmark.
Figure 3-5 is a slow 12-bar blues in 12/8 time with its own moves added — 
moves that consist of adding chords a whole step higher before the main 
ones. But it’s still a 12-bar blues. You can hear a lot of this quality in the play-
ing of T-Bone Walker.
 
One irony of slow blues is that although the tempo is slower than a shuffle, 
and the changes come more slowly and are therefore more manageable, the 
lead playing is often very intricate, especially with regard to rhythm. If you 
ever get a chance to see transcribed guitar solos in print, look at the ones in 
a slow 12/8. The notation can get quite hairy!
The 12-bar blues in song
If you’re wondering how musical charts and 
symbols relate to the actual songs (melody and 
lyrics), here’s the quick version:
  The 12-bar blues breaks down neatly into 
three lines of four bars each. These three 
lines correspond to the vocal phrases.
  The vocal scheme of the blues is A-A-B. 
Each letter represents a sentence, com-
plete thought, or phrase of the lyric.
Think of any 12-bar blues, such as “Hound Dog,” 
“Stormy Monday,” “Kansas City,” “St. Louis 
Blues,” “Easy Rider,” or “Corrina, Corrina.” 
Each song has three lines per verse, with the 
first line repeated. Even though the first vocal 
line is repeated, it never sounds repetitious, 
because the chords underneath the lyric and 
melody change, which provides interest. You 
can actually sing any of these songs to any 
12-bar progression.

8-bar blues
The 8-bar blues is four bars shorter than the 12-bar blues, but the 8-bar blues 
doesn’t really follow a strict form the way the 12-bar blues does. The 8-bar 
blues encompasses several feels, tempos, and qualities — often an 8-bar blues 
has more chords in it than just the basic I, IV, and V, making it more “songlike” 
than a 12-bar blues. Figure 3-6 is an 8-bar blues played with a bass-strum pat-
tern by using a variety of chords.

Straight-four (or rock blues)
Straight-four is sometimes called rock blues or rock feel and means that you 
play even eighth notes supported by a heavy backbeat (emphasis on beats 
2 and 4, usually courtesy of a cracking snare drum). Most blues is in a non-
straight feel, meaning it’s either in a shuffle (a long-short scheme that derives 
from triplets) or a slow 12/8 feel (with three notes to the beat). So a straight-
four, which is common in rock, is actually rare in traditional blues.
Some examples of well-known songs in a straight-four include “Roll Over 
Beethoven,” “Johnny B. Goode,” and Albert King’s “Crosscut Saw.” Figure 3-7 
shows a straight-four progression in A with a variation on the 5-to-6 move 
(also called the Jimmy Reed, covered in the next section). This variation has 
the moving voice occasionally going up to the flat seven. (G in the A chord, C 
in the D chord, and D in the E chord.)

Applying Structures to Keys
Although every key is treated equally when discussing function and music 
theory (see “Blues by the Numbers” earlier in this chapter), the reality is that 
different keys and chords on the guitar present different moves. What you 
can do easily in E, you may not be able to do in G, and G has other options 
that E may not have. These variations are a delight (and frustration!) of play-
ing the guitar. Each key has something idiomatic that can’t be performed 
comfortably or convincingly in another key. Composers and musicians write 
and play songs in different keys to exploit these little differences that each 
key provides.

314
Book IV: Blues Guitar 
A move with many chords: 
The Jimmy Reed move
If you have the basic 12-bar blues under your belt, including the quick four 
and turnaround bar, it’s time to shake things up a bit. (See the correspond-
ing sections earlier in this chapter if you look under your belt and nothing’s 
there.) You can start off with a move that’s been a blues and rock staple for-
ever. It’s known by many different names, but because this book is a blues 
book, you can attribute it to one of its most famous practitioners: Jimmy Reed.
The Jimmy Reed move — named after the Chicago harmonica player, singer, 
and guitarist — involves going from the 5th to the 6th degrees in each chord 
(the note E in a G chord, A in a C chord). Chuck Berry made this technique 
famous in a straight-eighth, rock ’n’ roll setting in the late ’50s and ’60s. For 
now, don’t worry about converting numbers to notes for the I, IV, and V 
chords; just figure out the left-hand part.
To play a “move,” you put your left hand in motion. Figure 3-8 shows the 
Jimmy Reed move in the key of E, using E, A, and B power chords (for more 
on power chords, see Chapter 3 in Book II). The chord diagrams are given 
above the tab, allowing you to think of this move in two ways: as an extra 
chord inserted in between the ones you already know or as a simple one-
finger move in the left hand. Whichever way works for you is the right one!
 
One of the best things about the Jimmy Reed move is that it works so well in 
different chords and keys. When played in different keys, the figure preserves 
the original relationship of the notes in the new key, but because it’s in a dif-
ferent key, it just sounds, well, different. Not better or worse, perhaps, just 
different — and still very cool. It’s like singing “Happy Birthday” in the key 
of G or E%: You can recognize the melody in any key setting — but the Jimmy 
Reed move is so much hipper than “Happy Birthday.”
Jimmy’s move in G
If you had to play in the key of G, and you wanted to throw in the Jimmy Reed 
move, it would look like Figure 3-9. This move has a different character and 
is a little easier to play than the same move in E (discussed previously). The 
chord diagrams in the figure are presented above the staffs, so you can view 
the move as either a new chord inserted between the ones you already know 
or as just simply moving a finger over to play a previously open string on 
beats 2 and 4.

In the Jimmy Reed move in G, you have to mute the open string that 
your finger just left to play the new chord (indicated by an X in the chord 
diagram).
Jimmy’s move in A
The move travels up the neck of the guitar to grab the IV and V chords. This 
sound is very rock ’n’ roll (in a good way), and has a less folksy character 
than the G progression. The blues move in A has an entirely different feel 
than the same move in G, yet they’re only one letter away — the basis for 
Chuck Berry’s sound and for much of the “boogie” rock ’n’ roll played by 
rockabilly artists of the ’50s, ’60s, and today.
The sound of sadness: Minor blues
For a different flavor of blues, consider the blues in a minor key setting. 
Minor keys in music sound sad or menacing or mysterious, and what better 
way to give the blues a double dose of trouble than to put it in a minor key? 
Putting the blues in minor also provides some variety. A minor blues doesn’t 
say much about the form, only that it uses minor chords instead of the usual 
major or dominant-7 chords. A minor blues can be a 12-bar blues with minor 
chords or a straight-eighth (or non-shuffle feel), 16-bar format (instead of the 
more common 12-bar format).
“St. James Infirmary” and “The Thrill Is Gone” are two minor blues songs. 
“The Thrill Is Gone” is a popular format for more contemporary blues, and 
Figure 3-10 shows a progression more along the lines of this song. Notice the 
addition of minor 7th chords, which help give a jazzier feel.

Accessorizing the 12-Bar Blues: Intros, 
Turnarounds, and Endings
Intros (short, of course, for introductions), turnarounds, and endings are all 
enhancements to the 12-bar blues. They’re used to steer the song toward 
repeats or resolutions and are all related. There are countless variations 
for these three devices, and they’re often reworked versions of each other, 
where the only difference is how they end.
Intros
An intro often features a solo lick by the guitar, piano, or other instrument 
(think of “That’ll Be the Day” by Buddy Holly). But sometimes the whole band 
plays the intro, and the guitar is expected to play rhythm guitar (licks and 
riffs are covered in Chapter 4 in Book IV).

319
 Chapter 3: Blues Progressions, Song Forms, and Moves
Book IV
Blues 
Guitar
Intros often borrow from their turnaround cousins, because the whole idea is 
to set up the I chord and the beginning of the progression — the same duties 
that the turnaround has.
Figure 3-11 shows a basic two-bar intro. The rhythm features a syncopation 
and then a held note, which creates a musical space (or hole) before the 
downbeat of the 12-bar progression. This space allows room for a vocal or 
instrumental melodic pickup — a phrase that starts before bar 1.

2-bar intro.

Figure 3-12 is a four-bar intro that is just the last four bars of the 12-bar blues. 
This intro is popular and is often announced by a musician saying, “Let’s 
bring it in from the V,” or “Let’s walk it down from the V.”

Turnarounds
A turnaround bar is a bar, as mentioned earlier, that substitutes a V chord 
for a I chord in the last bar of the progression — bar 12 in a 12-bar blues (see 
“Playing the 12-bar blues” earlier in this chapter). A true, full turnaround 
is, at minimum, a two-bar phrase that goes from the I chord to the V chord. 
Note: Entire books could be written on just turnarounds, but this section 
covers only a few rhythm approaches.
Figure 3-13 shows a simple two-bar turnaround using the Jimmy Reed move 
and syncopation.

Endings
Endings are closely related to turnarounds, except for the last part of the 
last measure. The last measure terminates on a I chord of some type. Figure 
3-16 shows an ending that a slow blues often uses — a 9th chord for the final 
chord of the piece.

High Moves
All the moves covered earlier in this chapter take place on the lower strings. 
But you can play them on the higher strings, too. These strings often involve 
the same notes that are played in the lower strings (the 5th and 6th of the 
chord featured in the Jimmy Reed move — covered in “Applying Structures 
to Keys” earlier in this chapter), but when played up high, it sounds more like 
a riff than a chord figure. This creates a bridge between chord figures and 
riffs and licks.
Think of these new, higher moves as chord forms added to your basic eighth-
note strumming. As you play these added chords, notice that the sound pro-
duces a melodic motif. Figure 3-18 shows the first high-note move in the key 
of E. The two added chords are E7 chords with your fourth finger of the left 
hand playing notes on the second string.

Now add two chords to the A7 chord sequence. The notes are the same rela-
tive ones you added to the E7 chord — the 6th and the 7th. Figure 3-19 shows 
the fingering with the added notes played by the fourth finger of the left hand.

For the B7 chord, in Figure 3-20, the fourth finger again plays the added note, 
but because the finger is already in place — on the 2nd fret, 1st string — you 
must move it up to the 3rd fret briefly. This may seem a bit awkward at first, 
and the stretch between your fourth and third fingers may take a while to get 
smoothly, but it will come in time.
 
Figure 3-20: 
The B7 
move.

Figure 3-21 shows all three moves in a 12-bar blues. If some of the moves 
seem difficult, or come too fast, try leaving them out at first. As long as you 
don’t break the rhythm in your right hand and you change left-hand chords 
where you’re supposed to, the blues still sound fine. That’s the beauty of the 
blues: You can play any variation on the basic structure — from simple to 
complex — and it always sounds good.

Blues Riffs: The Bedrock

 Mastering the basics: Single-note riffs

 Taking your skills to the next level: Mastering rhythm figures
I
t can be tough to find your own blues voice because you can’t randomly 
improvise the blues any more than you can make up baroque or bebop; 
you have to learn the vocabulary in order to improvise. And the vocabulary 
for blues includes licks and riffs.
Although related to chords, riffs aren’t tethered to chords the way the 
rhythm-based approach is (Chapter 2 in Book IV discusses blues rhythm). 
It’s always good to know where your riffs spring from — especially if they’re 
derived out of a chord form. But you don’t need to grab a chord first to play a 
riff. In this chapter, you play riffs with a liberated left hand.
When you learn chords, strumming, double-stops, and single-note riffs, you 
have most of the ingredients necessary to start really developing as a player. 
In the blues, cloning the greats and doing your own thing is always a delicate 
balance.
Basic Single-Note Riffs
A riff is a self-contained musical phrase, and it can be used to form the basis 
for a song. Riffs are the bridge between chords and lead guitar. They’re 
usually based on single notes, but they can involve double-stops (two notes 
played simultaneously) and bits of full-chord playing.

326
Book IV: Blues Guitar 
 
You may hear the terms riff and lick used interchangeably in your blues 
guitar career. But try to think of a riff as more of a structural, repeatable 
phrase, and a lick as a cliché — that is, a self-contained lead figure that 
doesn’t necessarily have structural importance (like those short, snappy 
melodic phrases played by blues and country guitarists between vocal lines).
The signature guitar parts in the Rolling Stones’ “Satisfaction” and the Beatles’ 
“Day Tripper” are classic examples of riffs. In blues, the crisp, ascending, 
horn-like melodic bursts in Freddie King’s “Hide Away” are riffs, as is the 
repeating pattern in Bo Diddley’s “I’m a Man.”
In the next few sections, you look at riffs in order of increasing rhythmic activity, 
starting with quarter notes, advancing through eighth notes (the straight, shuf-
fle, and triplet varieties), and moving to the more complex 16th-note–based and 
syncopated riffs (which involve eighths and 16ths). Just as you do when playing 
chords, you must play riffs with a solid and consistent approach to articulation 
(attack), rhythm, and dynamics (overall loud and soft) to help keep the drive in 
the guitar part.
 
Use a metronome to help keep yourself playing along with the beat, and use 
a combination of your ears and muscle memory to make sure you strike the 
strings with the same force for achieving consistent dynamics.
For the low-down bass notes: 
Quarter-note riffs
You may think you can’t do much to groove hard with the boring ol’ quarter 
note, but the quarter note drives a lot of boogie-woogie bass lines. Boogie-
woogie and blues are close cousins, and you can always throw in a boogie 
bass as a variation to almost any medium- to uptempo shuffle. Figure 4-1 
shows a common quarter-note boogie pattern that you can play easily with 
just downstrokes.

The big daddy of riffs: Eighth-note riffs
Most riffs in blues are eighth-note based, so there’s a wide range of music you 
can play in an eighth-note groove. But to start off, jump into eighth-note riffs 
by taking quarter-note riffs (from Figure 4-1) and doubling them up — that is, 
play two notes per beat instead of one. Figure 4-2 is a boogie-bass pattern in 
shuffle eighth-notes.

Shuffle (qr=qce)
Another popular riff is the stop-time feel. It features the low notes of the 
guitar. The entire band plays a figure in unison and stops at the downbeat 
of each measure in the phrase, like in “Blue Suede Shoes.” This approach 
is used famously in the Muddy Waters tunes “Mannish Boy” and “Hoochie 
Coochie Man.” A tribute to the stop-time riff is featured in Figure 4-3.

Adding a little funk: 16th-note riffs
Funky blues usually sound that way because 16th notes are in the mix. In a 
16th-note groove, the tempos tend to be moderate. But because the beats use 
16th-note subdivisions, the groove sounds quite active. Often the bass line 
and drums (particularly the hi-hat) employ 16th notes to lend support to the 
scratchings laid down by the guitar. Figure 4-5 is a 16th-note riff on the low 
strings that you play with strict alternate (down-up-down-up) picking.

Throwing rhythm for a loop: 
Syncopated eighth-note riffs
Although syncopation isn’t a huge influence in the blues (compared to, say, jazz, 
R&B, and funk), it’s used sometimes and is always a welcome treat. (For more on 
syncopation and its mechanisms, flip to Chapter 2 in Book IV.) Figure 4-6 shows a 
syncopated blues line consisting of a dotted eighth, a tie, and 16th notes.
 
If you’re practicing the syncopation in Figure 4-6 and it gives you trouble at 
first, try practicing the line without the tie (so you’re playing both notes in 
the tie). Then, when you’re confident with the figure, practice the tie by let-
ting the note ring through.

Double the Strings, Double the Fun: 
Double-Stops (Two-Note Riffs)
Riffs aren’t restricted to single notes. In this section, you get to explore 
double-stops — a technique that doesn’t strictly involve single notes. The 
term double-stop means two strings.
 
A double-stop applies to all string instruments when two notes are stopped 
or played together. Even when guitarists don’t have to fret a string, they 
still refer to simultaneous two-string playing as double-stops. But more than 
just playing two strings (like in the Jimmy Reed figure covered in Chapter 
3 in Book IV), double-stop playing implies moving in lock step — and even 
performing bends, slurs, and vibrato (sliding fretted notes back and forth to 
make them waver up and down in pitch) on two strings at once.
Part of the versatility of a two-note figure is that it can be played on any two 
strings — low, high, and in the middle — all for a slightly different effect. 
When you get tired of playing chords and single-note leads, a two-note riff 
can be just the ticket to give your playing (and your listeners) a much-needed 
dose of dual-string diversity.
The 5-6 riff is a blues-rhythm hallmark of going from the 5th to the 6th degree 
in a chord (such as E to F# in an A chord) and is technically a double-stop, 
although the string motion doesn’t proceed in parallel motion. But the right-
hand  coordination is the same: You strike two strings as if they’re one every 
time your right hand comes in contact with the strings. The 5-6 riff is also 
known as the Jimmy Reed move (see Chapter 3 in Book IV). The following 
sections cover two 5-6 riffs, each in a different feel.

Book IV: Blues Guitar 
Straight feel
Straight-eighth notes are unusual in blues. But in blues-rock, classic rock ’n’ 
roll, and rockabilly — all closely related to the blues — the straight-eighth 
feel rules. Straight eighths are spaced equally apart, whereas shuffle eighths 
follow a long-short scheme.
Figure 4-7 uses linear movement instead of the more static, back-and-forth 
5-5-6-6-5-5-6-6. Also think of the riff to Roy Orbison’s (and later Van Halen’s) 
“Oh, Pretty Woman” for a classic straight-eighth approach to a low-note riff.

Many eighth-note riffs sound equally good in a shuffle or straight-eighth feel. And 
in many early rock and R&B recordings, such as Chuck Berry’s “Johnny B. Goode” 
and “Carol,” you can actually hear some instruments playing straight eighths and 
others playing shuffle eighths. Try the passage in Figure 4-7 in a shuffle feel to see if 
it translates. Some riffs will work, and some won’t. You don’t really know until you 
try, and there’s no harm in that, even when it doesn’t work out.
Shuffle, or swing, eighths
Most blues are in a shuffle feel, and shuffle-based eighth-note riffs (also 
called swing eighths) are the most popular and numerous types of blues riffs. 
Countless tunes employ eighth-note riffs, including such hits as “Dust My 
Broom,” and “Sweet Home Chicago.” Figure 4-8 shows you a classic shuffle 
rhythm that employs swing eighths and the occasional eighth-note triplet.

High-Note Riffs: The Bridge 
to Lead Blues Guitar
A high-note riff is very close — in words and in music — to a lick. But if 
you’re mastering all that low-note stuff, you deserve to see what awaits you 
when you ascend the cellar stairs into the sunshine of high-note, melodic-
based playing.
Keith Richards’s borrowed trademark: 
Quick-four riffs
A quick four (in this section) refers to a double-stop riff that you play on the 
second and third strings within a measure of a I or IV chord. (Don’t get this 
quick four confused with the kind of quick four that happens in bar 2 of a 
12-bar blues, covered in Chapter 3 in Book IV.) When you play this riff during 
a chord, you create a temporary IV chord.
The Rolling Stones’ Keith Richards carved out a very successful career 
exploiting this riff, and he learned from the great American blues masters. 
Figure 4-10 shows a four-bar phrase where the quick-four riff is applied at the 
end of each bar of an E and A chord.
 
Keith Richards’s signature riffs in Stones classics like “Brown Sugar,” “Honky-
Tonk Women,” and “Start Me Up” are actually in open-G tuning, which makes 
the quick four easy to access. Open tunings in G, A, D, and E were used exten-
sively by prewar acoustic guitarists — such as Charlie Patton, Son House, 
and Robert Johnson — especially for slide.

Intro, turnaround, and ending riffs
Intros, turnarounds, and ending riffs fill out the chord structure with melodic 
figures. As you play the figures in this section, try to hear the underlying 
structure — the rhythm guitar in your mind — playing along with you. You 
can play the chords according to the chord symbols above the music, but in 
this case the symbols identify the overall harmony and don’t tell you what to 
actually play at that moment.
 
Intro, turnaround, and ending riffs have very similar DNA, so they can be 
mutated ever so slightly to change into one of the other two functions. You 
can easily adapt and add your own flavor to the examples (in the figures) 
in this section, so take a stab at converting the intro in Figure 4-11 into an 
ending that borrows from Figure 4-16. These practices get you used to taking 
other people’s ideas and fashioning them into your own. That’s how pre-
existing riffs and licks get turned into an individual and original voice.
Intro riffs
Figure 4-11 is a snappy, triplet-based intro riff. The lower voice descends 
while the top voice stays fixed. Try playing this riff fingerstyle or with a pick 
and fingers.

Figure 4-12 is related to Figure 4-11 in that the lower voice descends against a 
fixed upper-note. But here, the notes are played together as double-stops for 
a more obvious and dramatic harmonic clash of the two notes. This blues lick 
and the one in Figure 4-13 are borrowed from a famous pop song — Johnny 
Rivers’s version of Chuck Berry’s “Memphis.” Play this lick fingerstyle or with 
pick and fingers.

The varying motion of the riff in Figure 4-13 makes it unpredictable and dra-
matic. The figure shows an all-single-note riff in triplets, ending in a B7 chord 
that comes on beat 2. The melody here changes direction often and can be 
a little tricky at first. But we’re confident you’ll get the hang of it with some 
practice.

Figure 4-16 is an open-chord turnaround riff in C — the key for fingerpicking 
country blues like Mississippi John Hurt. The last chord is a treat: a jazzy G7 
augmented (where the 5th of the chord, D, is raised a half step to D#), which 
gives the progression a gospel feel with a little extra flavor.

Combining single notes and chords
One way to get the best of both worlds — the 
lead and rhythm worlds, that is — is to com-
bine single notes and chords. Many blues 
players don’t make clear distinctions between 
chord playing, riff playing, or lead playing. 
Their technique just melds aspects of all these 
approaches into one cohesive style. And many 
of them do this while singing! Here are two 
examples:
  Stevie Ray Vaughan was a master of this 
style. He created full-sounding, active, and 
infinitely varied parts under his vocals as 
well as when he was just vamping along 
with the band.
  Eddie Van Halen, when in rare blues-mode 
(as opposed to his tapping, metal rock-god 
mode), was also an excellent practitioner 
of the integrated single-note-and-chord 
approach.
Today’s students of the guitar tend to look at 
rhythm versus lead guitar as a black-and-white 
issue. But the history of blues shows that, until 
the advent of modern rock (from about the late 
1960s on), players didn’t really think of guitar-
playing in those terms.
Be sure to also listen to the traditional players 
who sang and accompanied themselves on 
guitar:
  Robert Johnson
  John Lee Hooker
  Mississippi John Hurt
You hear the best examples of how to combine 
single notes and chords in those players’ styles, 
and the musical playing is some of the best you 
may ever hear.

Ending riffs
Ending riffs are similar to both intros and turnarounds, except ending riffs 
terminate on the I chord, not the V. Figure 4-17 is a triplet-based riff in 6ths, 
where the second string isn’t played.

You can play this riff with just the pick, but it’s easier with fingers or a pick 
and fingers. The open B string on the last triplet of beat 1 gives you a bit of a 
head start to get your hand up the neck to play the F9–E9 ending chords.
Figure 4-18 is a low note ending in E, using triplet eighths and a double-stop 
descending form. This riff is meaty and doesn’t sound too melodic because it 
has more of a low, walking bass feel.

Mastering the Rhythm Figure
After you have a handle on the components of rhythm guitar — left-hand 
chords, right-hand strums, riffs, and combinations thereof — it’s time to put 
them all together in various ways.
Here you can master the rhythm figure, which combines the components of 
rhythm guitar. In some musical circles, a rhythm figure — usually longer than 
a riff — describes any repeatable passage of music that forms the basis for a 
song or section of a song.
Rhythm figures can be as simple as a quarter-note chord strum, an eighth-
note boogie pattern, or a wild hybrid containing everything but the kitchen 
sink, as evidenced by the complex, integrated rhythm work of Magic Sam, 
Freddie King, Jimi Hendrix, and Stevie Ray Vaughan.
Figure 4-19 is a 12-bar blues that uses chords, single-note bass runs (to bring 
you in and out of those chords), and single-note riffs that go into flights of 
blues fancy.

Blues Genres: Acoustic, Electric, 
and Blues-Rock
In This Chapter
 Hammering out Delta, Piedmont, folk and country, and slide guitar blues
 Getting heavy with electric blues
 Checking out blues-rock, Southern blues, and the future of the blues
A
coustic-guitar blues is one of the earliest forms of blues. Before acous-
tic blues developed into its own instrumental style, the guitar was just 
a convenient instrument to play and accompany yourself while you sang. A 
performer naturally played rhythmically when singing and more melodically 
in between the vocal phrases. So the guitar style was woven into the singer’s 
approach to accompanying himself on the guitar. Gradually, the guitar went 
from being just a background instrument into a solo, unaccompanied instru-
ment and then evolved into the different branches of ragtime, country blues, 
and even rockabilly.
In this chapter, you take a grand tour of where the blues has gone in its long, 
illustrious journey, beginning with Delta blues, Piedmont blues, country and 
folk blues, and slide guitar, through electric and blues-rock, and ending with 
a few of the great up-and-coming blues players of today.
Delta Blues: Where It All Began
The famous Delta is an area of northern Mississippi and Arkansas that was 
agriculturally and musically fertile. When people refer to the “Delta blues,” 
they describe the music specific to a geographic region and the hard-edged, 
acoustic blues played by Charlie Patton, Son House, and especially Robert 
Johnson — its most famous and influential practitioner, who contributed 
some of the best recorded examples.

340
Book IV: Blues Guitar 
Understanding the Delta technique
The Delta blues style is an acoustic, self-contained approach (rhythm and 
lead combined) used almost exclusively as accompaniment for a singer. The 
thumb and fingers often play different parts. The thumb plays either steady 
quarter notes or a shuffle-eighth-note rhythm, especially when the high notes 
are laying out. The Delta blues liberally uses the minor pentatonic scale. (For 
more on the minor pentatonic scale, see Chapter 3 in Book III.)
Figure 5-1 is a 12-bar blues in the Delta blues style. The thumb hammers out 
either quarter notes or shuffle eighths. In the spaces where the vocal rests, 
high notes are introduced as melodic fills.
 
Many Delta players use thumbpicks for extra power. For more rhythmic 
playing, thumbpicks are especially appropriate, even if you don’t normally 
use them. The more experienced players try to incorporate licks and subtle 
chordal flourishes while keeping an insistent bass going.

Robert Johnson (1911–1938) is universally recognized as the “King of the 
Delta Blues,” and for good reason. His influence is felt not only through those 
who followed but also in every student who picks up the guitar with a mind 
to play the blues. Johnson influenced many aspects of the blues — through 
his playing, his songwriting, and his aura. No performer has led — or was 
alleged to have led — a more mythic or legendary blues life. Some people 
believe that Johnson gained his talent in a deal with the devil; he died young 
and under mysterious circumstances, and his songs are haunting with chill-
ing themes about the devil and death.
If you’ve grown up with blues as interpreted by B.B. King, Eric Clapton, Stevie 
Ray Vaughan, and other modern electric-blues masters, hearing the scratchy, 
raw recordings of Johnson can be quite startling. Johnson’s thin, keening 
voice, his twangy guitar, and his sometimes irregular meter and quirky phras-
ing are definitely an acquired taste. But when you make the adjustment, the 
genius of him in these stark settings is awe-inspiring.
Robert Johnson’s music embodied the Delta blues in its finished state. And 
there was no end to Johnson’s innovation. He played with a slide and with-
out, in altered tunings as well as standard, and he shifted from accompani-
ment to a featured guitar style effortlessly. Only one solo break of Johnson’s 
talent exists on recording. To hear Robert Johnson play his only known 
recorded solo break, check out “Kind Hearted Woman Blues.”

Book IV: Blues Guitar 
Johnson played his brand of blues in many keys and in many different tun-
ings, but he’s known for his work in the key of open A. Figure 5-2 shows a pas-
sage in standard tuning that Johnson frequently used for intros, turnarounds, 
and endings. The lick in Figure 5-2 is similar to others that are covered in 
Chapter 3 in Book IV in the key of E. (Don’t worry if you haven’t looked at 
that chapter yet.) This figure uses a device called oblique motion — a fancy 
term for when one voice stays the same (the top) and another moves (the 
lower, descending).

Johnson’s style was complex and hard to pin down. Some of his stylistic hall-
marks include the following:
 
 An insistent bass in quarters and shuffle-eighths
 
 Up-the-neck chords
 
 Chromatic movement
Did Johnson sell his soul to the devil?
Almost certainly not. Robert Johnson wasn’t 
always referenced with the devil. The myth only 
began in 1965 after blues scholar Pete Welding 
interviewed Son House. House talked about the 
amazing progress Johnson made on the guitar 
in such a short time and said, “He must have 
sold his soul to the devil to play like that.”
Eric Clapton and his band Cream perpetu-
ated the myth, perhaps inadvertently, when 
they changed Johnson’s opening lines of 
“Crossroads Blues” from “I went to the cross 
road — fell down on my knee. I asked the Lord 
above, ‘Have mercy — Save poor Bob, if you 
please’” to “‘I went down to the cross road, fell 
down on my knees, saw the devil. I went up and 
I said, ‘Take me if you please.’”

Johnson is one of the few Delta blues players known for his influential song-
writing (Willie Dixon, the bass player and performer, is another) and for 
contributing to the blues repertoire with such standards as “Sweet Home 
Chicago” and “Crossroads.” Besides composing two well-known hits with 
“Kind Hearted Woman Blues” and “Terraplane Blues,” many of Johnson’s 
songs are also historically significant.
The Piedmont Blues: Country Ragtime
The Piedmont blues feel is achieved by an alternating bass, where the bass plays 
on every quarter note, with accents and a root-fifth scheme on the first and 
third beats. This variation lends a two-beat, or boom-chick, sound. The sound of 
Piedmont blues is joyous and happy and is generally played more uptempo than 
Delta blues. The bouncy ragtime syncopations of ragtime piano — and espe-
cially the independence of the bass and treble voices — are often emulated in 
Piedmont blues, which further enhances its infectious, upbeat sound.
Practitioners of Piedmont picking include Blind Blake, Blind Boy Fuller, Barbecue 
Bob, Reverend Gary Davis, and Blind Willie McTell. Blind Willie McTell (1898–
1959), one of the most famous early practitioners from the early Piedmont 
school, was a virtuoso 12-string guitarist. His “Statesboro Blues” from 1928, 
though neither his best nor most famous song, is a modern classic as the driv-
ing, electric shuffle version recorded by the Allman Brothers Band on Live at the 
Fillmore East in 1971 (the band had learned it from a Taj Mahal record).
Geographically, the “Piedmont” in Piedmont blues refers to the area quite 
a bit east of the Mississippi Delta, between the Appalachian Mountains and 
the Atlantic coastal plain, stretching from Richmond, Virginia, to Atlanta, 
Georgia. Piedmont is often called country ragtime because of its lively, driving 
flavor. This ragtime is different from the piano ragtime of Scott Joplin that 
you may be familiar with. Ragtime in Joplin’s time was played straight with-
out the shuffle feel of country ragtime.
Figure 5-3 shows the driving, two-beat feel, accomplished through an alternat-
ing bass. This method is sometimes called Travis picking, after country per-
former Merle Travis, whose alternating thumb technique was widely popular 
(see the later sidebar “Country and folk blues had a baby: Rockabilly” for 
more on Travis). In this passage, in the key of C, the blue notes E% and B% 
figure prominently.
 
After you practice Figure 5-3 a few times, throw in some variety and mute the 
lower strings to add contrast between the bass and treble voices. This varia-
tion is performed on the accompanying CD.

Country and Folk Blues
For acoustic blues that isn’t clearly Delta or Piedmont — or that may have 
elements of both — you can use the adjectives country and folk. In this case, 
country means old-time country, as in non-urban. It has nothing to do with 
Nashville, sequins, or Dolly Parton, but a lot to do with mountain hollers and 
shotgun shacks. Folk blues is more of a labeling convention, where certain 
performers, like Leadbelly, were considered folk musicians because they 
sang folk songs.
The repertoire that comprised country and folk blues was often just a loose 
mix of folk and popular songs that were given a bluesy treatment by blues-
influenced performers. These performers often made no distinction between 
what was blues or not; they just played songs from any genre that suited 

345

Book IV

Guitar
their performance style. Audiences didn’t notice, either. For example, no 
one could have led a more emblematic blues life than Leadbelly, yet his best 
known song was a waltz-time folk ditty called “Irene Goodnight.”
Country and folk-style blues often includes an instrumental melody, usually 
syncopated on top of an alternating bass line. The guitar imitates the piano-
based ragtime style of Scott Joplin’s days. The key of C is the favorite for many 
country and ragtime blues songs. Ragtime chords in the key of C include E7, 
A7, D7, and G7, all of which fall nicely in open position and offer fingerpickers 
many options for bass runs, open strings, hammer-ons, and pull-offs.
For the audiences that found the Delta sound a little too dark or stark, coun-
try and folk music brought more tuneful melodies with a bluesy treatment 
that was more enjoyable. People who brought about this mix included Mance 
Lipscomb, Big Bill Broonzy, Reverend Gary Davis, and Mississippi John Hurt. 
Like Piedmont blues, these styles feature a lively, relentless, alternating bass 
line, and the songs themselves are drawn more from the folk repertoire than 
from the 12-bar blues arena.
The best way to understand country and folk blues is to listen to these styles. 
Songsters like Mississippi John Hurt wrote with a bouncy ragtime style and 
recorded famous songs such as “Candy Man Blues” (full of double meanings), 
“My Creole Belle,” and “Make Me a Pallet on Your Floor.” These lively songs 
featured Hurt’s ingenious ragtime work and had a good blues backstory.
Figure 5-5 is a song that features a melody on top of an alternating bass pat-
tern, similar to Mississippi John Hurt’s style. Pay attention to the way his 
confident, driving bass notes (played with the thumb) contrast the high-note 
syncopated melodic figures (played with the fingers).
Country and folk blues had a baby: Rockabilly
An important offspring of country blues was the 
hard-driving, alternate-bass sound that came to 
be known as rockabilly. The style featured blues 
figures but at a supercharged pace and with a 
heavy backbeat (provided by a prominent drum 
sound) and often a heavy use of effects, such 
as reverb, slap-back echo, and tremolo.
Merle Travis was a rockabilly pioneer, along 
with Scotty Moore (Elvis Presley’s first guitarist) 
and James Burton (Elvis’s second guitarist). 
Travis didn’t invent the alternating bass sound 
of rockabilly, but he popularized his own hard-
driving approach that featured a I-V-I-V bass 
motif in an uptempo two-beat feel, called Travis 
picking. Travis and his many followers, includ-
ing Chet Atkins, Doc Watson, Leo Kottke, and 
Jerry Reed, made this a staple sound in acous-
tic playing, and it works well in upbeat blues.

Quintessential Blues: Slide Guitar
Slide guitar may have become a stylistic choice over fretted guitar out of neces-
sity by players who didn’t have the skills or patience to fret the guitar and 
found it easy to slide a smooth, rounded object over the strings to achieve 
a similar effect. But for the greatest practitioners, such as Charlie Patton, 
Sylvester Weaver, Blind Willie Johnson, Son House, and Robert Johnson, slide 

347
 Chapter 5: Blues Genres: Acoustic, Electric, and Blues-Rock
Book IV
Blues 
Guitar
guitar was an unparalleled mode of expression evocative of the human voice 
as well as the wail of train whistles — a sound near and dear to country blues 
guitarists. Slide guitar is a staple of the acoustic blues guitar sound, unlikely to 
ever be imitated by synthetic, digital means.
The tools that let you slide
Early, rural-dwelling slide players used anything they could find to produce 
the slide effect. The edge of a pocket knife, a length of pipe, a section of bone 
from a ham or beef shank, or a medicine bottle were among some of the top 
“tools” used. The most popular and effective was a broken bottle neck (filed 
or fired to eliminate the sharp edges). Slide blues guitar is sometimes called 
bottleneck guitar.
These days, you’re likely to acquire your slippery weapon of choice by going 
to a music store and selecting from the prepackaged slides in the display case:
 
 Metal slides, especially those made from brass, are heavier (they have 
more mass), bolder sounding, and provide better sustain, but they’re 
more difficult to master.
 
 Glass slides are light and have a rounder, mellower tone.
The sliding technique
Many Delta players combined slide technique with fretting, often having the 
slide play the melodic portions while their fretting fingers played chordal 
 figures or kept the bass line going. This technique dictated the wearing of the 
slide on the fourth finger (the pinky). Follow the steps below to perfect your 
slide technique:
 
1. Slide an object like a glass or metal tube over a left-hand finger (usu-
ally the third or fourth).
 
2. Rest the slide on the strings (not pressed down), directly over the 
fret wire.
 
 Resting the slide on the strings and playing over the fret (instead of 
behind it as you do when fretting) takes a little finesse, but eventually, 
your intonation (the ability to play pitches in tune) and tone (the right 
pressure that produces rattle-free sustain) will improve.
 
3. Change pitch by gliding the slide along the string.
 
 This process produces a smooth, continuous change in pitch (some-
times called a glissando, or portamento, which is more correct).

348
Book IV: Blues Guitar 
 
At first, your slide playing may sound clangy and rattly as you move the slide 
around. You can improve your sound by using one of two techniques:
 
 Dampening (or muting), which involves placing your unused left-hand 
fingers lightly on the strings behind the slide (toward the nut)
 
 Employing right-hand palm mutes
 
Slide guitar is physically easy in one sense. You just drag a slide over the 
strings, and you can instantly hear the effect, right? Well, it can be difficult to 
get it under control to play in tune and keep the accompanying buzzing and 
rattling artifacts to a minimum. Slide guitar doesn’t require left-hand strength 
the way normal acoustic guitar playing does, but it does require finesse. 
Focus on intonation first, rhythm second, and dampening third. Also, it can 
be instructive to check your intonation with an electronic tuner — an advan-
tage you have over someone like Robert Johnson.
Tuning for slide guitar
Slide guitar can be played in standard or open tunings, but standard may 
be easier because your melodic instincts don’t have to be translated to the 
altered tuning of the guitar. However, in standard tuning it’s quite a challenge 
for a beginning slide guitarist to mute the unwanted strings that can create a 
sour, dissonant sound, as opposed to the chordal harmony of open tunings. 
So standard tuning presents more of a technical challenge, while open tuning 
presents a “thinking” challenge as you translate your instincts to fit a differ-
ent tuning. The solution? Play both ways! The following sections explain what 
you need to do.
 
Open tunings favor the technical side of common blues licks. And the main 
tunings, open E and open A (which are the same, relatively speaking, as open 
D and open G), each have their specific idiomatic licks. Don’t press too hard 
when applying the slide or the strings will buzz against the fret wire and fin-
gerboard. Try to keep the rattle noise to a minimum when going from open 
strings to slide-stopped strings.
Standard tuning licks
Standard tuning and open E tuning both feature the root of the chord on the 
top string and an interval of a 4th between the 1st and 2nd strings. The lower 
note is the 5th of the chord and makes for powerful-sounding licks, as Figure 
5-6 shows. The passage isn’t difficult, and the slide doesn’t do that much. But 
what it does is very effective, even in small doses.
The lick in Figure 5-6 is the characteristic sound of one of the most famous 
slide sounds of all time: “Dust My Broom” — a song originally by Robert 
Johnson with conventional fretting but covered in the most famous version 
by electric slide player Elmore James.

Open E and open D tuning
Open tunings have many technical advantages over standard tuning. The 
most prevalent is that an open tuning provides a major chord across all six 
strings, so holding the slide straight across at any fret yields a chord on any 
set of strings.
Open E (E, B, E, G#, B, E, low to high) is close to standard tuning because the 
top two strings are tuned the same, and many blues slide licks lie well in this 
tuning, because they require only slight movement of a couple of frets above 
or below to play an entire passage.
Open D is the same as open E but tuned a whole step (two frets) lower (D, A, 
D, F#, A, D). Elmore James and Duane Allman (one of the greatest blues-rock 
slide guitarists and founder of the Allman Brothers Band) played in open E. 
Figure 5-7 shows a typical lick in open E.

Open A tuning
In open A, the strings are tuned E, A, E, A, C#, E, low to high. The root of the 
chord on the 5th string provides a major chord on the top three strings. 
Having a minor 3rd interval between the top two strings allows for some idi-
omatic blues moves, especially the chromatic descending lick in 3rds.
The Birth of Classic Electric Blues
Early electric guitars, even ones with pickups, weren’t much different from 
acoustic guitars in construction, but gradually the manufacturing approaches 
diverged to produce two entirely different species. And along with the evolution 
of the electric guitar, so followed the electric blues guitar player’s technique.
Today, of course, the electric guitar in blues (as it is in other genres) is far 
more popular than its older, acoustic counterpart. Think of the biggest blues 
guitar names playing today — Eric Clapton, B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Bonnie 
Raitt, Robert Cray. All are electric blues players. The acoustic-blues players 
of today — Rory Block, John Hammond Jr., Taj Mahal, Keb’ Mo’, Corey Harris, 
Roy Book Binder, and Bob Brozman — are no less talented, but don’t enjoy 
household-name status.
The rise of the electric guitar in blues
At first, early electric guitarists simply played the way they always played 
when playing acoustic and appreciated the benefits of not having to play 
harder to play louder (instead they just turned up the amp). But as tech-
niques developed, players began to understand that the electric was an 
entirely different instrument from the traditional acoustic, or “Spanish” 
guitar. Musicians started adjusting their techniques — and their whole 
approach to music — to suit the new medium. With a guitar that could hold 
its own with other principal instruments on the bandstand, guitarists now 
focused more on melodic and lead playing.
When pickups were developed, guitarists leapt at the opportunity to have 
at least a fighting chance to be louder. The new electrified sound allowed 
guitars to take the spotlight as the featured instrument. Searing slide solos, 
sustained string bends, and a more instrumentally virtuosic approach were 
the order of the day, fueled by restless musicians anxious to infuse this previ-
ously rural sound with urban postwar energy.

351
 Chapter 5: Blues Genres: Acoustic, Electric, and Blues-Rock
Book IV
Blues 
Guitar
 
Increased sustain is probably the number-one advantage of electric guitars, 
allowing long, fluid, horn-like melodic lines. Overdriving an amp into distor-
tion creates the illusion of even longer sustain because the signal is clipped 
and compressed, with a steady volume level until it decays.
The earliest electric pioneer: 
T-Bone Walker
 
Although electric guitarists became a dime a dozen after electrics became 
affordable, one name stands alone as the early voice of electric blues guitar: 
T-Bone Walker. He is one of the most influential blues guitarists of all time 
because he bridged the gap from acoustic country blues into the urbanized, 
electric sounds of Memphis, Kansas City, and Chicago. Walker’s style and 
musical sensibilities were sophisticated and jazzy, and he was a versatile and 
skilled musician. He incorporated jazz-type harmony and phrasing in his play-
ing, using 9th chords in his rhythm playing and crafting lead lines that were 
melodically and rhythmically complex.
Figure 5-8 shows a passage in the style of Walker’s “Call It Stormy Monday” — 
his own tune and one where he really stretched out, taking the blues to places 
other melodic players of the day had never been. He achieved this end by 
throwing in unusual (for the time) string bends, jazzy phrases, and a har-
monic sophistication his Delta counterparts would hardly recognize. But it 
was all grounded in the blues vocabulary.

Walker influenced countless players, including Muddy Waters, Eric Clapton, 
Otis Rush, Magic Sam, Buddy Guy, Albert King, Albert Collins, Freddie King, 
and B.B. King. His showmanship, such as playing the guitar behind his head, 
was also imitated by many players.
Electric Blues’ Sweet Home: Chicago
Many people think they know what Chicago blues is, but the more they dis-
cover the diverse influences, overlapping associations, time periods, and 
even the geography of the city, the more they realize what an open issue the 
notion of Chicago blues is. Still, if you just try to enjoy the music without 
engaging in too much analysis, you realize how important the Windy City is 
to the development of the blues.
Before World War II, important performers included Big Bill Broonzy, Tampa 
Red, and Memphis Minnie, who played electrically and acoustically. In the 
postwar period — and after T-Bone Walker’s electric influence was felt by all 
who heard him — the Chicago scene, fueled by an influx of southern talent, 
took off. Table 5-1 shows some of the important blues guitarists who called

The fertile postwar Chicago scene had several players, led primarily by the 
bigwigs in the following sections.
Muddy Waters, leader of the pack
Born in Jug’s Corner, Mississippi, in 1915, Muddy Waters (birth name McKinley 
Morganfield) came north to Chicago in 1945 and became the leader of Chicago’s 
South Side blues scene. A large and imposing man, Waters dominated the stage, 
the scene, and the entire city in all things blues. He had talented contemporaries, 
like Howlin’ Wolf and Sonny Boy Williamson II, but no single person is more asso-
ciated with the Chicago sound than Muddy. He had everything:
 
 A guitar style that included percussive, stinging single-note Delta riffs
 
 An aggressive, bone-chilling slide technique
 
 A big, raspy singing voice
 
 A commanding stage presence
 
 A long and prolific performing and recording career

He played acoustic in Mississippi and electric in Chicago, single-handedly 
leading the charge to bridge the two styles. Figure 5-9 shows an electric 
guitar passage in the style of Muddy.

Elmore James, slide guitarist 
extraordinaire
Elmore James was a Chicago-based blues player known for his electric slide 
work. James recast the signature lick from Robert Johnson’s “I Believe I’ll 
Dust My Broom” from conventional fretted playing to slide and recycled it 
many times in his other compositions. James’s techniques with an electric 
guitar and his explosive assault on the strings turned “Dust My Broom” into a 
piece of blues immortality (his version is known by the shortened version of 
the title). James’s slide lick is the first lick you need to learn; its importance 
is matched only by its accessibility, and it’s what’ll get you kicked out of the 
South Side if you don’t play it correctly. James’s “Dust My Broom,” performed 
in open D tuning (D, A, D, F#, A, D, low to high), is shown in Figure 5-10.

Otis Rush: A soulful player 
with a flair for vibrato
Born in Philadelphia, Mississippi, in 1934 as one of seven children, Otis Rush 
learned to play the guitar left-handed and upside down, like Albert King. Rush 
Magic Sam, a man who marched 
to the pluck of his own pick
Magic Sam (birth name Sam Maghett) was born 
on February 2, 1937, in Grenada, Mississippi, 
and was one of the architects of Chicago’s 
West Side sound. Sam played in a unique style, 
a punctuated fingerpicking approach, dosed 
with amp tremolo and exhibited in such tunes as 
his debut single, “All Your Love.” His nickname 
“Magic” derived from his last name. For many, 
Sam’s one-of-a-kind style, great voice, and sin-
gular performing persona made him the favor-
ite of the West Side. Tragically Sam died at age 
32 of a heart attack and didn’t enjoy the fame 
and notoriety of some of the other figures of his 
time, such as Buddy Guy and Otis Rush.

Book IV: Blues Guitar 
was exposed to Muddy Waters and Howlin’ Wolf, but he also listened to B.B. 
and Albert King, who deeply influenced his lead approach. His first single, 
Willie Dixon’s “I Can’t Quit You Baby,” made it to the top ten on Billboard’s 
R&B chart.
“I Can’t Quit You Baby,” as well as the rhumba-flavored “All Your Love” and 
the minor-key songs “Double Trouble” and “My Love Will Never Die,” show 
Rush’s smooth, soulful single-string work and stinging vibrato.
Buddy Guy, the father of blues-rock
Buddy Guy, more than his contemporaries, seemed to foreshadow the blues-
rock movement through his stage show. (Blues-rock is covered in more detail 
later in this chapter.) He played loudly and infused his playing with whammy-
bar antics, distortion, and feedback. Guy influenced the early British blues-rock 
greats Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, and the Rolling Stones, and toured the United 
Kingdom in 1965, sharing a bill with the Yardbirds. Stevie Ray Vaughan once 
said, “Without Buddy Guy, there would be no Stevie Ray Vaughan.”
 
Guy is perhaps the single most important performer (trained by Waters and 
Howlin’ Wolf) to bridge the Chicago sound with blues-rock. Through his excep-
tional talent and longevity, he has become a living legend whose albums have 
won Grammy Awards, and he’s received the praises of later greats such as Eric 
Clapton, who calls Guy his “favorite blues axe man.” Figure 5-11 is a passage 
that captures the essence of Buddy Guy’s fiery and virtuosic style.

The Blues Sounds of Texas
As the blues grew up, it developed its own regional flavors beyond the already 
established locales of the Delta and Piedmont. So of course, Texas, being such a 
large and diverse state, has a sound and culture all its own when it comes to the 
blues. Of all the big blues regions, Texas, by virtue of its size and blues hotspots 
like Austin, Houston, and Dallas, still retains a meaningful connotation.
And speaking of the Lone Star State, when you say “Texas shuffle” to people 
attuned to the regional dialects of the blues, they instantly think of the many 
attributes of the shuffle:
 
 Rhythm: The rhythm section swings harder, influencing the lead guitar-
ists’ approach to their solos.
 
 Swing: The Texas shuffle has more swing than the slow grind of a Delta 
blues or the bouncy ragtime of the Piedmont.
 
 Harmonic richness: This genre also has a wider variety of notes (the 
major 3rd, major 6th, and chromatic neighbor tones) than the minor 
pentatonic or six-note blues of Delta players.
Any great blues musician knows a Texas shuffle. Figure 5-12 is a solo in a 
Texas shuffle setting. It incorporates a wide vocabulary of notes in the lead 
part. Note the liberal use of the sweet notes — the major 3rd and major 6th of 
the chords underneath.

Book IV: Blues Guitar 
Famous early performers to come out of the Lone Star State include Blind 
Lemon Jefferson, Lightnin’ Hopkins, T-Bone Walker, Clarence “Gatemouth” 
Brown, and Albert Collins. They performed vastly different music from one 
another, but all are connected through history and influence. A later genera-
tion of Texans includes several of the all-time greatest blues players of the 
post-Chicago heyday.
Johnny Winter, a Texas blues-rock titan
Blues-rock guitarist Johnny Winter exploded out of Texas in 1968 and pro-
ceeded to become one of the top concert draws of the early ’70s. Winter was 
a virtuosic soloist who played with a thumbpick, and his speedy leads lit up a 
number of gold albums.
You can hear him trade red-hot blues leads with co-guitarist Rick Derringer 
on the 1971 cover of B.B. King’s “It’s My Own Fault.” To play like Winter, 
develop the best blues vocabulary you can and work on making any phrase 
fit in any groove — straight, shuffle, or 16th-based, fast and slow.
Billy Gibbons and ZZ Top
The power trio ZZ Top is a powerful mix of Texan music and the blues. Guitarist 
Billy Gibbons isn’t a high-speed player like Johnny Winter, but his slow, smolder-
ing solos helped set the standard for “soulfulness” in the rock guitar world.
 
Gibbons is a masterful blues player with a well-rounded playing approach, 
but he’s best known for his edge-of-the-pick (also known as pinch) harmonics. 
To play a pinch harmonic, follow these steps:
 
1. Grasp your pick so only a small piece of the tip can be seen from 
between your thumb and index finger.
 
2. Just as you strike the string, give the pick a little forward twist, almost 
digging into the string and touching the flesh of your finger to the 
string, to stop or mute it slightly.
 
 This technique takes some practice and getting use to, but the resulting 
note should have a harmonic (a high, bell-like sound resulting from the 
string being partially stopped) in it.
 
3. Add plenty of distortion to help the effect “read” better.

Gibbons’s fat lead tone is legendary among rock players. He’s particularly 
famous for using a flametop 1959 Gibson Les Paul Standard lovingly named 
“Pearly Gates,” as well as a pink late-1950s Strat given to him by Jimi Hendrix, 
which greatly contribute to that tone. But did you know that he doesn’t pick 
with a plastic piece, but with a real Mexican peso? Just a cool fact to know.
Stevie Ray Vaughan, the greatest 
modern bluesman of them all
Austin’s legendary Stevie Ray Vaughan burst into the spotlight in 1983, first 
on David Bowie’s Let’s Dance album, and then on his solo debut, Texas Flood. 
Stevie Ray could channel Jimi Hendrix’s Strat attack — he would often per-
form “Voodoo Child (Slight Return)” and “Little Wing” as a tribute — but he 
developed his own style that brought the Stratocaster back as the definitive 
blues-rock instrument.
Vaughan blew minds with both a blistering blues technique as well as the 
fattest guitar tone imaginable. He achieved his tone by using a combination of 
classic Fender, Marshall, and Dumble tube amps, pumped up with an Ibanez 
Tube Screamer TS-808 overdrive pedal, as well as a vintage Strat set up with 
heavy-gauge strings. He also tuned down a half-step, which contributed to his 
sound’s girth.
Stevie Ray died in a helicopter crash in 1990, just after performing with Eric 
Clapton, but young guitarists are still mystified at how he achieved his one-
and-only Strat sound, heard in such classics as “Pride and Joy,” “Crossfire,” 
and “The Sky Is Crying.”
Vaughan’s playing style was unique, evolved, and identifiable, with an inte-
grated chord-and-single-note approach for rhythm as well as over-the-top 
lead playing that sounded on the verge of losing control (which he never 
did). To emulate the style of Vaughan, put heavy strings on your guitar, 
build up your arm strength, and combine melodic licks and riffs with open-
position, jazz, and barre chords. (Listen to Figure 5-13 to hear how Stevie 
also threw tasty little chordal riffs into his solos — a hallmark of Texas blues 
guitar.) You must also play with complete authority, whipping off rhythm fig-
ures and lead lines with equal abandon.
 
Stevie Ray’s brother, Jimmie Vaughan, is also an extraordinary blues guitar-
ist, known for his work with the Fabulous Thunderbirds.

Four Blues Giants: Three Kings 
and a Collins
Beyond the important regions, cultural developments, and trends in blues, 
individual performers often launch a trend in music. You’d be hard-pressed 
to find any single more influential individuals than the four giants of blues 
guitar covered in this section.
Albert King, the upside-down 
string bender
Mississippi-born, Arkansas-raised Albert King was a big man who squeezed 
the strings of his guitar into heartfelt submission. Because he played left-
handed, upside-down guitar (where the low E string was closest to the floor), 
Albert’s style was unorthodox, especially his approach to bending strings. 
He pulled the strings of his signature Gibson Flying V down toward the floor, 
which in part accounted for his unusual, expressive sound.
When Albert King was living in St. Louis in the late 1950s and then Memphis, 
he recorded for Stax Records and enjoyed real success, gaining visibility in 
both the blues and rock arenas. His soulful sound and R&B arrangements 
produced his best-known songs of the era, including “Laundromat Blues,” 
“Cross Cut Saw,” and “Born Under a Bad Sign,” all of which placed on the pop 
charts. King influenced many guitarists, including Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, 
Mike Bloomfield, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Robert Cray.
B.B. King, the blues’ king of kings
If you know only one name in the blues, it’s probably B.B. King. B.B. is the 
rightly anointed, undisputed king of the blues. He has a deep, historical con-
nection to the Delta performers and trod the early club circuit in the south-
ern United States.
Born Riley B. King in 1925 in Indianola, Mississippi, B.B. King began to gain 
 success in his early 20s in his adopted town of Memphis, playing clubs and 
appearing on radio. His on-air persona was “the Beale Street Blues Boy,” 
eventually foreshortened to “B.B.”, and he started recording in earnest in 
1949 (only one year after Muddy Waters made his first recording in Chicago). 
B.B. soon had his first national R&B hit with “Three O’clock Blues” in 1951.

362
Book IV: Blues Guitar 
 
Burning for Lucille
Lucille is the name B.B. King gives his main 
guitar (now a Gibson B.B. King signature edi-
tion, modeled after the ES-355). The story goes 
that King was playing in an Arkansas club 
when a fight broke out between two men over a 
woman. During the brawl a pail of kerosene that 
was being used to heat the club was knocked 
over, setting fire to the room. After escaping 
outside, King realized that he had left his guitar 
inside and rushed back into the burning club, 
risking his life to retrieve his axe. He later 
learned that the name of the woman the men 
had been fighting over was Lucille, and so King 
named his guitar Lucille and has since named 
many of his guitars in her honor.
B.B. King has it all: a soulful delivery, chops to burn, a vast vocabulary of 
blues licks in a variety of genres, and an inexhaustible reservoir of expressive 
techniques. He’s perhaps most often cited for his vibrato, which is effortless 
and heart-rending. Figure 5-14 shows an example of how B.B. executes his 
brand of vibrato over a minor blues. To play like B.B., work to make every 
vibrato count, no matter how brief. That means applying a different intensity 
(rate of bend and depth of bend) to the note, based on the tempo and feel of 
the groove.
 Freddie King, a two-pick man
Freddie King was a Texas-born guitarist who played with a plastic thumb-
pick and a metal fingerpick, in a two-finger fingerpicking style that he said he 
learned from Muddy Waters sideman Jimmy Rogers and Jimmy Reed sideman 
Eddie Taylor. His early influences included Lightnin’ Hopkins and saxman/
jump blues star Louis Jordan, but he’s influenced others, too: Jeff Beck, Keith 
Richards, Jerry Garcia, Peter Green, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, and John Mayer.
Freddie’s family moved from Texas to Chicago in 1950, when he was 16, and 
there he sneaked into clubs to hear the greats of that era: Muddy Waters, 
Howlin’ Wolf (who took a liking to him), and Elmore James. He began record-
ing as a sideman in the ’50s while working in a steel mill.
Freddie King’s best-known song is the instrumental “Hide Away,” recorded in 
1961, which was covered by John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton, 
and Stevie Ray Vaughan — and every blues cover band in North America and 
Europe. Following the success of this tune, which placed on the pop charts as 

363

Guitar
well as the R&B charts, Freddie followed up with more instrumentals, includ-
ing “San-Ho-Zay,” “The Stumble,” and “Side Tracked.”
Figure 5-15 shows a lick in the style of Freddie King’s “Hide Away.” Keep the 
approach light and crisp, as Freddie did, and play “on top of” (or slightly 
ahead of) the beat to capture his sound.

Albert Collins, master of the Telecaster
Albert Collins was an accomplished showman and a fierce guitarist. Born 
in 1932, in Leona, Texas, he received his initial musical training on the 
keyboards, but he soon picked up the guitar and started hanging out in 
Houston clubs and absorbing the influence of his Texas-based idols, Clarence 
“Gatemouth” Brown, Lightnin’ Hopkins (a distant relative), T-Bone Walker, 
and John Lee Hooker.
Albert Collins concocted a unique recipe for playing guitar, consisting of a 
Fender Telecaster, a capo (which was often strapped on at the 5th, 7th, or 
even 9th frets), unorthodox tunings, and a stinging fingerstyle approach that

fairly snapped notes out of the guitar. The essence of Albert Collins’s style 
was his aggressive attack, piercing sound, and staccato phrasing. Plus he 
often tuned to an open minor chord.
Albert Collins had a string of instrumental hits in the late ’50s and early ’60s 
whose titles all had a “chilled” theme to them (“The Freeze,” “Sno-Cone,” “Icy 
Blue,” and “Don’t Lose Your Cool”). These songs earned him the nickname 
“The Iceman.” In 1962, he released “Frosty,” which became a big hit.
Blues-Rock and Southern Blues
The year 1965 was one of the most important years in popular music history. 
It was the year of Bob Dylan’s “Like a Rolling Stone,” and the Rolling Stones’ 
“Satisfaction.” For guitarists, it was also the beginning of a vast blues revival. 
Suddenly, mid-’60s electric guitarists on both sides of the Atlantic began re-
exploring the blues and the roots of rock ’n’ roll, along the way inventing an 
exciting, influential genre called blues-rock.
What traditional electric blues gave to the emerging style of blues-rock was 
widespread use of string bends and finger vibrato in composed melodic lines 
and improvised solos. Before the influence of blues, rockers in the ’50s could 

366
Book IV: Blues Guitar 
buy only heavy-gauge guitar strings, but ’60s blues-rockers learned how to 
bend new, lighter-gauge strings, develop a strong vibrato, and hold long, sus-
tained notes. These blues techniques gave rock guitar leads a more human, 
vocal-like quality.
This new level of expression also gave birth to the “guitar hero.” By the end 
of the 1960s, guitar gods like Eric Clapton, Michael Bloomfield, Jimi Hendrix, 
Jeff Beck, and Jimmy Page had become the gold standard of blues-rock cur-
rency. But these guitarists went beyond just bending strings — they also 
employed high-powered amplifiers, such as the fabled Marshall stack, to play 
blues guitar at previously unheard-of volumes, and infused their tone with 
tube overdrive, fuzzbox distortion, and the deep funk of wah-wah pedals.
When rock ’n’ roll began in the mid-1950s, it was essentially a blend of R&B 
and jazz chord changes with country rhythms. Later, pop entered the genre 
via catchy tunes and more sophisticated lyrics. But the blues had only a 
negligible influence in a world of sweet and boppy melodies of the day — 
until one very stylish, duck-walking performer burst onto the scene: Chuck 
Berry. And following Berry was a whole movement of first British and later 
American artists who brought the blues to the world’s screaming teens.
You can read about Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, 
Jimmy Page, and other bluesy rock guitarists in Chapter 6 in Book III, which 
focuses more on rock than blues. Here, though, you can read about a decid-
edly more bluesy type of rock: southern rock.
Like the blues itself, there are few forms of popular music as quintessentially 
American as southern rock, which hails largely from the southeastern corner 
of the United States (notably Georgia and North Florida). Launched by the 
Allman Brothers Band, southern rock was the purest blues-rock sound ever 
created. The genre melded blues, country, gospel, and heavy rock. In all, the 
’70s southern rock sound had dozens of hot blues-rock players: The Outlaws 
(“Green Grass and High Tides”); The Marshall Tucker Band (“Can’t You See”); 
and the fusion-fueled Dixie Dregs, featuring bluesy guitar virtuoso Steve 
Morse (“Take It Off The Top”).
The Allman Brothers (especially Duane)
The original Allmans featured two excellent guitarists, Duane Allman and 
Dickey Betts. Both men could play the heck out of a 12-bar blues, but in 
Duane’s brief career, he shined most on slide guitar (see Figure 5-16 for a 
slide solo, Allman-style). Allman’s stylistic hallmarks were rapid up-and-down

slides into and out of eighth notes, plus a penchant for throwing in large, 
unexpected melodic leaps to keep listeners on their toes. His exceptional 
slide work can be heard all over the famous At Fillmore East live album from 
1971, especially on the blues masterpiece “Statesboro Blues.” He died shortly 
thereafter, but his slide work was so ahead of its time that he set the bottle-
neck standard for the next 25 years.

Lynyrd Skynyrd
Lynyrd Skynyrd became the next southern supergroup, thanks to the 1974 
smash, “Sweet Home Alabama.” Skynyrd had three fine guitarists: Ed King, Gary 
Rossington, and Allen Collins. Rossington and Collins can be heard tearing up 

368
Book IV: Blues Guitar 
the concert favorite “Freebird.” King is notable for a squealing, edgy tone (thanks 
to an electronic compressor) and for punching up the blues bends dramatically. 
King’s solo in “Freebird” is inspired, yet controversial, because many claim that 
it’s “in the wrong key.” The song (whose first chord is D) is actually in the key of 
D. King himself admitted that he approached the solo as if it were in G, but most 
people agree the song is in D. Yet the solo seems to work anyway, and the song 
and King’s solo both go down in history as one of the great events for guitar.
Blues in the 21st Century
Today’s music scene may be dominated by computers and digital downloads, 
but happily, blues-rock, like traditional electric blues, has carved out a path 
and proceeds on its journey into the 21st century.
John Mayer and other new 
kids on the blues block
Among the brightest lights of the new millennium is singer-songwriter John 
Mayer, who fuses the best of Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan into a 
stunning Strat style. Listen to “Route 66” from the Cars film soundtrack to 
hear this young picker play a joyous blues solo and throw down a wad of 
chunky chord work.
A few other young guns of modern blues worth checking out include the hot-
pickin’ Joe Bonamassa (“Travelin’ South”), Kenny Wayne Shepherd (“Blue on 
Black”), and Henry Garza of Los Lonely Boys (“Heaven”). Coincidentally, or 
not, all of them play Fender Stratocasters, just like their blues-rock idols, Jimi 
Hendrix, Eric Clapton, and Stevie Ray Vaughan.
Allman Brothers redux: Warren Haynes 
and Derek Trucks, keepers of the flame
More than 35 years after their debut, the Allman Brothers are still a top con-
cert draw, and the band’s guitarists — Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks — 
have a huge part in the group’s success.
 
 Haynes, who’s been in the band longer than Duane Allman was, is a 
wizard at both straight soloing and the Duane Allman-style slide. To play 
slide like Haynes, keep your guitar in standard tuning and transcribe all 
Duane’s moves (who played in open E) into standard tuning.

 Trucks, meanwhile, has taken bottleneck to a whole new dimension, infus-
ing it with Indian music and bebop jazz influences from sax legend John 
Coltrane and trumpeter Miles Davis. You can hear both Derek and Warren 
just tearin’ it up on “Firing Line” from the Allman Brothers album Hittin’ 
the Note. To play like Trucks, you need to wear a slide and brush up on 
your bebop vocabulary. (If you want to check out Coltrane and Davis, get

rom its very beginning, the guitar took to classical 
music. Vast swaths of the various periods of classical 
music turn out, in fact, to be quite playable on classical 
guitar. After it was invented, composers began scribbling 
pieces exclusively for the new instrument.
A classical guitar isn’t the same as a regular acoustic, and 
it’s not played the same way. This book gives you the 
scoop on the world of classical guitar music, which has 
developed separately from Western pop music but is cer-
tainly no less accomplished, to say the least.

T
he first thing you have to sort out is just what’s meant by the term classical 
guitar. It can describe both a type of instrument and a style of music played 
on it. When referring to the instrument itself, you’re talking about a guitar that 
has a particular design and construction, is made of certain materials, and 
requires playing techniques that are unique to it, as compared to other guitars. 
To mine the depths of all the tonal and textural richness that await you in the 
world of classical guitar music, you must employ specific right- and left-hand 
techniques, which together comprise the classical guitar style.
A Brief History of Classical Guitar
The guitar is a relatively young instrument, having evolved to its present 
form in the 19th century. As such, it doesn’t have the rich body of music 
available for it that, say, the violin does, which has been around for more 
than 500 years. But the classical guitar has been, how shall we say, industri-
ous in the way it has “borrowed” music from other instruments to claim as 
its own. As a result, studying classical guitar means playing a lot of music 
that wasn’t written for the guitar, by composers who wouldn’t recognize the 
instrument. That’s just part of the adventure of being a guitarist; you have to 
be somewhat of a pioneer with your instrument.
Nowadays composers write for the instrument all the time, ensuring its con-
tinued place in the field of serious musical instrument study. Many guitarists, 
associations, and organizations commission well-known composers to write 
compositions for the guitar in the same way that Beethoven and Mozart were 
commissioned to write symphonies and sonatas.

374
Book V: Classical Guitar 
Some well-known composers from the 20th century who’ve written for the 
guitar include Heitor Villa-Lobos, Luciano Berio, Benjamin Britten, Elliott 
Carter, Peter Maxwell Davies, William Walton, Alberto Ginestera, Ástor 
Piazzolla, and Leo Brouwer. After taking a while to come into its own, the 
classical guitar is now a permanent member of the classical music com-
munity. Classical guitar is taught in universities and conservatories, it’s a 
frequent program entry for concert and recital halls, and it’s found readily in 
new recordings by major classical music record companies. As far as guitar 
music in general goes, however, it’s definitely in the minority — with rock 
and pop being the major players.
How a Classical Guitar Is 
Different from Its Peers
They say a picture’s worth a thousand words. Figure 1-1 shows a classical 
guitar with its main parts labeled (you see many of these parts on acoustic 
and electric guitars, too; flip to Chapter 1 in Book I for details).

A classical guitar is like every other guitar in overall physique. And like 
other types of acoustic guitars, the classical guitar produces its sound 
acoustically — that is, without electric amplification — unlike

the Stratocaster of Jimi Hendrix, which must be played through a guitar 
amplifier (though it’s possible to amplify the classical guitar with a 
microphone).
 
Watch out when you hear the term acoustic guitar. A classical guitar produces 
its sound without amplification, so all classical guitars are in a sense acoustic 
guitars. But not all acoustics are classical.
Sometimes the best way to know what something is and what makes it spe-
cial is to know what it isn’t. Figure 1-2 shows a classical guitar and a popular 
traditional acoustic model.

Classical guitar
Acoustic guitar
The following list sums up some of the major differences between classical 
guitars and acoustic guitars:
 
 A classical guitar uses nylon strings. All other acoustics used for 
unplugged purposes are built for steel stings. And you can’t just swap 
out a set of nylons in your steel-string model and start playing Bach. 
The parts that connect the strings to the guitar are built differently, 
and you’d have a tough time securing a nylon string onto a steel-string 
guitar. Nylon strings have a gentler sound that suits classical guitar 
music better than the steel variety.

376
Book V: Classical Guitar 
 
 Some people use the adjective folk to mean any unamplified guitar, so 
it’s always a good idea to clarify whether they mean the nylon-string 
(classical) or steel-string variety — assuming they’re aware of the differ-
ence. The guitars played by James Taylor, Paul Simon, Bob Dylan, Joni 
Mitchell, Dave Matthews, and Sheryl Crow are all steel-string acoustics, 
though some folk, pop, and jazz musicians do play their brand of music 
on a classical guitar, including jazz guitarist Earl Klugh and, somewhat 
improbably, country music legend Willie Nelson.
 
 Though the instrument is officially known as a classical guitar, other 
nicknames have sprung up for the “instrument played by classical gui-
tarists.” Some of these names include nylon-string guitar, Spanish guitar, 
gut-string guitar, and flamenco guitar (though that last appellation is 
sometimes used to distinguish a flamenco guitar from a classical guitar).
 
 A classical guitar has only one body size. Acoustic guitar bodies vary 
widely with regard to size and shape, with names like jumbo, dread-
nought, orchestra model, and grand auditorium to help you keep track of 
them all. It’s much easier with classical guitars — they’re all the same 
size, and they all feel exactly alike when you hold them. So anything you 
learn on one classical guitar will transfer over to any other.
 
 A classical guitar has no cutaway. Many acoustic guitars have a scoop 
on the treble side of the upper bout that allows upper-fret access for the 
left hand. On a classical guitar, the body is symmetrical.
 
 A classical guitar neck is wider than most steel-string guitar necks and 
joins the body at the 12th fret. Steel-string necks are skinnier to facili-
tate strumming with a pick, and most modern-style steel-string necks 
join the body at the 14th fret. The wider frets of the classical guitar 
accommodate playing with the right-hand fingers, and tradition dictates 
the 12-fret union of neck and body (although some classical guitarists 
lament the more limited range of a 12-fret neck).
 
 A classical guitar has no pick guard. A pick guard helps protect the 
soundboard from the ravages of a pick. But because you don’t play clas-
sical guitar with a pick, the pick guard is left off to expose more of the 
wooden surface. On flamenco guitars, though, a clear protective plate 
(called a golpeador) is added to protect the top from the percussive taps 
a performer is sometimes required to play as part of the style.
 
 A classical guitar has no fret markers. Acoustic guitars have inlay pat-
terns both on the fingerboard and on the side of the neck. Sometimes 
these inlays can be quite elaborate, even gaudy. But classical guitars 
shun such showy displays and present the fingerboard in its natural, 
unadorned state. Occasionally, a classical guitar may have a single dot 
fret marker on the side of the neck.
 
 A classical guitar never has the following images painted or stickered 
onto its surface: skulls, lightning bolts, flames, your significant other’s 
name, or inflammatory slogans of any kind.

Beyond Physique: Other Unique 
Attributes of Classical Guitar
The most fundamental difference is that classical guitar is acoustic and 
played on a nylon-string guitar — but you could say that about other styles 
and other performers. (Willie Nelson is just one famous example of a nonclas-
sical nylon-string guitar player.) So you have to dig deeper into the essence 
of classical guitar. In the following sections, you discover some of these key 
differences — in terms of the approach to the instrument — between classi-
cal guitar and other acoustic guitar styles.
Form and technique
Classical guitar requires that you hold the guitar and position your hands 
in a certain way (as you find out later in this chapter). Using these positions 
makes playing pieces easier, especially when you have to play up the neck or 
play notes with certain right-hand strokes to achieve the full tone of classical 
guitar music. The most important factors are how you hold the guitar, how 
you place your hands in playing position, and how your right-hand fingers 
pluck the strings.
Antonio Torres: Inventor of the modern 
classical guitar
Plucked string instruments have been around 
since ancient times, but the shape that all 
modern classical guitar makers follow was 
established by a luthier (guitar maker) named 
Antonio Torres (1817–1892), who lived in Spain 
and built guitars in the middle of the 19th cen-
tury. Up until that time, a classical guitar could 
be found in a range of sizes, which affected 
the tuning and entire approach to playing the 
instrument. For the guitar to be accepted, it had 
to be standardized, and Torres did that. In fact, 
an 1863 Torres-made guitar is almost indistin-
guishable from ones built today.
One of the most important things Torres did was 
establish the string length at 650 millimeters, 
which hasn’t changed. The string length has 
helped to determine other things: body pro-
portions, neck length, and the guitar’s overall 
dimensions. Many bold makers have tried alter-
nate shapes and materials and added strings, 
but no one has successfully improved on the 
basic design of Torres’s creation.
Modern improvements have been made, of 
course, especially in the manufacturing pro-
cess and in some of the materials (such as 
synthetic substitutes for the bone or ivory nut 
and saddle, and better alloy chemistries for the 
metal tuning parts). But the woods and design 
have remained largely unchanged since Torres 
codified them back in the mid-1800s.

378
Book V: Classical Guitar 
Holding the instrument
You can hold an acoustic guitar a number of different ways: balanced on your 
right leg, balanced on your left leg (either between your legs or with your 
left leg crossed over your right), or dangling from a strap when you’re stand-
ing up. But the classical guitar is played only in a sitting position, supported 
by the left leg — either with the left foot elevated or with a special support 
device (a cushion or frame) between the inner thigh and the guitar’s body.
Placing your hands in position
In other styles, you can position the right hand in several ways, and no one 
will correct you as long as you sound good. But in classical guitar, you must 
hold your right-hand fingers perpendicular to the strings, without touching 
any other part of the guitar (such as the top and the bridge). You must also 
position your left hand so the knuckles farthest from the fingertips are paral-
lel to the strings, not sloped away from the strings at the little finger, which 
some styles allow. And in classical guitar, the left-hand thumb stays braced 
at the center of the neck or can move toward the high strings, if necessary. 
But it should never be seen coming up from the bass-string side of the instru-
ment, as you see in some fingerpicking styles.
Plucking the strings
To produce sounds on the guitar, you pluck the strings with the fingers of 
the right hand at a position over the sound hole (actually, the ideal position 
is not directly over the hole, but a little closer to the bridge than the finger-
board). With the left-hand fingers, you change the pitches of the notes by 
pressing the strings to the fretboard — a process known as fretting — which 
shortens the strings’ vibrating length at a particular fret. (Violinists and other 
bowed string players don’t have frets, so they refer to pressing fingers to the 
fingerboard as stopping the string, a term guitarists sometimes use, too.)
Unlike other forms of guitar playing, in classical guitar, you don’t use a pick. 
All the sounds produced by the right hand are produced by the unadorned 
fingers, using the tips with a combination of the fleshy pad and a bit of finger-
nail (rarely strumming downward, or “brushing” them). The fingernail must 
extend slightly over the fingertip, and the guitarist must therefore maintain 
longer nails on the right hand than guitarists who play with a pick, or those 
who choose to fingerpick with just the flesh of the fingers.
 
Though classical guitar is played by picking with the fingers, the term finger-
picking isn’t used, as it sometimes is with other styles. So don’t ever call a 
serious classical guitarist a fingerpicker.

 Chapter 1: Introducing the Classical Guitar
Book V

Guitar
Musical knowledge and skills
Beyond perfecting the techniques necessary to execute classical music flaw-
lessly (or getting ever nearer to that goal), classical guitarists develop their 
music-reading skills to cover more repertoire. And having more and more 
pieces under your belt means you can perform for longer periods of time and 
with more variety when entertaining listeners. The best classical guitarists 
also are technically superior to players of lesser abilities (a quality which 
isn’t necessarily true in, say, pop music). The following sections outline why 
classical guitarists focus on improving their reading, mastering repertoire, 
and honing their technical skills.
Reading music
You can play many types of music without reading a single note. Certainly 
some of the best rock, blues, and folk players don’t read music well or even 
at all, and it doesn’t hamper their creative or technical abilities. But classical 
guitar relies on learning pieces, and the fastest, most efficient way to play 
through and memorize written music is to be able to read music well. That 
doesn’t mean you have to sight read at a level where you can play the music 
perfectly and up to tempo the first time, but you should be able to read well 
enough to get a sense of the piece. (See Chapter 4 in Book I for a quick lesson 
in reading music.)
Mastering repertoire
If you play the classical guitar, you play pieces — classical compositions or 
arrangements written out from start to finish, with the exact notes you’re to 
play indicated — and often the way to play them (with articulations, dynam-
ics, and expression). You have to know written, composed music from start 
to finish, and most of the time you have to play it from memory.
Focusing on technical skill, virtuosity, and musicianship
Other styles of music may focus on the originality of the material or the 
inspired results of an improvisation. But in classical guitar, the primary focus 
is on technical mastery of the instrument. You work and work at improving 
your skill constantly your whole musical life, and your prowess is measured by 
how well you play standard pieces of repertoire. Simply put, classical guitarists 
are measured in the same way athletes are: The best classical guitarists are the 
most demonstrably technically proficient over their rivals.
One measure of technical proficiency is virtuosity — the ability to play 
extraordinarily difficult pieces with complete confidence, ease, and mas-
tery. Along with technical prowess comes the not-so-showy quality called 

380
Book V: Classical Guitar 
musicianship, which is understanding and executing the music with great 
accuracy, authority, and expression. In this way, the classical guitar has a 
lot in common with other classical instruments.
 
Now, if all this sounds like a lot of rules that may somehow restrict you, take 
heart. The opposite is true. The differences between classical technique and 
other techniques actually enable you to play notes more comfortably, easily, 
and with greater speed, accuracy, control, and range of expression. It may 
seem like a lot of do’s and don’ts at first, but just as in ballet, architecture, 
and other art forms, you need to master the basic skills to open up a world of 
possibilities. To achieve total freedom of expression in playing classical 
guitar music, you first need to gain total control.
Situating Yourself to Play
Your first step in getting ready to play classical guitar is to make sure you’re 
holding the instrument correctly and with your hands in the proper position. 
Unlike other styles of guitar playing, where common sense and comfort are 
often the only guidelines, classical guitar requires you to hold and position 
the instrument in certain ways that allow you to play more smoothly and to 
master the more difficult fingerings you may encounter. But though these 
requirements are specific, they’re not difficult or restrictive in any way.
 
In proper position, a classical guitar makes contact with four points on your 
body. This allows you to keep a firm hold on the guitar while your hands 
enjoy the mobility they need to play freely. The four contact points support 
the guitar as follows (see Figure 1-3):
 
1. Resting on the left leg. This one’s easy, because gravity does all the 
work. Set the guitar on your raised left leg (or use a support, explained 
later in this chapter) and proceed to the other points from here.
 
2. Braced against the right leg. The lower side of the guitar presses 
against the inner thigh of the right leg. You can move your leg around 
a bit if you feel the corner (the spot where the back and sides meet at a 
90-degree angle) digging into your thigh in an uncomfortable way.
 
3. Touching the chest. The back of the guitar, just behind the bass side of 
the upper bout, should lightly touch the center of your chest.
 
4. Lightly touching your right arm. Your right arm rests, but doesn’t press 
tightly, on the side. Avoid pushing the underside of the forearm into the 
guitar’s top because that may impede its vibration and sound.

Taking your seat
Classical guitar is always played from a seated position. You never stand or 
kneel, or lie on your back, as some showoff rock guitarists do, and you never 
use a strap. In fact, a classical guitar doesn’t even have strap pins.
Before you sit down just anywhere to hold the guitar, you should know that 
classical guitar prohibits certain types of seating arrangements. For one, you 
can’t plop down on the living room couch or a beanbag chair. These two 
locations, as comfortable as they are for reading or messing around with 
other types of guitars, can’t put you in the proper playing position for dealing 
with classical guitar technique. What you need is a sturdy, armless chair. Any 
kind of armless chair will do the job, including a dining room chair, a straight-
back chair, a stool, or even a folding chair.
 
The chair you use should be relatively comfortable so you can spend long 
periods there without getting uncomfortable or risking strain or stiffness. If 
you use a normal metal folding chair, you may want to add a pad or cushion 
for comfort because you may be spending a good deal of time in that chair — 
especially if you want to get really good.

382
Book V: Classical Guitar 
Supporting the guitar: Leg position
Another thing you have to attend to is a means to elevate your left foot off 
the floor about 4 to 6 inches. This is usually done with a footstool that’s spe-
cially built for the classical guitarist. They’re not very expensive (about $25), 
and you can buy them at any music store. If you don’t have a footstool yet, 
just use a couple of hardcover books.
So to get started, find yourself a sturdy armless chair and sit toward the 
edge. Sit up straight with your legs slightly apart so you can set the waist 
of the guitar on your left leg. Place your foot on the footstool (or whatever 
improvised platform you have) and look straight ahead. Your position should 
look similar to that shown in Figure 1-4.
 
Figure 1-4: 
Seated in

An alternative to raising your leg is to use a specially made support or cushion 
on your left leg, which raises the guitar to the proper playing position while 
allowing you to keep both feet on the floor. Advocates of the support claim 
that it’s better for your back because it doesn’t require you to lift one leg in a 
sitting position, which causes strain. Figure 1-5 shows this alternate method, 

383
 Chapter 1: Introducing the Classical Guitar

using an adjustable support that braces against the inner thigh and cradles 
the guitar by means of a curved piece that matches the contour of the side 
of the guitar’s body.
 
Figure 1-5:

port raises 
the guitar

the left foot.
 
 
Some guitarists alternate the two, which mixes it up for the body, preventing 
them from having to maintain one position for too long. A guitarist may, for 
example, practice for two hours using the support, and then practice another 
hour with the footstool. Or he may choose to rehearse with the support and 
perform with the footstool. This is the approach we like, because although 
the support works, we like playing in the traditional way, too.
Embracing the guitar: Arm support
Classical guitarists don’t invest in all the doodads and gadgetry available for 
other types of guitarists, but occasionally a device or accessory comes along 
that becomes part of the classical guitarist’s bag of tricks. In addition to the 
support, another common external device you find is the arm rest. This fits 
on the guitar’s side, on the bass side of the lower bout, directly under where 
the right arm sits, as shown in Figure 1-6. The arm rest lifts the forearm off 
the guitar’s top, allowing the top to vibrate freely. Without the arm rest, the 
right arm inevitably touches the top. Because the arm rest prevents direct 
contact between the arm and the guitar, it also serves to prevent wear to the 
finish. Some arm rests lift the right arm off the instrument entirely, a benefit 
to big and tall players because it helps them maintain good posture and pre-
vents them from having to hunch over the instrument.

Placing your hands correctly
When you’re in the proper sitting position and feeling comfortable, it’s time 
to turn your attention to your hands. For now, all you’re going to do here 
is place your hands in the proper position for playing. Don’t worry just yet 
about actually making sounds. This is simply a check to make sure that your 
hands fall on the guitar in a natural, comfortable, and correct way.
The right hand
Assuming you’re seated with the guitar balanced on your left leg, place your 
right hand so it hovers above the strings over the sound hole. Actually, don’t 
center your hand directly over the sound hole, but slightly to the right of it, 
toward the bridge. Figure 1-7 shows how your right hand should look.

Let your right forearm touch the edge of the guitar on the bass side of the 
lower bout. Your hand should be loose and relaxed with your wrist bent, or 
angled, in a way to cause the fingers, if you were to outstretch them, to lie 
perpendicular to the strings, as shown in Figure 1-8. In some situations, you 
may relax this “absolutely perpendicular” approach, allowing your hand to 
look like the position back in Figure 1-3.
 
Figure 1-8: 
Angling 
your right 
hand so 
the fingers 
fall perpen-
dicular to 
the strings.
 
 
You should be able to pivot your right elbow so your right hand pulls away 
from the guitar without the guitar moving or going out of balance.
 
Try wiggling your fingers in the air above the strings. If you feel tension in 
your forearm muscle, you may be pressing your arm against the guitar’s top 
too tightly. You don’t need to hold the guitar in place with your right arm, so 
try lightening up a bit. The right arm and hand should almost float above the 
guitar and strings. And no part of your right hand should rest on the top of 
the guitar. All of your fingers should dangle freely above the strings. Make 
sure your shoulders are relaxed as well.
The left hand
When your right hand is in position, turn your focus — and your head — left. 
With the guitar balanced on your left leg, open your left hand slightly by sep-
arating the thumb from the fingers. Then slip your left hand around the neck 
and place your thumb on the center of the neck’s back, allowing it to rest 
lightly there. Position your left-hand fingertips to press down on the strings 
on the top of the fingerboard. Figure 1-9 shows how your left hand should 
look from the back.
Turning your attention to the fingerboard side of the neck, check to see that 
the knuckles farthest from the fingertips are more or less parallel to the 
strings. Figure 1-10 shows the fingers arched and ready.

A good check to see if the guitar is well-balanced is to take your left hand 
completely away from the guitar. The guitar shouldn’t move at all because 
you don’t use the left hand to support the neck.
Approaching the Strings with Your Hands
In classical guitar, left-hand techniques are intuitive and natural — not 
much different from left-hand techniques used in other types of guitar play-
ing. In contrast, right-hand techniques are very specific and have to be 
learned, and they require you to not only position your hand so the fingers 

387
 Chapter 1: Introducing the Classical Guitar
Book V

Guitar
strike the strings at a perpendicular angle, but also to execute the notes 
using specific plucking methods, or strokes, called the free stroke and the 
rest stroke. The following sections walk you through these left-hand and 
right-hand techniques.
Fretting the strings: Left-hand form
Pressing the strings to the fretboard with the left-hand fingers is known as 
fretting. To fret a string, use a left-hand finger to press the string down to 
the fingerboard with just enough pressure to cause the string to ring clearly 
(without buzzing or muffling). To fret the strings as effectively and efficiently 
as possible, don’t place your finger squarely in the middle of the two fret 
wires; play a little closer to the higher fret (the one closer to the bridge). 
This gives you better leverage when pressing down on the string, meaning it 
requires less strength to produce a strong, pure sound. Pressing closer to the 
higher fret helps eliminate buzzing, too.
When fretting a note, approach the string from above, rather than from the 
side, to get the maximum downward pressure against the fretboard, and keep 
your fingers rounded (not flat or hyper-extended) by curling your knuckles. 
This best applies your finger strength to the tip and provides the most effec-
tive fretting. Curving your fingers also helps you avoid accidentally touching 
adjacent strings. And you may be relieved to know that the left-hand finger-
nails can be kept short! In fact, if you’re accustomed to having long left-hand 
fingernails, trim them to be flush with or below the fingertips.
Figures 1-11 and 1-12 show proper left-hand fretting technique.

Preparing to pluck: Right-hand form
Though you don’t have to start out with long right-hand fingernails, sooner or 
later you have to grow and maintain them to be able to effect the tonal varia-
tions necessary for classical guitar playing. All classical guitarists agree that 
combining the nail with the fleshy part of the fingertip to pluck the string is 
essential in deriving the full spectrum of tonal colors and achieving the wide 
dynamic range required for classical guitar music.
Preparing your right-hand fingernails for action
To get “good guitar nails,” let your right-hand fingernails grow so they extend 
about 1/16 inch beyond the fingertip. This measurement is only an estimate, so 
just be sure you’re able to get some of the nail in contact with the string when 
you pluck it. You may find it easier to keep your nails shorter as you’re first 
learning to use them, allowing them to grow longer as you develop control. Many 
players like to have a slightly longer thumbnail for added bass note authority.
It’s not enough just to have long fingernails. They also have to be properly 
shaped — that is, they should follow the shape of your fingertip — and you 
should keep them smooth and free of nicks and chips. To keep your finger-
nails at a consistent length and shape, care for them on a regular basis and 
invest in some “fingernail paraphernalia.” A two-sided diamond nail file or a 
multisurface emery board are good options. For more on nail care, see the 
nearby sidebar, “A guitarist’s guide to nail filing.”
Making a beautiful sound: The nail-flesh tone
Anyone who studies the classical guitar spends long hours perfecting the 
development of the nail-flesh tone because it’s such an inherent part of 
classical guitar technique and tone. Being able to combine the nail with the 

389

flesh (as shown in Figure 1-13) by angling the finger so more tip and less 
nail catches the string, in combinations that provide near-infinite degrees 
of tonal shading, is what makes the guitarist’s palette of right-hand sounds 
so rich.

A guitarist’s guide to nail filing
After your nails are long enough to give you 
some raw material to work with, follow these 
steps to shape and finish them so they can 
enhance your classical guitar tone (and they’ll 
look nice too):
 1. Use the coarse surface of the file or emery 
board to get the nails into a basic rounded 
shape. If you’re using a multisurface emery 
board, start with the roughest-feeling grit. 
File down excess length and then shape 
the nail’s edge to follow the contour of the 
fingertip in a symmetrical oval. Some clas-
sical guitarists recommend only filing in 
one direction to avoid tearing a nail. Check 
your progress frequently by holding your 
outstretched fingers in front of you, parallel 
to the wall, with your fingertips at eye level. 
Don’t worry — no one’s watching.
 2. Drag the file between the nail and the fin-
gertip to round out any rough surface on 
the underside of the nail.
 3. When the shape is curved and even, switch 
to a finer grit to smooth out any rough edges 
left by the coarser surface. Eliminating 
snags or rough spots will make your sound 
smoother as well as prevent snagging on 
clothing and other fabrics, which can cause 
the nail to tear.
 4. When you’ve filed the nails smooth, try 
using fine grit sandpaper (600 or finer) 
or the emery board’s finishing surface to 
make the nails even smoother, giving them 
an almost polished feel that protects them 
for longer periods between maintenance.

Stroking the strings: Basic 
right-hand technique
In a free stroke, you pluck the string in an upward motion, leaving the finger 
“free,” or dangling in the air, above the strings and poised to strike again.
The rest stroke is what classical guitar players use to produce strong, expres-
sive, and powerful notes — more powerful than those that can be obtained 
by the free stroke. The “rest” part refers to the finger coming to a stop, or 
rest, on the next string in the direction of the stroke. Rest strokes are played 
with the fingers more often than the thumb and enable you to give notes 
more power and volume than a free stroke. But rest strokes are less nimble 
than free strokes, so you use them on notes that don’t move quickly.
Many guitarists who first encounter free strokes and rest strokes often wonder 
when to use one or the other. See Table 1-1 for a handy list of which situation 
falls to the free stroke and which setting is a candidate for the rest stroke.

awkwardness and impracticalities in 
the right-hand fingering
Passages that must be drawn out from 
their surroundings (either other notes 
from the guitar or in an ensemble set-
ting), assuming no conflict with other 
strings
The free stroke
Playing the free stroke doesn’t involve any specific trick or technique. It’s a 
very natural way to play the guitar, and the way all styles of fingerpicking are 
performed. In fact, if you think about it too much, you may cause it to sound 
overly deliberate. Just pluck the string and do it several times to ensure an 
easy, natural approach.
To play a free stroke, place the index finger of your right hand on the 1st 
string. With a brisk motion, bending from the finger knuckle, pluck the string 
by drawing the finger toward the palm and slightly upward (being careful not 
to strike the 2nd string) so your finger ends up above the strings dangling 
freely, as shown in Figure 1-14.

Figure 1-14: 
Play a free 
stroke by

1st string 
and leaving

strings.
 
Repeat until you can play several plucks in a row smoothly. After you’re com-
fortable playing free strokes with your index finger, play free strokes several 
times in a row using your middle finger. Then with your ring finger.
You almost never use the little finger of the right hand in classical guitar, so 
next try playing free strokes combining the three fingers. For example, play 
index, middle, index, middle; then index, middle, ring, index, middle, ring; 
then middle, ring, middle, ring; and finally, index, ring, index, ring.
Playing a free stroke with the thumb is just like playing a free stroke with the 
fingers, except you move in the opposite direction. Place it on the 6th string 
(nearest the ceiling). Then push through the string, plucking it, and bring 
your thumb slightly upward toward your palm so you don’t strike the 5th 
string. Your thumb should end up above the strings, as shown in Figure 1-15.

of the free

392
Book V: Classical Guitar 
The rest stroke
A rest stroke always means coming to rest on the next adjacent string in the 
direction of the stroke. For the fingers, this means the next lower string in 
pitch (or next higher-numbered string). For example, if you play a rest stroke 
on the 2nd string, your finger rests on the 3rd string. Rest strokes must have 
a “place to park” after the string is played. Sometimes this creates a problem 
if the string underneath has to be played by the thumb or another finger, or 
if that string must be allowed to ring out from being previously plucked. In 
those cases, you must use a free stroke.
To play a rest stroke, plant your right-hand index finger on the 1st string. 
Then, in one motion, draw it back, plucking the string and following all the 
way through until your finger is stopped by the 2nd string. Be sure you don’t 
play through the 2nd string; if you do, you’re plucking too hard. It may help 
to think of drawing or pulling the finger downward into the guitar, rather than 
away from the guitar, as you do in a free stroke. Figure 1-16 shows the motion 
of the rest stroke.
 
Figure 1-16: 
Playing a 
rest stroke 
on the 1st 
string and 
then stop-
ping and 
resting on 
the 2nd 
string.
 
Because the rest stroke has a “landing string,” it’s a little more limited in its 
use than a free stroke is. For example, you can’t use the rest stroke for arpeg-
gios. But for bringing out a solo melody, nothing beats the expressive power 
of a rest stroke.
 
Playing rest strokes with the thumb is rare, though you sometimes play them 
this way to bring out a solo bass line or low-note melody. The principles for 
playing a rest stroke with the thumb are the same as with the fingers, except 
that your thumb moves in the opposite direction (toward the floor instead of 
the ceiling). To play a rest stroke with the thumb, plant your thumb on the 
6th string. Then push your thumb so it plucks the 6th string and follows 
through to the 5th string, where it stops.

The birth of modern stroking technique
Because they imbue classical guitar music with 
its unique flavor, the rest stroke and nail sound 
may seem like they’ve always been around, 
preordained or something. But the rest stroke is 
only a recent practice and one largely promoted 
by the mentor of classical guitar great Andrés 
Segovia, Francisco Tárrega (1852–1909).
The rest stroke gave guitarists a much more 
powerful way to extract notes from the guitar 
than the free stroke could muster. And while 
Segovia adopted, embraced, and perfected 
Tárrega’s rest stroke, he differed with him 
regarding the use of right-hand fingernails.
Tárrega and many others of the time were 
strongly opposed to using the nails. Emilio Pujol, 
a famous guitarist, composer, and Tárrega 
champion, thought the sound was “conical, 
pungent, and nasal,” whereas the flesh-only 
sound “possesses an intrinsic beauty . . . as 
might be the notes of an ideally expressive and 
responsive harp.”
But Segovia persevered and ultimately won out. 
It’s a good thing, too, because without the use 
of the nail, the guitarist can’t produce a sharp, 
percussive attack. And when playing the wide 
range of classical guitar music, guitarists need 
to be able to play bright, crisp sounds as well as 
soft, mellow ones.

Playing Easy Pieces

In This Chapter
 Exploring counterpoint
 Mastering melody and accompaniment
 Practicing pieces in different textures
I
n this chapter the fun begins because you get to play honest-to-goodness 
classical guitar pieces. The pieces presented here are all rather easy to 
play. Where they differ is in texture.
What do we mean when we say the pieces are easy to play? First, they make 
use of lots of open strings — and as any guitarist knows, an open string is 
easier to play than a fretted one. Next, they contain no notes played above 
the 5th fret. Even though fretting a note at the 6th fret is technically no more 
difficult than playing a note at the 4th fret, people learning to read music 
on the guitar customarily begin with the lower frets and find playing music 
in low positions the easiest. Open strings and low positions naturally go 
together because scales and chords played in low positions often include 
open strings in their very makeup. (The higher you go on the neck, the less 
likely you are to encounter those easy-to-play open strings.)
And what do we mean when we say that the pieces differ in texture? Look at 
it this way: Lemon sorbet and rice pudding are both desserts, but one is light 
and smooth while the other is thick and chunky — that is, they have differ-
ent textures. Musical compositions have texture, too. Some sound light and 
airy (a flute duet, for example), and others sound heavy and dense (a funeral 
march played by full orchestra, for instance). Texture can also refer to how 
the notes of a composition relate to each other. For example, are they played 
one at a time or all together? Do they work with each other or against each 
other? And how densely layered is the piece? Is it written for two instruments 
or 50? The classical guitar is such a versatile instrument that it can create 
myriad textures all by itself. In this chapter you discover two main classical 
guitar textures: first counterpoint, and then melody and accompaniment.

396
Book V: Classical Guitar 
Coordinating Contrapuntal 
Music: Layered Melodies
Sometimes composers create music by combining individual melodies that 
are independent of each other yet sound good together. Music containing 
independent melodies is known as counterpoint — or, to use the adjective, 
contrapuntal music. Often (but not always), a contrapuntal piece includes 
nothing but those melodies; that is, no instrument plays any actual chords. 
If a chord does occur, it’s because the various melodies happen to meet at 
a certain point and coincidentally (perhaps accidentally) produce one, not 
because the composer decided to put a chord there.
The simplest contrapuntal music is music that has two parts. That is, it con-
tains just two melodies, usually a high one (often called the treble, or treble 
part) and a low one, which can sometimes be thought of as a bass line. J. S. 
Bach’s two-part inventions (which he wrote for the keyboard) are well-known 
examples of two-part counterpoint. But how can you tell whether the low 
melody part is a true bass line or simply a low melody line? One answer is that 
it makes no difference what you prefer to call it. But perhaps a better answer is 
that it depends on how the low part sounds. For example, a low part made up 
of long, sustained notes, or of many repeated notes, can be considered a bass 
line, whereas a low part that moves a lot, as a melody does, can be thought of 
as part of the contrapuntal fabric (that is, as one of the independent melodies).
 
In classical guitar music, the low part (whether you choose to call it a bass line 
or a low melody) is always played by the thumb and the high part(s) by the 
fingers. By the way, in contrapuntal guitar compositions you rarely see more 
than two melodies combined, because playing more than two independent 
parts on the guitar is technically quite difficult. However, the upper melody 
can often be thickened with double-stops (two notes played simultaneously).
 
Another term for counterpoint is polyphony, which comes from the Greek and 
literally means “many voices.” So, contrapuntal music (music containing a 
number of independent melodies) can also be referred to as polyphonic music.
Playing two melodies in sync rhythmically
The easiest way to start playing counterpoint is with music that contains 
only two lines (melodies) that happen to be in the same rhythm. Now, you 
can understandably argue that because they’re in the same rhythm, the 
melodies aren’t truly independent of each other — and you’d be right. But for 
now, concentrate on how your fingers and thumb work together to play two 
melodies without having to worry about executing independent rhythms. The 
exercise that follows gives your thumb and fingers a workout without taxing 
your rhythmic sense.

Guitar
In Figure 2-1, a two-part arrangement of the famous Christmas carol “O Little 
Town of Bethlehem,” play all the low notes with your thumb and use any com-
fortable combination of i and m for the top voice (also called part, or melody).
 
In classical guitar notation, p = thumb, i = index, m = middle, a = ring finger, 
and c = little finger. And because the thumb and one of the fingers sometimes 
must play on adjacent strings (making a rest stroke impossible), use all free 
strokes on this one (see Chapter 1 in Book V for more on free strokes).
 
Pay special attention to places where the thumb and finger play on adjacent 
strings. That’s where the free stroke follow-through may cause your thumb 
and finger to bump into each other. But if you watch your right-hand position 
(that is, if you keep your right hand perpendicular to the strings), your 
thumb should extend well to the left of your fingers, and bumping shouldn’t 
be a problem.

Opposing forces: Separating the 
thumb and fingers rhythmically
Music whose parts are all played in the same rhythm can become boring fast. 
In this section, your thumb and fingers play melodies that are truly indepen-
dent; that is, they’re independent in rhythm as well as in pitch.
The tricky part of playing two independent melodies is that you have to keep 
track of two rhythms at the same time, which, until you get used to it, is sort 
of like rubbing your stomach and patting your head. Just make sure to count 
the required number of beats in each measure properly. For example, in 3/4 
time, even though you see what may look like six beats (three in the upper 
part and three in the lower), count the beats simultaneously for a total of 
three, not six.
Figure 2-2 comes from a minuet (a ballroom dance) by an unknown composer 
of the late 17th century. This arrangement (adaptation for guitar) is espe-
cially easy to play because of the numerous open strings in the bass part. 
Play this exercise using free strokes and with any comfortable combination of 
right-hand fingers.
Thickening the upper part 
by adding double-stops
The exercise in the previous section is pretty, but it doesn’t sound especially 
full because it consists of only two single-note parts. In this section, you 
thicken the texture by adding some double-stops (two notes played together) 
to the upper part. Actually, if you play a double-stop in the upper part along 
with a bass note, you’re playing three notes at once — a chord! And chords 
help classical guitar pieces sound full. Playing three notes at once isn’t espe-
cially difficult. Just make sure to keep your right hand relaxed and your fin-
gers nicely aligned. Depending on the strings involved, you can play the top 
notes of the chords with i-m, m-a, or i-a.
Figure 2-3 comes from a gavotte (a French dance popular in the 18th century) 
composed by German-born composer and organist George Frederick Handel 
(1685–1759), who, along with J. S. Bach, was the giant of music’s Baroque era. 
This piece is good for practice because it offers a little of everything: single 
notes, double-stops (pinches), and three-note chords, with a variety of string 
combinations on those chords (that is, sometimes the strings that make up a 
chord are adjacent or close together; other times they’re far apart).

Melody and Accompaniment: 
Using All of Your Fingers
The contrapuntal pieces discussed in this section have two melodies. But 
don’t most musical compositions, you might point out, have just one melody? 
They do, and in this section you play pieces in which a single melody pre-
dominates. What makes this style — which we call melody and accompa-
niment — tricky is that while the melody is nothing but single notes, the 
accompaniment can take any form at all: full chords, double-stops, or any-
thing that the composer (or an arranger) dreams up. Here you need to con-
tend with, among other things, four-note chords and conflicting rhythms.
 
The technical term for music with one main melody (and accompaniment) — 
especially when the melody and accompaniment are in the same rhythm — is 
homophony, which comes from the Greek and literally means “same sound.” 
So music in melody and accompaniment style can also be referred to as 
homophonic music.
Matching rhythm between 
accompaniment and melody
The simplest way to play melody and accompaniment style is to play the 
accompaniment in the same rhythm as the melody — an approach known 
as block chord style, or block style. It’s simple because it allows you to con-
centrate on playing chords without concerning yourself with conflicting 
rhythms, which may exist between the melody and accompaniment.
 
When playing block style, even though you’re playing nothing but chords, 
bring out the top note of each chord so the listener hears those top notes as 
the melody. You can’t use rest strokes to bring out the top notes, however, 
because the lower adjacent string is also being played and needs to ring out. 
So accentuate the top notes simply by plucking them slightly louder than the 
other notes of the chord.
Figure 2-4, an arrangement of the famous Christmas carol “O Christmas 
Tree,” combines the melody and accompaniment in a series of simple three-
note chords. For the right hand, play all free strokes and use p-i-m, p-m-a, or 
p-i-a, depending on the strings involved and what feels comfortable to you.
 
Normally in printed classical guitar music, notes taken by the thumb are writ-
ten with their stems pointing down from the note head (and this arrangement 
could have been notated that way). However, because the thumb and fingers

play in the same rhythm, indicating separate voices (with up and down 
stems) is unnecessary. Nevertheless, make sure to play the bottom note of 
each three-note chord with your thumb.

Getting creative with the flow: 
Two parts, two rhythms
Now we break away from block style to examine melody and accompaniment 
the way it most often appears — with the rhythm of the accompaniment not 
paralleling that of the melody. In other words, the accompaniment has its 
own rhythm. But whereas in counterpoint a melody is supported by another 
melody, in melody and accompaniment style the melody is supported by, 
well, an accompaniment — and by that we mean an accompaniment that’s 
mainly chordal in nature. So in this section you play music that contains 
melody and chords, but because their rhythms are different, the music seems 
to flow along nicely.
 
In melody and accompaniment playing (whether block style or normal, “flow-
ing” style), bring out the top notes so a listener will discern them as a melody.
Figure 2-5 comes from an andante (a piece played at a moderately slow 
tempo) by Spanish guitar composer and virtuoso Fernando Sor (1778–1839). 
Although the melody and accompaniment are in different rhythms, they’re 
rather simple, so you shouldn’t have difficulty combining them.

Playing Easy Pieces in Different 
Textural Styles
The four pieces in this section — in different styles and by a variety of com-
posers — sound like what they are: real guitar performance pieces. These are 
pieces that you can play for your friends (or your parents or your date, as the 
case may be) and duly impress them with your talent and skill. Here’s some 
useful information about the pieces to help you:
 
 “Minuet in G”: This minuet by German composer and organist J. S. 
Bach (1685–1750) wasn’t originally written for guitar but, because of its 
beauty and simplicity, is performed by guitarists with great frequency. 
The piece is quite famous, too. As explained by the character Mr. 
Holland in the 1995 film Mr. Holland’s Opus, it was used as the basis for 
the 1965 pop hit “A Lover’s Concerto” by the Toys.
 
 Notice that when one voice is rhythmically active (playing eighth notes), 
the other is relatively inactive (playing longer notes), and that the active 
part sometimes switches from voice to voice. This type of interplay 
(with fast notes against slow ones and with the active rhythm moving 
from voice to voice) is typical of Bach’s music and of contrapuntal music 

403

Guitar
in general. And that’s a good thing, not only because it makes the music 
interesting, but also because on the guitar it’s easier to play one actively 
moving voice than two. If you focus on the rhythm of the active part, the 
rhythm of the other part seems to automatically take care of itself.
 
 “Air in A Minor”: Air is another word for melody or song, and this one 
was written by the preeminent English Baroque composer Henry Purcell 
(1659–1695). The arrangement offers single notes, pinches, and chords — 
and a nice variety of string combinations on those chords.
 
 Note that in measure 9, beat 3, the upper voice moves so low that it 
actually converges with the bass. Although that note has stems pointing 
both up and down, implying that it can be taken by either the thumb or 
a finger, you’ll find it easier to take with the thumb. Also notice that in 
bars 3 and 4 the fingering is tricky because the first finger must suddenly 
jump from the 2nd string down to the 6th and then up to the 3rd. You 
may find it helpful to isolate those two measures for special practice.
 
 “America (My Country ’Tis of Thee)”: This arrangement uses many 
four-note chords in block style. The melody is taken from the British 
national anthem “God Save the King,” whose composer is unknown. 
When playing four-note chords, keep your hand in a steady but relaxed 
position and let all the motion come only from the thumb and fingers. 
But the arrangement also contains three-note chords and pinches — and 
a couple of single notes to boot. In other words, a little of everything, so 
it’s a good piece for practice. As always, use the thumb for all notes with 
stems down. For notes with stems up, use whichever fingers feel most 
natural (but with four-note chords always finger p-i-m-a).
 
 “Andante in G”: This andante was composed by Fernando Sor, and it 
offers some nice interplay between melody and accompaniment. Pay 
special attention to the rests; that is, don’t let a note before a rest con-
tinue to ring into the beat the rest falls on. If that note happens to be 
fretted (measure 5, beat 3, for example), simply release the left-hand 
finger pressure to stop the note from sounding. But if the string is open 
(measure 13, beat 3, for instance), you need to lightly touch it with a 
finger (of whichever hand feels more natural) to stop it from sounding. 
As you become proficient, your hands will automatically stop strings 
from sounding when necessary without you having to think about it.
 
 As usual, take advantage of all guide finger opportunities, as in mea-
sures 7, 9, 10, 15, and 16. Measures 15 and 16, in fact, are a guide finger 
extravaganza. You use two guide fingers at the same time (fingers 1 and 
2), making it a “double guide finger,” and those fingers guide your hand 
down the neck twice in a row (from 3rd position to 2nd, then from 2nd 
position to 1st), making it a “double double guide finger.”

Chapter 3
Combining Arpeggios and Melody
In This Chapter
 Combining arpeggios with a melody in the bass
 Combining arpeggios with a melody in the treble
 Combining arpeggios with a melody that alternates between treble and bass
P
erhaps nothing is more satisfying to a classical guitarist than a composi-
tion that deftly combines arpeggios (notes of a chord played separately) 
and melodies. And the reason is simple: To a listener, the piece sounds intri-
cate and advanced (sometimes even virtuosic), yet typically, it’s not very 
difficult to play. So, with such pieces, you can amaze your friends without 
actually being a Segovia.
In this chapter, you discover how melody and arpeggios work together 
quite simply to create beautiful pieces, and you learn how to play them 
with ease.
 
In classical guitar notation, p = thumb, i = index, m = middle, a = ring finger, 
and c = little finger.
Grasping the Combination in Context
Combining a melody with an arpeggio is often a matter of simply playing the 
notes you’re already fingering (rather than having to play additional notes) — 
the melody’s notes are usually contained within the arpeggio itself. Also, when 
you play an arpeggio, all or many of the chord’s notes are either open strings 
or are already held down (as a chord) by your left hand. Your right-hand 
fingers, too, are already in position — each resting in preparedness against 
its respective string. In other words, your hands hardly move for the dura-
tion of each arpeggio.

410
Book V: Classical Guitar 
How, you may wonder, can you simultaneously play notes with various values 
(that is, quarter notes, whole notes, eighth notes, and so on) and keep them 
from sounding like a blur of overlapping pitches while also letting them all 
ring out as long as possible in each measure? The answer is that you actually 
play the notes at different levels of loudness — or, perhaps, different levels of 
emphasis. You do that by giving more oomph to some notes than to others.
The human touch (your touch, as determined by your understanding of 
the notes’ roles and interactions) imparts the proper textural feel to the 
listener — and that’s what makes playing such pieces so exciting. If you 
give the right amount of emphasis to the respective notes (even merely 
psychologically), the effect comes across to the listener, who hears the 
music not as just a blur of overlapping pitches but as a melody, an accom-
paniment, and a bass line. The technique for doing that varies, depending 
on whether you play the melody with your thumb or fingers.
 
When playing arpeggios, hold down your left-hand fingers as a chord when-
ever possible and for as long as possible. And keep the motion of your right 
hand to a minimum by resting your fingers ahead of time against the strings 
they need to play in each arpeggio. For example, before playing an A minor 
arpeggio (as in measure 1 in Figure 3-1), your thumb should be resting 
against the 5th string, your index finger against the 3rd string, and your 
middle finger against the 2nd string. While playing each arpeggio, your right 
hand itself doesn’t move; only your fingers and thumb move as they strike 
their respective strings.
In the sections that follow, the exercises allow you to combine arpeggios with 
melodies in the bass (played by the thumb) and the treble (played by the 
fingers), and we explore ways to draw the melody out of the background and 
into the limelight, where it belongs.
Going Downtown: Melody in the Bass
The melody of a classical guitar piece, though usually played by the fingers 
on the high strings (in the treble), is sometimes played by the thumb on the 
low strings (in the bass). This concept applies to the piano, too, by the way. 
The right hand plays the melody of most pieces, though for a different effect, 
the melody can be placed in the left hand.
You may find it easier to combine arpeggios with a melody played by your 
thumb than by your fingers. For one thing, your thumb usually plays on the 
beat (rather than between the beats, as the fingers do). For another, you 
have no decisions to make about which finger plays the melody; that is, your 
thumb, acting alone, plays nothing but the melody notes while your fingers 
play nothing but the accompaniment (the higher notes of each arpeggio).

411
 Chapter 3: Combining Arpeggios and Melody
Book V
Classical 
Guitar
Don’t worry about having to hunt down the melody in a piece. The melody 
usually reveals itself soon enough when you start to play, just in the way the 
composer or arranger wrote the notes. Sometimes the written music itself 
even offers clues, such as giving the melody its own stem direction. When you 
can hear where the melody falls, you can work to bring it out further, using 
slightly stronger strokes on the melody notes themselves. Or, if there’s no 
melody at all (which sometimes happens in short passages between melodic 
phrases), you hear that, too, and give no emphasis to any particular notes.
Playing a melody within 
arpeggios in the bass
How do you bring out the notes when the melody is in the bass line? Just play 
them a little louder (striking them a little harder) than the other notes, and 
make sure the other notes are consistent with each other in loudness.
Figure 3-1 is an exercise that offers you an opportunity to practice the basic 
technique of combining arpeggios with a bass melody without having to 
worry about any of the complicated rhythms or unusual left-hand fingerings 
that real-life pieces may contain.

Book V: Classical Guitar 
Note that the first note of each triplet group has a downward stem (in addi-
tion to an upward stem). Those downward stems tell you not only to play 
those notes with your thumb but also to play them as quarter notes — in 
other words, to let them ring throughout the beat.
One of the rules of arpeggio playing is that all the notes of an arpeggio should 
ring out rather than be stopped short — so all of those bass notes sound as 
quarter notes anyway. So, in reality, those downward stems on the first note 
of each triplet group tell you not only to play them with the thumb and to let 
them ring out, but also to bring out those thumb notes so a listener will hear 
them as an independent melody.
Measure 2 presents an interesting right-hand fingering dilemma. Normal, or 
typical, right-hand position has the index finger assigned to the 3rd string, 
the middle finger to the 2nd, and the ring finger to the 1st. Also, you gener-
ally try not to move the right hand itself, if at all possible. For those reasons, 
you’d expect to use fingers m and a to play the top two notes of the D minor 
arpeggio.
But another rule of arpeggio playing says you should use the strongest fin-
gers whenever possible — and the combination of i and m is stronger than 
that of m and a. So, according to that rule, you should use i and m for the top 
two strings even though you have to move your right hand across the neck a 
bit. Hence the dilemma.
 
When you have a situation in which those right-hand fingering rules conflict, 
the “strong fingers” rule takes precedence over the “minimize motion” rule, 
and thus we indicate in measure 2 that you play the top two notes of the D 
minor arpeggio with i and m.
Figure 3-1 presents no technical difficulties, but for best results, follow the left-
hand fingering carefully and keep the rhythm as steady and even as possible.
Practicing making a bass 
melody stand out
Figure 3-2 is taken from a study by early 19th-century Spanish guitar virtuoso 
Dionisio Aguado. It features a single right-hand pattern throughout (p-i-m-i) 
and a uniform rhythm. That’s what makes it easy to play. But at the same 
time, the study is somewhat challenging for a few reasons.
 
 First, the notes are 16th notes, which means they move along rather 
briskly. So start out by practicing slowly and then gradually increase 
the tempo.

413
 Chapter 3: Combining Arpeggios and Melody

 Second, the bass notes — because they’re all chord tones that occur at 
the beginning of each four-note group — have a tendency to sound like 
nothing more than simply the first note of each arpeggio. So it’s your job 
to make them especially melodic; that is, bring them out forcefully — 
but smoothly and sweetly — so a listener hears a “tune” in the bass.
 
 Finally, you play some of the notes on strings you may not expect. Check 
out measure 2, beat 4, for example, where, in order to preserve the 
right-hand pattern (and flow), you play the C on the 3rd string, and the 
repeated Es alternate between the 2nd and 1st strings.

For ease of playing, pay special attention to the left-hand fingering (and espe-
cially to the guide finger indications). And for an effective performance, keep 
the rhythm as even as possible.
Moving Uptown: Melody in the Treble
We start with melodies in the bass because, as we explain earlier, they’re a 
bit easier to combine with arpeggios than are melodies in the treble. Alas, 
arpeggio pieces with melodies in the treble are actually more common than 
those with melodies in the bass. In this section, we look at the technique you 
use to play such pieces.

414
Book V: Classical Guitar 
Playing arpeggios with the melody in the treble rather than the bass can be a 
bit trickier for a few reasons:
 
 Question of fingering: Technically, any given melody note can be taken 
with any available finger — i, m, or a — and it’s often up to you to 
decide which to use.
 
 Use of the ring finger: Because the i and m fingers usually play accom-
paniment notes on the inner strings, the a finger takes many melody 
notes. The problem is that the melody notes must be emphasized, but 
the ring finger is the weakest.
 
 Question of right-hand technique: As explained in the sections that 
follow, you have more than one way to bring out a treble melody from 
an arpeggio, and it’s up to you to decide which technique to use.
 
 Use of rest strokes: Whereas you play arpeggios with a melody in the 
bass with free strokes only, you generally combine rest strokes and free 
strokes when you play arpeggios with a melody in the treble.
 
 Complexity of notation: Standard music notation for arpeggio pieces 
with a melody in the treble often requires the indication of three sepa-
rate parts, or voices — one each for the melody, the accompaniment 
(usually filler notes on the inner strings), and the bass. Normally, stem 
directions tell you which notes belong to which part (for example, notes 
with stems up are melody and notes with stems down are bass). 
Depending on the musical context (or sometimes simply on the amount 
of available space), the accompaniment notes may be stemmed either 
down (sometimes making them hard to distinguish from bass notes) or 
up (sometimes hard to distinguish from melody notes). Sometimes, at 
the whim of a composer or arranger, the melody and accompaniment 
notes are combined into a single voice (as a continuous flow of 
upstemmed eighth notes, for example), and it’s up to you, using your 
ear, to discover the real melody.
 
Although the aforementioned potential complications may cause you con-
cern, most arpeggiated pieces — even those with the melody in the treble — 
aren’t difficult to play. That’s because, as stated, in such pieces, the left-hand 
generally holds down a chord, and the melody notes themselves are often 
contained within that chord.
To bring out the melody in the treble, you have to make it either louder than, 
or different in tone from, the other notes. You can do this simply by
 
 Making the melody notes sound stronger than the others by playing them 
with rest strokes (and the accompaniment notes with free strokes — see 
Chapter 1 in Book V for more on rest and free strokes). You can also try 
the techniques in the following bullets, but this technique — the use of 
rest strokes for melody notes — is generally used by classical guitarists, 
and it’s the one you should strive to perfect.

 Striking the melody notes harder than the others, as you do when you 
bring out a bass melody with the thumb.
 
 Making the melody notes brighter sounding than the others by using 
more nail when you strike them — that is, if you play with a combination 
of flesh and nail, use more nail than flesh on the melody notes, and more 
flesh than nail on the accompaniment notes. (See Chapter 1 in Book V 
for details on the nail-flesh tone.)
Playing a treble melody within arpeggios
Figure 3-3 is an exercise that allows you to combine a treble melody with a 
series of arpeggios. Note that you play the melody in quarter notes (indi-
cated by upward quarter-note stems), that the bass notes are whole notes 
(and thus must ring throughout each measure), and that the accompaniment 
notes are eighth-note triplets, which, though they are written as short notes, 
should also ring out (according to the general rules of arpeggio playing).

Practice Figure 3-3 using rest strokes on all the melody notes. Start out play-
ing slowly (but evenly), and then gradually increase your speed. Follow the 
left-hand fingerings to ensure that you can hold down each chord with your 
left hand for as long as possible. If necessary, listen to the CD to hear how the 
piece works rhythmically and how the separate voices interact.

Practicing making a treble 
melody stand out
Figure 3-4 comes from a study by late 19th-century Spanish guitar virtuoso 
Francisco Tárrega. It employs a consistent right-hand pattern throughout: 
p-i-m, a-m-i, a-m-i, a-m-i. Play all the melody notes as rest strokes with the 
ring finger.

Note that the bass notes sustain throughout each arpeggio, but in measure 3,
fingering requirements force you to stop the bass from ringing one beat early 
(because the finger that plays the bass note, the first finger, is suddenly 
needed on the 1st string to play the last melody note of the measure).
Mixing Up Your Melodic Moves: The 
Thumb and Fingers Take Turns
Not all arpeggiated passages are as straightforward as those you encounter 
earlier in this chapter — where the melody occurs consistently in either the 
treble or bass part. In some cases the melody moves back and forth between 
the treble and bass, and in others the treble and bass parts contain melodic

motion simultaneously. Fortunately, the playing of such pieces requires no 
new techniques, but it does require a heightened awareness (on your part) of 
where the melody is and how to bring it out.
Playing a shifting treble-and-bass 
melody within arpeggios
In Figure 3-5, from measure to measure, the melody alternates between the 
treble and bass. In the odd-numbered measures, which have the melody in 
the treble, bring out the melody (the upstemmed notes) with rest strokes. 
For the even-numbered measures, which have the melody in the bass, bring 
out the melody (the downstemmed notes) by giving the first note of each 
triplet a little more oomph than the other notes.

Note that the melody note that occurs on the third beat of each measure is a 
dissonance (that is, it’s not a member of the chord being arpeggiated), but 
that it passes smoothly from one chord tone to another. For example, in 
measure 1, in which an E minor chord (made up of the notes E, G, and B) is 
arpeggiated, the F# on beat 3 functions as a passing tone (a dissonance that, 
in stepwise motion, passes between, and thus fills the gap between, two 
chord tones — in this case, G and E). Also note, as a point of interest, that 
each bass melody is a repetition, but two octaves lower, of the treble 
melody that precedes it. Repetition imparts structural unity and thus a 
sense of balance to a composition.
Practicing making a shifting 
melody stand out
Figure 3-6 is an excerpt from a waltz from the guitar method of early 19th-
century Italian guitar composer and virtuoso Ferdinando Carulli. A glance at 
the music reveals that the melody begins in the bass (measures 1 and 2) and 
moves to the treble (measures 3 through 5).

 Chapter 3: Combining Arpeggios and Melody
Book V
Classical 
Guitar
In measures 3 and 4, note that in the written notation, for the sake of simplic-
ity, the composer combined the melody (the upstemmed notes on the beats: 
F#-G-F#, G-F#-G) and the accompaniment notes (the open B’s) into a single 
voice. What you need to realize is that although the melody notes are written 
as eighths, they are to be rendered in performance as quarters.
 
In Figure 3-5 you play a dissonance known as a passing tone. “Waltz in E 
Minor” presents another type of dissonance: the neighboring tone. A neigh-
boring tone is a non-chord tone that, in stepwise motion, follows a chord tone 
and then returns to it (with the word “neighboring” obviously coming from 
the idea that, being just one step away from the chord tone, the dissonant 
note is like the chord tone’s next-door neighbor). For example, in measure 3 
you arpeggiate a B chord (B-D#-F#), and the G on beat 2 follows and then 
returns to the chord tone F#. Because G is above F# in the scale, it’s called, 
specifically, an upper neighbor. In the following measure you arpeggiate an E 
minor chord (E-G-B), and the F# on beat 2 (following and then returning to G) 
is a lower neighbor.
Playing Pieces that Combine 
Arpeggios and Melodies
Unlike simple arpeggio-and-melody practice exercises, which generally 
feature easy left-hand fingerings or consistent right-hand patterns, real-life 
pieces often contain complications in the form of some not-so-easy finger-
ings and not-so-consistent patterns. In this section we offer, for your practice 
and enjoyment, pieces by classical guitar masters that combine arpeggios 
with melodies — one with the melody in the bass, one with the melody in the 
treble, and one with a melody that moves between the treble and bass.
Here’s some information to help you with the pieces:
 
 “Ländler in D”: A ländler is an Austrian folk dance in 3/4 time (or a musi-
cal piece to accompany such a dance), and this one was composed by 
19th-century Hungarian guitar virtuoso Johann Kaspar Mertz.
 
 Play notes with stems both up and down (generally on beats 1 and 3 in 
the first section and on each beat in the second) with the thumb, and 
bring them out as a melody (and remember to hold down all the notes of 
each measure as a chord whenever possible).

420
Book V: Classical Guitar 
 
 In measures 13 through 20, you play only a single note after each bass 
note, so the patterns aren’t true arpeggios. That is, an arpeggio is a 
“broken chord,” and a chord, by definition, contains three or more 
notes. However, in that section, if you think of each beat as a two-note 
“chord,” you can see that you’re still playing in arpeggio style (meaning 
that the thumb and fingers alternate).
 
 In two-note arpeggio figures (as in measures 13 through 20), your 
thumb, of course, plays all the bass notes. You play the treble notes, if 
they change pitch from beat to beat, by alternating between i and m. But 
if the pitch of the treble notes remains constant, as in this instance, you 
usually play the notes with just one finger — either i or m (depending on 
which strings your thumb plays and how close they are to the treble 
string in question). Try measures 13 through 20 first using i for all the 
open E’s and then using m, and see which fingering you prefer.
 
 “Romanza”: This is one of the all-time most famous classical guitar 
pieces; virtually every classical guitarist encounters it and plays it at 
some time or another. It’s known by several titles, including “Romanza,” 
“Romance,” “Spanish Romance,” and “Romance d’Amour.” In most col-
lections that include it, the composer is said to be anonymous, which 
may lead you to believe that the piece was written hundreds of years 
ago. Actually, the piece isn’t nearly that old, and the identity of the com-
poser isn’t so much unknown as it is in doubt or in dispute; a number of 
composers have claimed authorship of this piece.
 
 As indicated, play all the melody notes with the a (ring) finger, and bring 
them out by emphasizing, or accenting, them slightly. Even though a 
may be the weakest finger, it’s charged with the important work of carry-
ing the melody here.
 
 What makes this piece relatively easy is the great number of open strings 
(as is typically the case with pieces in the key of E minor). What makes 
it difficult (besides the many barre chords) are the left-hand stretches in 
measures 10, 27, and 28. Isolate those measures and practice them sepa-
rately, if necessary. And what makes the piece interesting (besides its 
inherent beauty) is the shift from the minor to the major key in the second 
section (at measure 17), and then the return to the minor key after mea-
sure 32. The major section is more difficult than the minor because it has 
fewer open strings, so you may need to practice that section a bit more.
 
 “Andante in C”: Just as Carulli did with “Waltz in E Minor” in Figure 
3-6, so too did early 19th-century Italian guitar virtuoso Matteo Carcassi 
combine the melody and accompaniment notes into a single part. But 
whereas in the Carulli piece it’s obvious which notes are melody and 
which are accompaniment, this piece has a certain amount of ambigu-
ity. Sometimes, as in the first two full measures, it’s easy to discern the 
melody: it’s made up of the notes that occur at beats 1, 2, and 4 (and 

421
 Chapter 3: Combining Arpeggios and Melody
Book V

Guitar
which should be rendered in performance as a quarter note, a half note, 
and a quarter). But in the next measure, is the A on beat 4 melody or 
accompaniment? And in the measure after, are the final three notes 
(G, F, and D) melody or accompaniment? Only Carcassi could answer 
definitively, but because you can’t ask him, it’s up to you, the performer, 
to answer such questions by bringing out (or not bringing out) those 
ambiguous notes accordingly.
 
 If you look at the piece’s second section (measures 10 through 17), you 
see that the upper voice contains a melody (albeit intermingled with 
accompaniment notes in the same voice) and that the bass part also 
moves melodically. This really gives you an opportunity to practice your 
melody/arpeggio chops (or to display them, as the case may be). All at 
once you have to decide which of the upstemmed notes you consider 
the real melody notes, to bring out those notes from the notes that 
function merely as accompaniment, and to also bring out the separate 
melody that occurs in the bass!
 
 Because Carcassi’s notation leaves some unanswered questions, 
you may wonder why he didn’t employ three separate voices in his 
notation — one for the upper melody, one for the filler (accompani-
ment) notes, and one for the bass line. He could have, and some pieces 
are so notated. However, the risk is that the notation is so complicated 
that it’s counterproductive. That’s why Carcassi chose to notate the 
piece as he did. But that doesn’t mean a different composer may have 
notated it as three separate voices.

Classical Guitar Genres: The 
Renaissance to the 20th Century
In This Chapter
 Acquainting yourself with the musical styles of the Renaissance and Baroque eras
 Getting hooked on the Classical era
 Growing more passionate: The Romantic era
 Creating a new musical language: The Modern era
M
usic historians like to divide music into well-defined periods, or 
eras. Music from before around 1450 — the Middle Ages, or medieval 
period — was mainly sung in church, and today it sounds so primitive that 
it’s hardly ever played on guitar. The next period, from about 1450 to around 
1600, is known as the Renaissance era, and the following period, from around 
1600 to 1750, is the Baroque era — and the music of those eras does still 
sound good on guitar.
The Baroque era was rather complex. Bach’s counterpoint was sometimes 
intricate to the extreme, as were many of the instrumental ornaments (trills, 
turns, and so on) that were written into the music and improvised by the 
era’s virtuoso performers. After the death of Bach (1750), as a reaction 
against the showy aspect of Baroque (which means “ornate”) music, compos-
ers began to write pieces that were more formal, sedate, elegant, and grace-
ful. Enter the Classical era (1750–1820).
Toward the end of the Classical era, composers started to feel restrained by 
that formality and began to use a musical vocabulary that better expressed 
their innermost feelings, yearnings, and desires. This led to music’s Romantic 
era (1820–1900). By the end of the 1800s, every aspect of traditional harmony, 
melody, and rhythm had been explored and employed, and composers began 
to experiment with new kinds of scales, chords, and rhythms. The result 
was the Modern era (after 1900), whose music sounds nothing like anything 
that had gone before it. In this chapter we take a look at what typifies these 
genres of music.

Book V: Classical Guitar 
The Renaissance
Because the Renaissance directly followed the Middle Ages, composers of the 
late 1400s and 1500s were influenced by the earlier era’s music — namely, 
vocal music performed in church. To show respect for God, such music con-
tained nothing ugly or jarring. So Renaissance melodies, like the tunes of the 
earlier period, tend to be simple (containing more stepwise motion than wide 
leaps), and the harmonies tend to be mostly pure and simple (three-note 
major and minor chords). Renaissance composers also wrote instrumental 
and secular (nonreligious) music, and there they pushed some limits.
Renaissance music differs from music of other eras in the scales, instruments, 
and textures it uses. Our modern ears are used to hearing songs and classical 
pieces in major and minor keys (keys based on major and minor scales), but 
in the Renaissance era, the system of major and minor keys had not yet been 
developed. Instead, music was based on special scales called modes, which is 
why Renaissance pieces sound somewhat strange and exotic to us.
 
If you play only the white notes of a piano keyboard step by step, from C to C, 
you get a major scale, and if you play from A to A you get a minor scale. But if 
you play only white keys from any of the other five white keys (for example, 
from D to D or from F to F), you get a unique-sounding scale — a mode — 
that’s neither major nor minor. During the Renaissance, composers wrote 
pieces based on those unique scales as well as on major and minor scales, 
but to a Renaissance composer, the major and minor scales were nothing 
special; they were simply two of the seven possible modes.
Today we’re used to hearing music played on instruments like the piano, 
guitar, and violin, but those weren’t fully developed during the Renaissance. 
Instead, music was played on instruments like the harpsichord, lute (a prede-
cessor of the guitar with a rounded back), recorder, and viol — an early cello-
like instrument with frets.
Two types of Renaissance music often played on classical guitar are arrange-
ments of traditional 16th-century melodies and arrangements of pieces origi-
nally written for the lute. The sections that follow cover both of these.
Traditional 16th-century melodies 
by anonymous composers
The Renaissance — the time of Christopher Columbus, Leonardo da Vinci, 
and William Shakespeare — happened so long ago that the authorship of 
many of that era’s musical works is unknown. In such cases, the composer 
is considered anonymous, or the piece in question is said to be traditional. 
Some anonymous melodies from that era are well-known today because

musicians throughout the ages have continued to arrange and perform them. 
Such songs include “Greensleeves” (also known as “What Child Is This?”), 
“Scarborough Fair,” “Coventry Carol,” and “The Three Ravens.”
“Greensleeves” has been recorded by countless modern artists, from 
the Chipmunks to Elvis Presley. But Figure 4-1 shows how a Renaissance 
musician — Francis Cutting (c. 1550–1596) — arranged the song for lute 
(here adapted for guitar). The melody and chords may sound a little differ-
ent from how you’re used to hearing them, but that’s understandable when 
you consider that this arrangement was written more than 400 years ago.

The song sounds like it’s in the key of A minor, but the F# in measure 6 tells 
you that the piece is actually based on one of the Renaissance modes (in this 
case the so-called Dorian mode, which sounds minor-ish but whose 6th 
degree is a half step higher than that of a normal minor scale). Also note the 

432
Book V: Classical Guitar 
sudden change in harmony to A major (as opposed to A minor) in the final 
measure. Such sudden shifts between major and minor harmonies are typical 
in Renaissance music.
John Dowland and other great lutenists
During the Renaissance, lute composer/performers (called lutenists) flour-
ished in England, France, and Italy, but the English lutenists — including 
Thomas Campion, Francis Cutting, and Philip Rosseter — are best known 
today. The most famous of all is Englishman John Dowland (1563–1626), who 
in his later years served as court lutenist for King James I.
Dowland is known for both his solo lute pieces and his lute songs, which con-
sist of a vocal part, a poem set to music and sung, and a lute accompaniment. 
But the accompaniment was generally of such intricacy that the lute part was 
more or less equal to the vocal part (rather than subordinate to it), and a 
lute song was really more like a duet (between voice and lute) than a simple 
melody and accompaniment.
In writing a lute song, a composer tried to reflect in his music the mood or 
emotion of the poem (lyric) being sung. Because many of the poems Dowland 
set to music concern grief and sorrow (“Flow My Tears” and “In Darkness Let 
Me Dwell,” for example), he has a reputation for being melancholy. In fact, 
Figure 4-2 is an excerpt from a solo lute piece he titled “Melancholy Galliard.” 
(A galliard is a dance in 3/4 time — or music written for such a dance — pop-
ular in Europe in the 1600s.)
 
As a compositional device, Dowland here employs suspension, in which a conso-
nant tone becomes dissonant when the chord behind it changes (see beat 2 of 
measures 2, 4, and 8). Also note that Dowland — and Renaissance composers in 
general — gives an important role to the inner voice — in this case, the one fea-
turing the aforementioned suspensions. In music of most other eras the melody 
and bass predominate, with the inner voices relegated to second-class status.
A bit about the lute
During the Renaissance, the most popular 
instrument was the lute. It resembles a modern 
classical guitar in that it has a body and a neck 
with frets, strings, and tuning pegs — but it dif-
fers from a guitar in a number of ways:
  The lute has a rounded back rather than a 
flat one. To get an idea of what a lute’s body 
looks like, think of half a watermelon that’s 
been cut lengthwise.
  The lute’s neck is shorter than a classical 
guitar’s, and the lute’s body typically meets 
the fretboard at the 9th fret (rather than at 
the 12th fret, as on a modern guitar).

  The neck is also wider because the lute typi-
cally has more strings than a guitar. A lute 
can have more than six strings (seven, eight, 
or more), and most of the strings — all but 
the highest one or two — are actually sets of 
double strings that are plucked together as 
if single, as on a modern 12-string guitar. A 
single high string or a set of double strings — 
whether tuned in unison, as with the middle 
strings, or tuned in octaves, as with the low 
strings — is called a course, so you may 
hear of a 6-course lute or an 8-course lute 
(rather than a 6- or 8-string lute).
  A lute is typically tuned a little differently 
from a guitar. In a 6-course lute (a common 
configuration), the 3rd course, which cor-
responds to the open G string on a guitar, is 
tuned a major 3rd above the 4th course (the 
guitar’s open D string), rather than a per-
fect 4th above it, as on a guitar. That’s why 
music originally written for lute must be 
adapted (rearranged or refingered) for the 
guitar (unless the modern guitarist tunes his 
3rd [G] string down a half step to F#).
  The lute’s headstock (the part with the 
tuning pegs) is angled back from the neck 
perpendicularly rather than being in line 
with the neck, as on a modern guitar.

Book V: Classical Guitar 
Going for Baroque
If you ask a casual music listener what his favorite kind of classical music is, 
he’s likely to answer Baroque. And that’s not surprising, because Baroque 
music — exemplified by such composers as Bach, Handel, Vivaldi, Scarlatti, 
and Telemann — has quite a bit in common with modern-day popular music. 
For one thing, Baroque music, like popular music, is based on major and 
minor keys and the chord progressions derived from those keys. For another, 
Baroque pieces often feature one instrument playing melody, another playing 
chords, and another playing a bass line — not unlike today’s pop group with 
a singer, guitarist, and bassist. Also like today’s pop music, Baroque music is 
known for its regular, steady rhythm.
But Baroque music is different from today’s popular music in many ways, 
too, and not just because it sounds like, well, classical music. Baroque music 
often employs imitative counterpoint, in which a melody played in one voice is 
repeated a few beats later (usually from a different starting pitch) in another 
voice. Also, whereas popular music employs simple song structures that 
are usually made up of two or three short sections that sometimes repeat, 
Baroque music uses all sorts of complex, extended forms, such as concer-
tos, suites, operas, and cantatas. And whereas today’s popular music can be 
played by amateurs and professionals alike, much Baroque music was writ-
ten for virtuoso performers who often added their own highly complex orna-
mentation as they played.
Two composers who brought Baroque music to its peak are Johann Sebastian 
Bach (1685–1750) and George Frideric Handel (1685–1759). The following sec-
tions explore the classical guitar music based on their compositions.
Back to Bach
Bach’s music is known for its almost paradoxical combination of intricate 
structure and strong passion. In a way, it sounds as though it was put 
together mathematically, and in another way, it sounds as though it came 
purely intuitively, or from the heart. One of Bach’s most famous pieces, popu-
larly titled “Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring,” comes from one of his many church 
cantatas (pieces for vocal soloists, chorus, and orchestra that form part of 
a church service). The piece’s beauty and elegance has made it a popular 
wedding processional, even though that wasn’t what Bach intended when he 
wrote it, and it’s performed routinely by classical guitarists.
Figure 4-3 is an excerpt from “Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring,” and you can hear 
that the music is both logical and beautiful at the same time. It’s in a style 
known as strict counterpoint, which means that each note of one voice is 
played against a strictly set number of notes in another voice — in this case, 
each bass note has exactly three treble notes.

Although today Bach is the most famous Baroque composer (and among the 
most famous composers of all time), during his lifetime in his native Germany 
he was celebrated as a virtuoso organist rather than as a composer because 
his original works were considered too complex. The simpler pieces of fellow 
German composer Georg Philipp Telemann were held in higher regard. In 
fact, it wasn’t until 79 years after his death — when 20-year-old German com-
poser Felix Mendelssohn produced and conducted a performance of the St. 
Matthew Passion in Berlin — that Bach’s music began to receive the acclaim it 
deserved.
Getting a handle on Handel
Along with J. S. Bach, G. F. Handel was the other giant of the Baroque era. 
Handel is well-known for two of his orchestral suites, Water Music and 
Royal Fireworks, but he’s probably best known for his large-scale work for 
orchestra, chorus, and soloists that’s now performed every Christmas — the 

436
Book V: Classical Guitar 
Messiah (even though he originally wrote it to celebrate Easter). And the 
most famous section of the Messiah is the one that audiences customarily 
stand up for, the “Hallelujah Chorus.” (Legend has it that at the first perfor-
mance of the Messiah, England’s King George II was so roused by the music 
that he suddenly rose to his feet — and when the king rose, everyone in his 
presence was required to rise. Since then, audiences have always stood for 
that section of the performance.)
Figure 4-4 is an excerpt from Handel’s “Hallelujah Chorus,” arranged for 
guitar (resist the urge to stand). The piece starts with some simple major 
chords played in a strong, distinctive rhythm, but a suspension in measure 4 
changes the mood with a bit of tension.
 
In this excerpt Handel uses a common compositional device known as modu-
lation, in which a piece begins in one key but changes to a different key. In 
this case the passage begins in E major (measures 1 through 4) but ends in B 
major (measures 5 through 8).

Book V
Classical 
Guitar
The Classical Era: Mozart’s Muse
Immersing yourself in music of the Classical era is a bit like accompanying 
your aunt to a formal tea party. Everything is proper and elegant and dainty — 
and everyone is on his or her best behavior. To put it another way, strict rules 
are followed.
The two most prominent composers of the Classical era were both Austrian: 
Franz Joseph Haydn (1732–1809), who wrote more than 100 symphonies and 
established the symphony as a musical form, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 
(1756–1791), with Mozart ultimately becoming the true giant of the era.
What set Mozart apart from many other composers was his ability to write a 
great melody — a pretty tune. Some composers concentrate on rhythm, har-
mony, or texture; others create melody by taking short fragments and piecing 
them together. But nothing lends appeal to a composition as much as a good 
melody. And Mozart was particularly aware of this. In fact, he once explained, 
“Melody is the essence of music. A good melody writer is like a fine race-
horse, but a counterpoint writer is like a horse that carries the mail.”
Because Mozart’s melodies are so tuneful, his music can be a delight to play 
on classical guitar. Figure 4-5 is an arrangement of an excerpt from an aria 
(song) from Mozart’s 1787 opera Don Giovanni. As you play it (or listen to it 
on the accompanying CD), you hear that the melody is simple, playful, and 
quite childlike. Mozart’s playfulness is another quality that sets him apart 
from other Classical-era composers.
 
Note that Mozart puts the chords on the off beats rather than on the beats, 
giving the song a secondary accent (or a kind of backbeat, not unlike that found 
in today’s pop music). Also note that the piece consists of two four-bar phrases. 
The three double-stops that connect those phrases (at the end of measure 4) 
aren’t part of the aria’s vocal melody, and you should play them very smoothly. 
In contrast, you should play the two notes that finish the second phrase (also 
not part of the vocal melody) very short (as indicated by the staccato dots).
 
A secondary accent is different from syncopation. A secondary accent is 
a normal, natural part of a meter. For example, in 2/2 time, beat 1 gets the 
primary accent, and beat 2 gets a secondary accent; that is normal and 
expected. In syncopation, notes are accented in unexpected places — 
places that conflict with or go against a given meter.

Beethoven, the Classical 
Hopeless Romantic
Starting in the early 1800s, certain composers who’d previously written in 
a Classical style began to make their music more emotional and colorful. 
This began a transition from the formality of the Classical era to the passion 
and intensity of the Romantic era. One such composer was Austrian Franz 
Schubert, who wrote more than 600 songs for voice and piano. But by far the 
most important of these transition-era composers was Ludwig van Beethoven 
(1770–1827) of Germany.
Beethoven was a pretty emotional guy — so emotional, in fact, that he had 
to invent a whole new style of music to express his feelings. And for that he’s 
generally credited with initiating music’s Romantic era.
At the beginning of his career, Beethoven wrote in a style similar to that of 
Haydn and Mozart, but by his 30s he was breaking free of his predecessors. He 
expanded the traditional harmonic, rhythmic, and textural vocabulary by length-
ening musical forms (adding extra movements, or sections, to pieces), and by 
adding more instruments to his orchestral scores, such as brass and percussion.

Figure 4-6 is an arrangement of an excerpt from the second movement of 
Beethoven’s “Piano Sonata No. 8” (the “Pathétique Sonata”), written in 1798. 
Though the first movement is fiery and emotional, the second movement, 
often played by guitarists, is in a straightforward Classical style. The piece 
features a pretty melody supported by arpeggios, so make sure to bring out 
the top line and to allow the arpeggios to ring out as long as possible.
 
Note that although the harmony consists of simple major, minor, and 7th 
chords, notes other than the chords’ roots often serve as the bass notes. For 
example, in measure 2, the first chord, C major, has an E (rather than a C) in 
the bass, and the second chord, G7, has a B (rather than a G) in the bass. A 
chord that has a tone other than the root (namely, the 3rd, 5th, or 7th) as the 
bass note is said to be in inversion. Composers use inversions to add har-
monic interest to their compositions — as Beethoven does here.

Book V: Classical Guitar 
Another Romantic: Brahms
As the 1800s proceeded, composers of concert music strayed farther and 
farther from the formal, controlled style of the Classical era. Partly, they 
were influenced by the new musical style of Beethoven. But they were also 
influenced by music that was being composed for the opera, where stories 
of myth and legend required bold new sounds. And they were influenced, 
too, by traditional tunes from their native countries (as were, for example, 
Hungarian Franz Liszt and Polish-born Frederic Chopin). And, like Beethoven, 
Romantic-era composers felt a need to express their inner feelings.
Many composers of the Romantic era are well-known today — including 
the aforementioned Schubert, Liszt, and Chopin, as well as Germany’s Felix 
Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, and Richard Wagner; France’s Hector 
Berlioz; and Russia’s Peter Ilich Tchaikovsky. But perhaps the most famous 
of all is Germany’s Johannes Brahms (1833–1897).
Though Brahms used the complex musical vocabulary of the Romantic era, 
he differed from many of his contemporaries in that he wrote absolute music 
(music that exists for its own sake, as pure music) rather than program music 
(music that’s meant to tell a story, evoke a mood, depict a scene, and so on).
Next to Brahms’ famous “Lullaby,” his rhythmically intense “Hungarian Dance 
No. 5” (composed in 1868 for piano duet as part of a set of 21 Hungarian 
dances) is probably his best-known work. Though you may not know it by 
name, you’re sure to recognize it when you hear it, because it’s been used in 
countless movies and cartoons.
Figure 4-7 is an arrangement of an excerpt from “Hungarian Dance No. 5.” The 
colorful dissonance (lack of harmony) in measure 3 (a G# melody note against 
a D minor chord) is a Romantic-era harmonic touch; in earlier eras, such a 
dissonance would have been immediately resolved to a consonance (that is, 
the unharmonious tone would have been moved up or down to a tone that 
did blend with the background chord).

Debussy: Music Becomes Modern
Music at the end of the 1800s was very different from, and more complex 
than, music at the beginning of the century — harmonically, rhythmically, 
and texturally. Beginning around 1900, some composers who were influenced 
by innovative ideas in poetry and painting — specifically, so-called symbol-
ist ideas, in which reality is rejected and symbols (indirect suggestions) are 
used to express ideas — threw out the old rules of music and began express-
ing themselves using a whole new musical language. At first listeners were 
shocked by what they heard, but eventually, they began to find some of the 
work quite expressive and beautiful.

442
Book V: Classical Guitar 
The most famous of the symbolist-influenced composers, Claude Debussy 
(1862–1918), developed a new musical language at the end of the Romantic 
era to express his ideas. His style of music, like the style of such painters 
as Claude Monet and Pierre Auguste Renoir, is known as impressionism. 
Impressionistic works, whether of painting or music, are meant to evoke 
indistinct sensory impressions rather than convey realism. As Debussy him-
self explained: “Every sound perceived by the acute ear in the rhythm of the 
world about us can be represented musically. Some people wish above all to 
conform to the rules; I wish only to render what I can hear.”
Debussy liked to stir his listeners’ imaginations by painting a mood or sug-
gesting beautiful images of nature. He did this by employing unusual scales 
(the whole tone scale, for example, in which all tones are separated by a 
whole step), unusual chords (extended chords of the 9th, 11th, and 13th, for 
example), parallel intervals (such as parallel 4ths or 5ths, which earlier com-
posers eschewed), nebulous rhythms (in which it’s sometimes not clear what 
the basic pulse is or how it’s subdivided), and ambiguous tonalities (where 
you can’t tell what key, if any, a piece is in).
Although he was a contemporary of other late-Romantic/early-Modern 
composers such as Ravel (with whom he is often compared), Debussy’s 
music was truly revolutionary in that it sounded nothing like anything heard 
before. It was his rejection of the traditional approach to harmony, his com-
plete departure from the aesthetic of his forebears, and his forward-looking 
approach that challenged the very idea of tonality itself that paved the way 
for 20th-century composers such as Bartók and Stravinsky and the modern 
era of classical music.
Because of their often complex harmonies, many of Debussy’s compositions 
are difficult to play on guitar; however, a few, notably his most famous work, 
“Clair de Lune,” have found their way into the classical guitar repertoire. 
Figures 4-8 and 4-9 show short passages from two other Debussy works (orig-
inally for piano) that guitarists sometimes play.
In the first passage, from “The Little Shepherd” (a section of 1908’s Children’s 
Corner Suite), note how dissonant chords exist in their own right, with no 
need for resolution, and the lack of a tonal center (Figure 4-8).
The second passage is from Debussy’s 1910 prelude “The Girl with the Flaxen 
Hair” (Figure 4-9). Note how in the first two measures he uses the interval of 
a tritone (an interval three whole steps in distance, as C to F# or D to G#) to 
obscure the key center but how in the last three measures he changes the 
mood by firmly establishing the key of D (the original piano version is in G%).

Putting the Major Scales 
to Use in Your Playing
In This Chapter
 Playing major scales using five patterns
 Performing pieces using the major scales
P
racticing scales may sound boring, but it’s a discipline that guitarists 
use to perfect their technique, especially their right-hand technique. 
Think about this: Classical guitar great Andrés Segovia recommended prac-
ticing scales two hours a day! We don’t ask that much, but for guitarists who 
use a pick, rather than their fingers and nails, these scales are an excellent 
medium to work on alternate picking.
Most music is based on scales. So if you learn and memorize where the scale 
patterns and positions are, your fingers will know what to do when you see a 
scale in music. Playing whole passages of notes becomes automatic.
So how do you get to such a place? By taking common scale patterns and 
playing them repeatedly until you know them cold. “Practice makes perfect,” 
the saying goes, and it’s true. You not only memorize the notes through 
repeated playings, but you gradually increase the strength and elasticity of 
your fingers, which allows you to play more difficult music later on. Sound 
like exercise? Well, it is, except that it’s exercise for your fingers and your 
brain. And just like swimming, running, or biking, you need to do it several 
times a week to improve. For learning guitar, it’s best to practice every day, 
even if you can manage only a little on some days.
In this chapter, you discover five patterns for playing the major scale. Each 
pattern has its own particular advantages, which we touch on along the way. 
At the end of the chapter, you get a bonus: real pieces of music to play that 
use the patterns.

448
Book VI: Exercises: Practice, Practice, Practice 
 
After you memorize each fingering pattern in this chapter, simply move it up 
or down the neck to a different starting note to produce other major scales. 
The familiar do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do sound (think Maria von Trapp and The 
Sound of Music here) stays the same, but as you switch positions, the key, or 
letter name, of the scale changes.
Practicing Five Major Scale Patterns
You can play major scales in position (meaning that the left-hand fingers 
cover four consecutive frets and that the position is named for the fret 
played by the first finger) by applying five unique fingerings. So, with 12 
major scales and five fingering options for each scale, you’re looking at 60 
major scales in position. All of these options are what make the guitar so 
incredibly cool. You can play a lot of music by simply memorizing five pat-
terns, and you can play it many different ways — according to the best pat-
tern for the situation or by changing keys easily while maintaining a pattern. 
These options also show why you need to practice: There’s a lot to master!
 
As you practice, play each major scale from low to high, slowly, loudly, and 
deliberately at first to help develop the muscles in your hand and fingers — 
similar to the way athletes might lift weights. Then play it faster and lighter 
to more closely approach how the music is actually played in performance. 
Just be sure to maintain your starting tempo and dynamic level (loudness) 
throughout the scale.
Major scale pattern #1
Major scale pattern #1 starts with the second finger on the 6th string (see 
Figure 1-1).
Notice that the first note of the exercise has a fingering indication in the 
music staff. What we’re talking about is the small 2 to the left of the A note-
head. This indicator tells you to use your left-hand second finger to play that 
note. Keep in mind that the second finger is actually one fret higher than the 
name of the position (which is always defined as the fret number that the 
first finger plays). Practice this pattern as many times as you need to in order 
to feel comfortable playing it.

After you can adeptly finger this pattern in all keys, practice it in rhythm 
using the exercise shown in Figure 1-2. This exercise is in the key of G major 
in 2nd position and in ascending and descending eighth notes. Play it in a 
steady beat (using a metronome or a foot tap) and try to make the music 
flow. The exercise may be “just a scale,” but you can still make it musical by 
employing accents (striking the string slightly harder on certain notes, usu-
ally on the beat), and varying the length of the notes from sustained (called 
legato) to crisp and clipped (staccato).

Try major scale pattern #1 in the key of B% major in 5th position in ascending 
and descending eighth-note triplets, as shown in Figure 1-3. In actual music 
(versus just scales), you encounter many different types of rhythms, not just 
eighth notes. So playing scales in triplets helps you mix things up a bit, rhyth-
mically speaking. Try to give your triplets a skipping or lilting feel.

Figure 1-4 shows major scale pattern #1 in the key of C major in 7th position

even numbers (from the triplets of the previous exercise), but the notes now 
come four to the beat instead of two. So play these 16th notes a little faster 
than you would play eighth notes. This way you get used to playing quickly 
as well as moderately.

Major scale pattern #2
Major scale pattern #2 starts with the fourth finger on the 6th string and 
includes one out-of-position note on the 4th string. An out-of-position note is 
one that doesn’t fall within the four-fret span defined by the position and that 
requires a stretch to play. You must stretch up (higher on the neck, toward 
the bridge) with your fourth finger to reach this note, because it occurs one 
fret above where the finger naturally falls.
 
Wherever these patterns contain out-of-position notes, pay special attention, 
because these spots are where you might play a wrong note or just have trou-
ble playing the right one correctly. If you can’t perform the out-of-position note 
correctly, try isolating the passage with the problem note and playing it a few 
times by itself. Then play the whole pattern from start to finish.
Figure 1-5 shows major scale pattern #2 in the key of C major in both a neck 
diagram and in music and tab format. Note that in addition to the starting 
finger next to the first note in the music (a 4 to the left of the notehead), 
another fingering indication is included where an out-of-position note occurs 
(a 4 next to the 4th-string note B at the 9th fret). Throughout this book, we 
indicate fingerings for any out-of-position notes. Also, we provide the finger-
ings for subsequent notes if we think there’s a chance you might use the 
wrong finger. Figure 1-5 is just such a case! Practice this pattern as many 
times as you need to in order to make all the notes sound smooth and effort-
less. When you use the correct fingerings automatically, you know you’re on 
the right track.

After you can successfully finger this pattern in all keys, practice it in rhythm. 
Figure 1-6 shows major scale pattern #2 in the key of B% major in 3rd position 
in ascending and descending eighth-note triplets. Don’t be afraid of the flats 
in the key signature of this exercise. We know, usually guitar music is writ-
ten in “guitar-friendly” keys, which contain sharps in the key signature. But 
because you’re learning patterns that can be moved around and played in 
any key with equal ease, a flat key is no more difficult than a sharp key or a 
key with no flats or sharps at all!

Major scale pattern #3
Patterns #1 and #2 have a range of two octaves, going from bottom to top. 
Major scale patterns #3, #4, and #5, on the other hand, span a bit less than 
two octaves. Playing just a single octave may seem a bit short, so in these 
patterns, as well as other patterns that span less than two complete octaves, 
we go as high as the position will allow.
Figure 1-7 shows major scale pattern #3, which starts on the 5th string (not 
the 6th as in patterns #1 and #2). The pattern is in the key of D major and is 
shown in both a neck diagram and in music and tab format. Notice that in 
addition to the starting finger next to the first note in the music (a 2 to the 
left of the notehead), we include the fingering for the out-of-position note (a 1 
next to the 1st-string note G at the 3rd fret). In this stretch, unlike the stretch 
of pattern #2, you reach down (toward the nut) instead of up. This move 
helps you get used to stretching in both directions. Practice this pattern as 
many times as you need to in order to feel as confident starting a scale on the 
5th string as you do on the 6th string.

After you can confidently play this pattern starting on any 5th-string note, 
practice it in rhythm with Figure 1-8 which shows major scale pattern #3 in 
the key of F major in 7th position in ascending and descending 16th notes. 
Because this exercise is in 16th notes (which are relatively fast compared to 
eighth notes or triplets), play it slowly at first to make sure the notes come at 
a steady rate. After that you can gradually speed up.

Major scale pattern #4
Like pattern #3, major scale pattern #4 also begins and ends on the 5th string. 
This time, though, your starting finger is the fourth finger. The good news is 
that this position has no out-of-position notes (hooray!). So if you feel up to 
it, you can play the exercises using major scale pattern #4 with a little more 
brio (that’s music-speak for speed) than the patterns that require stretches.
Figure 1-9 shows major scale pattern #4 in the key of F major in both a neck 
diagram and in music and tab format. Because this pattern is in the middle 
of the neck and has no out-of-position notes, you may want to jump right in 
and play a little faster. Whenever you try an exercise a little faster than you 
normally would, take a moment to prepare. Then play the entire exercise 
completely. Don’t get into the habit of making “false starts,” which is an indi-
cation that your fingers are ahead of your brain.

When you’re ready, try the exercise shown in Figure 1-10 in rhythm. This 
figure shows major scale pattern #4 in the key of G major in 7th position. This 
exercise is an easy one. It’s up the neck (where the frets are nicely snuggled 
together for comfortable playing), it’s in eighth notes (which are a little easier 
to play than triplets or 16th notes), and there are no out-of-position notes to 
stretch for. So try playing this exercise fast from the get-go. You may surprise 
yourself by playing a lot faster than you think you can. Just be sure whenever 
you play fast that you don’t rush (or play ahead of the tempo). When some-
thing seems easy, it’s tempting to keep accelerating until you reach your limit. 
But you have to stay with the tempo established at the outset.

Major scale pattern #5
Major scale pattern #5 is a four-string pattern whose lowest note is on the 4th 
string. The pattern starts with the first finger on the 4th string and includes 
an out-of-position note that occurs on the 4th string. You have to stretch 
your fourth finger higher on the neck (toward the bridge) to reach this note, 
because it occurs one fret above where the finger naturally falls.
Figure 1-11 shows major scale pattern #5 in the key of G major in both a neck 
diagram and in music and tab format. The stretch for the out-of-position note 
comes right away — on the first string you play — so watch out for it. First 
practice the stretch in isolation and then try the full pattern. Play this pat-
tern as many times as you need to in order to get it sounding as strong as the 
other four major scale patterns.

Applying Your Scale Work 
to Actual Pieces of Music
Okay, so you’ve practiced, and now you realize that playing scales on a guitar 
is about as interesting as watching paint dry, right? Well, don’t you drop your 
flatpick and grab knitting needles just yet. You’ve made it to the fun part 
where you get to use your scale-playing prowess to play actual music — you 
know, songs! It’s our reward to you for all the effort you’ve put in so far.
 
After you get the five major scale patterns “under your fingers” (musician 
lingo for knowing them cold), you can make those patterns work for you. It 
bears repeating that most music is made up of scales. And although you may 
not encounter a lot of music that runs a scale from bottom to top and back 
down again in eighth notes, you will play many pieces that contain passages 
of scale segments — the same material you practice here. When you run 
across a passage that’s similar to a scale you’ve practiced, it’s like the music 
almost plays itself. You can go into a kind of automatic pilot and enjoy listen-
ing to the music as it goes by.
As you practice scales more and more, you’ll find that playing passages of 
stepwise notes becomes easier and more natural. Scales are an efficient way 
to practice the notes contained in a song — even if the melody doesn’t lay 
them out in a strict, regular fashion. In fact, most music isn’t laid out in a 
strict, regular way because it would be boring and sound like, well, scales. So 
while practicing scales may not prepare you for a particular piece of music, 
it’s the best way to prepare yourself equally well for most music. The follow-
ing sections include two pieces of music whose melodies are made up of pri-
marily major scale passages.
“The First Noël”
“The First Noël” is a Christmas carol that you probably know, so you can use 
your familiarity with it to help ensure that you’re playing the song correctly — 
hitting the right pitches in the correct rhythms.
You use two major scale patterns to play “The First Noël”: major scale pat-
terns #1 and #4. To begin, put your hand in 2nd position (with your left-hand 
first finger hovering above the 2nd fret). Then place your left-hand third 
finger (your ring finger) on the starting note F# at the 4th string, 4th fret. Now 
you’re ready to play.
 
Notice in Figure 1-13 at bar 8 you switch positions, jumping up to 9th position 
between beats 2 and 3. Try to let that half note ring for as long as possible 
before making the jump, but don’t be late for beat 3! This mid-measure jump 
allows you to play the chorus of the second phrase an octave higher. The 

460
Book VI: Exercises: Practice, Practice, Practice 
song doesn’t really do that, but we thought we’d make it more interesting for 
you. Plus it gives you a workout in different positions.
After playing eight bars in the upper octave, shift your hand back to 2nd posi-
tion at bar 16 to finish out the last eight bars. Note that the last bar, like the 
first pickup bar, is incomplete. It contains two beats, which allows it to even 
out the one-beat bar that starts the song. You can repeat the song by men-
tally stitching together the first bar and the last as if the whole song were a 
repeatable loop.

“The First 
Noël” is a

to practice

Bach’s “Minuet in G Major”
J. S. Bach, a classical composer who lived and wrote during the Baroque era 
(1600–1750), originally wrote “Minuet in G Major” as a simple piano piece for 
student pianists (a group that included his wife). Despite its simplicity, the 
song’s melody has become universal. It even made its way into pop music in 
the 1965 hit by The Toys, “A Lover’s Concerto.”
As the title notes, Bach’s minuet is in the key G major. The song begins in 
9th position, and the starting note is the fourth finger. To begin, place your 
left-hand first finger hovering above the 9th fret, and then plant your fourth 
finger on the starting note G on the 4th string, 12th fret.
Notice at the beginning of Bach’s minuet (shown in Figure 1-14), you see a 
repeat sign (the combination of thick and thin vertical lines with two dots) 
in addition to the usual information. In a piece of music, this sign tells you 
that you repeat some portion of the song. So look for a corresponding repeat 
sign that defines the ending and outlines the passage for repeating. In Bach’s 
minuet, the ending sign comes at the end of bar 8. But this repeat uses first 
and second endings, indicated by the lines with “1.” and “2.” above the music. 
For music with first and second endings, you play only the first ending the 
first time through and only the second ending the second time through.
Bach’s original work has a section of music that we cut in the interest of 
brevity. At bar 11, the final section begins, and you switch positions so that 
you play major scale pattern #1 in 2nd position. The passage leads off with 
some string skipping, so make sure your right hand plays the correct strings. 
Notice that between bar 11, beat 3, and bar 12, beat 2, three notes in a row 
are all played on the same fret with the same finger (the fourth) but on differ-
ent strings.
 
You have a choice of how to play these. You can do either of the following to 
play the 2nd-string note:
 
 Use the tip of your fourth finger and “hop” to the different strings
 
 Play the first note with the tip, as usual, and then flatten out your 
finger, forming a mini-barre (a partial barre that covers just two or three 
strings)
Many real-world situations call for the “flattening” approach, but in the case 
of Bach’s minuet, the tempo is slow enough that you can play the notes com-
fortably by finger hopping if you’d like.

Chapter 2
Adding Major Scale Sequences 
to Your Repertoire
In This Chapter
 Playing major scale sequences using five major scale patterns
 Applying sequences to actual pieces of music
I
f you’ve practiced the five major scale patterns presented in Chapter 1 in 
Book VI — and drilled them into your consciousness — it’s time to have 
some fun with them, don’t you think? Instead of going up and down and up 
and down (and up and down), in this chapter you get to mix things up by 
playing sequences. Sequences are musical patterns — not finger patterns like 
the ones you memorized to learn your scales (uh, you did memorize these, 
didn’t you?).
Playing sequences not only makes practicing more interesting and less pre-
dictable, but it also makes you feel like you’re playing real music — that is, 
pattern-based songs with repeated gestures. Many melodies get their “memo-
rableness” from their sequences, which make them different enough to be 
interesting, but predictable enough to become recognizable. It’s a delicate 
balance, but all great melodies have some repetition to them in the form of 
sequences, which you can explore in this chapter.
 
Just as you did in your scale work in Chapter 1 in Book VI, familiarize your-
self with the sequences in this chapter and then move them up and down 
the neck to produce other major scale sequences in different keys. If you 
aren’t sure how the notes lay out on the fretboard, take a look at the guitar 
neck diagram on the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book. It shows the letter 
names of all the frets on all six strings.

464
Book VI: Exercises: Practice, Practice, Practice 
Practicing Major Scale Sequences
Unlike scales, which run in the same direction for long stretches, sequences 
change direction often and may at first seem a little trickier than scales. But 
you can make them more manageable by discovering the scheme (or pat-
tern), which reveals itself in the first few notes you play. Learning the pattern 
can help you better anticipate the direction changes and find the starting 
note of the new sequence. You may have to start off practicing sequences 
a little slower than you would scales, but you’ll soon find that learning the 
sequence helps your brain keep up with your fingers, allowing you to play 
faster.
 
You should always play the ascending and descending sequences as a pair. 
In other words, always begin the descending sequence immediately after you 
finish the ascending one. Doing so will help you maintain a sense of ascend-
ing and descending symmetry in your music.
Major scale sequences using pattern #1
Major scale pattern #1 is an ascending two-octave scale that starts on the 
6th string and contains no out-of-position notes (notes that don’t fall within 
the four-fret span defined by the position and that require stretches by the 
first or fourth finger to play). Even though you have no stretches to contend 
with, you still may want to start out slowly as you play this pattern. After all, 
the notes change direction often and are quite different from the “one-way” 
motion (all up and then all down) of scale playing.
Figure 2-1 features ascending and descending four-note sequences. In the 
ascending version, between bars 5 and 6, you must use the same finger (the 
fourth in this case) to play two notes in a row, across two strings. This may 
feel awkward at first, so feel free to supply your own alternate fingering in 
these cases. For example, try flattening out your fourth finger into a mini-
barre (a partial barre that covers just two or three strings), or try substitut-
ing your third finger for the note played on the 3rd string. Just be sure to get 
back into position as soon as you can after employing an alternate fingering. 
And remember the old saying, “You can break the rules as long as you know 
the rules first.”

Figure 2-2 shows ascending and descending sequences in the key of G in 2nd 
position. This exercise includes a wide skip after every sixth note, sometimes 
requiring you to jump over a string in the process. Practice these wide skips 
across two strings so you can play them with the same smoothness as you play 
a step on the same string. One trick that helps ensure smooth skip execution is 
to look ahead in the music slightly to help you anticipate the next interval.

Major scale sequences using pattern #2
Major scale pattern #2 starts with the fourth finger on the 6th string and 
includes an out-of-position note on the 4th string. Stretch your fourth finger up 
(toward the bridge) to play this note, because it occurs one fret above (higher

on the neck) the note the fourth finger would normally play. Be sure to play 
stretch notes with the same smoothness as you play the in-position notes.
Figure 2-3 shows ascending and descending sequences in the key of C in 
5th position. The sequences are three notes in one direction followed by 
a change in the opposite direction of one step. These frequent changes of 
direction require you to glue your eyeballs to the page to make sure you 
handle the twists and turns of the melodic line.

Note that in bar 2 of this figure we indicate the fingering for notes 3, 4, and 5 
as 4, 3, 4 — as dictated by major scale pattern #2. In reality, however, most 
guitarists would play this passage with fingers 4, 2, 4. That fingering is a little 
easier on your hand with regard to stretching, but you have to be careful not to 
get out of position. When you find other opportunities in this book for alter-
nate fingerings, you’re welcome to use them. Just be sure you can get back 
on track for the rest of the sequence using the correct fingers according to 
the scale pattern.
Figure 2-4 shows ascending and descending sequences in the key of B% in 3rd 
position. These sequences contain no skips and are in 16th notes, so try play-
ing them at a fairly brisk clip. Just because you’re practicing these sequences 
doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be playing fast — even if the music is still new 
or unfamiliar to you. Real music is often played fast, so at times you should 
practice fast, too.

Major scale sequences using pattern #3
Major scale pattern #3 starts with the second finger on the 5th string and 
includes an out-of-position note, which occurs on the 1st string. Play this 
note by stretching down (toward the nut) with your first finger.
Practice the following ascending and descending sequences, which are in the key 
of D in 4th position. The exercise in Figure 2-5 starts with a skip right out of the 
gate — so watch out. Isolate the skip, if necessary. Beyond that, these exercises 
have a healthy amount of skip activity in and around the stepwise motion. It may 
help to memorize this pattern quickly. Then you can focus on the fretboard, 
which can help you play the mixture of skips and steps more accurately.

Figure 2-6 shows ascending and descending sequences in the key of F in 7th 
position. There’s only one skip in this sequence, which occurs immediately 
at the beginning. So work on speed and smoothness by playing at brighter 
tempos. In the ascending version in bar 2, consider an alternate fingering, 
such as flattening out your fourth finger to play both notes 13 and 14 at the 
10th fret. In the descending version, try the same approach at bar 1 between 
notes 13 and 14.

Major scale sequences using pattern #4
Major scale pattern #4 starts with the fourth finger on the 5th string and con-
tains no out-of-position notes. So feel free to play these exercises with a swift 
and light feel, if you like.
In Figure 2-7 you see ascending and descending sequences in the key of F 
in 5th position. Because of the way the guitar’s strings are tuned (in 4ths, 
mostly), this sequence has many same-fret hops between strings (first seen 
in the ascending version between notes 4 and 5). So you have plenty of 
opportunities to swap out mini-barres for these cases. You have permission 
to use them at will.

Figure 2-8 shows ascending and descending sequences in the key of G in 7th 
position. Only the last note of each sequence is approached by a skip (and a 
small one at that, a 3rd). So try playing these up to (or nearly up to) tempo 
right from the get-go. Playing new music fast and accurately is a skill you can 
develop, and this is a good sequence to try that approach on.

Major scale sequences using pattern #5
Major scale pattern #5 starts on the 4th string and includes an out-of-position 
note on the 4th string. Remember, this stretch comes right away — on the 
first string you play, and you have to reach up (toward the bridge) with your 
fourth finger to play the out-of-position note.
Figure 2-9 includes ascending and descending sequences in the key of G in 5th 
position. These sequences are fairly easy sequences to play for three reasons:
 
 The same-direction nature of the melody
 
 The absence of skips
 
 As luck would have it, the lack of any same-fret string-hopping situations
Put your metronome on presto — if you dare.

the first and second notes. You can breathe easy after that, however, because 
the remaining notes are stepwise, including the note that connects one 
sequence to the next.

Putting Your Sequence Skills 
to Work with a Few Songs
The two pieces in the following sections feature melodies that are based on 
sequences. In these songs, you’ll also see scalar passages. After all, most 
music that contains sequences also includes scale-like material. But don’t 
think of these songs as exercises or sequences. They’re songs! Sure you’re 
supposed to practice them, but the idea is to have fun while doing it. Simply 
recognizing that these songs are made up of sequences will increase your 
appreciation of them, deepen your understanding of their structure, and 
make them easier to play.
“Oh, Them Golden Slippers”
When you look at the beginning of “Oh, Them Golden Slippers,” notice the 
elements that give you clues to the song’s character: tempo marking, time 
signature, key signature, and dynamics. (Refer to Chapter 4 in Book I if any of 
these elements are unclear to you.)
“Oh, Them Golden Slippers” has two parts, and you may recognize the first 
part as the melody to the children’s song “Polly Wolly Doodle All the Day.” 
Yes, this children’s song actually derives its melody from the early American 
folk song about valuable footwear.

474
Book VI: Exercises: Practice, Practice, Practice 
“Oh, Them Golden Slippers” is played in A major, starting with major scale 
pattern #2 in 2nd position. (If you need a refresher on any of this information, 
refer to Chapter 1 in Book VI.) This song (shown in Figure 2-11) uses two scale 
patterns, one for each section. Use major scale pattern #2 for the first section, 
and remember that it has one out-of-position note occurring on the 4th string. 
Use pattern #1 (and enjoy the fact that it contains no out-of-position notes) 
for the second section, which begins after the second ending. Also, note that 
because “Oh, Them Golden Slippers” is played down the neck (in the lower 
frets), the frets are wider, making stretches a little more difficult.

Golden

folk song.

A difficult stretch occurs in bar 5, beat 4, where you have to reach out of 
position to play the 4th string, 6th fret (G#). Just make sure you can get back 
into position for the next note — the 3rd string, 2nd fret (A) — which is the 
last note of the bar.
At the second ending of the first section, the music has a quarter rest at 
the end of the bar. You can use this rest as a way of silently switching posi-
tions for the next section, which is played using major scale pattern #1 in 4th 
position.
“We Wish You a Merry Christmas”
We didn’t choose “We Wish You a Merry Christmas” because we’re in a 
holiday mood, but rather because it’s such a great example of a sequential 
melody. The sequences present themselves in neat little two-bar phrases 
right from the beginning.
“We Wish You a Merry Christmas” (shown in Figure 2-12) is played in the key 
of F, using major scale pattern #5 in 3rd position. From bars 3 to 4 and in bar 
8, there’s some first finger string hopping, but the real challenge occurs at 
bars 5 and 6, where the third finger really has to leap around.
 
At the position change in bar 9 (to major scale pattern #4 in 5th position), 
you may notice that you don’t actually have to release your fourth finger to 
play the first note dictated by the new position’s fingering (the C at the 3rd 
string, 5th fret). So you can actually change positions after the text in the 
score tells you to. Little tricks like these help guitarists to play more legato 
(smoothly) where the notes connect or blend into one another slightly 
(versus staccato, where the notes sound separated and slightly choppy). 
These tricks also help musicians find economy in their hand movements that 
may not always be written into the music.

Chapter 3
Tackling the Three Minor Scales
In This Chapter
 Practicing natural, melodic, and harmonic minor scales using five patterns
 Performing pieces using the three minor scales
E
ven though major scales rule the cosmos (see Chapters 1 and 2 in Book VI), 
life would be pretty dull without their darker counterparts: minor scales. 
Minor scales and minor keys are sometimes described as “sad,” “forebod-
ing,” “mysterious,” “haunting,” and even “creepy.” But minor scales can also 
be quite beautiful, and most music — even if it’s in a major key — uses some 
minor material to convey a richer message.
As a guitar student studying and perfecting scales, you have three differ-
ent versions of minor scales that you must tackle. With the major scale, you 
have only one. The three minor scale flavors are called natural, melodic, and 
harmonic. They all have the characteristic “mournful” quality, which is char-
acterized by the flatted 3rd degree (meaning, the third note of the scale is a 
half-step lower than in the major scale). However, some of their other notes 
are altered (namely, the 6th and 7th degrees of the scale), depending on the 
musical context. The three pieces at the end of this chapter each explore a 
different minor scale. For now, though, don’t worry about altered degrees 
and such; just focus on getting the notes under your fingers. This chapter 
helps you do exactly that.
 
If you’re looking for even more practice, remember that after you memorize 
each scale’s fingering pattern you can simply move it up or down the neck 
to different starting notes to produce and practice other minor scales. That 
way, you can hear how the minor scale sounds in all 12 keys using just one 
pattern — instead of learning 11 new ones.

478
Book VI: Exercises: Practice, Practice, Practice 
Familiarizing Yourself with 
Natural Minor Scales
Even though a minor scale produces a decidedly different musical mood than 
a major scale, you treat it the same way when you sit down to practice. It’s 
not like you have to be nicer to a minor scale because it seems so gloomy. 
Approach minor scales with the same vigor and positive attitude as major 
scales; they can take it.
As far as placing your fingers on the frets and playing your right hand in 
rhythm, minor scales are no different from major scales. The only wrinkle is 
that there are three types of minor scales (compared to just one major scale), 
so you have more information to keep track of. And that means you may have 
to spend a little more time memorizing them.
 
Compared to the major scale — the familiar do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do, or 
playing from C to C using all white notes on the piano — the natural minor 
scale has three notes that are different: the 3rd, the 6th, and the 7th degrees. 
These notes are flatted, or lowered a half-step. So a C natural minor scale 
would be C, D, E%, F, G, A%, B%, C.
 
Play each of the following natural minor scale patterns slowly, loudly, and 
deliberately at first to build strength and confidence in your fingers. Then try 
playing it faster and lighter to better simulate how you’ll play minor scales 
in actual pieces of music. Just be sure to maintain your starting tempo and 
dynamic level (loudness) throughout each scale.
Natural minor scale pattern #1
Natural minor scale pattern #1 starts with the first finger on the 6th string. 
As you play this scale pattern, watch for the out-of-position note that occurs 
on the 4th string. (An out-of-position note is a note that doesn’t fall within the 
four-fret span defined by the position and that requires a stretch by the first 
or fourth finger to play it.) You must stretch up (toward the bridge) with 
your fourth finger to reach this note, because it occurs one fret above (higher 
on the neck) where the finger naturally falls.

Figure 3-1 shows an A natural minor scale in 5th position in both a neck dia-
gram and in music and tab format. Take a look at the standard notation for a 
moment to see that we indicate both the starting finger (a 1 at the first note 
for the first finger) and the fingering for the out-of-position note (a 4 next 
to the B on the 4th string, 7th fret). Use the figure to memorize this scale’s 
fingering pattern, and then practice it until you feel comfortable playing it. 
Practice this pattern several times slowly to make sure you can hear the 
notes that produce the minor quality as well as to get your fingers comfort-
able with playing a new scale.

Be sure not to unduly emphasize the out-of-position note (4th string, 11th 
fret). Some guitar players fall into the bad habit of musically stressing the 
difficult parts, such as stretches and position shifts. The out-of-position note 
here is like any other note in the scale and should blend in. The listener 
shouldn’t be aware that the guitarist is doing something difficult.
Natural minor scale pattern #2
Natural minor scale pattern #2 starts with the fourth finger on the 6th string 
and includes an out-of-position note on the 1st string. Because this note 
occurs one fret below (lower on the neck) where the finger naturally falls, 
you must stretch down (toward the nut) with your first finger to reach it.
In Figure 3-3 you find the neck diagram and corresponding music and tab 
for natural minor scale pattern #2 in the key of C minor. Notice that in the 
standard notation we include both the starting finger (fourth finger) and the 
fingering where the out-of-position note occurs (a 1 next to the A% on the 1st 
string, 4th fret). Practice this pattern so you can play the out-of-position note 
as smoothly as you play the other notes of the scale.
When you’re ready, try playing this pattern in rhythm. The exercise in 
Figure 3-4 is in the key of A minor in 2nd position. Notice that the out-of-position 
note occurs on the F on the 1st string, 1st fret. Because this stretch occurs low 
on the neck, where the frets are wider, you really have to have your left hand 
warmed up. Try isolating the passage that occurs between bar 1, beat 4, and 
bar 2, beat 2, and play it eight times, or until you get used to the stretch.

Natural minor scale pattern #3
Natural minor scale pattern #3 starts with the first finger on the 5th string 
(not the 6th, as in the previous two patterns) and includes no out-of-position 
notes. Sometimes it takes a little more “aim” to place a finger on the 5th string 
because it’s an inside string (that is, not on the edge of the neck like the 6th 
string, which is easier to find by feeling your way around). So just before you’re 
ready to put your finger down, make sure you’re eyeballing that 5th string.
In Figure 3-5, you see the neck diagram and corresponding music and tab for 
natural minor scale pattern #3 in the key of D minor. Because this pattern 
includes no out-of-position notes — which can slow you down because they 
take extra effort — you can try taking this pattern a little faster than you nor-
mally would. Be careful not to rush it and make mistakes, though. Practice 
this pattern until you feel you know it well enough to play it in a steady 
tempo with no mistakes.

Now try the rhythm exercise in Figure 3-6, in the key of E minor in 7th posi-
tion. Be sure to play the 16th notes evenly and smoothly at first. Then, if you 
like, try accenting (striking slightly harder) the first note of each beat group. 
Applying accents helps to delineate the beat, which adds drive to your music.

Natural minor scale pattern #4
Natural minor scale pattern #4 starts on the 5th string with the fourth finger 
and includes an out-of-position note on the 1st string. In Figure 3-7, you can 
see the neck diagram and corresponding music and tab for natural minor 
scale pattern #4 in the key of F minor. Notice that in the standard notation, 
in addition to the starting finger (fourth finger), we put in the fingering where 
the out-of-position note occurs (a 1 next to the A% on the 1st string, 4th fret).
You may find it difficult at first to lead off a scale with the fourth finger, 
because it’s traditionally a weaker and “less confident” finger than the first or 
second finger (the fingers that begin natural minor scale patterns #1 and #3). 
So practice the beginning of this pattern (just the first three or four notes) a 
few times to make sure you kick it off steadily and confidently before playing 
the rest of the pattern.
When you’re ready to try this pattern in rhythm, check out Figure 3-8, which 
is in the key of D minor in 2nd position. In this rhythm exercise, notice that 
an out-of-position note occurs on the F on the 1st string, 1st fret.
 
A stretch to the 1st fret is a wide one, so try measuring it first by placing your 
fourth finger on the 2nd string, 5th fret. While still holding your fourth finger 
down, reach up and place your first finger on the 1st string, 1st fret, and 
hold that down, too. That’s the span your hand will have to make when you 
encounter the reach in bar 2. This measuring routine should help you remem-
ber how far to stretch when the time comes, and it’s a little quicker than iso-
lating the passage containing the stretch.

Natural minor scale pattern #5
Natural minor scale pattern #5 starts with your first finger on the 4th string 
and includes no out-of-position notes. Figure 3-9 shows a neck diagram and 
corresponding music and tab for natural minor scale pattern #5 in the key of 
G minor. Because this pattern begins on an inside string (away from the easily 
accessible edges of the guitar), you may want to practice placing your first 
finger quickly on the starting note. The good news is that you’re back to begin-
ning a scale with a strong finger — the first. Practice grabbing the starting note 
at different points on the neck, naming each starting note as you do, and then 
play through the pattern at least four times to memorize the fingering.

Raising the Bar with Melodic 
Minor Scales
 
Compared to the major scale (for example, C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C in the key of 
C), the ascending melodic minor scale has only one note that’s different: the 
3rd, which is flatted. So an ascending C melodic minor scale would be C, D, 
E%, F, G, A, B, C. The descending melodic minor is the same as the natural 
minor scale, and so it has three notes that are different: the 3rd, 6th, and 7th 
degrees. These are flatted, so a descending C melodic minor scale would be 
C, B%, A%, G, F, E%, D, C.
The raising of the notes on only the ascending version is said to make the 
scale more elegant. Much Baroque and Classical music — undoubtedly 
elegant — often includes melodic minor scales.
Because the 6th and 7th notes are sometimes raised and sometimes not, the 
melodic minor scale can be somewhat tricky to memorize. But that difficulty 
is also what makes it interesting. After all, you simply have more notes avail-
able than with the other major and minor scales. Practice the melodic minor 
scale as you would the natural minor scale, but do be aware of the two scale 
degrees that are different (the 6th and 7th) on the ascending version. Don’t 
make these notes obvious by hitting them harder, either. Give the raised and 
unraised notes equal emphasis.

Melodic minor scale pattern #1
Melodic minor scale pattern #1 begins on the 6th string with the first finger. 
Figure 3-11 shows the neck diagram and corresponding music and tab for the 
pattern. Because the melodic minor scale has two forms — one for ascending 
and one for descending — we include two neck diagrams side by side.

The ascending form of the melodic minor scale pattern #1 includes out-of-
position notes on the 5th, 4th, and 2nd strings. The descending form includes 
just one out-of-position note, on the 4th string. We indicate the fingerings for 
these notes in the standard notation. Between the ascending and descending 
versions you have a fair amount of stretching to do here, so make sure you’re 
limbered up before trying this one.
 
Because only the top part of the scale (between the 6th and octave notes) 
presents the raised and unraised notes, you need to isolate the passage from 
the high E (2nd string, 5th fret) to the high A (1st string, 5th fret), ascending 
and descending. Play the passage eight times in a row at a slow tempo before 
trying the exercise from the beginning. As you memorize the scale, make sure 
your fingers don’t get confused as to which notes they’re supposed to play 
on the ascent versus the descent. Practice this pattern both up and down so 
you memorize the difference between the two versions of the scale.
Figure 3-12 shows an exercise in rhythm in the key of G minor in 3rd position. 
Play the eighth notes with a light and quick feel, just as you would with the 
natural minor scale, and work so you can negotiate the altered notes here 
with equal ease.

The melodic minor scale is different on the way down. So if you’ve become 
used to coasting on the descending versions of other scales, you’ll have to 
pay more attention here!

Melodic minor scale pattern #2
Melodic minor scale pattern #2 starts with the fourth finger on the 6th string 
and includes two out-of-position notes. One of these notes occurs when 
ascending (on the 4th string) and one occurs when descending (on the 
1st string).
Figure 3-13 shows the neck diagrams in ascending and descending forms 
along with the corresponding music and tab for melodic minor scale pattern 
#2 in the key of C minor. Notice that in the standard notation, in addition 
to the starting finger (fourth finger), we put in the fingerings where the out-
of-position notes occur. So not only is the scale different depending on the 
direction you’re going, but the out-of-position notes change as well. Melodic 
minor scales are really two scales under one name. That means two times 
the effort to learn, but two times the possibilities for musical variety! Practice 
this pattern along with natural minor scale pattern #1, if you want; they’re 
identical in their descending versions.

Melodic minor scales require you to think, stretch, and keep track of where 
the different out-of-position notes fall. Are you staying relaxed through this 
process? Don’t tense up, even if you have to stretch your fingers and think 
fast to ensure correctly played notes. And whatever you do, keep breathing!
Melodic minor scale pattern #3
Melodic minor scale pattern #3 starts with the first finger on the 5th string. 
The ascending form contains an out-of-position note on the 4th string. You 
must stretch up (toward the bridge) with the fourth finger to play this note. 
The descending form, which is the same as natural minor scale pattern #3, 
contains no out-of-position notes.
In Figure 3-15 you find the neck diagrams as well as the corresponding music 
and tab for this scale pattern in the key of D minor in both ascending and 
descending forms. Note the unusual stretch here: You play the out-of-position 
note with the fourth finger, but the next note is played with the second finger

(not the first, as you may expect). Stretching between the fourth and second 
fingers is a little more difficult than between the fourth and first fingers, so 
practice the move from the 4th to the 3rd string two or three times before play-
ing the entire pattern.
Ready to put this pattern into play? If so, check out the exercise in Figure 3-16, 
which is in the key of F# minor in 9th position. Playing this scale higher up the 
neck ensures that the stretch you encounter from playing the out-of-position 
notes is made a little easier because the frets are closer together. So if you 
have any say in the matter, always opt to head north to play this scale. Your 
fingers will thank you for it.

Melodic minor scale pattern #4
Melodic minor scale pattern #4 starts with the fourth finger on the 5th string 
and includes an out-of-position note on the 1st string in both the ascending 
and descending forms.
To see the neck diagrams and corresponding music and tab (in ascending 
and descending forms) for melodic minor scale pattern #4 in the key of F 
minor, check out Figure 3-17. Because the stretch occurs in the same place in 
both the ascending and descending versions, do a quick hand-span measure-
ment (which is discussed in the earlier “Natural minor scale pattern #4” sec-
tion) between the 2nd and 1st strings at the 8th and 4th frets, respectively. 
Then you can jump into the pattern. Watch out for the notes on the 3rd and 
2nd strings, though. They’re different, depending on which direction you’re 
traveling. Practice this pattern a few times, or until you can play the ascend-
ing version as easily as the descending version (which is the same as natural 
minor scale pattern #4, a scale we discuss earlier in this chapter).
Now take a look at Figure 3-18, which provides a rhythm exercise in the key 
of E minor in 4th position. Notice that an out-of-position note occurs on 
the G on the 1st string, 3rd fret. As melodic minor scales go, this pattern is 
relatively accessible because its stretch occurs in only one spot (on the 1st 
string). Practice the stretch first to get your fingers limbered up, and then 
focus on the differences between the ascending and descending version, 
which requires a limber brain.

Melodic minor scale pattern #5
Melodic minor scale pattern #5 begins with the first finger on the 4th string 
and includes no out-of-position notes in either the ascending or descending 
versions. In Figure 3-19, you can see the neck diagram and corresponding 
music and tab in ascending and descending form for melodic minor scale pat-
tern #5 in the key of G minor. Use the figure to memorize this scale’s fingering 
pattern, and practice it several times to ensure that the notes are equally 
smooth and even in either direction.

B% minor is an unusual key for the guitar, because it contains five flats. 
Guitarists generally find themselves in sharp keys (such as G, D, A, and E), 
which are considered more favorable to the instrument. (This relates to the 
open strings of the guitar being the tonics, or starting notes, of sharp keys.) 
And when guitar players do have to play in flat keys, they’re more comfort-
able with keys that have only a few flats (such as F, B%, and E%, which have 
one, two, and three flats, respectively). But one of the advantages of movable 
scale patterns is that they let you explore uncharted territory (including keys 
with lots of flats) without having to learn any new patterns.
Note: The ascending version of the melodic minor is sometimes used in both 
directions, especially in jazz, but examples can be found in Bach as well.
Harmonizing with Harmonic 
Minor Scales
 
Compared to the major scale, the harmonic minor scale has two notes that 
are different: the 3rd and the 6th degrees. These are flatted, so a C harmonic 
minor scale would be C, D, E%, F, G, A%, B, C.
Consider the harmonic minor scale alongside its other minor scale brethren. 
The harmonic minor is different from the natural minor in that the 7th degree 
is raised a half-step. This is true whether the scale is ascending or descend-
ing. This raising of the 7th degree gives the scale’s melody a strong pull from 
the 7th degree to the top of the scale. It also allows for the formation of a 

496
Book VI: Exercises: Practice, Practice, Practice 
dominant 7th chord in the harmony (for example, an E7 chord in the key of A 
minor). For these reasons, the scale is called the “harmonic” minor. After all, 
it allows more desirable chords to be formed from it.
Raising the 7th degree produces a colorful “skip” in the melody between the 
unraised 6th and the raised 7th. Some people think this skip isn’t very scale-
like, but the harmonic minor has a tart flavor and sounds Middle Eastern 
(think snake-charmer music). The harmonic minor scale is the same ascend-
ing and descending, so it should be a little easier to memorize. Practice 
all five patterns of the harmonic minor scale until you can play them as 
smoothly — skip and all — as you do the natural and melodic minor scales.
Harmonic minor scale pattern #1
Harmonic minor scale pattern #1 is an A harmonic minor scale in 5th posi-
tion, starting with the first finger on the 6th string.
Figure 3-21 shows the neck diagram as well as the corresponding music and 
tab. This pattern has out-of-position notes on the 4th and 2nd strings. We 
include fingerings for these notes in the standard notation. The stretch that 
occurs on the 2nd string, between the second and fourth fingers, is unusual, 
so practice playing just the 2nd string notes two or three times before play-
ing the rest of the pattern. Keep in mind that you have another stretch to 
contend with, too — on the 4th string between the third and fourth fingers. 
But this is the kind of stretch you’re used to, so it shouldn’t present an addi-
tional problem, as long as you’re prepared for it.
Try the rhythm exercise in Figure 3-22, which is in the key of C minor and in 
8th position. Before you begin playing, notice where the out-of-position notes 
fall, and be sure to observe the fingering indications.
 
As an option, you can play fingers 1, 2, and 4 on the 4th string (instead of 
fingers 2, 3, 4). This eliminates the stretch that occurs between the third and 
fourth finger, which some people find uncomfortable.

Harmonic minor scale pattern #2
Harmonic minor scale pattern #2 starts with the fourth finger on the 6th string, 
and it includes out-of-position notes on the 4th and 1st strings. You stretch up 
(toward the bridge) with the fourth finger to reach the out-of-position note on 
the 4th string, and you stretch down (toward the nut) with the first finger to 
reach the out-of-position note on the 1st string.
Figure 3-23 shows the neck diagram and corresponding music and tab for 
harmonic minor scale pattern #2 in the key of C minor. In the standard nota-
tion, in addition to the starting finger (fourth finger), we put in the fingerings 
where the out-of-position notes occur. Use these figures to familiarize your-
self with the fingering pattern, and then play it until you know it cold.
To practice this pattern in rhythm, check out Figure 3-24, which is in the key 
of D minor in 7th position. Accent the first note of each triplet to help keep 
your place in the measure.

Harmonic minor scale pattern #3
Harmonic minor scale pattern #3 starts with the first finger on the 5th string 
and includes no out-of-position notes. Lucky you!
Take a look at Figure 3-25, which shows the neck diagram and corresponding 
music and tab for harmonic minor scale pattern #3 in the key of D minor. Be 
careful that you don’t overemphasize the note that’s played with the second 
finger on the 3rd string (the raised 7th). In trying to memorize the sound and 
fingering of the three different minor scales, it’s pretty obvious that the 7th 
note of the scale is the one that adds the “flavor.” But you should work to 
make the attack as even as the rest of the notes of the scale. To ensure that 
you aren’t applying undue emphasis to any particular note, practice this 
pattern in its entirety every time you play it (without isolating specific pas-
sages), and work to make each note equal in volume.

When you have pattern #3 under your belt, practice it in rhythm. To do so, 
consult Figure 3-26, which is in the key of B minor in 2nd position. Playing 
a pattern that has no stretches and is the same ascending as descending 
sounds like an opportunity to give it the gas. Practice this exercise at a bright 
tempo, but be careful that you don’t flub the notes because your fingers are 
going too fast for your brain. Just because you find a scale to be technically 
easy doesn’t mean you won’t make a mistake due to a lapse in concentration.

Harmonic minor scale pattern #4
Harmonic minor scale pattern #4 starts with the fourth finger on the 5th 
string and includes an out-of-position note on the 1st string. You must stretch 
down (toward the nut) with the first finger to play it.
Figure 3-27 shows the neck diagram and corresponding music and tab for har-
monic minor scale pattern #4 in the key of F minor. The first-finger note on 
the 1st string creates a two-fret stretch between the first and second fingers. 
Be aware of this unusual stretch as you approach the 1st string. To limber 
up for the out-of-position note before you encounter it in rhythm, try practic-
ing this pattern descending (from the top note down) first. After you do that 
a couple of times, practice the scale in the normal ascending approach four 
times, or however many times you need to memorize the fingering and feel 
comfortable playing the notes.
When you’re ready for some practice, try your hand at the exercise in 
Figure 3-28, which is in the key of G minor in 7th position. When playing 
eighth notes in 4/4 time, the most important beat is beat 1. The next most 
important is beat 3, followed by beats 2 and 4. Can you play a right-hand 
articulation approach that reflects that? Tip: Don’t make the changes in 
volume between the accented notes and the unaccented ones too drastic, or 
it becomes harder to play an even, steady rhythm.

Harmonic minor scale pattern #5
Harmonic minor scale pattern #5 starts with the first finger on the 4th string 
and includes no out-of-position notes.
To see the neck diagram and corresponding music and tab for harmonic 
minor scale pattern #5 in the key of G minor, refer to Figure 3-29. Because 
this pattern has no stretches to contend with, it’s rather easy to play. So try 
doing something different: Focus on your right hand. If you normally use a 
flatpick, try playing the notes smoothly and evenly by alternating your right-
hand index and middle fingers. Conversely, if you play fingerstyle, try picking 
up a flatpick for this one. (Come on, it won’t kill you to do it! And your clas-
sical guitar teacher doesn’t even have to know.) In either case, approaching 
an exercise from a different perspective often helps you solidify your own 
internal rhythmic sense, so when you go back to the way you would normally 
play, you find new confidence. Practice this pattern using different right-hand 
approaches as a way to see “how the other half lives.”

When you’re ready, practice the pattern using Figure 3-30, which is in the 
key of F# minor in 4th position. Have you ever played in the dark or with your 
eyes closed? It’s a great way to test your muscle memory, and performing 
this experiment on a scale with no out-of-position notes is a good place to 
start. It’s also the acid test for seeing whether you truly have a pattern memo-
rized. Try closing your eyes right now, and see how well you do going up and 
down one time slowly and steadily. No peeking!

Playing Pieces Using the 
Three Minor Scales
Playing minor scales prepares you for the vast underworld of music that for-
sakes major-key optimism and chooses to express itself in darker tones. Just 
as you need both sunshine and rain to make your flowers grow, so too do you 
need a little minor among the major to make your musical garden flourish.
In this section, you get to see what minor-scale music is all about. You 
encounter three major-league compositions, each using a different minor 
scale. One piece is an old traditional carol, one is from the great Baroque 
composer George Frideric Handel, and one is attributed to the Renaissance. 
Enjoy your musical journey to the dark side!
“God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen”
Despite the fact that “God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen” is in a minor key, it’s 
quite spirited and uplifting. The key signature has no sharps or flats, so you 
may think that the song is in C major. But it’s actually in A minor, which 
shares the same key signature and notes as C major. (Now you see why A 
minor is known as the relative minor of C major). This song is composed of 
almost all quarter notes, so you can take it at a pretty brisk tempo. The song 
uses just one pattern, natural minor scale pattern #5, in 7th position, starting 
with the first finger.

Even though we’ve arranged the song using all one scale pattern, some of 
the intervals and direction changes can be tricky. Try playing the song by 
ear (close the book or look away from the music). No peeking, now! See how 
well you do at picking out the correct notes. Even when you know the pattern 
cold, “God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen” (Figure 3-31) can be difficult to per-
form completely accurately because of some of the intervals.

may be

it’s lively.

Handel’s “Allegro”
The opening statement in this piece is just an ascending scale. However, 
you may not even realize it because of the way it’s disguised with different 
rhythms. The faster notes in bars 5 through 7 are all just descending scale 
segments, but do note how beautiful they sound.
Handel’s “Allegro” (Figure 3-32) uses the melodic minor scale pattern #4 in 
7th position, starting with the fourth finger. It’s in the key of G minor and 

506
Book VI: Exercises: Practice, Practice, Practice 
written in cut time (sometimes referred to as 2/2), which is indicated with a C 
and a vertical line “cutting” it in half @ . This symbol tells you to count the half 
note, not the quarter note (as you’re used to doing with songs in 4/4 and 3/4), 
as one beat. Because you count the half note as the beat, the measure is felt 
in 2 (with two beats to the bar).

In bar 3 of this piece, you see two accidentals in the music: an E natural and 
an F sharp. These accidentals indicate that those notes have been raised as 
the melodic minor commands. In bar 5, the melody descends, so the melodic 
minor scale again requires that the E% and F — raised on the way up to E nat-
ural and F# — be in their natural state, as F and E%, which agrees with the key 
signature. For you music readers, we put in the natural and flat signs in bar 5 
just as a gentle reminder not to play the wrong notes. The melody has a nice 
way of building here, using slow notes in the beginning and working up to the 
eighth-note passages in bars 5 through 7.
“The Three Ravens”
If you’re old enough, you may recognize “The Three Ravens” (Figure 3-33) 
from the Peter, Paul, and Mary version of this folk song. The key signature in 
the music tells you that this song is in F minor, but because you’re using the 
harmonic minor scale, every instance of the note E will be E natural, not E% as 
indicated by the key signature.

Because the harmonic scale here is in 1st position and you have some out-
of-position notes to play, you have a pretty serious case of finger stretching 
ahead of you! So first play bars 1 and 2 in isolation. This bit of practice allows 
you to execute the stretch in both an ascending and descending context. 
Practicing these stretching parts ensures that they don’t take you by surprise 
when you try to play the whole piece.

Chapter 4
Building Finger Independence 
with Chord Exercises
In This Chapter
 Playing patterns using outside and inside chords
 Putting together a series of chords
 Performing pieces with chord progressions
C
hords are the rhythm guitar yin to the lead guitar yang. In most musical 
settings, single-note playing is supported by some sort of chord-based 
accompaniment. The great thing about the guitar is that it can play chords or 
single-note leads with equal awesomeness — try doing that with a flute or saxo-
phone. But, because the guitar plays chords as well as single notes, it’s impor-
tant that you keep your chording and melody skills up to snuff. This chapter 
addresses chord playing — with all the notes of the chord sounding together.
As with the single-note exercises, the chord forms presented in this chapter 
are movable — meaning they contain no open strings (strings that are unfret-
ted, with no left-hand finger touching the string at all). So after you can play 
a chord form comfortably, try moving it around the neck to play different 
chords. Doing so changes the letter name of the chord (for example, from A 
to C) but keeps the quality of the chord (major, minor, and so on) the same.
 
You can play the chords in this chapter a number of different ways with the 
right hand, including plucking the individual strings with your fingertips, 
brushing the strings with the backs of your fingernails, and striking the 
notes with a pick. But whether you pluck or strum with the right hand, your 
left-hand approach is the same. Your fingers on your left hand must fret the 
notes in a way that allows the strings to ring clearly, and they must be able 
to change chords — that is, get off the old chord and grab the new chord — 
quickly and imperceptibly (or close to it, anyway). And this must all be done 
at a performance tempo.
The exercises in this chapter are designed to help get your fingers moving 
independently. The bountiful number of useful examples also helps you build 
up strength in the process.

Book VI: Exercises: Practice, Practice, Practice 
Practicing Inversion Patterns
Chords come in many different guises; even chords with the same name can 
be played in various ways. For example, you can play an F major chord on 
the guitar in exactly one billion and seven ways. Okay, that’s a bit of an exag-
geration. But trust us, you can find lots of chord options on the neck.
The first way you can narrow down the F major chord choices is to organize 
them by the low-to-high order of their notes. An F major chord is spelled 
F-A-C, bottom note to top. But the notes A-C-F and C-F-A are also F chords. 
Any chord with the combination of the notes F, A, and C constitutes an F 
chord, but if the lowest note of the chord is anything but an F, it’s called an 
inversion of F. So we introduce you to an F (with an F on the bottom), its first 
inversion (with an A on the bottom), and its second inversion (with a C on 
the bottom).
In addition to the order of notes from bottom to top, you can also group 
chords by which strings they’re played on. For example, you can play a chord 
using all six strings (as you do with a basic open E), just the top five strings, 
just the top four strings, or any other combination of strings.
 
Playing all six strings may make the guitar sound full and complete in one 
setting, but it’s not always appropriate — especially if you’re playing in a 
band or with other instruments. (Playing all six strings all the time can sound 
too full and can muddy up the texture and crowd out other instruments, such 
as the bass. It can be cumbersome to play, too.) Sometimes four-string chords 
are just right.
So here we employ two groups of four-string chords, nicknamed outside 
chords and inside chords.
 
 Outside forms refer to the top four strings that reach the outside, or 
edge, of the fretboard. Outside chords don’t include bass notes and are 
good for melody playing and supplying a higher harmonic part.
 
 Inside forms — at least for the purposes of this chapter (the term can have 
other meanings) — are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th strings (which are insulated 
from the outside of the neck by surrounding strings) and a 6th string for a 
low note. Inside chords, which include a bass note, produce a deeper, fuller 
sound, and are good for when there’s no bass player around.
Because we start our chord explorations at the 1st fret, we chose F to name 
our chords. But all the forms presented in this chapter are movable, so when 
you practice playing them at different frets, the letter name will change. For 
example, if you play the chords two frets higher than where we present them 
in the figures, you produce G chords of various qualities. Our purpose in 

511
 Chapter 4: Building Finger Independence with Chord Exercises
Book VI
Exercises: 
Practice, 
Practice, 
Practice
choosing F is that it’s an efficient way to present all the different forms. But 
we don’t favor F any more than G or B% or F#. (Okay, maybe we like F a little 
more than F#, but only because the key of F# has six sharps.)
 
As with practicing scales and arpeggios, play each chord exercise in this chapter 
slowly, loudly, and deliberately at first, making sure you can hear all the strings 
that are supposed to ring — and none of the strings that aren’t! Then play the 
exercise faster and with a lighter touch. Just be sure to maintain your starting 
tempo and dynamic level (loudness) throughout each exercise.
Patterns using outside chords
Figure 4-1 shows the neck diagram and the corresponding music and tab for 
the three forms of an outside-string F major chord. Remember that when 
you practice these exercises, the Xs in the chord diagrams mean that those 
strings aren’t played. So avoid striking or plucking them with your right hand.

In all the rhythm examples that follow for outside chords, strum each chord 
lightly in quarter notes (one strum per beat) and avoid playing the lowest 
two strings of the guitar.
Now try the rhythm exercise in Figure 4-2, which uses the outside forms of F, 
played two to a bar, or two beats on each chord.

When going from the first form to the second, keep your third finger on 
the string as you slide up the neck. That way, you only have to reposition 
two other fingers (rather than all three). Apply the same “common finger” 
approach between the fourth and fifth chords in the exercise.
Figure 4-3 shows the neck diagram for the three forms of an outside-string F 
minor chord along with the corresponding music and tab. Practice this 
pattern as many times as you need to in order to play it smoothly — 
especially form 3, where you have to squeeze your fingers together a bit.
The exercise in Figure 4-4 uses the four outside forms of F minor, played two 
to a bar, or two beats on each chord. The common finger approach that you 
use in the previous exercise works like a charm here: The third finger plays 
the same string in all three chord forms. So keep it anchored on the 4th string 
as you move your hand up and down the neck.
To see the neck diagram for the four forms of an outside F7 chord, along with 
the corresponding music and tab, check out Figure 4-5. Practice the pattern 
here until you can move comfortably between the forms with no interruption 
in the rhythm.

Figure 4-8 shows an exercise using the four outside forms of Fm7, played 
two to a bar, or two beats on each chord. Outside minor 7th chords are quite 
common in the jazz guitar style known as chord melody, so work for a smooth, 
even, and mellow sound as you play these chords. Imagine yourself jamming 
alongside a stand-up bass and a drummer using brushes.

As practice, try the exercise in Figure 4-10, which uses the four outside forms 
of Fmaj7, played two to a bar, or two beats on each chord. Form 3 is probably 
the trickiest chord in this series because it requires you to stretch your fingers 
out over all four frets in the position, and you have a wide space between the 
second and third fingers. Practice grabbing this chord in isolation (by removing 
your hand from the chord and replaying it several times) before playing the 
whole exercise up to tempo.

In Figure 4-11, you see the neck diagram for the four forms of an outside F#m7%5 
chord along with the corresponding music and tab. Practice this pattern slowly 
at first and as many times as you need to until you have it memorized. Then, 
when you get “off book,” work on playing it faster.
Now try your hand at the exercise in Figure 4-12, which uses the four outside 
forms of F#m7%5, played two to a bar, or two beats on each chord. Except for 
the first and last chords, every chord in this exercise is played with a barre. 
Be sure to check your barre notes (by playing the individual strings one at a 
time, slowly) to make sure they’re all ringing out clearly and with no buzzing.
To see the neck diagram and corresponding music and tab for the three 
forms of an outside-string F#”7 chord, check out Figure 4-13. Songs using the 
diminished 7th chord sometimes have you playing several forms in quick 
succession, so make sure you can play this at a fairly fast tempo.

When you’re ready to finish off your outside chord practice, take a look at 
Figure 4-14, which shows an exercise in rhythm using the four outside forms 
of F#”7, played two to a bar, or two beats on each chord. The diminished chord 
form has the same fingering for all of its inversions. So you get a free pass here 
and have to learn only one form, which you can slide up and down the neck 
with abandon. Because your fingers don’t have to switch strings, try playing 
this example at a brighter tempo than you normally would.

Patterns using inside chords
Figure 4-15 shows the neck diagram and corresponding music and tab for the 
three forms of an inside F major chord. Remember that the Xs in the chord 
diagrams indicate that those strings aren’t played. Practice this pattern as 
many times as you need to in order to get it to flow smoothly and so there’s 
no trace of that 5th string ringing through.
 
In the case of inside chords, it’s difficult not to strike the 5th string when 
strumming (either with the backs of the fingernails or with a pick). So you 
should mute, or deaden, the string by allowing a left-hand finger to lightly 
touch it, which will prevent it from ringing out. This muting action is usually 
done by the finger that’s fretting the 6th string. For the 1st string, simply 
relaxing the left hand so the underside of the fingers touch the string lightly 
is enough to prevent it from ringing out.
You can practice this muting technique in the exercise in Figure 4-16, which 
uses the three inside forms of F, played two to a bar, or two beats on each 
chord. Strum each chord lightly in quarter notes (one strum per beat), and 
avoid or mute the 5th and 1st strings of the guitar (indicated with Xs in the 
chord diagrams).

Figure 4-17 shows the neck diagram and corresponding standard notation 
and tab for the three forms of an inside F minor chord. You can practice this 
pattern by keeping the third and first fingers in the same basic shape as you

When you’re ready, try Figure 4-18’s exercise in rhythm, which uses the three 
inside forms of F minor, played two to a bar, or two beats on each chord. You 
may have trouble muting the 5th string (which isn’t supposed to sound) on 
form 1. So for this exercise, try plucking the strings with your right-hand 
fingers rather than strumming them with a pick.

Now take a look at the neck diagram and corresponding music and tab for 
the four forms of an inside F7 chord, shown in Figure 4-19. Make sure that 
you can blend all the notes together with your right-hand attack and that no 
one note stands out above the rest. Practice this pattern so you can change

Give the exercise in Figure 4-20 a try. It uses the four inside forms of F7, played 
two to a bar, or two beats on each chord. Some guitarists, especially jazz players, 
like to use an alternate fingering for form 1. Try playing this chord with your 
first finger (not barred) on the 6th string, your second finger on the 4th string, 
your fourth finger on the 3rd string, and your third finger on the 2nd string. 
If you prefer this fingering to the barred version, you may be a jazzbo!

Figure 4-22 shows an exercise using the four inside forms of Fm7, played two to 
a bar, or two beats on each chord. Most experienced guitarists (jazz and rock 
players alike) play form 1 with the second finger on the 6th string and the third 
finger (barred) across the 4th, 3rd, and 2nd strings, described in the previous 
paragraph. Playing the chord this way helps you to better keep the 5th string 
from sounding. Try form 1 the two-finger way, and if it seems awkward at the 
1st fret, move it up to the middle of the neck where it will be more comfortable.

To see the neck diagram and corresponding music and tab for the four forms 
of an inside Fmaj7 chord, check out Figure 4-23. Practice form 2 first in isolation 
because it has a stretch between the second and first fingers. Then try the 
exercise in its entirety.
Figure 4-24 is an exercise using the four inside forms of Fmaj7, played two to 
a bar, or two beats on each chord. Between forms 3 and 4 you have an oppor-
tunity to make the chord change even smoother by leaving your third finger 
on the 6th string as you move up and down the neck. Just be sure to relax the 
third finger so it doesn’t make a sliding sound on the string as you change 
positions.

As practice, try the exercise in Figure 4-26, which uses the four inside forms
 of F#m7%5, played two to a bar, or two beats on each chord. A very cool 
“common finger” chord change occurs between forms 2 and 3. Both the second 
and first fingers stay on the same strings as they move to the new form. But the 
first finger goes from playing a single note on the fingertip to playing a barre 
on the flat part. So be sure to flatten out your first finger slightly as you move. 
To become familiar with this efficient finger movement, try isolating these two 
chords (that is, practice changing between the two forms a number of times 
before playing the whole exercise).

To practice, you can try the exercise in Figure 4-28, which uses the four inside 
forms of F#”7, played two to a bar, or two beats on each chord. Just as in the

As if having the same forms didn’t make things easy enough, we have another 
tip for you. Try the alternate, three-finger version of the chord: Barre the 4th 
and 2nd strings with your first finger. Then play the 6th string note with your 
second finger and the 3rd string note with your third finger. Many guitarists 
find this fingering faster to grab than the one presented (especially after they 
become better at playing barre chords). Try both versions and decide for 
yourself, however.
Playing Chord Progressions
 
Playing chords by themselves or organized by string assignment is a good 
way to get your fingers in shape. But in actual musical situations, you play 
chords according to another organizing principle: a chord progression. A chord 
progression is merely a series of chords that go together in a musically logical 
fashion — to support a melody or as the framework for a jam or improvisation 
(such as the 12-bar blues).
The chord progressions in the following sections may sound like real and 
familiar songs, and they should. That’s because many songs have used the 
following progressions either in whole or in part.

530
Book VI: Exercises: Practice, Practice, Practice 
Progressions using outside chords
Outside chord forms use the top four strings of the guitar (which are the 
highest pitched), and they’re good for rhythm parts when you have a bass 
player in your midst (or when you’re joined by a pianist who’s playing low 
notes in the left hand). Outside chord forms are also nice when you want the 
brighter sound of the higher strings to cut through — the way a mandolin 
sounds when it plays rhythm.
Figures 4-29 and 4-30 show two chord progressions, each of which uses nine 
different outside forms, played two to a bar. Play the chord progressions 
both legato (letting the strings ring out as long as possible) and staccato 
(where the strings are muted by the release of your fretting fingers) to create 
two different moods.

Progressions using inside chords
In this book, inside chords feature the 6th string as part of the chord, separated 
widely from the next highest note because of the skip of the 5th string. The 
presence of the low note in inside chords means that the inside chords pro-
vide a nice bottom, or bass part, which is good for solo guitarists, guitarists 
playing with other instruments but without a bass player, or accompanists 
backing up a singer.
Take a look at Figures 4-31 and 4-32, which show two chord progressions, each 
using nine different inside forms, played two to a bar. To help get the 6th string 
note to ring a little more clearly, try separating it from the rest of the chord 
by plucking it a little harder than the rest of the strings, or by playing the bass 
note with your right-hand thumb and the rest of the chord with your index, 
middle, and ring fingers. For extra practice, try playing just the bass note on 
beats 1 and 3 and just the upper three strings of the chord on beats 2 and 4.

Practicing Pieces that 
Use Chord Progressions
Seventh chords are great for playing jazz and jazzy types of arrangements, so 
we selected two songs to jazzify in the following sections: One is a traditional 
folk ballad, and the other is a standard by Jerome Kern. The first song has 
you working with outside chords, and the second one gives you an inside 
look at inside chords.
Putting outside chords to 
use with “Danny Boy”
The lovely Irish ballad “Danny Boy” is actually based on an old traditional 
melody called “Londonderry Air.” And if you’ve ever checked out the derrières in 
London, you can see why they changed the title. [Rim shot.] But seriously. The 
lyrics were added later, as a poignant message from a father to his absent son.
Play “Danny Boy” (shown in Figure 4-33) slowly and gently, and try to make 
the one-beat chord changes (which occur in bars 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16) 
sound smooth and unrushed. Don’t worry if you can’t play the F chord in bar 
14 cleanly at first; it takes some effort to cram three fingers onto the 2nd, 3rd, 
and 4th strings at the 10th fret.

You can try this alternate fingering if you’re having trouble: Use your third 
finger to barre the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th strings at the 10th fret, lifting it just 
enough to allow the 1st string (fretted by the first finger) to ring. It’s tricky, 
but you may find it easier than using four separate fingers for this form so 
high on the neck.
Playing inside chords in “Look 
for the Silver Lining”
Jerome Kern wrote “Look for the Silver Lining” for an all-but-forgotten musical 
called Sally, but most people who know this call to optimism are familiar with 
the versions sung by Judy Garland or jazz trumpet great Chet Baker.
Play this song (shown in Figure 4-34) moderately slowly, and try to let the 
chords that last only one beat (such as the Am7 and D7 chords in bar 1) 
sound as legato as the chords that receive two beats.
 
The trick to this piece is making quick and efficient motions between chord 
changes without affecting the ring-out of the chord strum itself. You need 
to change chords quickly, but you must also allow the chords to sound for 
their full duration.

Writing Songs 
and Music

In this book . . .
W
e help you gratify your urge to share your musical 
vision with the world. Lots of great songs have 
been written on the guitar because it’s such a great 
accompaniment for voice. Writing music and songs may 
sound easy, but once you try, you may find that it’s not. 
Luckily, others who have gone before you have come back 
with lots of hard-earned advice on ways of doing it with 
increased success. This book can be your ticket to 
unleashing your creativity while pointing out typical 
beginner errors, saving you time and grief and giving you 
a leg up on others.
Here are the contents of Book VII at a glance.

Chapter 1
Everything You Need 
to Write a Song
In This Chapter
 Looking at what motivates people to write songs
 Examining the role of music in your life
 Finding out what it takes to write a song
 Taking your first six steps in songwriting
S
ongs — the combination of music and words (or lyrics) — have the 
power to make people laugh, cry, or even scream out in protest. They 
cause people to pound on their steering wheels as they’re driving down the 
road — buttoned-down businesspeople are transformed into their favorite 
rockers during morning commutes. And thousands become pop divas in the 
privacy of their own showers. Songs can transport you to a moment 30 years 
in the past, and some of the songs you enjoy today will stay with you for 
years to come.
Given the way songs can move and inspire people, you’re not alone if you’re 
interested in writing a few songs of your own after playing a lot of guitar. 
Maybe you’ve even come up with some lyrics, or thought of a melody, but 
you’re just not sure where to take it from there. In this chapter, you become 
familiar with all the facets of songwriting that you need to be aware of. 
Whether you’re just starting out or you already have a few songs (or por-
tions of songs) under your belt, you’re at this book’s beginning, and as Julie 
Andrews sang, that’s “a very good place to start.”

Book VII: Writing Songs and Music 
Understanding Why People Write Songs
People write songs for many reasons: to express their feelings, spark debate, 
inform their audience, push others to act. . . . There are probably as many 
reasons for writing songs as there are people who write them. Songs are 
often written by people who have a hard time verbalizing what’s in their 
hearts — sometimes, pairing their feelings with music helps people say what 
they really feel. Others may write songs because they have a message to 
get across — a message that much of the world may not be quite ready to 
hear — and putting that message to music can help penetrate even the most 
shielded of ears.
You may want to write a song to
 
 Express your true self.
 
 Release the music inside of you that’s just waiting to get out.
 
 Give back to your songwriting heroes some of the joy and inspiration 
they’ve given you.
 
 Develop the gift of expression you may have been born with.
 
 Gain acceptance and make new friends.
 
 Earn a living at something you truly love!
 
Whatever your motive, the goal is the same:
 
 To come up with words and music from the inner reaches of your 
imagination
 
 To connect with others through a song
 
 To create something of lasting value
Finding the Songwriter in You
Fortunately, the main requirements for writing a song are exactly the same, 
whether it’s strictly for yourself and for your loved ones or for the music-
buying public. The main ingredients are a passion for music, a need to express 
yourself in song, a mind receptive to the ideas that come floating your way, 
and a willingness to find and network with other talented individuals who can 
help you realize your musical vision. Ironically, many songwriters say that 
some of their biggest hits were never intended for mass exposure or written 

541
 Chapter 1: Everything You Need to Write a Song
Book VII
Writing

Music
with success in mind. They were a personal expression of something in their 
hearts as a gift to themselves or for family, friends, and loved ones.
This chapter is for everyone who shares the dream of harnessing the song-
writing power we all have within. You’ve come to the right place if your heart 
keeps tugging at you to write a song — but you’re uncertain as to the process 
of the craft or what’s required to create a really good one. If you know the 
elements that make up a great song and how the pros go about writing one, 
you can get on the right path to creating one of your own. Writing a song 
isn’t rocket science, no matter what the music theory books would have you 
believe. Not that a little book learning isn’t a great thing; it’s just that compli-
cated notions can stop you before you get started.
Songwriting is about 80 percent inspiration, 10 percent perspiration, and 
10 percent implementation. So let’s not get it backwards. Hopefully we can 
take down some of the roadblocks to writing a song and get to the heart of 
the matter — because that’s where a song is born.
Being aware of your personal 
connection to songs
If you are compelled to be a songwriter, you’ve probably gotten a great deal 
of enjoyment from listening to songs over the years. When you think back 
on your life (whether you’ve lived 18 years or 80), how many songs come to 
mind when you think of important moments? Do certain songs bring to mind 
sights, sounds, smells, and emotions from the places you were when you first 
heard them? Have certain songs become your favorites because they express 
exactly what you hadn’t been able to put into words yourself?
If you can easily compile a soundtrack to your life, full of all the songs you’ve 
loved over the years, you’re off to a good start. If you would have trouble fit-
ting that soundtrack onto one tape or CD, that’s even better! Why? Because if 
your life has been greatly affected by the power of music, you’re in the right 
position to affect others through the songs you write.
Taking a look at your instincts
If you feel a deep connection with certain special songs throughout your 
life, you can be pretty sure that you have the emotional capacity to express 
yourself in the context of a song. Besides having that appreciation for other 

542
Book VII: Writing Songs and Music 
people’s songs, check out the following list to roughly determine your S.Q. 
(yeah, you guessed it, your “song quotient”).
You just may be a songwriter if:
 
 You’ve ever sung a melody in your shower and started gyrating wildly 
when you realized it was a song that didn’t yet exist.
 
 You often find yourself lost in the industrial section of an unfamiliar 
town when you realize that the great lyric ideas you’ve been jotting 
down have totally obscured that little road map your friend had scrib-
bled down for you to get to her house.
 
 You create a gaper’s block in the freezer section of the supermarket 
when you take your microcassette recorder, iPhone, or digital voice 
recorder out of your bag and start chanting the hook of the new rap 
song you’ve created that documents the multiplicity of brands of frozen 
vegetables.
 
 You create a new angry lyric and shouted melody over the chord 
changes of “Muskrat Love” while performing karaoke at the local club.
 
 You visit friends and rudely spend most of the time in their 8-year-old 
son’s bedroom, strumming some new chord changes on his toy guitar.
 
 You start haunting every club for musicians to put your latest poem to 
music.
 
 On the street, you stop everyone in a black turtleneck sweater to see if 
they’re a poet who could supply words for your music.
 
 Your hands are rubbed raw from pounding out rhythms on your desk-
top, laptop, dashboard, dog, or garbage can.
If you can identify any aspect of yourself in this inventory list, you may be on 
your way to writing a song. If you haven’t already done any of these things, 
don’t despair. You can still develop your instincts and try your hand at song-
writing. Who knows? You just may unlock a part of you that you never even 
knew existed.
Starting at the Beginning — 
Before You Write a Song
After you figure out why you want to write songs, and after you discover that 
you have what it takes to give it a shot, you’re ready to dive in. But writing a 
song can be an intimidating process. After all, where do you begin?

Writing 
Songs and 
Music
Is formal music training a must?
Music training isn’t a prerequisite for songwriting. However, if you don’t at 
least have some ability on the guitar or piano to help put the ideas in your 
head into some tangible form, you may be at a disadvantage. (Notice we 
said “may.” Funnyman Mel Brooks composed the musical score to his hit 
Broadway show The Producers by humming the melodies into a tape recorder 
and having someone translate that into musical notes on a page.) Musical 
ability, especially guitar playing, helps you with the rhythm of your words 
and the structure of your songs. All of this musical expertise is advantageous, 
but not required.
Jim Peterik, Grammy Award–winning 
songwriter, on songwriting
Most of what I know about songwriting, I learned 
by being a fan of music. Truly the best teacher 
is listening. I emulated the styles of songs that 
inspired me, and gradually, over the course of 
many years, integrated these influences into a 
style of my own. The Beatles’ songwriting, to 
cite a notable example, was heavily influenced 
by the American rock ’n’ roll of Chuck Berry, Carl 
Perkins, the Everly Brothers, and Little Richard. 
The Beatles created songs by absorbing those 
influences and adding their own unique per-
sonalities. The fact that they could barely read 
music hardly mattered. They had ears. Studying 
music theory, history, and arrangement can only 
enhance your abilities as a writer, but it would 
be a mistake to infer that formal training is a 
necessity to write a great song. Music appre-
ciation classes can open your eyes and ears to 
what you should be listening for in songs, but 
you really don’t need anyone to tell your foot 
when to start tapping or your lips to break out 
into a big smile when the chorus hits — that’s 
just the power of great music. Start with your 
love for the songs you hear and then tap into all 
you have to express in your soul.
If you’re still not convinced that you don’t need 
training, consider the fact that some of the 
greatest songs ever written were composed 
by people with virtually no formal music train-
ing. Folk music, chants, Delta blues, country, 
and rock ’n’ roll all got their start with people 
who had the raw talent to create songs. On the 
other hand, many legendary composers have 
extensive musical training in all forms of music, 
including classical composition. Just don’t let 
the so-called “rules” hold you back or keep you 
frozen.
In college, my harmony teacher told me at the 
end of the semester, “You know all that stuff I 
taught you about avoiding parallel 5ths? Forget 
about it! If it sounds good, just do it!” By the 
way, that was the only formal music training I 
ever got, other than two years of piano and a 
few years of saxophone lessons. I earned a C+ 
in that class. It’s my belief that life is the best 
teacher, and listening to and enjoying a good 
song are perhaps the best ways to learn to 
write songs yourself.

544
Book VII: Writing Songs and Music 
Although songwriting is more than just an assembly line of components to be 
bolted together, it doesn’t hurt to know what’s available in the “parts bin.” 
A song is made up of chords (a combination of two or more tones sounded 
together in harmony), melody (the arrangement of single tones in sequence — 
the part you sing), rhythm (the beat or pulse of the song), and words (often 
called lyrics in the context of a song). Many successful songwriters excel in 
one area or another. Rare individuals can do it all. Even the ones who are a 
songwriting “one stop” often choose to collaborate with others to create that 
magical song that comes from a blend of styles and personalities. It’s your 
task at hand, if you are challenged in a given area, to find writers to complete 
your vision and supply the expertise you lack.
 
Although some songwriters do well with the trial-and-error method, the more 
you know about music, the better your chances are to write a great song. The 
more adept you can become at an instrument, the easier it will be to create 
and demonstrate the ideas in your head. You don’t need to enroll in a college 
course to study music. Instructions in music theory, composition, instrument 
performance, and voice are available at a per-session rate. Qualified, reason-
ably priced private teachers can be located through your local music shop 
or in the back pages of the local “freebie” entertainment newspaper. Finding 
someone who inspires you will make songwriting a lot easier.
Being prepared when inspiration strikes
Ideas will come into your brain while you’re in the strangest of places, at any 
time of the day or night. You’ve probably heard stories about how some of 
the greatest hits were born. Paul McCartney has said some of his best songs 
came to him in his dreams. Billy Joel got the song “River of Dreams” from — 
you guessed it — a dream. And Sting, former lead singer of the group The 
Police, awakened in the middle of the night, wrote a song in ten minutes, and 
went back to sleep. The song? “Every Breath You Take.” (Makes you want to 
get plenty of shut-eye, doesn’t it?)
 
When a melody or a lyrical idea pops into your head, make sure you have a 
way of freezing it in time. Try to carry with you, at all times, a notebook to jot 
down ideas and a recording device to capture your musical phrases. Never 
fool yourself into thinking you’ll remember the ideas when you get home. 
And don’t think that “If it’s really so great of an idea, I won’t forget it.” Some 
great songs will never be heard because the songwriter couldn’t reconstruct 
some once-in-a-lifetime moment of inspiration.
 
A flash of inspiration may hit you when you least expect it. Be ready to catch 
it — then be prepared to work hard at turning the initial idea into a finished 
song.

545
 Chapter 1: Everything You Need to Write a Song
Book VII
Writing 
Songs and 
Music
Finding inspiration within yourself
So you aren’t being awakened in the middle of the night by divine inspiration? 
Not to worry. You can find inspiration even if it doesn’t seem to find you. The 
unique way you look at the world and feel about things, the mood you project 
in life, and all of your emotions are unmistakably projected in your song. In 
other words, write about what you know and feel, and you’re sure to come up 
with something unique (because even though you thought your mother was 
lame when she said it, there’s only one you).
Some writers, through their melodies, chord progressions, and lyrics, project 
a powerful optimism. Others project wonder, a bittersweet sadness, or pure 
anger. But few songwriters can project all emotions within a single song or 
even on one CD — so don’t pressure yourself to cram in every possible emo-
tion all at once.
 
Whatever the mood, all great songs have the ability to move people, to make 
them feel something.
Psychologists say that songs can put us in touch with our feelings. We all 
know what it feels like to be happy, sad, afraid, or in love. Often, a song is 
what puts us in touch with emotions.
 
Expressing your authentic feelings in a song is not only therapeutic to you 
as a person, but it can also be the clay from which a lasting song can be 
sculpted. If your audience can see a little bit of themselves in your song, if 
they can identify directly with what you’re saying, your song just may stay 
in their hearts and minds (and MP3 players) long after it has dropped off 
the Billboard charts. When you feel passionate about an issue, when you are 
swept away by some new fad or idea, whether you are moved to tears by a 
movie or the passing of a loved one, or when you’ve recently fallen in or out 
of love — these are the subjects and feelings that will resonate in your song. 
Your own experience is perhaps more universal than you think.
Capturing that loving feeling
In a survey based on performances, sheet 
music, and record sales, Variety, the entertain-
ment trade paper, once named the 100 most 
popular songs of all time. An analysis of the 
themes of those 100 titles showed that about 
85 percent of them were love songs. Many of 
those blockbuster golden oldies are still gener-
ating new recordings after 50 years.

546
Book VII: Writing Songs and Music 
Creating the mood
It all starts with you — who you are and what feeling or mood you’re able to 
project. The number of people who will be able to connect with and relate to 
the mood you’re creating will determine just how successful your song will be.
In some great songs, the mood of the music matches perfectly to the lyric. 
For example:
 
 Minor chords often become the basis for sadder, deeper, and more intro-
spective songs. Listen to “New York State of Mind” (written and sung by 
Billy Joel), “New York Minute” (written by Don Henley, Daniel Kortchmar, 
and Jai Winding; sung by Don Henley), or “Paint It Black” (written by Mick 
Jagger and Keith Richards; performed by the Rolling Stones).
 
 Major chords generally result in happier and more optimistic songs like 
“You Are the Sunshine of My Life” (written and sung by Stevie Wonder) or 
Survivor’s “High on You” (written by Jim Peterik and Frankie Sullivan).
In other songs, the mood of the lyric is in direct contrast to the vibe of the 
music, such as in Elton John’s deceptively happy ditty “I Think I’m Going to 
Words of wisdom from Johnny Van Zant, 
lead singer of Lynyrd Skynyrd
Whatever moves me to write a song is usually a 
pretty good reason. I can really only write about 
what I feel in my heart. On September 11, 2001, 
I received a call from a good friend of mine who 
works on the rooftops in Manhattan. He had just 
been witness to one of the great tragedies of 
our or any time, as he heard a huge explosion 
and watched helplessly as the first of two jet 
aircrafts crashed into the World Trade Center. 
He called me and said that when he looked 
around, all of his co-workers had tears stream-
ing down their faces. I said to him, “This has got 
to be the day America cried.”
As I watched the images of destruction all that 
day, I started to sing a melody that seemed to 
mirror my emotions at the time. The next day I 
called up my good buddy Jim Peterik and told 
him that there was a song to be written here 
that could possibly do some good. I sang him a 
piece of the melody I had in my head. The first 
words out of Jim’s mouth were, “In the shadow 
of the Statue of Liberty” to which I added, “In 
the torchlight of the land of the free.” From 
there, with the help of Ma Bell, digital record-
ing, and the grace of God, a song was born.
We are proud to say that the fruits from our labor 
of love became the title song to The Day America 
Cried album, helped raised some money, and 
hopefully expressed a few emotions locked in 
so many hearts. That’s the power of a song.

Kill Myself” (written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin) and “I’ll Never Fall 
In Love Again” (written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David; sung by Dionne 
Warwick). That bittersweet contrast between the words and the music is 
often what gives a song its potency.
 
The greatest intimacy you share with your audience as a songwriter (and 
your greatest responsibility) is the transference of the mood you have cre-
ated in a song. Taking that idea a bit further, you’re also sharing with your 
audience the mood you happened to be in as you were creating the song. It’s 
a thought-provoking notion that when you respond emotionally to one of the 
great classics, you’re actually feeling a little bit of what the composer was 
feeling at the moment of creation, even if it was many years ago. Such is the 
transcendent, timeless nature of songwriting.
Six Steps to Writing Your First Song
 
You have your notebook at your side, a gross of freshly sharpened pencils, 
your recorder in your bag, and you’re just waiting for the next drip of inspira-
tion to hit you on the head. First off, don’t expect miracles right off the bat. 
Your first ideas may not be ready for prime time. But there’s really no such 
thing as a bad idea, only ones that need to be refined, clarified, or made more 
unique and clever — and real. You’ve got to start somewhere. Try to find 
some time each day to write. Before long, those moments you set aside will 
become an oasis in the often dry climate of a typical day. The more you prac-
tice your craft, the better your odds of coming up with that one special song 
that the world wants to hear.
Songwriting takes an enormous amount of patience and hard work. Fortunately, 
there’s a lot of fun to be had along the way. In that spirit, here are the six steps to 
writing your first song:
 
1. Find a message you feel passionate about. Choose a cause that reso-
nates with you. Write about the girl you’ve been too insecure to ask out 
or that guy who you wish would take notice of you. Write about what 
interests you. Write about what you know. Keep it simple. If a subject is 
vital to you, it just might be vital to others as well. Similarly, if you don’t 
care about a subject, don’t expect others to either.
 
2. Find a simple melody. So many new songwriters get in over their 
heads trying to be complex to win friends and influence publishers. 
Songwriters are not paid by the note — you’re rewarded by the connec-
tions you make in the synapses of your audiences’ brains. Often the easi-
est melodies are the longest lasting.

548
Book VII: Writing Songs and Music 
 
3. Find a simple set of chord changes. Search your guitar or a piano key-
board for this needed element of your song, or search the Internet or 
local clubs for the musicians who can furnish your words and melodies 
with a comfortable music bed. (Chapter 1 in Book II gets you started 
playing chords.)
 
4. Find a place to write. Find a quiet, pastoral setting to clear your mind, 
light some incense, and let the melodies and emotions flow. If this isn’t 
possible, any chaotic subway station will do. Other key areas to write: 
supermarkets, flea markets, soccer matches, PTA meetings, in the car, 
and anywhere else where the distractions merge to zero.
 
5. Be inspired by your guitar or other instrument. Pick up any old instru-
ment that’s lying around the house and see if you can coax some sound 
out of it. It’s really all about what you’re hearing in your head. If you can 
imagine what the finished song will sound like, you can write it on your 
late Uncle Louie’s banjo.
 
6. Find the confidence within yourself to put your heart and soul on the 
line and share your song with others. It’s through this loop of constant 
feedback that you discover how to improve your songs. Resist the urge 
to discount everything but positive reaction. Resist the urge to devalue 
the positive reactions. Breathe in the accolades and weigh the brickbats. 
Take it all in, but before making any changes, always check it against 
your heart for the truth.

W
hen the average listener hears a new song on the radio, she probably 
doesn’t turn to her friend and say, “Wow, awesome pre-chorus — I 
love how it sets up the hook!” Nonetheless, every song is built upon a struc-
ture. The framework can follow any of several tried-and-true patterns, or it 
can break the mold and go where no song has gone before.
Knowing basic song forms (or formats) helps guide you as you’re constructing 
a song. It also helps identify what you’re doing instinctively. It’s important to 
understand the basics of song structure even if you choose to stray from it in 
certain instances. There is, however, something reassuring to the ear about 
the use of familiar song organization that can help a songwriter sound imme-
diately more professional and commercial.
In this chapter you take a look at many of the most commonly used and suc-
cessful song forms. You see how a song is broken down to its basic modular 
components and how the various sections can be organized to create a syn-
ergy that is greater than the sum of its parts.

550
Book VII: Writing Songs and Music 
Talking the Talk
 
Before you look at song forms, it’s important to understand the terminology 
songwriters use when they’re talking shop. Here are the main terms for the 
various sections of a song:
 
 Intro: This section, which starts out the song, is typically an abbreviated 
instrumental form of the chorus or sometimes the verse. Its purpose is 
to get the ear ready and introduce all that is to come. Listen to any radio 
station. The majority of the songs you hear will have some form of intro, 
and your “tune-out factor” will be directly affected by how effective the 
writers and arrangers are at catching your attention right off the bat.
 
 Verse: The purpose of the verse is to reveal the storyline of the tune. It 
helps propel the listener to the chorus while conveying the song’s basic 
mood and message. The words, or lyrics, of the verse, tend to expand 
from verse to verse with new information added to move the story 
along. The melody and chord pattern of the verse is usually the same 
from verse to verse, except for minor variations in melody usually to 
make a lyric fit.
 
 Pre-chorus: This section, also known as the “B” section and the set-up, 
among other nicknames, is the optional section preceding the chorus 
that provides a little fresh terrain both lyrically and chordally before 
pressing on to the chorus. It’s usually no more than eight bars in length 
and sometimes contains the identical lyric each time it comes around. 
The decision to use a pre-chorus is strictly on a “need-to-use” basis. If 
a song is propelled sufficiently to the chorus without it, then you don’t 
really need the extra baggage.
 
 Chorus: The chorus is the “money section” of a song — which is to say 
that if you’ve done your job well, this is the part that people will go 
around singing as they plunk down their hard-earned money to own 
a copy for themselves. This section usually contains the title or hook 
of the song either at the beginning or end of the chorus. The chorus 
features a signature phrase or musical figure that’s repeated through-
out the song and serves as the main identifying portion of the song. 
Musically and lyrically, choruses tend to be identical except for minor 
variations. (One exception to this generality is the song, often a country 
song, that saves the surprise lyrical payoff for the last chorus and is 
therefore very different.) In most cases, songwriters like to keep their 
choruses identical so it’s harder for the audience to muff a line in the big 
sing-along.
 
 Bridge: The bridge, sometimes called the release, channel, special, or 
middle 8 (referring to the eight musical measures that the bridge tends 
to occupy), comes after the second chorus in the majority of pop songs. 

551
 Chapter 2: Whipping Your Song into Shape: Song Forms
Book VII
Writing 
Songs and 
Music
It’s not a necessity in all songs. It can either contain lyrics or be instru-
mental in nature. Whether the bridge contains words or not, its main 
function is to give the ear some fresh real estate to land on.
 
 Coda: A special ending section, also called an outro or a tag, that can be 
added to the end of a song. It’s typically a kind of grand finale.
Now that you see the various components that make up a song, take a look at 
the various ways of organizing them in the following sections. Again, there’s 
no right or wrong way, only what sounds right or wrong to the ear. The sec-
tions of the song are each designated by a letter, the first melodic section 
you hear (generally the verse) is “A.” The second melodic section you hear 
is designated “B,” and the third section is called “C.” The fourth section (usu-
ally the bridge) is then called “D.” If you repeat a melodic section, even if the 
words are different, it’s still assigned the same letter.
Dealing with Verses
The basic fundamental section for any song is the verse. Some songs consist 
of nothing but verses.
The verse form: AAA
The verse form is often referred to as the AAA form. This is when different 
lyrics are placed over the same music and are repeated in close succession. 
Because the chorus and bridge are often eliminated in this form, the title will 
often appear in the first or last line of the verse. This form is often used when 
a story is being told, using each verse to propel the action forward. Church 
hymns usually fall into the AAA category, as do many folk songs. Many of the 
songs of Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez, and Judy Collins use the AAA form as well.
 
It’s especially important for your melody to be interesting in this form so it 
can withstand the repetition of identical sections. Often a musical section 
can come between verse sections to add interest. Sometimes a writer can 
throw in a sort of faux chorus (that’s a section that is chorus-like, but doesn’t 
contain the title hook of the song). Songs like this are generally considered a 
variation of the AAA in form.
The number of verses in a song written in the AAA form varies widely. Jimmy 
Webb’s song “By the Time I Get to Phoenix” (Glen Campbell’s breakthrough 
hit) only takes three verses to tell the story. There are three well-crafted 
verses, and each presents a location that the singer is thinking about as he 

552
Book VII: Writing Songs and Music 
embarks upon his journey away from his former girlfriend in California. The 
song is about what she’ll be doing when the singer arrives at each of three 
destinations: Phoenix, Albuquerque, and Oklahoma.
The title of the song is only mentioned once, in the first line of the first verse. 
That’s because each verse describes a different location, which Webb has 
cleverly shown in his first lines. Webb also has a clever use of lyric elsewhere 
in the song — for example, “She’ll just hear that phone keep on ringin’ off the 
wall” is followed by a simple “That’s all.” True to the verse form, the song 
tells a story that progresses from verse to verse.
For another example, check out “All Along the Watchtower” by Bob Dylan 
and made famous by Jimi Hendrix. It consists of three verses and is a good 
example of the style of lyric writing that Bob Dylan introduced during the 
1960s. If you listen carefully to these well-crafted words, you’ll hear that 
there’s no hook in the song at all: The title, “All Along the Watchtower,” is 
introduced in one place only, as the first line of Verse 3. Notice, however, 
that it’s probably the best candidate in the song for a title. Dylan could have 
called the song “Two Riders Were Approaching” or “There Must Be Some 
Way Out of Here,” but neither of these phrases comes close to “All Along the 
Watchtower” as a great title. Look up some (or all) of the songs in Table 2-1 
for more help with this form.

The two-verse form: AA
In the classic songs that were written by American composers for film and 
Broadway, a type of form called the two-verse form, or AA form, arose and 

553
 Chapter 2: Whipping Your Song into Shape: Song Forms
Book VII
Writing 
Songs and 
Music
became very popular. This form was very common from the 1940s through 
the 1960s and is the form of choice for many standards. Because of its lack of 
chorus, it hasn’t been used much in the pop music of the 1970s and beyond, 
but songwriter Lionel Ritchie did use an extended two-verse form for his hit 
1980s song “Hello.”
This form consists of, as its name implies, only two verses, but in these two 
verses, a complete and tidy story is told. Each verse is traditionally 16 mea-
sures, or bars, long. The second verse is usually a musical repeat of the first, 
but in some songs the second verse resembles the first, beginning the same 
way, but wraps up differently musically.

songs to pick from in Table 2-2.

The AABA Form
The form known as AABA was the form of choice in the first half of the 20th 
century. It’s still used today in songwriting, but has fallen off in popularity. 
However, it’s good to know this form because you never know when it’ll be 
the perfect fit for the song you’re writing.

554
Book VII: Writing Songs and Music 
The basics of the AABA form
In the AABA form, the A sections are the verse sections, and the B section is 
a bridge. In other forms, B represents whatever section comes second in the 
song. The title is usually placed either in the first or the last line of each verse 
and is in the same place each time it comes around.
 
The bridge is a section that provides a contrast to the verse sections by using 
different chords, a different melody, and sometimes a shift in the focus in the 
lyrics. It provides an interlude between verses, which can be very effective if 
it’s done well.
In the classic AABA song, the A sections are usually eight bars in length and 
constitute the main melody of the song. Each of the three A sections has a 
different set of words, although the last verse section can be a repeat of the 
first, as is the case in the song “Monday, Monday” performed by The Mamas 
and The Papas (written by John Phillips). In fact, all three verses can be the 
same, as in John Lennon and Paul McCartney’s “Do You Want to Know a 
Secret?” But these are exceptions to the rule and you won’t find many songs 
that repeat verses like that. Songwriters usually compose three separate sets 
of lyrics for the verse sections of the AABA form.
The AABA form continues to be used today in many styles of music — coun-
try, gospel, Christian, pop, jazz, theatre, and film — but not as often as it 
once was. The form can be used to provide a very effective emotional satis-
faction: The first two verses establish the main melody of the song, and then 
when the bridge is sung, it provides a different feeling because of its contrast-
ing quality. Thus, the return to the last verse provides an emotionally satisfy-
ing return to what was presented before.
There are always exceptions to every rule — that’s what makes life (and 
songs) interesting. Some AABA songs don’t introduce the title in the first 
or last line of each verse. “The Christmas Song” (written by Mel Torme and 
Robert Wells) is an example of this. Everyone knows this song (“Chestnuts 
roasting on an open fire . . .”), but the title, “The Christmas Song,” doesn’t 
appear in the lyrics at all because the title describes what the song is about 
and it’s not a phrase that would sound good in the song itself.
 
Another example of a different placement for the title is George and Ira 
Gershwin’s famous song “I Got Rhythm.” The title appears at the beginning 
of the first verse, and then gets transformed in the next two verses. In the 
second verse it becomes “I got daisies,” and in the third verse, it’s “I got star-
light.” This is a great trick, the same one used by songwriter Jimmy Webb 
in “By the Time I Get to Phoenix.” Take note of it — you may want to do the 
same thing in a song of your own someday.

555

A real classic, “Over the Rainbow,” was sung by Judy Garland in the film The 
Wizard of Oz. This is a great example of an AABA song with an added section 
at the end called a coda. The verses have a flowing feeling to them with the 
expansive quality of the words (“Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly”). 
This is perfectly contrasted by the quick movement of words in the bridge 
(“Where troubles melt like lemon drops away above the chimney tops”). The 
bridge provides a perfect interlude between the second and third verses.

cover more about the form.

The extended AABA form: AABABA
Beginning in the 1960s, some songwriters began using an extended version 
of the AABA form, called the AABABA. This is merely the AABA form with an 
additional bridge and a final verse. This final verse may be a repeat of a previ-
ous verse or even just a part of one of the previous verses.
John Lennon and Paul McCartney’s song “Yesterday” uses an extended AABA 
form. The title appears as the first line in each verse except for Verse 2, where the 
word suddenly is used instead. The title also appears in the last line of each verse, 
and in the last line of the bridge, and the final verse is just a repeat of Verse 3.
This AABABA form is also used in other Beatles songs (written by John 
Lennon and Paul McCartney), including the following:
 
 “I’ll Follow the Sun”
 
 “I Want to Hold Your Hand”

556
Book VII: Writing Songs and Music 
 
 “Hey Jude”
 
 “Hard Day’s Night”
 
 “Long and Winding Road”
 
 “I Call Your Name”
 
Things get a little more complicated in a few of McCartney’s songs. “Michelle,” 
for example, has a form of AABABABA. The fourth verse is not sung but 
is instead played as an instrumental. The words in the second verse are 
repeated in the third and fifth verses, so all of these verses are the same. All 
three bridges have different words, however. This is a very unusual and inno-
vative formal structure. Because the formal structures in many of the songs 
written by McCartney and Lennon are very advanced, you can get a lot out of 
studying them. (Don’t you wish your studies in school were this much fun?)
The Verse-Chorus Form: ABAB
The verse-chorus form is the most common in today’s pop, rock, gospel, R&B, 
and country music. In the verse-chorus form, or ABAB form, verses alternate 
with a chorus section. The chorus is always the same except, perhaps, at the 
end, where you can extend it to make a really great ending for the song.
The story that the song unfolds is contained within the verses. When the 
chorus is sung, it usually proclaims the title as the hook. Pop or rock songs 
that work well usually start out right away with a line that people relate to; 
then the words of the verse pull the listeners in, get them hooked. But the 
power comes when the chorus is sung. A good chorus is something that lis-
teners really take notice of; and because it’s repeated over and over, if it’s a 
great chorus, the song will imprint itself in listeners’ minds.
The basic version
Here’s an example of a basic ABAB song: “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” 
by Elton John and Bernie Taupin has two verses that tell the story about 
a person who is tired of the high life and wants to return to his life on the 
farm. The chorus emphasizes his feelings, bidding farewell to the “yellow 
brick road” and stating that he’s going back to his former life on the farm. No 
matter how many verses there are in the song, the chorus will always apply 
because it describes the main topic of the song. Notice that it starts and ends 
with the title, which helps it stick in the listener’s mind as the song’s hook.

557
 Chapter 2: Whipping Your Song into Shape: Song Forms
Book VII
Writing 
Songs and 
Music
 
The best place to put a title in a verse-chorus song is in the first line of the 
chorus. Some songwriters place the title in both the first line and the last line 
(as in “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road”).
Another great verse-chorus song comes from Alicia Keys, the first artist to 
be released on legendary producer and Arista Records founder Clive Davis’s 
new label, J Records. Her song “Fallin’” is a great example of a very simple 
verse-chorus song elevated to high art by a smoldering vocal and a bril-
liant arrangement. Two chords make up the entire song — the basic blues 
progression that you’ve heard in the classic song “I Put a Spell on You” by 
Screamin’ Jay Hawkins (covered by The Animals in the ’60s — and note the 
Hawkins song does eventually resolve to a third chord, unlike Ms. Keys’s). 
The progression in “Fallin’” that toggles between E minor and B minor has 
never sounded more elegant. The structure is the verse-chorus form with a 
very simple chorus. The song gains its momentum through repetition and 
the swelling of strings and background vocals in the arrangement. The song 
begins with a gospel-drenched a cappella (group or solo singing without 
musical accompaniment) opening line: “I keep on falling in and out of love 
with you” and then continues with the verse supported by piano:
“Fallin’” written and sung by Alicia Keys
Verse 1 (A)
I keep on falling in and out with you
Sometimes I love ya, sometimes you make me blue
Sometimes I feel good, at times I feel used
Lovin’ you, darlin’, makes me so confused
Chorus (B)
I keep on falling in and out of love with you
I never loved someone the way that I love you
Verse 2 (A)
Oh I never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure
Cause me so much pain
Just when I think I’m takin’ more than would a fool
I start fallin’ back in love with you

I never loved someone the way that I love you

“Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” and “Fallin’” stick to the verse-chorus form 
exactly. Sometimes, however, a verse-chorus song will present two verses 
before the first chorus is sung. This form variation would be described as 
AABAB, and you can look up the lyrics to some (or all) of the songs listed in 
Table 2-4 to learn about two verses before the chorus. This approach is some-
times an effective way to get into the feel of the song before the chorus arrives.

The verse-chorus form with 
a pre-chorus: ABC
A pre-chorus — a short section that leads up to the chorus — is a great device 
that you can use when writing a verse-chorus song. The Beatles’ “Lucy in the 
Sky with Diamonds” is an excellent example of a song that uses a pre-chorus 
with great success. If you don’t know the song well, listen to it while reading 
the words so you can get a good idea of what the pre-chorus sounds like and 
what it accomplishes. You’ll notice that Lennon and McCartney create a pre-
chorus (each with different words) before the first two times that the chorus 
is sung, but not before the last time it’s sung.
Grammy Award winner Jim Peterik 
on your vehicle to success
My first number one song, “Vehicle,” performed 
by the Ides of March, is probably the simplest 
song I’ve ever written. The verse just kind of 
merges seamlessly with the chorus as opposed 
to being set up by a pre-chorus:
 
 Verse
 
 I’m the friendly stranger in the black sedan 
Won’t you hop inside my car 
I got picture, got candy, I’m a lovable man 
And I can take you to the nearest star
 
 Chorus
 
 I’m your vehicle, baby 
I’ll take you anywhere you wanna go 
I’m your vehicle, baby 
By now I’m sure you’ll know 
That I love you (love you), 
need you (need you) 
Want you, got to have you, child 
Great God in heaven you know I love you

I have to write another one like that! As a song-
writer, I tend to devalue the simple songs I write, 
but those seem to always be the ones that turn 
out to be the biggest hits. In this example, every 
section has a hook, climaxing with “Great God 
in heaven you know I love you.” It took me years 
to figure out what I was doing right in my more 
successful songs, but it usually boils down to 
simplicity, relatability, and a great beat.

560
Book VII: Writing Songs and Music 
 
Think of the pre-chorus as a mini bridge, because like the actual bridge of 
a song, it’s taking your listeners’ ears and minds into some new territory. It 
also allows the lyricist to build the story before hitting the chorus.
The next time you’re writing a song, ask yourself whether your chorus would 
have more impact if it were set up by a pre-chorus. Often a good pre-chorus 
will have some fresh chord changes that haven’t been used in the verse, 
especially if the chorus is in the same key as the verse.
Songwriter Chad Kroeger and the band Nickleback created a very powerful 
hit song, using the verse-chorus with pre-chorus. What’s innovative about 
the song “How You Remind Me” is the placement of the title in the pre-chorus 
instead of the chorus. The pre-chorus leads to a powerful sing-along chorus 
that’s very effective.
In the second verse, the singer tells how he has failed in the past. The pre-
chorus is restated with the title and thesis of the song, then the chorus.
The final verse is simply the first verse, but this time a completely stripped-
down version using only the vocal and electric guitar, using just the first two 
lines. The pre-chorus is then repeated, and it leads into a full-stride version of 
the final chorus accentuated by dramatic breaks from the entire band. In this 
song, the pre-chorus, like the chorus, uses the same words each time.
The verse-chorus form with 
a bridge: ABABC
The purpose of a bridge is to provide an interlude between other sections. 
Verse-chorus songs with bridges are very much a part of today’s world.
Vertical Horizon is one of those bands that took many years and multiple 
albums to become an overnight sensation. Released in 2000, “Everything 
You Want” became their big breakthrough. In a mere 4 minutes and 17 sec-
onds, it defined what modern rock would sound like — intelligent, concise, 
catchy, cryptic, and extremely well crafted. The song is basically written in a 
verse-chorus form with the writer using two verses before hitting the chorus. 
Starting with a telegraphic electric guitar figure and soon joined by acoustic 
guitar and bass, the very “in-your-face” vocal starts the verse and immedi-
ately pulls you in.
After the first two verses, the song hits the very catchy and repetitive chorus. 
This is really the part you remember most when you first hear the song. Next 
comes the third verse, which treads some of the same emotional ground

already covered but in a slightly different way. The chorus is now repeated. 
Following is the bridge — and it’s everything a bridge should be: It blazes 
new ground chordally and thematically, and it raises the stakes as the singer 
strains for higher notes. Finally, the song enters the fourth verse — the kind 
of nostalgic looking back that’s a perfect wrap-up for this song. Following this 
is a double chorus — the first a clone of the other two choruses. The repeat 
chorus changes into the first person, however. Weaving in and out of the 
song is a magical, moody guitar motif. It’s probably as important an element 
as anything else in the song.
If you like bridges and want to know them better, check out the songs in 
Table 2-6 and see how they were used to create some pretty big hits.

The verse-chorus form with a pre-chorus 
and a bridge: ABCABCD
This very popular song form, sometimes referred to as ABCABCD, pulls 
out all the stops to convince the listener a song means business. The form 
includes not only a pre-chorus before every chorus, but also a formal bridge 
at the center of the song, usually after the second chorus, before the out 
chorus (as the final chorus is sometimes called). The truly daring can further 
test the audiences’ attention span by adding a third verse after the bridge, 
before the out chorus.
 
This form expands your chances of getting your lyrical point across, gives 
you the opportunity to make additional musical statements, and challenges 
the programming directors at radio stations across the country with songs 
longer than their formats allow. When using this form, make sure that it 
doesn’t collapse under the weight of too many sections.

A prime example
“Hold on Loosely,” the top-ten hit by 38 Special (written by Jim Peterik, Don 
Barnes, and Jeff Carlisi), is an example of a song that just flat out works in 
this form, as validated by its continued airplay. Take a look at how the song 
builds as you sing along and you’ll see why it has become a staple at classic 
rock radio:

As you may have noticed, the last verse bypasses the pre-chorus and heads 
right to the final chorus. By this time in the song, the writers felt it was no 
longer necessary and more important to get to the main hook.
Some variations of the form
One of Jim’s favorite songs that he’s ever co-written is “I Can’t Hold Back,” a 
hit for his band, Survivor, in 1985. It starts with an intricately picked guitar 
intro figure, then hits the first verse, “There’s a story in my eyes . . .”, then 
into the pre-chorus, “I can feel you tremble when we touch . . .”, and into the 
chorus, “I can’t hold back — I’m on the edge . . .”. From there it goes unex-
pectedly into an instrumental version of the pre-chorus and then slides into 
a spacey bridge, “Another shooting star goes by . . .”, and then glides straight 
into the pre-chorus. Next, instead of going into a chorus, the song returns to 
a reprise of the verse, “There’s a story in my eyes. . . .”, and then it skips the 
pre-chorus and goes directly to the out chorus. Whew-boy! When Jim and his 
writing partner, Frankie Sullivan, were sitting at the piano at the Record Plant 
recording studio in Los Angeles with the producer, Ron Nevison, throwing 
around ideas, Jim wasn’t sure this unorthodox structure was going to work,

but the next day when they recorded it, it was magic. The experience taught 
Jim to not be afraid to play around with song structure. Take a look:

Listen to the songs of John Lennon and Paul McCartney and the various Motown 
writers. It’s a great way to learn about the variations of song structure.
Even though the songs in Table 2-7 are older, they set the template for much 
of the new music you currently hear every day and demonstrate some non-

“Drops of Jupiter” (written and performed by Train) is one of those songs 
that makes an immediate impression. Usually with brilliant songs like this, 
you remember where you were and what you were feeling when it first hit 
your ears. It’s an example of a song that takes a standard tried-and-true song 
form and twists it here and there to make it sound unusual and fresh — a 
pop/rock masterpiece. The song starts with the piano figure of the verse. The 
first verse contains the only reference to the song’s title. So much for the tra-
ditional wisdom of driving the hook into the ground — but that didn’t seem 
to hurt sales.
By the way, the music charts, such as Billboard, Radio and Records, and so 
on, have taken to putting the words (“Tell Me”) after the song’s title for those 
of us who can’t identify it by its cryptic title, “Drops of Jupiter.”
The chorus comes next, although it’s not a traditional type of chorus in that 
the title is never stated. After the chorus, a significant instrumental signature 
is created by a string section. We now hit the second verse. It follows the 
same structure of the first verse, except that the last line before the second 
chorus is extended for extra impact. The song cleverly uses modern-day 
references such as “tae-bo” and later on, “soy latte.” What’s unusual in the 
second chorus is that although the rhythm of the words and melody stay the 
same, practically all the words are different. The hook “Tell me” is about all 
that stays the same. Moving the action along in a chorus as opposed to mark-
ing time is unique.
A bridge follows the second chorus, although not in the traditional sense 
in changing keys and mood. It’s more chant-like and modifies the action by 
changing up the rhythm of the words. The arrangement then breaks down to 
just piano and voice again, and the song enters the final chorus. Again, the 
writers break form by combining elements of both earlier choruses into one. 
The song ends with the infectious “Na, na, na” refrain with alternating vocal 
ad libs lifted from various sections of the song. The last line is a brand-new 
variation on an earlier passage. The lyrics in this song are very open to inter-
pretation. The majestic tone of the music matches perfectly the broad scope 
of the lyrics.
 
There are some great songs out there that don’t play by the rules. The writ-
ers have ignored the standard forms to create something truly unique. 
“Drops of Jupiter” by Train can be corralled, kicking and screaming, into 
some kind of traditional form but it’s really a maverick. As an experiment, try 
challenging the listener by shifting your sections around to make your song 
stand out from the pack of cookie-cutter tracks. If your song becomes confus-
ing and unfocused when playing it for others, it’s time to go back to the draw-
ing board.

Practice Makes Perfect
Often the best way of learning a craft is taking the best examples you can find 
and start tearing them apart to see what makes them tick. Pick five of your 
favorite songs, which could be anything from a 1940s standard to the latest 
by Radiohead. Listen to the song and analyze its structure by writing out the 
lyrics (you can find accurate transcripts of lyrics on many music sites on the 
Internet or printed on the CD label). It should then be easy to note the song’s 
various sections by verse, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge, out chorus, and what-
ever other spare parts you may encounter. See if the songs you like the most 
follow any particular pattern — if so, you may want to pattern your song after 
that form.
 
When analyzing the structure of your favorite songs, notice the various ways 
in which the great ones push the boundaries of song craft to the max. As you 
listen and make notes, take an especially close look at the following areas:
 
 What is it about each section that sets it apart from the rest of the 
song? For instance, notice how the story builds verse to verse as the 
song unfolds, how the chorus lifts the song to new heights, how the 
bridge does its job by giving the listener some fresh chord changes and 
some new emotional ammunition.
 
 What is truly unusual or original in the songs you love the most? 
Most songs you encounter that have survived to make a difference in 
this world have one or more elements that elevate it above the pack. 
“We Built This City” (written by Bernie Taupin, Peter Wolf, Martin Page, 
and Dennis Lambert), the ’80s hit for Jefferson Starship, starts right out 
with the sing-along chorus. Certain songs defy logic by shifting their key 
signature down on the last chorus instead of up. Find those special ele-
ments in the songs that really get your attention.
 
 Where do the titles appear in your favorite songs? The traditional 
practice of placing the title at the beginning of the chorus is often disre-
garded by daring writers. Notice songs that position their title at the 
end of the chorus, in the verse or pre-chorus, or that dispense with it 
altogether.

Scales and Modes, Moods

In This Chapter
 Understanding major and minor scales

 Touring the different modes
 Checking out the pentatonic scale
 Exercising your scales and modes
S
ometimes you have more of an idea about the direction you want your 
melody to move in than which notes you’re going to use to create your 
melody. You probably have an idea of the mood you want to convey with 
your music, without thinking about whether the melody should rise, fall, or 
take on any specific shape. If you’re writing with a sense of directional move-
ment — that is, up and down the staff — there are times you can benefit from 
limiting yourself to notes within a scale or mode.
There are 12 different pitches in the Western chromatic scale. That’s the total 
number of notes that are available in any one octave. But there are many 
other combinations of those notes — other scales — and if you don’t know 
at least several of them frontward and backward, you should work on that, 
because it can benefit your composing tremendously. The other scales have 
fewer than 12 notes, boiling them down to as few as five or as many as seven.
 
 Diatonic scales have seven different pitches in them.
 
 Pentatonic scales have five different pitches in them.
 
In this chapter, the words scale and mode mean pretty much the same thing: 
a particular selection of successive notes within an octave. You will encoun-
ter both terms, so both appear here, too.

Major and Minor Modes 
and the Circle of Fifths
 
Different modes and scales can evoke different moods. Major scales are good 
for happy, lively, calming moods. The minor ones are great communicators of 
sadness, seriousness, and introspection.
Figures 3-1 and 3-2 show two examples of nearly identical melodies in terms 
of directional movement. Figure 3-1 is in a major mode, and Figure 3-2 is in a 
minor mode.

Play those pieces on a guitar, and you can easily hear the difference in mood 
between these two examples without even knowing what written key they’re 
in (we deliberately left out the key signature). The melody in Figure 3-1 is 
actually in the key of F major, and the one in Figure 3-2 is in F minor. Note 
that even though the directional shape of the notes on the staffs is identical, 
the pieces sound different because the first example is in a major mode and 
the second example is in a minor mode.
Figures 3-3 and 3-4 show the melodies with their proper key signatures.

Getting moody
It’s no big secret that playing a good song is 
an easy way to set the mood of a room. For 
some reason, that’s doubly true in film. How 
many times have you watched a film with a 
wall-to-wall soundtrack of busy, unconnected 
pop songs and had it spoil the picture for you? 
But how long does it take to get the creepy 
but incredibly simple soundtracks of films like 
Halloween or Friday the 13th out of your head 
after watching them?
The connection between music and mood 
isn’t even confined to the human realm, either: 
Birds, bees, and four-legged animals of all sizes 
modulate their vocal utterances to try to attract 
mates or scare away competition. And if you 
think dogs barking isn’t musical, take one more 
listen to the Jingle Dogs’ Christmas Unleashed.
The ancient Greeks believed that not only did 
music itself invoke mood and even provoke 
certain behaviors, but that the modes the songs 
were written in were just as responsible. The 
original name for the Greeks’ set of seven musi-
cal scales was échos, later renamed modus by 
the Romans who adopted the system.
Plato himself recommended that soldiers pre-
paring for war should listen to music written 
in Dorian and Phrygian modes (more on these 
modes later in this chapter). In a modern context, 
that would mean that before heading off for any 
great confrontation, one should listen to songs 
like The Doors’ “Light My Fire,” Steppenwolf’s 
“Born to Be Wild,” Jefferson Airplane’s “White 
Rabbit,” and Yngwie Malmsteen’s “Heavy E 
Phrygian.” On the other hand, Plato discour-
aged these same soldiers from listening to 
songs in the Lydian or Ionian modes because it 
would interfere with their bloodlust. Therefore, 
putting on R.E.M.’s “Man on the Moon” is not a 
good idea before going off to war.
Plato and Aristotle also believed that an affin-
ity toward certain musical modes were insights 
into a person’s character, and that people who 
were fond of music in the Ionian, Aeolian, and 
Locrian modes were too relaxed and easygo-
ing to do well in high-power political or mili-
tary positions. After reading this chapter, you 
may want to take a look at the sort of music 
you prefer listening to and see what musical 
modes most often pop up in your personal CD 
collection.

The Circle of Fifths (Figure 3-5) is a handy tool when thinking about scales, 
moods, and keys. Each position on the circle contains two keys: the major 
key and its relative minor, which share the same key signature. The major 
keys are given capitalized letters here, and the minor keys are in lowercase. 
In the Circle of Fifths, every time you move one letter clockwise from the 
C major/A minor position at the top, you add a sharp to the key signature. 
And at every point counterclockwise from C major/A minor, you add a flat. 
The number of sharps or flats in a key corresponds to the number of fifths 
away from C that key is located. For example, the key of D is located two 
fifths above C and, interestingly enough, has two sharps.
 
Here are a couple of tips for using the Circle of Fifths when you’re composing:
 
 When you’re writing something in a particular major key and you want 
to change the mood a little (maybe make it a little sadder or darker), you 
can use the relative minor scale of the key. For example, if your original 
melody was in G major, you could change to E minor for the sad parts. 
Doing this makes it unnecessary to change the key signature, though 
you may have to use a few accidentals (sharping or flatting individual 
notes) here and there. Figure 3-5 shows you at a glance which major 
keys coordinate with which minor keys.
 
 Another common practice in composition is to write the darker, sadder 
bits in the minor key of the original major. For example, go from a G 
major scale to a G minor. As you can see from the Circle of Fifths chart 
in Figure 3-5, the parts written in G major would be written with the key 
signature for G, which has a single sharp (F#). The parts in G minor, then, 
would require the signature from its relative major, which is B%. The key 
signature for B% has two flats: a B% and an E%.

Moods à la Modes
Just playing a mode or scale without any particular melody in mind can 
inspire you to come up with a melody. An easy way to start experiencing a 
few different modes is to play scales on all white piano keys, but starting on 
the different notes within the C scale. There are seven modes (often called 
church modes, although they’re really ancient Greek) that you can make this 
way because there are seven unique white piano keys in an octave.
For example: Play a scale from F to F using only the white keys. Note that you 
will play the B natural instead of the B flat that is found in the key of F major. 
It turns out, you just played a scale in the Lydian mode, and it sounds a little 
different from the old do re mi that you learned as a kid.

574
Book VII: Writing Songs and Music 
 
There are seven modes, just as there are seven white keys on a piano. You 
can try all seven modes by starting and finishing on other notes using only 
the white keys. Can you hear the interesting mood possibilities lurking in 
these modes? You can gain a lot of ideas by sampling the different modes and 
deciding which mode evokes which moods.
We look at all seven modes a little more closely in the following sections. 
It’s true that for simplicity’s sake we’re illustrating the modes using only the 
white keys on the piano keyboard. But of course, each mode can be based on 
any note, and the notes work the same on guitar. It’s the different pattern of 
the intervals between the notes that defines each mode.
 
A half step is the musical interval equivalent to a fret on a guitar. One fret is 
one half step. A whole step is two frets.
 
Quite a few other scales and modes aren’t used much at all in Western 
music — and by Western we don’t mean cowboy campfire songs, we mean 
European music and its descendents. Some non-Western scales have pitches 
between half steps called quarter tones. Some use intervals that sound odd 
or even out of tune to the Western ear. The subject of modes and scales is a 
huge one, but if you intend to compose music where a keyboard of some kind 
is involved, you probably won’t have any way of conveying pitches in some 
of the more exotic modes.
Ionian (the major scale)
When you play seven ascending white keys starting with C, you get the Ionian 
mode (Figure 3-6). To build an Ionian scale on another note besides C, you 
use the whole-step (W), half-step (H) pattern: WWHWWWH.
 
Figure 3-6: 
The Ionian 
mode 
should 
sound famil-
iar, because 
it’s the 
major scale.

Notice something familiar about this? You’re right — this is the same pattern 
used to build major scales today.

The Dorian mode is most commonly heard in Celtic music and early 
American folk songs derived from Irish melodies. Songs written in Dorian 
mode sound melancholy and soulful because the final note of the scale 
doesn’t quite resolve itself, so it feels almost like a question left unanswered. 
One of the most famous pieces based on the Dorian mode is “So What” by 
Miles Davis, from his famous 1959 recording, Kind of Blue.
Phrygian
Figure 3-8 shows the E Phrygian mode. To build a Phrygian mode on another 
note besides E, you would use the pattern HWWWHWW.

Most flamenco music is written in the Phrygian mode, which has a bright, 
Middle Eastern sound to it that works well with folk and traditional dance 
music. Many modern composers and guitarists commonly use Phrygian

modes with major scales (instead of minor scales) because it sounds brighter 
and less melancholic than the minor scale.
Lydian
Figure 3-9 shows the F Lydian mode. To build a Lydian mode on another note

The Lydian mode is the complete opposite of the Ionian mode/major scale, 
so it feels as solid and bright as a major scale but the intervals are surpris-
ing and unexpected. This is a popular mode among jazz musicians who enjoy 
using a mixture of major and minor chord progression in inventive ways.
Mixolydian

Mixolydian is similar to Lydian in the sense of having a major-scale feel with 
minor intervals, and it’s a great mode to work within to give a bluesy feel to 
your compositions. Mixolydian mode is another popular scale for solo musi-
cians looking for a counterpoint to the Ionian key of the song.

Aeolian (the natural minor scale)
Figure 3-11 shows the A Aeolian mode. To build an Aeolian scale on another 
note, the pattern you’d use is WHWWHWW. This should also look familiar to 
you — it is the whole-step, half-step pattern used to build minor scales today.

The intervals of Aeolian mode create the same feel as many modern blues 
songs. Songs composed in Aeolian mode have a strong sense of sadness. The 
final note of an Aeolian scale feels resolved in a completely different sense 
than the final note of the Ionian. If the Dorian mode reflects melancholy, the 
Aeolian reflects despair. Check out Neil Young’s “Cowgirl in the Sand” for a 
great example.
Locrian
Figure 3-12 shows the B Locrian mode. To build a Locrian scale on any other 
note, you would use the pattern HWWHWWH.

Locrian mode is considered to be so unstable that most composers declare it 
unworkable. Few songs are written in the Locrian mode, which has led some 
music theorists to label it a “theoretical” mode. You find it occasionally used 
in heavy metal. This mode exists because all seven notes of the Ionian scale 
could form it in a mathematical sense, but the relationship between intervals 
in the Locrian mode is difficult for many composers to work with. Music that 

578
Book VII: Writing Songs and Music 
is composed within this mode sounds unsettling, disturbing, and just a little 
bit off. Listen to the synthesizer melody at the beginning of Rush’s “YYZ” for 
an example, or try playing “Three Blind Mice” in a Locrian mode — it sounds 
like incidental music from a Tod Browning film.
These modes are good tools for writing tonal music (music that conforms to 
a scale or mode and adheres to a tonal center or key). By limiting yourself 
to notes within a particular mode — that is, notes that make some harmonic 
sense together — you may find it easier to write something engaging for most 
listeners. Your composition style is partly a product of your limitations, and 
modes are limitations. Working within limitations can help you define your 
style. It’s like tennis: It wouldn’t be as fun without the net and the lines that 
define the court.
The Pentatonic Scale
There is one kind of scale that is fairly common throughout the world — 
despite all the other musical differences among various cultures. That would 
be the pentatonic scale, also called the five-toned scale. As you find out in 
Books III and IV, the pentatonic scale is the guitar soloist’s best friend. One 
can refer to a major pentatonic scale or a minor pentatonic scale, but the 
notes of the major scale are shared with the relative minor key.
For example, Figure 3-13 shows a G major pentatonic scale, and Figure 3-14 
shows the pentatonic scale of its relative minor, E minor.

tonic scale

Notice that although these two scales have a different tonic note, they share 
the same five notes: G, A, B, D, and E (which are the first, second, third, fifth, 
and sixth tones of the major scale). Many of the other scales and modes 
around the world seem to revolve around this simple scale formula. Every 
rock ’n’ roll guitar soloist on the planet should be able to play a pentatonic 
scale without even thinking about it.
The Harmonic Minor and 
Melodic Minor Scales
Two commonly used scales that aren’t listed with the preceding modes and 
scales are the harmonic minor and the melodic minor scales. These scales 
differ from the natural minor scale (Aeolian mode) — which is basically a 
scale taken directly from a relative major — in small, but important ways.
 
 Harmonic minor sharps the 7th note in the scale (Figure 3-15). This note 
brings the scale a little closer to the A major scale, but other notes in 
the scale prevent it from sounding too happy.
 
 The melodic minor scale has different notes when the scale ascends 
than it does when the scale descends (Figure 3-16). It’s like a major scale 
with a flatted 3rd on the way up, and it’s a natural minor on the way 
down.

Melody Writing Exercises
 
Here are some suggestions of exercises to do while waiting to be inspired to 
write your song. And who knows? These exercises could well lead to songs.
 
1. Try to write a melody using notes from the C major scale while play-
ing a G major chord underneath.
 
 The scale from G to G is G Mixolydian mode now. If you want, you could 
add a flat 7th (F natural) to the chord you’re playing for a more playful-
sounding combination.
 
2. Write a short melody in a major mode (it could be your own or some-
one else’s).
 
3. Rewrite Step 2’s melody in a minor mode.
 
4. Write a short melody in a minor mode.
 
5. Rewrite Step 4’s melody in a major mode.
 
6. Improvise using notes in the C major scale while playing an F major 
chord.
 
 Sound mysterious? You’re in the Lydian mode.
 
7. Pick a different mode among the ones discussed in this chapter, one 
that sounds interesting to you, and try to write a melody that fits its 
mood.
 
8. Find the pentatonic scales for all major and minor keys.
 
 Hint: After you find the major, you can apply it to the relative minor.

T
he key signature of a piece of music governs the main notes within that 
piece. When you want to escape the key signature within that piece of 
music, you have to use accidentals (sharps, flats, and naturals) to indicate 
notes outside the key.
You have several octaves’ worth of notes on a guitar, but only the notes 
allowed by the key signature can be used without accidentals in that piece 
of music. The scale of the piece governs the music’s tonality — which means 
breaking free from the original key is a good way to add spice.
Therefore, if you have a song written in C major, the main eight notes that 
will appear in the song are C natural, D natural, E natural, F natural, G natural, 
A natural, and B natural. If your song is written in A major, the only notes 
appearing in that song will be A natural, B natural, C sharp, D natural, E natu-
ral, F sharp, and G sharp. In either of these keys, the chords are also made of 
some combination of the seven notes in each key.
In this chapter, you discover the basics of composing with chords: the 
moods of various chords, combining chords, creating rhythmic movement, 
using chord progressions and cadences, and putting together chords and 
melodies.

582
Book VII: Writing Songs and Music 
Chords and Their Moods
 
There are two types of major chords:
 
 Diatonic chords are built from the seven notes of a major key signature. 
The letter name of a diatonic chord (such as A major, A minor, or A aug-
mented) comes from the major scale the chord is built on.
 
 Chromatic chords are built from notes outside the major key signature, 
such as chords built on minor scales. Chords found within minor keys 
are a little trickier, because nine notes potentially can fit under a single 
minor key signature when you take the melodic and harmonic minor 
scales into consideration. (See Chapter 3 in Book VII for more informa-
tion about the melodic and harmonic minor scales.)
Because the natural, melodic, and harmonic scales are taught as separate 
scales for musicians to practice, there’s a misconception that you have to 
stick to one of these types of minor scales when composing music. But really, 
you can draw from all three types of minor scales within the same piece of 
music.
You can let your melodic ideas suggest different chords, for example. This 
can be a very good way to open up possibilities — by suggesting depar-
tures from your key center and adding color to your work. But you could 
just as easily start with a chord progression and build a melody from there. 
Thousands of compositions began with a sense of harmonic movement first, 
followed by melody.
Here’s an opportunity for your Muse to step in. Or maybe you could just put 
your hands on your guitar and listen for the possibilities. To excel at chordal 
composition you should have a strong knowledge of chords. You should, at 
the very least, have a working familiarity with following chord qualities in 
every key, which you get to explore in the following sections:
 
 Major and minor
 
 Major and minor 7th
 
 Dominant 7th
 
 Major and minor 6th
 
 Suspended 4th
 
 9th and minor 9th
 
 Diminished
 
 Augmented
 
 Minor 7th, flat 5th (also known as half-diminished)

No matter which key you’re in, each of those specific chords comes with its 
particular sonic character, called its mood, or quality. Therefore, if you know 
how minor chords are constructed, and you pick up the guitar and play some 
minor chords, chances are the sound that comes from that set of chords 
is closer to what you’re looking for than if you just started playing random 
chords.
Certain chords express certain moods. It’s really up to you what sort of mood 
is to be implied by each chord, but in the following sections we include a 
short list of our own observations, based on asking students to describe the 
feelings conveyed by these chords. There are many, many more chord config-
urations than just these, but the ones that follow are a good start. You have 
to decide for yourself how each of these chords makes you feel.
 
A root is the main note of the chord and gives the chord it’s name. In a 
C chord, for example, C is the root. A half step is the smallest interval in 
Western music — conveniently, and not coincidentally, each fret on a guitar 
represents change in pitch of a half step. A whole step is two half steps, or 
two frets. And when we say flat we mean the note one half step lower in pitch; 
likewise, sharp means the next higher half step.
Major
Major chords are happy, simple, honest, bold. They’re made from the 1, 3, 
and 5 tones of the major scale. To build a major chord using half and whole 
steps, remember: root + 4 half steps + 3 half steps (check out Figure 4-1).

and deep. They’re made from the 1, flat 3, flat 5, and flat 7 tones of the major

ber: root + 3 half steps + 3 half steps + 4 steps (see Figure 4-13).

It’s important to note that the character of a chord is strongly dependent 
upon its surroundings. For example, a dark and dissonant chord like a minor 
7th, flat 5th sounds dark and dissonant when out there on its own (see Figure 
4-14), but if used to pass from one chord to another, it doesn’t have the same 
feeling (see Figure 4-15).

Putting Chords Together
After you’ve decided on a chord progression for a section of your piece, you 
may find it useful to experiment with different chord voicings, or all the dif-
ferent ways the same chord can be put together. A simple triad (a chord with 
three different pitches in it) has three different arrangements of its notes 
within an octave.
A chord’s voicing can be arranged in the following ways:
 
 Root voicing has the root as the lowest note: C (root), E, G
 
 First inversion has the 3 tone as the lowest note: E, G, C
 
 Second inversion has the 5 tone as the lowest note: G, C, E
The examples in Figures 4-16 through 4-18 use the C major chord to illustrate.

ing for a C

If you already have a melody, you’ll find it useful in determining your chord 
voicings (the arrangement of the notes in the chord). Most often you’ll want 
the melody to represent the top notes in your chords. This will dictate which 
voicings sound best. If you don’t have a melody yet, choosing your chord 
voicings can help you write one. Try a few chord voicing changes and have 
your melody grab the top notes. If you don’t like the results, invert some 
chords and try again.
Creating Rhythmic Movement
 
When composing with chords, determining a rhythmic movement for your 
chord changes may help. What this means is that you’ll decide how often, 
and on which beats or accents, your chords will generally change. You could 
have a chord change every measure, every four measures, every two beats, 
or even every beat within a measure. The choice is yours, but remember that 
fast-moving melodies can sound awkward if the chords change too quickly. 
A general rule is that more frequent chord changes work better with slower 
melodies, but this, like most rules, can be broken from time to time.
Of course, the rhythmic movement of your chord changes can vary as your 
composition moves along (as shown in Figure 4-19). You don’t need to keep 
the chords changing at the same rate throughout the section of your piece.

Writing chord changes out first is just one way to create some underlying 
structure for your composition. You may want to find some locations in the 
rhythmic structure of your composition that lend themselves to pivoting 
your chords out of the key center. It’s not difficult to hear in your head where 
a surprise or a change harmonically would be good. Just don’t overdo the 
surprises and departures. If you’re driving down a bumpy road and you hit 
another bump, it doesn’t mean much. Lead the listener into your changes. 
Build drama, tension, and release.
“Rules” for Major and Minor 
Chord Progressions
One way to easily build tension and release in your music is to follow some 
of the simple rules already laid out for you hundreds of years ago by people 
like Christiaan Huygens and Nicola Vicentino. According to them — and the 
thousands of musicians who followed — certain sequences of chords, called 
chord progressions, sound nicer than others. Over time, a consensus about 
the “rules” of chord progressions has come about.
In the following lists, capital Roman numerals indicate major chords, and 
lowercase Roman numerals stand for minor chords. The numeral itself 
stands for the note on the major scale the chord is built on. For example, in 
C major, the I is the C major chord, the ii is D minor, the iii is E minor, the IV 
is F major, and so on. The ” symbol indicates a diminished chord, and the + 
symbol is used for augmented chords. (You can find out more about dimin-
ished and augmented chords earlier in this chapter.)
 
“Rules” for major chord progressions include the following:
 
 I chords can appear anywhere in a progression.
 
 ii chords lead to I, V, or vii” chords.
 
 iii chords lead to I, ii, IV, or vi chords.
 
 IV chords lead to I, ii, iii, V, or vii” chords.
 
 V chords lead to I or vi chords.
 
 vi chords lead to I, ii, iii, IV, or V chords.
 
 vii” chords lead to I or iii chords.

592
Book VII: Writing Songs and Music 
 
“Rules” for minor chord progressions include the following:
 
 i chords can appear anywhere in a progression.
 
 ii” or ii chords lead to i, iii, V, v, vii”, or VII chords.
 
 III or III+ chords lead to i, iv, IV, VI, #vi”, vii”, or VI chords.
 
 iv or IV chords lead to i, V, v, vii”, or VII chords.
 
 V or v chords lead to i, VI, or #vi” chords.
 
 VI or #vi” chords lead to i, III, III+, iv, IV, V, v, vii”, or VII chords.
 
 vii” or VII chords lead to the i chord.
As far as these rules go, they just mean (in the case of major chord progres-
sions) that a ii chord (such as D minor if you’re playing in the key of C major) 
sounds most natural when it leads to I (C major), V (G major), or vii” (B 
diminished). However, there’s absolutely no reason why you can’t go from a 
ii chord to a IV chord, for example — but bear in mind that it won’t be what 
listeners are expecting.
 
When it comes to departing from the rules, a little goes a long way. You may 
have to back off after using a couple of unconventional chord changes and 
play more conventional ones to satisfy your audience. Pop music especially 
adheres to the rules regarding chord progressions, and is even more didactic 
than classical music about what sounds “good” and what sounds “strange.”
 
Try the chord progressions with an added 7th to the triads to see if they 
sound acceptable to you. You’ll probably find that some sound good — and 
some, not so good.
Coming Home with Cadences
An important part of making your music (and audience) breathe is through 
the use of cadence, or a return to the I/i chord from a iv or a V chord. The 
longer you take to reach this point of cadence, the more tension you can 
build in your music.
This section covers the four main types of cadences:
 
 Authentic
 
 Plagal
 
 Deceptive or interrupted
 
 Half-cadence

 Chapter 4: Composing with Chords

A musical phrase can come to an end by simply stopping, of course, but if 
that stopping position doesn’t make “sense” to the listeners, they may not 
be very happy with you. Ending your song on the wrong note or notes is like 
ending a conversation with a non sequitur, and you may leave your listen-
ers a little uncomfortable. Some audiences are absolutely delighted to hear 
music that confounds their expectations, however, and this may be exactly 
the audience you’re trying to reach.
Authentic cadences
Authentic cadences are the most obvious-sounding cadences and are there-
fore considered the strongest. In an authentic cadence, the harmonic goal of 
the phrase is the 1 chord via the 5 chord (V or v, depending on whether the 
piece is in a major or minor key). The cadence occurs when you move from 
that V/v chord to a I/i chord, as shown in Figure 4-20.

cadences

common, 
obvious-
sounding 
ones.

∑

∑
Plagal cadences
The harmonic goal of a plagal cadence is ultimately the 1 chord via the 4 (IV 
or iv) chord, with cadence occurring when the 4 chord moves to the 1 chord. 
The progressions IV-I, iv-i, iv-I, and IV-i are all possibilities.
 
The plagal structure originated with Medieval Church music, which was 
mostly vocal, and is therefore often referred to as the Amen cadence. If you’re 
familiar with Gregorian chants at all, or even many modern hymns, then 
you’ve heard the Amen cadence in action. It usually happens (no surprise 
here) at the point where the chanters sing the two-chord “A-men.”

594
Book VII: Writing Songs and Music 
Plagal cadences are usually used within a song to end a phrase, and not at 
the very end of a song, because they’re not as decisive-sounding as a perfect 
cadence (Figure 4-21).

cadences.

Deceptive or interrupted cadences
A deceptive cadence, or interrupted cadence, essentially reaches an ulti-
mate point of tension on a V/v chord, just like the authentic cadence, but it 
resolves to something other than the tonic (I/i) chord — hence, the name 
deceptive. The most common deceptive cadence out there, used 99 times out 
of 100, is the V/v chord that moves up to a VI/vi chord. The phrase looks and 
feels like it’s about to end and close with the I chord, but instead it moves up 
to the VI instead, as shown in Figure 4-22.
Other deceptive/interrupted cadences include moving from the V chord to 
the IV chord, the V chord to the ii chord, and the V chord to the V7.
 
Deceptive cadences are considered one of the weakest cadences because 
they invoke a feeling of incompleteness.

Half-cadences
Half-cadences are a little more confusing than other cadences. The authen-
tic, plagal, and deceptive cadences all occur in musical phrases that resolve 
before the phrase is complete. In other words, with the other cadences the 
phrase starts at a point of rest (I/i) and moves through a series of chords to 
reach either a iv/IV or a v/V chord. It could be as easy as the I/i chord going 
straight to the V/v chord and back to the I/i, or it could spend 20 hours cir-
cling like a plane in a holding pattern between those points, but authentic, 
plagal, and deceptive will all musically release to the point of rest: the I/i 
chord.
Half-cadences are the only ones that don’t end this way. With a half-cadence, 
the musical phrase ends at the point of tension — the V/v chord itself. It 
basically plays to a chord that’s not the I/i and stops, resulting in a musical 
phrase that feels unfinished. Examples would be a V-IV progression, a V-vi 
progression, a V-ii progression, and a V-V7 progression. It’s called a half-
cadence simply because it just doesn’t feel like it’s done yet.
Fitting Chords and Melodies Together
Often, when you’re working with just a melody, the basic accompanying har-
mony is already there in your subconscious. The melody lends itself to the 
harmony so obviously that accompanying the melodic line is the easiest part 
of writing the music. You may be aware of which note in your melody repre-
sents the tonic note right away, and you may even be aware of very specific 
chord movements that are screaming out at you from your melody.
Likewise, that cool chord progression you came up with last night is eager 
to provide you with structural tones (also sometimes called chord tones) from 
which a melody can magically emerge.
In the following sections, you find out how to pull harmonies out of melodies 
and discover the power of chord changes.
Extracting harmony from melody
If you take a simple major scale and consider only the I chord (also called the 
tonic), the IV chord (the subdominant), and the V chord (the dominant), you 
can hear fairly simple and obvious suggestions of relationship between notes 

596
Book VII: Writing Songs and Music 
in the given key that might be used to accompany them. There are, of course, 
many other possibilities and substitutions, but here we stick with the I, IV, 
and V chords in the example shown in Figure 4-23.

You can use tones from within the chords (called, as we mentioned, chord 
tones) and string these tones together in various ways using non-chord tones.
First, Figure 4-24 is an example of a simple chord progression that you can 
use to extract some structural tones from.

Now you can extract a melody from these chords using only notes from 
within each chord — the chord tones (check out Figure 4-25).

Now you can add some passing tones. Passing tones close the gaps between 
structural tones. They make disjunct melodies more conjuct. Passing tones 
go in steps and end up stepping into the next structural tone (take a look at 
Figure 4-26).

If you step away from the tone before stepping back to it, it’s called a neigh-

Using chord changes
A chord change is a powerful thing. It’s hard to take a chord change lightly. 
That’s why you need to be picky about the choices you make regarding 
where in the rhythm of your music the chords change.
 
If your chords change every measure on beat one, that beat will be strength-
ened. If instead you place the chord changes on beats four and one, both of 
those beats will gain some gravity. A chord change brings some attention to 
any rhythmic subdivision. It’s a good idea to place chord changes strategi-
cally to emphasize the rhythmic feel, or groove, of your piece.
Often your music will benefit from adding more chords in between the struc-
tural chords you started off with. For this you can go back to your non-chord 
tones, as shown in the previous section. Some of the non-chord tones you 

598
Book VII: Writing Songs and Music 
added while stringing together your chord tones may provide rhythmic 
accents. Or maybe you just like these notes and want the listener’s attention 
drawn to them. So why not add chord changes at those same moments? You 
can call these passing chords.
Figure 4-28 shows the example again with all the non-chord tones that were 
added.

That makes for a richer, more colorful phrase, doesn’t it? The possibilities 
are limitless. You could have a chord change every beat, every half beat, or 
whatever suits your intentions. This would be a good time to study the ear-
lier lists regarding “rules” for major and minor chord progressions. Knowing 
which chords flow into which can be helpful here. And don’t forget about the 
moods you evoke with your choices. A study of jazz can provide you with 
some ideas about chord substitutions as well.

599
 Chapter 4: Composing with Chords
Book VII
Writing 
Songs and 
Music
On the other hand, there are times when a chord change is distracting and 
pulls away from the hypnotic, trancelike mantra of your groove. As an exam-
ple, Ravel’s Boléro (which was written intentionally as a piece with no struc-
tural development) pulls listeners along and drives them deeper and deeper 
into its feel. When Ravel exhausts the dynamic headroom of his orchestra, 
he surprises us and wakes us up into a new realm by changing the chord and 
the tonality all at once, near the very end. This alerts us that the climax is on 
its way (it also puts the orchestra in a range where there is some additional 
dynamic power to be tapped into). It’s totally unexpected and somewhat dis-
concerting, but he had to launch an ending somehow.
 
You’re okay when you can use an unexpected wake-up chord change as pow-
erfully as Ravel, but in the meantime be careful not to loosen your hold on 
the listener with too many chord changes if you’ve got a good groove on.
 
You can have more than one musical idea going on at the same moment in 
the same piece. Three or more are perhaps too many, because confusion 
ensues and the listener doesn’t know where to turn. You always want to 
retain a sense of focus, even when your music gets chaotic.
You could have your chords change in one rhythmic pattern and have the 
melody move in another pattern. Mixing it up like that would convey two dif-
ferent rhythmic statements. You might think of it as keeping the non-chord 
tones and the chord structure and throwing out some of the structural chord 
tones in your piece. Figure 4-30 shows an example with a tiny bit of polishing.

From what you’ve read in this chapter so far, it should be easy enough to 
reverse these processes if you had a melody to start with and were looking 
for the right chords to go along with it. You have to decide which notes in 
your melody are structural. Then you can determine the key of your piece 
and where you feel you need to accentuate your melody with chords. The 

600
Book VII: Writing Songs and Music 
challenge here is to be aware of the many harmonic possibilities available to 
you for harmonizing your melody. There are more harmonic possibilities in a 
single note than there are melodic possibilities in a chord.
Exercises for Composing with Chords
This chapter covers a lot of ground. The following exercises are designed to 
help you distill and apply the information in this chapter to begin your own 
compositions.
 
1. Harmonize an ascending 5th (one letter name clockwise around the 
Circle of Fifths; see Chapter 3 in Book VII for more on the Circle of 
Fifths).
 
 Find chords that fit with a D note held for two beats followed by an A 
above held for two beats. Ideas:
 
• Start with a D major chord.
 
• Start with a B flat major chord.
 
• Start with an E minor 7th, flat 5th chord.
 
• Start with a G major chord.
 
2. Try chord progressions at random.
 
 Write the names of a dozen or so chords on small pieces of paper. Make 
sure you include some of the ones that sound strange to you. You can 
use any chord in any key. Put them in a hat and shake them up. Pick out 
four or five of them and write them down in the order you picked them 
on some staff paper. Compose a melody that makes sense of this chord 
progression. You can add some passing chords if you like.
 
3. Lead Exercise 2 to a perfect cadence.
 
 Add chords and melody where needed. Give it a key signature.
 
4. Take any two notes and explore the chord combinations available.
 
5. Take any two chords and explore the melodic possibilities between 
them.
 
6. Listen to some familiar music and see if you can identify the non-
chord tones by ear.

601

Book VII

Songs and 
Music
 
7. Write a chord progression and extract the structural tones.
 
8. See how many different non-chord tones you can add and determine 
which ones work well for your style of music composition.
 
9. Invent a whole new melody by removing some of the original struc-
tural tones and leaving the non-chord tones.

his appendix functions as a quick reference to chords on the guitar. It 
covers all the keys and shows each key’s chords to the 7th degree.
The tricky thing about diagramming guitar chords is that the same chord can 
be built in many ways, in many different places on the neck. To make things 
easier, we only included chords that don’t go beyond the upper seven frets of 
the guitar neck.
Big black dots show where to put your fingers on the frets. An X above 
a string means you don’t play that string. An O above a string stands for 
“open,” meaning you play the string but don’t fret it. Also, for each diagram, 
the pitches for each open (non-fretted) string are, from left to right, (low) E, 
A, D, G, B, (high) E.

Appendix B
How to Use the CD
M
any music examples in Guitar All-in-One For Dummies are performed 
on the CD that comes with this book — 99 of them in fact — making 
the book something of a multimedia experience. In many cases, you see the 
music notation and/or tablature in a figure along with a pointer to the track 
number. The tracks on the CD are in audio CD format, so just stick it in your 
CD player, find the track you want, and press “Play.” You can also rip the 
tracks to your computer and play them on your portable music player.
The CD is especially helpful when you’re not yet reading music well, or when 
you’re just not sure how something is supposed to sound. Table B-1, later in 
this appendix, lists all track numbers, figure references, and track times (in 
minutes and seconds).
 
Keep the CD in its sleeve in the back of the book, rather than in your rack of 
CDs. Whenever you want to refer to Guitar All-in-One For Dummies (the book), 
the CD will always be right where you expect it. Also, try to get in the habit of 
following along with the printed music whenever you listen to the CD, even if 
your sight-reading skills aren’t quite up to snuff. It really does help. You 
absorb more than you expect just by moving your eyes across the page in 
time to the music, associating sound and sight.
Relating the Text to the CD
Whenever you want to hear what written music in the text sounds like on the 
CD, refer to the box in the upper right-hand corner, which tells you the track 
number and start time in minutes and seconds. Use the track skip control 
to go to the desired track number, and then use the cue button of the cue/
review function (also known as the “fast forward/rewind” control) to go to 
the specific time within that track. When you get on or near the start time, 
release the cue button, and the example plays.
If you want to play along with the CD, cue up to a spot a few seconds before 
the start time. Giving yourself a few seconds head start allows you to put 
down the remote and place your hands in a ready position on the guitar.

622
Book VIII: Appendixes 
Many of the music examples are preceded by a count-off, which is a metro-
nome clicking in rhythm before the music begins. This tells you what the 
tempo is, or the speed at which the music is played. It’s like having your own 
conductor going, “A-one, and a-two . . .” so you can hit the downbeat (first 
note of music) in time with the CD.
Some examples are recorded in what’s known as a stereo split. In certain pieces, 
the backing, or accompanying, music appears on the left channel of your 
stereo, while the featured guitar appears on the right. If you leave your stereo’s 
balance control in its normal position (straight up, or 12:00), you’ll hear both 
rhythm tracks and the featured guitar equally — one from each speaker. By 
selectively adjusting the balance control (turning the knob to the left or right), 
you can gradually or drastically reduce the volume of one or the other.
Why would you want to do this? If you’ve practiced the lead part to a certain 
example and feel you’ve got it down good enough to where you want to try 
it “along with the band,” take the balance knob and turn it all the way to the 
left. Now only the sound from the left speaker comes out, which is the back-
ing tracks. The count-off clicks are in both channels, so you’ll always receive 
your cue to play in time with the music. You can reverse the process and 
listen to just the lead part, too, which means you play the chords against the 
recorded lead part. Good, well-rounded guitarists work on both their rhythm 
and their lead playing.
System Requirements
Here’s what you need to know to play the CD on different equipment.
Audio CD player
The CD included with this book will work just fine in any standard CD player. 
Just put it into your home stereo system or boom box. Check out Table B-1 in 
the section “Tracks on the CD” later in this appendix for track descriptions.
Computer CD-ROM drive
If you have a computer, you can pop the accompanying CD into your CD-ROM 
drive to play the CD. Make sure that your computer meets the minimum 
system requirements shown here:
 
 A computer running Microsoft Windows or Mac OS
 
 Software capable of playing CD audio tracks (for example, iTunes or 
Windows Media Player)

623
 Appendix B: How to Use the CD
Book VIII
Appendixes
 
 A CD-ROM drive
 
 A sound card for PCs (Mac OS computers have built-in sound support)
Follow these steps to play the CD on your computer:
 
1. Put the CD in your computer’s CD-ROM drive.
 
2. Rip the tracks to your hard drive as you normally do with an audio CD.
 
3. If you have a digital music player such as an MP3 player or iPod, 
transfer the tracks to it as you normally do.
The specific steps you go through to transfer tracks to your hard drive and/
or digital music player depend on your computer platform and software. See 
your software documentation for help.
Tracks on the CD
Here is a list of the tracks on the CD along with the figure numbers, where 
applicable, that they correspond to in the book. Use this as a quick reference

Your comprehensive, hands-on 
guide to playing guitar
Have you always wanted to play the guitar? You can start today 
with these 8 minibooks. Covering both acoustic and electric 
guitar, this hands-on resource gives you all the instruction you 
need to play across multiple genres, whether you’re a beginner 
or an experienced guitarist. You’ll find plenty of tips for playing 
easier and more complex pieces — and for composing your 
own. Plus, you can play along with examples on the bonus CD! 
•  Gear up to start playing — understand the different parts of a guitar, 
find the right guitar for you, string and tune the instrument, and 
develop basic playing skills
•  Immerse yourself in sounds and technique — play major and minor 
chords, master left- and right-hand techniques, and play melodies in 
position and double-stops
•  Get ready to rock! — from Chuck Berry to Keith Richards to The Edge, 
see how the best play barre chords, hot licks, and sweet leads
•  Play the blues — explore rhythm and lead techniques, signature riffs, 
blues progressions, and the achievements of great blues guitarists
•  Go classical — learn about the history of classical guitar, combine 
arpeggios and melody, and sample different genres
•  Practice, practice, practice — try your hand at major scales, minor scales, 
and chord exercises to rev up stalled skills
•  Write songs and music — check out different song forms, understand 
modes, and compose with chords
Bonus CD Includes
