Preface
Completion of a minor thesis involves mastery of a range of accomplishments. It
requires that you read other theses, undertake an investigation, manage a large
number of references, assess the work of others, objectively interpret data, criti-
cally reﬂect on your own work, and master basics such as writing a long document
efﬁciently on a computer. Throughout this book we discuss the components of a
minor thesis—typically, the ﬁrst thesis that a student ever writes—and set out the
various tasks that you need to complete in order to ﬁnish the work successfully.
This isn’t our ﬁrst book on thesis writing; we are also the authors of the compa-
nion volume, How to Write a Better Thesis, originally written by David Evans and
published in 1995, and revised by us in 2003 and 2011. That book is primarily
intended for senior research students undertaking a thesis across a period of years.
In writing this new book, we focus solely on ﬁrst theses. Although we have relied
on content from the other volume (from which about half of this book is taken),
we have observed that the challenges of writing a minor thesis, especially given
the time and resource constraints, are very different. Another factor is that senior
research projects such as PhDs take a range of forms, whereas a minor thesis is—
and should be—the product of a more or less standard approach. Our goal here is
to help guide you through your ﬁrst piece of substantial research.
As in the earlier book, we have blended our voices to make the reading easier,
so we write ‘I’ rather than ‘we’ (except in this preface). We have blended
our research perspectives too, as one of us (Paul) has a background in the
social sciences and the other (Justin) works primarily in computer science. By
combining our perspectives and backgrounds, we believe that the book is made
more accessible, and captures the best of what each of us has to offer across the
disciplines.
David’s voice is prominent in our companion volume, and we are deeply grate-
ful to him and his estate for his text, and for inspiring us in our supervision of stu-
dents. While this new volume contains fewer of his words, it is strongly
inﬂuenced by his approach.
We are also grateful to Anna Zobel for the illustrations. Her sketches capture
for us the spirit of intensity and joy that successful study can bring.

Two Introductions
In this book, we draw on the experiences of two of our students. We introduce
you to them here, so that, when you come to our discussion of issues they faced,
you understand their background.
Let us ﬁrst introduce you to Anouck. Although she had been in Australia for a
few years, she was originally from France. Fluent in French and English, she had
also studied some Chinese. Anouck had completed one semester of a Master’s
degree, and during that time she earned good marks in each of her four subjects.
Having been in one of my (Paul’s) classes, she approached me before the start of
her second semester to discuss a minor thesis. Anouck told me that she was inter-
ested in language and media, a subject that I taught, and we agreed to meet to dis-
cuss some ideas. Later, at our ﬁrst meeting, she told me that she wanted to do a
minor thesis because she was considering doing a PhD. Anouck didn’t, however,
know much about theses, how they are structured, or how they are examined. As
her supervisor, I knew that she would need some guidance, but I was certainly
interested in her project.
Like Anouck, Mickey also had an interest in language, but his interests
stemmed from being an avid reader of stories, such as ﬁction published free by
authors on the internet. As an IT student, Mickey had observed that web search
tools were unhelpful for the task of ﬁnding new things to read, and that recom-
mendations on websites were unreliable. When he ﬁrst spoke to me (Justin), he
brought a broad question: What are the alternatives to conventional search meth-
ods for ﬁnding ﬁction? This question combined some of my own interests, so,
after a couple of meetings in which we talked through possible approaches, we
decided to work together, and in the process turned his rather vague idea into a
well-deﬁned project.
The experiences of Mickey and Anouck (and our many other research students)
have helped us to appreciate the challenges of undertaking a minor thesis, and this
is why we use their experiences as examples throughout this book.
How to Use This Book
In Chaps. 1–3, we explain what a minor thesis is and how the task of undertaking
a minor thesis should be approached. In Chaps. 4–8, we review the components of
a minor thesis in turn, from the introduction to the conclusion, and discuss what is
expected in each. In Chap. 9, we give guidance on editing and on preparation of
your thesis for submission.
You can read the book cover to cover, or dip in and out of the chapters. We
suggest that you turn to sections that you need at the time that you need them, and
compare our advice to that of your classmates and supervisor. But remember that
your minor thesis is your own work, and, when you have understood our advice
(and its limitations), you should feel conﬁdent about doing what seems to best ﬁt
viii
Preface

your own particular project and style, even if this differs from the approach we
have described.
You should also seek out additional resources. Other books give detailed
advice on writing style, referencing, development of effective graphs, experimen-
tal design, and so on; these are issues of relevance to academic writing of every
level, and our experience is that many students beneﬁt from such resources far
more than they had anticipated. Our focus here is entirely on the challenges that
are speciﬁc to a minor thesis. Use of this book will, we hope, set you on the path
to completion of a successful and satisfying project.

Chapter 1
Transition to Your First Thesis
Study at a college or university typically consists of a sequence of degrees: under-
graduate, graduate, and research. The pattern of coursework study is familiar to
every student. Across a sequence of subjects, where each one is somewhat inde-
pendent of the rest, you learn the fundamentals through a series of constrained and
discrete assessment tasks. In a research degree, in contrast, a student typically
works with a supervisor (or advisor) to undertake an investigation over a period of
years with little progressive assessment. To make the transition between course-
work and research, students undertake a minor thesis.
I wrote this book to help you produce a ﬁrst thesis. In this ﬁrst chapter, I situate
the work that lies ahead by deﬁning a minor thesis, setting out its purpose, sketch-
ing the roles of the student and the supervisor, considering the work that is
reported in the thesis, and indicating how it is likely to be examined.
Deﬁning a Minor Thesis
A ﬁrst, or minor, thesis is an extended argument of 5000–20,000 words that
reports on the outcomes of a supervised, individual research project, as part of a
graduate degree such as Honours or a Masters by Coursework.
A thesis, minor or otherwise, is an extended argument. That is, a thesis consists of
logical, structured, and defensible reasoning based on credible and veriﬁable
evidence.
In undergraduate degrees, a key task is to show that you understand a particular
concept or procedure through lab reports, tests, or essays. Much of the work is
descriptive: you provide some background information, check for completeness,
and then explain how you responded to the task at hand. For your undergraduate
assignments, you were responding to speciﬁc questions and prompts; in your
1

minor thesis, you are primarily in charge of the project. To be successful in a the-
sis, you need to argue, and continue to argue for thousands of words until you
reach a conclusion. Throughout that argument, though, you will have a fair degree
of freedom in your approach and style.
A thesis is much more than an extended essay or lab report. An essay is likely
to be a descriptive exercise aimed at the learning of fundamentals, or of writing
and reasoning skills; in contrast, a thesis is a proposition or claim that is defended
through a high level of insight or creativity.
Just as a minor thesis is not an extended essay, it is also not a Ph.D. thesis. A
minor thesis is typically a tightly supervised one- or two-semester project; a Ph.D.
is the outcome of years of substantially independent research. A minor thesis
reports on a single, straightforward investigation; a Ph.D. could well encompass a
series of studies, innovations, or types of analyses. While the two kinds of thesis
have many elements in common, the skills needed to complete a minor thesis can
be very different to those required for larger projects.
The Purpose of a First Thesis
A ﬁrst thesis provides an opportunity for high-achieving students to demonstrate
their ability to conduct an open-ended investigation.
The academic community views the minor thesis as a signal of ability and pre-
paration for undertaking a larger piece of work. Doing well on a minor thesis
demonstrates that you are ready to pursue a higher degree such as a Ph.D. Some
students, however, choose to do a minor thesis as a way of completing their study;
for them, the thesis helps to synthesize their overall learning and demonstrates
their maturity. Some students choose to do a minor thesis to see if they like
research, to help them decide whether they are going to continue in an academic
career or seek opportunities elsewhere. And some students have no choice—they
are enrolled in programs in which a minor thesis is mandatory.
You should use the minor thesis to acquire the learning that is of the most
value to you. If the thesis will be the end of your academic study, then you may
want to use it to develop your practical skills, or to deepen your understanding
of a particular area. If the thesis is a stepping stone to a Ph.D., you may want to
use it to understand the current research literature in a particular ﬁeld, or to gain
an appreciation of different experimental methodologies. You may ﬁnd that you
have a great deal of freedom in terms of the kind of work that is done as part
of the minor thesis, and you can use this freedom to focus on the activities that
give you the greatest beneﬁt. It follows that it is helpful if you know why
you are doing a minor thesis—a question that will affect the research area of the
thesis, the kind of activities you undertake, and, perhaps, who you choose as a
supervisor.

Transition to Your First Thesis

The Role of the Student
A minor-thesis student works with a supervisor to complete an independent
research project, and develops self-discipline, maturity, critical thinking, and a
strong awareness of the wider ﬁeld.
As you work to complete a minor thesis, you are signalling that you would like to
make an initial entry into a community of scholars. To be respected as a member
of that community, you must make appropriate use of specialized vocabulary,
have discipline-speciﬁc knowledge, demonstrate an understanding of major works
and researchers in the ﬁeld, and show that you can effectively apply accepted
methods of investigation. A successful minor-thesis student demonstrates indepen-
dence and maturity, and a sustained drive and resilience. Such attributes may
seem like a lot to expect, but, by undertaking a minor thesis, you should appreci-
ate that you are both producing a relatively large piece of work and becoming
socialized into a speciﬁc academic ﬁeld.
Though you have prepared for the project in your previous studies, undertaking
a thesis will accelerate your academic development. Perhaps for the ﬁrst time, you
must judge the value of contradictory research literature, gather materials that
haven’t previously been assembled, build an apparatus without knowing whether
it will work, and make sense of raw data. You may be working with other
researchers who are themselves uncertain about the outcomes they are striving
towards—and you must then explain their work and discoveries to others in an
academically rigorous way.
In contrast to an assignment such as an essay or lab report, it is very important
to know—now, and from this point forward—that a thesis cannot be left until the
ﬁnal days or weeks before submission. Self-direction, a sense of purpose, and dis-
cipline are essential. You need to start strongly and make sure you are mastering
all of the elements of the thesis as early as possible. You also need to remember
that you are doing the work in conjunction with your supervisor, not alone, and
thus you need to respect your supervisor’s constraints; for example, it isn’t reason-
able to take your time to complete your project, then dump a 20,000-word thesis
draft on a busy supervisor and expect feedback in a few days’ time. To get feed-
back, you will need to have completed drafts some weeks before the thesis is due.
Sadly, not all students produce a draft before submission, and such students rarely
achieve a high grade.
Regular feedback on your thesis while it is in progress is critical to success.
With an essay, you may have revised it once or twice and not shown it to anyone
before you handed it in. As you complete a thesis, you will need feedback from
your supervisor several times. Feedback on drafts of thesis chapters or an entire
manuscript typically consists of questions (‘What did you mean to say here?’ ‘Can
this be clariﬁed?’), recommendations (‘Remove this, it seems unnecessary’; ‘This
would be a good place to discuss so-and-so’s results’), and criticism. Many stu-
dents, at ﬁrst, are much too sensitive to criticism, and take it as a judgment on
3
The Role of the Student

their intellect or ability; however, to be a good researcher, it is essential that you
make the transition to seeing criticism as a necessary and productive aspect of the
overall writing process. To help students, I remind them that the manuscript is
what I’m criticizing, not them, and that I do respect their work. I also remind them
that some of my published work has been heavily criticized, and that I have to
revise much of my own writing in response to such comments from my collea-
gues. Critical review is part of the academic writing process.
The process of becoming socialized into the ﬁeld demands that you better
understand how academic researchers work. Earlier in your studies you probably
saw your supervisor mostly as a lecturer. Away from the lecture theatre and
in the ofﬁce, your supervisor is likely to seem ‘more human’ and yet, at the same
time, more demanding. Up close, you’ll better understand how academics
produce research, and how they work across the global communities of their sub-
ject area.
Successful minor-thesis students are mature, comfortable, and respectful; they
ask insightful questions, but understand the boundaries of the supervisor’s exper-
tise; they show initiative, but seek their own answers once given a bit of
guidance. My advice is to keep in mind that you are in transition from one form
of learning to another (that is, from directed study to independent searching), that
you recognize your abilities, and, most importantly, that you stay alert for oppor-
tunities to grow.
The Role of the Supervisor
The supervisor works with the student to identify a research area and research
question, ﬁnd research literature, deﬁne tasks and milestones, and organize the
thesis.
Students who are commencing a ﬁrst thesis typically know very little about research.
They may be inspired by research outcomes that they have encountered in their
studies—or, perhaps, heard about in the media—or by the academics they have met.
However, they usually haven’t yet grasped what ‘doing research’ involves.
The role of the supervisor is to guide students through the task of doing a the-
sis. Students bring experience and skills in a range of areas, such as technical abil-
ity in the laboratory or familiarity with analysis of written materials, and all
students have extensive experience of writing smaller documents, such as essays.
However, students do not have the depth of experience that lets them judge
whether a research question is suitable for a minor thesis, or that lets them assess
how to balance the effort of the many tasks that must be completed to yield a ﬁn-
ished thesis. They are unlikely to even have a clear idea of what those tasks are!
The supervisor should help shape the research question, introduce the student to
the different activities that comprise a minor thesis, and regularly meet with the
student to give feedback and guidance.

Transition to Your First Thesis

In other words, a supervisor is, in effect, explaining to the student how to
do research. This is a challenging task. In a very limited time—as little as one
semester—the supervisor must explain several kinds of activity that may be
entirely new to the student, while constraining and directing the project so that it
can be completed on time and with a strong outcome.
Another aspect of minor thesis supervision is that the student must be guided to
think, and act, like someone in the ﬁeld. By using appropriate style guidelines, or
using an accepted methodology, or approaching problems from a certain perspec-
tive, you indicate that you would like to be accepted in the ﬁeld. In some ways,
you are like a new member who is learning the tacit rules and cultural practices of
an established club.
The Student–Supervisor Relationship
Supervisors of theses have to strike a balance, between hands-on management of
the project and encouragement of independence, for students working under the
constraints of a tightly deﬁned project with pressing deadlines.
Supervisors are likely to work with you in three main ways. First, of course, a super-
visor ‘supervises’ you in your project. In this part of the role, a supervisor will cover
the technical aspects of your project such as guidance on methodology, the signiﬁcance
of a research question, and the ways in which research is presented and described in
your discipline. In this way, the role of a supervisor may also include management
of the project, development of deadlines, and assistance with tools or techniques.
The second aspect of supervision is the provision of advice. Your supervisor
should help you to develop the ability to produce independent research. As a
supervisor, I can assess, for example, where a student’s project is going and what
literature has been covered to date, but I may challenge the student to go further,
or to take bigger risks or a more daring approach—thus stretching essential skills,
such as critical thinking. At times, I may advise students to work harder and be
more disciplined; or alternatively to stop working too hard and enjoy life a bit
more. This is a rewarding part of being a supervisor, and happens as I get to know
my students in the later stages of their projects.
A third aspect of supervision is to be a preliminary examiner. In addition to read-
ing each part of the thesis as it is completed—the literature review, methodology and
experimental design, description of data sources, and so on—a supervisor should
read a complete draft and give considered feedback. When I do this, I detach myself
from the experience of supervision and treat the document as a stand-alone piece of
research. I ﬁnd it valuable to ask students to self-assess their own work, and then
meet with me to compare notes and consider questions such as how well the draft
meets the examination criteria. Further, I consider inconsistencies in structure: for
example, was what was promised in the ﬁrst chapter actually delivered in the ﬁnal
chapter? After our discussion, students revise their work before ﬁnal submission.
5
The Student–Supervisor Relationship

It bears thinking about what a supervisor does not do for minor-thesis stu-
dents. A supervisor can give advice, but on some occasions I have had to tell my
students, ‘it is your decision’, when they run into difﬁcult choices—ultimately,
the thesis is their work, not mine. Students need to learn to ‘own the project’ and
be proud of their eventual achievements, and should not regard themselves as an
assembly-line worker in an industrial knowledge factory. The content must be
primarily their own, and the writing even more so. A supervisor cannot step in
and rescue students who have found that they are unable to complete the work
themselves. A supervisor can advise and assist, but cannot take the project
over—when I see a project getting into difﬁculties, particularly in the late stages,
after the student has had ample advice and support, there may not be much more
that I can do. Such situations are not a pleasant experience, but they reﬂect the
fact that the student is probably not ready for extended research projects such as
a Ph.D. thesis.
As a supervisor, I am limited in the ways that I can be a time-keeper, discipli-
narian, or friend. Some students have asked me to set hard deadlines and severely
reprimand them if they do not meet them; I did not do this. Other students have
sought to become my friend—and may have observed that supervisors often have
close relationships with their Ph.D. students—but I need to maintain a professional
distance so that I don’t lose my ability to objectively evaluate the thesis. (A differ-
ence between a minor thesis and a Ph.D. is that, for the latter, the research is often
the product of long-term teamwork, and the supervisor may be as much colleague
as mentor; also, for a minor thesis the supervisor and colleagues will be the exami-
ners.) Finally, as happens from time to time, students seek help or advice on per-
sonal issues, but it is best to get such advice elsewhere; you should avoid
anything that undermines the ability of the supervisor to judge your work.
Find a supervisor you can work with. If you wonder whether the relationship
is going to be successful—perhaps the supervisor is too busy, or is patronizing, unreli-
able, or insensitive to your interests or skills—then maybe you need to look elsewhere.
Research Questions
Take the time to develop a good research question; once the question is settled,
the undertaking of the project itself is often relatively straightforward.
A key step in a thesis is to identify and develop a good research question. You
may be surprised to discover that there are entire books about research questions,
but such books have been written for good reason: development or clariﬁcation of
a question can be the inventive step of the research.
Indeed, it is often the case that a whole program of work can be characterized
by a question and the methods used to answer it. Similarly, work can be character-
ized as investigation of a hypothesis, that is, a tentative claim or statement, where
6
1
Transition to Your First Thesis

the aim of the research is to help establish whether the hypothesis is true or false.
In this book—in the context of a minor thesis—we use the terms ‘question’ and
‘hypothesis’ more or less interchangeably (but note that in other contexts they can
mean very different things).
Once you come to understand the question at hand, it may be that the whole
process of doing the thesis falls into place; it guides you to what literature to read,
what data needs to be gathered, and what methodology to apply.
On the other hand, with a poor question, it can be difﬁcult to get to any out-
come at all. If the question is vague, too ambitious, or so speciﬁc that the answer
is obvious, then you will struggle to ﬁnd a structure for your project or to produce
an interesting thesis. If the question doesn’t seem right, or troubles you in some
way, revise it.
A good research question has the following characteristics: it can be answered
within the scope of the study; the answer is not obvious at the outset and is likely
to be interesting; and it provides a starting point and direction for the study.
A research question crystallizes your learning and experience, as it is the result of
careful thinking about the literature and knowledge in your area, and more impor-
tantly about what is not known. A good research question demonstrates a keen
understanding of the ﬁeld.
Here are the factors I consider when assessing the suitability of a question for a
minor thesis:
• whether it is achievable within the time and resources available to the student
• whether it is a good match to the strengths of the student, and whether it is
within the student’s competence
• whether answering the question involves access to data and if so, whether the
necessary data can be obtained or created
• whether the question is of interest to the ﬁeld and can be clearly linked to exist-
ing research literature
• the extent to which the volume of research literature is likely to be manageable
• whether the answer to the question is already essentially known
• whether there is an obvious or straightforward methodology for investigating
the question
• the extent to which it is likely that a positive answer will be found.
As you think about your question, consider, for example, if little data is avail-
able or if the data is so voluminous that it cannot be analyzed in the available
time; or if software must be written and you do not have the skill to write it; or if
the investigation depends on insights and subtlety of understanding that only an
experienced researcher would be likely to have; or if the aim is to improve an
existing technology that is already highly reﬁned (meaning that success is highly
unlikely).
When I ﬁrst begin to work with a new student, I meet with the student over a
period of weeks, or even longer (often this is before the project has formally com-
menced), to talk through the student’s interests and brainstorm ideas. The list of
7
Research Questions

criteria above helps us to reject or reﬁne possibilities, and I ﬁnd that a cycle of
meetings, reading, and reﬂection soon leads to a question that is worth pursuing.
Part of what made Mickey’s project (described in the Preface) attractive to me
was that the question met many of the criteria listed above. There was good data
that could be used to test whether our ideas worked. Mickey and other members
of the online network of fans had built up lists of stories they had read and recom-
mended, and the websites where some of the stories were published could be auto-
matically (and legally) browsed to analyze the stories’ statistical properties; thus
reader evaluations could be matched against statistical evaluations. I also liked
this project because, once we had decided on a question (‘Can simple automatic
assessments of writing style predict whether a reader will like a story?’), and had
identiﬁed a source of data, it was reasonably clear how to do the project.
The project appealed to me for other reasons. It would require Mickey to con-
sider different methods for analysis of text, and to bring together and compare the
performance of different pieces of public-domain software. This in turn required
understanding of a range of technologies, via the research literature. The project
would also require him to think through the precise question he was trying to ask,
and to make sure that his tests actually addressed that question—a rigour that is
lacking in a great deal of research. As the project could be seen as part of a wider
ﬁeld of work, on problems such as analysis of tweets, news articles, and so on,
and indeed the ﬁeld of web search in general, I was conﬁdent that it would build
up a range of skills that would be of value to him.
The Perfect Question?
You should seek a strong question that suits your abilities, but other issues, such
as choice of supervisor, must not be neglected.
It is a mistake to focus on ﬁnding the ‘perfect question’ to the exclusion of other
issues. I have known students who felt that their minor thesis would only be satisfy-
ing if the question was dramatic in some way, or addressed a problem of global sig-
niﬁcance, or would lead to a major breakthrough. Students like this are misguided,
and are likely to ﬁnd themselves disappointed by the more disciplined questions
that a responsible supervisor will be prepared to consider. Other students feel that
there must be a question that is the best ﬁt to their own existing abilities, and
haven’t realized that a key purpose for doing a minor thesis is for them to develop
as researchers—and that any good question that suits their skills and background
will do this, and will be satisfying to pursue. Being overly concerned with a ‘perfect
question’ can lead to the student neglecting to consider whether they are talking to
the right supervisor. A poor ﬁt with the supervisor, I have found, is a much greater
threat to success of the project than a not-quite-perfect question.
Keep in mind that being unrealistic about what can be achieved is a common
cause of failure. Some students attempt to undertake a project that is appealing,
8
1
Transition to Your First Thesis

but of an utterly implausible scale (often against the direct advice of their supervi-
sor), and approach the end of their project with nothing to report but a few frag-
ments of preliminary work. These questions are like any over-ambitious goal:
foolish and unachievable. Such goals cannot be pursued in a systematic way, and
experienced researchers have little respect for colleagues who show poor judgment
by pursuing impossible aims. It is helpful to have a broad context for a project—a
global aim, such as, for example, rethinking the technologies underlying the web
so as to improve online privacy. But a single minor thesis can only be a small part
of this broad context, and should be as limited as possible.
A simple piece of advice about research questions is that they should be as
speciﬁc as possible yet touch on signiﬁcant issues. You will likely draft, and
redraft, and draft again your research question as your project proceeds, a process
that is an effective way of helping you to clarify your thinking. Remember that
your research question is crucial as a signal of your understanding of the area, of
what has been accomplished by previous researchers, and of what is currently
unknown.
Expect the Unexpected
A strong thesis demonstrates the ability of the student as much as it reports on a
piece of research.
The trajectory of a thesis is that you identify a problem that is motivated and
interesting, review the relevant literature, conduct a study, and set out to convince
examiners that your work makes a contribution. You have to write concisely,
under the constraint of limited time and resources, in a way that signals that you
can conduct research that aligns with what is done by scholars in your ﬁeld.
Written in these plain terms, it all sounds straightforward! If only it were always
the case. In a great many projects, as is true for any voyage into the unknown,
something unanticipated happens: you ﬁnd previous work on a similar question;
the data is incoherent and cannot be used; no clear answer is found; and so on.
Happily, such events are rarely a disaster. Dealing with the unexpected is a routine
part of the life of a researcher, and you can demonstrate your strengths by proving
yourself to be adaptable and, in the worst case, producing a strong thesis even
when good answers aren’t found.
I have seen many strong theses based on research that was essentially incom-
plete. What made them strong was the fact that they showed that the student
was capable—after all, it is the student, not the research, that is being examined.
In these cases, the thesis demonstrated that the research had been done in a
robust way and that the outcomes were plausible. With a frank description of
the work and a careful critical analysis of the strengths and shortcomings of the
project outcomes, the student showed the ability to do research and produce a
persuasive contribution to the discipline. These attributes, rather than a clever
9
Expect the Unexpected

question or strong positive results, are the qualities that signal the arrival of a
new, talented researcher.
Thesis Examination
From the start, keep in mind that your thesis is a document that is to be examined.
Your primary purpose in writing a thesis is to pass an examination. Throughout
the process of research and writing, you will have multiple opportunities for
academic development: you read literature, analyze data, build tools, and so on for
the sole purpose of informing the content that is included in your thesis. While the
doing of research and creation of new knowledge can be extremely rewarding, from
this perspective it is also a distraction, and you need to ﬁnd a balance between the
time you spend doing research and the effort you put into the thesis.
Areas for examination typically include:
• organization of the thesis
• clarity of expression
• demonstrated grasp of the problem and of the area
• understanding of and insight into the research literature
• appropriateness and correctness of the research methodology
• quality of the presentation and interpretation of the results
• understanding of the outcomes as demonstrated by critical analysis of the
research
• understanding of the implications of the results
• novelty of the question and resulting contribution.
Note that areas such as ‘signiﬁcance of the research’, ‘importance of the out-
comes’, and ‘theory building’ are not listed here. The project is likely to have
embodied original research, but the focus in examination is on the standard to
which the work was done. Indeed, the main thing being examined is the student.
If the thesis makes a persuasive case that the author is a careful, insightful, and
resourceful learner and author, then it will pass.
Typically, minor theses are examined internally within your department, often
by academics who may have taught you in coursework subjects. If you haven’t
done so already, obtain a copy of your departmental or faculty guidelines for minor
theses, which may well include speciﬁc criteria for examination. Though such cri-
teria can vary a great deal in the detail, the three main criteria for success are: to
show that you can sustain a critical, well-supported argument; that you can insight-
fully review previous work; and that you can competently do research—that is,
depending on your discipline, undertake activities such as the gathering of data,
implementation of tools, examination of materials, and interpretation of outcomes.
10

Transition to Your First Thesis

Of the criteria, the demonstration of critical thinking is evidenced in attitude.
Was the student sceptical, yet respectful, of the material at hand? To what degree
was the thesis synthesized and insightful (thus demonstrating intellectual mastery
of the subject matter), or to what extent was it summarized and treated with either
awe or disdain? Solid critical thinking comes through maturity, conﬁdence, and
authority, and is shown by students who seek to engage with issues and not just
simply comment on them.
Methodological competence is evidenced by a critical, reﬂective approach to
design of the project. For me, such competence is shown when several options are
available, but the student has argued that, of the many choices, one is preferable,
and has then assembled evidence to support the claim. It is also shown when the
thesis includes a reﬂection on the activities that were part of the project, discussing
what could have been done better, and showing that the student has a clear under-
standing of the shortcomings of the work.
In my department, we are each assigned a couple of minor theses to examine
and mark at the end of every semester; sometimes we are assigned theses that are
outside our areas of expertise. Individually, we read and assess the projects, and
then hold a collective examiners’ meeting to discuss and calibrate our scores. At
these meetings, the supervisor is present as well as senior and junior academic
staff. Each examiner must justify the reasons for giving a minor thesis a particular
score; the supervisor has some say, but, in general, the collective view of my col-
leagues determines the outcome.
As I’ve listened to my colleagues over the years at such meetings, I’ve come
to recognise a range of shortcomings typical of weaker projects. First, one key
criticism is that the work has a strong start but a poor ﬁnish; we tend to suspect
that the student started with enthusiasm, but did not sustain sufﬁcient interest
and discipline. The scope of the project may have not been sufﬁciently con-
strained, or it was simply too ambitious for a minor thesis. Second, I’ve heard
many times that the methodology is unclear and thus the project could not be
easily replicated, which makes the work seem preliminary or exploratory. Third,
examiners do not take kindly to work where there is a lack of structure, sign-
posting, or awareness of the needs of the reader. Academics are busy, and do
not like to have to search for information or details that a student has not orga-
nized in a convenient way. Fourth, examiners have noted that a thesis has inter-
esting results but overall is sketchy, perhaps because the student didn’t allow
time to do the writing. Fifth, and perhaps most serious of all, the student has
treated the project as an undergraduate exercise in reporting, description, tool
building, or data gathering; the work does not demonstrate that the student has
done much actual research, and the thesis appears to be more like a diary of the
project rather than a critical investigation. In my view, these shortcomings stem
from a lack of organization from the start of the project, a failure to appreciate
the time that is required at each stage, or a failure to understand what it means
to be a research student.
11
Thesis Examination

To some extent, such issues can result from poor supervision, but, in my
experience, more often the cause is that the student hasn’t reﬂected on what the
project is supposed to accomplish. If you take the time to appreciate the role that a
thesis plays in the creation of, and argument for, some new knowledge, it will
help you to produce a strong thesis of enduring value.

Chapter 2
Getting Organized
Completion of a minor thesis can be like a sustained run. While an essay can
seem like a dash from start to ﬁnish over a short distance, a minor thesis requires
greater endurance, a more measured pace, and a controlled intensity of effort.
There is little scope for delay or false starts, and to ﬁnish well you must start well.
A strong start for a thesis involves understanding what is required and preparing
appropriately, as well as the development of productive habits and attitudes. These
issues are the topic of this chapter.
The Right Attitude
From the start, strive to be independent, resilient, and productive, and learn to
work at a sustained high level of activity.
Many students, accustomed to the pace of coursework subjects, have little
experience of long-term or medium-term projects. Some students have achieved in
their earlier studies by last-minute cramming for exams and by completing their
assignments in intense bursts of activity over a few days, even staying up all night
as a deadline approaches. These students, seemingly strong in their coursework,
often ﬂounder when they undertake a thesis. Despite advice about setting deadlines,
milestones, and working steadily, some students still attempt to do everything at the
last minute—and fail to get a good outcome. In contrast to their success in under-
graduate or early graduate coursework, which largely consisted of completing
deﬁned tasks and short-term goals, they struggle to work independently across an
entire semester or two.
To successfully complete a minor thesis, you must be organized from the very
start. In particular, you need to shift your attitude from being a sprinter to being a
mid-distance runner. A sprinter covers a good distance very quickly, and then
13

collapses in exhaustion. A mid-distance runner maintains a moderate but steady
pace, even holding back a little to conserve energy, then picks up speed towards
the end. As you proceed, you do not just head straight for a distant goal, but you
need to pass a range of landmarks: reading, analyzing, gathering data, doing
laboratory work, drafting, drafting again, and polishing, and all this while coming
to grips, for the ﬁrst time, with what is involved in doing research.
Thus you need to shift your attitude from coursework student to researcher.
For example, a key shift in attitude is to understand that all of your chapters will
need to be drafted, revised, and substantially rewritten. One draft is not sufﬁcient
to meet the standard of quality that is required at this level of research, and even
two or three may not be enough.
A second shift is to set and maintain milestones as you undertake your journey.
With milestones in place, you are able to quickly judge and self-assess your abilities
at any given point along the way. Those milestones must be substantial, measurable,
and taken seriously. Some possible milestones are listed later in this chapter.
The third shift concerns your relationship to your supervisor. As a research stu-
dent, you work individually with one or two academic staff, or perhaps with a
small group of more senior students. The project is yours alone, and you are not
replicating work that other students are doing at the same time; you are not part of
a larger cohort all doing the same thing. Meetings are usually very focused, with
an expectation of progress every week. You must learn to be accountable for your
work, and be ready to receive detailed critical review.
Discipline
Amid competing demands, make a strong effort to stay on track.
Projects, big or small, often take longer than originally expected. Even if you
set a realistic time schedule and milestones, you are likely to slip over the course
of your project; you probably won’t achieve all the milestones on time. I’ve had
very few minor thesis students who have completed them early! However, these
milestones are the best mechanism you have for ensuring that you are on track to
successful completion. They remind you to stay alert, and, if you get behind sche-
dule, you are able to quickly respond.
If the timetable is to be useful, you need to be honest with yourself about the
amount of time you are spending on your project; if you are missing milestones,
you need to increase your weekly commitment. It is your job to stay on track and
produce the work. To do this, you must remain disciplined and conscious of your
own work habits and style. My main suggestion is to be systematic, habitual, and
predictable as you work so that you make regular progress at a steady pace. This
is easy to say, but very difﬁcult to do in practice.
At my university, the usual expectation for a minor thesis is that it is equivalent
to two to six subjects, where a subject requires a total of around 150 hours, or
14
2
Getting Organized

10 hours per week; some theses are as small as a single subject, or as large as 10.
Many students do not always maintain the necessary twenty or forty hours per
week on their project, but the best ones make steady progress over the time they
have available. As a supervisor, it is difﬁcult to respond well to work that is see-
mingly done over just a week or two. Sometimes, I feel as if I’m being held hos-
tage to a deadline. However, as a busy academic, I cannot always respond as
quickly as a student under pressure would like, and such delay can cause conﬂict.
Keep in mind that your supervisor is likely to have many commitments and dead-
lines in addition to working with you.
Often, I’ve said to my students, ‘Everyone is smart, but the best students are
organized’. I do mean this. Eventually, everyone passes a point where their smart-
ness (whatever that is) is no longer enough; they have to be systematic in order to
achieve.
The pacing depends on the scale of the thesis. For theses that must be completed
in a single semester, equivalent in size to two to four subjects, being successful
means that a signiﬁcant milestone passes almost every week, a speed of work that is
a challenge to both student and supervisor. For a two-subject thesis, you are likely to
be simultaneously undertaking other subjects, with their own demands: assignments,
workshops, and so on. Almost no one is good at balancing short-term deadlines
(‘My assignment is due this Friday.’) with vague longer-term goals (‘I need to make
progress on my thesis.’). For this reason, it is critical to take milestones seriously.
Some minor theses are spread over multiple semesters, which also means that
progress can be made between semesters. For a student who is simultaneously
doing coursework, it is very easy to think that this current semester is difﬁcult or
exceptional in some way, and to almost forget about the thesis for a while—a
behaviour that is likely to have disastrous consequences. (It is for this reason that
some departments impose intermediate deadlines, such as submission of a litera-
ture review, a seminar presentation, or an experimental design.) While it may
seem that, with multiple semesters, you will have ample time, this is an illusion—
a great many students enter the ﬁnal semester of their minor thesis far behind
schedule, and must work desperately hard to ﬁnish. Early discipline will make
your thesis a much more rewarding, and pleasant, experience.
Milestones and Schedule
Anticipate the time and effort needed to meet deadlines and complete the thesis.
One of the ﬁrst steps in a thesis project—once the area and question have been
established, and perhaps even before the question is ﬁnalized—is to establish a
realistic timetable. A work schedule needs to cover every aspect of the project, not
just the thesis writing, so it needs to allow time for elements such as reading the
literature, gathering and analyzing data, lodging and waiting for a response to an
ethics application, building tools, and waiting for a supervisor to ﬁnish reading
15
Milestones and Schedule

thesis drafts. There may also be explicit milestones imposed as requirements by
your department.
The timetable is likely to evolve as the project develops, but in my experience
it is essential to have a current version right from the start. The timetable forces
you to break the project into separate activities, and this may be the ﬁrst time
that you have to think through what the activities are. Also, the timetable com-
mits your supervisor to some activities too, and thus is a useful way for you to
ensure that your supervisor will be available when needed; you may ﬁnd out, for
example, that your supervisor will be away at some point during your project,
and the timetable means that you must ﬁgure out suitable arrangements for that
period.
Once you have a supervisor, in very broad terms the four main activities
involved in a minor thesis are:
1. Get started: ﬁnd a problem and question, and establish milestones and a time-
table. (Yes, a key milestone is establishment of the milestones!)
2. Discover, read, and synthesize the relevant literature.
3. Build tools, gather and analyze data, and develop the key arguments—that is,
‘do the research’.
4. Write the thesis.
You will ﬁnd that these things overlap; in all likelihood, at some stages in the
project you will be reading literature, doing research, and writing all at the same
time.
My suggestions here may be too high-level to use as speciﬁc, measurable mile-
stones, but they are a starting point for ﬁguring out what the milestones should be.
These will vary from project to project, but some examples follow. I’ve indicated
a percentage on each as an indication of how far through your project you might
be when you reach that milestone. (Of course, every project will vary.) For exam-
ple, 25 per cent means that you should be a quarter of the way through, and
90 per cent means that you should be almost done.
Get yourself organized: set up your workstation, list some milestones with plau-
sible dates, and write an initial draft of your problem and question. (10 per cent)
Lodge a research ethics application, if needed, and identify your data sources.
(15 per cent)
Identify what tools you need to build and an approach to building them.
(20 per cent)
Complete a ﬁrst round of identifying relevant literature and organizing it into
an early draft of the literature review. (25 per cent)
Create a draft of the ﬁrst chapter to set out the context, motivation, purpose,
scope, and overall approach to the study. (40 per cent)
Run a cycle of preliminary experiments, to gather observations and verify that
your systems work as expected. (40 per cent)
Complete the ﬁnal experiments. (60 per cent)
Analyze the data and produce a draft results chapter. (70 per cent)

Getting Organized

Give a full draft to the supervisor, and hold a discussion about the strengths
and weaknesses based on examination criteria. (80 per cent)
Respond to supervisor comments, and edit a complete ﬁnal draft of the thesis.
Print and submit the thesis, on time. (100 per cent)
These really are just examples, but illustrate the kinds of activity that should be
captured. Note how early the ‘research’ part of the project should be complete—
I’ve suggested 60 per cent as a reasonable mark for wrapping up experiments and
70 per cent for completing the analysis of the results.
The milestones break the monolithic task of ‘doing a project’ into small, achievable
goals, each one of which takes you closer to a completed thesis. This is a good point to
remind you of the importance of attitude: steadily achieving each milestone in turn, at
a consistent rate of work, is the most certain way of completing a strong thesis on time.
I encourage students to submit substantial work to me on a regular basis, either
for review or simply as a way of being open about progress; if the work has been
reviewed, I expect the student to act and revise in line with those reviews to
improve the work. However, I notice two contradictory patterns of behaviour.
Some students repeatedly delay and make excuses when I ask them for work,
because they don’t want me to see the manuscript until it is polished. Delays, in
the hope of perfection, are a serious mistake. It means the student may be revising
material that isn’t suitable for a thesis at all, or is much too detailed, or is discuss-
ing topics that are irrelevant. These students may not have understood that a thesis
is shaped by both the student and the supervisor.
On the other hand, some students use me as a sort of dumping ground for
poorly written drafts that consist mainly of brainstormed material. They seek
immediate response, and wait to be given the signal to continue. My role in the
early stages, however, is not to clean up the writing, but rather to give feedback
on what should or shouldn’t be included, and on how the subject matter should be
approached. I often suggest to students that they form collaborative writing and
review groups with other students, to gain mutual feedback on drafts and ideas.
Writing at a Computer
Make an effort to learn word processing well, especially the challenges of author-
ing a long document.
Writing an extended document such as a minor thesis is very different from writing
a shorter work. Many students know the elementary features of word processors
that are sufﬁcient for a 2000-word essay, but not the more advanced features that
help authors to maintain consistency of style and presentation across a greater scale
of work, for which manual checking can become painfully laborious and where it is
essential to have automatic maintenance of elements such as section and ﬁgure num-
bers. You need to become acquainted with software that automatically maintains
17
Writing at a Computer

bibliographies; mechanisms that create indexes and tables of contents; tools for
professional-standard illustrations; and strategies for keeping versions and backups.
On the other hand, some students tend to over-rely on some of the functions of
word processors, such as grammar and spelling checkers, which may be designed
for general writing rather than the demands of communication within a speciﬁc aca-
demic community. Learning to make effective, appropriate use of a word processor
is a key step towards timely completion of your thesis, and it is a mistake to assume
that even long familiarity with a particular word processor means that you are using
it well as a research tool (or that it is the right choice for your new activity).
Today, the most widely used general-purpose word processor is Microsoft
Word, or the OpenOfﬁce equivalent; in the mathematical and physical sciences
many researchers use the more technically oriented markup-based LaTeX. I will
not go into the speciﬁcs of these word processors, but encourage you to use
resources such as advanced guides and manuals to ensure that you are using them
well—even an occasional online tutorial can be surprisingly rewarding.
A typical word processor can be viewed as a suite of separate tools, perhaps
bundled together under a common user interface. These tools might include an
editor, for entering and modifying text; spelling and grammar checkers; a biblio-
graphy database; a line-art environment; and a system for laying out the text in a
form suitable for printing or for viewing on screen. A word processor allows the
style of a document to be separated from its content, and the two issues are impor-
tant at different stages of the thesis creation process.
Writing Tools
Make appropriate use of writing tools, but, ultimately, judgments should be made
by you, not by software.
Most word-processing programs include a spell check function, which checks every
word you have typed against a dictionary built into the program. Do not ignore
it! Few people are infallible spellers or proofreaders and it is only rational to have
oddities questioned. However, although the spellchecker is good at picking up typo-
graphical errors, it can’t make decisions for you. Typical problems are proper names
(people’s names or place names), and words for which there are alternative spellings.
In the case of proper names, the temptation is to tell the program to ignore its ques-
tionings, and go instead to the next area of doubt. This is a mistake: you should
check any proper name yourself and, when you are satisﬁed that you have got it
right, add it to the dictionary. Keep in mind that these are general-purpose tools, and
will not always be perfect for specialized applications such as thesis writing.
On a related note, don’t rely on the spellchecker to proofread for you; although
it will pick up misspelled words, it won’t distinguish between, for example, there
and their, or affect and effect. Similarly, it won’t tell you if you have left a word
out. The second problem is words for which alternative spellings are permissible
18
2
Getting Organized

(-or or -our and -ize or -ise are the most common). The most important require-
ment here is that you be consistent. Before you start, determine your preferred
spellings for these words, and keep to them.
Grammar-checkers apply several kinds of checks to each sentence including:
• Does it contain a verb?
• Is it missing connecting words?
• Does the subject agree with the verb (plural subjects must not have singular
verbs)?
• Is the verb in the passive voice (permissible, but should be used sparingly)?
• Are stock phrases being used (such as ‘over and above’; ‘in order to’, ‘part and
parcel’)?
You may think that your English is better than that of the grammar-checker—and
some of the time you will be right—but my experience is that they are often useful,
and it is essential to use a grammar-checker at least once before ﬁnalizing your thesis.
Some word processors have ‘track changes’ functions. These allow you to alter
a document, see what you have done, and later decide whether to ‘accept’ or
‘reject’ your decisions. They can be used for collaborative work on documents
with multiple authors. Take note of such functions and learn to use them, but not
to excess. Often, students worry too much about every word they have typed to
the detriment of their creative processes.
Thesis Templates
Lay out a consistent structure and style that encompasses the whole of the thesis.
A completed thesis should have a ‘look and feel’ that is consistent from beginning
to end. This look encompasses the use of fonts, line spacing, text width, headings,
table layouts, and so on. Templates are used to help create consistency. Online,
there are many thesis templates available, as well as academic-paper templates
and the like, for a range of word processors. You can search, for example, for
‘APA style template’ and hundreds of options will be returned, or you can create
your own template based on departmental guidelines. Perhaps you can get a
template from your supervisor or from a previous student.
But why use a template at all? First, templates help you to control formatting
throughout the long document. In contrast to a 2000-word essay, it is extremely time-
consuming to manually correct (or even just check) the style of every paragraph in a
20,000-word document. Second, the template helps you to easily produce a table of
contents and lists of tables and ﬁgures, each of which may be required as part of
the front matter of your thesis. Third, without use of a template, the behaviour of some
word processors is unpredictable—moving a paragraph by cut-and-paste can change
its appearance, for example, which is both frustrating and completely avoidable.
The main reason to use a template is that it helps you to see the entire thesis
from the start and throughout the entire project. Many students devote too much
19
Thesis Templates

space to the background and literature review, and do not realize that they need to
reserve some of the word count for other important components of the thesis.
Using a template, you will be much more aware of how many words you can use
for the review of literature, and how many are needed for the methodology sec-
tion, and how many are then left for the results in the ﬁnal discussion. Also, by
using the template, you can anticipate where certain sections will have to go, and
write ideas directly into the thesis at the moment of inspiration.
When I teach thesis writing, I use the metaphor of shopping in a supermarket
as a way of encouraging students to map their overall argument through a tem-
plate. A successful shopper, before entering the store, will have a broad idea of
the purpose of the shopping and maybe even a few key recipes in mind. With that,
the shopper knows what to buy to stay within the budget and time available. The
unsuccessful shopper, on the other hand, will buy a random set of goods, and then
be unable to create a balanced meal from what is available. For me, a template in
academic writing helps by providing an overview of how an argument is devel-
oped; like a good recipe, it sets out the essential ingredients to guide you, and
yet allows and welcomes the contribution of individual talent and tastes.
Remember that one of your goals throughout the entire process of producing a
minor thesis is to become a member of the research community in your chosen
academic ﬁeld. Make an effort to produce a thesis that looks like the product of
someone who belongs in that community; that is, follow the ﬁeld’s conventions,
styles, and formatting. For me, one of the ways that students signal their intent to
‘belong’ is through the appropriate use of the standard styles of the discipline,
including such things as how to format citations, create graphics, and set out
tables. To examiners, ﬁrst impressions count.
Present Well
The ‘look’ of your thesis helps signal your entry into the research community, so
take the time to ensure that the thesis is presented in an appropriate form.
The ﬁne details of the style of your thesis may not become settled until it is almost
ﬁnished, and I strongly encourage that, in the early stages at least, your focus is
on creation of content rather than on how it appears on the page. Nonetheless,
right from the start you need to write within the constraints of a style—for
example, ensure that all headings of the same kind, such as chapter titles, are
displayed in the same way.
Which format do you adopt? I suggest that you use a thesis style that is already
in use in your department, and it may well be that your department has speciﬁc
requirements. You should also be aware of ﬁeld-speciﬁc guidelines. The key is
that you use a deﬁned style from the start, so that you can easily change the
appearance of the whole thesis if you want to do so. Pay particular attention to the
way you cite references. Your professional handling of references is one way that
examiners assess your readiness to enter the community of scholars. If you are
sloppy, or your text and reference list are inconsistent, or you perhaps fail to cite a
20
2
Getting Organized

work, you are signalling a lack of respect for colleagues. One way an examiner
checks to see whether you know what you are talking about is to check the refer-
ences as you cite them. Conversely, you shouldn’t put entries in your list of refer-
ences unless you have cited them. Read your own text as an examiner would,
checking the list every time you come to a citation.
Pay attention to elements such as tables. Compare your tables to those in a jour-
nal in your discipline, for example. If you used the defaults in your word processor,
it is likely that your tables won’t look right, and in any case, your word processor
may not have a default for table captions or other elements that you need.
Using a style means that, once you have established a pattern, you can easily
stick to it and the reader will get the same message every time. For example, sec-
tion headings, wherever they appear in your document, will always be in the same
font and of the same size. They should always have the same space separation
from preceding text, and always have the same space separating them from the
following text. If you have two levels of headings (main headings and subhead-
ings), they should be clearly distinct from each other.
A thesis consists of several different parts that need to be tied together with a set
of conventions. Without a standard format across the entire document, the work
will appear random and unprofessional. For example, you should put all chapter
headings on a new page, using the same style—that is, the same font, justiﬁcation,
and paragraphing. You should give all major section headings a style that is differ-
ent from that of the chapter headings. Captions to ﬁgures should all have the same
style, but be different again from section headings and different from the main text.
All new paragraphs should begin with the same indentation (except for the ﬁrst
paragraph after a heading, which may have no indent at all), and so on. All this will
help your readers to navigate their way through your thesis. This styling is managed
by templates, which govern the appearance and numbering of every element of a
document. In my view, templates are the single most important feature of a word
processor, and you must learn how to use them properly.
After creating a style and template, you can generate a thesis structure, with a
few empty chapters and perhaps some subheadings and so on. You can then use
the style to generate a table of contents, and begin to get a sense of how the ﬁnal
thesis will appear. As you proceed, you will use the table of contents, or other out-
line tools, to get a sense of the current structure of the thesis and where it may
need revision—extra chapters, moving of material from one section to another,
changing how headings relate to each other in the hierarchy, and so on.
Writing Style
Take the time to write well. Readers make negative judgments about the ability of
authors whose writing is sloppy, incoherent, or difﬁcult to follow.
There are many books that discuss writing style, and I suggest that you read
some of them. Writing well is not about adhering to an arbitrary set of rules just
21
Writing Style

for the sake of it; it is about the messages you send to your readers. Writing that
is full of mistakes says that the author is lazy or incompetent; such people don’t
do solid research. Writing that is impenetrably complex or knotted up says that
the author is incapable of clear thinking. It is these kinds of messages that you
are trying to avoid. Remind yourself that good researchers are busy; if you want
other people to read and appreciate your work, you have to make it easy for
them to do so.
Tone matters, too. Writing that is arrogant, defensive, too formal, or too infor-
mal does not create a positive impression. I appreciate a thesis that is written in a
way that is easy to read, and where the concepts and arguments are presented in
much the same words as would be used in a meeting with friends. You need to be
precise, but neither patronizing nor pompous.
Storage and Backups
Be sure that you are systematic in your naming, storage, and backup of
documents.
As you write your thesis, you will create draft after draft, and may have the work
spread across many ﬁles. Some of these will contain the thesis itself, or fragments
of it, but there will also be ﬁles containing data, images, and so on. Many students
fail to anticipate how quickly these ﬁles will multiply, and how easy it is to lose
track of where each part is kept. Once the ﬁles become disorganized, backup
becomes more difﬁcult, and without it there is a real chance of disaster. I’ve had
more than one student who lost everything because all the work was kept on a
laptop that crashed, despite being warned about the need to make copies of every-
thing. It is crucial that you develop a system for how you name ﬁles, store them,
and back them up—and stick to it.
Let’s start with ﬁle naming. As I work, I make sure that I am using a directory
(folder) that consists of the current or most up-to-date version of every ﬁle. I make
sure that every ﬁle name is descriptive, and includes the date in some way. For
example, Chapter 3 might be kept in ‘chp_03_2014-02-11.docx’, while a ﬁle of
data harvested from the website <www.worldofwriting.com> might be in ‘world-
ofwriting-partial-2014-02-25.csv’. Because this directory is going to get copied
many times, I put large ﬁles that don’t change much (such as collections of
images) in a separate directory.
If a document is long, I break it into smaller ﬁles—maybe one per chapter.
A common disaster is for a document to become corrupt in some way; having
the chapters separate limits the possible scope of damage. For the same reason,
I frequently save documents as I work, and don’t let an hour pass without copy-
ing the document. I usually edit to a backup such as a USB key or a ﬁle server.
At the start of each day, I make a copy of the whole directory, and put the date
in the name of the copy. I can then continue to work in the ‘master’ directory.
22
2
Getting Organized

The point here is that you should always have up-to-date backups, and be able to
ﬁnd previous versions easily. This also helps you monitor progress.
At the end of every writing session, I store and backup my work in three ways.
First, I leave a copy on the local hard disk at the computer that I’m working on.
Second, I send a copy to myself through one of my email accounts. Third, I place
the ﬁle on a remote server. This may seem like a nuisance, but it ensures that my
work is safe even if the computer crashes. The fact is that everyone who works at
a computer will one day have the experience of losing work due to an electronic
failure of one kind or another; if you have been careful in how you manage your
ﬁles, the impact of the loss will be small.
Health and Wellbeing
Maintain your health by setting up an ergonomic workstation, and balancing
study with exercise and relaxation.
Take your physical limits seriously. Working intensely on a single project for an
extended period can be physically challenging. Set up your workstation properly:
put the screen at a height where you don’t strain your neck or eyes, and make sure
that your arms and hands are relaxed at the keyboard and that you work the mouse
appropriately. Footrests, back supports, and so on, are inexpensive; try them out if
you ﬁnd out that you are getting uncomfortable.
Don’t plan to do all your work at the kitchen table—as you proceed towards
the ﬁnal write-up, you will spend long hours in front of the computer, and it is all
too easy to injure yourself if the working conditions are uncomfortable.
At my workstation, I keep water handy, but I limit the coffee because I have
found that it makes me irritable and dehydrated. Also, I don’t eat at my worksta-
tion—when I’m at the computer, I work. Get up and walk around the room (or
down the street) for a few minutes every hour. Be sure also to look away from the
screen at regular intervals to give your eyes a rest.
I have found over the years that regular exercise helps me to work effec-
tively. You need another activity to get you away from the computer and to
stop you from thinking about work all the time. Sometimes I take a short
walk, or even a bike ride. It may seem strange that, in this book on thesis
writing, I am recommending that you stop work every now and again, but
believe me: breaks make you more productive. After a few hours of writing,
most people ﬁnd that they slow down; I ﬁnd that I ‘run out of words’.
After an exercise break, the words come again, sometimes more quickly than
I can type them. And I feel much more rested after a walk than after a break
on the couch—if you are getting tired, then by all means sleep, but get exer-
cise too.
Also, it’s important to spend time with friends. Again, it may seem strange
to remind you of this, but I have found that being with friends generally adds
23
Health and Wellbeing

to my overall productivity and happiness. Of course you should return to your
minor thesis feeling refreshed, not exhausted: you won’t work well after a long
night of partying. Stay on track, of course, but be sure to plan for time away
from the thesis.

Chapter 3
The Structure of a Thesis
Although the focus and content of theses differ greatly, they all share a common
recognizable, and appropriate, structure. Examiners expect a thesis writer to moti-
vate the work, present background material, and conduct an investigation. Results
must be well argued and displayed, and the thesis has to end with a sound conclu-
sion. This standard structure works well for theses in the physical, biomedical,
mathematical, and social sciences. Although theses that are produced in the huma-
nities often differ from those in the sciences, they too follow structures that are
both familiar and appropriate to their disciplines. In this chapter, we explain
how a minor thesis is structured, and highlight how important it is to maintain a
consistent narrative and style throughout your entire manuscript.
The ‘Standard’ Thesis Structure
Be familiar with the common parts of a thesis, and how they ﬁt with each other.
The standard thesis structure has four parts: an introduction, the background, the core
(for want of a better word), and a synthesis. Each of these parts has a distinct role.
• The introduction has the purpose of introducing the overall study and creating
interest in the work. Simply, it explains what the thesis is about: the context
and motivation of the problem, the aim and scope, a snapshot of the approach,
and an overview of what lies ahead. In some disciplines, an introduction may
include a brief example, key terms, or an overview of the ﬁndings. For a minor
thesis, three to ﬁve pages is ample.
• A background section is needed to provide the examiner and other readers with
sufﬁcient knowledge to situate and understand your work. It contains a review
of the literature that sets out the relevant history and context of the problem,
current perspectives on the problem, central aspects of theory and practice,
25

P. Gruba, J. Zobel, How To Write Your First Thesis, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-61854-8_3

competing solutions, reﬂections on methodology, and the issues and debates
that may arise in regard to other researchers’ views.
• The core section consists of your own propositions or hypotheses, innovations,
experimental designs, surveys, results, analysis, and so on. It contains your ori-
ginal contribution and often forms the bulk of a thesis.
• A synthesis draws together your contribution to the topic. It contains a discus-
sion in which you critically examine your own results, and is where you pro-
duce conclusions. In the light of the background section, it is here that you
make judgments as to what has been learnt in your work. A good synthesis
responds directly to the aim of the work as stated in the introduction.
Ensure that each of these components is progressively developed as your writing
proceeds. A strong thesis is the product of considered work, where there has been
opportunity to debate, revise, and evaluate each chapter. An impressive thesis struc-
ture is the result of the tight integration of the four components, and it is most easily
achieved if they are written to form a logically coherent, extended argument.
Of the four components, it is the structure of the core that varies most across
the disciplines. Consider how work to do with languages could be structured. In
one thesis, for example, the ﬁrst sections of the core chapters may be descriptions
of a survey tool, and an explanation of how it is linked to an investigation of lan-
guage use in online communities; in another thesis, the core may consist of statis-
tical analyses and presentation of the results. In another example thesis, the ﬁrst
core section might sketch how it is plausible that language-use learnt from web
data can be used as a mechanism for automatic checking of grammar; the next sec-
tion might propose an initial method for inferring some interesting forms of
language-use and applying them to a new document. A common factor in core
sections of theses is that they are narratives that lead the reader from a proposition
to an outcome, linked by evidence and argument.
Your supervisor can provide you with theses from previous students. Read them,
as they can be excellent guides to what you are trying to accomplish. With a past the-
sis in hand, see if the table of contents gives you a clear idea of the structure of the
work as a whole. Then browse the introduction and conclusions, and look through
the reference section. Next, read the introduction carefully and compare it to the con-
clusions to see if the work is linked in a coherent manner. Look especially for speciﬁc
formatting and conventions: How are particular words spelled? What is the best way
to display data? What is the typical length of a chapter? You may be impressed with
the virtues of some theses, such as professional layouts, innovative displays of com-
plex material in graphs or tables, or a strong integration of online materials. Stay alert
for the points that impress you, and make a note to adapt them for your own work.
Creating a Non-standard Thesis Structure
Read and learn from other theses in your area to avoid having to invent structures
for yourself, and to align with the approaches and expectations that are accepted
by examiners in your discipline.
26
3
The Structure of a Thesis

If you are writing a thesis that relies on a non-standard structure—or are writing
a thesis where the approach and problem might, in traditional terms, be ‘interdisci-
plinary’—don’t make the mistake of trying to reinvent the form of the thesis from
scratch. Take the time to ﬁnd other theses that have pursued similar problems in a
similar way; read these theses, and others, to help yourself decide how your work
should be organized and presented. Make sure you are familiar with the methods
of both qualitative and quantitative research; there are many excellent books on
these topics, some written for speciﬁc disciplines but applicable to a broad audi-
ence, such as the books on statistical research methods for psychology. And it is
essential that you establish a clear line of argument.
Perhaps surprisingly, you could base your early efforts on a standard structure.
To do this, ﬁrst write a draft of your introductory chapter—the problem statement,
the aim and scope, and the steps you think you might take to achieve the aim.
You may not feel conﬁdent about writing this introduction because you suspect
that it will have to be modiﬁed later. Your suspicion is almost certainly correct,
but that should not prevent you from writing a draft introduction. What you are
trying to do is to get started. A rough structure may be a piece of ﬂowing text, or
a series of bullet points that capture essential content.
If you haven’t done so already, ﬁnd several theses in your broad area and have
a careful look at their tables of contents. Some will be good, others poor. With the
departmental assessment criteria in hand, take the time to analyze them, focusing
on their structure. Take notes of what you liked and didn’t like about various fea-
tures. Think creatively about how you will avoid pitfalls and highlight strengths as
you develop your own thesis.
Narrative
Use signposts and commentary to guide the reader through your thesis.
One way to think of the role of structure, and signposting, is as a guide that walks
readers along a road from what they already know (past knowledge) to what they
should know (a knowledge frontier).
When you write a thesis, it can be helpful to reﬂect on what you knew—and
how you thought—when you began your work. In a way, this earlier ‘you’ is the
person you are writing for. The story, or narrative, that takes the reader along the
road should be as straightforward as you can make it. You may think that you need
to tell everyone that you had to fumble, and explore, and make mistakes to get the
results and produce a thesis. Move past such thinking, and view the purpose of
your work as setting out a clear path, free of barriers, that helps the next person to
come to the same point of view and the same knowledge without fumbling.
A key element to good writing is to clearly understand what the writing is meant to
achieve. In my view, the twin concepts of narrative and audience—what are you trying
to say, and who you are saying it to—are the most important concepts a writer can learn.
A clear narrative assists readers to develop their own understanding as they
read the thesis; the structure is how the material is organized to create a narrative.
27
Narrative

Different structures may be appropriate in different disciplines, notably the con-
trasts between the humanities and the sciences. For example, some theses might
emphasize quantitative work, where the contribution rests on experimental tests of
theories or innovations with measurable outcomes; others emphasize qualitative
work, with discussion and argument based on documentary sources and other
researchers’ interpretations of records of events. Still others theses may explore
the text of a major literary work, or seek to critique a political stance. Each of
these, regardless of structure, needs to guide readers through a narrative.
Who reads minor theses? Who is your audience? Quite simply, most academic
research is read by academics. Your examiners will probably be staff in your depart-
ment or school, and, although you may have worked with them earlier as teachers or
lecturers, they will examine your work in their roles as researchers. At this point, their
goal is not to educate you, but rather to provide the department with a single score
and brief summary report. When I examine theses, I set aside my pedagogical role.
My job is not to give advice to improve the thesis—that was done by one of my
colleagues, your supervisor—but to provide a score. I calibrate my score against the
departmental minor thesis assessment guidelines, and then write up a brief explana-
tion to defend my own assessment. I then prepare to discuss my score, and perhaps
negotiate an adjustment, at a departmental meeting. In brief, your audience is a busy
academic who, when reading your thesis, focuses on the role of an objective
researcher with the aim of assigning a grade with respect to ofﬁcial criteria.
Initial Efforts
Decide where you are going to begin your writing; this is likely to be the litera-
ture review or part of the core.
Once you have sketched a structure, your next task is to decide which chapter or
section you could tackle ﬁrst, and start writing. Many students ﬁnd it easiest to
start with a factual or concrete chapter, rather than attempt to write material that
requires careful argument or complex interpretations or judgments. In a technical
area, for example, this chapter might be a description of an experimental design,
or a presentation of a series of initial results.
Another model, which works well when you are able to develop a clear structure
right from the start, involves writing fragments from around the thesis. For example,
in a thesis on the changing vocabulary of social media postings, you can simulta-
neously be working on the parts of the background concerning language adaptabil-
ity, documenting the experimental environment, explaining how ‘real world’ data is
obtained from social media websites, and exploring ways of presenting your initial
experimental results. This way, if one task is stalled—or is leading to excessive
procrastination—you can switch to another and continue to be productive.
In the early stages of your ﬁrst thesis, you are probably not quite ready to write
a critical review of the literature. To get you started, though, I suggest that you
28
3
The Structure of a Thesis

start to review key concepts and terms. From experience, ‘the literature’ is not a
solid, monolithic entity, but rather a ﬂuid conversation in a community of scholars.
At times, that conversation gets noisy and heated, and deﬁnitions and concepts are
robustly discussed. One task in entering this community, then, may be to deter-
mine which variation of a concept you would like to adopt for your own work.
When you have read the literature and written about such issues, you will be far
better informed about your project. Indeed, you may need to revise your aim, and
perhaps trim the scope of your study. At this point you will certainly be in a much
better position to, for example, devise questions for a survey, or to examine the
nuances of a particular phenomenon. The writing will not be wasted, as much of it
will end up in the ﬁnal draft of your thesis.
Thinking your way into the project like this will help you to write a tentative
structure for the ﬁrst part of your thesis. There will probably be a big blank in the
ﬁnal chapter or two, but you at least have enough material to draw up a tentative
table of contents.
In my experience, a strong obstacle for some students at this stage is fear of
making a false start and thus wasting time. However, any productive work on a
minor thesis is time well spent: it helps you come to grips with the literature, gain
experience with tools, and learn to write as a researcher. Moreover, it can be difﬁ-
cult to establish a clear line of research without writing about it—for example, it
may well be that the exercise of creating an initial thesis is how you learn that the
topic needs to be changed.
Once you start the writing itself, allow the creative side of your brain to work
through the argument for you. When you have ﬁnished writing for the day, sleep on
it (the existence of this expression is evidence that our unconscious thought processes
keep working even when all rational thinking has been switched off). Your ﬁrst task
the next day is to look at the chapter outline, then read the chapter as it stands.
Print your thesis out occasionally, so that you have a hard copy to make notes
on; put it in a folder with printouts of any other chapters you have drafted. Every
time you go to a meeting with your supervisor, take the folder with you. It is the
latest draft of your thesis.
Beginning an Individual Chapter
To get started on a chapter, set out the signposts to begin a narrative for the
reader.
Just as the entire thesis must be properly structured to ensure that the examiner
is guided through the narrative, so must individual chapters. Why is each chapter
there? What is its function in the thesis? You must make this absolutely clear. The
best way to ensure clarity is to write a formal introduction to every chapter.
Follow with the business of the chapter itself, then a formal conclusion. By a for-
mal introduction, I mean a piece of text that is designed to explain the role the
29
Beginning an Individual Chapter

chapter plays in the thesis. A typical such introduction is organized into three brief
paragraphs:
• First paragraph. Create a link back to the earlier parts of the thesis, in particu-
lar the previous chapter, to make it obvious why the chapter is needed.
• Second paragraph. State the aim of the chapter, what the reader should learn
from it and how it advances the overall goal.
• Third paragraph. Outline how you intend to achieve this aim. This paragraph
may have the ‘overview of contents’ ﬂavour that so many writers think consti-
tutes an introduction, but it is only one part of the introduction. Without the
other two parts, the reader struggles for a sense of direction. (Avoid presenting
this as a table of contents, which is far from helpful. The reader needs to know
not only what will be dealt with in the chapter, but also the logical connections
between the various sections.)
After the introduction comes the main body of the chapter. Its contents and
structure will depend on the kind of chapter you are writing and the kind of
research you are reporting. Nevertheless, it needs to ﬂow logically from the pur-
pose of the chapter, as stated in its introduction, to its summary or conclusions.
This typically involves three or four major sections. Having too many sections in
a chapter makes the structure difﬁcult for the reader to follow. If you ﬁnd that you
have created a lot of sections, then you need to step back and ask if the structure
is still appropriate.
Study or Case Study?
Your research will focus on a phenomenon in its own right (a study) or be investi-
gated as an example to see how principles work when they are applied (a case study).
The structure of a chapter, as well as guiding both writer and reader, reinforces the
key aim of your work; it is a framework for the argument.
A problem can be investigated in its own right or be used as an example for a
range of similar problems. To illustrate, consider an investigation of the ways that
Indonesian television news broadcasts are understood by learners of the
Indonesian language. In this investigation, there is a clear focus on Indonesia as a
study. One implication of such a study, then, would be to develop better language
teaching materials based on television programs for learners of Indonesian.
Alternatively, we might investigate the understanding of Indonesian television
news by language learners as a case study to determine how advanced learners
of any foreign language make sense of television programs. In this example,
there are many types of television news programs across the world, and there are
many millions of people who may learn a language from watching such programs.
What factors, though, inﬂuence their comprehension of the news? Here, we are
30
3
The Structure of a Thesis

investigating only those wanting to learn from Indonesian programs, but the impli-
cations of such a study are written so that they apply to the learning of any foreign
language through television. The implications of the case study could be trans-
ferred to investigations of the understanding of television in China, Senegal, or
Canada. The intent of the thesis was to come up with broadly applicable results,
for which the Indonesian study served as an initial example.
As you can see, despite the similarity of the subjects in the two research pro-
jects, the structure of the thesis depends, in part, on your purpose and ﬁnal goal.
From the start, then, you need to be clear about whether you are investigating a
phenomenon in its own right or as a case study from which you might later
develop principles that apply to similar settings. The decision to pursue either a
study or a case study design fundamentally affects the introduction and aim of
your thesis, the focus of your literature review, and the areas of implications for
your work.
Anouck (introduced in the Preface) was struck by the range and type of bilin-
gual advertising in areas of Melbourne. In brief, as Melbourne has become
increasingly multicultural over the last several decades, advertisers have done their
best to promote their goods and services in a range of languages. In some suburbs
of Melbourne, a great deal of the advertising signage is bilingual. Anouck was
interested in how bilingual advertising was perceived by monolingual residents (in
this case, those who spoke only English). What did they think of the signage in
other languages on neighbourhood shopping streets?
At the start of our supervisory meetings, many of our discussions sought to
determine whether Anouck was intending to write a study or a case study. We out-
lined the two structures and discussed them, ﬁrst considering how the differences
affected her intended work.
Comparison of a study and a case study
A study: The primary purpose is to examine a
particular phenomenon or site of study,
leading to the development of implications
that relate directly to the speciﬁc concerns
raised within that context.
A case study: The central purpose is to
investigate a phenomenon or site of study as a
single example of a broader set of related
examples, leading to the development of
broadly applicable ﬁndings that can be used
across a range of similar contexts.
Title: Attitudes towards bilingual advertising
signs on the streets of Melbourne.
Title: Perceptions of bilingual advertising:
A case study of Melbourne street signs
Context of the study: As a result of
globalization, bilingual advertising signage is
increasing in Melbourne.
Context of the study: As a result of
globalization, there is an increasing amount of
bilingual advertising in major cities.
Motivation: Although Melbourne is known
as a tolerant and multicultural city, little work
to date has investigated how bilingual
advertising signs are perceived in the city.
Motivation: Despite a rise of differing
languages in urban spaces, little research to
date has examined the role of bilingual
advertising signage in relation to tolerant
attitudes in global cities.

Study or Case Study?

Be clear about which of the two approaches you are using. If you are unde-
cided, your background, core, and synthesis sections will be confused and
muddled. Why? If you are conducting a study, your review of the literature should
focus on the speciﬁc phenomenon or site; in a case study, your review of literature
would concern a much wider view of previous work. In a study, your core section
shows evidence related to the speciﬁc phenomenon or site; in a case study, analy-
sis exempliﬁes how general characteristics are present. Finally, the synthesis of a
study relates only to the speciﬁc phenomenon or site; in a case study, the synthesis
seeks to make broader claims to a wider set of related phenomena or sites.
Which one of the thesis designs should you use? For a minor thesis, I would advise
you to conduct a study: by investigating a speciﬁc phenomenon or site, your work has
deﬁned limits and you are likely to complete it within the tight time and resource
constraints. A case study, on the other hand, has the potential challenge of throwing
up a wide range of sites, phenomena, and other possibilities that may take some effort
to constrain, both conceptually and practically. Thus, a study is a more suitable
approach for a minor thesis, and a case study is better suited to senior research degrees
and projects. Of course, such choices can be highly discipline-speciﬁc.
Observation or Innovation?
A technical investigation can focus on observing and quantifying existing beha-
viour, or on demonstrating the properties of an innovation.
Many research topics concern the study of speciﬁc phenomena in one form or
another: for example, the effectiveness of an innovative teaching approach; the
extent of use of video games as recreation by the elderly; the invasion of unwanted
plant species in farming districts; the performance of underwater microphones.
(continued)
Aim and scope: To examine the perception
of bilingual advertising signs in Melbourne.
Limit the scope of study to focus only on a
speciﬁc area of the Melbourne, and survey
(for example) only the monolingual
English-speaking long-term residents of the
area advertising in global cities.
Aim and scope: To examine the perception
of bilingual advertising in global cities.
Limit the initial scope to Melbourne, with
a proviso that one area will be used to
represent the entire city, and survey
(for example) only the monolingual
English-speaking long-term residents
of the area.
Approach: Specify that one particular area of
Melbourne is the focus of the in-depth
investigation, and strive to determine and
understand the unique characteristics of that
area that may inﬂuence resident attitudes to
bilingualism.
Approach: Select and justify Melbourne as
an appropriate site of study; because it meets
the deﬁnition of ‘global city’, the results of
the study may be broadly applicable to similar
global cities.

The Structure of a Thesis

These topics can be seen as based on observation, in that they propose descriptions
of observed phenomena and then proceed to evaluate whether the descriptions are
valid. In such a topic, the description is, or forms part of, the hypothesis.
Other research topics concern construction or invention: a technique for infer-
ring grammar, an energy accountancy method, a health message design, a new
microphone technology. These topics can be seen as based on innovation, in that
they involve creation of something new as well as evaluation of it. The description
of the innovation may, in some cases, consume a substantial proportion of the the-
sis, and most of the core. There also needs to be a discussion of the properties that
the innovation is expected to have (that is, what it is predicted to do) and of cri-
teria that it is intended to meet. Together, these components form a hypothesis,
but one that is very different in form from that in an observational thesis.
Other topics are neither one nor the other, such as a model that links weather
conditions to likely road trafﬁc. A model is by its nature descriptive (a form of
structured observation), but may involve innovative mathematical constructs. Indeed,
it is a simpliﬁcation to regard any topic as purely observational or innovative—no
topic is truly at these extremes—but, as a handy simpliﬁcation, it helps us to
understand how the purpose of an investigation inﬂuences the structure of a thesis.
Organization
Be conscious of your choices in structure, and, in particular, of the overall ﬂow of
the argument.
So where do these lines of discussion take you in terms of how to organize the
central chapters of your thesis? As I noted earlier, practice varies a great deal
between disciplines, and you need to read other theses in your area—and get
advice from your supervisor—to establish how your thesis should be arranged.
For some topics the core is quite brief, with a focus on statement of a hypothesis
and an explanation of how data was collected in the process of evaluating the
hypothesis. For other topics, the core extends over two or more extensive chapters,
which will contain descriptions of an innovation, a discussion of what is involved
in practical deployment of the innovation, explanation of criteria that the innova-
tion needs to meet, and a description of the experiments that have been used to
evaluate the innovation. The practice of your discipline is the best guide, and if
you have sought out other theses, you will undoubtedly have found good exam-
ples to use as models.
While I cannot give you guidance that is speciﬁc to your discipline, I can give
you advice on the criteria that the core part of the thesis needs to satisfy. The
term is overused, but let me again say ‘narrative’. You are leading the reader
through your thinking, and need to do so in a way that lets the reader see that
your hypotheses and methods are reasonable and appropriate. You need to
explain why your proposals are plausible, and, at least subtly, persuade the reader
33
Organization

of the strength of these compared to other perspectives or approaches. Each
project will be different.
• For an observation-based thesis, this may ﬂow directly from the background
material; for an innovation-based thesis, this may involve building a case to
support the claim that your new approach solves problems that previous
approaches neglected.
• For a study, you need to persuade the reader that the subject is of sufﬁcient
interest; for a case study, you need to persuade the reader that the subject is
representative of a broader population or phenomenon.
• A quantitative thesis may need sections, or a whole chapter, on experimental
design and data collection.
A common feature, though, is that the reader has been made aware of which
method you used and why you chose it. Before you describe the results obtained
by using this method, you must ﬁrst describe in detail the way that you applied the
method, and why. Although projects may use quite different approaches, the issues
to be dealt with are similar: clear identiﬁcation of questions and hypotheses; expli-
cit choice of method and tools; design of research instruments; and so on.
Plagiarism and Research Integrity
Your thesis must be your own. Other people’s text and ideas cannot be incorpo-
rated unless they are fully and unambiguously acknowledged.
Plagiarism, or the unacknowledged use of material, is a fundamental issue of
academic honesty. Suspected instances of plagiarism can provoke strong
responses. An underlying cause is that the reputations of scholars are based on
what they have produced and written; in the academic community that you are
seeking to enter, the unacknowledged use of other scholars’ words is perceived as
a particularly threatening form of theft. Copying is a violation of community
norms. Such actions have a particular signiﬁcance in the context of a thesis
because it is an initial point of entry into the academic community, and allegations
of misconduct can severely damage a professional reputation.
Some students argue that ‘just a little’ copying is acceptable. But charges of
plagiarism may be based on the unacknowledged use of much less than a section
of a chapter; 100 or 200 words of direct copying would be regarded as a breach of
ethical standards, and it would be sufﬁcient to trigger some form of disciplinary
proceedings. It does not matter whether the original material was in an academic
paper or a web page; it is not the source of the work that is being considered, but
whether it has been copied. Unless clearly attributed and put into quote marks,
each and every word in your thesis should be your own.
Other forms of academic misconduct are, likewise, of concern. These include,
but are not limited to, falsiﬁcation or misuse of data, unethical practices, and
34
3
The Structure of a Thesis

presenting as your own work any material that was produced in collaboration with
others. Take the time to read about academic misconduct at your university; most
institutions have guidelines and regulations on this topic. If you have any ques-
tions about what is and is not acceptable, talk to a senior academic that you trust,
such as your supervisor or thesis coordinator.
In a related question, how much should you ask—or even pay for—someone to
edit your own writing? The short answer is nothing: ideally, each word in your
thesis should be yours alone. A university writing-support unit may provide assis-
tance; in such sessions, support staff will ask you to reﬂect on what you have writ-
ten, ask you if you can self-identity tangled prose and faulty grammar, and
suggest some strategies and materials to help you to improve your work. The task
of editing your work, ﬁxing up faulty structure, and so on, is yours, not one for
your supervisor or a consultant.
35
Plagiarism and Research Integrity

Chapter 4
A Strong Beginning: The Introduction
Your initial chapter is crucial: it must concisely situate your study, motivate and
focus it, and provide an indication of your approach and where the work is going.
The initial chapter also has another purpose: to introduce you to the examiner.
Imagine, for a moment, that your thesis is an interesting person you are meeting for
the ﬁrst time. Think of the questions that you might ask: Where are you from? What
are you doing here? What kind of work do you do? What have you done so far?
Where are you going? Take the time to write the introduction properly, and revise it
on a regular basis as your research project develops. You want the examiner to think
highly of you; the introduction is where all-important ﬁrst impressions will be formed.
In this chapter, I identify the elements that the introduction should contain, but
that doesn’t mean that it should be a series of headings with a paragraph or two of
text under each. A strong introduction is a single, ﬂowing piece of text that talks
to the reader in an engaging way; frequent headings can turn interesting text into a
series of dull pronouncements.
Context of the Study
Introduce the reader to the area of work by explaining the context or environment
in which the problem arises.
To establish a relationship with your examiner, and provide background to your
problem, argument, and outcomes, you need to provide some context for your
study. Contexts may, for example, be historical, geographical, situational, or
theoretical (or perhaps a combination of such perspectives). Situate your thesis
historically, by telling the examiner approximately how long the area of study has
existed, or how the area arose; you can note the major studies that ﬁrst recognized
the issue at hand. If your study requires a sense of location, you can brieﬂy intro-
duce where the study is located geographically.
37

An alternative to a geographical location is a situational location, such as the factors
that give rise to the question. Mickey’s situational context was search technology as it
is applied to web data, and the fact that web search is intended for general-purpose
use; the same search engines are used across the same set of web pages (the whole
web, more or less), regardless of what kind of information is being searched for.
Introducing a theoretical framework is a more abstract undertaking. To make such
an introduction engaging, imagine that you’re trying to situate your study or approach
in the larger landscape of the entire research ﬁeld. Locate yourself in relation to some
of the major thinkers in your ﬁeld or among major current trends in your area.
By providing a context you are explaining the perspective from which you will
approach the problem. If your interest is in household purchasing choices, for
example, then this needs to be made clear; the problems that arise in this context
will depend on whether your interest is in search technology, bilingualism, pov-
erty, social strata, advertising, psychology, or some other ﬁeld. All of these can be
applied to purchasing choices, but in very different ways.
Motivation for the Study
State the reason for the study: What problem does it seek to address?
A deﬁning element of a research project is that it should accomplish something.
Readers of a minor thesis should have their understanding advanced in some inter-
esting way. A key task of the introduction is explain what that advance was in a
way that persuades the reader that the work was worth undertaking.
Brainstorming is important in developing a thesis. To give a project this sense of
purpose, I suggest that you write out at least three reasons why your study is
required. When I work with my students, I ask them to write down as many ideas
as they can about their topic. I do this for two reasons: I get an idea of the areas
they’re interested in, and ensure that when they do select a topic it is the one that
they truly want to do. As we begin to brainstorm, I ask a series of simple questions:
Who might be affected by the work? What is affected by the work? Will it cause
something to grow or to diminish? Who stands to lose or to beneﬁt by any resulting
changes to current beliefs or knowledge? What changes in practice might result?
What assumptions must be made for the research outcomes to be applicable?
When advising Anouck on her study of bilingual advertising, we came up with
several motivations for the work: the world is becoming more global, and varia-
tion in language use is part of globalization; earlier research on bilingual advertis-
ing has focused on magazines, not urban streets; the prominence of, and attitudes
towards, increased bilingualism in the community; and so on. Mickey and I, like-
wise, found several motivations: search of ﬁction had almost no prior research;
stylistic markers have been used for applications such as identifying the author of
a work, but have not been used to link to readership; it would help test the gener-
ality of methods developed for analysis of blogs and newspaper articles; and
others. For these students, clear ideas of what motivated both the interest in and
the need for their work helped them to direct the rest of their projects.
38
4
A Strong Beginning: The Introduction

Aim and Scope
With reference to the motivation, state in a single sentence the purpose of the
study. Identify the anticipated limitations of the project in terms of factors such as
location, framework, application, completeness, or participants.
The aim, or purpose, of a project has three characteristics: it responds directly to
the motivation, it is singular—that is, it concerns a single goal and activity—and it
suggests the project’s title.
First, a well-stated aim should provide clear purpose and direction, and it can
only do so if it responds directly to the motivation. Second, having a singular aim
ensures that the thesis will be coherent. For me, it shows that the student is not
over-promising and has a clear grasp of the project at hand. If your aim has multi-
ple parts, then you run the risk of creating a monster stitched together from unre-
lated components. For example, Mickey wanted to develop statistical methods for
categorizing pieces of ﬁction and then design search technology to use these statis-
tical methods. Both of these are signiﬁcant problems and it would not be possible
to address them in a single minor thesis. To avoid the perception that you are
over-promising, you can designate one as the primary aim, and present the other
as a secondary aim if you believe that it will follow naturally and easily from the
ﬁrst. It would be better, though, to discard the secondary aim unless the primary
aim is meaningless without it.
Third, if a thesis aim is such that it can be directly reﬂected in the title of the
thesis, then a clear link is established between what is expected and what is
delivered. The title is usually the ﬁrst thing I read in a thesis and it sets the tone
and raises expectations about the entire work. Having a mismatch between
the title of the work and the purpose of a work is a waste of time for everyone
involved. Establishing the scope of the thesis helps to manage examiner expec-
tations, and to clarify what can be accomplished with limited resources and
within the deadline.
I urge my students to identify three to ﬁve limits to their work. Your work, for
example, can be constrained by the amount of time that is available, the complex-
ity of the lab work or software development to be undertaken, the kinds of areas
or applications to which the outcomes will be relevant, the amount and type of
data that is available, or the location of the study. It can also be constrained by the
theoretical framework, or by the target of the inquiry. Your supervisor can work
with you to establish a scope to help ensure that you do not overestimate your
abilities, and to conﬁrm that the work can plausibly be completed on time with the
available resources.
For a minor thesis student, setting a scope is much more than an idle exercise
because it teaches the basic relationship between research effort and reward; the
scope can be seen as a contract between you and your supervisor as you learn to
establish boundaries. At times, when I am discussing with my students what was
expected and what was delivered, I draw their attention to the scope we set at the
beginning of the project before we discuss milestones and delays. In this way, the
scope helps us to maintain an effective working relationship.
39
Aim and Scope

Research Questions
With reference to the problem and aims, state the emphases of the study in the
form of questions, perhaps even just a single question.
You will have developed your questions early in the process of undertaking the
project, and now you need to articulate them in a precise way. The questions are
not the same as the aim; Mickey’s aim was to develop methods for online search
among pieces of ﬁction, while his questions concerned whether statistical proper-
ties of text could be linked to reader preferences. For Anouck, her aim was to
examine bilingual signage in urban spaces, but her questions were focused on the
role of attitudes among residents. A strong thesis will often rest on just a single
question, but, to provide highly speciﬁc direction to the work, it may instead be
appropriate to use two or three related questions that suggest a thread of activity.
Approach and Outcomes
Brieﬂy provide an overview of the methodology of the project, how the outcomes
were achieved, and what they were.
From the start, you need to know whether you are investigating a phenomenon
in a speciﬁc context, or using the phenomenon as an example of more widespread
issues and concerns; this is the ‘study versus case study’ question I discussed in
Chap. 3. You also need to know if your work will be quantitative or qualitative;
observational or inventive; based on existing tools or on tools developed for the
project; and so on. I urge you to ‘locate yourself’ by mapping out the various char-
acteristics of your approach. Anouck, for example, saw herself as a qualitative
researcher conducting an observational study through the use of an established fra-
mework for linguistic and attitudinal analyses. By situating her study as such, and
understanding her choices, she was less vulnerable to the temptation to make
changes, or to endlessly reconsider choices, as I’ve seen some students do.
Critically, you need to know how the outcomes will be measured and assessed,
and you need to know what constitutes a positive outcome. This issue, and ques-
tions such as whether it is a study or case study, determine what data you need
and what activities you undertake.
Later, you will set out your approach, data, and so on, in the appropriate chapter
of your thesis. At this point, you need to give the examiner a general overview, which
would usually occupy no more than a page or so—but not all of the detail, or a lot of
detail presented too compactly. The introduction is where the ideas are sketched out,
and can be absorbed in an informal or intuitive way; the detail is ﬁlled in by the body
of the thesis. An examiner who has read your introduction should be able to open the
thesis at any point and quickly grasp the broad thrust of what is being discussed.
40
4
A Strong Beginning: The Introduction

A thesis is not a story that unfolds slowly like a crime novel, designed to keep the
reader in suspense; thus the results should not be kept as a surprise for the examiner,
tucked into the last few pages, but should be clearly ﬂagged in the opening chapter.
I have examined several frustrating theses in which I could not identify what the stu-
dent claimed to have accomplished! Make sure that the examiner understands, right
from the start, the purpose of your thesis and where it is heading.
Overview
Provide a brief summary of what is to follow, chapter by chapter.
An overview can consist of about 8–10 sentences in a single paragraph, and is
often used to wrap up the introduction. It is used to succinctly indicate to the
examiner what lies ahead, in terms of the structure of the thesis. If you like, it is a
sketch of the learning the examiner must go through in order to appreciate your
project and its outcomes. It states what is explained where, and in what order, and
it can be thought of as answering a series of questions. Where is background lit-
erature discussed, and from what areas? Where is the data introduced and
explained? Where is the methodology, and on what principles does it rest? Where
are the experiments, and how comprehensive are they? With this brief guide to the
work in hand, the examiner can quickly proceed to the body of the thesis.

Overview

Chapter 5
Situating the Study: The Background
For research to be of value, it must in some way extend, reﬁne, or rebut current
knowledge. The background of your thesis is where you fully explain the context
of your study, and establish the current state of understanding in the ﬁeld. Your
task in this part of your thesis is to explain the knowledge you are building on and
the knowledge you will change, or to explain how your work relates to past
studies, current debates, and gaps in the present body of knowledge. Our purpose
in this chapter is to help you write this background.
Structure of the Background
Use your background to help the reader appreciate how your outcomes relate to
current knowledge in the ﬁeld.
Depending on the nature of your thesis, the background sections or chapters can take
any of several different forms. But their function is always the same: to provide the
context for your work and to explain your position in relation to the ﬁeld. A useful
perspective is to think of the background as educating the ‘you’ that you were at the
start of the research project. Four common elements in the background are:
• Establishment of a context to locate a study in time, situation, application, or
culture.
• Identiﬁcation of current theory, discoveries, innovations, and debates, includ-
ing an evaluation of those most useful and relevant to your topic, as well as
identiﬁcation of gaps or inconsistencies in the literature.
• Outline of current practices and technologies in your ﬁeld that highlight, and
perhaps synthesize, a selection of the appropriate methods and tools for gather-
ing data and results for your study.
• Preliminary investigations undertaken by you or others that clarify research
techniques, formulate questions and hypotheses, or focus the investigation.

Considering the work of Anouck, to investigate the perception of bilingual
advertising in an urban environment you would certainly need a descriptive sec-
tion on the key characteristics of bilingual ads. You would also have a section that
sets out current controversies that surround the bilingual advertising: Who is it
really for? What is its underlying purpose? Why do businesses use it? Next, you
would need to have a section that details ways in which previous studies on such
advertising in urban environments have been conducted. If previous work is unsa-
tisfactory in some way, for example, the questionnaires used are out of date or not
applicable to your intended participant group, then you would need to conduct a
preliminary study to clarify instruments and other aspects of methodology, includ-
ing research questions.
Considering the work of Mickey, the research goal is reasonably straightforward,
but a wide range of technologies are potentially applicable. You would need a section
on the properties of text that are relevant to methods for statistical language
processing, and an examination (perhaps based on preliminary experiments) of pro-
perties that are speciﬁc to online ﬁction. Much of the background would consist of
review and in-principle assessment of approaches to automatic text processing; a key
example might be the ‘authorship identiﬁcation’ methods that are used to estimate
who may have written an anonymous document. The background would conclude
with a review of experimental methodologies applied in similar previous work.
The background section would be the basis for the design of your project,
which can then be understood as naturally following on from prior work, and
conducted using techniques that are backed with solid justiﬁcation.
Literature
Existing knowledge is captured in academic publications, and you need to estab-
lish your own competence by demonstrating mastery of this prior work.
A great many kinds of activities go into creating a thesis. A critical one is the
search for relevant literature. What constitutes ‘relevant’ varies between disci-
plines, but in general the bulk of the citations will be to academic literature, that
is, to documents that are accepted by the community as reliable sources of knowl-
edge. These are typically refereed, widely accessible, identiﬁable, and durable.
A blog article found on the web fails most of these criteria, as does an email, even
if from an eminent authority.
The type of research you do (case study or study, for example) affects which litera-
ture you will search for and eventually read. Anouck was unsure, when she started
her study, how much scholarship was available concerning ways in which multicultur-
alism has inﬂuenced Melbourne. When students tell me that they are having difﬁculty
ﬁnding previous work in an area, I say that it may not be possible to conduct a ‘study’,
and we should now switch to a ‘case study’ and thus broaden their search terms.
Anouck had to do this for her work and was able to ﬁnd much more research about
bilingual advertising in the geographical context of other places, such as Europe.

Situating the Study: The Background

There are many sources of information besides the academic literature, includ-
ing newspaper articles, corridor conversations, resources such as Wikipedia, and
the web in general. In most cases it is appropriate to conﬁrm such knowledge in
an academic source, and it is the academic source that should be cited. To take a
wider perspective, we read for many reasons, such as to establish that our work is
novel and to identify new lines of questioning, and to set our work in an academic
context. Such reading informs us, but is not necessarily a part of the ﬁnal thesis.
Reading can sometimes be footnoted rather than listed as a formal reference.
Never forget that reading is an ongoing commitment; you should be looking for
and incorporating literature throughout your study, even when you are setting out
results, discussing your ﬁndings, and writing conclusions. Some of this will be deep
reading of key papers; some will be light reading across an area to get a sense of the
current thinking. Some will be a return to search tools to see what new work is being
published. Commit to a weekly routine of searching and reading, and stick to it. Be
sure to accurately catalogue your references so that they are readily accessible. Many
students use bibliography database software; if you are seeking a suitable tool, ask
your supervisor or consult a librarian at your university.
In a common approach to thesis writing, students are asked to produce a ‘litera-
ture review’ chapter, thorough and polished, before they are permitted to proceed
with their own work. The idea is that, informed by a literature review, students
will be able to see where previous researchers have drawn unwarranted conclu-
sions or disagreed with each other and would then be able to design incisive inves-
tigations to resolve these problems.
You certainly should read the literature before you leap into your research pro-
gram, and should also attempt to write down your understanding of it. But until
you have done some work of your own, or collected and analyzed some data, it is
not possible to be ‘critical’ in the sense implied by ‘a critical review of the litera-
ture’. It follows that you will not yet be able to design those incisive investigations
that have so far eluded the other researchers in your area. You may be able to
design a research program, but almost certainly, at this stage, it will be tentative.
Developing Critical Thinking
Throughout your thesis, seek to develop and demonstrate your critical thinking skills.
How do you convert your initial ‘literature survey’ into a critical review of
existing theory that leads logically into the work that you design and undertake
yourself? A review of current literature serves three purposes: it gives the back-
ground information required to establish the extent and signiﬁcance of your
research problem; it identiﬁes and discusses attempts by others to solve similar
problems; and it provides examples of methods they have used in attempts to get
these solutions. Make sure you deal with all of these. It is likely (and expected)
that you will have read much more widely in the topic area than you need for
your review. Your initial journey through the literature will help you to gain a
45
Developing Critical Thinking

better understanding of your central problem, but you do not need not to write
about every paper in full. Keep in mind the aim and scope of your thesis: How
does the existing literature relate to these?
As you read, write: the act of writing forces you to come to grips with ideas
and focus your attention on the most signiﬁcant arguments. Eventually, you will
gain a sense of how previous research is leading you towards possible ways of
dealing with your problem. As you develop a stronger sense of the ﬁeld, strive to
ﬁlter the good from the bad. What you are doing at this point is creating an inter-
nal set of criteria on which to accept or reject arguments; that is, through this pro-
cess you are developing the skills of critical thinking. By now you will probably
have written many fragments and mini-reviews, and it is time to write a serious
ﬁrst draft of your ‘critical review of existing literature’. Before you hand this to
your supervisor for feedback, it is a good idea to put it aside for a week or so and
work on something else. Then come back to it and rework it into a second draft in
which you try to articulate the criteria you have been developing, and demonstrate
to readers just how sharp your criticisms are. Read, and think, like an examiner.
Effective critical thinking depends on effective reading. For me, the process of
reading a piece of research literature falls into phases. The ﬁrst phase, counter-
intuitively, is fairly uncritical. I try to get a sense of what the researchers were trying
to do and whether the problem is genuinely interesting, and then to understand how
they undertook the work. Once I have a broad grasp of what a paper is about, I begin
to look at issues such as whether the results really support the conclusions and
whether the experiments seem robust. A big question is whether the work is signiﬁ-
cant; some papers are genuinely remarkable, but most are an incremental contribution
and need to be analyzed from that perspective. In considering whether the work is
reliable, it also helps to consider the reputation of the authors, which may seem
unfair, but senior researchers are unlikely to knowingly put their names to poor work,
while more junior researchers may be desperate for any kind of publication.
Some papers are plain wrong or misguided. The fact that they are published
means that someone believed in them, and it is certainly the case that high-
impact journals are more trustworthy than fringe publications, but you should
always be sceptical. It is up to the author to convince you that the work is
correct. At the same time, a paper can be a strong result even if it is beyond
your comprehension.
Foundations
Give a brief, but precise, account of key work to date to establish the current state
of knowledge and belief.
Following on from the general introduction to the context of the study, write an
account of work to date that brings the examiner to the present day. In a sense,
you’re trying to answer the question: How did we get here? Again, when you
46
5
Situating the Study: The Background

search the literature, you can cluster your work in this area in terms of particular
developments, such as, historical, situational, technological, or political.
I recommend that you cite major, well-known studies and make the section rea-
sonably concise. All too often, I have seen students write tens of pages on this
foundational background material in the early stages of their thesis writing. I think
they do this for two reasons. First, the students themselves must learn this back-
ground material in order to situate and develop their own thinking in the area.
This is a necessary step, but much of this learning may not belong in the thesis, as
it will be familiar to the examiner.
Second, I suspect that students write at length about foundations simply
because it is ‘safe’. In your consideration of foundational materials, you are unli-
kely to need to engage deeply in critical thinking, and the certainty of established
material is easy to write about. Further, some aspects of undergraduate education
encourage the summarization of background information, and the writing of sum-
maries is familiar ground for students at the start of a minor thesis. When deciding
what to omit, and what to include, I suggest four rules:
• If the reader does not need certain material in order to understand what will fol-
low, then don’t include it; although, for example, we need some computer
science to understand how to process a document, much of the ﬁeld is not rele-
vant to the problem.
• Don’t make extensive use of material that has been covered in your course-
work; remember that your examiners are likely to have been your past instruc-
tors, and will not be impressed by rehashed work that they covered in your
subjects.
• Avoid including material that interrupts the ﬂow of logic in your argument;
that is, be sure to be disciplined and not drift into unrelated areas.
• Include work that is fresh and genuinely useful to the development of your
own argument; in a way, your cited authors are colleagues whom you call
upon to animate debates, generate further interest, and produce evidence for
your thesis.
Conceptual Framework
Provide a conceptual or theoretical framing for the study; place your work within
a particular perspective on the phenomenon, problem, or concept that is being
investigated.
Successful researchers work within a constrained framework. While ﬁelds of
research can span an extensive body of interrelated knowledge, which may
encompass many perspectives and approaches to a range of connected problems,
you need to focus on the main elements in the area that are relevant to your
topic. You need to read widely in the ﬁeld, and then distill the material to a
47
Conceptual Framework

limited set of concepts, to demonstrate both critical thinking (choices had to be
made) and an awareness of the constraints of a minor thesis (it is a disciplined
project).
Consider Anouck’s approach in her study of bilingual advertising. First, she
had to ‘locate’ her study along a continuum from primarily structural to prima-
rily social views of language. Speciﬁcally, she had to determine if she wanted
to view her data sample—in this case, photographs and videos of bilingual ads
on a street in Melbourne—as either representative of various components of
language (such as types of nouns, verbs, declarative forms, or questions) or as
social activities (such as type of goods and services offered, or emotional and
cultural appeals to consumers). Anouck, based on her background and experi-
ence, chose to pursue a more ‘social’ perspective; accordingly, she began to
search the literature in sociolinguistics, consumer attitudes, and multicultural
media.
You can use your justiﬁcation of the framework to demonstrate critical think-
ing. Why, for example, did you choose to go with this particular set of charac-
teristics rather than any other? The justiﬁcation can be in terms of popularity,
applicability, relevance, or perhaps the fact that the perspective has not been
applied in other studies. The key is that you do not assume that there is only
one way of viewing a problem or research question, but recognize that there is a
range of perspectives, and defend the particular conceptualization that you have
chosen to use.
Current Debates
Following from the motivation for the study, set out key areas of controversy that
inform the development of current theory and perspectives.
Having selected and justiﬁed the use of a particular framework, you need to
engage with other researchers who may or may not agree with the way a point or
concept has been framed. If the matter is settled, we do not need research. If the
matter is not settled, the concept has not been fully deﬁned and thus research is
required.
An academic debate may concern what a concept means, or what components
should or should not be included in a conceptual deﬁnition. As Anouck read pre-
vious studies, for example, she presented a debate among scholars on what it
meant to be ‘bilingual’: Did the concept exclude people who used more than two
languages? What level of proﬁciency was sufﬁcient in any of the languages to be
considered ‘bilingual’? Did a person’s ﬁrst language matter? As she explored the
literature, she found that various scholars had proposed various ways of deﬁning
terms. It was Anouck’s job to sift through the many proposals to determine which
best ﬁt her study, and to ﬁnd studies that helped her to demonstrate her critical
thinking to examiners.
48
5
Situating the Study: The Background

Another common area of debate is methodologies, or procedures for data col-
lection. In these discussions, academics consider what it means to ‘generate
knowledge’, or what ways are acceptable to ‘produce knowledge’ within a particu-
lar ﬁeld. Note that I’ve used the phrase ‘a particular ﬁeld’, as what is reasonable
for one area may not be accepted in another. For Anouck, she had to determine
the extent to which researchers who study language would be comfortable adopt-
ing ‘visual methodologies’ such as streetscape photography. Mickey had to
become familiar with standard experimental protocols for measuring the effective-
ness of document categorization methods.
A third major area of debate concerns the interpretation of the facts and data
that have been collected. Recall that an argument can, in part, be a link between
some data or results and the implications of that data. A single research result can
often be interpreted in multiple ways, and even in technical ﬁelds there can be
debate over what the underlying cause of an observation might be. Later in your
thesis, in your discussion section, you will be interpreting the outcomes of your
project; here, you may need to note that there are debates over interpretation, and
perhaps consciously take one side or another—but only with the support of reputa-
ble literature or clear reasoning, of course.
Open Issues
A discussion of the literature can be capped with discussion of issues that are
currently unresolved.
As you come to understand the perspectives, debates, and areas of active inves-
tigation in your ﬁeld, you will become aware of debates and issues that are cur-
rently unresolved. For some students, this may be the point at which a speciﬁc
question is identiﬁed: there is a gap in the literature that can be ﬁlled by develop-
ment of some speciﬁc knowledge. Such a question (or maybe a couple of related
questions) may differ slightly from the aim of your study, but nonetheless should
fall within the scope of your intended work. This is a good opportunity to return
to your ﬁrst chapter and make sure that what you have written there agrees with
your understanding from the review of literature.
Examiners can be sensitive to instances in which signiﬁcant papers are neglected
or are discussed only in passing. Key literature should always be adequately
discussed, but remember also to point out how these other studies have advanced
the discipline. For example, Mickey sometimes had a tendency to place previous
papers in one of two categories: a few papers were insightful, ground-breaking, and
of critical importance; the rest, in his view, were more or less misguided, incom-
plete, confused, foolish, or wrong. He failed to see how some papers in his second
category made useful contributions because he didn’t appreciate that much research
is incremental. The net effect was that his criticisms of previous work could seem
inconsiderate and harsh, and that made his own work appear to lack balance.
49
Open Issues

Some students make the opposite mistake: they treat all previous literature as
text that is ‘correct’ and cannot be questioned. Such students often do little more
than list previous work without providing any insights or critical assessment.
These are the students that, in my view, show the least promise as researchers,
because they appear to be satisﬁed with an unimaginative restatement of previous
claims, no matter how weak. They show little sign of imagination or critical
reﬂection.
Keep in mind that you are engaging in a conversation with other academics.
Engagement is the key concept: it is a spirit of ‘give and take’ that respects the
value of multiple perspectives. It is easy to make the mistake of thinking that the
function of the review is merely to report or describe previous studies in an effort
to show that you have ‘done your homework’. Rather, you should interweave var-
ious studies to build up the argument that the problem you are tackling is not yet
solved and still raises interesting and unanswered questions.
Methods and Approaches
Describe the ways in which other researchers are undertaking investigations in
your area.
Another section of the background is where you examine the approaches and techni-
ques used by others in research in your topic area. From your previous reading, and
from other learning opportunities such as attendance at research seminars, you will
probably have become aware of the ﬂaws in research design, research methods, and
the reporting of results that can undermine an otherwise competent investigation.
It has been claimed that almost every paper that reports experiments or a quan-
titative investigation can be found to have a ﬂaw in the research methods, so you
need to ﬁnd a balance between genuine fault ﬁnding on the one hand and gratui-
tous criticism on the other; but it is also the case that a surprising number of
papers that present strong arguments and interesting ideas have poor research
design. Once you get to know some of the common mistakes, stay alert to them as
you review previous studies. Where appropriate, point out the limitations to those
approaches. No method is perfect, but your review should lead to an understand-
ing of which methods can be used to achieve solutions to your problem. You will
need to draw on this in your next chapter, where you select appropriate methods
for your own research program.
In some disciplines, a key purpose of this part of the literature review is to
establish baselines. The aim of your work may be to improve on the state-of-
the-art: a more sensitive search method, for example. The very presence of these
comparative terms (improve, reduce) suggests that there is something you are
comparing against. This is your baseline. You need to know what the current
best competitor is, and later you will need to test whether your approach has
50
5
Situating the Study: The Background

advantages. Perhaps obviously, there is little value in showing that your
approach is better than something else that is already known to be poor—so you
need to use your literature review to show that your chosen baseline really is the
best that is currently available.
51
Methods and Approaches

Chapter 6
Explaining the Investigation:
Methods and Innovations
The core of your thesis is where you present the contribution developed in your
project. Considered as a narrative, it should ﬂow on from the background and lit-
erature review, and lead in a natural way to the results. However, the core is the
component that differs the most from project to project, and from discipline to dis-
cipline. In some cases, it may consist of a description of how data was gathered
and how that data relates to the research question. In other cases, it may consist of
an explanation of an innovative new technology, followed by an in-principle dis-
cussion of why the technology should be expected to be successful, together with
an explanation of how the technology can be evaluated. There are many further
forms of the core of a thesis.
To get a sense of what you need to discuss in this part of your thesis, the best
resource you have is the publications in your immediate ﬁeld, and other minor the-
ses that have been undertaken in your department. Ask yourself: What have other
authors chosen to discuss between the background and the results? What are the
corresponding elements of my project that need to be discussed? Here, I can only
give general advice, but strongly encourage you to think very carefully about what
should be included.
A mistake that some students make is to think of this part of the thesis as a
kind of chronological record of the work they have done, rather like an under-
graduate report on the sequence of steps performed in a lab experiment. These
students haven’t yet realised that their thesis is much the same as the research
papers they are reading—an explanation and presentation of their work to
other researchers who want to learn about their discoveries and insights.
Students who have made the transition in their writing from undergraduate
assignment to graduate investigation are on the way to becoming independent
researchers.

Methods
Explain how, and on what basis, you conducted your study.
In many theses, the chapter I am discussing is titled ‘Method’ or ‘Research
Method’. You may also see ‘Methodology’ or ‘Research Methodology’. But this
chapter should include much more than the selection and description of your method.
The methods we select are ways of testing hypotheses or answering questions or eval-
uating innovations. Therefore, if you call the chapter ‘Research Method’, you are in
danger of forgetting to deal adequately with the hypotheses or questions; and if your
thesis concerns an innovation, you need to describe it somewhere!
You have told your readers about your hypotheses or questions. Now you must
tell them which method or methods you used to test the hypotheses or answer the
questions, and why you chose them. You should ﬁrst review the methods available
to you, as I discussed in the context of your literature review, and then justify
your reasons for selecting the methods you used. Students often forget this step
altogether. You may have adopted a fairly standard method used by your prede-
cessors for testing the type of hypothesis you have put forward, or a method sug-
gested by colleagues or supervisors as suitable. In these cases you might not really
be aware that you had selected a method, but nonetheless, a selection has taken
place; one of the less obvious aspects of the progress of research is that, not only
does knowledge advance, but so does method. There are continual reﬁnements to
the statistics that are used to assess the outcomes of experiments, for example, and
debates over how best to gather feedback from people whose behaviour is being
studied.
Alternatively, you might have put a lot of thought into the selection and justiﬁ-
cation of your method, but, by the time you came to report the results, you were
so immersed in them that you forgot to say why you chose that particular method.
But no examiner is going to be kind enough to write, ‘Well, even though it is all
very unclear, I am sure that the candidate had good reasons for selecting that parti-
cular method’. Examiners are speciﬁcally asked to check whether the methods you
have adopted are appropriate. The method needs to be appropriate to your aim,
scope, and available resources, and you are the one that has set those elements in
your thesis. The main point here is to remind yourself that you need to review
your self-imposed boundaries and to justify your assumptions.
It’s worth noting that, in some disciplines, what I’ve loosely referred to here as
‘the core’ may be a complex bundle consisting of an innovation, discussion of
anticipated properties of the innovation, and explanation of criteria that the inno-
vation is intended to meet. ‘The method’ is the mechanism for evaluating whether
the innovation successfully meets these criteria. The examiner needs to be
persuaded of the rationale underlying all of these elements.
Be aware of the concept of confound. Lack of consideration of possible
confounds—that is, other reasonable explanations for the same observations—is
one of the most common weaknesses in theses. Your arguments can only be strong
if you actively seek confounds, and show that they do not invalidate your results.
54

Explaining the Investigation: Methods and Innovations

Research Methods
For a thesis, understand how your research design affects your overall argument.
There is a large literature on the topic of ‘research methods’, much of it speciﬁc
to particular disciplines. This literature is largely concerned with the practice of
research, or, in the terms I’ve used in this book, developing the research questions
and hypotheses, and designing experiments, instruments, and processes for testing
these hypotheses. There is also a substantial literature—reaching back many hun-
dreds of years—on the nature of research methods and the philosophical attempt
to link observations, experiments, and knowledge. Both of these perspectives on
research are beyond the scope of this book.
However, the issues of research methods are intertwined with the development
of your thesis. Your research should be shaped, right from the start, by your writ-
ing. Until you have made the attempt to capture your questions, methods, experi-
mental design, and so on in a precise form, you are not ready to explain and argue
for your research program. You need to be in the position of being able to say, as
unambiguously as possible, that ‘this is what I am doing’ and ‘this is how I am
going to investigate it’. Only once you have a concrete ‘this’ can your supervisor
debate it with you and help you to sharpen your arguments and your thinking.
Another way in which method and thesis are intertwined is a subtle point that
many researchers overlook: the issue of measurement, or assessment. A researcher
who uses thousands or more words of careful argument to explain a hypothesis
and its importance, and thousands more explaining how it is to be evaluated, may
nonetheless fail to justify the method being used to measure the outcomes.
Let me give an example. Suppose your project concerns how limitations in the
keyboards of mobile devices such as smartphones affect the ways in which people
report their experiences (enjoyment of a movie, opinion of a political ﬁgure, and
so on). Effective communication is the result of several factors, including audience
awareness, choice of words, background knowledge of the topic, and personal
style. In your research, you have proposed a statistic for assessing whether mes-
sages from mobile devices are likely to be inﬂuential, and propose the use of
message data to see if your statistic is in fact useful.
As a measure, you propose that messages can be regarded as inﬂuential if they
are forwarded to others, that is, you deem your statistic to be a success if it can pre-
dict whether a message will become widely distributed. This measure sounds plausi-
ble, and is appealing because the idea of having consistently successful messages
would be of interest in communication studies. But do you think that it is sufﬁcient
to simply use this measure without some rationale, or without some consideration of
the alternatives? I hope that you agree with me that the answer is no! It certainly
isn’t good enough to use a measure on the grounds that it may have some impact.
To see what I mean, consider some of the alternative measures (not all of which you
will agree with, but I think you will agree that some kind of argument could be
made for each of them): the status of the message sender; the impact in the wider
media of the message; or the translation of the message into actions.
55
Research Methods

Something I’ve found intriguing is how easily, under prompting, some students
ﬁnd problems with the measures they have been using. It is as though they have
never taken the time to think about whether their measures are defensible, plausi-
ble, or informative. Another failure of this kind occurs when students don’t con-
sider whether their measures relate to the questions they are asking. A common
one in computer science is students who examine whether a proposed method of
computation is efﬁcient, but haven’t examined whether it is correct!
These students haven’t considered whether there are confounds that would
undermine their methods, or they haven’t considered whether they have made
assumptions that other researchers would not see as justiﬁed. You need to write
about the assumptions underlying your measures in order to tighten them into a
form where they can be debated with others.
In Mickey’s case, scholars in the area of document search have published many
papers on the problem of measurement of document analysis techniques. No
approach to measurement is suitable for all research questions, and Mickey’s
underlying data (the reader recommendations in particular) was not fully consis-
tent with the kinds of data that had been used in previous similar experiments.
Nonetheless, this literature meant that he could make an informed choice of
measurement technique, and justify it by reference to experts in the ﬁeld.
Another interaction between method and thesis writing is your need to be conﬁdent
that the evidence you are gathering will, in fact, test your hypothesis. It may seem
surprising, but I have often seen research projects in which this is not the case. It may
be that a researcher goes looking for some particular data (such as numbers of people
participating in a sport), but ﬁnds that it is inconsistent or unavailable, and instead
decides to make use of other data (perhaps the numbers of people who attend sporting
events) that seems as though it will be a good approximation; but the researcher has not
realised that the connection to the original argument is lost. Or it may be that the
project was inspired by the appearance of some particular data source (such as the dis-
covery of historical records of language use among immigrants to Australia in the
1940s), but that the hypothesis that was to make use of this data had, through the course
of discussion with the supervisor, shifted away from issues that the data could resolve.
Thus it is critical that you regularly assess the relevance of your data and method
to the aims of the project. Be sure to compare the aims you have written down as
part of your introduction with your method to ensure that they correspond.
Instrumentation Design and Use
If needed, design and evaluate your instruments (survey, questionnaire, inter-
views, software, equipment, tools, and so on) or use existing instruments that are
appropriate to your study. Justify the instruments to be used to gather data.
For a minor thesis, I prefer that my students adopt existing instruments; given
the tight time frame and focus of the study, I recommend making use of
56
6
Explaining the Investigation: Methods and Innovations

established procedures, tools, questions, and so on. To do this well, however,
demands more than simply deploying an instrument in your study. You must
adapt it to ﬁt your purposes, or at least demonstrate that it is suitable.
My suggestion is to search the literature well. By now, you have read many
articles and sources; which ones used procedures that you yourself need? Revisit
those, and see if they included detailed descriptions of their questions, test items,
and the like. Write up the reason for choosing a particular one, as well as a brief
reason for rejecting other possible options. Perhaps the instrument will need to be
modiﬁed to ﬁt your own study; if so, detail and justify such modiﬁcations.
Throughout, note that you have an opportunity to demonstrate your methodologi-
cal competence and critical-thinking skills, for example by arguing for principled
adjustments to improve ‘ﬁtness for purpose’.
If your research has involved the development of tools such as software or lab
instruments, you need to consider how an examiner will regard them as validated.
You may need to report separate tests that demonstrate that this equipment is
working, or include comparisons to other ‘standard’ equipment. The requirements
are much the same as for data: you want the examiner to be satisﬁed that data has
been gathered or generated in a way that is unbiased, accurate, representative, and
so on, and you similarly want the examiner to be satisﬁed that you have used
robust equipment.
Supporting Your Arguments
Throughout your writing, maintain a critical attitude to your claims, methods, and
analysis of data.
The issues of measurement and relevance are aspects of the need for your conclusions
to be built on a robust argument. You will use your data and method as part of the
path from raw results and numbers to new knowledge; this knowledge is the primary
purpose of your thesis. This path, or chain of reasoning, is the argument.
In the context of your method, the main thing is that you need to be conﬁdent,
in at least a preliminary way, that the path exists. That is, you need to satisfy your-
self that if you gather certain data, and it has certain properties, then you can use it
to present an argument that gives a clear answer to your question. If you are not
conﬁdent that you can answer the question, then you will not be able to build the
argument on which your thesis will rest.
A perspective on a thesis is that the presentation of the argument is largely made
in the results and analysis chapters, but its foundations are actually laid here, in the
chapter on your investigation. At this point you need to have established for your-
self what the lines of the argument are going to be and addressed any scepticism
the examiners are likely to have, by examining and justifying your assumptions.
A last but signiﬁcant note on this point is that, ultimately, the argument and your
assumptions are subjective. Your ﬁnal line of defence, in choice of assumptions,
57
Supporting Your Arguments

method, and so on, is that they are reasonable and consistent. The ﬁnal product of
your effort is an objective thesis, but it would be dishonest to disguise the fact that
some elements are essentially choices, whether they arise from constraints (only cer-
tain data was available, resources were limited) or from explicit decisions (such as
approaching the problem from a particular perspective). At the same time, you need
to be conﬁdent that the reasonableness of these choices is obvious to others. If you
and your examiners cannot agree on the basis of your research, they are unlikely to
respect your outcomes.

Chapter 7
Presenting the Outcome: The Results
If you have been undertaking quantitative work—bench experiments, surveys, mea-
surements, and so on—you need to report the outcomes of your investigations. At
this stage of the research, you will have analyzed and interpreted your results, and
now you need to use them to present an argument to the reader. If your work is more
qualitative (observing and interviewing people who work in a school, for example),
you still need to present what you have found, and it may well be in the form of a
‘results’ chapter. In either quantitative or qualitative work, such a chapter provides a
basis for the analysis or discussion that completes the body of your thesis.
Many students perceive their project as, primarily, the activities of gathering, ana-
lysing, and interpreting data. From this perspective, the other stuff—such as writing,
reading the research literature, and constructing and presenting clear arguments—is
a kind of dressing up that follows the real work. There is a grain of truth to this
perspective, particularly for a typical quantitative project, in that it is the gathering
and handling of the data that leads to answers, and is the investigative part of the
work. However, this perspective also completely misses the key element of academic
research: it needs to be robust, and robustly communicated, if it is to be of any value
to others. A discovery without communication and persuasion is worthless.
The need for robustness is particularly true of the results. A typical examiner
will have seen many examples of poor work, and will read every thesis with some
scepticism as to the reliability and value of the outcomes. A thorough presentation
of the data and results is essential if your work is to be taken seriously. Generally,
about half of the thesis can be viewed as a sequence of three components: ﬁrst,
how the data was gathered and what it is intended to represent; second, what the
gathered data looks like; third, how it should be interpreted. How to present ‘what
the gathered data looks like’ is the subject of this chapter.
Before I move on, let me clarify the terminology. Discussion of how to present
results is clouded by inconsistencies in the way experiments and their outcomes are
described. In many ﬁelds of research, for example, ‘data’ is the outcome of
the recording of measurements. The data could have been recorded by you as the

researcher using the instruments you devised to test your hypotheses, or recorded by
some other researcher and then made available. Or it could have been recorded for
some other purpose, such as the temperatures recorded at a meteorological station, or
the share prices recorded at a stock exchange. But data can also be the subject of an
experiment. A researcher investigating a weather model could use temperature mea-
surements as an input, and the recorded values—‘data’ in the above deﬁnition—
could be the input to the model, which also produces ‘data’ as output. Here I use
‘data’ to describe experimental results, or measurements, and ‘outcomes’ or ‘results’
to describe what the researcher found by interpreting these measurements.
Data Preparation
Describe the ways in which the data was prepared and transformed in the process
of readying it for analysis.
There is no such thing as a perfect data set. So, when I see data that is reported in
a way that makes it seem ideal, I am suspicious. In real research, participants
don’t respond fully to surveys, answers in interviews are partial or vague, equip-
ment fails or introduces error, data sources are inconsistent, and so on.
Also, data is not usually analyzed in its raw form. For example, data collected in
an interview must be transcribed so that it appears in a written form; how detailed
the print transcription is will depend on your research question. Other data, too,
needs to be transformed: observations, for example, must be collated and categor-
ized; quantitative results may need to be checked for accuracy and completeness;
outliers from experiments need to be individually investigated; and so on.
The point is that data preparation is an essential part of your methodology and
often takes time. Students may underestimate the time that it takes to prepare the
data for analysis. As a rule of thumb, for example, 1 minute of a spoken interview
may take 5 minutes to transcribe: therefore, 1 hour of an interview will take
5 hours to transcribe. As another example, data from different sources may need
to be manipulated to allow it be analyzed with a single procedure, and it may be
that some of it will need to be manually discarded to remove anomalies such as
incomplete records. Students need to take the time to both process the data and
explain how it was handled; if some outliers are removed, for example, it needs to
be clear that there is an objective reason for doing so.
Data Analysis Procedure
Describe, and justify, the procedures for data analysis.
To impress examiners, the results of your thesis must be clear, veriﬁable, and
well presented. Clarity is achieved by being conﬁdent of what to report, and what
60
7
Presenting the Outcome: The Results

to leave out. Strive to be concise, and avoid the common tendency to report too
much; I think students do so because they feel that ‘it might be important’ in their
overall analysis, and feel that the more they report, the more it shows how hard
they have worked. Or, perhaps, they feel that their hard work is being thrown
away if some results are set aside and haven’t understood that the primary reason
for having results is to conﬁrm the answer, not necessarily to ﬁll up the thesis. If
you report results that are ‘almost signiﬁcant’, doubt about their true signiﬁcance
raises questions about your data collection procedures or perhaps the choice of
analytical procedures. Further, it shows poor critical thinking because decisions on
what to include, and what to leave out, are not justiﬁed.
To verify analysis is to be able to assure that the accuracy can be checked. At
times, if an analytical procedure is not well described or set out, it is very difﬁcult
to understand what was done to what, and under what conditions. You must
describe your analytical procedures in such a way that another researcher can fol-
low them. If the procedures are widely used in your ﬁeld, veriﬁability will not be
a challenge: if, however, you are trying a new procedure or introducing it from
another domain, you must be sure that you can explain it to your readers.
Quantitative or Qualitative Analysis?
The approach you take to presentation and interpretation of your data depends on
whether the research approach is quantitative or qualitative.
A common categorization of research is that it is either quantitative or qualitative,
or perhaps more accurately, whether it is closer to one or another of these
extremes. At times, the same set of data can be examined either way; in a minor
thesis, it is good advice to take the approach that is most prevalent in your litera-
ture review or the one that is suggested by your methodology.
The experiences of Anouck are a good example. After a review of the litera-
ture, the development of a survey, and university human research ethics clearance,
she collected data on the streets of Melbourne. She took hundreds of photographs
of bilingual advertising signs and shopfronts, and also interviewed people on the
street with her survey. When I met Anouck after her data collection sessions, we
discussed analysis of her data from both a quantitative perspective, such as map-
ping of locations, counting the number of elements in the signs, and summarizing
survey responses; and a qualitative perspective, such as thematic categorization of
the language content in the signs and survey responses, or examining common
design features of the signs.
Because Anouck had decided early on that she was going to take a ‘social’
view of language in use, I advised her to pursue a qualitative analysis of her data.
Nonetheless, I thought it would be wise to provide some descriptive statistics
ahead of the more substantial work concerning thematic categorization. To me,
the descriptive statistics would acknowledge that quantitative work is valued in
our ﬁeld, while a more complex analysis was not justiﬁed at this time. Anouck
61
Quantitative or Qualitative Analysis?

hesitated: Didn’t she have to demonstrate that she knew and understood a wide
range of analytical techniques and approaches?
My advice to Anouck—to incorporate some descriptive statistics but make the
bulk of her analysis qualitative—was based on three points. First, it would take
time for Anouck to ﬁnd, review, and write up the studies that she would need to be
able to show that she understood appropriate statistical procedures. Second, such
statistics are not widely used in studies of bilingual advertising, and there would be
few relevant examples in the literature that she could adopt. Third, I did not have
sufﬁcient background to be able to advise her to the level needed to impress exami-
ners in my department. The solution we proposed was that she outline the use of
additional statistical procedures as one of her suggestions for further research.
Mickey’s project, in contrast, was highly quantitative. His research was based
on many thousands of stories, and on thousands of users who had collectively
made nearly a hundred thousand recommendations. To this data (or subsets of it),
he had applied a range of computational techniques, producing sets of raw results
to which he had applied pairwise comparisons. At one stage, we were concerned
that as much as two months might be required just for the computations, which
would have been a serious threat to on-time completion; fortunately, we were able
to identify much faster alternatives.
Mickey’s challenges in processing and presenting this data were many. For
example, given the sheer number of individual tests, we needed to take particular
care to ensure that there were no bugs and the tests were all valid. Some of the
outcomes were very supportive of his question; so much so, in fact, that we had to
investigate these in a qualitative way, to check the possibility that the underlying
data was faulty. (It turned out that some users had copied the entirety of other
users’ recommendations, creating false reinforcement.) Some of the outcomes
seemed incoherent; again, the data had to be investigated.
Once he had explored the outcomes thoroughly enough to be satisﬁed that
the effects he was seeing were valid, he then had to make informed, representative
choices of illustrative examples of the results to present in his thesis. He had to be
careful to ensure that the examiner did not jump to the conclusion that these examples
were chosen in a biased way; at the same time, only a very few examples, and a range
of summary statistics and outcomes of statistical tests, could plausibly be included.
From Data to Results
Data is meaningless without interpretation. Results are obtained by showing how
the data relates to the original question via an argument.
You have a hypothesis; you have been busily gathering data and drawing infer-
ences, and, informally at least, linking the data to your original goal. Now you
have to take this activity and use it to persuade the reader to agree with your think-
ing. The process starts with your data.
62
7
Presenting the Outcome: The Results

A ﬁrst step is to decide, through critical thinking, what is ‘in’ and what is ‘out’.
You need to have criteria about what data to include and what data is out of scope, or
a justiﬁcation for your choice of particular data sources. Such criteria can come from
a single authoritative published source, or from synthesis of several sources. The next
step is to systematically organize the data. I cannot emphasize this enough. You need
to create spreadsheets in which the data is laid out in a regular way, or build ﬁles in
which material has been categorized by key criteria, or draw pictures showing how
the data items relate to each other, or something else; but whatever you do, get the
data under control. When a student walks into my ofﬁce clutching a big pile of print-
outs, or shows me a folder full of ﬁles on the computer with no idea of what the ﬁle
names mean or what is in them, or has lost track of which version of the data is
correct, or which graph is current, I know the student is in trouble. A casual approach
to managing your data may not seem to create issues early on, but leave things too
long and the complexities will begin to compound and get out of control. Keep in
mind, too, that having well-organized data helps protect you from possible accusa-
tions of falsiﬁcation of results and gives you conﬁdence in the outcomes.
Materials that are in a mess suggest that the thinking is in a mess. This is a
good point for self-reﬂection: if you ﬁnd that your arrangement of the materials
has become chaotic, then maybe your grasp is chaotic too. Take yourself back to
ﬁrst principles, ask basic questions about the data and what it is supposed to repre-
sent, think about how you would like to see it organized—and then make it hap-
pen. Remember that a core skill of research is careful thinking. Take heed of signs
that suggest you can improve, and act on them. Readers won’t trust your results
unless they understand that your data is fair, unbiased, and representative. A clear
presentation of how the data was chosen, what its properties are, and so on, is
essential to establishing trust with the reader, and, just as importantly, satisfying
yourself that your data is complete and correct.
Presentation
You need to explain the data to your reader; this may be more difﬁcult than you
expect. It is summaries and interpretations of the data, not raw numbers, tran-
scriptions, or photographs, that are likely to be of the most value.
In the previous chapters of your thesis you described the design of your work,
explaining how it tested your hypotheses or answered your research questions.
You now have to present the results you obtained in this work.
This presentation should not be haphazard. The presentation should educate the
reader. You may believe that your task is to include every single data point or
case that you recorded in your work—but doing so is almost certainly a mistake.
You have used this data to draw conclusions as objectively as you can; now the
task is to use representative examples drawn from the data, and example analyses
of the data, to persuade the reader of the validity of these conclusions.
63
Presentation

In any case, even when the data is limited, it is surprisingly difﬁcult to capture
it all within the conﬁnes of a thesis. Even a brief explanation of a single interview
subject might take a page or two; an explanation of how a procedure is applied in
one instance in a case study may take pages. Anouck had hundreds of photo-
graphs; Mickey’s raw results had millions of individual data points, and hundreds
of secondary products could be built on these, such as tables and graphs showing
the relative effectiveness of the different document analysis methods. Inclusion of
all the data is unlikely to be feasible.
And what would be the point of simply dumping the data into the thesis? It is unli-
kely to be meaningful to the reader. Here are the things the reader needs to know:
• How the data was gathered—where it was sourced from, what aspects of it
were measured, what it consists of, what the guidelines were, what permissions
were required, what restrictions apply, and so on.
• How the data might be obtained by a reader—whether directly from you, or
from an external source; or how similar data might be created.
• What the results look like—by example; or by graph, to show, say, the distribu-
tion of values; or by table of typical instances. For example, a common strategy
is to list out the categories into which the data can be placed, and give an
example of an item in each category.
• Summaries of the complete set of results, in as rich a way as possible.
• Notes of issues such as known gaps or incompleteness in the results, or where
the data may be uncertain or unreliable.
• Analyses of the results, using discussion, argument, statistical tools, and so on,
as appropriate to the work.
• Interpretation of the analyses, completing a transformation from data to infor-
mation to knowledge (more on this later).
Inclusion of the raw data is not in this list. Note, by the way, that many disci-
plines, and most institutions, have research guidelines for how data is managed,
retained, and described. Make sure you are familiar with these guidelines as you
work through your data presentation.
Somewhere you may want to discuss the data you didn’t gather, but would
have liked to, and other issues of that kind. My advice is that this is a good thing
to do. No piece of research is really complete, and the reader will appreciate your
views on where the work could be extended. For the examiner, such discussion
shows that you are thoughtful enough to be aware of the shortcomings of your
study. Remember that the examiner may well notice them without your help—and
acknowledgement of shortcomings is not a sign of weakness.
Reﬂect on whether another researcher trying to reproduce your work would
succeed in doing so—or whether you would succeed in doing so. One of the
classic fallacies of science is that, if you repeat an experiment with small
variations until it succeeds, and then stop, it may seem as though the desired
outcome is achieved. However, if there is any kind of uncertainty in the
experiment, it is possible that the positive outcome occurred by chance. If this
success is all that is reported, the reader gets a highly distorted view of the
true results.

Presenting the Outcome: The Results

Analysis
Analysis of data is how it is examined for properties of interest, which can then be
related to the question. Analysis is closely linked to presentation, because good
presentation is required for understanding.
Two key concepts in every aspect of managing data and presenting results are
variables (or parameters) and category. These concepts reﬂect how we understand
data. Assigning instances to categories lets you discuss and analyze data in a con-
solidated way. Variables determine the behaviour of the data, and we have under-
stood what is going on when we can accurately predict how variables and data
values interact. These concepts underpin how you proceed with data analysis, and
also underpin how you proceed to teach the reader about the data.
And it is not only the reader who is learning. Your presentation of results is
part of your process of interpreting them—writing the results chapter is part of a
cycle of understanding, not an end point. Your aim is to educate others, and self-
learning is likely to be part of the process, even at this late stage of thesis writing.
I’ve noted that it isn’t valuable to include raw data, and nor is it persuasive to
just include one or two brief examples, but don’t go to the opposite extreme. In one
thesis I examined, the candidate had discovered the power of a graph-drawing facil-
ity. His results chapter contained over a hundred graphs plotted by trawling through
all of his data sets and plotting every variable against every other possible variable.
His readers were given so much information, at such a low level, that they were
totally overwhelmed, and learnt nothing about the system under examination.
From my discussion of earlier chapters, you can see how important it is that
you state the purpose of the chapter in its introduction, and that you write a sum-
mary in which you describe how that purpose has been fulﬁlled. This rule is as
important for the results chapter as for any other. At the end of the chapter, you
should share with your readers your understanding of what is now known, but
was unknown when the chapter began.
Reasoning from Data
A strong result rests on an interpretation of data that yields new knowledge.
The aim is to use your data to make a case for the proposition being explored in your
thesis. Consider the dictum: ‘data is not information, information is not knowledge,
and knowledge is not wisdom’. As soon as you use data to examine a question—to
make a link between a proposition and some observations—it becomes information
(what the data tells us). For example, temperature measurements collected by the
weather bureau become information when used in conjunction with records of plant
growth to test the hypothesis that plants grow faster at higher temperatures. Similarly,
the data collected using your research instruments becomes information when you use
it to test the hypotheses that led to the design of the instruments.
65
Reasoning from Data

Information becomes knowledge when you use an argument to draw conclusions
from it: plants do grow more vigorously at higher temperatures, for example. Here,
the argument is an explanation of how the information demonstrates the conclu-
sions, and will probably need to explain why other plausible interpretations of the
information are likely to be incorrect (you need to eliminate confounds). The argu-
ment will also need to explore the subtleties of the data—to demonstrate that the
number of measurements is sufﬁcient for statistical signiﬁcance, for example.
Knowledge makes a contribution when it is integrated into a way of looking at
things. It is the implications that you draw from your results that are useful to
others: new insights, new theory, new frameworks. Your results chapter is a key-
stone of the hypothesis-evidence-argument-theory (HEAT) structure of much
research, which can be sketched as:
• development of a question or initial hypothesis, which is used to shape the
gathering of some observations
• formation of a deﬁnite question
• building of tools and use of them to gather measurements to be used as evidence
• construction of an argument that uses the evidence to give a case for or against
the hypothesis
• conclusion by developing a contribution to a theory, understanding, or framework.
(As an aside, too many students—and some supervisors!—confuse theories and
hypotheses. Theories are the building blocks of research. They represent our best
understanding to date: the theory of relativity, the theory of evolution, and so on. They
are the concepts in which we have the greatest conﬁdence. A hypothesis is an uncon-
ﬁrmed supposition. Another, arguably worse, confusion is between theory and specu-
lation; some people think they are theorizing when they propose new untested ideas,
but from a more formal perspective they may be doing little more than guessing.
While such sloppiness is ﬁne in conversation, it has no place in a research thesis.)
The HEAT analysis of the research process points towards what you should
include in the results chapter and what you should leave out. Raw measurements
do not convey knowledge unless you explain or display them in a suitable way,
and should be left out or possibly just relegated to appendices. Results that are dis-
played in the form of tables or ﬁgures that enable you and the reader to make
sense of the outcomes become information, and should be included.
Illustrations
In many theses, effective illustrations are crucial to support the explanations and
interpretation. Poor illustrations will undermine the value of your work.
A typical results chapter consists of argument and narrative supported by illustra-
tions, such as graphs, diagrams, photographs, and tables. But why are you using
them? A typical answer to this question is: ‘I include a ﬁgure when it expresses a
66
7
Presenting the Outcome: The Results

point more clearly than does the written word’. On this principle, illustrations are
likely to play a role in many parts of your thesis; I discuss them here because the
results chapter is one place where they are not just helpful, but essential.
However, the use of illustrations to make a point is, I believe, only part of the
reason they are of value. If you wish to get the best out of your illustrations, you
need to put yourself in the position of your readers. Do they read the written text
until they get to the sentence, ‘Figure 6 shows that an increase in the migrant
population is correlated with an increased use of bilingual advertising’, and then
dutifully ﬁnd Figure 6 to check that this is indeed so? Probably not. My experi-
ence is that, long before readers begin to work through your results chapter, they
will have opened the thesis and skimmed through it, ‘reading’ the diagrams and
looking at the graphs and tables. It is this, rather than the careful reading that
comes later on, that allows the examiner to form an initial understanding of your
results.
After other preliminaries, such as identifying the aim of the research and read-
ing the conclusions, the real reading begins. The written text develops ideas in the
way that the writer intended, and readers will no doubt follow this development.
But at the same time they will be generating their own interpretations and impres-
sions. They will compare material in one chapter with diagrams or text in another
in ways that the writer had not anticipated. They might refer to and puzzle over
Fig. 6 long before they read the text that discusses it. They might return to it
again when something written in Chapter 3 triggers another train of thought. Such
exploratory reading is an essential part of thorough understanding of complex work.
Readers can use complementary channels of communication simultaneously,
including both words and images. They do not use one at a time, switching from
one to the other; rather, they can use them at the same time, perhaps giving more
attention to one than to others at any given moment. This leads to some guidelines
about visual material:
• The reader should not have to read the text that refers to the illustration to
understand what the illustration is meant to demonstrate. Although an illustra-
tion should always be referenced by the written text, it should make sense by
itself. In the caption, you should explain the context and how the illustration
should be interpreted, and draw attention to features you wish the reader to
note, even if you have discussed these in some detail in the text.
• Don’t cram in too much detail. When I ask students for their view on the func-
tions of tables, for example, they often reply that it is to record data such as
experimental readings in a systematic way. This being so, a table might have to
contain large amounts of data, perhaps extending over several pages. In my
view such data should not go in the main text, but rather in an appendix—or be
omitted altogether. A table in the main text must be a complementary channel
of communication, and illustrative rather than exhaustive; that’s why they’re
called illustrations.
• Reserve the use of illustrations for things that are important. The reader will
focus on them and assume that they are the most signiﬁcant part of your work;
67
Illustrations

use of illustrations for minor outcomes can skew the reader’s understanding of
your argument.
• Put material in a table only when the pattern obtained by arranging things in
rows and columns tells the reader something in ways that are better than or dif-
ferent from a written description. If the data in your table seems to you to
demonstrate some trend or correlation, you should consider displaying the trend
by means of a graph.
• A diagram should be a net beneﬁt to understanding. If the work of explaining
a diagram that illustrates, for example, text analysis mechanisms is more
work than simply explaining the mechanism, then the diagram is an unhelp-
ful burden and should be discarded. (It can be helpful, though, to develop
such diagrams for your own beneﬁt, as they can clarify your understanding
and help you to focus on what you are trying to say.) However, never
overlook the possibility that a pertinent diagram can greatly improve your
presentation.
There are three kinds of ﬁgures: diagrams, graphs, and images such as photo-
graphs. This book is not the place to give detailed advice on preparation of such
materials, but you should be aware of some general principles.
Some authors like to describe aspects of their work as line diagrams made up
of boxes, circles, arrows, labels, and so on. Such diagrams can be a powerful way
of explaining relationships, but they are inevitably simpliﬁcations of complex
situations, and may become so simple that they are misleading. A diagram may be
a useful way of illustrating the mechanics of speech, for example, but that doesn’t
mean that a diagram is the right way to show the connection between the historical
factors that lead to productive bilingualism.
In Anouck’s study of bilingual advertising in urban spaces, she had taken many
photographs of signs and shopfronts. Which ones should be included, if any?
I suggested that one representative photograph be placed in her methodology sec-
tion (to give an indication of the streetscape, and to illustrate her data collection),
and that perhaps two or three more be put in her results section to show which fea-
tures she was particularly concerned with in her analysis. The other photographs,
I suggested, should be ﬁled away, with the understanding that they could be
accessed if requested by an examiner.
Graphs are used to demonstrate trends or correlations, so you need to think
carefully about what you are trying to demonstrate.
Usually you will be either conﬁrming an established model or developing a
new one, and you should have this in mind when plotting your graph.
With the ready availability of rich tools for creating graphs, such as three-
dimensional and coloured plots, the challenge for the author is to repeatedly ask
the questions: Is this element necessary? And is it tasteful? The more detail there
is, the less likely that it will be correctly understood. My advice is to test your
graphs (and other diagrams too, of course) on other students and friends, and listen
to what they have to say. If they don’t understand what is going on, simpliﬁcation
may be required.

Presenting the Outcome: The Results

In Mickey’s case, there is a long history of research on categorization of docu-
ments, with results displayed using a range of established visual presentation tech-
niques. On the one hand, he had to be careful to stay within these conventions, to
ensure that his results could be easily understood. On the other hand, this history
meant that he had strong examples to use as models when developing graphs, so
he did not have to put too much effort into deciding whether a style of presenta-
tion would be effective.
Some theses in lab disciplines used to include photographs of equipment such as
assemblies for preparation of chemicals; maybe they still do. I am not persuaded
that such photographs are more useful than a diagram, and while I’ve seen a good
number of cases where the photograph was included but seemed unnecessary,
I can’t recall a case where I thought more photographs were required. However,
sometimes it is clear that images are necessary—of healthy and unhealthy cells, for
example, or of screenshots that demonstrate a software interface.
Some students appear to be comfortable with including truly appalling illustra-
tions in their work. Unfamiliarity with tools is certainly part of this problem, as is
the ‘but I am not an artist’ excuse. Perhaps they say to themselves that artwork is
out of their expertise, and use this as a reason to quickly sketch something without
even seeking advice. Unhelpfully, the tools for drawing ﬁgures and graphs with
which most students are familiar are designed for very general applications; they
are used by school children even before they can read and write. That is not to say
that these tools aren’t useful—but their default settings are certainly not intended
for pictures that are to be included in research publications.
There are many speciﬁc things that I ﬁnd jarring. This list is far from exhaustive:
• Lack of principles. Does a box represent an individual, or a collection, or an
action? What is the difference between a black arrow and a coloured fat arrow?
Do the colours have any signiﬁcance? Why so many fonts and font sizes? Why
are they so different from each other, and so much bigger or smaller than the
regular text?
• Congestion. Lines that cross each other unnecessarily; arrows that end in space,
or just inside the thing being pointed at; lines that might be pathways, but
might be part of a boundary; things under other things.
• Clip art. Are comical sketches (drawn by someone else, and often not very
good) really what you want as the most visible feature in your thesis?
• Badly rendered photographs.
• Graphs with grid lines and unnecessary boundaries, poorly captioned legends,
and too many lines. Missing data, out-of-proportion marks and line widths,
poor use of space, and inappropriate sizing can all make a graph impossible to
read, or worse, impossible to take seriously.
There are many good software tools for presentation, some of them free, in
addition to those that are included in the common word-processing packages.
Take the time to ask around and evaluate the options; you may be surprised at
how much difference there is between them.
69
Illustrations

Many of the principles noted above for ﬁgures are just as applicable to tables.
They should be self-contained, with detailed captions; they should not be amateur-
ish. Choices need to be made about what grid lines to include or omit, how to
align data in columns, what is important, and so on. Complex tables can present
particular difﬁculties, when for example the data is multi-factorial but needs to be
represented on a two-dimensional piece of paper.
I’ve found that a great way to ﬁnd examples of good tables is to leaf through a
ﬁrst-rate journal. These journals use professional typesetters to arrange tables, and
have deep experience in which table elements are clarifying and which are unhelp-
ful. This is again a case where the defaults in word-processing software are
poor—indeed, I would say they are dreadful. Find good examples from your disci-
pline, and imitate them.
A ﬁnal thought on this topic is that many of the problems I see in ﬁgures and
tables are, I suspect, due to the fact that authors don’t anticipate how much work
they are going to be. Given that the illustrations will be a conspicuous element in
your thesis, expect them to require real effort to get right.

Chapter 8
Wrapping it up: Discussion and Conclusion
In your background and literature review, contribution, and results, you have assembled
the pieces of your project as a structured explanation of your work. You now need to
explain the contribution of the project: how it adds to or alters existing knowledge. The
discussion section is where you explain the value of your work, the signiﬁcance of
your discoveries and outcomes, their limitations, and their implications for the wider
ﬁeld in terms of both theory and practice. This is followed by a brief conclusion. The
way this chapter is structured and presented is another component of a minor thesis that
varies from discipline to discipline, but there are signiﬁcant common elements.
Summary of Key Findings
Brieﬂy summarize your overall outcomes, and how they were achieved.
It is helpful for the examiner if the ﬁnal chapter begins with a brief summary of
the overall project: it is a reminder of what you have set out to accomplish, but
also it shows that you understand the project well enough to explain it concisely.
For a minor thesis, two or three paragraphs are sufﬁcient.
To get started, re-read your introduction with a focus on the motivation for the study
and its aim and scope. Now rewrite these in a few sentences, keeping in mind that the
reader has now been educated by you in your topic, and so can be spoken to in a more
informed way. Next, go to your review of literature and write about the main ideas and
trends that you found and then summarize the key results in a few sentences. You are
now prepared, as is the reader, to consider your work in the context of the ﬁeld.
Discussion of Results
In light of the knowledge in your ﬁeld, and with your research questions in mind,
discuss how the outcomes of your thesis contribute to current understanding.

The difference between a report or essay and a thesis is that the latter is charac-
terized as a sustained argument that helps to build or inform current knowledge.
When writing a ﬁrst thesis, many of my students have felt intimidated, as they
believed that they were not yet ready to make a contribution to the ﬁeld. I tell
them, and many ﬁnd this surprising, that around half of all published research is
done by students; though most of them are Ph.D. candidates, it is nonetheless the
case that students doing minor theses often produce publishable work.
One way that I use to get students to begin to write their contribution is to have
them imagine that they are in a conversation with some of the main researchers
that they have reviewed in the literature. Suppose, for a moment, that you are in a
meeting with other researchers in your speciﬁc area of study. What would you say
to them? Now, with experience, would you agree or disagree with some of the
results that they themselves have found? (In an engaging presentation, one of my
students found pictures of prominent researchers and pretended to converse with
them as she set out her work.) So, to get started, reread your own review of litera-
ture and then begin to draft the conversation in writing.
An effective way to open your discussion is to list points of agreement with
previous work. For example, you may have found that your results largely support
a particular hypothesis or way of doing things. Your contribution here is that you
are strengthening our conﬁdence in what others have found. As you continue,
consider the points in the literature that you disagree with as a result of your own
work. By ‘disagree’, I mean that you should highlight gaps or errors in our under-
standing. Your work, perhaps, helps to ﬁll some of these gaps in ways that may
be novel, innovative, or even surprising to others in the ﬁeld. Indeed, this is your
contribution, and you should show that you are proud of it.
Your research questions should be prominent throughout your discussion.
Some students use the research question as a heading and then respond to it
directly. Other students restate the research question in a paragraph, for example,
and then refer to it as they continue to discuss results. Whichever approach you
choose, be sure that you respond in a substantial way to your research questions
as you assemble your ﬁnal discussion. Again, this part of your thesis is where you
are making a contribution, as you converse with other scholars in your ﬁeld.
Implications
To further illustrate the contributions of your thesis, explain their potential
broader inﬂuence.
Examiners expect that you consider ways in which your work can have an impact
or be inﬂuential. You do not have the time or resources to establish this broader inﬂu-
ence in a systematic way, but possible implications of your work can be discussed.
An obvious implication is that the results might suggest new questions. For example,
if ﬁction can be successfully categorised by use of statistical methods, what does this
72
8
Wrapping it up: Discussion and Conclusion

imply for search methods? What does it imply for other texts, such as newspaper
articles? If ﬁction cannot be usefully processed in this way, what mechanisms might
be explored in subsequent work, and why might they succeed where statistics has
failed? What might the causes of failure be? And so on.
Once students have thought about the scholarly implications of their work—or
how their results may inﬂuence research—I like to encourage them to consider
how their work could be applied to the ‘wider world’. It has been suggested that
there are ﬁve key areas for consideration.
Pedagogy
How might the results of your thesis inﬂuence teaching and learning? If your
work relates in some way to the way people teach and learn about your ﬁeld, con-
sider its pedagogical implications. Your results may inﬂuence the way that an
entire teaching program (or curriculum) is understood, such as the ways in which
new material or technologies are integrated into classrooms. Assessment and
evaluation practices, too, may beneﬁt from the application of your results.
Policy
In what ways do the results of your thesis inﬂuence areas of policy for institutions,
businesses, organizations, or governments? Policies are developed through com-
plex, and often political, processes with a range of stakeholders. If appropriate,
consider how the outcomes of your own study may inﬂuence such processes and
resource allocations as relevant to your domain of study. In this area, your work
would help to set the priorities for policy leaders and other inﬂuential people.
Professional Development
How do the results of your thesis inform the way that professionals in your ﬁeld are
trained? Think about people who are already working in the ﬁeld, and how they
maintain their understanding of current and innovative practices in their area. You
may want to suggest speciﬁc areas of professional development that can beneﬁt from
your work, or how aspects of your ﬁndings could be taught to current professionals.
Practice and Methodology
How might the way that you conducted your study affect future data collection,
research designs, or analytical procedures? If your study has involved innovative
73
Implications

methods or instruments to gather data, write about the ways in which your innova-
tion could be applied to future studies. For example, it may be that your approach
to data collection yielded richer results, was more efﬁcient, or otherwise provided
insights that had not been previously considered. Also, if your project was an
interdisciplinary study, and combined practices from different areas, highlight how
such combinations have led to greater understanding.
Products
How could the results of the study inﬂuence the way products such as materials,
software, and instrumentation are designed and built? During your minor thesis, you
may have developed a product such as a new material, innovative software or algo-
rithms, a piece of machinery, or a tool. Consider the implications of this creation:
How has your design improved on its predecessors? Who might adopt it? What other
tools might be improved or adapted to make use of your development? In what ways
is it more efﬁcient, more reliable, or less expensive to produce and maintain? You
may not know the answer to such questions, but simply raising them, in particular
contexts, will demonstrate your appreciation for the implications of your work.
The implications of your thesis will not touch on all of these ﬁve areas; indeed,
I encourage students to highlight one or two of them. The main part of writing
about the implications of your work is to move ‘theory into practice’, to show that
your work has relevance in the world beyond research.
Limitations of the Study and Critical Reﬂection
If the study were to be repeated, what would you do differently? What are some of
the ways in which the project may be limited?
Often, criteria for examination include an awareness of the limitations of the
project. You should reﬂect on areas of your minor thesis that could have led to
better outcomes if you had, for example, more resources, a greater range of data
collection procedures, or a larger sample size. You should also reﬂect on your
scope, and in particular on what lies outside it. Where might Anouck’s results on
bilingualism be of low relevance? In what circumstances could Mickey’s method
be unreliable, or inapplicable?
Maintain a sense of conﬁdence and maturity as you write about the limitations
of your study. This is not meant to be an occasion for exposing failings or present-
ing your shortcomings, but is simply an opportunity to show that you understand
your work—which includes knowing what it did not achieve. Your examiners will
be well aware that any project has limitations, mistakes, and errors of judgment,
74
8
Wrapping it up: Discussion and Conclusion

and an acknowledgement of such limitations shows a reﬂective, insightful mind. It
also helps guide others to not repeat your mistakes.
To spark your thinking in this area, revisit the ‘aim and scope’ section of
your introduction so that you yourself understand how you set the initial
boundaries of your own work. If you have worked well within those bound-
aries, then discuss some of the shortcomings. However, do not take responsibil-
ity for shortcomings that were beyond your initial boundaries or scope. Again,
reﬂect on the scope you developed early in your project, and perhaps revise it
before submission.
Agenda for Further Research
Suggest ways to extend the current project and thus contribute to further research.
To set an agenda is to nominate priorities for work with an awareness of limited
time and resources. It helps to deﬁne what is important and valued and what is not.
To help my students explore further questions, I ask them to imagine that they
are in front of an interview panel for a research position in the ﬁeld. They would
face questions such as, ‘Having completed a thesis, how would that work continue
to be developed?’ or ‘If we did hire you, how would you direct your research?
What larger outcomes would you seek to achieve?’
Agendas can be set wide or narrow, from abstract to practical, and can be
global or local. The tone to set in this section, I think, is one that can be best
described as ‘pragmatic idealism’. That is, it is important to remain positive and
visionary, but not to be so farfetched in your thinking as to stretch credibility. One
aspect of agenda-setting is to think of ways in which your work may beneﬁt from
collaboration with other ﬁelds, or be interdisciplinary, in ways that may be innova-
tive and exciting. This is the classic ‘thinking outside the box’ way of setting an
agenda.
Another way to begin to set an agenda is to outline, or sketch, a series of pro-
jects that would result in a particular goal. To be able to achieve a ﬁnal goal, some
particular subgoals must ﬁrst be completed; identify these subgoals and explain
how they would cumulatively lead to signiﬁcant advances in the ﬁeld.
Conclusion
Write a brief conclusion to your entire thesis by restating the motivation for the
study, its aim and scope, central results, and key contributions.
Conclusions should be complete and concise. For a minor thesis, I suggest that
the conclusion consist of no more than three or four paragraphs. First, re-read
75
Conclusion

your introduction and re-state the main points. Next, re-read the literature review
and nominate a few key ideas that led to research questions. Re-state the research
questions as appropriate, and then give a brief summary of data collection
and key results; I encourage students to make a simple deﬁnite statement that is
a defensible claim about their outcomes. Finally, summarize the contributions in
terms of both outcomes and implications, and then end with a recap of sugges-
tions for further research. In your ﬁnal few sentences, avoid a tendency to be
grandiose or make statements that are not supported by the evidence and argu-
ments in the thesis; your style should be mature and conﬁdent, but not exces-
sively ﬂowery.
It is essential to forge the links between the introduction and the conclusion,
and between the discussion and the conclusion. As this is the ﬁnal conclusion,
it follows that the discussion does not need a separate conclusion of its own.
(For this reason, I ﬁnd it clearer to have end-of-chapter summaries throughout
the thesis, except in this ﬁnal chapter in which there is a conclusion to the
entire work.)
You should now have a deep sense of satisfaction about the whole minor thesis!
Any residual doubts may indicate that something is wrong earlier in the document,
and you should try to ﬁnd out what it is. Some diagnostics are as follows.
• Draw your conclusion solely from the discussion. I have already hinted at this.
If the discussion chapter is where you draw together everything you have done
in your whole research project (not just your own experiments or surveys, but
also your reviews and analyses of the work of others), then this must be the
basis for your conclusion. If you ﬁnd yourself wishing to include themes or
outcomes that you have not worked over in the discussion, you have either
omitted something important from the discussion or, more likely, you are still
hankering after more than one aim.
• There should be only minimal discussion in the conclusion. If you ﬁnd
yourself wanting to engage in further discussion, or are still quoting from
the literature, you should have incorporated this material in your discussion.
The ﬁnal conclusion is a good place to tightly link together the themes that
have emerged in your thesis, but a detailed analysis should take place
elsewhere.
• The conclusion should respond to the aim stated in the ﬁrst chapter. If you
take your problem statement and the aim from your introduction, and follow
these with your conclusions, the result should be a mini-document that reads
logically. When looking at the ﬁrst draft of a thesis from one of my own stu-
dents, or examining a thesis from some other student, I always put it to this
test. It often reveals that the writer omitted to state the aim, and it is only when
I read the conclusions at the end that I can start to deduce what the unstated
aim must have been.
76
8
Wrapping it up: Discussion and Conclusion

• Summaries are not conclusions. Summaries are a brief account of what you
found out; conclusions are a statement of the signiﬁcance of what you found
out. If you are merely summarizing the argument developed in your discussion
chapter, you will feel quite unhappy with your conclusion. There will be no
sense of closure. Also, you will almost certainly have failed to respond to the
aim of the whole project. (Sometimes this happens when the aim is too modest,
or even woolly. For example, when researchers say that their aim is to investi-
gate the properties of a system, they may end up with a list of properties, that
is, a summary. This is not research.)
• Conclusions should be crisp and concise. The conclusion section may be only
a page or so, but brevity can help create a sense of closure.
Appendices
Appendices are the logical place to keep material that supports the main argu-
ment, but is needed only for reference.
Appendices do not participate in the main thread of argument, but their purpose
is to support the overall thesis in one way or another. They might establish
the context of an item in the main text, or give the derivation of an equation. They
are often used as a repository for raw or transcribed data. They might give a
sample of a completed questionnaire; in this case the main text would describe
how the researcher constructed and administered the questionnaire, and would
summarize the results obtained. In some cases, a human research ethics clearance
or a permission form to gather data might be included in an appendix.
As appendices are there to support material in the main text, you should insert
a reference to them at the appropriate point. It is pointless to include appendices
that you don’t refer to in the text. (You may think that this is too obvious to men-
tion, but I have often seen stand-alone appendices.) Give the appendix an appro-
priate title—not just ‘Appendix 3’, but ‘Appendix 3: Derivation of the Logistic
Equation’—and brieﬂy explain its purpose.
Some students include an appendix without justiﬁcation. I wonder if this is
‘shopping cart’ reasoning: the student wants to have one of everything in the the-
sis: one table of contents, one introduction, one elaborate ﬁgure, one appendix,
and so on. If it is clear that you have material that the examiner is likely to require,
and it is clear that this material does not belong in the main body of the thesis,
then put it in an appendix. Otherwise, leave it out.

Chapter 9
Before You Submit
You have just typed the ﬁnal sentence of your conclusion. Finished at last?
Wrong—you still have a great deal of work to do. You have two major tasks
ahead: you must revise your ﬁrst draft in response to the criticisms of your super-
visor and friends, and, when you have done that, you must check the details of the
whole work.
What you have done is to ﬁnish a complete ﬁrst draft: a collection of chapters
written according to the structure you devised. Now you need to focus on ‘struc-
tural editing’. At this point, it may appear to you (and your supervisor) that each
chapter is coherent, but you have to consider whether the entire thesis, as an
extended argument, is coherent and consistent. You also need to check whether
your argument systematically progresses from the aim to the conclusion; whether
your aim itself has drifted during the course of the research; whether there is extra-
neous material that you should transfer to appendices, or delete; and whether
important insights have emerged to which you gave little or no prominence in
your original structure, but which are now demanding more attention. When you
have ﬁxed all of these points, the structural editing is complete.
As you work through the second draft, you will also need to work on sentence-
level editing with a focus on details. There are many aspects to check: spelling,
punctuation, captions to ﬁgures and tables, references, and consistency in every-
thing including notation, nomenclature, format, reference style, and writing style.
Although these tasks are not always intellectually demanding, you have to do
them properly, and they take time. And they are important. What may seem to
you to be minor errors in your text can send the reader a strong subconscious mes-
sage that, fundamentally, you don’t care about the work and it has been done in a
sloppy way. Such messages are damaging to your ﬁnal grade and professional
reputation.
This chapter is based on material originally written by David Evans.

From First to Second Draft
After completion of a ﬁrst full draft, a surprising amount of work remains, includ-
ing the task of getting good feedback from your supervisor.
Some students, when they have typed that last full stop in their ﬁnal chapter,
print out a clean copy of the entire thesis and give the whole thing to their supervisor
to read. Although this gives students a strong sense of completion, and of self-
congratulation for all of their hard work, there are many reasons why this is not a
good idea. First, the supervisor should have been giving feedback chapter by
chapter, and may already have expressed satisfaction with some chapters while ask-
ing for extensive revision of others. If a supervisor thinks a chapter is done, there
may be no need to ask that the material be read again. Second, you should submit
work for review only after you have reviewed it. If you can see that further revision is
necessary, why waste your supervisor’s time doing work that you can do yourself? If
a chapter is in good shape, you are likely to receive thoughtful feedback, rather than
comments that do no more than point out that the work is still full of problems.
Handing over a thesis chapter by chapter means that you can continue to work
while waiting for feedback. A supervisor who is given a complete ﬁnal draft of a
thesis may not return the manuscript for weeks, and such delay is likely to be frus-
trating for you.
What I do with the ﬁrst draft is parallel to what I expect examiners of a thesis to do:
I assess it. The only difference is that, because I am your supervisor, I am now familiar
with the trajectory of your argument and approach, and I guard against reading things
into the draft that you have not actually explained. When you are reading your own
work, a common problem is that you see things that are not really there. For that
reason, you should put your thesis aside for a few days before you read it as a whole.
When making a detailed review of a thesis, I prefer to work on a printed copy.
Despite decades of experience of writing documents on screen, I ﬁnd that a complex
document cannot be read thoroughly in electronic form. As word-processing software
improves, the advantages of hard copy are reduced, but it is still easier to thoroughly
read and annotate a large document on a printout than on a screen.
On the topic of supervisor feedback, form your own judgments about its relia-
bility. Some supervisors are extremely careful and give speciﬁc advice on what to
ﬁx and how to do it. Others tend to give generic advice that can lead an incautious
student to make a mass of unnecessary changes. A colleague of mine was tormen-
ted by his supervisor’s habit of asking for a change on one draft, then, on the next,
asking for it to be changed back. The problem was that the supervisor sometimes
didn’t take the time to read the work properly, and thus didn’t appreciate why
things had been presented in a certain way. Be sceptical and think for yourself
about everything, and do not blindly follow what may be wrong information or
bad advice—especially when you know it is wrong.
Sometimes, speciﬁc advice is not appropriate; if I see some sentence or argu-
ment I don’t understand, but where I suspect the student hasn’t really thought
about what they are trying to say, I may simply annotate it with a comment such
80
9
Before You Submit

as, ‘Are you sure you know what this means?’ I expect my students to understand
that ﬁxing it means that, ﬁrst of all, they need to try and analyze, then rectify, the
problem for themselves—but I also expect them to check with me before doing
anything drastic. If the problem is subtle or complex, I’ll also include an explana-
tion of the issues I’ve found, because, while I do want my students to develop
their critical-thinking skills, I don’t want them to waste their time.
In the early stages of working together, Mickey wasn’t good at handling feed-
back from me. He was not an experienced writer and, although he produced text
quickly, it was often full of minor mistakes. Worse, it tended to be disorganized,
with bundles of unrelated thoughts gathered into the same paragraph, or the same
topic discussed in multiple places. Indeed, this was something like his style in
conversation! I did not see this way of generating text as a problem, but what was
a problem was that the resulting ‘brain dump’ was unreadable. In one instance,
I gave him detailed, constructive feedback in terms of grammar, word choices,
organization, ﬂow of ideas, and comments on missing or unnecessary text, which
we reviewed together in a meeting. I later found out that he had felt that my exten-
sive comments—there was a lot of ink on his draft—were a way of telling him
that the manuscript was rubbish. Eventually, he understood that my intent was to
help, not hinder. If you are in doubt, talk to your supervisor about how to handle
extensive comments. It takes practice.
Structural Editing
When I receive an entire draft thesis to read, I ﬁrst look at the overall structure.
I skim the table of contents, for example, to check that it corresponds with the
chapter titles and main section headings in the text. It should tell me straight away
whether there are any major structural problems. If it is not informative enough,
I go to the beginning of each chapter and read the introductions in order. At this
stage, I am looking for logical links between each chapter, and then to see how
they come together as an overall argument.
After skimming the chapters, I then re-read the introductory chapter as if I were
a reader seeing it for the ﬁrst time. Thinking as an examiner, I ask myself: Is this
telling me (the uninformed reader) why the work is being done? Is it clear what the
aim of the work is? Is there an adequate sketch of how the writer intends to achieve
this aim? Is the scope of the thesis clearly delineated? Again, if any of these points
are inadequately covered, I note the problems in the margin. Then I go straight to
the conclusion, and ask myself whether it responds to the stated aim. Additionally,
I look over the reference section to see if major works are absent, and to get an
overall feel for the extent of literature that has been covered.
The Main Text
Next, I read the whole draft from beginning to end, noting spelling, grammar, and
typographical errors as I go, and also noting things such as obscurities, poor style,
81
From First to Second Draft

and places where the argument seems to have logic gaps. At the end of each
chapter I write a few lines about how the chapter shaped up in the context of
everything that preceded it. The summary of the chapter is particularly important
here. One of my most common comments on summaries is that the author has
written a list of the chapter contents, rather than giving me, the reader, a sense of
how the chapter has advanced my comprehension of the argument.
A related check at this stage is to see whether the text has ﬂow and motivation.
When I am reading, for example, an explanation of graphic design, I want to know
why it is there—how does it relate to the overall topic of bilingual advertising?
When I am reading a description of experimental apparatus, I want to know why
that apparatus was required, and what kinds of tests it is going to be used for. The
old adage is ‘tell the reader what you are going to say; then say it; then tell the
reader that you have said it’. Sometimes this is described as ‘make sure that every-
thing has a top and a tail’. At a coarse level, this is how a chapter is organized—the
introduction and summary provide motivation and context for the chapter’s con-
tents. The same principle should be applied at a more ﬁne-grained level, so that the
reader is never left wondering, for example, how a particular section or paragraph is
relevant to the rest of the thesis. While top-and-tailing can easily be overdone, it is a
critical tool for helping to ensure that the thesis has narrative ﬂow.
By the time I have reached the end of the thesis, a sense of the integrity (or lack
of it) of the whole document has usually built up. If there is a problem, it may be
obvious. If it is not obvious, I repeat the ﬁrst step—the examination of structure—
but now with an understanding of how the argument has developed, or has failed to
develop. There may be major gaps in the argument; there may be material present
that is not part of the argument and should be relegated to the appendices; there
may be repetitions that should be eliminated or consolidated; there may be material
that would have been better located elsewhere in the document; there may be con-
clusions emerging strongly at the end that the student should have emphasized
more, or had failed to argue for in the discussion, and so on. Before handing it back
to my student, I write comments on these larger problems.
Thus the student now has two sets of feedback: detailed comments in the text on
points of grammar and expression; and general comments about the structure of the
argument. We discuss the latter, and the student gets to work on the second draft.
As the student produces revisions of various parts aimed at solving particular pro-
blems, we review them. I usually ﬁnd that a complete re-reading of the second draft
is not necessary until after the more detailed part of the ﬁnishing process: revision.
Revising
Take the process of rewriting, and rethinking, seriously. Problems should be iden-
tiﬁed and ﬁxed, even if they are found at a very late stage in the writing process.
As I recommended earlier, there is much to be gained in writing the back-
ground before or during the time when you are carrying out your own research.
82
9
Before You Submit

However, when you have ﬁnished the research it is time to rewrite the back-
ground. You are now much clearer about several things than you were when you
ﬁrst wrote it:
• You understand the links between your work and the work of others.
• You now know what assumptions you made, perhaps unconsciously, about
your study area. These can now be made explicit.
• You are aware of the issues surrounding the application of current methods in
your ﬁeld, and have explicitly pointed out their limitations.
• You may have realized, perhaps with the help of feedback from your supervisor,
that you were making unwarranted assumptions about other people’s knowledge
of the background to your project.
• In your efforts to understand and interpret the results of your work, you will
have reached a new level of understanding of the work of others—this is what
is meant by a ‘critical’ understanding.
• You may have commenced your work without having developed a ﬁnal
version of your research questions. Check your wording again—and revise
accordingly.
Such issues provide insights into how you should revise the background
chapters:
• Ensure that the ways you are going to use words and ideas are carefully
deﬁned. Where these are fundamental to your work, the development of these
ideas in the literature, or even the history of ideas, must be discussed.
• Any formal literature review that you do at an early stage should not
appear in the ﬁnal thesis in that form. What you should have, rather, is a
structured account of the literature. You will be able to impose a struc-
ture on it, because by now you have largely ﬁnished your own work.
Additionally, ensure that the structure provides a ﬁrm basis for your discus-
sion chapter.
• Your thesis will include an appropriate formulation of your research questions
or hypotheses. You have to work back to where these questions or hypotheses
came from, and ensure that your background chapters prepared the way for
them.
• You have to be ready to cut material out of background chapters if it is not
used elsewhere in the thesis. The background chapters are not an end in them-
selves. They are merely the context for your project. Adopt a critical attitude,
and aim for concise writing. If you have material that is not being used as
either background to your work or context for the discussion of your results,
delete it.
Finally, be alert to getting ahead of yourself. You may have inadvertently put
work that is appropriate to one section in another, or forgotten to introduce a con-
cept that you later discuss in depth, or begun to report outcomes without realizing
it. Again, with a critical attitude, move or delete material from chapters when it
interrupts the logic of your overall argument.
83
Revising

Checking the Details
The ﬁnal step is to polish the text, and to check for any minor errors.
Although the second draft is now essentially complete, you still have some detailed,
rather tedious work to do. Don’t skip it—tedious or not, it is essential. The items that
you need to check are listed below. You may even want to photocopy this checklist
and tick the boxes when you have completed each task. If you have used your word-
processing software effectively, though, some of these will already have been done.
Your thesis may include text that you already regard as ‘ﬁnished’, such as
material drawn from reports that were written during your project; some depart-
ments, for example, ask all thesis students to write a separate literature review as
an intermediate goal. You may be surprised to ﬁnd how much change can be
required when such text is integrated into a thesis. Make sure that all of your text
is checked to the same level of detail.
Preliminary Pages
The ﬁrst few pages, before the start of Chapter 1, set the context of the thesis.
These initial pages will include some or all of the following items, generally in the
order given below:
Title Page
• Check that it contains title, author, place, month, and year, the degree for which
the thesis is submitted, and any task-speciﬁc requirements.
• Check that the title of the thesis accords with your aim. Two risks may arise
here: (a) You may be tempted to use an eye-catching title that could disorient the
examiners. This might make you feel pleased with yourself, but it is better to
make sure that your thesis passes! (b) The work is difﬁcult to search for future
researchers because the title contains obscure, or perhaps very common, terms.
• Check whether you are still using the title that you nominated at the start of
your project. Your initial aim will almost certainly have changed over the
course of the work, and you may need to realign the title accordingly.
Abstract
Include a brief synopsis of your work in a single paragraph that includes: (a) the
context and motivation of the problem, (b) the statement of the problem; (c) an
overview of methods and key results; and (d) signiﬁcant outcomes and implications.
Table of Contents
• List all chapter headings and headings of main sections within chapters. (Many
students also list subsection headings. I suggest that you don’t; they clutter up the
table of contents and weaken it as an explanation of the structure of your thesis.)
84
9
Before You Submit

• List all end matter (References, Appendices, and so on).
• Check the styles for table of contents entries, and change them if necessary to
make a neater, more informative table of contents. It’s a good idea to look over
several completed theses to see how other students have done this. Select for
yourself what works well, and avoid what doesn’t work.
• It is optional to include lists of ﬁgures and tables; these are not essential, but
are valuable in a thesis with a lot of technical material.
Preface and Acknowledgements
• A preface provides information about the preparation of the thesis that you feel
is necessary, for example to explain how you came to embark on the project.
Prefaces are seldom necessary for minor theses.
• Acknowledgements recognize help received in the execution of the research,
including funding and scholarships, and in the preparation of the thesis.
Declaration
• Most universities require certiﬁcation that the work in the thesis is your original
work, and has not been used for the award of any other degree.
• If you have published work from your thesis before the ﬁnal submission,
you must list complete references to such articles. You need to do this to
avoid possible accusations of ‘self-plagiarism’ or submission of work that
is not entirely original, and you will need to clearly identify the extent
to which the papers are your own work as distinct from that of your

If you have been following the methods I advocated in the preceding chapters,
everything in this checklist should already have been done. But do check. If you
have just picked this book up and have not been following my suggestions, use
this checklist, and if necessary go back and read the relevant chapter.
Aim and Scope
• Can the aim be located in the table of contents?
• Is the reason for doing the work outlined?
• Does the aim follow clearly from this problem statement or rationale?
• Are constraints stated that limit the scope of the investigation?
• Is the aim followed by a brief outline of the way you intend to go about achiev-
ing it? (This refers not only to the experiments, surveys or investigations that
you will design yourself, but to the whole of the project, including reviews of
theory and so on.)
• Do the conclusions you draw in the last chapter relate clearly to your aim?
85
Checking the Details

Background
• Do the introductions to chapters and sections clearly state their purpose?
• Is there any material in the background chapters that does not contribute
directly to the later development of the report or thesis? (If there is such mate-
rial, it should be relegated to the appendices, or omitted altogether.)
• Do the background chapters justify the formulation of the hypotheses or
research questions?
• If you are using a case-study approach, does the reason for selecting the case
study, and a description of it, appear among the background chapters?
(It should not, as it is part of your research method, and such material should
not be described until you have selected your method.)
• Similarly, have you explained your contribution in the background? (You
should not, as such material belongs later in the thesis.)
Design of Your Own Work
• Do your hypotheses or research questions arise logically from your reviews of
theory or practice, or from your preliminary surveys or experiments?
• Do you discuss the possible methods for enabling you to test your hypotheses
or answer your questions?
• Do you explicitly select a particular method or methods, and justify your selec-
tion through your review of other possible methods?
• Do you explicitly design experiments or other research programs to implement
the selected method or methods?
• Are tests for your hypotheses, or ways of investigating your questions, unequi-
vocally built into your research programs?
• Have you justiﬁed the selection of your data and method in terms of its repre-
sentativeness or typicality, or other appropriate criteria?
• If you have decided on a case-study approach, have you justiﬁed this decision
adequately?
• Unless offset by a colon and designated as such, does the name of the case
study appear in the title or aim of your thesis? (It should not. If it does, you
still have not sorted out the difference between a study of something in
its own right, and the use of a case study to investigate a broader
phenomenon.)
Results
• Are the results of your experiments or surveys or other own work clearly pre-
sented and explained?
• Are displays, such as graphs, table and ﬁgures, uniform in style and numbered?
• Are the major trends or ﬁndings outlined? (You should not be discussing the
implications of them while you are reporting them. For a short paper this might
be appropriate, but for a thesis keep them separate.)

Discussion
• Do you discuss your own ﬁndings in light of your overall purpose, the litera-
ture, and key ﬁndings, and then suggest implications for practice and an agenda
for further research?
• Does the discussion permit you come to a ﬁnal conclusion?
Conclusion
• Is your conclusion justiﬁed by the preceding discussion?
• Are you forming new points for discussion while drawing a conclusion? (You
should not be.)
• Does your conclusion respond to your aim, as set out in your ﬁrst chapter?
Format
Presentation varies widely from discipline to discipline, and you may have read
several sources that use a range of formats. With your supervisor, discuss a stan-
dard format and style for your area, and then ﬁnd a guidebook to help you to
present your work consistently. Many formatting conventions can be managed by
an effective use of a template, as discussed in Chap. 2.
Figures and Tables
Check all ﬁgures and tables. All must have a caption that consists of a title (which
will appear in the lists in the preliminary pages) and explanatory material that
draws attention to or explains certain features. If the work has been adopted from
a published source, you must provide an appropriate citation. You may have all
the ﬁgures, including graphs, diagrams, plates, photographs, and maps, together in
one list, and then all the tables in another; this would give you a ‘Table of
Figures’ and a ‘Table of Tables’. When evaluating a table or ﬁgure, ask:
• Does it add to your ability to give a piece of information, demonstrate a trend
or communicate an idea?
• Do important points emerge clearly?
• Does it, together with its caption, make sense by itself, or do readers have to
read the text to make sense of it? (They should not have to.)
• Do you draw attention to important points in the caption?
• Is there a reference to the ﬁgure in the text before the ﬁgure itself?
• Have you acknowledged the source or the information on which it is based?
• Have you identiﬁed examples of ‘good’ ﬁgures in other people’s work, and
applied the lessons to your own work?
87
Checking the Details

Any Graph (or Chart)
• Does it have both axes clearly labelled?
• Is the text legible?
• Are lines and other features appropriately labelled?
• Have you sought out and followed guidelines on design and preparation of
visual materials?
Any Table
• Have you arranged it in some way that makes it more than a collection of data?
Would the reader see patterns or trends? (There is no justiﬁcation for having
tables otherwise.)
• Is it vertically and horizontally consistent?
• Are there unnecessary lines?
• Are all rows and columns labelled?
• Have you considered relegating the data contained in it to an appendix, and
plotting the main trends as a graph?
Notes and References
If you have used the numbered notes system of references, use your word proces-
sor to automatically number or renumber notes. It will enable you to collect your
notes at the foot of each page or at the end of each chapter or at the end of the
main body of text (but collected separately for each chapter), before your
‘References’. Give your list a heading ‘Notes’, as a section-style heading if at the
end of each chapter, or a chapter-style heading if at the end of the text.
However, be sure to check some things:
• Re-read the notes to make sure that you have not accidentally deleted any, and
that you wish to keep the ones you have.
• Check whether you need to revise any notes in the light of revisions to the text.
Whichever reference system you use, include a full list of cited sources. The
list should be in alphabetical order of authors’ surnames, and should contain
sufﬁcient detail to enable the reader to ﬁnd the material. Check your list, particu-
larly if you are using bibliography management software or other automatic
tools:
• Is your reference list in alphabetical order?
• Do the entries conform to an established style? Use the preferred style for your
discipline and be consistent.
• Do all the references cited in the thesis appear in the reference list?

Before You Submit

Title this section ‘References’ in the style of a chapter heading. (To clarify: a
list of references contains only cited material, whereas a bibliography may contain
other material of interest. For a thesis, ‘References’ is preferable.)
Appendices
The purpose of appendices is to include, for the examiner, any material that may be
relevant to the overall research project (such as ethics clearances, data samples, or tran-
scripts) but does not directly contribute to the ﬂow and logic of an extended argument.
You need to justify why such material is needed by an examiner, and only
include it if it is indeed required.
• Is there a preamble that explains brieﬂy what its function is and what it is all about?
• Does the preamble refer to part of the main text? If it doesn’t, ﬁnd the part of
the text that it supports and make reference to it. If the appendix contains mate-
rial that is unnecessary, or provides little support for your argument, delete it.
Glossary
If you include a glossary, consult your discipline’s style guidelines to identify
where best to include it in your minor thesis.
And Don’t Forget …
Your thesis needs to consist of your work, not that of other people. All text that is
drawn from sources written by other people must be in quotes and fully acknowl-
edged with citations. Inclusion of anything that is copied, paraphrased, or edited
from the text of others without clear acknowledgement is plagiarism, and will lead
to serious consequences. Further, it is not acceptable to include excessive volumes
of text from other publications, even with acknowledgement.
If you have access to a tool for checking whether your text is original, use it. If
you have text that is drawn from anything that you have co-authored with other
people, make sure that they understand that it is being used in your thesis; you
may be expected to include a signed release form from all of these authors, so you
must check any requirements. Only include ﬁgures and tables if you have permis-
sion to do so; if you are not the author of a ﬁgure, you must ask the authors and

publisher if you can use it. If you are including material from papers you have
written, it should be material you were responsible for; if one of your co-authors
wrote a section without signiﬁcant input from you, then it should not become part
of your thesis.

Afterword
If we were asked to provide a single piece of advice to students writing their ﬁrst
thesis, it would be this: make a substantial time commitment to the project right
from the start. No matter how far away that submission deadline may seem, you will
have to learn many new skills before you ﬁnish, and you must work independently
and do a great deal of reading and writing, as well as analysing, revising, reworking,
and editing. Just about every thesis student regrets delays and procrastination.
To be successful, start writing early, take a professional approach to your pro-
ject, and actively seek to keep your overall argument on track. We recommend
that you don’t choose a topic (or supervisor) that is not a good ﬁt; work to a realis-
tic, detailed schedule that breaks the project down into small components; don’t
get distracted by short-term deadlines such as assignments; and don’t forget that
completing even a minor thesis—a step that allows you to join a community of
scholars—can be truly challenging.
Students who have done well in their coursework generally do well in their
minor theses, provided that they put in sufﬁcient effort. But there are exceptions,
and it would be a mistake to assume that, because you have been an outstanding
undergraduate student or have done well in your graduate coursework, a minor
thesis will be straightforward. The skills of coursework are different from those of
a minor thesis, and it is critical to recognize that you are taking on a new kind of
challenge—and so you need to be aware of the possibility of unexpected setbacks.
At the start of this book we introduced you to two minor thesis students. Both
Anouck and Mickey were slower to start than we would have liked, but managed
to catch up in the middle of their projects. Anouck in particular initially struggled
with the discipline of meeting milestones, but over the duration of the project she
developed a more mature approach to her commitments. Mickey consistently
worked hard, but also had to mature, in his case to become less sensitive when,
for example, he had misunderstood a task or needed to redraft some weak text.
They both ﬁnished well. Anouck went on to a PhD, while Mickey found a job at a
search engine company.

As a ﬁnal note, for many students, success in a minor thesis is transformative.
It gives them the conﬁdence to take on more ambitious goals, whether outside uni-
versity or in further study such as a PhD. Approach the thesis with an open,
enquiring mind; under take it with diligence; and thus complete what is often a
deeply satisfying experience. It is a pathway to joining a community of scholars
and to broad recognition for your intellectual accomplishments. Make the most of
the opportunity, make use of all the resources available to you, and look forward
to the completion of a rewarding achievement.
