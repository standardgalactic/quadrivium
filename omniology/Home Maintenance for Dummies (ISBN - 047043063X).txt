Dedication
Summer vacation had ended. It was my fi rst day back to school and my fi rst 
day as a sophomore. The morning air was warm, and I perspired as I anx-
iously rushed to chemistry class. I was excited and scared all at the same 
time. I shot into the room and made a beeline for a seat near the back wall. I 
slouched back in my seat in an attempt to appear relaxed. I wasn’t. Not even 
a little bit.
As I glanced up toward the front of the room, I caught a glimpse of her for the 
very fi rst time. Suddenly, the anxiety began to disappear. She had taken the 
fi rst seat in my row. The desks between us were still empty. She was wearing 
a tight, gray-wool, calf-length skirt and a satiny white blouse. Her hair was 
sandy colored and she wore it short. She was tall and slender. I hadn’t even 
seen her face, yet suddenly I knew that I had fallen in love. That was nearly 
40 years ago.
We grew up, and she became my best friend. She became a woman of charac-
ter and ambition. Even when she was a girl, she was wise and mature beyond 
her years. Yet, she has always been easygoing and fun to talk to. She is pas-
sionate about everything she does, and everything she does is tendered with 
great compassion. Our moments together are priceless pearls of happiness 
fi lled with mutual admiration and endearing love. In the morning, her smiling 
eyes get me going. In the evening, her calming voice puts me at ease. She is 
a loving mother, a sexy grandmother, and my partner in life. She is my wife, 
Carol.
Without her strength, this book would not have been possible. “Yo, Adrianne, 
Rocky loves ya baby!”
—Morris Carey
To Carol, my wife and partner for over 28 years: Thank you for the freedom, 
encouragement, and support to do my life’s work. I am so blessed to be your 
husband.
To Chris, Jamie, and Chase, our three beautiful children; Never take the roof 
over your head for granted. There are so many people in so many parts of the 
world, including our great country, who either don’t have adequate shelter or 
are without the means to maintain it so that it is both safe and sound. Always 
work hard to be good citizens and contribute to the betterment of society. 
Love, Dad.
—James Carey

Authors’ Acknowledgments
We were thrilled when the folks at Wiley engaged us to give Home 
Maintenance For Dummies a new lease on literary life. We are delighted that 
the book has done so well in the nearly ten years since the publication of the 
fi rst edition and we hope that this second edition will be equally popular and 
act as a valuable resource for people looking for help in maintaining their 
piece of the Great American Dream.
As we write this book, millions of Americans are struggling to survive one of 
the toughest economic times in modern history — certainly in our lifetimes. 
We hope that our book will, in some small way, help relieve some of the 
economic stress that you may be feeling when it comes to your home and 
its maintenance by empowering you to take on tasks that you might have 
previously, during more prosperous times, farmed out to a contractor or 
handyperson. If this is true, than our greatest hopes and dreams will have 
been satisfi ed.
There are many people who contributed both directly and indirectly to the 
success of this book. Although there are too many to list, we would be remiss 
without naming a few.
This second edition would literally have taken forever — certainly longer 
than our publisher would allow — had it not been for some very valuable 
writing assistance that we received from Tim Green and Tracy L. Barr. Tim, 
our longtime friend and a stellar writer, is an obedient husband, a loving 
father, and a frustrated do-it-yourselfer. He injects his unique perspective, 
which add both color and humor to this body of work. We were introduced 
to Tracy by the Wiley folks. She is a very talented writer and editor who has 
authored or coauthored several For Dummies books, including Living Well in 
a Down Economy For Dummies, to which we contributed. She did a marvel-
ous job of helping us organize and prioritize content and was a pleasure with 
which to work. Thanks to you both for helping us make this book the best 
that it can be.
At Wiley, we want to thank Diane Graves Steele and Tracy Boggier for believ-
ing in this project and for giving us yet another opportunity to share the 
better part of our lives’ work with you. A special thanks goes to our project 
editor, Elizabeth Kuball. This is our fi rst opportunity to have had the plea-
sure of working with Elizabeth. She worked tirelessly to ensure that the 
second edition would contain the best of the fi rst edition with lots of new and 
exciting material. We sincerely hope that she again will have the opportunity 
to transform our journalism into a fi nished project that is both professional 
and easy to understand and of which we are very proud.

Introduction
I
n our first For Dummies project — Home Remodeling For Dummies — we 
ventured with our readers down the sometimes rocky road of remodeling 
a home. Our goal was to prepare people for the many steps and potential pit-
falls involved in planning and executing a home-remodeling project, regard-
less of its size or complexity. Throughout that book, “plan, plan, plan” was 
our mantra.
For this, our most recent offering, we’ve adopted an old cliché as our credo. 
In fact, had this not been a part of the best-selling For Dummies series, a more 
apt title may have been An Ounce of Prevention Is Worth a Pound of Cure. 
On the other hand, Home Maintenance For Dummies, 2nd Edition, does have 
a nice ring to it! What’s more, chances are good that by the time you’ve had 
a chance to sink your teeth into this book, you’ll be anything but a dummy 
when it comes to maintaining your home.
Your home is probably the largest investment that you’ll make in your life-
time. So, it makes good sense to do everything that you can to protect that 
investment from deterioration caused by the forces of nature, wood-eating 
pests, and good, old-fashioned wear and tear. As you’ll soon read, in addition 
to protecting the structural integrity of your home, regular maintenance will 
make it more comfortable, safer, and more energy efficient. And don’t forget 
that a well cared-for home stands out in the neighborhood, and that’s worth 
something — a bigger price tag when it comes time to sell, or simply the sat-
isfaction of knowing that you’re in charge of your home and not vice versa.
Few undertakings offer the pride and personal satisfaction that a home-main-
tenance job done well can. Home Maintenance For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is 
so full of information on how to care for your home, we guarantee that your 
cup of pride and personal satisfaction will forever runneth over.
Finally, if we’ve met our objective, your reading will be peppered with lots of 
laughter. Enjoy!
About This Book
Like most For Dummies books, Home Maintenance For Dummies, 2nd Edition, 
is a reference, meaning that it was written with the expectation that you 
would not read it from cover to cover over a couple of sittings. Instead, we 

2
Home Maintenance For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
think that you’ll consider it one of the most important reference tools in your 
home-maintenance arsenal — like your prized hammer or wrench that you 
pick up and use whenever necessary.
Each chapter is divided into sections, and each section offers instructions on 
some home maintenance task, like
 
✓ How to fix those pesky floor squeaks
 
✓ What to do when you know you’ve got a leak but you don’t know where 
it’s coming from
 
✓ What cleaning solution is the best for removing mildew
 
✓ How to easily maintain those confusing machines that keep you comfort-
able, like your furnace, boiler, air conditioner, and water heater
 
✓ How to prevent a flooded basement and how to fix it if your last fix 
didn’t work
 
✓ How to reduce your energy costs while improving your comfort — all in 
one fell swoop
 
✓ How to decide whether to do it yourself or hire a contractor
Who needs this book? Everyone — unless you’re independently wealthy and 
you have no intention of lifting a finger to care for your home. Even then, this 
book could prove to be valuable. Who knows? You might just find it handy in 
rescuing one of your loyal servants. Seriously, if your home is an apartment, 
condo, single-family house, flat, co-op, cave, or hut; if you rent, own, or borrow; 
if your habitat is old, new, or somewhere in between, this book is for you.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate through this book and make maintenance as easy as 
possible, we’ve set up a few conventions:
 
✓ We use italics for emphasis and to highlight new words or terms that we 
define.
 
✓ We use boldface to indicate the actionable part of numbered steps.
 
✓ We use monofont for Web addresses and e-mail addresses.
In addition to these standard conventions, whenever a task takes more than a 
few tools, we provide a list so that you can gather everything you need before 
you start to work.

 Introduction
What You’re Not to Read
We’ve written this book so that you can find information easily and easily 
understand what you find. And although we’d like to believe that you want 
to pore over every last word between the two yellow-and-black covers, we 
actually make it easy for you to identify skippable material — the stuff that, 
although interesting and related to the topic at hand, isn’t essential for you to 
know. This text appears in sidebars, which are the shaded boxes that appear 
here and there throughout the book. They share personal stories and obser-
vations, but they aren’t necessary reading.
Foolish Assumptions
You know what they say about the word assume. In any event, we’ve made 
the following assumptions about you:
 
✓ You care about the appearance and condition of your home and, hence, 
its value.
 
✓ You’re not a home-improvement fanatic, nor are you particularly handy — 
you don’t need to be.
 
✓ You have a song in your heart, a smile on your face, and an insatiable 
desire to see your home be the best that it can be.
 
✓ You don’t have a warehouse full of tools and you’re interested in getting 
only what you need. A few tools are of infinite value when it comes to 
home maintenance. However, the most complicated tool that you’ll need 
is a cordless driver drill for sinking a screw here and there. The tools 
that you’ll find yourself needing most often are a scrub brush, a paint-
brush, and plenty of patience.
 
✓ You’re the type who always seeks help when needed and always puts 
safety first when attempting a home-maintenance endeavor.
How This Book Is Organized
The chapters of this book are divided into the following parts so that you can 
easily find just the information that you’re looking for.

4
Home Maintenance For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
Part I: Home Maintenance and You
This part introduces you to the benefits of home maintenance and to the 
major systems and components in your home. You can also find a series of 
lists to help you keep your home-maintenance tasks organized. Follow this 
schedule, and your home will love you for it.
Even though you don’t have to read this book from cover to cover, we 
strongly recommend that you check out the three chapters in this part so 
that you have a clear understanding of what parts of your home require main-
tenance and why you should pay attention to them.
Part II: The Energy Envelope
Your home’s envelope consists of all its exterior surfaces and associated 
components like windows and doors. And don’t forget the attic, roof, base-
ment, and foundation. To be comfortable inside your home, its exterior must 
be in secure and sound condition. Turn to this part to discover how easily 
you can maintain your home’s exterior.
Part III: Key Systems: 
Plumbing and HVAC
Nothing is scarier than hearing a noise that wasn’t there before emanating 
from mechanical equipment: a popping sound in the water heater, a faucet 
that suddenly sounds like it’s running on a flat tire, or a screeching racket 
inside the deepest, darkest part of your furnace. If you want to prevent or 
repair these elements of your home, check out this part.
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home
This part contains information on the stuff that you come into contact with 
on a day-to-day basis within your home, such as the walls, ceilings, floors, 
interior doors, cabinets, countertops, and appliances, to name a few. If you 
never venture into another part of this book, and you accomplish a majority 
of the tasks contained in this part, you’ll be light-years ahead of the home-
maintenance curve. Part IV helps you patch walls, quiet floors, unstick doors, 

5
 Introduction
cure cabinet woes, and fix fireplaces. And, as an added bonus, we tell you 
how to keep your home and yourself safe and secure. If this book could be 
compared to a meal, this part would definitely be the main course.
Part V: Out in the Great Wide Open
If Part IV contains all the stuff that you see everyday in your home, Part V 
is all about what you (and others) can see outside your home, such as walk-
ways, paths, patios, decks, and driveways. Think that the interior of your 
home takes a beating? Consider the abuse that your wood deck, concrete 
patio, or metal porch railing is subject to from constant exposure to sunlight, 
rain, wind, and snow. Wood oxidizes, cups, and cracks; concrete expands, 
contracts, chips, and cracks; and metal can become a full-blown science 
experiment when covered with rust. Fortunately, Part V is chock-full of 
money-saving and time-tested tips and recipes that will tame even the most 
ferocious home-maintenance predator in your great wide open.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
In this part, you find ten cleaning solutions you can make yourself. Not only 
will these recipes save you all kinds of money, but you’ll actually know what’s 
in the products you’re using. We also tell you the ten home-maintenance 
skills you need to keep your home in tip-top shape.
Icons Used in This Book
Some information in this book is so important that we want to emphasize it 
by placing little pictures (called icons) next to certain points. Here’s what the 
icons mean:
 
When we feel like telling you a little story, you’ll see this icon.
 
We use this icon to highlight products that we’ve come to know and trust over 
the years.

6
Home Maintenance For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
 
This icon flags text that’s important and not to be forgotten.
 
When we go out on a limb to suggest something you should do, we use this 
icon. It represents your basic good idea.
 
We use this icon to steer you clear of things that we don’t want you to do. It 
points out dangers and health hazards you should be aware of.
Where to Go from Here
This book is organized so that you can go wherever you want to find com-
plete information. Got a problem with your siding? Head to Chapter 5. Need 
to replace a toilet? Chapter 8 is for you. If you’re not sure where you want 
to go, you may want to start with Part I — it gives you all the basic info 
you need, including vital safety guidelines and a home-maintenance plan to 
follow; plus, it points you to places where you can find more detailed infor-
mation. You can also use the index to look up specific topics or the table of 
contents for broader categories. Or simply let your fingers do the walking 
until you find a topic that inspires you and let the games begin! This book 
makes for great armor — just don’t get it wet!

Maintenance 
and You

In this part . . .
E
veryone knows that a bit of caulking or a coat of 
paint can make a home look better. What many folks 
don’t know is that beauty isn’t only skin deep. Both of 
these maintenance tasks, like most maintenance tasks, do 
much more than meets the eye.
In this part, we help you see beyond the obvious and 
show you what to look for when it comes to keeping your 
home fit. We also provide a home-maintenance schedule 
that suggests what you should do and when you should 
do it. Consider this a gentle reminder or two, or three. . . .

Chapter 1
Home Maintenance: What It Is 
and Why It Matters
In This Chapter
▶ Making your home a safer and more comfortable place to live
▶ Enhancing your home’s value
▶ Saving money on repairs and energy
W
e grew up in house that was built by our grandfather shortly after 
the turn of the 20th century. Our family (all six of us) continually 
did maintenance on that house — painting, plastering, plumbing, repairing 
window screens, and a billion other tasks. Or so it seemed.
However, maintenance is not reserved for older homes. Home maintenance 
should begin the day the house is completed, and continue for as long as 
the structure exists. But please don’t think that you’ve signed up for years of 
drudgery. In this chapter, we show you how home maintenance can be fast, 
easy, and even fun — and how it can save you money in the long run.
Keeping Up with Upkeep
Some homeowners think of maintenance as a challenge, something to take 
on, overcome, and, with luck, complete. Some see it as a learning experi-
ence, looking to master new skills, and, in the process, improve their home. 
Some get into the Zen of it, finding enlightenment in knowing — and truly 
understanding — the inner workings of their dwellings. And some focus on 
the bottom line, seeing maintenance as the preservation and enhancement 
of their huge home investment. Most just want their homes to look nice and 
work well.

10
Part I: Home Maintenance and You 
However you approach maintenance (and regardless of whether you achieve 
insight into the meaning of your existence), you have to stay on top of your 
to-do list, because you need to keep little problems from becoming big trou-
ble, because it’s smart to keep everything looking good, and because keeping 
your home’s systems working efficiently makes financial sense.
From little to big
Maintenance is not about big, time-consuming, and expensive projects. In 
fact, one of the most effective and worthwhile tasks — painting a room — 
requires only a couple of gallons of paint, a $10 brush, and a $3 roller cover. 
Changing the furnace filter takes two minutes. Caulking a drafty window 
frame is a five-minute, $5 job. Doing these little things, and doing them con-
tinuously or as needed, makes a huge difference in the appearance, comfort, 
and efficiency of your home.
Over time, there will be more little projects than big ones. Our advice: Do 
the little ones yourself. Most of them are easy to do. You’ll save money, your 
home will look and work better, and you’ll feel as though you’ve accom-
plished something.
Medium-size projects — like cleaning and adjusting your furnace, adjusting 
a sticking exterior door, or replacing a toilet — need to be evaluated on a 
case-by-case basis. To decide whether to do them yourself or hire a pro, ask 
yourself these questions:
 
✓ Do I have the right skills and knowledge?
 
✓ Do I have the necessary tools?
 
✓ Do I have the time?
If you have to say no to any one of these questions, you need to think hard 
before taking on the job. You may be better off hiring a pro.
Which brings us to the big projects, things like replacing the roof, re-siding, 
and pouring a new driveway. Unless you have some really awesome skills, 
solid experience, and know-how, as well as a workshop full of tools, hiring 
a pro is best. As a friend of ours says, “I know how to build a deck. But I’ve 
never done it before. There are people who build decks every day, people 
who know how to do the job right. It’s worth the cost of hiring a contractor to 
be satisfied with the end product.”
Many of our radio-show callers are homeowners who’ve taken on projects 
that are way beyond their expertise, require the purchase of expensive tools, 

11
 Chapter 1: Home Maintenance: What It Is and Why It Matters
and are taking much longer than expected. And they’re not calling to share 
how wonderful the projects have gone. They need help putting things back 
together or advice on how to find someone who can get the monkeys off 
their backs, so to speak. Don’t get caught in this trap. Be smart. Know your 
limitations.
All the chapters in Parts II through V contain many of the most common 
small and medium-size maintenance tasks that you can tackle yourself (with 
our help, of course). And when a task really should be left to a pro, we tell 
you that, too.
From inside to outside
Homes are complicated. They have many components and systems that need 
to be monitored and maintained (see Chapter 2). Inside, the systems include 
plumbing, electrical, and heating/air conditioning. Plus, you’ve got the foun-
dation, structural framing, walls, floors, appliances, countertops, cabinets, 
sinks, bathtubs, fireplaces, and more to care for. It sounds like a lot (and it 
is), but you can find all the details you need in Parts II, III, and IV.
Outside, the components that require attention include windows and doors, 
roof, chimney, garage door, concrete, masonry, and siding. The key thing to 
know about problems on the outside of your home is that, if you don’t attend 
to them, they can become problems on the inside, too. That’s why we devote 
an entire part (Part V) to helping you prevent and address problems outside.
Benefiting from a Little TLC
There are five major benefits to maintaining your home well:
 
✓ Improved safety
 
✓ Increased comfort
 
✓ Enhanced home value
 
✓ Money savings
 
✓ Energy efficiency
Here’s what this list tells you: that home maintenance literally pays off. To 
put it another way, these five big benefits prove that an ounce of prevention 
really is worth a pound of cure. And, as you’ll soon discover, those are words 
to live by when it comes to your home.

12
Part I: Home Maintenance and You 
To your health (and safety)
A poorly cared-for home is not just an aesthetic problem — it can hurt you:
 
✓ A rotted subfloor can result in an unexpected visit to the floor below — 
complete with bumps, cuts, bruises, and maybe a trip to the hospital.
 
✓ A poorly maintained furnace can leak deadly carbon monoxide gas, 
which is the leading cause of poisoning deaths in the United States.
 
✓ An air-conditioning system that fails in the heat of summer, or a furnace 
that takes a hiatus in the worst of winter, can lead to extreme indoor 
temperatures, which can be dangerous, or even fatal for the elderly and 
very young.
 
✓ A smoke detector with a dead battery doesn’t work — it’s literally play-
ing with fire.
Simple home maintenance can prevent these disasters and make your house 
a safer place to live for you and your family. For example, the one 9-volt bat-
tery, vacuuming, and three minutes that it takes to maintain your smoke 
detector could prevent you from losing your home, a pet, or a loved one.
So how do you spell safety when it comes to your home? M-A-I-N-T-E-N-A-N-C-E!
Comfort: You’ll miss it if it’s gone
Your house contains a number of systems that make it a comfortable place to 
live (see Chapter 2). Most people take the comfort systems in their house for 
granted. They don’t think about them until one of the systems breaks down. 
And then the result is a distinct lack of comfort.
You get what you pay for
Here’s the first rule of home-maintenance mate-
rials: Buy the best that you can afford. Doing so 
gives your home the maximum benefit and pro-
tection. If you buy inferior materials, you’ll likely 
be doing the job over again soon. Worse yet, 
you may end up spending a hefty sum to make 
repairs that otherwise wouldn’t be needed had 
you spent a little more upfront. Not a bad propo-
sition if you enjoy spending all your free time 
and spare change fixing up your home.

13
 Chapter 1: Home Maintenance: What It Is and Why It Matters
For example, your home’s electrical system powers lights, your refrigerator, 
your water heater, and your washer and dryer, among other things. You may 
not think about your electrical system when you turn on lights; grab a cold 
can of soda from the fridge; take a hot, relaxing shower; or fold your freshly 
laundered clothes. But if that electrical system breaks down, you’ll quickly 
realize how much of your day-to-day comfort depends on it.
Because many of these systems have motors and moving parts, they’re espe-
cially vulnerable to wear and tear that, without preventive maintenance, could 
result in major inconvenience — and, at least at our houses, lots of swearing.
Money in the bank
Preventing a problem is almost always cheaper than making repairs after 
a problem occurs. And it’s always less expensive to fix a little problem 
before it becomes big trouble. Use this as your home-maintenance mantra: 
“Ommmmm, smart homeowners are proactive, ommmmmm.”
Avoiding more expensive repairs
Here’s how the ounce-of-prevention thing works: The metal flashing that sur-
rounds a chimney can be the source of a nasty roof leak if it’s not maintained. 
The $20 it costs to caulk and paint the flashing is a fraction of the hundreds 
or thousands of dollars you would spend to repair water damage to ceilings, 
walls, and flooring. We bet you can’t find a blue-chip stock that pays those 
kinds of dividends! Ka-ching!
Gaps in siding and trim around windows and doors allow cold drafts and 
moisture to make their way into the wood skeleton of your home. Aside from 
driving up utility bills, the moisture produces rot that, in turn, weakens the 
structural elements in your home, and provides a veritable smorgasbord for 
structural pests like termites and other wood ravagers, as well as creating 
a breeding ground for dangerous mold. These small gaps can result in thou-
sands of dollars’ worth of repairs and, if left unrepaired long enough, can 
actually lead to the demise of your home. The flip side: Spend five minutes 
and $5 to caulk the trim around a window. Your home will love you for it, and 
you’ll love yourself for saving so much of your hard-earned cash.
Increasing efficiency
Most people know that the more efficiently a mechanical device works, the less 
it costs to operate. A well-tuned automobile engine, for example, delivers far 

14
Part I: Home Maintenance and You 
better fuel efficiency than a clunker. The same holds true with many of the 
machines that you have around your home. Your furnace is a great example. 
A clean furnace filter, coupled with other preventive maintenance tasks, 
makes the furnace operate more efficiently, consuming less energy and 
making it less susceptible to breakdowns.
Energy savings equal money savings. Keeping the appliances in your home 
running efficiently also helps the environment — a major benefit for yourself 
and the planet.
Many times, improving efficiency requires the replacement of the system or 
appliance in question. A brand-new refrigerator is twice as efficient as one 
just 7 years old. A new water heater is significantly cheaper to operate than 
the one in your basement. (A tankless water heater is more efficient still.) 
Your 10-year-old air-conditioning system? Terribly wasteful! New ones must 
meet significantly tougher efficiency standards. The repair-versus-replace 
decision is complicated when it comes to appliances and energy-consuming 
systems. You need to consider whether it’s worth repairing an old, inefficient 
unit and whether (and how long it will take) for the new one to pay for itself.
Roots: A good place to begin
Before there were the Carey brothers (or Carey 
sisters — there are two), there were the Carey 
parents: Morris and Alvera. We can attribute 
our interest in building, remodeling, and repair 
to our parents — a couple of dyed-in-the-wool 
do-it-yourselfers. Both gone now, they made 
one heck of a home-improvement and -repair 
team. They were hard working, creative, and 
industrious. If ever a sow’s ear could be turned 
into a silk purse, Mom and Dad could do it.
Mom’s favorite source for sprucing up the 
home was the local thrift shop, while the local 
landfill — we called them dumps back then — 
was Dad’s hangout. After any given shopping 
spree, Mom would return home with unusual 
items, such as an old, metal milk can, an assort-
ment of picture frames, and a light fixture or two. 
Armed only with her innate creativity and her 
infamous gold spray paint, she would convert 
trash into family treasures. The milk can became 
a lamp, the ailing frames were transformed into 
sought-after antiques, and the light fixtures 
would rival those of Liberace. What they all had 
in common was their radiant gold finish, her 
trademark.
Meanwhile, Dad would be pulling an old piece of 
furniture off his truck that he “rescued” from the 
local landfill. His favorites were old console radios 
and television sets. Once, Dad took a vintage radio 
cabinet, tore out all the guts, and transformed 
it into an elegant glass cabinet that Mom used to 
showcase all her fine crystal and china. The hinged 
top that once served as the hatch to a turntable 
allowed convenient access to her treasures.
Be it painting, plastering, or plumbing, there was 
always something that needed to be done 
around our house. With some ingenuity, our par-
ents showed us that these tasks could be fun. 
And that’s something we want to show you, too.

 Chapter 1: Home Maintenance: What It Is and Why It Matters
Maintaining and increasing your home’s value
If you’re like most people, your home is the single largest investment of 
your lifetime. Besides having a place to live, you may have also made this 
investment with the hopes of making some money on it when you sell the 
house. Thus, it makes good sense (and big bucks) to keep your home in 
tip-top shape.
We learned a valuable term from real-estate professionals whom we encoun-
tered over the years in our building and remodeling business: curb appeal. 
This term refers to how the outward appearance of a home affects its value. 
A home with a roof, windows, doors, siding, fencing, and landscaping that are 
well cared for is more appealing to potential buyers and, hence, more valu-
able. Conversely, a poorly maintained home can be a real eyesore and worth 
significantly less than its well-maintained counterpart.
Even if you don’t intend to sell your home in the near future, you need to 
maintain your home in order to maintain your initial investment. We’ve 
probably beat this message into the ground already, but simple repairs, like 
replacing a furnace filter, can make a big difference in maintaining this invest-
ment. How, you ask, can a home’s value be affected by replacing a furnace 
filter? Seem like a stretch? Not in the slightest. With a clean filter, a furnace 
doesn’t work nearly as hard; thus, it places less stress on the motor, fan belt, 
and other components. Consequently, the furnace has a longer life, and, in 
turn, you avoid having to replace the furnace prematurely.
Let the Games Begin!
Now that you have an idea of what it is about your home that needs to be 
maintained and why it’s important to do so, you can use the information in 
this book to charge forward to tackle projects that have been on your to-do 
list. Keep in mind that, when it comes to project order, you should crawl 
before you walk and walk before you run. So as not to become discouraged 
or end up with a mess on your hands, we suggest that you attempt smaller, 
more doable projects first. This approach gives you the opportunity to get 
comfortable using tools and materials that may not be so familiar.
 
Safety first! Always have the right tools and equipment for the job and never 
be in a hurry. Haste makes waste and is a recipe for potential injury and poor 
results. We suggest that you have a look at Chapter 3 for suggestions on what 
projects to take on first and the basic tools that you’ll need to accomplish 
most home-maintenance projects. Start with small projects and work your 
way up the ladder — literally and figuratively — to more-complex projects.

With time and experience, you’ll grow increasingly more comfortable and con-
fident wielding a hammer in one hand and a caulking gun in the other.
When all’s said and done, the idea is to protect your home, save money, and 
have fun in the process. Who knows? You may just find that you like this 
home maintenance stuff. Yippee!

Chapter 2
Getting to Know Your House 
and Its Systems
In This Chapter
▶ Getting an overview of your home and its important parts
▶ Looking at the common maintenance tasks for each part of the home
H
ome maintenance reminds us a lot of the Monopoly board game. Both 
involve a bit of a gamble with real estate. In the game, dice decide your 
destiny. A favorable roll can turn you into a real-estate baron with holdings 
that rival those of Donald Trump. On the other hand, the wrong combination 
can land you straight in the pokey!
Each time you postpone a maintenance task, you’re rolling the dice with your 
home’s structural and aesthetic integrity and value. Plus, although it isn’t 
very likely that failing to keep up your home will have you doing the jailhouse 
rock, sadly, there are occasions when such negligence can result in tremen-
dous damage for which you can conceivably be held liable — not to mention 
the personal loss that you can suffer.
In this chapter, we show you that your home is more than just four walls and a 
roof; your house is actually made up of a group of systems and fixtures, all of 
which need your loving care and attention from time to time. We introduce you 
to each of these systems, which we examine in great detail throughout this book.
The Exterior: It’s Nice to 
Fool Mother Nature
Every area of a home needs ongoing maintenance, but some areas require 
more care than others. At the top of the “needy” list is a home’s exterior. The 
exterior is subject to constant deterioration thanks to the forces of Mother 

18
Part I: Home Maintenance and You 
Nature — the sun, wind, and rain. Consequently, it’s no accident that you 
may find yourself spending a majority of your home-maintenance time on the 
exterior.
The following sections discuss the elements of a home’s exterior that will, 
from time to time, require maintenance.
Your home’s infrastructure: The foundation 
and floor frame
The foundation, which we discuss in detail in Chapter 4, is a key component 
of a home’s infrastructure. The other key component of the infrastructure is 
the floor frame, also covered in detail in Chapter 4. Together these two sup-
port the walls, roof, and other structural elements of your home.
The foundation
Your home’s foundation, whether it’s a basement, a crawlspace, or a concrete 
slab, is the element of construction that helps a home stay put. A level foun-
dation can usually contribute to a level floor, windows and doors that oper-
ate smoothly, and the absence of cracks in walls and ceilings. For homes with 
basements, the foundation also holds back earth and limits the intrusion of 
unwanted water.
Checking cracks before they spread and dealing with moisture control are 
among the most common maintenance tasks associated with a foundation.
The floor frame
The floor frame consists of floor joists and/or girders (beams) and the sub-
floor. The joists and girders travel horizontally and rest on the foundation. 
The subfloor consists of lumber or plywood that’s fastened to the floor fram-
ing. Finish flooring (carpet, vinyl, hardwood, and so on) is installed above the 
subfloor.
The floor frame is notorious for the maddening creaks and squeaks that 
occur when traipsing across it. Aside from the fact that floor squeaks can 
drive you nuts, they’re considered a sign of inferior construction, which can 
lower your home’s perceived value. Although this can be true, the reality is 
that even the best-built homes can suffer from a squeak now and again. Thus, 
silencing squeaks is the most common maintenance task when it comes to 
the floor frame. Not far behind are preventing rot and leveling up an out-of-
level floor before it damages the structure of the entire home. You can find all 
the information you need in Chapter 4.

19
 Chapter 2: Getting to Know Your House and Its Systems
Roofing and siding: Your home’s 
protective coat
Most people think of siding as either vinyl or wood, but we use the term to 
describe a wider class of materials — whatever can be used as a finished, 
protective coat on the exterior walls of your home, such as brick, wood, 
vinyl, stucco, aluminum, or a composite siding.
Siding is, by design, expected to endure forces that simply aren’t an issue 
with interior walls. In the children’s story “The Three Little Pigs,” the Big Bad 
Wolf didn’t have a chance of blowing down the house with the brick walls. 
What the story failed to mention was that the Little Pig who lived in the 
house with brick walls made sure to keep the mortar joints in good condition, 
the brick well sealed, and all the gaps caulked.
Take a lesson from this smart Little Pig and follow the maintenance routines 
suggested in Chapter 5 for your siding. You’ll discover that exterior wall 
maintenance is all about preserving the integrity of the siding.
We think of the roof as the fifth wall of the house. Because the roof is a hori-
zontal surface, it’s subject to all the same forces that siding is, and then 
some. Like siding, rain and sun are a roof’s biggest enemies. Maintenance on 
your roof isn’t much different from what you do to maintain your siding. So, 
we combine roofing and siding in Chapter 5.
Keeping a roof clean is one of the most important maintenance tasks. A 
debris-free roof improves watershed and prevents rot, mold, and fungus 
growth. Metal flashing at vents, chimneys, skylights, valleys, and other 
critical areas are most prone to leak, which requires special care. And 
although not officially a part of the roof, gutters and downspouts are essen-
tial to proper watershed and, when well maintained, can prevent everything 
from a roof leak to sticking windows and doors. Cleaning, caulking, and 
painting count among the most common gutter- and spout-related mainte-
nance tasks.
Windows, exterior doors, and insulation
Without a doubt, windows and doors are two of the most important elements 
of a home. They give you access to the outdoors and, when armed with a key, 
access to the indoors! Windows and doors also provide natural light and ven-
tilation — two of the most valuable commodities a home can have.

20
Part I: Home Maintenance and You 
Windows and doors
Unfortunately, windows and doors are frequently among the most maintenance-
intense elements, primarily because, unlike siding and roofing, windows and 
doors have moving parts that suffer from wear and tear. What’s more, in most 
homes, windows and doors are also responsible for the majority of energy loss.
Water leaks, air leaks, and condensation are a few of the most common 
window-related maintenance issues. As for doors, a touch of lubrication to 
hinges and hardware, shimming a hinge, and adjusting a strike plate or door 
bottom can be the saving grace to any door.
Chapter 6 offers tips on these window- and door-maintenance tasks.
 
An out-of-level floor can make doors and windows tough to operate and can 
be the cause of cracks in walls over windows and doors. If you’re tired of 
patching cracks and wrestling with doors and windows, head to Chapter 4. 
Out-of-level floors have virtually nothing to do with the floor itself and almost 
everything to do with the foundation and soil that support it.
Insulation
Insulation is like a nice, warm blanket on a cold winter’s night. It can make all 
the difference when it comes to comfort and energy efficiency. Insulation can 
Keeping your eye on the doughnut
Although we were born 12 years apart, we 
shared many of the same teachers throughout 
school. One teacher who has a special place in 
both our hearts is Mrs. Roxie Gibbs. Mrs. Gibbs 
was our high school English and journalism 
teacher. She was your classic eyeglasses-slid-
ing-down-the-nose, beehive-coifed, mid-length-
skirted, prim-and-proper schoolmarm straight 
out of Little House on the Prairie.
One of Mrs. Gibbs’s favorite adages was “Keep 
your eye upon the doughnut and not upon the 
hole.” Although these words were initially a total 
mystery to us, we eventually discovered their 
meaning. What Mrs. Gibbs was so eloquently 
stating was to focus on the issue (the doughnut) 
and not the minutiae (the hole). What does this 
have to do with home maintenance? Plenty!
When dealing with home maintenance, con-
centrate on the root of a problem (the doughnut) 
instead of focusing on the symptom (the hole). 
For example, people often ask us how to keep a 
door from sticking. A door sticks for one reason 
and one reason only: The uniform gap between 
the door and the frame no longer exists. The 
gap (which should have been there at installa-
tion) allows the door to be opened and closed 
without interference from the frame.
The sticking door is a symptom of a larger 
problem, like an out-of-level floor. Accordingly, 
we don’t want you to be stuck on the stick — 
rather, we want you to chew on what causes 
the door to stick. Are we making ourselves 
clear, or are you stuck? (Chapter 6 tells you all 
about unsticking stuck doors.)

21
 Chapter 2: Getting to Know Your House and Its Systems
typically be found in the attic, exterior walls, and floors above crawlspaces 
and basements. There are all kinds of insulation, ranging from treated paper 
to fiberglass. Over time, insulation can settle, becoming more compact and 
less effective. That’s the bad news. The good news is that in Chapter 7 we 
show you what you can do about it.
Walkways, patios, and driveways
Walks and patios are to a home’s exterior what halls and entertaining areas 
are to a home’s interior. Can you imagine directing a houseguest down a hall 
with an uneven walking surface or trying to entertain a group of people in a 
room with chunks of carpet, tile, or hardwood missing? Doing so would inevi-
tably result in a twisted ankle or a nasty fall — talk about putting a damper 
on a party! Why, then, would you be any less attentive to the condition of the 
walking and entertaining surfaces outside your home?
In the grand scheme of things, chances are good that the walks, paths, and 
patios that surround your home are subject to as much traffic as, or more 
traffic than, many spaces within your home. In addition to the safety aspects, 
these and other paved areas, such as a driveway or carport, can have a tre-
mendous influence on the overall appearance (the “curb appeal”) of your 
home. Accordingly, they should be given the same degree of attention when it 
comes to home maintenance.
Paths, patios, and other paved areas typically consist of concrete, brick, 
stone, or asphalt. None of these materials is immune to the need for periodic 
maintenance. Uneven surfaces, cracks of varying proportion, potholes, 
and staining are conditions that cry out for attention. Ironically, the need 
for many of these repairs can be prevented down the road with ongoing 
maintenance. For example, a driveway remains more resilient and water-
resistant and, hence, is less likely to crack when a sealer is periodically 
applied.
If your driveway looks like an Indy 500 pit stop or your front walk looks like 
the San Andreas Fault, you can clean ’em, patch ’em, seal ’em, or even stain 
or paint ’em using the information found in Chapter 17.
Decks
Depending on what kind of deck you have — on grade or on the roof — the 
surface can consist of wood, vinyl, a composite, concrete, tile, roofing mate-
rial, or a synthetic elastomeric product. (Elastomeric is a seamless paint or 
spray-on material that expands and contracts with the substrate. It’s particu-
larly popular for second-floor decks over living space where leak prevention 
is particularly important.) In any case, the biggest maintenance challenges 

22
Part I: Home Maintenance and You 
are keeping the surface clean, preventing leaks, and prolonging its life by 
patching, painting, staining, or sealing. Chapter 18 is chock-full of information 
that you can use to make your deck the envy of your neighborhood.
Fences
Fences, like decks, come in all shapes, sizes, and materials. Wood, steel 
cyclone, ornamental iron, vinyl, concrete block, plaster, and the new kid on 
the block, composite fencing, are the materials most widely used. In spite 
of the vast array of material choices, most fences are constructed of wood, 
including wood posts, wood frame, and wood fence boards (or pickets).
Regardless of the material used to construct it, keeping a fence plumb 
(upright); preventing posts, framing, and fence boards from deteriorating 
or being ravaged by pests; keeping fence boards securely attached to the 
framing; and taking the sag out of a gate are the items that can be found on 
most homeowners’ checklists. Chapter 18 tells you all about these tasks, and 
more. (If your fence is constructed of ornamental iron, go to Chapter 19 for 
care instructions; if it’s constructed of brick, check out the tips for caring for 
masonry in Chapters 4 and 17.)
Retaining walls
If your home is built on anything other than a flat lot, you already know that a 
retaining wall holds back earth that would otherwise come crashing through 
your home. It can also keep your home or yard from sliding down a hill. You 
can also use a retaining wall to expand the “usable” area of your property by 
terracing a slope.
Although more and more retaining walls are being constructed of interlock-
ing decorative block, the vast majority of residential, garden-variety retaining 
walls are constructed of wood posts and wood boards. The information in 
Chapter 6 about maintaining retaining walls can add years to the life of your 
retaining wall.
Ornamental iron
Ornamental iron is a fancy term for steel fencing, handrails, or other decora-
tive steel elements. It’s no surprise then that the biggest maintenance chal-
lenge associated with ornamental iron is rust — the reddish brittle coating 
that results from attack by moist air. Therefore, the key to preventing rust 

23
 Chapter 2: Getting to Know Your House and Its Systems
(and the damage it does) is to prohibit moist air and water from making con-
tact with the steel. Painting, as you see in Chapter 19, is the most effective 
means of stopping rust dead in its tracks.
Unfortunately, rust may have already sunk its ruthless teeth into your help-
less handrail. Before you pull out the old hacksaw to start cutting out bad 
spots, have a look at Chapter 19 for information on how to remove rust — 
chemically and mechanically — and what to do to patch the damage left in its 
tracks. You’ll discover not only our secrets to getting rust off, but also how to 
prevent it from returning.
The Interior: Your Home’s Insides
As with the exterior of your home, basic elements of the interior require 
maintenance from time to time. The following sections help you identify 
these elements and the ongoing maintenance they require.
The plumbing system
Of all of a home’s systems, the plumbing system is likely the most demanding 
when it comes to maintenance. Leaking pipes, clogged drains, and a banging 
water heater are just a few of the many plumbing-related maintenance chal-
lenges that pop up.
Let us be the first to tell you that Chapters 7, 8, and 9 are all wet. That’s 
because they focus on running water in the home. In these chapters, you can 
find out how to locate and shut off your water main, deal with your water 
heater, and care for wells and water softeners, as well as a bunch of other stuff.
Although the plumbing system is one of the most maintenance-intense, it 
really isn’t particularly complex. Even beginners can easily perform the most 
common plumbing maintenance tasks: cleaning, lubricating, adjusting, and 
replacing worn parts. Make your plumber jealous by reading all about these 
simple maintenance tasks in Chapters 7, 8, and 9.
Pipes and water heaters
Indoor plumbing is one of the marvels of the last hundred years. It can also 
be the scourge of mankind when it isn’t operating quite right. Banging or rat-
tling pipes, water pressure that has been reduced to a trickle, and shower 
temperatures that fluctuate like the stock market — one minute it’s nice and 
hot and the next you’re playing freeze-out. Yikes!

24
Part I: Home Maintenance and You 
Many factors can affect the performance of your water pipes: water pressure, 
scale buildup on the interior of the pipe, and a dreaded leak. Armed with the 
proper tools and the information in Chapter 8, all your water woes will soon 
be behind you. There, we tell you how to replace a clogged pipe, fix a leaking 
pipe, and increase water pressure. Who could ask for more?
When it comes to the water heater, what’s on most people’s minds is how long 
it’ll last before it conks out. What most people don’t understand is that, with 
a little care and maintenance, they can double or triple the life of their water 
heater — really! In Chapter 8, you learn that a little sediment removal from 
the bottom of the tank, replacement of a metal rod known as a sacrificial anode, 
and replacement of a broken dip tube (yes, there is such a thing) will keep 
your water heater going long after others have failed. And, as an added bonus, 
your utility bill will drop, and you’ll get a good night’s sleep if your water heater 
is rumbling in the middle of the night. We challenge you to find an undertaking 
that will have such a positive impact on so many facets of your life.
Fixtures
The best thing you can do for your sinks, faucets, toilets, tubs, and showers 
is to keep them clean. Chapter 8 offers straightforward guidance on this 
very topic.
The drain, waste, vent system
Chapter 9 discusses two essential elements of a plumbing system: running 
water and plumbing fixtures. Where does all the running water produced by 
faucets and all the waste produced by people and collected by fixtures go? 
Thankfully, it ends up in your on-site septic system or a municipal sewer 
system. The key is to get it from the fixture (tub, shower, sink, toilet, and so 
on) to one of these locations as quickly and as easily as possible.
The part of the plumbing system that performs this very important task is 
the drain, waste, and vent system. The drain and waste system uses grav-
ity to carry wastewater and solid material to your home’s main sewer line, 
located in the basement, in the crawlspace, or under the concrete slab.
The vent system prohibits dangerous sewer gases from making their way into 
your home. A “trap,” or water door, at each fixture accomplishes this chore 
by being full of water at all times. You’re probably familiar with the chrome or 
black plastic U-shaped pipe under your kitchen sink. What you may not know 
is that the same configuration exists below your bathtub and shower and is 
an integral part of the design of every toilet in your home.
If the foul odors don’t make it into your home, where do they go? They’re car-
ried out vent pipes that are connected to drainpipes and go through the roof. 
The vents also serve another important function. They equalize pressure in 

25
 Chapter 2: Getting to Know Your House and Its Systems
the drain and waste system that facilitates drainage and prevents the siphon-
ing of water from the traps.
What can go wrong? Plenty! Toilets, tubs, showers, and sinks can back up and 
cause chaos. What’s more, slow-running drains and the foul odor that accom-
pany them can drive you nuts. Don’t wait another moment. Set yourself and your 
drains free with the information in Chapters 7, 8, and 9 . Don’t waste another 
moment, because all your plumbing problems will soon be down the drain.
The heating, cooling, and 
ventilating systems
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) — without these systems 
our homes would be little more than the caves that primitive civilization once 
occupied. How important are these systems? You tell us. Try turning off your 
heating system in the dead of winter or your air-conditioning system when a 
heat wave sends the mercury soaring above 100 degrees. It’s no wonder that 
these systems are routinely referred to as “comfort systems” by heating and 
air-conditioning professionals. After all, their mission is to provide comfort, 
regardless of the climate or weather conditions.
There’s more to a home-comfort system than heating and air conditioning, 
of course. Studies show that most Americans spend more than 90 percent 
of their time indoors, so the quality of the indoor air has as much to do 
with health as it does comfort. That’s where ventilation comes in. Without 
adequate ventilation, heat, humidity, air pollutants, and odors can build up 
inside a home, causing serious health problems.
You can read about all these systems and find out how to maintain them in 
Chapter 10.
Heating
Home heating systems, also known as furnaces, come in various shapes, sizes, 
and configurations and are fueled by a host of different types of energy, includ-
ing natural gas, oil, propane, wood, coal, and even the sun. The common system 
styles include forced air, hydronic (water), steam, gravity, electric resistance, 
radiant, and solar. One thing that all the systems have in common, regardless of 
the style or the energy that powers them, is their need for periodic maintenance.
Cleaning, lubrication, burner adjustment, and filter replacement, which we 
tell you about in Chapter 10, are among the most common maintenance tasks 
needed to keep a furnace running at peak efficiency. The more efficient a system, 
the less it costs to operate, the less energy it uses, and the longer it lasts.

26
Part I: Home Maintenance and You 
Air conditioning
In 1902, Dr. Willis Carrier invented refrigerant air conditioning. Concerned 
that his new invention would receive a cool reception, he staged a boxing 
match to showcase this never-before-used technology. Although boxing 
remains a popular sport, it can’t begin to compare to the phenomenon that 
air conditioning has become. Today, a whopping 30 million homeowners cool 
their homes with central air conditioning. In addition, another 18 million 
homeowners cool one or more rooms in their homes with a room air condi-
tioner. That’s a lot of cooling!
All air conditioners, whether window- or wall-mounted units or whole-house 
central air-conditioning systems, operate on the same principle. A fan sucks 
warm indoor air across a series of cool coils that contain a refrigerant. The 
cooled air is then blown back into the room. Amazingly, the refrigerant 
absorbs the heat and then exhausts it outdoors through another system of 
coils and fans.
The maintenance requirements for a home cooling system don’t differ dra-
matically from those of its heating counterpart. In many cases, the systems 
are connected, sharing the same ductwork, blower, or other components. 
Cleaning, lubricating, and keeping the refrigerant level up are the most 
common maintenance tasks associated with a cooling system. (Many of these 
tasks should be performed by a professional, depending on what kind of 
system you have.) Maintain your cool by checking out Chapter 10.
Ventilation systems
There are two types of ventilation: passive and active. The former uses phys-
ics and natural air currents, while the latter incorporates some type of ener-
gized mechanical device. Passive systems can include a mechanical device 
so long as it isn’t energized. A roof-mounted wind turbine is an example of 
passive attic ventilation.
Mechanically powered exhaust fans in the attic, bathroom, kitchen, laundry, 
and basement are active means of improving ventilation, reducing indoor 
humidity, removing pollutants, and improving indoor air quality.
Here, again, cleaning and lubrication top the list when it comes to maintain-
ing a home’s ventilation systems. After you read Chapter 10, you can breathe 
easy knowing that you can keep your home’s ventilation system, and the 
people it serves, healthy.
Interior walls and ceilings
For the purposes of home maintenance, there isn’t much that you can do to 
maintain interior wall structure, per se. It’s the material that is on the interior 
walls that requires attention now and then. The same goes for the ceiling.

27
 Chapter 2: Getting to Know Your House and Its Systems
Drywall is the most common finish for walls and ceilings in homes built since 
the 1950s. Before that time, plaster was the material of choice for interior 
wallcovering.
Although drywall is a time- and cost-efficient building material, it doesn’t 
have the rigidity and resistance to damage that plaster does. By the same 
token, maintaining drywall is a heck of a lot easier than keeping plaster in 
shape. A nick here, a gouge there, a hole here, and a crack there — these are, 
without doubt, sights that are seen on the walls and ceiling of almost any 
home. They’re often the result of a doorknob crashing through the wall, a 
shift in the earth, foundation settlement, and the ever-present roughhousing 
by little ones.
Patching holes and cracks in walls and ceilings, cleaning grit and grime, and 
painting are by far the most pervasive maintenance tasks that folks encoun-
ter with their walls and ceilings. Cleaning, patching, and painting — it’s all in 
Chapter 11.
Floors and interior doors
Floors. You can’t live with them, and you can’t live without ’em! Maintenance-
starved floors can be summed up in three words: squeaky, creaky, and dirty. 
Sounds more like the members of a punk-rock group than a list of mainte-
nance woes.
As for interior doors, they’re particularly important elements in your home — 
particularly when they’re located at the entrance to a bedroom or bathroom — 
if you get our drift. Do they close easily and securely? Do they stay open with-
out the need for rocks or paperweights in their paths?
Floors
Floors get the most wear and tear of anything in a home. Cleaning is the 
single most effective means of cutting down on the deterioration of a floor. 
Frequent vacuuming and spot-cleaning can more than double a carpet’s life 
span. And if you’re looking for a way to keep the finish on your vinyl and 
hardwood flooring looking good, the answer is as close as a broom and dust-
pan. The grit and grime underfoot that we track into our homes acts like 
sandpaper that can turn a rich finish into a work in progress. The same holds 
true with ceramic tile and other types of flooring. Chapter 12 explains that 
when it comes to flooring, cleanliness is next to godliness.
Are squeaks in your floor driving you to the edge? You’re not alone. They are, 
without a doubt, one of the most common home-maintenance issues and, 
aside from leaks, a contractor’s biggest nightmare. Good news! Quieting a 
squeaking floor isn’t brain surgery. Better news: We tell you how to do it in 
Chapter 4.

Part I: Home Maintenance and You 
Doors
Open, close; open, close; slam shut! Interior doors get more than their share 
of use and the accompanying wear and tear. Beyond the occasional patch 
that needs to be made due to an errant clothes hanger or other hurling object 
that goes part in parcel with a disagreement between siblings (speaking from 
experience), door hinges can become loose, which can make a door really hard 
to open or close; the marriage between a latch and strike plate can become 
strained and prevent a door from being securely closed or locked; a pocket 
door can be jammed in its pocket; and it seems like sliding wardrobe doors are 
always coming off their tracks. So, if your home is experiencing some of these 
common door dilemmas, we suggest that you open the door to Chapter 12 for 
help on how to solve the problems once and for all. Door, er, case closed!
Cabinets and countertops
In the building trades, cabinets and countertops are referred to as finishes. 
We, on the other hand, like to refer to cabinets and countertops as your 
home’s furniture. Like your home’s furniture, aside from occasionally tight-
ening a screw here or there, the biggest maintenance challenge that faces 
each is cleaning. Grit and grime from cooking and sticky fingers are the most 
common cleaning tasks with these things. The cleaning means and methods 
vary from finish to finish, as you can read about in Chapter 13.
Aside from keeping your cabinets looking good, cabinet doors, like interior 
doors, have hinges and hardware that, from time to time, need lubricating and 
adjusting, as do the cabinet drawer glides and hardware. After you read Chapter 
13, your cabinets will, indeed, be like other fine furniture in your home.
In days gone by, countertops in most homes consisted simply of ceramic tile, 
plastic laminate, or linoleum with a metal edge. As with other home finishes, 
countertops have come a long way. Today, linoleum has all but disappeared, 
ceramic tile has remained strong, plastic laminate is enjoying renewed inter-
est, and an array of solid surface materials are the rage.
Scratches in plastic laminate; stained, cracked, or mildew-laden grout; and 
grungy caulk are among the most common complaints that folks have about 
their counters. Accordingly, Chapter 13 offers solutions to all these problems 
and then some.
Appliances
A well-maintained appliance is both energy efficient and safe. In Chapter 14, 
we tell you how to maintain your cooktop, oven, range hood, microwave, 
dishwasher, refrigerator, freezer, washing machine, and clothes dryer, so that 

29
 Chapter 2: Getting to Know Your House and Its Systems
you get maximum efficiency and safety from them. As a bonus, we include 
a host of our special “people-friendly” cleaning solutions that require less 
elbow grease and are safer for you, your family, and the environment.
Fireplaces: Traditional and gas
Today, a fireplace is rarely used as a primary source of home heating due to 
its poor efficiency. Nevertheless, fireplaces remain popular because they pro-
vide a cozy atmosphere and romantic appeal. More than any other element of 
a home, a fireplace represents warmth and comfort.
Not all fireplaces are created equal. Fireplaces built 50 to 100 years ago were 
constructed of solid stone or brick. After World War II, the fireplace became 
more of a decorative feature than a viable source of heat. Consequently, 
solid stone and brick were replaced by less pricey variations, such as the 
free-standing metal fireplace and “zero-clearance” prefabricated models. The 
latter have been used almost exclusively in new construction in the last 20 
years as a means of trimming building costs.
Cozy and romantic as it may be, a poorly maintained fireplace can be one 
of your home’s most deadly elements. If you have a fireplace, following the 
advice in Chapter 15 is imperative. Regardless of the age or style of construc-
tion of your fireplace, you have to follow certain maintenance routines to 
ensure that the fireplace is safe.
The firebox, glass doors, screen, damper, spark arrestor, flue, and chimney 
require ongoing maintenance. Although all aspects of a fireplace are impor-
tant, the integrity of the firebox and flue are of prime importance. Creosote, 
a byproduct of burning wood, can collect on the interior of a flue, and, 
when ignited, it can explode with the force of several sticks of dynamite. 
Consequently, one of the most important fireplace-related maintenance tasks 
is cleaning to prevent creosote buildup.
In addition to regular chimney inspection and cleaning, cleaning and adjust-
ing the glass doors and screen, cleaning and lubricating the damper, and 
making sure the spark arrestor is in tip-top shape are the most common pre-
ventive maintenance tasks.

your life!
Your home-safety systems
Repairing a leaking roof, quieting a squeaking floor, or making sure that your 
heating and cooling system is operating at peak performance are important 

30
Part I: Home Maintenance and You 
and beneficial tasks. However, in the grand scheme of all things home, noth-
ing is more important than making sure that your home is safe.
Home sweet home to most people consists of comfy surroundings and hand-
some finishes — cabinets, counters, flooring, and appliances. Yet the “bones” 
of a home consist of a complex system of pipes, wires, and ducts, which, 
often without warning, can go haywire and reduce your home to rubble.
A small electrical short can result in a disastrous house fire, and a poorly burn-
ing gas appliance not properly vented can produce deadly carbon monoxide.
 
If you don’t have smoke detectors and carbon-monoxide alarms, install them! 
If you do and they aren’t operating properly, fix them! A little maintenance 
can go a long way when it comes to smoke detectors and carbon-monoxide 
alarms. Vacuum them regularly, test them often, and replace the batteries at 
least twice a year or as needed.
The dangers associated with fire and carbon monoxide are clear. Less obvi-
ous is the devastating effect that a malfunctioning garage door or garage-
door opener can have on you or someone in your home. Small children and 
pets can be seriously injured or killed by a malfunctioning system. Is the 
auto-reverse (anti-crush) function working properly? Does your system have 
electronic sensor beams, and are they doing their job?
Another concern for keeping your home safe relates to personal safety and 
security from prowlers and unwanted visitors. Have you stopped setting your 
burglar alarm due to repeated false alarms? The false alarms may be something 
as simple as a loose contact at a window or door or a failing backup battery.
Throughout this book, you can find out about maintenance tasks that 
will keep your systems running efficiently and safely to prevent disaster. 
However, in Chapter 16, we focus on some of the more common safety issues 
and specific steps that you can take that can save your home, your life, and 
the lives of your family should disaster strike. When it comes to home main-
tenance, maintaining your home-safety systems is job number one!

W
hen people think about owning a home, they picture warm summer 
afternoons relaxing on the patio, not a hot afternoon fixing the fence 
around it. Fortunately, there are far more fun days than workdays. But don’t 
kid yourself: There will be work to do. Of course, we think it’s the fun kind of 
work. And we’re not alone. Many people get a great deal of enjoyment from 
maintaining and improving their homes.
Not a do-it-yourselfer? Not buying the work-as-fun concept? Let’s talk money, 
instead. Maintenance is the work required to protect and maintain what is 
probably your single largest investment — your home. It’s not optional. If it’s 
not done (by you or by a professional), your home and its systems will slowly 
deteriorate, operate less and less efficiently, look worse, and, ultimately, lose 
real value. So, with those negative outcomes in mind, we’re sure you’ll agree 
that maintenance is necessary.
This chapter helps you prioritize your home-maintenance tasks and provides 
home-maintenance schedules you can follow. And if you’re not a do-it-your-
selfer? Well, we tell you how to find a pro, too.
Your What-to-Tackle List
Out of the enormous universe of potential projects, which ones are the most 
important and when should you do them? Let’s talk about priorities. By setting 

32
Part I: Home Maintenance and You 
priorities, you make sure that your most critical and financially sensible 
projects get done first. This may seem to be the obvious approach, but you’d 
be surprised by how many low-priority jobs get done before truly necessary 
projects.
We understand how that happens. Do-it-yourselfers are eager to get going, so 
they begin with whatever comes to mind first. And homeowners frequently 
confuse what they want to do with what they need to do. Sure, installing a 
pretty new granite countertop is a lot more “fun” than shoring up a crumbling 
foundation wall, but it won’t be any fun when the kitchen starts sliding into 
the backyard.
We like to divide maintenance jobs into three categories:
 
✓ Musts are anything that threatens health and safety, violations of fire or 
building codes, structural weaknesses, and other critical needs.
 
✓ Shoulds are anything that cuts utility bills, reduces maintenance costs, 
or prevents a large repair in the future.
 
✓ Coulds are anything related to improving appearance and function.
For example, removing a dangerously obsolete (and probably overloaded), 
60-year-old fuse box and replacing it with a modern circuit-breaker box (and 
more amperage for today’s higher power demands) is, without question, a must. 
Reducing heating and cooling costs by adding another layer of attic insulation is 
a should. And wallpapering the bathroom is a could. Voilà! Intelligent priorities!
Musts: Safety and health
“Safety first” is more than a slogan. In all cases, safety and health issues 
are your number-one priorities. Don’t even think about doing anything else 
until you:
 
✓ Install smoke detectors and carbon-monoxide detectors everywhere 
they should be installed — in bedrooms, in hallways, and on every level 
of your home.
 
✓ Purchase and install appropriate fire extinguishers for the kitchen, 
garage, and workshop.
 
✓ Replace all old and faulty electrical wiring. If your home was built before 
1950, have the electrical system checked to make sure it isn’t danger-
ously overloaded by the much higher power needs of a modern family.
 
✓ Install a ground wire throughout the electrical system to prevent electri-
cal shock.

33
 Chapter 3: Putting Together Your Home Maintenance Plan
 
✓ Install ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) on all outlets within 4 
feet of a sink, on all exterior and garage outlets, and on all electrical fix-
tures over showers and bathtubs.
 
✓ Install or repair exterior lighting, for safety and security (aesthetics is 
just a bonus).
 
✓ Clean out the dryer duct and replace the lint-catching flexible duct with 
a smooth, rigid duct.
 
✓ Replace old, unsafe appliances.
 
✓ Have the furnace professionally serviced and repaired (or replaced) as 
necessary.
 
✓ Test for lead and asbestos, and perform any necessary abatement.
 
✓ Repair unsecure or wobbly handrails.
 
✓ Install a child-safe, auto-reversing garage door opener.
 
✓ Replace any untempered-glass sliding-glass doors and shower doors.
 
✓ Apply non-slip decals to the bottom of every bathtub.
 
✓ Eliminate mold and take steps to prevent regrowth.
 
✓ Replace or reinforce failing foundation components and broken or sag-
ging structural members.
 
✓ Make any improvements — installing grab bars and ramps, widening 
doors, changing door levers, and so on — that are necessary to improve 
the safety of elderly or physically challenged people in your home.
It just makes sense to do these things before any others. After all, they’re the 
tasks and projects that prevent fire, injury, and failure. Can you make a good 
argument for wallpapering the bathroom before completing every single one 
of these tasks? We didn’t think so!
Shoulds: Reducing costs and 
preventing problems
Jobs that save energy and reduce utility costs come next. If you’re looking 
to save big money and make your home significantly more efficient and eco-
friendly, you should do the following tasks:
 
✓ Add attic insulation.
 
✓ Insulate heating and cooling ducts.

34
Part I: Home Maintenance and You 
 
✓ Seal gaps around doors, windows, and pipes.
 
✓ Caulk around window and door frames.
 
✓ Install weatherstripping on exterior doors and windows.
 
✓ Insulate the water heater and hot-water pipes.
 
✓ Replace old toilets with modern, water-saving toilets.
 
✓ Schedule yearly furnace/boiler and air-conditioning service.
 
✓ Replace an old “gas-guzzling” furnace or power-gobbling air conditioner.
 
✓ Enhance attic and crawlspace ventilation.
 
✓ Replace old appliances with today’s highly efficient Energy Star–rated 
appliances.
 
✓ Take steps to protect against termites and other structural pests.
 
✓ Replace energy-inefficient single-pane windows with new double- or 
triple-pane windows.
 
✓ Repair dripping faucets and constantly running toilets.
Doing things that prevent future problems is literally putting money in the 
bank. It’s smart to fix a small problem before it can become a bigger, more 
expensive repair. If you want to do all you can to avoid trouble tomorrow, do 
these things:
 
✓ Seal any exterior gaps, including in siding and trim and around windows, 
doors, and pipes.
 
✓ Maintain and repair the roof and flashings.
 
✓ Monitor the condition of bathtub caulk and grout, and replace as 
necessary.
 
✓ Find and stop foundation, crawlspace, or basement seepage.
 
✓ Regularly clean and repair gutters, extend downspouts away from the 
foundation, and regrade the soil so water is directed away from the 
home.
 
✓ Repair driveway, walkway, and patio deterioration, and seal cracks.
 
✓ Paint exterior siding, trim, decks, and fences as needed.
 
✓ Repair exterior cracks as soon as possible.
 
✓ Trim bushes and trees away from the house.
 
✓ Tuck-point brick and block as necessary.
 
✓ Repair or replace leaking shower or tub walls.

 Chapter 3: Putting Together Your Home Maintenance Plan
Did you notice something about these projects? Most of them are about pre-
venting water damage. The fact is, water and moisture are the number-one ene-
mies of your home. Doing the jobs in this list, even if you do nothing else, will 
go a long way toward protecting your home’s systems, structure, and value.
Coulds: Improving appearance 
and function
Many of the projects in this category are simple, inexpensive fixes or cleaning 
tasks that require what our grandfather called “elbow grease” — jobs like:
 
✓ Patching holes in wallboard
 
✓ Tightening up door hinges
 
✓ Shining up a kitchen sink
 
✓ Cleaning cabinets
 
✓ Getting rid of mildew
Others are cosmetic improvements such as:
 
✓ Painting the exterior
 
✓ Installing crown molding
 
✓ Putting in a new entry door
 
✓ Installing new carpet
 
✓ Adding a skylight
 
✓ Replacing cabinet and drawer pulls
 
✓ Installing new door hardware
And still others are practical, functional improvements such as:
 
✓ Replacing an old, tired cooktop or dishwasher
 
✓ Replacing shower tile
 
✓ Replacing a worn-out garage door
 
✓ Adding cabinet accessories like a pull-out rack
 
✓ Installing basement storage shelves
 
✓ Installing wardrobe organizational systems

Making your maintenance plan
After you know how to prioritize your tasks, it’s time to make your mainte-
nance plan:
 
1. Grab a notepad and pen, and go through your home top to bottom 
and end to end, writing down everything you see that needs to be 
done, using the lists in this chapter to help you.
 
 Be realistic. A 300-item list isn’t going to get done. Focus on what you 
can do in the next six months. Promise yourself you’ll make another plan 
at the end of the six months, and then do it.
 
2. Mark each item with an M (for must), an S (for should), a C (for 
could), or an L (for later); then prioritize within those main categories 
by putting a number by the letter: M1, M2, M3, and so on.
 
 Take a few minutes to make yourself a clean, easy-to-follow plan with 
every task or project listed in priority order. Put the later tasks on a 
separate sheet, and save them for the next plan.
 
Compiling your list on a computer using Microsoft Word (or a similar word-
processing program) or in Microsoft Excel (or a similar spreadsheet program) 
will make it easier and faster to sort items and change priorities.
Done. Now get to work — and try to have fun!
Your Home-Maintenance Schedule
Maintenance performed regularly and on schedule provides optimum longev-
ity and helps prevent potential breakdowns or malfunctions. Beyond main-
tenance procedures for operational sake, the primary (and most important) 
reason for checking, inspecting, and constantly tuning up your home is to 
ensure maximum safety for you, your family, and your friends.
Every home is different, so feel free to pick and choose from the following 
checklists. Whether you live in a typical suburban house, a condominium, a 
town house, a high-rise apartment, a farmhouse, or a palatial country estate, 
you’re sure to find many items that pertain to your home.
 
Save manufacturers’ instructions and product manuals for maintenance 
instructions and cleaning tips. If you don’t have them, you can probably find 
them online at the manufacturers’ Web sites.

Here are additional maintenance tasks that need to be done periodically:
 
✓ If your refrigerator is more than 10 years old, defrost and clean it every 
two months (Chapter 14).
 
✓ If you use your stovetop range often:
 
• Inspect electrical plug-in tips for grease or corrosion weekly

twice a year (Chapter 16).
 
✓ Test the backup battery on your burglar alarm at least twice a year 
(Chapter 16).
Paying Attention to Safety
Working around the house can be especially satisfying. It can also be 
extremely dangerous. Having the right safety gear (and using it), and practic-
ing good work habits can prevent an otherwise pleasurable experience from 
becoming a nightmare.
 
The Boy Scout motto is “Be prepared.” It should also be your motto when it 
comes to tackling home projects:
 
✓ Know where the power, water, and gas shut-offs are, and how to use 
them. Try them all at least once so you know if they’re difficult to turn or 
hard to reach. You don’t want to be figuring it out during an emergency!
 
✓ Know where a fire extinguisher is. Even better, keep a small one in 
your tool bucket. Fire is a possibility whenever you’re working with 
torches, heat guns, electricity, or power tools, or when you’re doing 
demolition. You never know what’ll happen, and you want to be ready if 
you have a close encounter of the flaming kind.
Your clothing and safety gear
No one expects to look like a fashion plate when doing chores, but there’s 
more to what you wear when you’re tackling home maintenance than being 
comfortable. Make sure you do the following:
 
✓ Always wear safety glasses! And they go on your eyes, not on your head 
or in your pocket!
 
✓ Wear gloves when you can. Handling small screws and little parts is 
difficult with gloves on, but you can protect your hands most of the

time — especially when using power tools or working with anything that 
can cut, puncture, scratch, burn, or squash your hands.
 
✓ Always wear protective footwear. Work boots are best. Absolutely no 
flip-flops or sandals. A dropped tool or falling two-by-four will truly and 
terribly hurt your tootsies.
 
✓ Tie back your hair. You really don’t want it to get caught up in a drill or 
saw. Be safe and put it up in a ponytail.
 
✓ Wear a shirt with short sleeves or sleeves that can be rolled up or but-
toned snugly at the wrist. Flowing sleeves are a lovely look for a garden 
party, and an oversized sweatshirt may be comfy, but they may get 
tangled in power tools, catch on corners, snag tools, and even catch fire.
Your work habits
If you don’t work smart, the chances that you’ll either hurt yourself or 
damage your home are significantly increased. Do the following to stay safe 
while you work:
 
✓ Never work alone on dangerous projects, on ladders, or on the roof. 
It’s always good to have someone to help maneuver big materials, 
steady the ladder, or call an ambulance.
 
✓ Use the right tool for the job. Using a tool for something other than its 
intended use is asking for trouble. No wrench/hammers or screwdriver/
drills! Remember that keeping your tools sharp and clean will produce 
superior-quality results. Plus, sharp and clean tools are safer to use.
 
✓ Protect your work area. A dropped hammer will mess up the floor. A 
spilled gallon of paint will take hours to clean up. Why risk damaging 
your home or its contents? Remove everything that doesn’t need to be 
in your work area; cover whatever remains and every inch of the floor 
with dropcloths. A good-quality reusable canvas dropcloth will pay for 
itself many times over in preventing damage.
 
✓ Work neatly and eliminate tripping hazards. Keep your work area — 
especially the floor — free of tools, extension cords, and supplies. Put 
tools you aren’t using in your bucket or out of the way. Bring in only the 
materials you need at the moment. Remove anything you no longer need 
for the job.
 
✓ Follow basic ladder-safety rules. Don’t overreach. Position your ladder 
properly and on a stable surface. Never use a bucket or chair instead of 
a stepladder.
 
✓ Keep a phone nearby while you’re working. If you break your leg fall-
ing off the ladder, you’ll have to crawl only a few feet to summon help! 
Better yet, keep your cellphone in your pocket.

Do It Yourself or Hire a Pro? 
The $64,000 Question
Some jobs are either too big or too hard to do yourself, and there’s no shame 
in hiring a pro to do them. But how do you know when you need to outsource 
a maintenance project? Simple! When you’ll be in over your head. When you’re 
crunched for time. When you don’t have the specialized tools needed. When 
you won’t be happy with your results. When you don’t have the energy. When 
you don’t want to be bothered. When the task requires specialized expertise.
Bottom line: If the job is going to be a pain in the butt and will exceed your 
skill/experience level, you’re better off hiring someone who will do it right in 
a reasonable amount of time.
 
With that in mind, we think the jobs best left to experienced, expert pros include
 
✓ Furnace, boiler, and air-conditioner service and repair
 
✓ Major electrical or plumbing work
 
✓ Lead and asbestos testing and abatement
 
✓ Chimney cleaning and repair
 
✓ Foundation repairs and waterproofing and structural repairs
 
✓ Window or roof replacement
 
✓ Tuck-pointing
 
✓ Carpet and sheet-vinyl installation
 
✓ Garage-door installation
Everything else, pretty much, is up to you.
Finding a pro
The best way to find a qualified, reliable professional is to get referrals from 
your relatives, friends, and neighbors. Period. End of discussion. Every other 
way is a complete crapshoot. So ask! If someone you know has had a good 
experience (not just an okay one) with a particular professional, add that 
person or company to your referral list.
Also keep an eye peeled for trucks in front of homes in your neighborhood. 
Visit or call your neighbors and ask about their experiences with the contrac-
tors who’ve been working in their homes. Also, ask if they can recommend 

46
Part I: Home Maintenance and You 
other types of professionals. Add the ones who receive good reviews to your 
referral list.
When you don’t have a referral for a particular type of pro, improve the 
likelihood of a successful outcome by calling an established local company. 
Companies with roots in the community and a history of serving people in 
the community are unlikely to be unqualified hacks — they couldn’t stay in 
business if they were. Plus, they’ll be more familiar with homes like yours.
 
Check for licensing (where required), permits, and insurance. If you aren’t sure 
what the licensing requirement is in your neck of the woods, check with your 
municipal and county offices. These folks can also tell you what type of insur-
ance contractors are required to have and which permits you’ll need.
 
When checking insurance coverage, always require certification directly from 
the insurance carrier, not the contractor.
For most maintenance jobs, that’s the majority of the information-gathering 
you need to do. You’re ready to move on to getting a price quote.
Getting a quote
If the job in question is really simple — such as a minor furnace service — 
the price is usually based on an hourly rate with a minimum service call or 
trip fee. The job isn’t very complicated, and the price is based on a few hours 
of work. Often, such tasks are so inexpensive that it isn’t worth getting lots of 
quotes — especially if you know that the company has a good reputation.
Comparing estimates for service work is a bit easier than dealing with large, 
complicated projects like extensive rot repair or a roof replacement. So, 
for most of these bigger maintenance jobs, you’ll want to get extensive and 
detailed quotes.
After you’ve determined the scope of the job, ask your approved pros to esti-
mate what the job would cost and how long it would take. Try to get two or 
three quotes, and make sure you’re comparing apples to apples, that all the 
quotes encompass the same scope of work, and that all the quotes use essen-
tially the same quality of materials.
Selecting a pro
With quotes in hand (which inevitably vary widely in price), you’re ready to 
assess the professionalism, skill, and experience of the pros in question and 
evaluate their estimates.

47
 Chapter 3: Putting Together Your Home Maintenance Plan
Even small maintenance projects require the same kind of investigation and 
reference-checking as major remodeling projects. With your home and money 
at stake, you want to make absolutely sure that you’ve hired a reputable, pro-
fessional, and qualified contractor.
 
Never make price the most important criteria — don’t automatically choose 
the lowest bidder. Instead, all else being equal, you’re usually better off select-
ing the contractor whose price is nearest the average of the bids.
 
Choose an individual or firm that you feel comfortable with. Home-
maintenance projects involve a certain degree of closeness.
 
One final piece of advice: Never, ever, ever hire someone who comes uninvited 
to your door offering a “special deal” on driveway coating, roofing, carpet 
cleaning, and so on. These unsolicited visits almost always are scams, and the 
only thing they’re going to do is take your money.

Foundation and Floor 
Frame Fundamentals
In This Chapter
▶ Stopping cracks in the foundation
▶ Caring for brick and block foundations
▶ Keeping your basement dry
▶ Silencing creaky floors forever
▶ Leveling uneven floors
“A
 home is only as good as its foundation.” We couldn’t agree more 
with this familiar phrase! A sound foundation keeps other parts 
of a home in good working order. In this chapter, we tell you how to care for 
this important component of your home. We show you how to keep cracks in 
concrete from spreading, maintain mortar surrounding brick, control excess 
water, and keep your basement or crawlspace dry.
The foundation bone supports the floor frame bone, and the floor frame bone 
supports the subfloor bone. Together the foundation and floor surround 
the crawlspace or basement. In this chapter, we tell you how to rid the floor 
system of squeaks, sagging, and unevenness and how to care for the under-
side to prevent fungus and rot.
Focusing on the Foundation
The foundation is a home’s infrastructure. It supports the floor, wall, and roof 
structure. It helps keep floors level, basements dry, and, believe it or not, 
windows and doors operating smoothly. The foundation is also an anchor 
of sorts: It often travels deep into the ground, creating a structural bond 
between the house and the earth, which can be especially important if your 
home is built on anything other than flat ground or is in an area prone to 
earthquakes.

52
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
Interestingly, the origin of many leaks and squeaks can be traced to the foun-
dation. A cracked or poorly waterproofed foundation, for example, can result 
in excess moisture in a crawlspace or basement. Without adequate ventila-
tion, this moisture can condense and lead to, at best, musty odors, leaks, and 
squeaks, and, at worst, rotted floor framing.
There are different types of foundations and different foundation materials. 
The foundation of your house may be a slab, a basement, or a crawlspace, 
and it may be made of poured-in-place concrete, brick, concrete block, or 
stone. With each of these configurations come a host of specific maintenance 
routines that can safeguard your home’s integrity.
Types of foundations: Slabs, basements, 
and crawlspaces
The area below the main floor and within the foundation walls can consist of 
a concrete slab, a crawlspace, or a basement.
Almost all houses have one of the following foundations; some have a 
combination — slab in one area, for example, and a basement in another. 
But only a very few homes in the developed world still lie directly upon the 
ground without the aid of a proper foundation.
 
✓ Slabs: Slab is short for concrete slab. A slab floor (see Figure 4-1) is one 
made of concrete poured directly onto the ground (poured in place). 
Slab floors are very rigid, so they don’t give the way a wood floor does, 
making them prone to cracking. Unlike wood, concrete floors never 
squeak and don’t rot.

 Chapter 4: Foundation and Floor Frame Fundamentals
 
✓ Basements: Today, basement walls are commonly constructed of con-
crete block or solid concrete (which is poured in place). In the past, 
basement walls were sometimes constructed of brick as well. We prefer 
solid concrete, but, with proper engineering, concrete block is every bit 
as strong as solid concrete.
 
✓ Crawlspaces: If you don’t have a slab foundation, you have a wood-
framed floor. And if you don’t have a basement, the void between the 
ground and the underside of a wood-framed floor is known as the crawl-
space. The clearance helps to prevent rot and termite attack that can 
occur when wood and dirt come into contact with each other.
 
 Why the name crawlspace? Because you can stand up in a basement but 
not in a crawlspace. In a crawlspace, you have to crawl. We never admit-
ted to being rocket scientists.
Foundation materials
The most common foundation materials are solid concrete, brick, concrete 
block, and stone. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, as the fol-
lowing list explains:
 
✓ Solid concrete (see Figure 4-2): Solid concrete foundations are made 
of a mixture of cement, sand, rock or gravel, and water. When poured 
into forms and left to dry, this pancake-batter-like blend becomes unbe-
lievably rigid. Steel reinforcing bars are used within the concrete to 
create added strength. Because of its rigidity, concrete can crack when 
the earth moves, which can lead to foundation shifting and cracks that 
can undermine the home’s structural integrity. Water leaks also can 
result.

Part II: The Energy Envelope 
 
✓ Concrete block (see Figure 4-3): Concrete-block foundations are very 
popular because they can be built by anyone who can lay one block atop 
another (making the concrete block the DIYer’s foundation material of 
choice). Unlike brick, large holes within the blocks allow for steel rein-
forcing and mortar — both of which add super strength to the finished 
wall. Each block is joined with mortar on all four sides. Mortar has a 
tendency to deteriorate or crack (or both) over time and needs to be 
regularly maintained. Cracks in mortar can allow leaks.
 
✓ Brick: Brick foundations aren’t common today. Their strength is inferior 
to that of other foundation materials, because they normally don’t con-
tain steel reinforcing. Old brick foundations still exist, but they’re being 
replaced or retrofitted with concrete as they begin to fail.
 
 If your foundation is built of brick (more likely if your house was 
built before the 1930s), be sure to read the sections of this chapter 
on dealing with efflorescence (lime buildup resulting from water 
evaporation), moisture control, grading and drainage, and especially 
tuck-pointing. If your brick foundation is not reinforced with steel (and 
it probably isn’t) or it’s crumbling, consult a structural engineer right 
away to determine what can be done to improve the integrity of the 
foundation.
 
 Note: An unreinforced brick foundation in good condition can be rein-
forced by capping the foundation with concrete reinforced with steel.
 
✓ Stone: If a foundation is composed of massive chunks of granite, the 
foundation is probably incredibly strong — the Egyptians proved that. 
Other than granite, though, just about every other kind of stone founda-
tion can be compared to brick. And, like brick, stone foundations usually 
lack a key element — reinforcing steel.

 Chapter 4: Foundation and Floor Frame Fundamentals
Fixing Common Foundation Problems
A variety of maladies can occur on all the different types of foundations: efflores-
cence, cracks, seepage, spalling (chipping) and disintegration (caused by water 
getting into the foundation and freezing and thawing), and settling. Fortunately, 
we tell you how to deal with all these problems in the following sections.
Is there a fungus among us? 
Dealing with efflorescence
One of the most common foundation ailments is a white powdery substance 
that appears on the ground under your home, on the floor framing, or on 
your foundation or basement walls. Although most people mistake the white 
powder for a fungus (fungus is typically green or black), it’s really efflores-
cence, a growth of salt crystals caused by evaporation of salt-laden water.
Efflorescence appears when mineral salts in the concrete or mortar leak 
to the surface. Although efflorescence is not particularly destructive, it is 
unsightly and can, in some cases, result in splintering or minor deterioration 
of the surface it grows on.
To remove efflorescence, follow these steps:
 
1. Using a wire brush, remove as much of the efflorescence as you can.
 
2. Using a nylon brush, apply a vinegar solution (1 cup vinegar in 1 
quart water) or, for really tough jobs, use a muriatic acid solution (1 
cup of muriatic acid in 9 cups of water).
 
 Muriatic acid is swimming pool acid. You can find it in swimming pool 
supply stores as well as many hardware stores and home centers.
 
 Working with acid can be dangerous. Always wear safety goggles, rubber 
gloves, and protective clothing, and always have plenty of ventilation. 
Add the acid to the water in a plastic bucket. Adding the water to the 
acid can produce a dangerous reaction.
 
3. Allow the solution to stand for 10 to 15 minutes, but don’t let it dry.
 
4. Thoroughly rinse the area with fresh water.
 
 More than one application may be required to achieve the desired result.
Unless the soil in your area is particularly alkaline, efflorescence will usually 
cease to exist after the concrete or mortar is a couple of years old. If the efflo-
rescence continues to rear its ugly head, check out the nearby sidebar.

56
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
Being wise about cracks
Foundations are rigid and tend to crack over time. Minor cracks, though 
unsightly, are not normally cause for alarm. Major cracks, on the other hand, 
indicate substantial movement and can undermine the home’s structural 
integrity. Therefore, you can’t just ignore cracks in a foundation or concrete 
slab. Filling in these cracks and stopping them from spreading is essential to 
preventing serious structural issues in your foundation.
 
If your foundation or structural slab has an excessive number of smaller 
cracks or cracks that are larger than 1/4 inch in width, have it examined by a 
structural or civil engineer to assess the extent of the damage and to deter-
mine the source. If the damage is severe, consult a geotechnical or soils engi-
neer, who can suggest solutions to correct the problem once and for all.
Sealing cracks in concrete foundations and slabs
Even in the best of conditions, concrete moves a fraction of an inch here or 
there, not always resulting in a crack. And, believe it or not, concrete expands 
on hot days and shrinks when the weather is cold!
Therefore, when patching cracks in concrete, use a product that gives a little. 
The more elastic the product, the less likely a crack will reappear. One of our 
favorite patching products for cracks that are wider than 1/8 inch is a vinyl 
concrete patch, which usually comes packaged dry in a box.
Getting rid of the repeat offender: 
Efflorescence that won’t go away
If the efflorescence continues to appear, you 
can usually solve the problem by sealing the 
concrete, masonry, or stone with a penetrat-
ing concrete sealer. Use a high-quality silicone 
concrete and masonry sealer. These sealers 
are generally clear and last for six months to a 
year depending upon the climate.
We don’t recommend using inexpensive “water 
seals” because they don’t offer the high level of 
protection that better-quality, pricier products 
do. Keep in mind that you need to apply the 
cheaper stuff more frequently, which generally 
ends up costing more money in the long run.
You can apply concrete sealers with a brush, 
roller, or a pump garden sprayer. Make sure 
that the concrete is clean before you seal it, 
though. A good power washing with a pressure 
washer or water blaster prior to application of 
the sealer offers the greatest penetration and 
lasting quality.

57
 Chapter 4: Foundation and Floor Frame Fundamentals
To repair a small crack, follow these steps:
 
1. Clean the area and get rid of any loose chips.
 
 For cracks wider than 1/8 inch, use a small sledgehammer and a cold 
chisel to chip away loose material, as shown in Figure 4-4.
 
Figure 4-4: 
Chipping 
away loose 
material in 
a crack.
 
 
2. Mix the concrete patch to the consistency of a thin paste.
 
 We like to mix the dry patch powder with latex instead of water to give 
the product some added elasticity and adhesion. You can find latex 
additives, like patching compounds, at most hardware stores or home 
centers. Also, mix only a small amount of paste at a time because most 
products tend to dry pretty quickly.
 
3. Mist the crack with water and then trowel the patching paste into the 
crack with a trowel.
 
 Wetting the crack with water before installing a patching product prevents 
the moisture in the patch material from being drawn out by dry concrete, 
which causes the patch material to crack and not form a solid bond.
 
 If the existing concrete surrounding the patch is rough, you can match 
the finish by sweeping it with a broom.
 
4. Use a trowel to scrape away any excess paste to create a smooth and 
uniform finish.
 
5. Clean up your tools and buckets immediately to avoid the patching 
compound drying in and on them.

58
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
 
If you can’t find vinyl concrete patch material, mix one part Portland cement 
to three parts sand; then add enough concrete bonding agent to make a stiff 
mixture about the consistency of mashed potatoes. Take a small part of the 
mixture and add more bonding agent so that it becomes a soupy consistency. 
Brush the soupy mixture into the crack using an old paintbrush, and then pack 
the stiff mixture into the crack with a metal trowel. Use the trowel to create a 
smooth finish.
 
To repair large gaps (1/4 inch or greater) in concrete (such as those between a 
concrete slab and foundation wall) that are not structural in nature and don’t 
require advice from an engineer, use a latex caulk that contains silicone or a 
polyurethane caulk. You pump these products into the joint with a caulking 
gun; the caulking products remain pliable to allow for ongoing expansion and 
contraction. (Because most of these caulking products are self-leveling, no 
troweling is required.) Be sure to lightly spray the patch with water twice a 
day for a week to help it cure and prevent cracking.
Tuck-pointing brick and block foundations
Before the 1930s, bricks were used extensively to construct foundations. 
Today, however, if a foundation doesn’t consist of solid concrete, it’s prob-
ably constructed of concrete block. In either case, brick and block have one 
thing in common: They’re both joined together using mortar, a combination 
of sand and cement.
Unfortunately, over time, mortar tends to deteriorate. Not only are cracked and 
deteriorating mortar joints unsightly, but they also diminish the integrity of the 
surface and can allow water to get behind the brick or block and cause major 
damage. You can avoid these problems by tuck-pointing the brick or block 
foundation, which means removing and replacing cracked or missing mortar.
If the area is manageable, any do-it-yourselfer can easily perform the task by 
following these steps (shown in Figure 4-5). Note: If the cracked or deteriorat-
ing mortar is extensive — an entire foundation, wall, or wainscot — leave the 
tuck-pointing to professionals.
 
1. Chip away cracked and loose mortar using a slim, cold chisel and a 
hammer; remove the existing material to a depth of approximately 
1/2 inch.
 
 Be sure to wear safety goggles to avoid catching a piece of flying mortar 
in the eye. Use the cold chisel slowly and carefully, to avoid damaging 
the surrounding brick. Clean up all the loose material and dust using a 
brush after you finish chiseling.
 
2. Prepare your mortar and allow the mix to set for about five minutes.
 
 You can buy mortar premixed, or you can create your own batch using 
one part masonry cement and three parts fine sand. In either case, add 

59
 Chapter 4: Foundation and Floor Frame Fundamentals
enough water to create a paste — about the consistency of oatmeal. 
It’s best to keep the mix a touch on the dry side. If it’s too runny, it’ll be 
weak and will run down the wall, making it difficult to apply.
 
3. Brush the joints with fresh water.
 
 Doing so removes any remaining dust and prevents the existing mortar 
from drawing all the moisture out of the new mortar. Otherwise, the 
mortar can be difficult to apply and will most likely crack.
 
4. Apply the mortar using a pie-shaped trowel called a pointing trowel.
 
 Force the mortar into the vertical joints first, and remove the excess (to 
align with the existing adjacent mortar) using a brick jointer. The brick 
jointer helps create a smooth and uniform finish. After all the vertical 
joints are filled in, tackle the horizontal ones.
 
 Avoid applying mortar in extreme weather conditions because the 
mortar won’t properly set up.
 
5. A week or two later, after the mortar has had the opportunity to set 
up, apply a coat of high-quality acrylic or silicone masonry sealer to 
the entire surface (brick, block, and mortar).
 
 The sealer prevents water damage, which is especially important if you 
live in an area that gets particularly cold. Unsealed brick, block, and 
mortar absorb water that freezes in cold weather. The water turns to ice 
and causes the material to expand and crack. Periodic sealing prevents 
this situation from occurring.

Preventing moisture under your home
If you see efflorescence (see the earlier section “Is there a fungus among us? 
Dealing with efflorescence”) on your basement walls and/or crawlspace 
and your crawlspace is perpetually damp and mildewy, you have a moisture 
problem.
What’s a little water under the house going to hurt, you ask? Lots! Aside from 
turning a trip into the crawlspace into a mud-wrestling match or your basement 
into a sauna, excess moisture can lead to a glut of problems such as repulsive 
odors, rotted framing, structural pests, foundation movement, efflorescence, 
and allergy-irritating mold. We can’t stress enough the importance of doing 
everything you can to keep excess moisture out from this area of your home.
Rooting out the cause of the moisture
A musty or pungent odor usually accompanies efflorescence and excessive 
moisture. Accordingly, a good sniffer proves invaluable in investigating the 
problem. Here are common causes of moisture:
 
✓ Leaks in water and sewer lines under the home: A failing plumbing fit-
ting or corroded pipe is often the culprit. Fitting a replacement or install-
ing a repair sleeve around the damaged section of pipe almost always 
does the trick. (See Chapter 8 for information on how to perform these 
maintenance tasks.)
 
✓ A leaking toilet, tub, or valve located in the walls above: Although a 
leaking toilet is often visible from above, most leaks must be searched 
out from below the floor. When it comes to finding the cause of a damp 
basement or crawlspace, leave no stone unturned.
 
✓ Overwatering planters surrounding the house: Adjusting watering 
time, watering less often, installing an automatic timer, and adjusting 
sprinkler heads are the simplest means of solving this problem. Better 
yet, for planters next to the house, convert the traditional sprinkler 
system to a drip irrigation system. Doing so not only helps dry things 
out under the house, but also makes for a healthier garden and con-
serves water as well.
 
✓ Poor or nonexistent floor insulation: Poor floor insulation can be 
another contributing factor to heightened condensation or dampness in 
a crawlspace or basement. (See Chapter 6 for more information on insu-
lation and the importance it plays.)
Diverting water from the foundation
Keeping water out of the crawlspace or basement is critically important. You 
can acquire the necessary protection in several ways.

61
 Chapter 4: Foundation and Floor Frame Fundamentals
Making the grade
Be sure that the soil around your home slopes away from the foundation. The 
slope helps to divert most irrigation and rainwater away from the structure.
The earth within 30 inches of the foundation should slope down and away at 
a rate of 1/10 of an inch per foot. We think that 1/4 inch per foot is better.
 
If you’re having a difficult time determining the slope, use a measuring tape 
and a level. Rest one end of the level on the soil against the foundation and 
point the opposite end away in the direction that the ground should slope. With 
the bubble centered between the level lines, use the measuring tape to measure 
the distance between the bottom of the level and the top of the soil. For exam-
ple, if you’re using a 3-foot level and you’re establishing a grade of 1/4 inch per 
foot, the distance between the level and the soil should be at least 3/4 inch.
To grade the soil around your home, you need a pick, a shovel, a steel rake, 
and a strong back. You also need a homemade tamp that consists of a block 
of wood attached to a wood post that serves as a handle. Use the pick to 
loosen the soil and to break large clumps into smaller, more manageable soil 
that you can grade with the steel rake. Rocks and large clumps should be 
removed and replaced with clean fill dirt that can be well tamped. After you 
complete your grading work, use a garden hose to wet down the area to fur-
ther compact the soil. Wetting down the area also gives you an opportunity 
to test how the soil drains.
 
Build up your grading with well-tamped dirt and not loose topsoil, which 
easily erodes.
Paths and patios should slope away from the foundation, too. A patio or 
path that slopes toward the home discharges water into the basement or 
crawlspace, a condition that breeds foundation problems and structural rot. 
Unfortunately, the only sure way to correct this problem is to remove and 
replace the patio or path, and that can get really pricey.
Using gutters
Contrary to what you may think, rain gutters are more than a decorative ele-
ment for the roofline of a home. Their primary purpose is to capture the tremen-
dous amount of rainfall that runs off the average roof. Without gutters, rainwa-
ter collects at the foundation and, consequently, ends up in the crawlspace or 
basement. So, if you don’t have gutters, install them. And if you do have gutters, 
keep them clean. (See Chapter 5 for more information on cleaning gutters.)
Make sure that your gutters and downspouts direct water a safe distance 
away from the house. Even worse than not having gutters and downspouts 
is having downspouts that jettison water directly onto the foundation. We 

62
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
recommend piping the water 20 feet away from the foundation. You can use 
a length of rigid or flexible plastic drainpipe (without perforations) to carry 
water away from the downspout outlet to a safe location. Better yet, to avoid 
an eyesore and a potential trip hazard, bury the drainpipes below the ground.
Giving the problem some air: Automatic foundation vents
Ventilation is another effective means of controlling moisture in a crawlspace 
or basement. You can use either passive or active ventilation:
 
✓ Passive ventilation doesn’t use mechanical equipment. Foundation 
vents (metal screens or louvers) and operable daylight windows for 
basements are the best sources of passive ventilation.
 
✓ Active ventilation involves mechanical equipment, such as an exhaust fan.
Passive ventilation should always be your first choice because it allows 
nature to be your workhorse and doesn’t necessitate the use of energy to 
drive the mechanical device. You save on your utility bill and help the envi-
ronment by not relying on fossil fuels.
 
If you use passive ventilation, you must keep the vents clean to allow maxi-
mum airflow. You may need to thin nearby shrubbery, vines, and ground 
cover from time to time. If vents are clear and moisture is still a problem, you 
may be able to add additional vents. Because adding vents can affect the aes-
thetic and structural elements of the home, consult a qualified engineer for 
this project.
All the passive ventilation in the world may not be enough to dry out some 
problem basements. In this case, install an active source of ventilation, such as 
an exhaust fan. Installing an exhaust fan requires some minor carpentry and an 
electrical source. (See Chapter 10 for more information on ventilation.) Never 
hesitate to use active ventilation when your crawlspace or basement needs it.
Installing a vapor barrier: Crawlspace finishing systems
Excessive dampness in a crawlspace or basement can condense, causing 
floor framing to become damp and covered with fungus, efflorescence, and 
rot. To avoid this damage to the floor framing, you can install a vapor barrier 
consisting of one or more layers of sheet plastic (6-mil Visqueen) on top of 
the soil in the crawlspace or basement (see Figure 4-6).
 
If you’d rather have someone else take on this less-than-desirable-job, an 
entirely new industry has cropped up consisting of firms that specialize in 
crawlspace finishing systems. The average system consists of a sheet plastic 
that is about ten times thicker than the DIY 6-mil stuff. They also use indus-
trial-strength tape, caulking on the walls, and an assortment of other tools and 
techniques that will make your crawlspace almost livable. Check in your local 
Yellow Pages or search online for “crawlspace finishing systems.”

Lap the plastic a minimum of 6 inches and seal the seams with duct tape. Cut 
around piers and along the inside edges of the foundation. In severe cases, 
you can run the plastic up the sides of piers and the foundation and secure it 
with duct tape or anchor it with a line of soil at the perimeter.
Just because you installed a vapor barrier doesn’t mean that your work 
under the house is done. With the plastic in place, you have a nice, dry sur-
face on which to work to remove efflorescence or mold that has propagated 
on wood framing. Wearing safety goggles, use a wire brush and a putty knife 
or paint scraper to clean the affected areas. (Also, see “Is there a fungus 
among us? Dealing with efflorescence,” earlier in this chapter.)
 
As you remove efflorescence or mold, have a blunt tool handy, such as a flat-
head screwdriver, to test for evidence of rot. If you can insert the blade of the 
screwdriver into the wood fibers using moderate pressure, it’s time to call in a 
pest-control specialist to make an inspection and suggest needed repairs.
Wood framing that was previously damp but not severely damaged should be 
treated with a wood preservative that contains a pesticide such as copper or 
zinc naphthenate. This wood preservative is a liquid that you can brush on 
with a disposable paintbrush.
 
Use extreme caution when working with wood preservatives that contain 
pesticides. They can be hazardous to your health — not to mention the fact 
that they have a fierce odor for the first week or so. Follow the manufacturer’s 
instructions on the label to the letter.

Saying oui to a French drain
If the advice we give in the previous sections doesn’t help, and you’re still 
faced with a crawlspace or basement that looks like the La Brea Tar Pits, it’s 
time to call in a soils engineer to determine whether the condition requires 
the installation of a French drain, an elaborate drainage system that consists 
of a trench filled with rocks and a perforated drainage pipe. The rock-filled 
trench, acting like a drainage ditch, collects water that easily travels through 
the rock and down to the pipe. The holes in the bottom of the pipe allow it to 
collect the water and direct to a point where it can be safely discharged.
If you already have a French drain, it needs maintenance. Clean the inside of 
the pipe once a year using a pressure cleaner, a high-powered water blaster 
with a hose and nozzle for specific use within drainpipes; you can rent this 
equipment from a tool-rental company. If you don’t want to clean the French 
drain yourself, have a plumbing contractor or a sewer- and drain-cleaning 
service do the job for you.
Tackling spalling and disintegration
Spalling, or chipping, occurs when water gets into the foundation, freezes, 
expands, and breaks away small pieces of the surface. Disintegration occurs 
for the same reason or can be due to attack by salt. Poorly mixed concrete is 
another cause of both of these conditions.
You can repair both spalling and disintegration with a latex patching com-
pound. Prevent spalling from happening in the future by applying a protective 
sealant, which helps to prevent salt air, water, and snow melt from attacking 
the foundation surface.
Not settling for settling
When the earth moves, so does the foundation — and so will the entire 
home. The result can be as simple as a squeaking floor, or it can cause major 
cracking in the foundation and every other part of the home. Doors and win-
dows can stick, glass in windows can break, and even sinks can chip.
Minimize damage by contacting a structural engineer as soon as you notice 
one of these symptoms. Repairs of this nature are always expensive, but if 
left unchecked, they can end up costing ten times more. With proper inter-
vention, you may be able to slow and even prevent future shifting.

 Chapter 4: Foundation and Floor Frame Fundamentals
Keeping Your Basement Dry
Finished or not, one place you don’t want water is in your basement. Besides 
yucky dampness, smelly mold, and funky fungus, there’s rust. Don’t worry 
about being all wet — we have solutions.
Basement water collection systems: 
The sump pump
The most common and effective basement water collection system is the sump 
pump. Basement water is directed, via drainage trenches and/or sloped floors, 
to a recessed cavity in the floor known as a sump. The sump cavity is outfitted 
with a drainage pump that draws water in the sump and pumps it up and out 
of the basement (or in some cases a crawlspace) to a safe discharge location. 
The sump pump is activated by a float valve; when the water in the sump rises, 
so does the valve, activating the pump. The pump continues to discharge 
water from the sump until the level drops enough to turn the float switch off.
 
Be sure to frequently check the float to ensure that it’s clean and moves freely. 
Every fall, check it by filling the sump with water.
Sump pumps run on 110-volt power, which often fails in heavy rains. If your 
system has a battery backup, make sure the battery is in good condition by 
running the sump a second time with the house power off. (Replacing a bat-
tery is a lot less expensive than a flooded basement.)
Check your owner’s manual for motor maintenance. Older sump-pump 
motors require minor lubrication.
 
The discharge line that travels up and out of the basement contains a check 
valve, which prevents discharge water from traveling back into the sump. This 
valve can occasionally become frozen shut. If, during your test, everything 
seems to be operational, but water remains in the sump, the check valve may 
need to be replaced.
What to do when it floods
Try as you might, the day may come when your basement actually floods. 
When that happens, you need to minimize the damage by doing the following:

66
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
 
✓ Turn off the electricity and call your electric company to report the flood.
 
✓ Turn off the gas to the water heater and furnace.
 
✓ Call your insurance company and report the circumstances.
 
✓ Arrange for remediation and cleanup immediately.
 
✓ Remove salvageable items as quickly as you can, and discard items that 
you can’t clean or that are contaminated.
 
 Protect yourself from sewage and other types of deadly contamination 
with hip boots, gloves, and goggles. And limit traffic in contaminated 
areas.
 
✓ If your basement flooded because of a sump-pump failure, call a plumber.
 
✓ After the water is gone, run dehumidifiers and fans until the units collect 
only a small amount of water over the course of a few days. Initially, the 
dehumidifiers will collect buckets of water. It may take several days — 
or longer — for the majority of the moisture to be collected.
 
Prematurely draining a basement that was fully flooded due to a natural 
disaster could cause a collapse. The flood waters in the saturated soil exert a 
tremendous amount of pressure on your basement walls, and the water within 
the basement is needed to resist that pressure. You have to allow the water in 
the soil to evaporate and seep deeply into the ground before your basement 
can be pumped dry; this evaporation can take a week or more, depending up 
how saturated the soil is.
The Floor Frame
If plywood were strong enough, we wouldn’t need a framed structure beneath 
it for support. Even better, there wouldn’t be anything beneath the plywood 
to go squeak in the night. Despite all the strength that the floor frame pro-
vides, it’s plagued with inherent problems. Builders have two fears in a newly 
built home — leaks and squeaks. A one-story home with a slab floor solves 
half the problems. Does that tell you anything about how inherent the prob-
lem really is?
Floors that go bump in the night
No matter what kind of finish flooring you may have — carpet, vinyl, tile, or 
hardwood — unless your home is built on a concrete slab, underneath it’s 
wood. And it’s that wood that causes the squeaks — well, sort of. Usually, 
the squeak is a loose nail rubbing inside the hole it was originally driven into. 

67
 Chapter 4: Foundation and Floor Frame Fundamentals
Lumber used to build homes contains a certain degree of natural moisture, 
which makes the wood easy to cut and minimizes splitting when it’s being 
nailed together. Unfortunately, as the wood dries, it shrinks — a natural pro-
cess that can take years. When the wood shrinks enough, once tightly seated 
nails can loosen and rub when the wood flexes below the pitter-patter of foot 
traffic, creating the familiar irritating sound: a floor squeak.
Boy, have we got good news for you: Floor squeaks aren’t difficult or expen-
sive to repair, and with a little guidance, you can avoid the frustrating part of 
the task: actually finding the cause of the squeak.
 
If you have company coming or you’re expecting houseguests for a week and 
you don’t have time to make the repair, try this temporary fix: talcum powder. 
We’ve found that talcum powder works particularly well in quieting a squeaky 
hardwood floor or wood stairs. Sprinkle a generous amount of the stuff wher-
ever the floor makes noise. Work the powder into the joints and around any 
exposed nail heads. Make sure that you completely remove the excess powder, 
because it can make the floor dangerously slippery. The relief lasts for a few 
weeks or months.
First up: Finding the squeak
The first step in repairing a floor squeak is to find the nail that’s rubbing up 
against the wood floor — a task akin to finding a needle in a haystack. Here’s 
a trick that we use to pinpoint a floor squeak so that we can make a repair: 
Use a short length of garden hose as a stethoscope. Hold one end of the hose 
to your ear and the other end on the floor while someone else walks across 
the floor to make it squeak (see Figure 4-7).
 
Figure 4-7: 
Finding floor 
squeaks.
 
Listen for squeaks.

68
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
 
If you can listen to the floor from a basement or subarea, the makeshift stetho-
scope yields more accurate results.
Fixing the squeak
If the problem is a loose subfloor (the wood floor beneath the carpet, vinyl, 
hardwood, and so on), the repair can get sticky depending upon the type of 
finish flooring you have. However, if access below is available (that is, you 
can get to the subfloor through the basement or crawlspace), installing a 
wood shim shingle between the subfloor and the floor joist is a quick and 
easy means of preventing the subfloor from flexing, and it quiets the squeak. 
Just squirt some carpenter’s glue on the thin end of the shingle and tap it in 
with a hammer (see Figure 4-8).
 
Figure 4-8: 
Tapping in a 
shingle with 
a hammer.
 
Tap in shingle with hammer.
 
Another means of quieting a squeaking floor by preventing it from flexing is a 
nifty gadget called a Squeak-Ender. It consists of a metal plate and threaded-rod 
assembly that’s screwed to the underside of the subfloor and a steel bracket. 
You slip the bracket beneath the joist and over the threaded rod; then you 
tighten a nut onto the rod to pull down the floor and close the gap. For more 
information on the Squeak-Ender, go to www.squeakender.com or call 800-
854-3577.
If access below is not available, after you locate the culprit nail, the next step 
is to create a better connection. Don’t use nails to make the repair — use 
screws. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Locate the squeak using the method discussed in the preceding section.

69
 Chapter 4: Foundation and Floor Frame Fundamentals
 
2. Near the existing squeaking nail, drill a small pilot hole through the 
carpet, pad, and wood subfloor and into the floor joist.
 
 The floor joist is the horizontal floor framing member that the wood 
subfloor is attached to. Drilling a small pilot hole makes the job easier. 
You can leave the old nail in place, or, if it’s loose, remove it using a nail 
puller or pry bar.
 
3. Drive a construction screw into the pilot hole, through the carpet, 
pad, and so on (see Figure 4-9).
 
 When working on a hardwood floor, countersink (recess) the screw head 
so that it can be concealed with hardwood putty. Use a putty knife to 
install hardwood putty. Touch up the floor finish with 400- to 600-grit 
wet/dry sandpaper.
 
Figure 4-9: 
Drive a 
screw in the 
pilot hole.
 
Drive a screw into the pilot hole.
 
We recommend construction screws because they’re easy to drive and they 
grip like crazy. You can purchase ones with a finish head (like a finish nail), 
which makes them a particularly good choice when working on a hardwood 
floor. You simply countersink them slightly and putty over them. You can also 
drive them directly through the carpet, pad, and subfloor and into a floor joist. 
A construction screw’s course threads and really sharp tip make it the perfect 
fastener for old, dry wood. The sharp tip gets through harder lumber easier, 
and the course screw threads go in faster and hold better.
If you do decide to use nails, choose a ring shank nail, which has a barbed 
shank for superior holding power. (Ask a clerk at the hardware store to help 
you find these nails if you don’t know what they look like.) Like construction 

70
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
screws, ring shank nails can be driven through the carpet and pad; however, due 
to the size of the nail head, they aren’t a good choice for hardwood flooring.
If the squeak persists, it may mean that your foundation has settled, in which 
case pier post shimming may be required. This process is similar to installing 
a shim shingle (discussed earlier). Instead, the shingle is inserted between 
the top of the pier post and the bottom of the girder (see Figure 4-10). Coat 
the end of the shingle with glue and tap it in snuggly using a hammer.

Still struggling with a squeaking floor? Major foundation settlement or an out-
of-level floor could be the problem; see the following section for more informa-
tion. Because this is a more expensive repair, you may want to consider the pos-
itive aspects of owning your own floor squeak. Think about how different the 
movie Psycho would’ve been if Janet Leigh had heard Anthony Perkins coming.
Getting on the level with your floors
Is a stroll across the floors in your home like negotiating the decks of a ship 
upon the high seas? If so, it’s probably time to consider leveling the floor. 
Out-of-level floors are not only nuisances to go across, but if severe enough, 

71
 Chapter 4: Foundation and Floor Frame Fundamentals
they can also become a real safety hazard. Out-of-level floors can also cause 
cracks over windows and doors or make doors and windows stick and 
tough to operate. Thus, by repairing your out-of-level floor, you may find the 
windows and doors in your home are a whole lot easier to operate and last 
longer. Talk about preventive maintenance!
 
Not sure whether your floor is out of level and by how much? Don’t head to the 
workshop to pull out a fancy level just yet. Simply swipe a marble (we like peer-
ies) out of the little tyke’s toy box and place it in various locations on the floor 
throughout the home. If the marble doesn’t stay put, your floor isn’t level.
If the marble test proves that your floor isn’t level, be prepared to venture into 
your basement or crawlspace to investigate and make the necessary repairs. 
Unfortunately, floor leveling can’t be done from above, unless you’re willing 
to tear out the finish flooring to install a troweled-on floor leveling compound. 
This alternative is rare and is typically only performed when flooring is being 
replaced. Furthermore, you’ll want to leave this one to the pros because the 
required material dries pretty fast — if you don’t know what you’re doing, you 
could end up with a bigger problem than you had before you started.
 
The majority of homes with floors not on the level probably didn’t start out 
that way. Poorly compacted soil, excessively damp or excessively dry soil, and 
shrinking support posts under the floor are a few of the most common causes 
of this condition. Homes constructed on a hillside, on soil that expands when 
wet, or in earthquake country fall into a totally different category. Although 
some of the fixes suggested in this section may indeed apply to these homes, 
chances are, the services of a licensed soil engineer and structural engineer 
will be required.
Plan A: Trying some easy fixes first
Before embarking on the floor-leveling project we describe in the next sec-
tion, we suggest that you take a simpler approach first: Start by stabiliz-
ing the moisture content of the soil near the foundation. Installing gutters 
and downspouts (and keeping them clean), installing downspout diverters 
(splash blocks), installing underground drainage systems, controlling land-
scape irrigation, and grading soil to shed away from the foundation are all 
effective means of controlling excessive moisture. (See “Preventing moisture 
under your home,” earlier in this chapter.)
 
Don’t expect miracles. This isn’t one of those conditions that will straighten 
itself out overnight. Depending upon the climate and temperature (based on 
the time of year that you take action), this passive stabilization process could 
take anywhere from a few weeks to the better part of a year. Try the marble 
test every month or so to see if your work is making a difference.
If controlling the moisture near your foundation doesn’t help or if there was a 
change for the good, but it simply wasn’t enough, you need to move to Plan B.

72
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
Plan B: Giving the support posts some support
If the easy fixes didn’t work, you can whip out that fancy level you’ve been 
dying to use.
 
All bubble levels are read the same way, regardless of length. True level is 
established when the bubble in the glass tube is located equally between the 
centermost lines on the glass vial. Lifting one end of the level will send the 
bubble in one direction while lifting the opposite end will send the bubble the 
other way. Playing with the level, raising and lowering one side or the other, 
will familiarize you with how it works.
Start your floor-leveling project with a 6-foot level and a Sherlock Holmes 
approach. Walk the floors of your home to identify the areas that appear out 
of level. Place the level over the floor in various directions and read the level 
to determine how far out of level it is. Repeating this process enough times in 
various locations will reveal where the high and low spots exist.
Now comes the fun part: Here’s where you get to work on your belly, side, or 
back in a space similar to that of graves in ancient times. Seriously, working 
under the house can be no fun, so make sure you wear coveralls, carry a drop 
light (what a mechanic uses when working under the hood of your car), and 
have the tools you’ll need with you:
 
✓ A few feet of replacement post material
 
✓ A couple metal connectors (see the following section)
 
✓ A handful of 8-penny nails
 
✓ A hammer
 
✓ A nail puller
 
✓ A sledgehammer
 
✓ A circular saw
 
✓ A hydraulic jack
 
✓ A screw jack and an adjustable wrench (if you’re installing a screw jack — 
see “Installing a screw jack,” later in this chapter)
 
✓ Some patience and, if you’re the least bit claustrophobic, some anti-anxi-
ety medication
 
✓ A helper topside to assist (because crawling in and out of the subarea 
can get old mighty fast)
Most crawlspaces are accessed in one of two ways: through an access door 
in the foundation (an opening in the foundation with a door or removable 
panel) or through a trap door somewhere inside the home (typically in the 
floor of a closet). If your house is on a concrete slab or has a full basement, 
you don’t have a crawlspace. Lucky you: No spiders to do battle with. Plus, if 

73
 Chapter 4: Foundation and Floor Frame Fundamentals
the support post that needs adjustment runs from your basement floor to the 
support framing of the floor above, you don’t have to work in a dark crawl-
space on your belly; you can work upright in a well-lit basement.
However, if you’re among the unfortunate, after you get into the crawlspace, 
you get to have a look around. Here’s what you’ll see: At the perimeter of 
the crawlspace is the foundation. The various piers are scattered about the 
interior. Atop these piers, which vary in depth from home to home, are sup-
port posts called underpinning posts. The bottoms of underpinning posts 
are attached to wood blocks embedded into the tops of the concrete piers. 
The tops of the underpinning posts are also fastened to floor support beams 
called girders. Sometimes the subfloor is attached directly to these girders; 
other times, for a more “beefy” floor, floor joists (horizontal floor framing) 
are installed above and perpendicular to the girders. The subfloor is then 
attached to the floor joist. In either case, the repair to the support posts is 
the same. Over time, the piers may either sink or rise depending upon the 
type of soil in which they’re embedded and how moist it is.
Installing new support posts
To install new support posts, follow these steps:
 
1. At those locations where the floor is high, place the floor jack atop a 
block of wood and directly under the support beam, a couple of feet 
from the pier.
 
2. Jack up the floor slightly (just enough to relieve any pressure on the 
existing support post) and knock out the existing post (see Figure 4-11).

3. Cut a new support post (shorter than the one removed by the amount 
calculated with your level from above) and place it between the pier 
and the support beam just like the one that you removed.
 
 To determine the length of the new support post, from above, place 
one end of the level on the high spot and direct the opposite end to a 
predetermined level area on the floor. Hold the level so that the bubble 
is between the centermost lines in the glass vial. Then, measure the dis-
tance between the bottom of the level and the level area of flooring. The 
new post should equal the length of the old post less the measurement 
taken with the level.
 
4. Slowly lower the jack until the support rests firmly on the new sup-
port post, and attach the new support post to the pier and the support 
beam with metal connectors held with 8-penny nails.
 
 Metal connectors are made of galvanized sheet metal fabricated to 
accommodate a specific size framing member. For example, the metal 
connector that would be used to anchor an underpinning post to the 
wood cap on a pier block is called a post bottom. In the case of a four-by-
four post, the post bottom is square (slightly larger than the size of the 
post and about 21/2 inches high) and has holes in all sides through which 
nails are driven. You drive nails through the holes in the bottom of the 
connector into the pier cap.
 
 A girder-to-post connector is used at the top of the underpinning post. 
This connector consists of two straps that attach to opposite sides of 
the post and two straps that attach to either side of the girder. As with 
the post bottom, this connector has holes in all the faces for nailing.
 
 Both connectors must be in place before the new post is installed. Use a 
short level to make sure that the post is plumb — at a right angle to hori-
zontal. Remember: The bubble in the glass vial needs to be centermost 
between the lines.
At the locations where the floor is low, the process is the same with one 
exception: The new support posts being installed need to be cut longer by 
the amount calculated with your level from above.
In some severe cases where the condition has existed for a long period, a 
deep saw cut may be required at the underside of the support beam in one 
or more locations to make the timber more yielding and to facilitate move-
ment of the floor up or down. The saw cut should penetrate approximately 
two-thirds the thickness of the timber. So, if the timber is 6 inches thick (mea-
sured vertically), the cut should be about 4 inches deep. For added strength, 
a splint consisting of short pieces of two-by-six should be glued and nailed 
with 16-penny nails onto either side of the support beam at the locations 
where cuts are made.

75
 Chapter 4: Foundation and Floor Frame Fundamentals
Installing a screw jack
If your home is built on expansive soil and, thus, subject to regular movement, 
a screw jack is the ticket (see Figure 4-12). Screw jacks, also known as adjustable 
floor jacks, are used in lieu of solid wood posts between the concrete piers in 
the crawlspace and the girders (horizontal beams) that support the floor joists.
A screw jack is a metal support post that can be adjusted to level the floor. 
It consists of two heavy steel pipes, one inside the other. The inside pipe is 
threaded and adjusted up and down by turning a large wing nut. The screw 
jack is attached with nails to the underside of the girder and to the wood 
block atop a concrete pier.
 
Figure 4-12: 
Using a 
screw jack 
to shore up 
your floor.
 
Screw jacks can generally be found at local hardware stores and home cen-
ters. Here’s how to install a screw jack:
 
1. Use a hydraulic jack and a short post to shore up the floor during this 
process.
 
2. Use a hammer, a nail puller, and a sledgehammer to remove the exist-
ing underpinning wood post and nails.

76
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
 
3. Center the screw jack below the girder and on top of the wood block 
on the concrete pier.
 
4. Adjust the screw jack so that the top and bottom plates are flush to the 
wood surfaces above and below.
 
5. Drive 16-penny nails through the holes in the plates and into the wood 
framing.
 
6. Lower the hydraulic jack to transfer the floor load to the new screw 
jack.
 
7. Adjust the screw jack up or down to achieve a level surface.
In some cases, when radically adjusting a floor, don’t be surprised if windows 
crack and doors stick. On the other hand, besides not having to take motion-
sickness medicine anymore, don’t be surprised if a few of those once-sticking 
doors and windows now operate just fine. It’s amazing what a little trek under 
the house can do!

In This Chapter
▶ Stopping leaks before they begin
▶ Discovering the destructive side of icicles
▶ Getting into gutters
▶ Painting for more than appearance
▶ Caring for siding
Your entire home and its contents depend on the integrity of your roof 
and exterior walls in the same way that you depend on protective cloth-
ing to keep you dry in foul weather. Getting temporarily stuck in bad weather 
can make you slightly uncomfortable and maybe even ruin your hairdo, but 
left unchecked, a roof leak — even a tiny one — can end up costing a fortune 
in damage to a home’s interior and its precious contents. Damage to flooring, 
plaster, wallboard, furniture, important papers, and more is no small matter. 
To avoid problems like these, you need to keep your roof and siding in good 
condition and repair. This chapter tells you how.
Your Roof: The Fifth Wall of Your Home
Most folks are pretty conscientious about maintaining the exterior walls 
of their homes. On just about any day during good weather, you can drive 
through a neighborhood and find the sides of at least one home under siege 
by painters. But rarely do you see anyone on the roof of a home unless the 
roof is being replaced. For some reason, people just don’t pay as much atten-
tion to their roofs, which we think is a mistake.
The whole idea of maintenance is to ensure longevity, reduce costs, and 
improve value. We think this concept should apply to the roof in the same 
way it does to the walls. In fact, we like to think of the roof as the fifth wall 
of the home — and we think the roof should be maintained with the same 
regularity as the walls that support it. With proper care and maintenance, 
a roof can outlast its warranty without leaking a drop or suffering any ugly 
damage.

Staying safe on the roof
 
A pitched roof is an alien plane. No, not a spaceship from another planet. Rather, 
it’s an unfamiliar surface to walk upon. And for the novice, an angled surface 
can be even more dangerous than the dastardly spaceships that tried to destroy 
the Earth in the movie War of the Worlds. To stay safe, follow this advice:
 
✓ If you aren’t agile or athletic, or if you have a fear of heights (or fall-
ing), think about hiring someone to maintain your roof. Your best bet 
would be a roofing contractor. He has the equipment, the know-how, 
and, best of all, the experience of working up high on an unlevel plane.
 
✓ If you do go up there, be sure to wear rubber-soled shoes. They grip 
better than leather.
 
✓ Wear a safety harness. Safety harnesses have fabric straps that wrap 
around your legs, your waist, and the trunk of your body, and you con-
nect them to a rope that’s securely anchored to a tree trunk — or other 
fixed and secure object — located on the other side of the roof. These 
harnesses could prevent broken bones or even save your life. You can 
find them online, at construction-supply stores or at a sports-supply or 
camping store that sells products for rock climbing and repelling.
 
 Be sure to adjust the slack in your safety line as you work your way up 
the roof. The less slack, the less sudden the stop!
 
✓ If you’re cleaning your roof, applying a preservative, or doing some 
other similar task, never stand downhill of your work. You can very 
easily slip on the wet surface. Always stand uphill of your work (see 
Figure 5-1).
 
✓ Use binoculars to inspect your roof. If you want to take a close look at 
your roof but don’t want to climb up there to do it, get a good pair of 
binoculars. Then you can stand on the ground and see what there is to 
see! Split wood shingles, shingles with holes, cupped and curling asphalt 
shingles, stains, mold, mildew, and other damage and wear will be as 
easy to spot as if you were standing right next to them.
Cleanliness is next to godliness
Streaking or discoloration can cause a perfectly good roof to look old, tired, 
and tattered. So, for appearance’s sake, keep your roof clean. You can use our 
Universal Roof-Cleaning Formula (see Chapter 20), which not only cleans off 
dirt but also gets rid of mildew, moss, and algae, all of which can cause exten-
sive damage if left unattended.

If you prefer not to make your own, you also can use one of dozens of com-
mercial roof cleaning solutions available. Although many of them simply con-
tain detergent and bleach like our recipe, others contain peroxide, fungicides, 
mildewcides, disinfectants, and other fancy fluids. Some are better at killing 
mold and mildew. Some are better at removing stains. Some are easier on 
your landscaping. In the end, though, they all work pretty much the same. 
To find out more about the options, visit your favorite home center or hard-
ware store.
To clean your roof, you need these supplies:
 
✓ Cleaning solution
 
✓ Safety glasses or goggles
 
✓ Pump garden sprayer
 
✓ Stiff-bristle broom
 
✓ Tall ladder (how tall depends on the height of your roof)
 
✓ Garden hose
 
✓ Safety harness

Choose a cool, humid, overcast day to make sure that the cleaner doesn’t dry 
too fast on the roof and then follow these steps:
 
1. Pour your cleaning solution into the garden sprayer.
 
2. While standing on the roof, spray the cleaner on a strip about 3 feet 
high and 10 feet wide and let it sit for about 15 minutes.
 
 Begin cleaning the lower portion of the roof, moving up as you clean 
each lower section. That way, you always stand on dry ground and 
reduce the chance of slipping (refer to Figure 5-1).
 
3. If the cleaner begins to dry out, spray on a bit more.
A few uplifting words about ladders
There are as many different ladders as there 
are tasks that require one. They range from the 
small two- and three-rung step-stool type to 
the common 6- and 8-foot folding models to the 
big daddy of them all, the extension ladder. If 
your home-maintenance budget can afford only 
one ladder, get a 6-foot stepladder. It gives you 
the length you need when tackling most home-
maintenance and repair projects. You can 
change light bulbs at ceiling-mounted fixtures 
and paint ceilings and walls. However, if your 
ceilings are 10 feet or greater, you need an 8-foot 
ladder instead. If your project involves a multistory 
roof, you need an extension ladder. (Whichever 
type of ladder you choose, be sure to check its 
posted weight capacity. The ladder must be able 
to carry your own weight plus your payload.)
Don’t try to save money by purchasing a cheap 
ladder. Cheap ladders fall apart in no time — 
usually with someone on them. When buying a 
ladder, look for secure connections, metal-sup-
ported steps, and superior hinges. As the ladder 
gets older, keep an eye out for loose connec-
tions, splits, cracks, and missing rivets.
Follow these tips to help you avoid any 
unplanned downward trips off your ladder:
 ✓ When working on dirt or turf, stabilize the 
ladder by placing the feet on boards or on a 
sheet of plywood to prevent them from sink-
ing into the earth. For added stability, place 
the bottom of the ladder away from the wall 
one-quarter of the ladder’s length; if you 
have an 8-foot ladder, place the bottom of 
the ladder 2 feet away from the wall.
 ✓ When working on the roof, make sure that 
the ladder extends a minimum of 2 feet 
above the edge of the roof.
 ✓ Never climb onto a roof from the gable end 
where the roof crosses the ladder rungs at an 
angle. Instead, mount the roof from a horizontal 
side. The plane of the roof should be paral-
lel to the ladder rungs at the point where 
you leave the ladder to mount the roof.
 ✓ To maintain proper balance, keep your hips 
between the side rails when climbing the 
ladder or when reaching out. Keep one hand 
on the ladder and the other free for work.

4. Use the broom to gently scrub the area as needed to get it clean.
 
 You don’t want to scrub off the granules from your asphalt shingles, or 
scrub your wood shingles loose.
 
5. Rinse the cleaned area with fresh water.
 
 Repeat the process until the roof is clean.
 
A wood-shake or shingle roof covered with pine needles, leaves, moss, and 
other debris may retain water, causing the shingles to rot prematurely. An 
annual sweeping with a stiff-bristle broom cuts down on fungus damage by 
enhancing proper watershed. Cleaning to promote proper watershed is impor-
tant with other types of roofs as well. Built-up debris can create a dam, which 
can cause a leak.
Replacing an asphalt shingle
Asphalt and fiberglass shingles, sometimes called composition shingles, are 
by far the most popular roofing material. Made of asphalt (tar), reinforced 
with fiberglass or other organic materials, and covered with mineral gran-
ules, they’re good looking, long lasting, and need very little maintenance. 
Composition shingles are more flexible and, therefore, somewhat more forgiv-
ing than wood shingles (see the next section).
 
Because composition shingles become more flexible when warm, replacing a 
shingle is best saved for a sunny day.
Here’s all you have to do to replace a composition shingle (see Figure 5-2):
 
1. Fold back the shingle(s) that are above the one you want to remove.
 
2. Use a flat pry bar to remove the nails that hold the damaged shingle 
in place.
 
3. Slip a new shingle in position to replace the one that was removed.
 
4. Nail the new shingle in place using a flat pry bar as a hammer 
extension.
 
 Using a flat pry bar as a hammer extension, you can drive the nail 
in from beneath an overlapping shingle. First, press the nail into the 
shingle by hand; then position the bottom of the flat pry bar so that the 
straight end rests atop the nail head; then strike the flat pry bar with a 
hammer. The offset below drives the nail home.

Preserving a wood-shake or shingle roof
If your wood roof-covering members are machine-sawn on both sides, they’re 
known as just plain shingles. If they’re hand-split (having a rough, ribbed sur-
face), they’re known as shaked shingles or shakes.
Regardless, no matter how clean you keep your wood roof, it usually starts look-
ing a little worn out after only a few years. Good Old Mr. Sun causes the majority 
of the damage, drying out shingles, causing them to split, and literally burning 
holes into them. These shingles can lose virtually all their moisture (water and 
natural resins) in as few as five years, which can result in cupping, curling, split-
ting, and an almost certain early demise. However, with proper care and main-
tenance, you could double or even triple the life of a wood-shake or shingle roof.

83
 Chapter 5: Roofing and Siding
 
Most preservative applications last three to five years depending upon the cli-
mate. Keeping the roof clean and debris-free helps extend the lasting quality of 
the preservative and, therefore, the life of the roof.

(phone: 503-897-2541; Web: www.cedar-guild.com/contact) and order its 
terrific “Double the Life of Your Roof Manual.”
Super-cleaning to open the pores
Preserving your roof begins with an even more thorough cleaning than the 
general roof-cleaning technique that we describe in the “Cleanliness is next to 
godliness” section, earlier in this chapter. It completely exposes all the pores 
of the wood so that the preservative you apply later can penetrate deeply 
and completely into every pore. This super-cleaning also cuts through grime 
and makes your wood-shake or shingle roof look almost as good as new.
Step 1: Pressure-washing
 
The first step in super-cleaning your roof is to pressure-wash it. We recom-
mend a pressure washer, a small device that converts water supplied from a 
garden hose to a high-pressure mix of air and water that comes through the 
hose with enough force to cut through soft wood. Talk about eliminating elbow 
grease! When using the pressure washer, hold the spray tip approximately 8 to 
12 inches from the roof’s surface while working backward from the lowest part 
of the roof up to the highest part.
Step 2: Getting rid of mold
When mold is present, follow the pressure-washing with an application of 
mold-killing bleach (1 quart bleach to 1 gallon hot water) to eliminate remain-
ing spores that may reside deep within the pores of the wood. Place the mix-
ture in a garden sprayer and thoroughly wet the entire roof. Keep it wet for at 
least 15 minutes and then rinse with fresh water.
Replacing damaged wood shingles
After super-cleaning the wood roof, let it dry and then follow these steps to 
replace any damaged shingles (see Figure 5-3):
 
1. Using a hacksaw, cut the nails anchoring a damaged shingle and care-
fully slip it out.
 
 Attempting to pry nails loose or pull a shingle out may damage sur-
rounding shingles and make it more difficult to install the new one.
 
2. Using the shingle you just removed as a pattern, custom-cut a replace-
ment shingle.

84
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
 
3. Slip the new shingle up and under the building paper until the butt 
end (the fat end) is within 1 inch of the ends of the shingles on either 
side of the new one.
 
4. Toenail (nail at an angle) two barbed roofing nails as high up as pos-
sible without damaging the butt end of the overlapping shingle.
 
5. Finish the repair by driving the shingle until it aligns with the sur-
rounding shingles.
 
 Place a wood block against the butt end of the new shingle and strike 
the block firmly with a hammer. This process conceals the new nails, 
providing a more watertight installation.

 Chapter 5: Roofing and Siding
Applying preservative to wood shingles
The preservative restores the natural oils to the wood fibers, safeguards the 
roof from fungus and rot, and protects the roof from the harmful ultraviolet 
rays of the sun. You see both oil-based and water-based preservatives at the 
stores; we prefer the oil-based type because it penetrates deeper, combats 
weather stress better, and lasts longer.
You can add pigments to non-pigmented preservatives to improve ultraviolet 
protection. An added benefit is that the pigment evens out the surface colors 
so that you can’t tell the difference between the older shingles and the new 
ones that were used to make patches.
What about other types of roofs?
A number of alternative roofing materials simu-
late traditional roof coverings. Synthetic and 
fiber-cement slate look like the real thing but 
are considerably cheaper and lighter — an 
important consideration in retrofitting. Metal, 
polymer, fiber-cement, and even rubber shakes 
offer a top fire rating and are an alternative for 
homes in areas where wood roofing is banned.
Of these alternative materials, metal is the 
fastest-growing. Here’s why: Unlike asphalt or 
wood shingles, metal doesn’t rot, crack, or grow 
fungus or algae. It can last more than 50 years. 
And if it’s installed properly, metal requires very 
little, if any, ongoing maintenance. All you can 
really do is screw it up by walking around on it. Be 
aware that metal roofing is more than just those 
big, flat, shiny panels you see on houses in the 
southeastern United States. Today, metal comes 
in profiles that mimic virtually every type of 
roofing material. You won’t believe what you can 
find — and you should see the colors available!
Sometimes we forget about tile roofs. They’re 
terribly expensive, and their use is virtually lim-
ited to homes with Mediterranean architecture. 
But they never need repair, and a well-installed 
tile roof can last up to 75 years. If a tile roof is 
appropriate for your home, it’s actually a good 
value when you spread the cost out over the life 
of the roof.
And that’s not all. Chemists, engineers, and 
wizards continue to work to develop new higher-
performance, eco-friendly roofing materials. 
Reflective shingles, heat-reflective roof under-
layment, systems that create an insulating air-
space beneath the roof covering, advances in 
waterproofing underlayment membranes, and so 
on are just the beginning. Although most of these 
new products are years away from being avail-
able to the public, we think their “green-ness” 
will help them succeed in the marketplace.

86
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
To apply the preservative, choose a calm, breeze-free day (to ensure that the 
majority of the product ends up on the roof and not on your neighbor’s new 
car). Then just spray the oil onto the roof, being sure to work backward from 
the low end to the high end and careful not to walk on an already treated 
area, which could be very slippery (refer to Figure 5-1). When the surface 
becomes shiny, stop spraying in that area and move on.
 
Although you can apply preservative with a garden-type pump sprayer, you 
can perform the task more professionally and in less time by using an airless 
paint sprayer, which you can rent from a paint store or tool-rental outlet.
The naked truth about flashing
Most apparent roof leaks are really flashing leaks. You can take super-good 
care of your roof and still get leaks if you don’t also take care of your flash-
ing. Here’s why: Roof flashing creates a watertight connection where the roof 
joins a wall, as when a first-story roof connects to a second-story wall. Roof 
flashing also creates watertight connections between the roofing and items 
that penetrate it, including plumbing pipes, furnace flues, skylights, and 
chimneys. Good, tight flashings around chimneys, vents, skylights, and wall-
roof junctions are the key to preventing water infiltration — and damage to 
walls, ceilings, insulation, and electrical systems.
Caulking around the flashing
The most effective way to prevent leaks is to keep a close eye on the places 
where flashings meet vertical surfaces. Prone to gaps where old caulk fails, 
those meeting points always must be well sealed. Use a good-quality exterior-
grade caulk and then follow these steps:
 
1. Scrape and wire-brush away any loose caulk, flaky paint, old adhe-
sive, and rust, if there is any.
 
 You can find rust-removal steps in the next section.
 
2. If the flashing is no longer stuck to the vertical surface, use a scraper 
to slide a smear of flashing adhesive on the back side of the flashing. 
Bend the flashing as little as possible. Hold until firmly adhered.
 
3. Caulk the edges to prevent water infiltration.
 
4. If desired, paint when dry to match the flashing color.
Removing rust
Although some flashings are made of lead or copper, most are made of gal-
vanized sheet metal or aluminum. And that means rust or corrosion. And 
rust or corrosion can mean leaks. So another way to prevent flashings from 

87
 Chapter 5: Roofing and Siding
leaking is to keep them from rusting. Applying a good coat of paint every few 
years generally does the trick.
You need the following items:
 
✓ A box of trisodium phosphate (TSP), mixed to the manufacturer’s 
specifications
 
✓ Sandpaper or a wire brush
 
✓ A paintbrush
 
✓ A can of rust converter
 
✓ A can of latex paint
Follow these steps to eliminate rust on your flashing:
 
1. Wash the surface with the TSP.
 
 The TSP etches (chemically roughens) the painted surface.
 
2. Use the sandpaper or the wire brush to remove all rust.
 
3. Clean away the dust and use the paintbrush to apply the rust converter.
 
 The rust converter acts as a primer while converting leftover rust to an 
inert material.
 
4. When the rust converter is dry, apply the latex paint as a finish coat.
 
 To make your roof flashings, vent pipes, and flue caps less obvious and 
more aesthetically pleasing, make them the same color as the roofing 
material.
 
One type of roof flashing, called vent pipe flashing, incorporates a rubber 
grommet held by a sheet of metal that seals the connection between a plumb-
ing vent pipe and the roof. This grommet is located at the centermost portion 
of the flashing and presses evenly all around the plumbing vent pipe. Do not 
paint the rubber section — ever. You can keep this rubber grommet in good 
condition by applying a rubber preservative every year or two.
Dealing with all that dam ice
If you have icicles, you may have an ice dam. And if you have an ice dam, 
you may soon be fighting a roof leak. Here’s why: When snow falls on a roof, 
it seals the roof, which becomes almost airtight. As the house warms to a 
nice toasty temperature, heated air escapes into the attic. As the attic gets 
warmer, it melts the snow on the roof, and water rushes downward toward 
the overhangs. The moment the liquefied snow hits the cold (uninsulated) 

88
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
overhang, it begins to freeze. The water that freezes after it rolls over the 
edge becomes icicles. Water that freezes before it rolls over the edge builds 
up to create a barrier known as an ice dam, which becomes larger and larger 
as runoff continues to freeze. Finally, the ice on the overhang widens to the 
point where it reaches the edge of the attic. At this point, the water remains 
liquid and the ice dam causes it to back up over the attic where it can leak 
into the home.
Ice buildup can also damage rain gutters, causing the need for costly repairs. 
By preventing ice buildup, you might be able to save your house from being 
flooded during a freeze and add a little life to your gutters as well.
To prevent an ice dam, you need to keep the underside of the roof in the attic 
cold. If the attic is cold, the snow on the roof won’t melt, and ice dams won’t 
form. Here’s how to make it happen:
 
✓ Don’t close off eave and roof vents during the winter. Sealing the vents 
traps the warm air that can melt the snow on the roof.
 
✓ Fill all penetrations between the living space and the attic area with 
foam sealant. You can buy expanding foam sealant in a spray can. Look 
for penetrations in the ceiling in the following places (many may be 
hidden beneath attic insulation):
 
• Plumbing vents
 
• Ventilation ducts
 
• Heat registers
 
• Electric wiring
 
• Ceiling light fixtures
 
 Any hole that can allow heat from the home into the attic is a bad thing.
 
 Don’t caulk around furnace flues. A flue that contains hot gases should 
not come into contact with combustibles such as wood or foam sealant. 
Contact your local heating or sheet-metal contractor and have a metal 
draft stop installed. The metal draft stop can be sealed to the pipe and 
the house frame without creating a fire hazard.
 
✓ Check your attic insulation. Be sure that your attic insulation is loose 
(as opposed to compacted) and that there is a more-than-sufficient 
amount of insulation up there. Look for gaps in insulation — especially 
at corners and at the perimeter where the walls and roof framing meet.
 
✓ Consider installing an eave-heating device such as heating tape or 
heating wire (see Figure 5-4). These devices prevent water from freez-
ing on your eave.
 
✓ Install special metal flashings at problem eaves. Ice doesn’t stick to the 
metal as readily as it does to most types of roofing. Metal flashings can 
be made to order by your local heating or sheet-metal contractor.

Finding a roof leak
The first step in repairing a leak is finding its point of origin. Finding a leak 
can be extremely difficult on a flat roof, so we recommend that, if you have 
a flat roof, you hire a roofing professional to find the leak and repair it. If you 
have a pitched roof, you can find the leak yourself. You’ll still probably need 
to hire a contractor to repair the leak, but being able to tell the contractor 
where the leak is saves time and shows the contractor that he’s dealing with 
an informed homeowner.
To find the origin of a leak on a pitched roof, you conduct a water test. 
Although it’s not difficult, water testing can be time-consuming and tedious. 
Be prepared to exercise a bit of patience. The process requires two people — 
one on the roof and one in the attic (or living space below if no attic exists). 
You also need the following tools:
 
✓ Ladder
 
✓ Garden hose
 
✓ Flashlight

90
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
Then follow these steps (see Figure 5-5):
 
1. Station your partner in the attic and tell her to holler at the first sign 
of water.
 
 Where’s the water coming from, you ask? From you, or, more precisely, 
from your garden hose, as explained in Step 2.
 
2. Use the garden hose to run a modest amount of water over the roof at 
a point below the area where a leak is suspected.
 
 Don’t run the hose full-blast, don’t use a spray nozzle, and don’t force 
the water between the shingles. Doing so may force water into the home, 
creating the illusion that you’ve found a leak when, in fact, you did noth-
ing more than temporarily create one.
 
 Work from the lowest point of the roof (near the eaves or gutters) in an 
area of about 4 to 6 feet wide. Work your way up the roof a couple of feet 
at a time.
 
3. Have your helper in the attic let you know the moment he sees water, 
and mark the spot with chalk.
 
 A loud yell will do the trick, but an inexpensive pair of kids’ walkie-talkies 
allows you to communicate clearly without yelling. Better yet, just have 
your cellphone with you and have her call you from her cellphone when 
she sees the water.

Getting Your Mind into the Gutter
Gene Kelly probably wouldn’t be remembered as well for his part in Singin’ in 
the Rain if the movie set had been equipped with rain gutters. As a matter of 
fact, the producers probably would’ve changed the title of the film to some-
thing like He Stayed Dry while Singing near the Rain.
Gutters are important. Because you’ll be singing in the rain indoors if you 
don’t properly maintain your gutters and downspouts.
Cleaning gutters and downspouts
Gutters and downspouts that are filled with debris can back up, causing roof 
leaks, rot at the overhang, and structural damage. At least once a year, you 
need to get up on the ladder and give those gutters and downspouts a good 
cleaning. Gutters that haven’t been cleaned for a while may be filled with a 
gross, mud-like muck, which you can scoop out with a small garden trowel or 
a medium-width putty knife. You may even want to invest $7 in a gutter scoop 
(a plastic trowel-like scoop made especially for cleaning gutters).
After you remove the majority of the debris, flush the rest away using a 
garden hose with a spray nozzle. If the water pressure at your place is weak, 
you can use a pressure washer to blast out debris. We both own pressure 
washers just for this purpose.
Patching up leaks
When galvanized sheet-metal gutters aren’t properly maintained (regularly 
cleaned and painted) they tend to rust. As we mention in the “Flashing” sec-
tion, earlier in this chapter, unpainted metal rusts, and rust results in leaks. 
The same technique used to maintain roof flashings can be enlisted on gutters.
When a rusty area turns into a leak, you can make a quick repair. To do so, 
you need the following tools:
 
✓ Wire brush (or a wire wheel mounted on an electric drill).
 
✓ Disposable paintbrush.
 
✓ Strips of tin foil or plastic (for pinhole leak repairs) or small strips of 
galvanized sheet metal (for larger hole repairs). Whether the strips are 
made of foil, plastic, or metal, they need to be just slightly larger than 
the hole being repaired.
 
✓ Rust converter.

92
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
 
✓ Paint.
 
✓ Roofing cement.
 
✓ Putty knife.
 
If the gutter is sagging, replace the mounting brackets before fixing leaks. You 
don’t want the gutter shape to change after the leak has been fixed — if the 
gutter changes shape, a patch could open.
With your tools assembled, follow these steps to patch the leak:
 
1. Use the wire brush or a wire wheel on a drill to remove as much rust 
from the area as possible.
 
2. Apply a coat of rust converter over the repair area.
 
 The converter renders any minute remnants of rust inert. With rust, you 
can’t be too careful. Allow the converter to dry completely.
 
3. Apply a 1/8-inch-thick coat of roof cement around the leak and, before 
the cement dries, add a strip of tin foil to the repair area (kind of like 
taping a Band-Aid to your arm). Use a putty knife to gently flatten the 
foil and squeeze out the excess cement.
 
 The total thickness of the repair should not exceed 1/16 inch. If you use 
too much cement, you may inadvertently create a dam.
 
 For larger repairs (bigger than a pinhole), use a piece of sheet metal 
instead of tin foil.
 
 For badly damaged areas, you can pop-rivet the sheet metal plates into 
place and seal them with gutter caulking, or you can leave this mainte-
nance task to the sheet-metal contractor.
 
4. With the foil (or a strip of sheet metal) in place, use a putty knife to 
add another thin layer of roof cement, completely covering the patch.
If the repair area is too large, then you should consider replacing the dam-
aged sections. The style you have is probably still available. But if, for some 
reason, the gutter profile on your home no longer is made, a sheet-metal con-
tractor can fabricate a perfect match.
Rust isn’t the only cause of leaks. Occasionally, a gutter seam or joint will 
open. Catching this problem early on reduces the chance of rust and, pos-
sibly, the need for a major repair. You can caulk seams in aluminum and 
galvanized sheet-metal gutters with a high-quality gutter caulking. Use poly-
urethane caulk for plastic gutters. In both cases, be sure to thoroughly clean 
and dry the area before applying the caulk.

93
 Chapter 5: Roofing and Siding
Maintaining gutter-protection systems
The whole idea of gutter-protection systems is that you don’t have to get up 
on a ladder and scoop the gloop out of the gutters every fall. But that doesn’t 
mean your “protected” gutters don’t need a little TLC every now and then. 
Some leaves, pine needles, and crud still get in. So instead of an annual clean-
ing, you probably can get away with cleaning them every two years.
Other, newer gutter-protection systems, including a product that resembles a 
bottle brush on steroids, are inconspicuous and easy to install. But don’t be 
fooled into thinking you’ll never need to do anything.
Siding: A Raincoat to Keep You Dry
Water can attack and damage wood siding. Stucco walls crack when the 
house shifts as winter rains expand soil. Metal siding dents easily. Vinyl 
siding pits as it oxidizes. Even bricks chip and crack with winter freezes and 
summer ground settlement. No surface is perfect; no material perfectly with-
stands the rigors of nature and the force of the elements. But you can do a 
thing or two to add life and beauty to your home’s siding.
Aluminum siding
Think of aluminum siding in the same way that you think of a car body. It’s a 
smooth metal surface covered with paint that needs to be regularly cleaned, 
polished, and waxed. Really, think about it. Aluminum siding is metal that 
is formed and polished and given a factory paint job just like a car body. So 
what automobile paint job do you know of that will last forever? The fact is 
that aluminum siding, like all the others, needs to be maintained and occa-
sionally painted.
Taking care of chalked paint
If you want to see a good case of chalked (oxidized) paint, then get up close 
and personal to a 20-year-old home sided with aluminum that has never been 
cleaned or painted. So, how do you prevent chalking? You can’t, but you can 
make light work of getting it to disappear. All you have to do is attend to it on 
a regular basis.
Pressure-wash regularly (once or twice a year), and don’t forget the laundry 
detergent. (Most pressure washers have a plastic “suction tube” that can 

94
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
draw the contents out of any container and blend it with the pressurized 
water. It’s a great accessory for incorporating cleaning chemicals and deter-
gents into the jet spray. Follow the pressure-washer recommendations for 
diluting the detergent — it’s usually one part detergent to one part water.) 
Your aluminum siding will remain bright and shiny for years. And the task 
won’t ever seem overwhelming.
Painting aluminum siding
When your aluminum siding begins to look worn and tattered, painting is in 
order. Follow these tips:
 
✓ Don’t scrape aluminum siding. Aluminum has a smooth surface and 
should be sanded with a finer 400- to 600-grit sandpaper.
 
✓ For bare aluminum, prime with a zinc-oxide primer (metal primer).
 
✓ Spray-paint the aluminum surface for best results.
 
✓ If you have to patch the surface, use a filler made especially for metal 
(like Bondo, which is made for cars).
Vinyl siding
Vinyl siding doesn’t warp, split, or buckle and, according to what several 
manufacturers espouse, it doesn’t ever have to be painted. Actually, it can’t 
be painted — paint simply will not stick to vinyl in the same way it sticks to 
wood or aluminum.
Like all types of exterior siding, vinyl does have its shortcomings. Over time, 
its surface oxidizes. As the surface deteriorates, the pitted result causes the 
material to become dull and prone to stain. The only way to combat this 
problem is to regularly clean the siding. Twice a year is good — once in the 
spring and then again in the fall. Use a pressure washer with laundry deter-
gent to get the surface sparkling clean.
Keeping the surface of the vinyl clean won’t prevent it from oxidizing, but it 
will prevent corrosive chemicals in the air from attacking the surface.
Stucco
Stucco is cool stuff. It doesn’t rot, and compared to other types of siding, 
it’s relatively easy to maintain. Stucco is very porous and holds on to paint 
better than most other kinds of siding. Also, it’s one of the easiest surfaces to 
prepare and paint. So, if you have stucco, count your blessings.

 Chapter 5: Roofing and Siding
Caring for cracks
The most challenging stucco maintenance is crack repair. Stucco’s tough but 
brittle surface sometimes can be a drawback. When the house shifts, rigid 
things crack.
 
You can turn your home into an interstate road map of ugly, obvious crack 
repairs if you aren’t careful. When it comes to stucco crack repair, less is 
more. Don’t try to patch every crack. Hairline cracks and those that you can’t 
get your fingernail into should not be patched; in fact, paint usually will fill 
those cracks. Wider cracks (those up to ¼ inch wide) should be filled with a 
high-quality, exterior-grade, acrylic latex caulk. Have a damp sponge handy to 
wipe away excess caulk that escapes.
Just follow these simple steps:
 
1. Clean all loose debris from the crack.
 
 The V end of an old-fashioned can opener and a vacuum cleaner work 
wonders here.
 
2. Use a paintable silicone caulk — and your finger — to make an invis-
ible repair.
 
 Don’t use a putty knife, because it prevents you from matching the 
existing texture. And don’t use just any caulk; use the 50-year kind, 
which really does hold better and longer than the other types.
 
3. With a damp sponge, wipe off the excess caulking in all directions.
 
4. While the caulk is still wet, place fine texturing sand into the palm 
of your hand and, holding your hand in front of the caulking, blow 
across the sand to scatter it onto the surface of the damp caulk.
 
 The sand makes the patch less obvious and prevents the road-map 
effect by helping the caulk blend into the surrounding finish.
Taking a chunk out of gouges
You can repair wider cracks and gouges with a stucco patching compound. 
Follow mixing instructions carefully because the amount of water you use can 
change the properties of the compound. If the properties of the compound 
change, it may not hold as well.
Follow these steps:
 
1. Clean all loose debris from the crack or gouge.
 
2. Use a latex patching product and a putty knife or trowel to fill 
the area.

96
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
 
3. Apply a second coat to match the surface texture.
 
 Thin the patching compound to a pancake-batter consistency. Dip the 
end of a paintbrush into the mixture. Holding your hand between the 
wall and the paintbrush, slap the handle of the brush against your hand. 
The patching compound splatters onto the surface, matching the texture 
of the stucco. If the texture is flat, wait for the splattering to become 
slightly firm and then wipe it to the desired flatness with a putty knife or 
a trowel.
Painting stucco
To paint stucco, use a roller for small jobs; for larger jobs, use an airless 
sprayer. A brush is not recommended for painting stucco, but you can use 
one to add texture: After you spray the paint onto the surface, use a deep-nap 
roller (3/4 inch to 1 inch) to work the paint into the surface and to achieve a 
uniform texture.
Although one coat may do the trick, stucco usually will require two coats, 
due to its high level of absorption and to conceal cracks and other repairs.
 
Really porous stucco absorbs gallons of paint. If you’re painting stucco for 
the first time, save paint by using a water hose to completely wet the surface 
of the stucco before painting. The water fills the pores in the stucco and pre-
vents the stucco from absorbing excess amounts of paint. Wait for surface 
water to evaporate first and then begin painting.
Wood siding
When wood’s moisture content reaches 20 percent to 30 percent, fungi deep 
within its fibers begin to grow and flourish, causing dreaded wood rot. To 
prevent wood rot, treat your wood siding with an application of oil, stain, or 
paint. These materials act as a barrier, preventing water from coming into 
direct contact with the wood.
Which finish you choose is mostly an aesthetic choice, although practical-
ities like ease of application, how long lasting the finish is, and so on are also 
factors:
 
✓ Oil, a clear finish, is absorbed into the wood and fills all pores and 
voids, displacing water that would otherwise be absorbed. It’s easier to 
apply than paint, and if the oil is clear (or almost clear), mistakes are 
nearly impossible to detect. In addition, oil doesn’t split, chip, or blister. 
Unfortunately, oil has a tendency to evaporate and doesn’t last as long 
as paint.

97
 Chapter 5: Roofing and Siding
 
✓ Oil stain is the same as oil except that a pigment has been mixed into 
the oil. The added pigment makes application of oil stains slightly more 
difficult (mistakes show more readily). But the pigment also helps to 
filter out more of the sun’s damaging ultraviolet rays. Like oil, oil stains 
don’t split, chip, or blister.
 
 The more wood that you can see when the job is complete, the more 
often you can expect to redo the finish.
 
✓ Paint penetrates and protects in the same way that oil does. 
Additionally, paint coats the surface of the wood with a thin, durable 
waterproof hide. Paint certainly lasts longer, but it is the most difficult to 
apply and is more prone to chipping, splitting, and blistering.
 
Everything’s a trade-off. With oil you won’t ever have to sand, scrape, or chisel 
the surface to prepare it for another application. But be ready to reapply a 
new coat every several years. With an oil stain, figure about three to five years 
of lasting quality. A good grade of paint, applied to a properly cleaned surface, 
lasts seven to ten years or more.
Paint experts agree that 80 percent of a good oil, stain, or paint job is in the 
preparation. But the exterior of your home is no small area, so when it comes 
to preparation (removing old layers of loose paint, a tattered layer of stain, a 
discolored layer of wood, or just plain dirt), you can expect to do some major 
work. Fortunately, tools like sand blasters, soda washers, and pressure wash-
ers are available at home centers, paint stores, and rental outlets; these tools 
help make cleanup and removal an almost fun job. All these tools involve 
some degree of work on your part, but they’re a breeze to use compared to a 
hand scraper, a hand chipper, or a blowtorch. Our personal choice is a pres-
sure washer.
Preparing painted surfaces
To prepare surfaces for repainting, follow these steps
 
1. Completely remove all old loose paint and sand the spots where a 
painted surface meets a bare spot.
 
 A new coat of paint won’t stick any better than the old paint below it; 
that’s why removing all loose paint is so important, and tapering or 
feathering these transition points makes them less visible and guaran-
tees a nicer looking finished product.
 
2. Prime all bare spots with a high-grade oil-based primer.
 
 Tinting a standard white primer a shade or two lighter than the finish 
coat can improve coverage. For example, a light-brown finish coat 
covers a beige primer more effectively than it covers a white primer.

98
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
 
3. Caulk all joints with a high-grade, 50-year, paintable silicone or poly-
urethane product.
 
 Doing so prevents water from getting behind the siding.
Now you’re ready to paint.
Preparing oiled surfaces
To prepare an oiled surface for refinishing, clean the wood with a pressure 
washer, apply a coat of wood bleach, let it stand (following the manufactur-
er’s instructions), and pressure-wash again. At this point, the wood is ready 
for a fresh coat of oil or oil stain. Your oiled siding will look so good, you 
won’t believe you did it yourself!

M
ost home-maintenance projects save you money over time. But 
only a few of them produce an immediate and measurable return. 
Maintaining your home’s energy envelope is one such project. The floors, 
walls, ceilings, doors, and windows of your home combine to make up its 
energy envelope. When the energy envelope is properly maintained, your per-
sonal comfort level reaps the benefits by better protecting you from the ele-
ments. And your wallet also notices a difference when you aren’t paying such 
high heating and cooling bills.
Saving Energy with Insulation
If your home is like most, your attic and exterior walls are insulated. If you’re 
really smart, you also have insulated floors. But if your home is at least 20 
years old, you may need to perform a little maintenance on your insulation. 
How will you know? Well, if you’re freezing, your furnace is running full bore, 
and there isn’t a window open in the house — well, you know. The good news 
is that insulation is pretty easy to maintain, as the following sections explain.
Looking at different types of insulation
Before you start adding insulation everywhere, take a few minutes to find out 
what kinds of insulation exist so that you can make a good decision about 
what you need and understand what you currently have.

100
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
Here are the basic categories of insulation:
 
✓ Loose-fill insulation: This kind of insulation is made out of small indi-
vidual chunks of fibers. It’s also known as blown insulation because it’s 
installed with a blower, a giant vacuum cleaner that works in reverse.
 
✓ Batt insulation: With batt insulation, insulative fibers are woven 
together to create a continuous blanket of material. Batt insulation is 
available in 16- and 24-inch-wide rolls (or 8-foot strips) to fit standard 
spacing between ceiling and wall framing members. A paper or foil 
moisture barrier is glued to one side of this type of insulation.
 
 When installing batt insulation, always place the side with the backing 
toward the inside of the home. For example, with ceilings, the backing 
goes down, and for floors, the backing faces up.
 
✓ Rigid insulation: Insulative fibers are tightly sandwiched together 
between two layers of foil, creating a solid insulative material that 
looks a lot like a thick sheet of plywood. Rigid insulation, typically 
used between the roof sheathing and the roof covering when no attic 
exists, is available in different thicknesses and insulative values. It 
can be used anywhere the batts or loose-fill insulation can be used, but 
rigid insulation isn’t always practical because of its rigidity and high 
cost.
 
✓ Spray-foam insulation: Spray-foam insulation works in the most con-
voluted and irregular places, expanding into places that other types 
of insulation can’t reach. The expanding foam also acts as an excellent 
water seal. Unfortunately, this type of insulation can only be installed 
into an open wall, so it’s an option only when you’re remodeling a room 
or adding on.
 
✓ Radiant-barrier insulation: Radiant-barrier insulation is nothing more 
than a lightweight aluminum fabric that blankets existing attic insula-
tion. Radiant barriers have hundreds of thousands of teeny-tiny holes 
that allow vapors to pass and prevent condensation from occurring at 
ceiling level. These barriers also reflect heat from above during summer, 
while at the same time holding in heat during winter. You install the bar-
rier as a single sheet.
 
✓ Duct insulation: The fabric of duct insulation is soft and pliable like so 
many other types, but it’s only 1 inch thick, comes in 1-foot-wide rolls, 
and is specifically made to be corkscrew-wrapped around ducting.
 
✓ Pipe insulation: Preformed, tubular, foam-pipe insulation has a specific 
use: to insulate water piping. This material is most available for 1/2 inch, 
3/4 inch, and 1-inch piping; is usually sold in 6-foot lengths; and is easy 
to cut with scissors or a razor knife. Each section of insulation is split 
lengthwise to ensure quick installation.

101
 Chapter 6: Windows, Exterior Doors, and Insulation
Getting the lowdown on 
insulation materials
Many of the categories of insulation noted in the preceding section are avail-
able in a number of insulation materials: fiberglass, rock wool, cellulose, and 
more. They all work. And you can mix and match them. If you have cellulose 
insulation, for example, and need more, you can add any type of fiber you want. 
You can also use batts over loose-fill material and loose-fill material over batts.
Here’s what we think about each type of insulation material:
 
✓ Fiberglass: Fiberglass insulation is the most popular and widely avail-
able type of insulation. You can buy it as either batts or loose fill. It’s 
relatively inexpensive, and the batts are very easy to install. It’s nonflam-
mable and resists damage from water.
 
 The fibers can irritate your skin and lungs, so take precautions while 
handling it. In addition to wearing protective clothing and goggles, take 
a cold shower after working with fiberglass insulation to help remove 
tiny fibers that make their way to your skin and cause you to itch. (Why 
a cold shower? Because a hot shower opens your pores and allows the 
pesky fibers more opportunity to make you uncomfortable.)
 
✓ Rock wool: Although it’s similar to fiberglass insulation, rock wool (also 
called mineral wool) is a little more expensive and somewhat more dif-
ficult to find, but it doesn’t usually provoke the same itchy reaction 
that fiberglass does. It looks a lot like dryer lint and can be just as dusty 
when handled. Rock wool can be blown in or poured in place. Rock 
wool can cake when wet and naturally settles over time, conditions that 
diminish its insulative value.
 
✓ Cellulose: Cellulose insulation is an organic, loose-fill material made 
from recycled paper chemically treated to resist moisture and pests. 
Moisture absorption can make cellulose heavier, causing it to pack down 
and lose its insulative value.
 
 If you have cellulose insulation in your walls or ceilings, the insulative 
value has probably diminished substantially since it was first installed. 
When loose-fill insulation compacts in walls, it should be vacuumed out 
so that fresh insulation can be added. Cellulose in the attic can be left in 
place and simply covered with new insulation.
 
Many insulation materials can irritate your skin and lungs, so whenever you 
work with any type of insulation, be sure to use gloves, a fabric mask, protec-
tive clothing, goggles, and a hat to reduce exposure. In addition, some insula-
tion is manufactured with formaldehyde — when buying insulation, check to 
ensure that the insulation you choose does not contain this nasty chemical.

102
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
Understanding R values
Insulation value is measured using what is known as R value. The higher the 
R number, the better the insulative value. R values vary widely between cli-
mate zones. Whereas an R value of 11 (R-11) may be recommended for your 
floor, your walls may need R-13, and your attic may need R-38.
Over the years, insulation requirements in homes have changed. R-19 was 
once sufficient for use in attics. Today, in moderate climates, R-30 is required. 
In extreme climates, R-60 may be necessary.
 
Check with the building department in your area to determine the correct 
R-value for each area of your home.
Adding insulation all over your house
We had been away from home for over three weeks. Before we left, we shut 
down all the mechanical systems — the water heater, air conditioner, and so on. 
The day we returned, the temperature was 104 degrees. But when we walked 
in the front door, we discovered that that house was cool and comfortable. We 
turned to each, making the same comment at the same time: “Good insulation.”
When it’s done well, nothing keeps on working — for free — like insulation. In 
this section, we walk you through all the parts of your home that should be 
insulated and tell you how to fill in the gaps.
Where to start: The attic
When you’ve got a problem with your insulation, the attic is the first place you 
should look. Believe it or not, most heat is lost through the ceiling — 60 percent 
or more. Properly maintained insulation can significantly reduce this heat loss.
The nice thing about attic insulation is that it doesn’t have to be glued, 
nailed, stapled, or otherwise held in place. All it does is lay there.
So if all it does is lay there, why would you ever need to do anything with 
insulation after it’s installed? Powerful air currents are created in your attic 
as air enters through eave vents and exits through higher vents. Natural air 
currents can actually move loose-fill insulation as if it’s being swept by a 
broom, resulting in piles of insulation in some areas and none in others. If 
you have loose-fill insulation, check to see if the insulation in your attic has 
shifted; if it has, you can use a plastic lawn rake to gently move the insulation 
from high spots onto the bald areas.

103
 Chapter 6: Windows, Exterior Doors, and Insulation
 
Notice that we said a plastic rake. With electrical wires present in the attic, you 
don’t want to use a metal rake.
You also can use a piece of batt insulation to fill a gap or a hole. Hey, it would 
save raking, and it can’t be easily blown out of place again. Just measure 
the approximate area to be filled, use a razor knife or a pair of scissors to 
cut pieces of batt insulation to the approximate length required, and lay the 
material in place.
If your insulation appears to be in good shape, but you still feel a chill, you 
may need to add more. Check with your local public utility or your local 
building department for advice on what to do.
 
Whether you’re filling holes or adding more, be sure to keep attic insula-
tion clear of light fixtures. Light boxes covered with insulation can overheat 
and result in a fire. And don’t plug your attic vents. An attic must be able to 
breathe; otherwise, hot air trapped in the attic can convert even the best-insu-
lated home into a sweatbox on a hot summer day. Plus, a buildup of humidity 
can occur, which, over a long period of time, can result in wood rot, mildew, 
mold, and fungus growth.
 
If you have traditional wood-framed skylights in your home, then you have 
skylight chases. A skylight chase is the walled area that immediately surrounds 
the skylight between the roof and the ceiling — it’s a vertical tunnel that runs 
through your attic from the ceiling to the roof. Skylight chases should also be 
insulated.
The walls
If mildew is growing on the inside surface of your exterior walls or if your 
exterior walls are sweating (you see excessive condensation), it may mean 
that there is no wall insulation or that the insulation has settled and is no 
longer effective. In either case, you need to add insulation.
Adding insulation to a wall is a bit more difficult than adding it to an attic (see 
the preceding section) because in a wall, the insulation is hidden between 
the interior and exterior wallcoverings. Removing the wallcovering to insu-
late the wall cavity just isn’t cost effective. It’s cheaper and easier to create 
small penetrations in the wall so that the insulation can be blown in. For that 
reason, blown insulation is usually the preferred choice when you have to re-
insulate a completed wall.
Insulating a completed wall is easy. You need an insulation blower (kind of 
like a giant tank-type vacuum cleaner that blows instead of sucks). You can 
rent insulation blowers, but some stores provide the machine at no charge 

104
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
when you purchase your insulation from them. In addition to an insulation 
blower, you need these tools and materials:
 
✓ A stud finder
 
✓ An electric drill
 
✓ A hole saw (slightly larger in diameter than the tip of the insulation 
blower)
 
✓ Blue masking tape (which is easier to remove than the regular kind of 
masking tape)
 
✓ Several bags of blown insulation
 
Should you blow the insulation in through the inside or outside walls of your 
home? It depends. Attacking the project from the interior is a bit messier but 
also less expensive. Plus, a perfect repair normally can’t be made to the exte-
rior wallcovering — regardless of type. However, if some portions of the inte-
rior side of the wall are covered with tile or other expensive finish, your next 
best bet is insulating from the outside.
Follow these steps to blow in insulation:
 
1. Use the stud finder to locate each stud and any horizontal blocks that 
exist at or near the center of the wall’s height; then mark each stud 
center and horizontal blocks with a piece of blue masking tape.
 
 Some homes have a horizontal block midway between the top and bottom 
of a wall cavity. Some have a diagonal row of blocks. Others have none.
 
2. Use the drill and hole saw to make a penetration (on center between 
each pair of studs) into the top of the cavity approximately 6 inches 
below the ceiling.
 
 Because studs are spaced every 16 inches or so, penetrations to add insu-
lation must be made at the same intervals, filling one cavity at a time.
 
 Save the discs of wall-covering material removed by the hole saw. When 
the project is complete, you (or a wallboard contractor) can use them to 
quickly patch the holes.
 
3. If the wall has horizontal or diagonal blocking, make an additional 
(second) penetration (on center between each pair of studs) an inch or 
so beneath the block.
 
4. If you find old compacted insulation within the wall, remove it with a 
vacuum.
 
5. Blow in the new insulation.
 
6. Repair the holes and clean up the mess.

105
 Chapter 6: Windows, Exterior Doors, and Insulation
 
Consider hiring a wallboard contractor to repair the holes. In an average 
home, they can be repaired for a few hundred dollars, and you’ll never be able 
to tell that the holes were there.
The floor
An insulated floor substantially reduces the loss of heat (thank you, energy 
gods), helps to eliminate mildew- and rot-causing condensation, and gener-
ally helps to keep your tootsies warm when you go barefoot through the 
kitchen. If you have hardwood floors, you should be especially interested in 
maintaining your floor insulation because lack of floor insulation can cause 
planks of hardwood flooring to twist, buckle, and curl.
Periodically (at least once a year), crawl beneath your home with a flashlight 
to check the condition of the floor insulation in your basement or sub-area to 
ensure that it’s properly positioned. Here, sagging is the biggest problem.
Floor insulation is normally held in place with netting or bailing wire attached 
from one joist-bottom to another. If the insulation netting sags, you need to 
reattach it or replace it:
 
✓ To reattach insulation netting, you can use nails or staples. Nails hold 
better but are hard to drive in tight spots. Staples are easier to install, 
but you may need to buy a tool (a construction-grade staple gun — 
known as a hammer tacker, which you can find at your local hardware 
store or home center). If the paper has become brittle and tears, staple 
or nail directly through the insulation.
 
✓ To replace insulation netting, lightning rods (named for their speedy 
installation) are a handy alternative to netting or bailing wire. These 
lightweight, flexible steel rods hold the insulation in place by spring ten-
sion. Just place one end of the rod against the side of a floor joist and 
bend it slightly so that the other end is forced into place against the face 
of the opposite joist (see Figure 6-1). Use one hand to hold up the insula-
tion and the other hand to whip the lightning rod into place. Lightning 
rods are available at hardware stores and home centers.
Pipes
Putting insulation around all accessible water pipes (see Figure 6-2) saves 
energy, prevents freezing during most moderate to medium chills, and 
reduces condensation when pipes flow through attics and crawlspaces. It’s 
also cheap insurance. A pipe that bursts in the crawlspace is no joy to expe-
rience or repair, but it’s bearable. A pipe that bursts in the attic is an alto-
gether different story. We know. Years ago, long before we were old enough to 
spell contractor (let alone be one) a pipe in our attic burst. What a mess!

Be sure that the tape that holds the insulation in place and the insulation 
itself are in good shape. If either the insulation or the tape crumbles to the 
touch, replace it. You can remove crumbling insulation with nothing more 
than a gentle tug. With the insulation removed, all you have to do is slip a 
new piece in place.
 
If you live in an area where temperatures frequently reach below freezing, and 
you’ve installed pipe heaters (wire or tape), don’t insulate these pipes without 
first getting the approval of the company that manufactures the pipe heaters. 
By the way, pipe heaters also deteriorate. If you see signs of deterioration or 
fraying, it may be time for replacement.
Heat ducts
As with other kinds of insulation, the material that surrounds your heat ducts 
reduces energy costs while improving the effectiveness of your central heat-
ing and cooling system. It also helps prevent unwanted condensation in attics 
and crawlspaces, thereby reducing the chance for mold, mildew, and the foul 
odors associated with them.

Reattaching and adjusting insulation
Insulation is wrapped around and around the duct in a corkscrew fashion 
(see Figure 6-3). Air currents, rodents, house movement, and vibration in 
the heating system can cause the insulation to loosen and fall away from 
the ducting. Reattaching or adjusting the insulation to cover the ducting is a 
good thing. While you’re there, add an extra layer — it couldn’t hurt.
 
You can “stitch” a nail into insulation to hold it together. You do this in the same 
way that a seamstress uses a sewing pin to hold two pieces of fabric together.

108
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
A thin layer of plastic, which acts as a vapor barrier, surrounds modern insu-
lated ducts and prevents moisture from attacking the insulation and the duct-
ing. If rodents or sloppy workers damage the thin plastic vapor barrier, use 
plastic sheeting (any kind) and metal tape to fix the barrier.
Metal tape looks like duct tape, except it’s shiny and won’t rot in moist areas 
where duct tape can. Actually, for small tears, just tape over the damaged 
area in the same way that you’d cover a cut with a Band-Aid. For areas of 
larger damage, use a piece of plastic as a patch held in place with metal tape. 
Make sure the tape seals all four sides of the patch.
Performing a duct leak test
Those same workers, house shifts, and pesky rodents also can cause duct 
damage that creates air leaks. This condition can result in major heat or cool-
ing loss and can substantially increase your energy bill. Therefore, checking 
for duct leaks can pay off big time. Because most ducting is covered with 
insulation, leaks can be hard to find.
Here are a few signs that may indicate a leak:
 
✓ Ducting that is crushed or badly bent
 
✓ Insulation that has darkened
 
✓ An area around the ducting that is warmer than normal in the winter or 
cooler than normal in the summer
If none of these conditions exist and you aren’t happy with your energy bill, hire 
a home-comfort specialist — a heating contractor — to perform a duct leak test. 
He’ll cap off all register outlets and pressurize the duct system. If pressure loss 
occurs, the contractor will search out the leak using smoke and then repair it.
Controlling air leaks in your 
ceilings, walls, and floors
There’s more to the energy envelope than maintaining insulation. You also 
need to perform another maintenance step, known as infiltration control 
(controlling air leaks through penetrations in ceilings, walls, and floors). No 
matter how much insulation you have in your home, if major air leaks exist, 
your insulation won’t work effectively.
Locating leaks
Unwanted air can leak into your home from all sorts of places: at weather strip-
ping, door and window frames, attic and sub-area plumbing and electrical pen-
etrations, heat registers, yes, and even electrical switches and receptacles. 

109
 Chapter 6: Windows, Exterior Doors, and Insulation
Infiltration also occurs where pipes and wires in walls penetrate into the attic 
or sub-area.
Here are tips for finding leaks in different areas of your home:
 
✓ In an attic or crawlspace: Finding a penetration in an attic or crawl-
space isn’t terribly difficult when it comes to plumbing pipes, flues and 
ventilation, and heating ducts. Just check the point where a pipe or duct 
penetrates the ceiling or floor and look for gaps.
 
✓ Around wiring: Finding penetrations around wiring — especially in an 
insulated area — is a challenge. Short of removing the insulation, you 
can’t see where penetrations exist because the wiring normally doesn’t 
stick up beyond the insulation like a pipe or a flue does. Therefore, you 
have to search through insulation until you find a point where a wire 
travels down through the top of a wall.
 
✓ In walls, ceilings, and floors: The amount of infiltration from walls, 
ceilings, and floors is simply amazing. Fortunately, you can easily 
locate these leaks in the myriad of places that they occur: around light 
switches, electric plugs, drain and water pipes, heat registers, thermo-
stats, wall and ceiling light fixtures, smoke and carbon monoxide detec-
tors, floor plugs, door bell chimes, doors, and windows. Just light a 
smoky incense stick — if leaks exist near the stick, the smoke flickers.
 
✓ Around windows and doors: When it comes to leaks, doors and win-
dows are major culprits. Even the slightest amount of house shift can 
cause a previously well-maintained and properly adjusted door or 
window to leak like a sieve. Check the weatherstripping on doors and 
windows twice each year: once during mid-spring when the soil around 
the house dries out and begins to shrink and the house begins to shift, 
and again during mid-winter when the soil around the house swells from 
moisture retention and the house begins to shift. Here’s an easy way to 
check for air leaks at the bottom of a door. At night, and from the out-
side of the door, point a flashlight toward the bottom of the door. If light 
can be seen from inside, an adjustment is needed.
Stopping infiltration
In the days when we were the maintenance men aboard the ark, we filled 
small cracks (no wider than 1/4 inch) with caulking. For larger openings, we 
stuffed insulation or steel wool into the gaps. For the largest and most gaping 
of holes, we used tin plates or wood covers.
Today, things have changed. Expanding polyurethane spray foam in a can is 
now available. No more time-consuming tin-plate installations or replacing 
insulation or steel wool that has fallen out. Simply spray a little expanding 
foam into the gap, and it immediately expands to permanently seal the hole 
(see Figure 6-4). Home maintenance in a can. What a country!

Where polyurethane spray is now best for large gaps, then and now, caulk-
ing is still best for narrow cracks. The kind of caulking to use depends on the 
area being caulked. Glass, metal, wood, plastic, and other surfaces respond 
differently to caulk. Read the manufacturer’s label carefully before making 
your purchase.
Another infiltration-control method is installing precut gasketing into electri-
cal switches and outlets. The gasket material consists of a thin foam that fits 
neatly between the plug or switch cover and the wall. Each gasket is precut 
to match either a plug cover or a switch.
 
If your electrical boxes aren’t gasketed, we suggest that you add them. An 
entire home can be done for under $50. Cover outlets on interior walls, too. 
Don’t forget that air can get into interior walls via wire and pipe holes that 
penetrate through to the attic and crawlspace.

 Chapter 6: Windows, Exterior Doors, and Insulation
Windows: See the Light, Feel the Cold
As beautiful as they are, most windows aren’t as energy efficient as an insu-
lated wall. Unfortunately, you can’t see through a wall. The R value (insulative 
value) of a typical wall is about R-13. (See “Understanding R values,” earlier in 
this chapter, for more information.) The R value of a typical window is about 
R-2. Even triple-pane windows have a low insulative value.
 
None of the window types or brands on the market today can compare to 
the recently developed highly energy-efficient windows that are available. 
Where current window brands offer an R value of R-2 or R-3, a new line of truly 
energy-efficient window offers R values of R-5 to R-13. (A solid wall in a moder-
ate climate has a rating of R-13.) Wouldn’t you like to have a window in your 
home that has the exact same insulative value as a wall? Manufactured by 
Serious Materials, these windows come in a range of insulative values from R-5 
to R-13 — depending on your budget. For more info about these windows, go 
to www.seriousmaterials.com or call 800-797-8159.
If highly efficient window replacement isn’t in your immediate future, here are 
a few maintenance suggestions for your windows that will make them a bit 
more energy efficient, add longevity to their existence, and make them easier 
to operate.
Dealing with water and air leaks
A window that leaks air can also mean excessive energy loss and cost. 
Summer or winter, you don’t want your house to leak air, especially if you 
spend your hard-earned dollars warming or cooling it. Test a window for 
leaks by burning an incense stick near all its joints and connections. If the 
smoke flickers, you have an air leak. Check:
 
✓ Where one section of the window meets another
 
✓ Where the windows meet the frame
 
✓ Where the frame meets the wall
You seal air leaks and water leaks in the same way — by caulking and replac-
ing weatherstripping. You can also inject foam sealant between the frame of 
the window and the frame of the house.

112
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
Caulking
Often water leaks at a window result from a breakdown in the connection 
between the window frame and the wall. To prevent leaks, caulk the window 
where it meets the exterior siding (see Figure 6-5). If the window is sur-
rounded by wood trim, use a high-grade polyurethane caulk to seal all gaps 
between the trim and the siding (and the trim and the window).
 
Take special care to seal the top side of the top piece of trim. Puddling water 
at this location causes many window leaks.
 
Figure 6-5: 
Caulking 
an outside 
window.
 
Expanding spray foam
If you’re willing to remove either your exterior or interior window trim, you 
can do a much better job of sealing window and door leaks — permanently! — 
than you can with just caulk. Using expanding foam not only prevents air 
infiltration, but it also makes the treated area watertight too.
Here’s how to do it:
 
1. Use a pry bar and a hammer to remove the window trim (either inside 
or outside — not both).
 
2. Fill the void with expanding spray foam in a can.
 
 Don’t worry about overfilling. Let it bulge out of the wall. What you don’t 
want to do is touch the foam while it’s wet; you’ll make a huge, hard-to-
clean-up mess.

113
 Chapter 6: Windows, Exterior Doors, and Insulation
 
3. After the foam dries (it’ll take several hours), use a razor knife to cut 
off the excess.
 
 We like to use a serrated knife from the kitchen. However, “borrowing” a 
knife is only possible when the boss isn’t home.
 
4. Replace the trim in the reverse order in which you removed it and 
touch up paint as necessary.
Weatherstripping
Leaks also occur when weatherstripping wears out. You may have to remove 
the operable portion of the window to find the weatherstripping:
 
✓ For sliding windows, open them halfway and lift the window out of the 
bottom track. Then pull the window out of the opening bottom first.
 
✓ For single-hung windows, usually you just release a lever on the side track(s) 
of the window frame. Contact the manufacturer for specific instructions.
After you remove the operable portion of the window, it becomes pretty obvi-
ous where the weatherstripping is and how it has to be replaced. Most home 
centers offer replacement weatherstripping in peel-and-stick rolls. If you 
aren’t sure about what to do, take the section that you removed to the store 
with you or photograph the area that needs attention. A picture is definitely 
worth a thousand words!
You may need an adhesive solvent to unstick old weatherstripping. Adhesive 
solvent is available in spray cans for easy application.
 
Adhesive remover can be pretty caustic stuff. Read the can to be sure that it 
won’t damage your window frame.
 
If you have metal or vinyl frame windows, check the drain holes at the outside 
edge of the bottom portion of the window frame. During rains, water can fill 
the bottom track, leak to the inside of the home, and literally flood the area 
surrounding the window. Drain or weep holes allow water to escape from the 
frame, preventing flooding. You can use a piece of wire or a small screwdriver 
blade to ensure that the holes are clear.
Preventing condensation
Condensation around windows can result when a window leaks air. Cold out-
side air mixes with warm inside air and creates a wet layer of condensation 

114
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
over the entire window. Condensation can actually form enough moisture to 
cause wood to rot. And don’t forget mildew. Condensation is a feed bag for 
mildew.
You can reduce condensation by:
 
✓ Sealing air leaks around windows (see the “Dealing with water and air 
leaks” section, earlier in this chapter)
 
✓ Replacing single-pane windows with double-pane “insulated” glass
 
✓ Using wood-frame windows
 
✓ Using storm windows
 
If you have insulated windows and you see rainbows or condensation between 
the two sheets of glass, then your window has failed and should be replaced. The 
frame can remain, but the glass must be replaced. Be sure to shop for the best 
guarantee. A failed insulated window is expensive to replace at $250 and up.
Maintaining storm windows
Storm windows are necessary when you have old, single-pane windows. A 
storm window is nothing more than a second window that adds insulative 
value to the window that it covers. We wouldn’t be surprised if yours are 50 
years old and tired. When storm windows are right, and when they don’t slip 
down and make gaps because of “tiredness,” they reduce heat loss and cold-
air infiltration. But dealing with them, no matter how old they are, can be a 
challenge.
As far as maintenance goes, here’s what you need to do:
 
✓ Take down the storm windows in the summer so that you can open 
your windows. Leaving them up year-round can cause rot to occur in 
the area between the storm window and the house. Also, ventilation is a 
must to reduce fungus growth in a home.
 
✓ Put the storm windows back up in the winter. Make sure that storm 
windows are properly sealed at their edges when they’re installed. Air 
leaking through the edges of a storm window can allow condensation to 
occur between it and the window it protects.
 
✓ Replace cracked panes. Leave this task to a pro.
 
✓ Clean the panes every time you take the windows down or put them 
back up. Use standard glass-cleaning methods.

115
 Chapter 6: Windows, Exterior Doors, and Insulation
 
✓ Wipe the frames with lacquer thinner. Lacquer thinner cleans off the 
weird aluminum corrosion and shines up the frames.
 
✓ Periodically (at least once a year), caulk the area between where 
the frames meet the walls and the sills. Be sure not to block the weep 
holes!
Why not replace storm windows? Cost. New storms for a house with 28 
custom-size windows will cost thousands of dollars and are probably only the 
second-best solution anyway. Many homeowners have done away with their 
storms and just replaced the windows entirely — but that costs $15,000 to 
$20,000.
Maintaining screens
Newer, more energy-efficient homes don’t allow for the passive exchange of 
air through cracks, gaps, and penetrations as older homes did. Unfortunately, 
this condition creates stale trapped air within the home. In addition, some 
of the components used in the fabrication of construction materials emit 
gases that cause health problems, which can range from a minor case of the 
sniffles to a full-blown allergic reaction. Air in the home must be continually 
exchanged with a fresh supply from the outside, which makes screens really 
important.
Cleaning screens
In order to get a good exchange of air, you have to keep your screens clean. 
Grit and grime can also hasten deterioration, thereby diminishing the life of 
a window screen. As if that weren’t enough, dirty screens also prevent light 
from making its way into your home. Finally, a gust of wind can blow dust 
from a screen straight into your home, aggravating allergies and increasing 
housekeeping chores.
To clean your screens, lay them flat on a smooth, cloth-covered surface, such 
as an old sheet on a picnic table. Scrub them gently with a soft nylon brush, 
rinse with a hose, and shake off excess water. We recommend pressure-wash-
ing your screens once in the spring and again in the fall.
Patching a screen
Screen patch kits are available at hardware stores and home centers. They’re 
inexpensive and easy to install (the process takes less than a minute). You 
can also use any of the following methods to repair small holes in window 
screens, depending upon the type of screen material:

116
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
 
✓ Apply a small amount of clear nail polish to a small hole or tear in a 
vinyl or fiberglass screen. The polish acts as an adhesive, sealing the 
damaged area.
 
✓ Mend small tears in metal or fiberglass screens with a dab of clear sili-
cone adhesive. If necessary, dab it on in successive layers until the tear 
is completely filled.
 
✓ You can darn small holes in metal screening. Simply unravel a strand 
or two from a piece of scrap screening and sew the hole shut, weaving 
the strands through the sound fabric with a needle (see Figure 6-6).
 
Figure 6-6: 
Left, darning 
a screen; 
right, patch-
ing a hole in 
a screen.
 
Large holes in metal screen material take a little more effort. Follow these 
steps:
 
1. Neatly trim the damaged area to a ravel-free square or rectangle using 
tin snips (metal shears).
 
2. Cut a piece of patch screen material that measures about 1 inch larger 
(in both directions) than the damaged area.
 
3. Unravel a couple of strands of material around the entire perimeter of 
the patch; then bend the unraveled ends at each side of the patch at 
90 degrees.
 
4. Place the patch over the damaged area and carefully thread the bent 
wires through the sound fabric (refer to Figure 6-6); then bend the 
wires flat again to hold the patch in place.
For large holes in fiberglass screening, simply cut a patch of similar material 
and affix it to the good material using transparent silicone glue.
Replacing a screen
Whether it’s a window or a door, rescreening is easy. There are two types of 
screen available: metal (copper, steel, aluminum, and so on) and fiberglass.

117
 Chapter 6: Windows, Exterior Doors, and Insulation
Rescreening with metal is slightly more difficult than with fiberglass (metal 
is not as flexible as fiberglass), but metal seems to stretch tighter, and it 
does last longer. However, where fiberglass screen material is not as strong 
as metal and often sags slightly once in place, it’s much easier to install. In 
either case both metal and fiberglass install in exactly the same fashion. You 
need the following tools and materials:
 
✓ The screen material of your choice — a few inches larger than the 
screen to be repaired in both width and height.
 
✓ A roll of screen spline of a size that matches the size you currently have. 
The spline is the rubber gasket material located all around one side of 
the screen’s frame that holds the screen in place.
 
✓ A spline roller (a tool that is composed of a grip with a rolling wheel at 
each end).
 
✓ A razor knife.
 
✓ An awl or ice pick.
 
✓ A large, flat work surface. The kitchen table covered with an old blanket 
or a piece of cardboard works well.
Replacement is pretty easy. Lay the screen spline side up on the work surface 
and then follow these steps:
 
1. Poke the awl into the old rubber spline and pull it out of its recess.
 
 When enough of the spline has been removed, you can pretty much do 
the rest by grabbing and pulling.
 
2. Remove and discard the old screen.
 
3. Lay the replacement screen centered over the frame.
 
4. At one corner, use your fingers to press the spline material into the 
spline groove in the frame.
 
5. When an inch or two of the spline is started, use the spline roller to 
steadily push the spline into its groove around the entire frame (see 
Figure 6-7).
 
 Keep the edge of the screen aligned with the frame and do one side first, 
and then the opposite side. Then do the top and finish with the bottom. 
Make sure to keep the screen taut. A helper may be in order here.
 
6. With the spline in place, cut the end and use the razor knife to remove 
the excess screen material.
 
 Place the razor knife in the outside edge of the spline groove, point-
ing the tip away from the spline. Gently wipe the razor knife along the 
groove. It will easily cut away the excess.

Buying new windows
Sometimes repairing or maintaining an old window isn’t worth the trouble. 
When replacement is the only alternative, it’s good to understand how 
window components differ to have a strategy for deciding what kind of 
window is best for you. When we get calls about windows on our radio pro-
gram, most people want to know “What brand?” That’s not the way we rec-
ommend approaching the decision. When we need a window, we choose the 
frame type first, then the glass configuration (how many layers), and finally 
the energy options (low-emissivity, gas filled, and so on).
Choosing a frame
Some frames are more energy efficient than others, some last longer than 
others, and some are just plain easier to maintain. Here’s a list of the frames 
in order from our most to least favorite:
 
✓ Clad wood frames: These are wood frames covered on the exterior 
with either a thin coat of aluminum or a thin coat of fiberglass. A frame 
made of wood is by far the most energy-efficient type. But, by itself, 
wood is a pain to maintain — painting, scraping, yuck! With a coating 
on the exterior, maintenance is reduced to almost nothing, offering the 
best of both worlds: energy efficiency and low maintenance. We prefer 
fiberglass over aluminum because fiberglass doesn’t dent as easily as 
aluminum.
 
✓ Composite and fiberglass frames: These frames are next best in energy 
efficiency and low maintenance. They won’t last half as long as clad 
wood, but they’re far less expensive.
 
✓ Metal frames: Metal frames are lowest on our list because they’re not at 
all energy efficient and they corrode faster than the others combined.

119
 Chapter 6: Windows, Exterior Doors, and Insulation
Choosing the glass
Choosing the correct glass configuration isn’t so easy. Here it’s more about 
money than anything else. Three panes are more energy efficient — and more 
expensive — than two panes.
 
Our advice? Select as many sheets of glass as you can possibly afford (with win-
dows, more is better) and have the glass coated with ultraviolet (UV) inhibitors. 
These protect carpets, drapes, and furniture and are well worth the investment.
Choosing energy options
Always be sure to ask for a window with a low-emissivity (low-E) coating or 
layer. Low-E windows are somewhat more energy efficient than windows 
without this coating.
Installing windows
There are two basic types of window installation:
 
✓ Replacement windows that fit inside the frame of the old window and 
that are designed to fit on top of the exterior wallcovering: These types of 
windows can be installed in just a few minutes and are sealed with caulking. 
In our opinion, they’re the worst choice. They’re a leak waiting to happen. 
No matter how much these windows are caulked, some of them always leak.
 
✓ Windows that are replaced in the same way as those that were origi-
nally installed: These windows look better, are more airtight, and usu-
ally don’t leak. This type of installation is three times as expensive as 
common replacement window installation, but it’s worth every penny. 
When a window frame is laced into surrounding siding paper and flash-
ings, it doesn’t need caulking to prevent leaks. With this type of installa-
tion, caulking is an added precaution, not a waterproofing must.
 
Don’t try to save money on window installation. If you do, it’ll come back to haunt 
you. And when the window contractor tells you that his caulking is the best 
and that it’ll hold for 60 years, call him a liar and throw him off your property.
Getting In and Out: Maintaining 
Exterior Doors
An exterior door may be more energy efficient than a window, but a door can 
leak just as much water and air. As the moisture content changes in soil, your 
home shifts. Your doors also shift, creating gaps large enough for a dump 

120
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
truck to pass through. Finally, doors can deteriorate and need to be regularly 
painted or varnished.
 
If you get tired of the often backbreaking maintenance that you have to perform 
to keep your wood front door looking presentable, look into a fiberglass or 
steel door and frame. They look better longer, are far easier to maintain, and are 
more secure than most wood doors. Where steel is not nearly as energy efficient 
as wood, fiberglass is far more energy efficient than both steel and wood.
With doors, you need to regularly caulk the exterior trim even if the exterior 
door in question is protected by a covered porch. (Remember: Caulking is 
designed to keep out air as well as water.) Caulk the doorframe to the door 
trim and the door trim to the exterior wallcovering.
Fixing leaks between the threshold 
and door bottom
If you find moisture on the entry floor, it could be a leak between the threshold 
and the door bottom. The threshold is the wood or metal platform at the base 
of the doorway. It usually tilts outward (to shed water). The bottoms of most 
exterior doors are fitted with a metal door bottom, or shoe, that houses a rubber 
gasket. The door shoe is attached to the bottom of the door with screws driven 
through oblong slots. The oblong slots allow the door bottom to be adjusted 
up and down as the house — and consequently the door — shift up and down. 
When the door is closed, the rubber gasket is supposed to rest tightly against 
the full length of the threshold, preventing the influx of air and water.
No matter how successfully the door shoe and threshold work to prevent air 
and water leaks, there could be yet another problem: The threshold itself might 
leak. Exterior door thresholds are normally laid in a thick bed of caulk when 
they’re installed. Occasionally, the caulk shrinks, and the threshold leaks.
The only way to prevent future leaks is to remove the threshold screws and 
force caulking into the area between the threshold and the floor. Make sure 
to heat the caulking first so that it’ll flow freely — a hairdryer works great. 
When the caulking begins to ooze out of the edges, stop the caulking process.
Stopping air leaks with weatherstripping 
and sealant
An air leak in a doorframe is pretty common. You can eliminate leaks by adding 
foam sealant between the frame of the door and the frame of the house. Simply 
remove the wood trim that covers the joint between the doorframe and the 
wall. (Use a flat pry bar to slowly remove the trim to avoid damaging it.) With 

121
 Chapter 6: Windows, Exterior Doors, and Insulation
the door trim removed, fill the void with expanding spray foam. (Don’t worry 
if it expands beyond the surface; once it dries — in a few hours — you can 
easily remove the extra with a knife.) With the excess foam trimmed, replace 
the trim and touch-up paint as necessary.
Leaks also can occur between the door and the doorframe. Check the condi-
tion of your weatherstripping to make sure that it’s in good condition and fits 
tightly to the door when closed. If your existing weatherstripping is tattered 
and in bad shape, replace it. We like the kind of weatherstripping that con-
sists of a rubber bead attached lengthwise to a strip of metal.
Here’s how to install new weatherstripping:
 
1. While standing outside the door, with the door in the closed position, 
gently press the rubber portion of the weatherstripping against the 
door and the metal strip against the frame — both at the same time.
 
2. While holding the weatherstripping in place, attach the metal section 
to the frame of the door with the nails or screws provided.
 
3. Oblong holes allow the weatherstripping to be adjusted back and forth 
during installation and later as house movement causes the door to shift.
Caring for wood and painting
Wood and water don’t mix. For that reason, exterior doors must be protected 
(painted or varnished) on a regular basis. Whether painting or varnishing, 
follow the same process:
 
1. Clean the door with TSP.
 
 TSP not only cleans but also etches the finish, creating a surface that the 
new paint or varnish will readily bond to.
 
2. Lightly sand imperfections and clean the entire door with a clean, lint-
free rag and paint thinner.
 
 You can also use a tack cloth (a cloth with a sticky substance that readily 
collects dust). Tack cloths are great for pre-paint cleaning.
 
3. Prime bare spots on painted doors and follow with your chosen finish 
coat as soon as the primed areas are dry. And don’t forget to paint all 
four edges of the door — top, bottom, hinge side, and strike side. The 
paint will thoroughly seal the door and prevent it from swelling, which 
can cause the door to rub or stick.
 
There is no perfect paint for an exterior door. Some experts say varnish, 
others say marine varnish (used for boats), others say water-based paint, and 
others say oil-based paint. We think they all work well. As long as you regu-
larly maintain your exterior doors, they’ll look good and last a long time.

122
Part II: The Energy Envelope 
Showing some love to your 
sliding glass doors
Did you ever reach out to open a sliding glass door, give it a tug, and feel like 
the door was pulling back? Unlike conventional exterior doors that swing on 
hinges, a sliding glass door moves on rollers. Little wheels made of neoprene 
or metal. Little wheels that wear out with use. Because the wheels on the 
bottom of a sliding glass door run in a threshold often filled with dirt and 
sand, it’s a wonder that they last more than a year or two.
If you have sliding glass doors, here’s how to convert loving care into lasting 
quality and a door that opens and closes as easy as pie: Keep them clean and 
lubricated, and adjust (or replace) the rollers as necessary. In the following 
sections, we explain how.
Keeping them clean and lubricated
Always keep the bottom track of the door clean and free of dirt and sand. In 
addition, regularly spray the track and the wheels with a waterless silicone 
spray. The absence of water in the spray reduces the chance for rusty wheels, 
and the silicone is a colorless lubricant that won’t stain or attract dust.
Adjusting (or replacing) the rollers as necessary
Just like other doors in the home, a sliding glass door can be knocked out 
of whack when the house shifts. Adjusting the wheels at the bottom of the 
door can compensate for this problem. Raising or lowering opposing wheels 
(located at the underside of each end of the door) can straighten a crooked 
door, allowing it to close parallel to the doorframe. Raising both wheels 
evenly can prevent the bottom of the door from rubbing on the track as the 
wheels wear out and become smaller.
For wheels that are adjustable, simply turn the adjacent screw. In most cases, 
you’ll find a hole at each end of the bottom track of the sliding door through 
which a screwdriver can be inserted. Use a pry bar to slightly lift the door to take 
pressure off the wheel while you turn the adjustment screw. If the door is low-
ered when you wanted to raise it, simply raise the door and turn the screw in the 
other direction. How’s that for getting the best bang for your sliding door buck?
Rollers that are completely worn out (or those that can’t be adjusted) can be 
replaced. Open the door about halfway, raise it 1 inch by forcing it into the 
top track, and, at the same time, pull out on the bottom. With the door out of 
the opening, snap the old rollers out and pop in a pair of new ones.
 
Depending upon the size (and weight) of the door, you may need a helper. 
Otherwise, you may be repairing a sheet of glass and your back.

In this part, we show you how to maintain your plumbing

T
his chapter is devoted to the water delivery system — the water pipes, 
if you will. They’re the thin pipes that run through the walls, basement, 
and attic, carrying water in and out. In contrast, drain, waste, and vent pipes 
are fatter and are not pressurized (filled with water under pressure); you can 
find out about them in Chapter 9. For the most part, water pipes are hidden 
in walls, attics, crawl spaces, basements, and below cabinets, and they 
require little or no maintenance — that is until they spring a leak or become 
so clogged that they deliver little more than a trickle. In this chapter, we help 
you deal with both of these issues along with a few other challenges that may 
spring up from time to time. We also tell you about getting the most out of 
your water heater and water softener.
 
Don’t confuse gas lines with water lines. They sometimes resemble each 
other — gas lines are often made of the same material as water lines, but 
gas lines travel from the gas main to fuel-burning appliances such as a water 
heater, range, furnace, or gas-powered dryer.

Thar She Blows! Turning Off 
Your Water Main
If you don’t already know where your water main is, read this section, and then 
put down this book and go out and find it. Don’t wait until an emergency to 
hunt for your water main — if you do, the consequences could be catastrophic.
The water main is typically located in a precast concrete vault in the front 
yard near the curb or below the sidewalk in front of your home. It has a con-
crete or metal lid that you have to remove to access the main water valve. In 
general, you can remove the lid by wedging a screwdriver into the slit in the 
top of the lid. If the lid hasn’t been removed in a while, you may need a small 
pry bar to free it from the vault.
Turning off the main water valve can sometimes be quite a chore. Although 
most main water valves can be turned using an adjustable crescent wrench 
(also known among friends as a “knuckle buster”), using a water-main wrench 
is easier, more effective, and safer. You can find a water-main wrench at your 
local home center or hardware store.
 
To prevent the main water valve from becoming difficult to operate, periodi-
cally turn the valve on and off.
Replacing a Damaged Section of Pipe
If your hardwood flooring is buckled and your crawl space is like a steam bath 
or your drywall is damp and covered with mold, chances are good that your 
water pipes have sprung a leak. The bad news is that even a pinhole leak can 
cause lots of damage. The good news is that you generally won’t need to tear 
up walls and rip out vast amounts of plumbing pipes. You can save the day 
(and lots of time and money) by replacing a damaged section of pipe.
Copper pipe
To remove and replace a piece of copper pipe, you need these supplies:
 
✓ A measuring tape
 
✓ A pencil

127
 Chapter 7: Plumbing, Part I: Pipes, Water Heaters, Water Softeners, and More
 
✓ A copper-pipe tubing cutter
 
✓ Fine sandpaper or emery paper
 
✓ Flux and a flux brush
 
✓ Solder
 
✓ A propane torch
 
✓ A short length of replacement copper pipe and two couplings (Note: 
The total length of the replacement piece of pipe and the two couplings, 
when fully assembled, must be about 3/4 inch longer than the length of 
the damaged pipe.)
To remove the damaged piece of pipe, follow these steps:
 
1. Turn off the main water shut-off valve; then open a faucet at the 
lowest point in the home (either the ground floor or, if you have one, 
the basement) to allow the line to empty.
 
2. Use a measuring tape to determine the length of pipe needed and use 
a pencil to transfer the measurement to the pipe.
 
 When figuring the overall length of the replacement piece of pipe, make 
sure to take into account the ends, which will slide into fittings.
 
3. Place the blade of the tube cutter over the mark on the pipe and 
gently clamp down on the pipe by turning the grip clockwise while 
rotating the cutter around the entire circumference of the pipe.
 
 The cutter should move freely. Applying too much pressure too fast will 
bend the end of the pipe and damage the cutting blade. A bent end can 
result in a leak.
 
4. Use the deburring blade located at the end of the tube cutter or a 
small file to remove any burrs at the cut end.
 
5. Polish the outside of the end to be soldered with emery paper until 
it has a bright finish. Do the same with the interior of the fitting to 
which it will be joined.
 
 This polishing cleans the material and provides the necessary tooth for 
a solid connection.
 
6. Apply a thin layer of flux to the outside of the pipe and the interior of 
the joint.
 
 Flux is an acid that further cleans the pipe and causes the solder to flow 
more evenly.
 
7. Assemble the pieces and rotate the pipe in the fitting to distribute the 
flux and ensure a secure fit.

128
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
 
8. Solder the connection.
 
 Soldering is not like welding, where the flame is placed directly on the 
connection. When soldering, the tip of the blue flame should be directed 
at the fitting, not the pipe, which allows the heat to radiate to the joint. 
When the flux begins to bubble, touch the end of the solder to one point 
of the joint and let capillary action do the work. The solder will auto-
matically form a tiny bead around the joint. Remove the flame as soon 
as the solder begins to flow. Be careful not to move or jiggle the pipe or 
fitting for about a minute after the flame has been removed — you want 
to allow the solder enough time to cool.
 
9. When the soldering is complete, remove the excess flux by wiping off 
the pipe and fittings with a clean, dry cloth.
 
10. Turn the water back on and check for leaks.
 
Using a torch can be dangerous, especially if you’re not experienced in its use. 
So keep these safety tips in mind when soldering:
 
✓ Wear safety glasses and gloves, as well as long pants and a long-sleeved 
shirt to avoid being burned by hot flying flux or solder.
 
✓ Have plenty of ventilation, especially if you’re working in tight situations.
 
✓ When working near wood, use a metal shield between the flame and the 
combustible surface to avoid causing a fire. Never use a torch around nat-
ural gas or gasoline, and always have a working fire extinguisher nearby.
Threaded pipe
Galvanized pipe is notorious for rust, corrosion, and leaks. When this hap-
pens, the most prudent solution for a permanent repair is to remove the dam-
aged section and replace it with a new section of threaded pipe. There are 
other stopgap emergency repair methods that may be used (mentioned later 
in this chapter), but we consider them temporary at best.
Replacing a section of threaded pipe is not nearly as difficult as you might 
imagine, thanks to the wide assortment of threaded sections of pipe that are 
now standard inventory at most hardware stores or home-improvement cen-
ters. These prefab sections come in various diameters and lengths. Many stores 
will custom-cut and thread a section of pipe if a stock item is not available.
To remove and replace threaded pipe, you need these supplies:
 
✓ Two medium-size pipe wrenches
 
✓ Hacksaw or reciprocating saw

129
 Chapter 7: Plumbing, Part I: Pipes, Water Heaters, Water Softeners, and More
 
✓ Penetrating oil or lubricant, like WD-40
 
✓ Two sections of replacement pipe and a union (Note: The total length 
of the two pieces of pipe and the union, when fully assembled, must 
equal the length of the damaged pipe.)
 
When calculating the overall length of material needed, measure from the face 
of one fitting to the face of the opposite fitting and add 1 inch. This accounts 
for 1/2 inch of threads at either end, which overlap into the fittings.
Removing the old pipe
To remove the old pipe, follow these steps:
 
1. Turn off the main water shut-off valve so that no water flows into your 
home.
 
2. Open a faucet at the lowest point in the home to allow the line to 
empty.
 
3. Cut through the damaged section using a hacksaw or a reciprocating 
saw so that the two pieces that remain can be unscrewed from the 
adjacent fittings.
 
4. Remove the existing pipe, using two medium pipe wrenches, one 
gripping the pipe and the other gripping the fitting), and then pry in 
opposing directions.
 
 Removing the old pipe from the fittings may prove difficult. Prying the 
two wrenches in opposite directions enhances the leverage needed to 
break the connection.
 
 If at first you don’t succeed in loosening the connection, spray the area 
with a penetrating oil or lubricant, such as WD-40, to break down some 
of the rust and corrosion that prevents the pipe from budging.
 
5. With the pipe removed, spray the threads within the fittings with 
more of the penetrating oil, and allow the oil to sit for approximately 
15 minutes.
 
6. After 15 minutes, use a small wire bottle brush to remove any residue, 
preparing the area for a new leak-free connection.
Picking up the pieces
With your replacement pieces (the two sections of pipe and the union) gath-
ered, follow these steps:
 
1. Apply a pipe joint compound to the threaded ends and the threads in 
the fittings, pressing the compound into the threads with a fingertip.

130
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
 
2. Insert the ring nut over one of the sections of pipe.
 
 The union is a fitting that consists of three components: two union nuts 
and a ring nut. The union nuts attach to the replacement sections of 
pipe where they join together. The ring nut acts to join the two pieces.
 
3. Screw both sections of pipe into their respective fittings (where the 
previously damaged sections were removed).
 
4. Tighten both sections of pipe and then the ring nut.
 
 Just as with the removal process, using two pipe wrenches makes reas-
sembly easier and safer.
After the section is replaced, complete the process by turning the main water 
supply on and checking for leaks. Your iron pipe will be as good as new — 
that is, until the next leak!
Protecting Pipes in Frigid Weather
When the mercury drops, your water pipes become increasingly vulnerable 
and may freeze and burst. When water freezes, it expands, and the pipes 
rupture. A burst water line can cause tens of thousands of dollars in damage 
and forever destroy personal possessions in the path of the raging water. The 
good news is that you can take steps to help prevent a burst pipe and the 
chaos that it causes.
An ounce of prevention
 
The following tips reduce the chances of your pipes freezing and help keep 
water running in your pipes all winter long:
 
✓ Turn on your faucets just a little. A faucet left dripping at the fixture 
farthest from the main water inlet allows just enough warm water move-
ment within the pipes to reduce the chance of a freeze.
 
✓ Insulate your above-ground pipes. Insulating pipes that are above ground 
(those that are most susceptible to freezing) prevents them from freez-
ing during most moderate-to-medium chills — even when faucets are off. 
Be sure to insulate pipes in the crawl space, basement, attic, and espe-
cially any that are located at the exterior, such as a main water line and 
shut-off valve. (See Chapter 4 for more information on insulating pipes.)
 
✓ Open your cabinets. If the pipes that supply water to your kitchen or 
bathroom sink faucets are prone to freezing, leave the cabinet doors 
open at night. The open doors allow warm air to circulate in the cabinet 
and warm the cold pipes.

131
 Chapter 7: Plumbing, Part I: Pipes, Water Heaters, Water Softeners, and More
 
✓ Install electric pipe cable. If you’re in an area where temperatures fre-
quently drop below freezing, think about purchasing pipe heating cable. 
They’re easy to install, inexpensive to operate, and can save a lot of 
heartache. Pipe heaters plug in to a standard outlet, and the tempera-
ture is controlled with a thermostat. All you have to do is wrap a wire 
around your water pipes — the heater does the rest.
Quick fixes for burst pipes
Being prepared to defend your home’s plumbing system against a sudden burst 
pipe can save you thousands of dollars in damage. Think of these quick, easy 
fixes as plumbing first aid — they slow or stop a leak long enough to give you 
time to enlist the services of a qualified plumber during business hours.
 
To temporarily stop a pinhole leak, you need to apply pressure to the opening. The 
solution? Wrap duct tape around the pipe. In many instances, it supplies the neces-
sary pressure. Unfortunately, duct tape doesn’t always give you enough pressure. 
In that case, you need to move to a more robust fix (see the next section).
Using a C-clamp when you need more pressure
Another way to temporarily stop a small leak involves a C-clamp, a block of 
wood, and a piece of rubber. Note: Because the block of wood is flat (and the 
pipe is round), it can only create pressure along a very narrow area of the pipe.
Follow these steps:
 
1. Turn off the water at the main shut-off valve.
 
2. Place a piece of rubber over the area where the pipe is leaking.
 
3. Put the block of wood on top of the piece of rubber.
 
4. Open the C-clamp wide enough to surround the pipe, the gasket mate-
rial, and the block of wood.
 
5. Place the stationary part of the opening of the C-clamp against the pipe 
(opposite the location of the leak) and the screw part of the C-clamp 
against the block of wood. Tighten the screw clamp until it’s snug.
 
Junkyards are filled with rubber that can be had for pennies. Old automotive 
radiator and heater hoses are just what the doctor ordered. If you have a 
friend who works on cars, he’ll probably be glad to give you all you need.
Using a sleeve clamp for larger leaks
A sleeve clamp stops everything from pinhole leaks to larger leaks. (Forget 
searching out a piece of rubber for this one — a sleeve clamp comes with its 
own gasket.) A sleeve clamp consists of two semicircular pieces of metal that, 

132
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
when put together, completely surround the pipe — hence, the name sleeve. 
The clamp is about 3 inches long, but you have to buy one to fit your specific 
pipe size — a sleeve clamp made to repair 1/2-inch pipe is smaller than one 
needed to repair 3/4-inch pipe.
Other than the sleeve clamp, you only need a screwdriver. Here’s how it 
works (see Figure 7-1):
 
1. Wrap the damaged section of pipe with the gasket material provided.
 
2. Surround the gasket-wrapped pipe with the two semicircular clamps.
 
3. Tighten the screws that connect the two halves of the sleeve clamp.
 
Figure 7-1: 
Using a 
sleeve 
clamp.
 
Rubber
 
No one relishes the idea of spending money on plumbing repair items on the 
off chance that they may be needed. But if you think about it, things like hose 
clamps, C-clamps, duct tape, and rubber are pretty cheap, especially when 
you consider how much money they can save you if your pipes do spring a 
leak. These simple items are good junk to have in your workshop.
Quieting Noisy Water Pipes
Imagine a fast-moving stream of water traveling down a narrow pipe. Suddenly 
and unexpectedly, the water finds a closed valve in place of what, moments 

133
 Chapter 7: Plumbing, Part I: Pipes, Water Heaters, Water Softeners, and More
earlier, was an escape point. All of a sudden, the water has nowhere to go. As 
it comes to an abrupt stop, a loud thud results, and it can be heard through-
out the entire house. This deafening sound is known as a water hammer. The 
hammering action that creates the horrible racket is actually capable of dam-
aging joints and connections in the pipe.
Combating water hammers 
with air chambers
An air chamber is a vertical pipe located in the wall cavity at the point near 
a faucet or valve where the water-supply pipe exits the wall. Air chambers 
act as cushions to prevent water from slamming against the piping. Because 
air compresses, it absorbs the shock of the fast-moving water before it 
has a chance to slam against the end of the pipe. Many household plumb-
ing systems have air chambers built in to them at critical locations — like 
the clothes washer and dishwasher — where electric shut-off valves close 
rapidly. In some homes, air chambers exist at every location where water is 
turned on and off — even the toilet.
To eliminate a water hammer, you need to replenish all the air chambers with 
air. You can’t inspect the air chambers, so this procedure is a must whenever 
you notice a faint noise in the pipe. Here’s how:
 
1. Shut off your home’s main water supply valve.
 
2. Open the highest faucet inside your house.
 
3. Find the lowest faucet on the property — it’s usually on the first floor 
somewhere outside or in the basement — and turn it on to completely 
drain all water from the pipes.
 
 As the water drains from the pipes, air automatically replaces it.
 
4. The moment the water is completely drained from the piping, turn off 
the lowest faucet and reopen the main valve.
 
 Air pushes out of the horizontal and open vertical water lines, sputtering 
as it exits the faucets inside. However, air remains in the air chambers, 
eliminating water hammer.
Tightening loose mounting straps
Sometimes a water hammer can occur when a pipe-mounting strap is loose. These 
straps consist of metal plumber’s tape or the vinyl-coated nail-in hooks and hang-
ers that attach pipes to roof, wall, and floor framing. A loose pipe strap allows 
the pipe to freely vibrate against framing members as water is turned on and off. 
Check all accessible pipes to ensure that they’re properly and tightly connected.

134
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
 
Never use galvanized plumber’s tape or galvanized straps on copper pipe. 
When different metals contact one another, electrolysis can occur, which can 
lead to a plumbing leak.
Adjusting too-high water pressure
Another reason for banging pipes is excessively high water pressure. You can 
adjust water pressure with a water-pressure regulator or pressure-reducing 
valve. Most modern homes have a regulator mounted at the location where 
the main water supply enters the home.
If you don’t have a regulator, consider having one installed. A professionally 
installed pressure regulator can cost several hundred dollars, but it’s a good 
investment in the long run. (Only do-it-yourselfers with some serious plumb-
ing skills should try to install a pressure regulator themselves.)
 
Not only is high water pressure wasteful, but it can damage dishwashers, ice-
makers, washing machines, and other water-supplied automatic appliances. In 
fact, many appliance warranties are voided when water pressure exceeds 100 
pounds per square inch (psi). Testing water pressure is important regardless 
of whether you have a pressure regulator.
You can test the water pressure yourself using a water-pressure gauge that 
screws onto a hose bib; in most communities, the water department will con-
duct the test at no charge. Normal water pressure runs between 30 and 55 
psi. If you already have a regulator, use a screwdriver or wrench to adjust it 
so that the pressure doesn’t exceed 50 psi (see Figure 7-2).
 
By the way, if you have low water pressure, consider adding a booster pump.
Some Like It Hot: Your Water Heater
Thanks to the water heater, it’s been a while since our modern civilized 
society heated water for daily use over an open flame. Instead, the dilemma 
facing most folks is one of short showers and high utility bills. If this situation 
sounds familiar, it’s time to take action! A bit of preventive maintenance on 
the water heater can provide hot water longer, result in energy savings, and 
even extend the life of the water heater.

Maintaining your water heater
A water heater, shown in Figure 7-3, has three basic parts: the enclosure, the 
water tank assembly, and the burner and control assembly. The enclosure 
holds everything together and protects the tank and other fragile parts from 
damage. The water tank stores water that arrives cold and leaves heated. 
The burner and control assembly are responsible for heating the water, dis-
charging combustion gases, and adjusting the temperature. An electric water 
heater varies slightly. It has an enclosure and a tank, but instead of a burner, 
it contains one or two electric elements that heat the water. Consequently, 
there is no need for a flue to exhaust combustion gases. Aside from these fun-
damental differences, gas and electric water heaters function essentially the 
same and require essentially the same tender loving care.

Insulating for improved efficiency
An insulation blanket can make some water heaters more energy efficient. If 
your water heater is located in unconditioned space (a garage, basement, 
or attic) or you don’t want added heat, install a heavy blanket — R-11 or 
better. The higher the R value, the thicker the blanket and the more insulat-
ing horsepower.
 
An insulation blanket is not recommended for a water heater located where its 
lost heat could be utilized. Nor is a blanket necessary if you have a new water 
heater that is factory insulated with R-16 or better. (The factory-installed insu-
lation is located between the metal shell and the tank, so don’t worry if you 
can’t see it.) The manufacturer’s label will tell you how much insulation your 
water heater contains.

137
 Chapter 7: Plumbing, Part I: Pipes, Water Heaters, Water Softeners, and More
You purchase a water-heater insulation blanket as a kit based on the size of 
the heater — 30 gallons, 40 gallons, 50 gallons, and so on. The kit contains a 
blanket that’s finished with white vinyl on the outside and raw insulation on 
the inside and enough adhesive tape to finish the seams.
Here’s how to wrap your water heater with an insulation blanket:
 
✓ If you have a gas water heater: Wrap your gas water heater all the way 
around and from the top to just below the controller. Don’t worry if the 
blanket seems a bit short. Remember: The bottom of the tank is several 
inches above the very bottom of the water heater — a couple of inches 
below the drain valve.
 
 Don’t wrap the top of a gas water heater because the insulation could catch 
fire from the heat being exhausted. Also, the blanket should not cover the 
controller, the anode, or the pressure and temperature relief valve.
 
✓ If you have an electric water heater: Because electric water heaters 
have no exhaust, you can insulate the sides and the top. But to prevent 
electrical components from overheating, don’t cover the heating-ele-
ment access panels.
Keeping your water heater clear of sludge
If the bottom of your water heater fills with sludge, the heater won’t operate at 
peak performance. Aside from being a breeding ground for bacteria, sediment 
at the base of a tank significantly diminishes the efficiency of a gas water heater 
and can cause it to rumble like a freight train. Sediment buildup also causes the 
water at the base of the tank to super-heat and turn to steam, resulting in mini 
explosions that blast small amounts of sediment off the bottom of the tank.
To clean the sediment out of a water heater, follow these steps:
 
1. Turn off the power to the water heater and the cold-water inlet valve 
at the top of the water heater.
 
2. Unscrew the cold-water supply line at the top of the water heater and 
remove the nipple screwed into the cold-water port.
 
3. Pour a citric-acid-based cleaner into the open hole and wait about eight 
hours for the acid to dissolve the minerals at the bottom of the tank.
 
 The citric-acid-based cleaning product we recommend is called Mag-
Erad, but it can sometimes be hard to find at local plumbing supply 
stores. If you have trouble finding it, call the Mag-Erad manufacturer, Tri-
Brothers Chemical Corporation at 847-564-2320, or contact A. O. Smith 
Distributors at 800-845-1108 or 800-527-1953.
 
4. After the cleaning agent has had time to work, flush the tank.
 
 Connect a garden hose to the drain valve located at the bottom of the 
water heater and run the hose out into the garden. Open the drain valve, 

138
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
reconnect the cold-water supply line and then turn on the cold-water 
supply to the water heater. The cloudy water and sediment that comes 
out of the end of the hose will amaze you.
 
5. When the water runs clear, close the drain valve, and remove the hose.
 
6. Bleed air from the system by turning on the hot-water faucet farthest 
from the water heater; when water runs from this faucet, turn it off 
and repeat this process at other faucets throughout the house.
 
7. Turn the power to the water heater back on.
Hopefully, you’ll be in hot water now.
Avoiding rust
Most water-heater tanks are made of glass-lined steel. If water gets through 
imperfections in the glass, then you can count on rust and eventually a leak. 
But because the tank has no inspection ports, it’s hard to tell when it’s dirty or 
beginning to rust. Actually, tank rust usually isn’t discovered until after a leak 
occurs — and then it’s too late. You’re not totally without recourse, though.
A special rod called a cathodic anode (or sacrificial anode) is built in to the 
water-heater tank assembly to prevent rust. As long as the rod is in good con-
dition, deterioration of the tank is drastically reduced.
Unfortunately, you can’t determine the condition of the anode by just look-
ing at your water heater. You have to turn off the power and the water to 
the water heater and remove the anode with a wrench. Check the anode for 
deterioration at least twice a year; this will give you an idea of how long the 
anode will last. You can then include its replacement in your maintenance 
schedule accordingly.
To prevent damage to the tank, simply replace the cathodic anode, a $15 
item that takes about 30 minutes to install. Cathodic anodes are often not 
readily available in hardware stores — you’ll probably have to buy one from 
a plumbing-supply company. Because anodes come in all shapes and sizes, 
be prepared to give them the make and model of your water heater so that 
you get the right one. You can find this information on a label located on the 
water-heater housing.
To replace the cathodic anode, follow these steps:
 
1. Turn off the power to the water heater and the cold-water inlet valve 
at the top of the water heater.
 
2. Unscrew the hex bolt holding the cathodic anode in place and remove 
the rod — or what remains of it.
 
 You may discover that only a short piece of rusted metal rod remains — 
definitely a sign that a new anode is desperately needed.

139
 Chapter 7: Plumbing, Part I: Pipes, Water Heaters, Water Softeners, and More
 
 The cathodic anode is about 3 to 5 feet long, about 3/4 inch in diameter, 
and has a hex bolt welded onto one end. The hex bolt screws into the 
top of the tank, holding the rod in place inside the tank, and, when tight-
ened down, the nut also makes a watertight seal at the same time.
 
3. Install the new anode.
 
 Insert the new anode in the reverse order that the previous one was 
removed. Be sure to use Teflon tape on the threaded fitting to prevent 
a leak.
 
4. Turn the water and power to the water heater back on.
 
Most factory-installed anodes are magnesium, which can produce a sulfite-
reducing bacteria that makes your water smell like rotten eggs. Using a replace-
ment anode made of zinc or aluminum will prevent this problem. Peeeww!
When things get too hot
Water temperature is another important factor in controlling energy costs 
and extending a water heater’s life span. Water-heater manufacturers recom-
mend a lower water temperature setting whenever possible — 130 degrees 
or less. On a gas water heater, you can adjust the temperature by turning the 
dial located on the front of the controller. On an electric model, the thermo-
stat is located behind an access panel adjacent to a heating element.
 
Don’t set the temperature below 120 degrees. A temperature setting less than 
that could allow potentially fatal bacteria to propagate within the tank.
Testing the temperature and pressure relief valve
The temperature and pressure relief valve (TPR valve) opens to release pres-
sure buildup in the water heater when the temperature or the pressure get 
dangerously high, preventing a possible explosion.
A buildup of mineral salt, rust, and corrosion can cause a TPR valve to freeze 
up and become nonoperational. To test the valve to ensure that it’s working 
properly, simply raise and lower the test lever several times so it lifts the 
brass stem that it’s fastened to (see Figure 7-4). Hot water should rush out of 
the end of the drainpipe. If no water flows through the pipe or you get just a 
trickle, replace the valve.
Some water-heater experts recommend testing every six months. More 
frequent testing can reduce the chance of a leak caused by mineral and cor-
rosion buildup. However, if a leak results immediately after a test, simply 
operate the test lever several times to free lodged debris that may be pre-
venting the valve from seating properly. If the valve is doing its job and hot 
water is dripping or spewing out of the TPR drain valve, turn down the tem-
perature on the water-heater controller and/or turn down the water pressure 
(see “Adjusting too-high water pressure,” earlier in this chapter), if necessary.

140
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
 
Figure 7-4: 
Testing the

and pres-
sure valve.
 
Here are other things to pay attention to:
 
✓ The pipe leaving the relief valve should be the same diameter as the 
exhaust port of the valve — usually 3/4 inch. Moreover, the pipe should 
be made of a material that is not adversely affected by heat, such as 
copper. If the pipe is undersized or not heat-resistant, replace it with 
copper or have a plumber do it for you.
 
✓ The TPR drainpipe should travel in a slightly downhill direction from 
the valve to the point where it terminates. It should end outside the 
house at 6 to 24 inches above the ground. If the drainpipe moves uphill 
and then downhill, water could get trapped against the outlet of the 
valve and corrode it shut. If the drain line had a trap or a low spot, water 
could freeze. And even if the valve works, pressure would be captured 
and an explosion might occur. If the drainpipe isn’t properly configured, 
call in a plumber to correct it.
Dealing with a sudden blast of cold water
When the hot water in your shower suddenly turns ice cold, you have the 
right to be frustrated and confused. (That is, if the hot-water supply hasn’t 
been drained due to recent use.) If you receive this rude wake-up call, the 
culprit may be that your dip tube or the water-heater nipples need a 
little TLC.
Caring for a broken dip tube
The dip tube consists of a plastic pipe that travels vertically within the water-
heater tank from the cold-water inlet to within a few inches of the bottom of 
the tank. The dip tube brings cold water in the bottom of the tank where it 
can be heated. If the dip tube is cracked or broken, the cold water mixes with 

141
 Chapter 7: Plumbing, Part I: Pipes, Water Heaters, Water Softeners, and More
the hot water at the top of the tank (heat and hot water rise), resulting in 
your unwelcome early-morning shock. When this condition arises, a cracked 
or broken dip tube is usually to blame.
Changing a dip tube is easy:
 
1. Turn off the power to the water heater.
 
2. Turn the cold-water inlet valve off and use a wrench to disconnect the 
cold-water supply line at the top of the water heater.
 
3. Remove the nipple (a short piece of pipe threaded at both ends) to 
expose the top of the dip tube.
 
4. Remove the dip tube by inserting a screwdriver at an angle and using 
friction to pry the tube out of the opening.
 
5. Drop a new tube into the opening and replace the nipple and supply line.
 
6. Turn on the water and restore power to the unit.
Nipples: A sensitive subject
Nipples are short pieces of pipe that are threaded on both ends. They come 
in various lengths and diameters and are made of a host of materials. Most 
water heaters have two nipples that are used to connect the cold-water 
supply line and hot-water outlet line at the top of the water heater. These nip-
ples are subject to corrosion and a buildup of solids at the interior that can 
bring your supply of hot water to little more than a disappointing drip.
You can solve this problem by installing PVC-lined nipples, galvanized iron 
nipples lined with plastic or PVC that prevents mineral buildup on the inside. 
The galvanized finish helps prevent rust on the outside. Use Teflon tape on 
the threads for a leak-free seal. Also, make sure to use dielectric unions to 
connect all dissimilar metal water pipes to prevent electrolysis — a deteriora-
tion that occurs when unlike metals come into contact with one another.
The cold-water shut-off valve
If you discover rust at the top of your water heater — aside from the nipples — 
it may be due to a leaking pipe fitting or a leak at the cold-water shut-off 
valve. If all the fittings are in good shape, and the valve is the culprit, try to 
stop the leak by using a wrench to tighten the packing nut.
The controller: The brains of the operation
The controller is the device you use to light the pilot and turn the unit off and 
on. It’s also used to adjust the temperature setting. The controller is usually 
pretty reliable and doesn’t require much maintenance other than an occa-
sional dusting. However, if you have too little hot water, water that is not hot 

142
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
enough, or water that is excessively hot, it may be time to replace the con-
troller. This is a job best left to a pro.
Securing your water heater to a wall
A water heater thrown over during an earthquake or other disaster can cause 
both broken gas lines and broken water lines. You can prevent such a sce-
nario if you strap the water heater securely to an adjacent wall.
Metal straps around the belly of the heater can be screwed to the housing 
and then anchored to wall framing. You can also install a special anchor that 
attaches to the water pipes at the top and to wall framing. In either case, your 
best bet is to check with your local building department for recommenda-
tions and a diagram on how best to anchor your water heater.
If you have a gas water heater
The burner, thermocouple, and venting system are components that are fun-
damental to the safe and efficient operation of a gas water heater. Keeping 
them clean and in good working order will keep you safe and help manage 
utility costs.
The burner: Just an old flame
On a gas water heater, the burner assembly is located at the bottom of the 
unit below the tank (refer to Figure 7-4). When the water temperature in the 
tank drops below the desired temperature, a thermostat activates the burner. 
The same process occurs with an electric water heater, but instead of a 
burner, electric heating elements are activated.
Periodically inspect the burner to make sure that it’s burning safely and 
efficiently. A dirty burner chamber can cause a fire and can make the burner 
less efficient. (If your burner is operating at peak efficiency, you’ll see a blue 
flame. If the flame is orange, adjust the shutter until it turns blue.)
To clean the burner, first turn off the gas shut-off valve (located on the gas 
supply to the water heater), remove the access panel, and vacuum the burner 
and chamber. Use a stiff wire and a wire brush to clear clogged burner ports 
and removes rust. If you aren’t successful in getting a blue flame, call in a ser-
vice rep from your utility company or a plumber or heating specialist.
The thermocouple
If you have a gas water heater with a pilot light that won’t stay lit, it’s prob-
ably due to one of two things:

143
 Chapter 7: Plumbing, Part I: Pipes, Water Heaters, Water Softeners, and More
 
✓ There is a blockage in the tiny tube that supplies gas to the pilot. If the 
tube is blocked, you can clear it by inserting a thin piece of wire or blow-
ing air through it.
 
 Make sure that the gas controller is in the off position before attempting 
this repair.
 
✓ The thermocouple has failed. The thermocouple is a thermoelectric 
device that shuts off the gas if the pilot light goes out. In simple terms, 
it’s a short piece of tubing that runs from the gas controller to the pilot. 
The pilot end of the thermocouple and the pilot are held side by side in 
a bracket that’s anchored to the burner. If your pilot light won’t stay lit, 
the thermocouple probably needs to be replaced. A new one costs about 
$5 to $10 and is easy to install.
If the thermocouple has failed, follow these steps:
 
1. Turn off the gas supply.
 
2. Remove the whole burner and thermocouple assembly.
 
 Unfasten the three nuts that hold the thermocouple and the two gas 
tubes to the valve. The burner typically sits loosely — or under clips — 
in the burning chamber and just slides out.
 
3. Detach the thermocouple from the burner.
 
 The thermocouple is usually attached to the pilot gas supply tube with 
one or more clips that snap into place. The end of the thermocouple is 
inserted into the pilot assembly and can simply be pulled out.
 
4. Take the detached thermocouple with you to the home center or hard-
ware store and buy a new one.
 
5. Install the new one the same way that you removed the old one.
 
 Attach the end of the new thermocouple into the pilot assembly and 
reattach the thermocouple to the pilot gas supply using the clips pre-
viously removed, reinstall the burner and, using a small open-end or 
adjustable wrench, reconnect the thermocouple lead, the gas tube to the 
main burner, and the pilot gas tube to the valve.
 
6. Turn the gas back on and follow the lighting instructions on the water 
heater.
 
7. Check for gas leaks by applying soapy water to joints and looking for 
bubbles while the main burner is firing.
The venting system
The venting system of a gas water heater consists of a flue that runs up the 
center of the water heater from the burners, out the top of the water heater, 

144
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
and through the rooftop to vent deadly gases created by combustion. At 
least twice each year, inspect the venting system to ensure that it’s properly 
aligned at the top of the water heater and that the connections are secure.
 
Here’s a quick test you can use to see if your gas water heater is venting 
properly: With the water heater running, hold a match near the draft diverter 
(the opening at the top of the water heater where the vent pipe connects to 
the unit). If the flame on the match leans in toward the vent pipe, your draft 
is good.
 
If the flame leans back toward the room, or worse yet, if it blows out the flame, 
your unit may be back-drafting, a potentially dangerous situation. If this hap-
pens, immediately turn off the unit and call the gas company for assistance. 
Chances are, your vent pipe or chimney is blocked somewhere, and your 
house may be filling with deadly combustion gases.
If you have an electric water heater
Electric water heaters have no burners to clean, no thermocouples to 
replace, and no venting systems to be concerned with. However, an electric 
water heater is not without its own set of maintenance tasks.
Cleaning your water heater’s electric elements
An electric water heater contains one or two heating elements similar to what 
you might find in your oven, except that they’re short and narrow. These 
electric elements can become laden with lime and mineral deposits that 
reduce their effectiveness or cause them to overheat and short out.
To clean your electric elements, follow these steps:
 
1. Turn off the power to the water heater.
 
2. Drain the tank by turning off the cold-water valve at the top of the 
water heater, attaching a garden hose to the drain valve at the base of 
the water heater, and opening the drain valve.
 
 To facilitate draining, open a hot-water faucet somewhere in the home.
 
3. After the water heater empties, use a screwdriver to remove the 
access panels to the elements.
 
 Depending upon the number of elements, one or more access panels 
will have to be removed. You may need to move a piece of insulation to 
expose the element.

145
 Chapter 7: Plumbing, Part I: Pipes, Water Heaters, Water Softeners, and More
 
4. Using your screwdriver, remove the elements and any electrical wires 
that power them.
 
 Elements are generally attached with a series of bolts, or they have a 
threaded base that screws directly into the tank.
 
5. Clean or replace the element.
 
 To clean the removed element, use a solution of vinegar and water or 
sodium carbonate and water (2 tablespoons of vinegar or 2 tablespoons 
of sodium carbonate in 1 quart of hot water) and a scouring pad.
 
 If an element has begun to corrode, replace it with a new one. Many dif-
ferent element types and styles are widely available; simply take the old 
one to the hardware store and find a match. Cooler-than-normal water, 
sporadic hot water, and a short supply of hot water are all telltale signs 
of a corroded element.
 
6. Reconnect the wires and refill the water heater.
 
 To refill the water heater, close the drain valve and turn the cold-water 
supply valve on, making sure that the hot-water faucet farthest from the 
water heater is left open to express all the air from the system.
 
7. Check for leaks around the elements.
 
8. After you’re sure that there are no leaks, replace the insulation and 
access panels and turn on the power.
 
Hard water and an electric water heater are a disastrous combination. You will 
forever be cleaning and replacing electric elements. We suggest that you con-
sider installing a water softener if you have an electric water heater.
Fixing a defective thermostat or tripped limit switch
If you still have a problem getting hot water out of your electric heater, it may 
be due to a defective thermostat or a tripped or defective high-temperature 
limit switch. The limit switch cuts off power to the element when the water 
temperature exceeds a certain limit — usually 190 degrees. You can reset a 
tripped high-temperature limit switch with the push of a button behind the 
access panel.
If the switch continues to trip, it may be due to either a defective limit switch 
or element. In either case, one or both need to be replaced. To replace a ther-
mostat, follow these steps:
 
1. Turn off the water and power to the water heater and remove the 
access panel and insulation.

146
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
 
2. Use a screwdriver to remove the wires from the thermostat.
 
3. Loosen the bracket bolts that hold the thermostat in place and slide 
the thermostat out.
 
4. Slide the new thermostat into place, tighten down the bolts, reconnect 
the wires, and press the Reset button.
 
5. Reinstall the insulation and access panel; then turn on the water and 
power.
Caring for your tankless water heater
Tankless water heaters are the newest kids on the water heating block. 
Beyond the fact that they’re more energy efficient, they don’t have the 
cleaning and maintenance woes associated with traditional tank-style units. 
However, a few tasks will ensure that your tankless water heater has a long, 
prosperous, and energy-efficient life:
 
✓ Keep control compartments, burners, and circulating air passageways 
of the appliance clean. First, turn off and disconnect electrical power 
and allow the unit to cool. Then remove and clean the water inlet filter. 
Using pressurized air, clean dust from the main burner, heat exchanger, 
and fan blades. Finish by using a soft, dry cloth to wipe the cabinet.
 
✓ Inspect the vent system for blockages or damage at least once a year.
 
✓ Flush the heat exchanger to get rid of lime and scale build up. Consult 
the owner’s manual for specific instructions on how to flush the heat 
exchanger.
 
✓ Visually inspect the flame. The burner must flame evenly over the 
entire surface when operating correctly. The burner must burn with a 
clear, blue, stable flame. Consult a pro to clean and adjust the burner for 
an irregular flame.
Softening Your Water
With the exception of adding salt to the brine tank on a regular basis, a water-
softening system is reasonably maintenance-free. Every now and then, the 
brine solution becomes clogged at the base of the brine tank, which prevents 
the solution from being siphoned into the resin tank. You know that this is 
the case if your brine tank is full of salt, yet your water doesn’t have that 
“slick” feel of softened water.

147
 Chapter 7: Plumbing, Part I: Pipes, Water Heaters, Water Softeners, and More
You can correct this problem by removing all the salt from the brine tank and 
flushing the bottom of the tank with a garden hose and water. Before replac-
ing the salt in the brine tank, manually cycle the unit to ensure that it’s oper-
ating properly. Individual units will have either a lever or a button that, when 
pressed, manually cycles the system. Check your owner’s manual to deter-
mine where the manual cycle button is on your water softener.
Wishing Your Well Is Working Well
If you don’t get your water from a municipal water source, it probably comes 
from a private well. Water is pumped from the source with a submersible 
pump that’s usually about 10 feet from the bottom of the well to a pressure 
tank in or near the house. The tank, in turn, feeds the water-supply lines. In a 
standard pressure tank, incoming water forces air into the upper third of the 
tank, where it forms a spring-like cushion. When the air pressure reaches a 
preset level — usually between 50 and 60 psi — the spring action of the com-
pressed air triggers a pressure switch, which shuts off the pump. As water is 
drawn from the tank, pressure diminishes. When it reaches a preset level — 
30 to 40 psi — the switch turns the pump on again.
When the pressure tank loses too much air pressure, it can become “water-
logged,” which causes the pump to switch on and off frequently. You can 
solve this problem by doing the following:
 
1. Turn off the power to the pump; then attach a garden hose to the 
drain valve at the bottom of the tank and open the valve and leave it 
open until there’s no more pressure in the tank.
 
2. Open a faucet in the house to drain all the water out of the tank.
 
3. When the tank is empty, turn off the faucet, close the drain valve on 
the tank, remove the hose, and turn the pump back on.
A leaking tank is another prevalent problem. If a leak develops, it usually 
appears first as an oozing rusty blemish. Although tank plugs are available, 
they’re only a temporary measure. The tank should be replaced as soon as 
possible.
Occasionally, the pump may stop working. If this is the case, first check 
for a blown fuse or tripped breaker. A loose wire may also be the source of 
the problem. If all these check out, your best bet is to call in a well service 
technician.

Maintaining Fixture Surfaces: Stainless 
Steel, Cast Iron, Fiberglass, and More
A home dweller eventually becomes intimately familiar with the various 
plumbing fixtures in a home — the sinks, tubs, toilets, and shower pans. It’s 
no fun when these fixtures become tattered. In many situations, cleaning is all 
it takes to make a worn-out fixture look brand-spanking-new!
Stainless-steel fixtures
Vitreous china and porcelain fixtures are great, but when it comes to sinks, 
one made of high-quality stainless steel wins hands down. Stainless steel 
sinks are light and easy to install, they don’t chip, and they’re easy to keep 
clean.

150
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
To clean a stainless steel surface, use one of the following:
 
✓ One drop of liquid dish soap in 1 quart of hot water
 
✓ Baking soda mixed with water until it forms a paste
 
✓ One part vinegar to one part water
Clean and then dry with a soft cloth. For tougher cleaning tasks, look for 
a commercial, stainless-steel cleaning product that contains oxalic acid. 
Regardless of the cleaner, a nylon scrubbing pad will help.
 
When caring for stainless steel, follow these two simple rules:
 
✓ Never use steel wool. Steel-wool fibers can lodge in the surface of the 
stainless steel and eventually rust, giving the appearance that the stain-
less steel is rusting. What a mess!
 
✓ Don’t use abrasive cleaners. They can scratch the surface over time.
 
If you really want to make your stainless-steel sink — and anything stainless 
steel (appliances, barbecue, and so on) — look like new, consider investing 
in a stainless-steel refinishing kit. Kits retail for about $50; can be found at 
appliance retailers, hardware stores, and home centers; last for years; and can 
make a tired, old, stainless-steel sink look like new.
Porcelain-on-steel and porcelain-
on-cast-iron fixtures
Porcelain on steel and porcelain on cast iron are both used primarily for 
kitchen sinks, laundry sinks, and bathtubs. Although cast iron is a stronger 
base, making porcelain fixtures generally more durable, porcelain does chip, 
and the finish is every bit as easy to scratch as vitreous china.
When porcelain is new, its surface gleams and glistens, but over time, it can 
lose its luster, especially if you use abrasives for cleaning. Plus, if you drop 
a heavy object onto a porcelain fixture, you may not shatter it, but you may 
chip the enamel. Fortunately, some companies do specialize in making such 
repairs. Look in the Yellow Pages under “plumbing fixture refinishing.” Here’s 
what the pros can do:
 
✓ Repair chips. A chip can be professionally repaired for about $75 to 
$125. Chip touch-up kits are available at your local home center or hard-
ware store, but we think they’re useless — they don’t last, and the fin-
ished result usually looks terrible.

151
 Chapter 8: Plumbing, Part II: Fixtures
 
✓ Reglaze. Porcelain and ceramic sinks, tubs, and other bathroom fixtures 
that are badly scratched, are chipped, and have lost their luster can be 
reglazed (refinished) by a professional porcelain refinisher. The fixture 
must be removed and sent to the reglazing house where a porcelain 
finish is applied. It’s then returned and reinstalled — hopefully without 
chipping it in the process.
 
 Reglazing is very expensive. In fact, reglazing a porcelain fixture isn’t 
worth the cost or effort unless it’s a valuable antique or a family heir-
loom, because replacing the fixture is far less expensive.
 
✓ Refinish. Refinishing — a paint-like coating — is a far less expensive 
alternative to reglazing and can produce finishes with varying degrees of 
durability. The least durable refinishing method involves paints or epox-
ies similar to what you can buy in a home-improvement store. The best 
materials are the industrial systems designed specifically for porcelain 
refinishing. Plan to spend $250 to $750 for a professionally refinished 
tub, depending upon the size, color, and condition. Refinishing typically 
takes as many as two days. Make sure to ask the refinisher how long 
your sink, faucet, or tub will be out of commission.
 
 As you investigate refinishing companies, look for a reputable one with 
references. Also ask about the warranty: Anything less than a five-year 
guarantee makes this process a bad bet. Some companies offer longer 
guarantees.
Fiberglass fixtures
Fiberglass fixtures are popular because they’re competitively priced. 
Fiberglass has been around for a long time and is used most commonly in 
tubs and shower pans. Fiberglass fixtures aren’t as durable as other types of 
fixtures and must be treated with care. However, given such care, they’ll last 
as long as any other.
A stained fiberglass tub or shower pan is a breeze to clean. Simply wet the 
entire surface to be cleaned with water, sprinkle on a thin layer of automatic 
dishwashing powder, and let it sit for about an hour. Keep the surface wet by 
spraying it with clear water. After an hour, use a nylon bristle brush to scrub 
away stains. Finish up by rinsing the entire area with fresh water.
 
For severely stained tub or shower floors, plug the drain and fill the tub or 
shower pan with about an inch of water. Sprinkle the automatic dishwashing 
powder over the entire surface and allow it to sit overnight. Use the nylon 
brush to scrub away stains and thoroughly rinse with fresh water. You’ll be 
amazed by its like-new appearance!

152
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
Composite fixtures
Although fiberglass is a resin painted onto a backing, composite fixtures are 
great thick hulks of plastic also known as solid surface material. What you 
see on the surface goes all the way through to the other side of the fixture. 
Composite fixtures are long lasting and far more durable than fiberglass. 
However, they aren’t as damage resistant as stainless steel.
Ordinary spills on composite require only a damp cloth for cleanup. You can 
eliminate tougher stains with a paste made of turpentine and salt: Mix 2 or 3 
tablespoons of turpentine into 1/4 cup of regular table salt, use a nylon bristle 
brush to apply the cleaner and scrub away the stains, and wipe up the excess 
with a paper towel. (Let the towel air-dry before disposal.) Then finish up by 
using a mild detergent and water followed by a freshwater rinse.
If a composite sink ever becomes really grungy, try filling the sink with a solu-
tion of bleach and water. The bleach works very well and will bring back the 
sink’s original color.
Most composite fixture manufacturers have product cleaning, repair, and 
maintenance kits or recommend specific cleaning products. Check with the 
manufacturer or contact the dealer who installed the fixture.
 
Because the finished look of a composite fixture goes all the way through, light 
sanding can remove burns, stains, or minor scratches. Polish the sanded area 
with fine 400- to 600-grit wet-dry sandpaper lubricated with turpentine to restore 
the surface to its original beauty. Wipe up the excess turpentine with a paper 
towel and finish the job by cleaning with a mild detergent and a freshwater rinse.
Vitreous china fixtures
Vitreous china — a smooth form of baked clay with a shiny or glassy look — is 
used primarily for bathroom sinks, toilets, and bidets. Although it’s strong, it 
can be chipped or broken if hit with a hard object, such as a tool. The bottom 
line: Be careful around vitreous china, especially during repairs and maintenance.
China is easily scratched, so for most cleaning, leave your scouring powder 
and abrasive pads in the cupboard. Note: A variety of commercial products 
claim to clean china without causing damage, but proceed with caution. Abrasive 
cleaners slowly wear down china’s brilliant surface, although the process can 
take years. Make sure that the cleaner you select states that it is nonabrasive.
 
For lime deposits, try a pumice stick — like the one our mom used on her feet 
to remove calluses — dipped in turpentine. Pumice is an extremely fine abra-
sive used for polishing. It comes in four grades with 4/0 being the finest. Don’t 
use hand cleaners; the grade of pumice used in them is too coarse.

153
 Chapter 8: Plumbing, Part II: Fixtures
Remove tea or coffee stains with a solution of 2 tablespoons chlorine bleach 
per 1 quart of water. Soak for just a minute or two; then rinse promptly.
 
Never mix bleach with a solution containing ammonia. The combination can 
release a poisonous gas.
Cleaning Your Faucet Works
When a faucet becomes dull, it makes an otherwise bright and shiny decorat-
ing accessory look tattered and worn. It isn’t worn out — it’s just dirty. The 
bad news is that dirt that has built up for a long period of time can be dif-
ficult to remove. The good news is that you can remove it without damaging 
the faucet if you know a few tricks.
Shopping for recycled or vintage fixtures
When it’s time to replace fixtures, either 
because you’re ready for a change or because 
the old ones are beyond repair, before you run 
out to buy new, think about buying used. Using 
recycled fixtures can have several benefits: 
Beyond achieving the desired look (usually 
something vintage or retro), recycled fixtures 
are usually less expensive than new ones. Plus, 
using recycled fixtures is very “green” and envi-
ronmentally friendly — it reduces what goes 
into landfills and, in the big picture, saves on the 
manufacture and shipping of new products.
Salvage and recycling centers sell used and 
surplus building materials at a fraction of 
normal prices. Although plumbing fixtures are 
among the most popular product categories, 
doors, windows, lumber, siding, trim, roofing, 
finish hardware, cabinetry, counters, flooring, 
lighting, radiators, and just about anything you 
can think of can be had.
An entire network of salvage and recycling cen-
ters and retail outlets has sprung up across the 
land. An excellent resource for recycled fixtures is 
the Building Materials Reuse Association (www.
bmra.org), which has several hundred affili-
ate members throughout the United States.
Keep in mind that many vintage fixtures — par-
ticularly toilets and faucets — don’t meet cur-
rent water conservation codes and, thus, can’t 
be used. Fortunately, there is no shortage of 
brand-spanking-new replica vintage plumbing 
fixtures and accessories that look just like the 
real McCoy. The difference is that these prod-
ucts are new and comply with current water 
conservation codes. Plus, their valve con-
struction is more reliable, and the finishes are 
more durable. Check out Historic Houseparts

Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
Cleaning a faucet is a two-part operation:
 
✓ Cleaning the aerator
 
✓ Cleaning and polishing the exterior finish
Cleaning the aerator
The aerator, a thimble-size accessory consisting of a very small disk filled 
with tiny holes, screws into the end of a faucet spout. It mixes the water with 
air and controls the amount of flow. When the aerator is operating normally, 
the water comes out of the spout in a smooth, gentle, even flow. If the water 
flow from your faucet is slow, if the water sprays out in random streams, or if 
a once-smooth flow has become sporadic and now sputters, then you prob-
ably have a clogged aerator.
Cleaning the aerator is really easy. Here’s all you have to do:
 
1. Unscrew the aerator from the spout by turning it counterclockwise.
 
2. Disassemble the aerator parts.
 
 The parts simply sit one atop another inside the aerator housing.
 
 As you disassemble the aerator, note exactly how the parts are assem-
bled. If you make a mistake during reassembly, the aerator won’t work.
 
3. Use an old toothbrush and a toothpick and some vinegar to clean 
each part.
 
 If you can’t remove lime-deposit buildup easily, soak the parts in straight 
vinegar overnight. Then scrub them clean.
 
4. Reassemble and reinstall the aerator.
 
 Be sure to align the threads correctly to avoid stripping them, which 
could cause a nasty spray leak every time you turn on the faucet.
Cleaning and polishing 
the outside of a faucet
To keep a faucet clean, regularly wipe it down with a damp cloth followed by 
a clean, dry towel. Built-up debris is a bit more difficult — especially when 
it’s a thick layer of lime deposits. Several different cleaners are available that 
remove hard-water stains and other mineral-deposit buildup:

155
 Chapter 8: Plumbing, Part II: Fixtures
 
✓ Pure sodium carbonate: Pure sodium carbonate (also known as washing 
soda or soda ash) is nothing more than laundry detergent. No fillers, no 
anti-bubbling agents, no odor eaters, nothing except pure cleaning power. 
It’s available at swimming-pool supply stores. To use pure sodium carbon-
ate, mix 1/2 cup sodium carbonate with a few drops of warm water. Then, 
using a soft clean cloth, rub the paste onto the faucet surface, and keep 
rubbing until it shines. To finish, rinse with fresh water and towel-dry.
 
✓ White vinegar and baking soda: To use this foamy cleaner, mix equal 
parts of baking soda and white vinegar, wipe the concoction onto the 
surface of the faucet with a clean, soft cloth and rub until the surface is 
clean and shiny. Then rinse with clear water and towel-dry.
 
✓ Calgon: Calgon is a common household product that acts as a really neat 
faucet-cleaning agent. To clean your faucets with Calgon, mix 1 teaspoon 
of Calgon into 1 gallon of hot water. Soak a rag in the concoction and very 
gently wring it out; then place the soaked rag onto the faucet, pressing 
the rag against all parts of the faucet, and cover it with plastic wrap (the 
kind you use with leftovers in the kitchen) so that it doesn’t dry out. Come 
back in one hour, remove the rag, and use it to briskly wipe away the min-
eral buildup. Finally, rinse the Calgon away with fresh water and pat dry 
with a soft clean cloth. Note: For long-time buildup, you may have to soak 
the rag in the solution and place it back onto the faucet several times.
 
✓ Plain vinegar: Plain vinegar is great for removing a major mineral-salt 
buildup. You use it the same way you use the Calgon solution: With a vinegar-
soaked rag, wipe down all the faucet areas; leave the rag on the faucet for an 
hour covered with plastic wrap; then wipe it down again, rinse, and towel-dry.
 
Don’t use abrasive cleaners on a faucet. Liquid cleaners work best without 
damaging the finish. Be sure to test a cleaner on an out-of-the-way spot to 
ensure that it doesn’t remove or damage the paint.
Removing copper residue
If your plumbing pipes are made of copper, or if the faucet entrails are made 
of copper, chances are that a dark green cast will appear at the faucet spout. 
The patina color indicates oxidation of copper. If left unattended, this condi-
tion will destroy the finish on a polished brass faucet in no time.
If you see green at the tip of your faucet, reach for a metal cleaner such as 
Brasso or Flitz. Both products are used in the same way: Pour a small amount 
of the cleaner on a soft, dry cloth and rub the cleaner onto the corroded area 
and keep rubbing until the ultra fine polishing compound eats away at the 
bad finish. Let the remaining compound form a white haze and use another

Toilet Training 101
What follows is a bit of toiletology that we hope will bring you and your 
family even closer to your bathroom and, specifically, your toilet.
 
When you clean or repair your toilet, you often need to empty the water out 
of the tank (the reservoir that holds the water that enters the bowl when the 
toilet is flushed) and/or the bowl. Here’s how to perform these very basic 
tasks:
 
✓ To empty the tank: Turn off the water to the tank (at the shut-off valve) 
and flush the toilet. With the wall valve off, the tank will not refill. (The 
shut-off valve is the knob located below and behind the toilet.)
 
✓ To empty the bowl: Turn off the water to the tank (see the preceding 
bullet) and then fill a large container with 1 gallon of water and pour the 
water into the toilet bowl. You can remove any water that remains with a 
small cup and/or a sponge.
Until you turn the water on and flush the toilet, the bowl and tank will remain 
empty.
 
Some of the problems associated with toilets also apply to bidets, including 
slow water flow and mineral deposits. Obviously, a bidet doesn’t have a tank, 
but the bowls are similar, so if the problem fits, so does the solution.
Cleaning the toilet
Toilets that aren’t cleaned regularly can become a mess, and toilet-bowl 
cleaners don’t always do the job. The strong ones can be dangerous to work 
with, and the others aren’t always strong enough to get things really clean.
Because bacteria love to live in toilets, pour 1 cup of bleach into the tank and 
mix it into the water. Let it set for a few minutes; then flush the toilet a few 
times. You’ve just sanitized your toilet.
 
Bleach is great for killing bacteria, but it can also kill your flapper. Some toilet 
bowl cleaners that are designed to be placed in your toilet tank and give the 
water in your bowl that ocean blue color contain chlorine, which, with pro-
longed exposure, can prematurely deteriorate the rubber flush valve (also 
called a flapper) and result in a leaking toilet. That’s why we recommend the 
occasional shot of chlorine bleach followed by a full flush.

157
 Chapter 8: Plumbing, Part II: Fixtures
Cleaning the siphon jets
The siphon jets are the small openings under the rim of the bowl that help 
rinse the bowl and assist with the flush. If these jets become clogged, your 
toilet won’t flush properly. If, when you flush the toilet, the water comes straight 
down rather than swirls, the holes are probably plugged. Discolored vertical 
lines in the bowl are another telltale sign that the holes need cleaning.
Inspect the rim openings with a pocket mirror. It they’re clogged with mineral 
deposits, first empty the tank and the bowl and then use a hanger as a “pipe 
cleaner” to ream out the holes at the rim (see Figure 8-1). If the scale that 
exists is too hard to remove, try this trick to soften things up:
 
1. Use a towel to completely dry the underside of the rim.
 
2. Apply a layer of duct tape to the underside of the rim to seal all of the 
holes.
 
 If it doesn’t stick, the rim is wet.
 
3. Fill the tank with 1 gallon of pure vinegar (any kind).
 
4. Flush the toilet.
 
 The vinegar travels from the tank into the rim of the toilet. Let it sit 
there for as long as possible — 24 hours is ideal.
 
5. Remove the tape, scrub away the softened scale, turn the water back 
on, and flush the toilet.
 
 This solution should work beautifully.

Removing a ring around the bowl
If a white or brown ring forms in the bowl, place a couple of denture tablets 
in the bowl. The tablets will effervesce in the water and dissolve. Let the mix-
ture set over night. (We recommend a separate container for your dentures.) 
The next morning, just flush the toilet and wipe away the softened buildup.
 
If some of the stains remain, empty the bowl; then dip a pumice stick (which 
looks like a large, dark gray piece of chalk) into some turpentine and scrub. 
(For lighter buildup, use a nylon scrubbing pad in place of the pumice stick.) 
Turpentine is a great cleaning agent, and the pumice is a super-fine abrasive. 
Together they make cleaning a breeze.
 
Pumice is abrasive — don’t use a pumice stick on chrome or painted finishes.
Unclogging plugged toilets
A clogged toilet is always an accident. No one ever intends to cause the dis-
gusting mess associated with a toilet backup. If you do experience a blockage, 
try clearing the obstruction with a plumber’s helper (a plunger). If that doesn’t 
work, cut a coat hanger and bend a hook in one end. Force the coat hanger into 
the neck of the toilet and try to hook the blockage. If you’re still not successful, 
it’s time to use a closet auger, also called a closet snake (see Figure 8-2).
 
Figure 8-2:

Toilet

159
 Chapter 8: Plumbing, Part II: Fixtures
To use a closet snake, follow these steps:
 
1. Pull the handle of the closet auger all the way out of the hollow tube 
so that the hooked end is up against the end of the tube and none of 
the cable is released.
 
2. Insert the auger end of the snake into the throat of the toilet.
 
 Make sure that the vinyl sleeve is up against the porcelain to prevent 
damage.
 
3. Turn the crank slowly while, at the same time, pushing the rod and 
snake into the toilet trap and down into the sewer line; continue to 
turn the crank when retracting the snake.
If the snake doesn’t work (or you aren’t interested in getting this up close and 
personal with your toilet), call the plumber.
Preventing a sweaty tank
A toilet tank sweats when the cold water inside chills the tank in a warm 
bathroom. The sweat is actually condensation. The condensation can 
become so profuse that it can result in puddles on the floor that can damage 
floor covering, trim, and other finishes. One way to reduce sweating is to 
make sure that the water entering the tank isn’t cold, by having a plumber 
add a mixing valve at the tank inlet to introduce warm water into the tank. 
Unfortunately, this fix is relatively expensive.
 
A less expensive solution is one you can do yourself: Just fit sheets of polysty-
rene or foam rubber against the inside of the tank walls. You can either use a 
toilet tank liner (available at hardware stores, home centers, or plumbing-sup-
ply wholesalers), or you can cut the foam to fit the bottom of the tank and the 
walls. Glue the foam or liner in place with silicone cement and let the adhesive 
dry for at least 24 hours before filling the tank (see Figure 8-3).
 
Decorative (typically shag-style) cloth tank covers are supposed to insulate 
the tank and reduce the chance for condensation. However, if the temperature 
difference is great enough, a certain amount of condensation will still occur, 
which can be a problem. If the cloth cover gets wet, mold and mildew can 
result. Yuck! We never did like those cloth covers anyway.
Looking for leaks in and around the toilet
Some leaks occur outside the toilet. If the floor is wet around the toilet, you 
obviously have a leak (or a sweating toilet, as explained in the preceding sec-
tion). The trick is finding where the leak is coming from (there are several 
places to look) so that you can take the proper steps to solve the problem.

160
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
 
Figure 8-3: 
Lining the

The shut-off valve at the wall
Use a towel to dry the floor around the toilet; then lay a piece of toilet paper 
on the floor beneath the valve and wait for about 15 minutes. If the toilet 
paper is wet, the shut-off valve (or the supply tube connected to it) leaks. 
Try tightening the valve fittings. If that doesn’t work, you need to replace the 
valve and/or supply line.
If the shut-off valve is leaking, replace it using the following steps:
 
1. Turn off the main water supply to the house and open an exterior 
water faucet at the lowest point of the home.
 
2. Flush the toilet to remove all the water from the toilet tank. Remove 
any remaining water with a sponge.
 
3. Use adjustable pliers to loosen the nut that attaches the water-supply 
line to the shut-off valve.
 
4. Use an adjustable wrench to grasp the shut-off valve’s hex-shaped body 
and carefully turn it counterclockwise to remove it from the nipple 
(the short piece of threaded pipe) that is stubbed out of the wall.
 
5. Wrap Teflon tape around the threads on the nipple, place the new 
shut-off value onto the nipple, and gently turn it clockwise to thread 
the shut-off valve onto the nipple. Use the adjustable wrench to snug 
the valve into place.
 
 If the nipple is copper, call a plumber to replace the leaking shut-off valve. 
These can be very tricky to replace because of the compression ring used 
instead of the threaded connection you find on galvanized pipe.

161
 Chapter 8: Plumbing, Part II: Fixtures
 
6. Reattach the supply line, being sure to first use Teflon tape on threads 
on the shut-off valve to prevent a leak.
 
7. Turn on the main water valve and the toilet shut-off valve and use 
the toilet paper investigation technique mentioned earlier to check 
for leaks.
Where the supply tube connects
Use a small clump of toilet paper to wipe the bottom of the tank where the 
supply tube (the thin, flexible tube that carries water from the shut-off valve 
to the toilet tank) connects. If it’s wet, the leak is there. Tighten the nut and 
the supply line at that location. If that doesn’t work, replace the supply line.
 
When choosing a new supply line, get a braided stainless steel one instead 
of the copper or vinyl hoses, which are not as durable and can burst under 
excessively high pressure or exceedingly cold temperatures. A few extra 
dollars can prevent a flood that could save thousands of dollars and lots of 
heartache.
To replace the supply line, follow these steps:
 
1. Turn off the shut-off valve that supplies water to the toilet.
 
 Simply turn the little valve that is located below and behind the toilet 
clockwise until it stops.
 
2. Flush the toilet to remove all the water from the toilet tank. Remove 
any remaining water with a sponge.
 
3. Use adjustable pliers to loosen the nut that attaches the water supply 
line to the underside of the tank and the nut that attaches the supply 
line to the shut-off valve.
 
 The supply line is now free of the toilet and shut-off valve and can be 
replaced with a new one.
 
4. Install the new supply line, being careful not to over-tighten the nuts 
at either end.
 
 Use Teflon tape on the threads of the shut-off valve and the fitting at the 
underside of the toilet to prevent a leak.
 
5. Turn on the main water valve and the toilet shut-off valve and use the 
toilet paper investigation technique mentioned earlier to check for leaks.
The area where the tank connects to the bowl
Two bolts hold the tank to the bowl. If either of them leaks, try tightening the 
bolt slightly. Don’t over-tighten — you can crack the toilet. If tightening the 
bolts doesn’t stop the leak, replace the rubber gasket that is on either bolt 
within the tank: Empty the tank, remove the bolts, replace the gaskets, and 
reinstall the bolts.

162
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
The toilet’s exterior surface
Check the entire exterior surface of the toilet for hairline cracks. If you find 
any, the toilet needs to be replaced. Replacing a toilet may not be one of the 
most exciting ways to spend a Saturday, but then that’s the nice part about 
this particular project; you should be able to perform this little task and still 
have time to enjoy your afternoon.
Gather the following tools:
 
✓ An open-ended wrench (1/4 inch or 3/8 inch)
 
✓ An adjustable wrench
 
✓ A pair of adjustable pliers
 
✓ A flathead screwdriver
 
✓ A hacksaw
Then follow these steps to replace the toilet:
 
1. Turn off the shut-off valve to the toilet (see Figure 8-4).
 
 Turn the valve that is located below and behind the toilet clockwise 
until it stops.
 
2. Disconnect the water-supply line.
 
 Flush the toilet and remove any water that may remain in the tank 
or bowl with a small cup and a sponge. After all the water has been 
removed, disconnect the water-supply line at the base of the tank; use 
adjustable pliers to turn the nut in a counterclockwise direction.
 
3. Unfasten the toilet from the floor (see Figure 8-5).
 
 Most residential toilets are anchored to the floor with a couple of fasten-
ers called closet bolts, which are concealed by plastic caps. Pry the caps 
off by wedging a flathead screwdriver between the bottom lip of the cap 
and the porcelain. Remove the nuts that remain with an open-ended 
wrench turning counterclockwise.
 
4. Remove the toilet and as much of the wax ring as you can (see 
Figure 8-6).
 
 We suggest that you have one other person help you lift the toilet and 
carry it out because it’s as awkward as it is heavy.
 
 Grasp the toilet by the rim and the underside of the tank and lift directly 
upward. Don’t be alarmed by the gooey mess on the floor where the toilet 
once sat. It’s some of the wax ring, which forms a seal between the toilet and 
the toilet flange that’s connected to the sewer. Use a putty knife to remove 
the wax that remains; doing so improves the odds of a new leakproof seal.

5. Install the new toilet (see Figure 8-7).
 
 With the toilet lying on its side, install the new wax ring (sold sepa-
rately) by placing it wax side up against the underside of the toilet. The 
wax ring will be slightly larger than the hole at the base of the toilet. 
Install new closet bolts (typically provided with the toilet) in the slots on 
the closet flange in an upright position, just as you found the old ones. 
Next, with the help of a friend, stand the toilet up and, without allowing 
the bottom to touch the floor, align the holes in the base of the toilet 
with the closet bolts, and then gently lower the toilet until it completely 
seats.
 
6. Connect the closet bolts.
 
 Install the washers and nuts onto the closet bolts, being careful not to 
tighten them too tight, which could result in a broken toilet. Ugh! Then 
place the bolt caps over the nuts. If the bolt caps don’t properly seat, 
chances are that the bolts are too long. Shorten the bolts by cutting off 
the excess with a hacksaw.

7. Install the water-supply line (see Figure 8-8).
 
 See “The shut-off valve at the wall,” earlier in this chapter, for instruc-
tions on removing and reconnecting a supply line.
 
The easiest way to remember which direction tightens and which one loosens 
is the old axiom “righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.” Turning most threaded things right, 
or clockwise, tightens them (righty-tighty); turning them to the left, or coun-
terclockwise, loosens them (lefty-loosey). There are exceptions to this rule — 
for example, left-handed threads on things that are used to secure things that 
also turn clockwise (like the blade on a table saw). So, if you run into a nut 
that just won’t give, before muscling it any more, try switching direction.

Between the base of the toilet and the floor
If water is seeping out between the base of the toilet and the floor, then the 
wax ring has failed. Remove the toilet (see the preceding section), replace the 
wax ring, and reinstall the toilet.
 
Even if the floor is dry, if you have access to the area beneath the toilet (like in 
the basement or crawlspace.), occasionally check to see if the toilet has devel-
oped a hidden leak. Look for damp wood or evidence of dripping water. If you 
find this telltale evidence, replace the wax ring.
Maintaining Tubs and Showers
Most people make at least one trip a day to the tub or shower. We don’t know 
anyone who wants to perform a morning scrub-down in a mildew-lined fixture 
with a dangerously slippery floor. Our tub and shower tips show you how 

167
 Chapter 8: Plumbing, Part II: Fixtures
to easily maintain these fixtures so that your movie called Showering and 
Bathing will be a love story — not a horror flick.
Keeping your tubs and showers clean
How you clean your tub or shower depends on the material they’re made of:
 
✓ To clean a porcelain tub: Use the same methods described for cleaning 
vitreous surfaces (see the “Vitreous china fixtures” section, earlier 
in this chapter). You can also remove soap scum and dirt using auto-
matic dishwasher detergent and hot water. Rinse with fresh water and 
towel-dry.
 
✓ To clean fiberglass: Use a mixture of 1/4 cup of salt mixed with 2 to 3 
tablespoons of turpentine. Scrub the concoction onto the surface with 
a nylon bristle brush. Wipe up the excess with paper towels. Follow by 
washing with a mild detergent. Rinse with fresh water and towel-dry.
 
To minimize major cleaning chores, try these tips:
 
✓ Apply a coat of lemon oil or a coat of car polish (but not both) to your 
tub, shower walls, and shower door. These products reduce surface 
tension and cause water and soap residue to drain off instead of sticking 
to a surface.
 
✓ Squeegee wet surfaces or wipe them dry with a towel after each use. It 
only takes a moment.
Re-caulking
If you have tile shower walls, there is a very good possibility that a leak could 
develop between the tile and the tub. As the house moves (a natural process 
that occurs in every home), a hairline crack can occur that allows water to 
get into the joint. Once water gets in, there is no telling how much damage 
can be done. That’s why it’s important to annually caulk the connection 
between your shower walls and the tub or shower pan.
Here’s another good reason to re-caulk. If you’ve tried to remove the black 
mildew stains from caulk, you know it’s sometimes hopeless. That’s because 
the stains are often behind the caulk — between the caulk and the wall. The 
answer, of course, is to remove the caulk, kill the mildew, and then replace 
the caulk.

168
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
To remove old caulk
Removing what exists and then caulking from scratch are the way to go. 
Fortunately, removing the caulk isn’t as hard as it may seem.
 
Caulk-Be-Gone and Adhesive & Caulk Remover are two commercial products 
that can assist you in the job. These products are specially formulated to 
soften caulk for easy removal.
To remove caulk, simply apply a caulk remover and allow it to sit until the 
caulk has softened (it may take a few hours). Then remove the softened caulk 
with a plastic putty knife. Finish up by cleaning the joint with paint thinner 
and wiping the area dry with a clean rag.
To get rid of mildew
After you’ve removed the old caulk, you can get rid of mildew by cleaning the 
joint with our Easy Mildew Remover (see Chapter 20). Just spray the mixture 
onto the mildewed area. Let it sit until the black mildew turns white. Rinse 
with fresh water; then use a hair dryer to thoroughly dry the area. The joint 
can now be re-caulked.
 
Although our Easy Mildew Remover mixture is mild, don’t forget to wear 
gloves and eye protection and make sure the area is well ventilated.
 
Improve the odds of preventing mildew from returning by wiping down the 
joint with denatured alcohol just before applying the new caulk.
To apply new caulk
For a professional-looking job, follow these steps:
 
1. Apply blue painter’s masking tape to the tub 1/8 inch from the joint; 
then apply another strip of tape along the wall, 1/8 inch from the joint.
 
 Now the caulking will go between the two pieces of tape, making 
straight, smooth lines.
 
2. Apply tub and tile caulk into the joint and smooth it with your finger, 
an old teaspoon, or a caulking spreader.
 
3. Immediately remove the tape.
 
 Pull it out and away from the freshly caulked joint. Be careful not to 
touch the caulk.
 
4. Let the caulk dry.
 
 Caulk can take varying amounts of time to dry, depending upon the type 
being used and the temperature and humidity in your home. In general, 
your best bet is to allow the caulk to dry overnight before getting it wet.
You simply won’t believe how beautiful your job will look.

 Chapter 8: Plumbing, Part II: Fixtures
Avoiding overflow leaks
The tub overflow is the device located at the end of the tub just above the 
drain. It derives its name from the purpose it serves: preventing a tub from 
overflowing. Sometimes the overflow assembly holds the lever for a built-in 
drain stopper. (Sinks also have overflows — a hole beneath the front edge — 
but with sinks, the overflow is built in; no hardware is attached that can fail 
and leak.)
What you see when you look at a tub overflow is a decorative metal cover. 
Behind the cover and on the outside surface of the tub is a gasket. Behind 
the gasket is the pipe that directs overflow into the sewer system. The two 
screws located in the overflow plate hold together the decorative cover 
plate, the overflow gasket, and the overflow pipe. When the screws become 
loose, the gasket can leak.
To avoid leads, check the screws every year or two to ensure that they’re 
snug. If you overfill the tub and the gasket isn’t tight, it can leak behind the 
tub, causing problems that can be hard to detect.

S
anitation is one of the single most important systems in your home. A 
cracked window pane or a broken fence board can wait until you have 
time to make the necessary repair. However, when it comes to your sewer 
or septic system, time is of the essence. Think about it; what could be worse 
than a toilet that won’t flush, a sink that won’t drain, or an overflowing tub? 
Okay, a house fire is obviously more urgent, but beyond that you’ll be hard 
pressed to find a more time-sensitive maintenance emergency. So, kick up 
your feet and delve into this chapter before one of the kids calls out for help 
in the bathroom.
Sewer-System Basics
Every plumbing fixture in your home is joined by the same drainpipe — that 
means the kitchen sink, the dishwasher, the washing machine, the toilets, and 
so on. The waste from each of these fixtures exits the house through this one 
drainpipe. A problem caused by one fixture can easily become a problem for 
all the other fixtures.

172
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
Your common, everyday household sanitary sewer system consists of three 
basic elements (see Figure 9-1):
 
✓ The waste lines and drainpipe: The waste lines carry sewage from each 
of the fixtures in your home down through the walls and under the floor, 
and then outside the home to either a public sewer system beneath the 
street or a septic tank somewhere below ground on your property. A 
clog in any of these pipes stops waste from reaching its destination away 
from your home — and it can back up into your home.
 
✓ The vent pipes: Vent pipes travel from each plumbing fixture (or group 
of plumbing fixtures), upward (inside walls) and out through the roof. 
These pipes are the typically black ones that stick up out of your roof. 
The vents allow air into the sewer lines so that they drain freely. A 
clogged vent pipe can be a serious problem, preventing good drainage 
of waste.
 
✓ The p-traps: You have one of these traps in every fixture: sink, toilet, 
washing machine, you name it. If the fixture drains into the sewer 
system, the water or waste first travels through a p-trap. The trap allows 
water and waste to enter the sewer system while at the same time pre-
venting sewer gases from backing up into your home. A clogged p-trap 
can inhibit the flow of waste from the home and can allow stinky gases 
to back up into the home through the fixtures.

Keeping Your System Clog-Free
When we were just a couple of youngsters, one of our dad’s favorite sayings 
was “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” Dad was right — 
especially when it comes to the drain and sewer system. Trapping hair and 
soap scum in the tub or shower, using a lint filter at the clothes washer, and 
being careful about what you throw into the kitchen sink — including the 
garbage disposal — can prevent minor clogs that can cause major headaches 
and repairs. Take it from our dad and do everything you can to prevent a 
plumbing disaster. You can be a real hero and keep your home’s lower GI tract 
in tip-top shape by taking advantage of the following advice. Thanks, Dad!
Being careful what you 
put down the drain
One of the absolute best ways to prevent slow or clogged drains is to be care-
ful about what you put into them. Clever, eh?
 
Cooking grease, coffee grounds, hair, and soap scum are four of a drain’s big-
gest enemies. Do whatever you can to avoid introducing any of these items 
into a drain. Here’s how:
 
✓ Save cooking grease in an old coffee can or cardboard milk container. 
Then dispose of it in the trash.
 
✓ Throw coffee grounds away in the garbage or add them to your 
mulch pile.
 
✓ Use a screen or drain-grate to cover the drain’s opening and minimize 
problems with hair and soap scum. Stop by your local plumbing-supply 
store to study the choices appropriate for your particular fixture. Take 
along a picture of the drain system to better explain your needs. Most 
filters and screens can be simply laid in place.
Preventive pipe cleaning
 
Regular cleaning has its merits. To keep drains in your home running freely — 
and absent of odor — try these methods:
 
✓ Run hot water through the sink after each use. Hot water keeps oils 
in food products running down the drain, rather than building up on 
the interior surface of pipes, which can make drains sluggish and lead 
to clogs.

174
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
 
✓ Throw a handful of baking soda into the drain and follow it with hot 
water. Baking soda is a terrific cleaning agent, and it’s also great for 
absorbing foul odors and leaving your drain pipes smelling like a rose. 
Okay, maybe not like a rose, but a lot better than they otherwise would.
 
✓ Pour 1 cup of vinegar down the drain and let it sit for 30 minutes; 
then chase it down with very hot water. Vinegar is a wonder cleaner 
(as Chapter 20 explains). It contains acetic acid, which acts as an excel-
lent organic solvent in removing organic buildup of crud in pipes.
 
If clogging is a regular problem at your place, try this one out for size. It works 
on drains in sinks, showers, and tubs. You need 1/2 cup each of baking soda, 
salt, and vinegar and a couple quarts of boiling water. Just before going to bed 
(to allow the solution to sit overnight, giving it more cleaning horsepower), do 
the following:
 
1. Pour the salt and the baking soda into the drain.
 
2. Add the vinegar and let the concoction foam for about a minute.
 
3. Chase with at least 2 quarts of boiling water.
For additional tips on cleaning your sink, toilet, tub, and shower, turn to 
Chapter 8.
For sinks with garbage disposals, you can also try this trick:
 
1. Fill an ice-cube tray half-full with vinegar and top it off with clear 
water.
 
 Vinegar alone won’t freeze well. Be sure to mark the tray clearly — you 
wouldn’t want an unsuspecting family member to end up with a mouth-
ful of vinegar. Can you imagine how that martini would taste?
 
2. Turn the disposal on and then throw in the cubes.
 
 Vinegar is a mild acid that cleans the disposal and the drain while the 
ice literally chills and scrapes grease off its walls (see Figure 9-2).
 
 If you don’t like the smell of vinegar, you can chase the cubes with one 
sliced lemon. Your disposal and your kitchen will smell great!
A word about commercial drain cleaners
Lye is the active ingredient in most popular store-bought drain cleaners. It 
dissolves soap scum and hair in a heartbeat. All you have to do is pour some 
down the drain, chase with a small amount of water, and wait for the chemi-
cal to do its job.

175
 Chapter 9: Plumbing, Part III: Sewer and Septic Systems

Small amounts of lye are reasonably safe. But too much of a good thing could 
suddenly turn nasty. Strong drain cleaners aren’t safe when used in large quan-
tities. Make sure to follow the directions on the label to the letter.
Unclogging the Waste Lines
The clean-out system in your sewer provides access to the waste lines for 
easy cleaning, which can save you hundreds of dollars in plumber’s bills. A 
clean-out is a port with a removable cap that provides access to the inside of 
the sewer line.
So where are your clean-outs? The National Plumbing Code requires clean-
outs to be placed in your waste lines at least every 100 linear feet of horizon-
tal travel. Clean-outs must be even closer together when the total angle of all 
bends in the horizontal sections of line exceed 135 degrees.

176
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
 
The tell-tale sign of a clean-out is its cap. It’s a flat, threaded disk fitted with 
a hexagonal protrusion at its center, which allows it to be easily removed (or 
replaced) with a wrench or a pair of pliers.
Clean-outs can be found under sinks, sticking out of exterior walls, and ran-
domly in the area beneath the floor — but not buried below the soil. When 
you know where all your clean-outs are, you can use that knowledge to keep 
your sewer clean on your own. And you can give your plumber a rest — at 
home, not in Tahiti with your money!
To clear a clog through the clean-outs, follow these steps:
 
1. Using a wrench or pair of pliers, remove the clean-out cover.
 
2. Use a plumber’s auger, or “snake,” to clear a clog at the first sign of a 
drainage problem (see Figure 9-3).
 
 Most good do-it-yourselfers own a small version of a plumber’s auger. 
Not only is a small auger inexpensive, but it’s easy to store as well. (See 
Chapter 8 for information about snakes that are made especially for 
clearing toilet clogs.)

Keeping Vents Free from Debris
When a sink isn’t draining properly, and the waste line isn’t clogged, you may 
need to take a look upward to find the culprit — up toward the vent system. 
You know, the black plumbing pipes that stick up out of your roof. When 
a vent becomes clogged, it shows up within the home as everything from 
“ghost flushes” at the toilet to sinks that simply won’t drain properly.
One or more of the following can collect in a vent line and completely clog it. 
Here are a few things that we’ve found:
 
✓ Birds (usually deceased, but sometimes nesting)
 
✓ Rodent carcasses (once we found just the skeleton)
 
✓ Leaves, trash, and other rubbish, which are sometimes almost impos-
sible to remove
 
✓ Tennis balls and baseballs (we’re still waiting for our first water balloon)
Because clearing vent-pipe blockages can be a real pain in the you-know-
what, we suggest that you take the preventive steps. You won’t be sorry.
Getting rid of blockages
Unfortunately, the best place to clear a blockage in a vent pipe is from the roof.
 
Working up on the roof can be a dangerous task, to say the least. So, you may 
want to have this job done by someone who has experience working up high. If 
you feel confident about performing the work yourself, be sure that the roof is 
dry, wear rubber-soled shoes, and use a safety harness to prevent yourself from 
falling off the roof if you slip. (See Chapter 5 for more tips on working on the roof.)
Dealing with clogs
You’ll need a flashlight, a plumber’s snake, and a garden hose. Use the flashlight 
to shine a bright light down the vent pipe to look for leaves, nesting materials, 
or other debris you may be able to remove from above. Then try the following:
 
✓ Remove any items you can reach. For those items you can’t remove 
from above, run the plumber’s snake down the vent pipe.
 
✓ Feed the end of a garden hose down the vent pipe and have someone 
on the ground turn on the water. Listen carefully for water backing up 

178
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
and a sudden whoosh when the weight of the water forces the clog into 
and down the drain.
 
 You can also feed the hose down into the vent pipe as you would a 
plumber’s snake to dislodge a clog that’s not solid enough to dam water.
Dealing with frozen plumbing
Blockages caused by frozen plumbing vents can be a problem for homes 
located in extremely cold climates. The best way to clear a frozen vent is by 
pouring really hot water into the vent pipe. But climbing up a ladder with a 
bucket of hot water can be dangerous. A simpler way of doing this is to con-
nect a rubber hose — rated for use with hot water — to the hot-water spigot 
at your washing machine. Works every time!
Putting preventive measures in place
One of the most effective means of preventing plumbing-vent pipe block-
ages is with the use of vent pipe screens. These nifty devices fit snugly onto 
the top of vent pipes and prevent blockages from animals, bugs/insects, and 
debris such as leaves. You can find these screens at hardware stores, home 
centers, plumbing wholesalers, and online.
Is your ghost flush friendly?
About five years ago, we were on the air doing 
our radio show. A caller phoned in with a most 
unusual question. “My toilet flushes all by 
itself,” she said. She went on to explain that no 
one was near the toilet when it flushed. It did 
it all by itself. “Do I have ghosts,” she asked? 
Naturally, we decided to run with it. We excit-
edly told her that Casper the Friendly Ghost was 
on a toilet-flushing rampage and, well, you can 
probably figure out the rest.
After a few minutes of horsing around, we 
returned to serious diagnosing. The flush that 
our caller described was not a conventional 
one. The flush-lever never moved — not once. 
And water wasn’t released from the tank. Each 
time, the tank remained full and undisturbed. But 
the toilet was flushing. Every once in a while, 
the water in the bottom of the toilet bowl 
would simply be sucked right down the drain! 
Fllluuuusssshhh!
As we continued to diagnose, we found out that 
each time that the toilet had flushed, someone 
was taking a shower. We surmised that the 
shower and toilet were connected to the same 
vent pipe (often, two or more plumbing fixtures 
are connected to a single vent pipe) and that 
the vent had clogged.
When the shower drained, the water moving 
down the sewer line acted like a piston, 
causing suction. Apparently, air could not be 
drawn in from the clogged vent to offset the 
increasing negative pressure, so the next best 
place — the toilet — became the ventilation 
intake port. Casper had nothing to do with it.

179
 Chapter 9: Plumbing, Part III: Sewer and Septic Systems
Preventing a frozen vent can be a bit trickier. In general, the easiest way to 
prevent a vent pipe from freezing is by increasing the size of the vent by two 
to three times the diameter where the pipe travels vertically in the attic. The 
added volume of air makes freezing more difficult.
 
An alternative is to install a vent pipe that has a built-in heater, such as the 
ArticVent by Heat-Line (www.heatline.com). It’s a heat tape for your eaves, 
gutters, and pipes, except the heating element is built in to the vent pipe. You 
simply remove about 3 feet of the uppermost portion of vent pipe, install the 
ArticVent, and plug it into an electrical outlet in the attic. Not a bad alternative 
if you live in a really cold climate and frozen vents are a recurring problem.
Avoiding Problems with P-Traps
The p-trap is that strangely curved pipe that you see beneath any sink in 
your home. Actually, a p-trap can be found at every single plumbing fixture — 
whether you can see it or not. If you can’t see it, you can be sure it’s either 
inside the fixture (as it is with toilets), beneath the floor (in the case of show-
ers and tubs), or inside the wall (for washing-machine drains).
The name of this special piece of drain comes from the letter of the alpha-
bet that it resembles, and also from the fact that it actually traps water. 
Essentially, the trap holds enough water in its curved base to act as a “water 
door,” preventing unpleasant waste and sewer gases from backing up into 
the home.
Unfortunately, the trap’s water-trapping ability extends to hair, grease, debris, 
and soap scum. This makes a p-trap the number-one location of clogs in the 
sewer system. If the p-trap becomes only slightly clogged, then you experi-
ence slow drainage in the fixture. Oh, you say the toilet is the place where all 
the clogs occur at your house. The toilet has the largest p-trap of any fixture 
in the home. Had to pull any toys out of yours lately?
You can prevent drain clogs by being careful about what you put in the drain 
and by performing monthly preventive cleaning, as explained in the earlier 
section “Keeping Your System Clog-Free.” But if these measures don’t work 
and you experience slow draining in your fixture, try cleaning the p-trap to 
avoid a full-blown blockage. You need:
 
✓ 1 small plastic bucket
 
✓ 1 rag
 
✓ 1 large pair of pliers or a pipe wrench
 
✓ 1 portable light

180
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
Before beginning, remove everything from under the sink so that you have 
ample room to work. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Position the plastic bucket directly under the p-trap.
 
2. Using the pliers, remove the two coupling nuts that attach the trap to 
the sink tailpiece and to the adjacent wall fitting.
 
 If these nuts won’t budge, or if they simply fall apart when you try to 
move them, it’s time to purchase a replacement trap.
 
3. Clean the interior of the trap with a straightened wire coat hanger or 
a large nylon bottle brush.
 
 Make sure that all the parts are completely clean inside and out. A piece 
of debris lodged between a drain washer and the drainpipe can cause 
a leak.
 
 Use the cleaning as an opportunity to inspect all the washers — they 
should be soft and supple. (Don’t you just love that description? Go 
to the hardware store or home center and ask for “soft, supple drain 
washers.”) If they aren’t soft, you need to replace them.
 
4. If you discover that the trap is clean and clear (and not the reason for 
the clog or slow draining), then insert a small retractable drain snake 
directly into the drain or, if the p-trap has been removed, directly into 
the pipe in the wall.
 
 Work the snake in and out while rotating the handle clockwise.
 
5. Reassemble the trap.
 
 Make sure that each washer is properly seated. Twisting can be a real 
problem. Don’t over-tighten the connections. At first, the coupling nuts 
should be no more than hand-tight. If a leak persists, continue to tighten 
a little at a time until the leak disappears. If increased tightening doesn’t 
do the trick, chances are, the washers are dirty, twisted, or defective. 
Try again!
If cleaning doesn’t solve your p-trap problems, pick up the telephone and call 
a plumber or sewer-and-drain specialist who has the expertise and proper 
tools to get things flowing freely.
 
If all the drains in the home are running slowly, the main sewer line may be the 
problem. Skip all these steps and go straight to the plumber.

181
 Chapter 9: Plumbing, Part III: Sewer and Septic Systems
Your Sewer System’s Fall
If you repeatedly have drainage problems, and you’ve determined that all 
waste lines, vents, and p-traps are clean and clear, then the fall (the down-
ward slope of the pipes), or actually the lack of fall, could be the problem.
One thing you don’t want is a sewer system that looks like a set of roller-coaster 
tracks — up and down, up and down. Sewers work best when the waste lines 
slope downhill. In fact, they don’t really work very well at all otherwise.
The National Plumbing Code requires sewer lines to fall (slope downward) at 
a rate of 1/8 inch per foot (which equals 1 inch every 8 feet). We think the mini-
mum should be twice as much. There is no maximum fall — the more the better.
If fall is an issue, call a plumber to correct the problem. We don’t recommend 
major sewer work as a DIY project.
Maintaining Your Septic System
If you live in a rural area or have vacation property in the middle of nowhere, 
you’re no doubt familiar with the form and function of a septic system (see 
Figure 9-4). In brief, a septic system is your very own onsite sewage treatment 
facility. It’s used primarily where access to a municipal sewer system is nei-
ther available nor economically practical. A septic system is out of sight and 
is odorless (when properly maintained).
A septic system is reasonably maintenance-free. A well-constructed, properly 
maintained tank could last indefinitely. However, the leach field (the under-
ground area where all of the sewage drainpipes are located) will most likely 
require some treatment or perhaps replacement after about 15 to 20 years of 
service.
Following a few simple rules — like not using too much water and not depos-
iting materials in the septic tank that bacteria can’t decompose — should help 
to make a septic system trouble-free for many years. But don’t forget that the 
septic tank does need to be cleaned out when too many solids build up.

Being careful about what goes in
Be mindful about what you and your family put into your septic system. It 
doesn’t take much to upset the delicate biological balance within the tank. 
You can extend the life of a septic system by watching everything that’s intro-
duced to the system.
 
Keep in mind the following recommendations:
 
✓ Too much water can upset the delicate biological balance within the 
tank, thus defeating its ability to work wonders. Moreover, discharging 
more water into the system than it can handle can cause it to back up — 
not a desirable occurrence.
 
✓ Don’t use excessive amounts of any household chemicals. You can use 
normal amounts of household detergents, bleaches, drain cleaners, and 
other household chemicals without stopping the bacterial action in the 
septic tank. But, for example, don’t dump cleaning water for latex paint-
brushes and cans into the house sewer.
 
✓ Don’t deposit coffee grounds, cooking fats, wet-strength towels (paper 
towels that don’t dissolve easily, like the heavy-duty kind), disposable 
diapers, facial tissues, cigarette butts, and other non-decomposable 
materials into the house sewer. These materials won’t decompose, will 
fill the septic tank, and will plug the system.

183
 Chapter 9: Plumbing, Part III: Sewer and Septic Systems
 
 Use a high-quality toilet tissue that breaks up easily when wet. One way 
to find out if your toilet paper fits this description is to put a handful of 
toilet tissue in a fruit jar half-full of water. Shake the jar, and if the tissue 
breaks up easily, the product is suitable for the septic tank.
 
✓ Avoid dumping grease down the drain. It may plug sewer pipes or 
build up in the septic tank and plug the inlet. Keep a separate container 
for waste grease and throw it out with the garbage.
 
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, because of the presence 
of significant numbers and types of bacteria, enzymes, yeasts, and other fungi 
and microorganisms in typical residential and commercial wastewaters, the 
use of septic-system additives containing these or any other ingredients is not 
recommended.
Cleaning and pumping your septic tank
You need to have your septic tank pumped and cleaned by a professional 
every one to three years. A septic tank in a northern climate will need to have 
the solids removed more often than a tank farther south. (This geographic 
variance is primarily because cooler temperatures inhibit bacterial action 
and provide less decomposition of the sewage solids.) How often you need 
to have your septic tank pumped also depends on the size of the tank, the 
volume of wastewater, and how many solids go into it. Constant foul odor, 
slow drains, and drains that back up are all telltale signs that your septic tank 
needs pumping. When in doubt, call in a septic pro.

Heating, Ventilating, and 
Air-Conditioning Systems
In This Chapter
▶ Keeping your furnace and boiler happy
▶ Ventilating your home from top to bottom
▶ Keeping your air-conditioning cool
W
e can describe heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) with 
just four words: hot, cold, in, and out. Or, more specifically: heating 
the interior when it’s cold outside; cooling the interior when it’s hot outside; 
drawing fresh air into your home to moderate temperatures and humidity; 
and venting moist, smoky, greasy, or stinky air from inside to outside.
And this brings us to the paradox of HVAC: These seemingly simple pro-
cesses actually rely on some complex technology. As a result, there are very 
few maintenance tasks that don’t bring with them a high likelihood of killing 
the furnace, the air conditioner, or yourself. But the tasks that can be done by 
a do-it-yourselfer are easy and non-threatening. We’re confident you can do 
them without difficulty or danger — and they’ll make a huge difference in the 
efficiency, performance, and life of your system, whatever kind it is.
Making Friends with the Monster: 
Your Furnace
Most grown-ups never would admit it, but they’re terrified of their furnaces. 
A furnace is a big, complicated piece of machinery. But we’re here to tell 
you that there’s nothing to be afraid of. Your furnace is less mysterious and 
scary than you think. It heats up air or water, and then moves hot air, water, 
or steam around the house. It’s really that simple. In this section, we tell you 
what you need to do to maintain your furnace.

186
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
Taking care of a forced-air system
In a forced-air system, air is heated as it passes through the furnace (shown 
in Figure 10-1). A blower and a system of ducts take the warmed air through-
out the house, and then cooled air is sucked into return ducts back to the fur-
nace. You need to take care of your forced-air system to keep it running safely 
at peak efficiency.

The parts of your furnace and their locations may be different from the 
illustrations in this book. For specifics on your furnace, consult the owner’s 
manual that came with the furnace. (You probably filed it under “Manuals I’ll 
Never Look At.”) You may be able to get more information, a diagram, or even 
the manual, from the manufacturer’s Web site.
Inspecting and servicing a forced-air furnace
Forced-air furnaces must be inspected and serviced every year before the 
heating season begins. Follow these steps:

187
 Chapter 10: Heating, Ventilating, and Air-Conditioning Systems
 
1. Look for the sticker that the last serviceperson affixed to the outside 
of the housing.
 
2. Hold a flashlight between your chin and shoulder while you write 
down the company name and phone number located on the sticker.
 
 If you’re young and have great vision or if your furnace is located in a 
basement, attic, or garage that is well lit, you may be able to do without 
the flashlight.
 
3. Call that company to arrange for a professional inspection and service.
 
Kidding aside, it’s critically important to have a qualified, licensed heating con-
tractor (or, euphemistically, a “home-comfort specialist”) inspect and service 
your forced-air system. Sure, you could save $90 by not having your furnace 
inspected at all, but a dirty, inefficient furnace costs you ten times that much 
per year in wasted fuel.
 
Even more important, a cracked heat exchanger or dislodged flue could fill 
your home with deadly carbon-monoxide gas. Plain and simple, an under-
maintained or failing furnace is a danger to you and your family.
So what will the furnace serviceperson do? First, he’ll carefully inspect and 
check every critical component. Then he’ll perform dozens of maintenance 
tasks (lubrication, adjustment, and so on) that will help maintain, and even 
improve, your furnace’s efficiency and go a long way toward keeping it run-
ning well year after year.
Replacing the filter
The easiest furnace-maintenance task is replacing the filter. During the heating 
season, you should replace your furnace filter every month. If an air conditioner 
is part of the same system, you should change the filter every month year-round.
The filter, typically fiberglass or pleated fabric, is designed to take dust, dirt, 
pollen, lint, carpet fibers, and pet hair and dander out of the air, which keeps 
your home cleaner and keeps allergies at bay. Without all that stuff in the air-
flow and inside the unit, the blower motor lasts longer, and other parts of the 
heating system work better. The filter also prevents the air-conditioner evap-
orator coil (hidden within the unit) from becoming clogged — that’s a good 
thing, because when the evaporator coil is clogged, the air conditioner’s effi-
ciency is reduced, and your utility bill runs sky-high.
 
If your furnace uses a standard 1-inch disposable filter, don’t bother buying 
fancy, ultra-high-efficient filters. The pleated kind is fine. The filter is tightly 
woven and won’t let large particles pass, and the pleats double the filtration 
area, resulting in less stress on the system blower. Unless your home is her-
metically sealed, you never open a window or a door, and you’ve removed all 
inside allergy sources (which is extremely unlikely), those mega-filters don’t 

188
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
provide benefits commensurate with their significantly higher cost. And they 
may reduce airflow and cause the blower to strain to push air through their 
thicker, tighter filtering medium. Don’t believe us? Ask your serviceman. He’ll 
back us up on this.
Why do we like pleated filters better than the typical spun-fiberglass filters? 
Because they actually work. You can see for yourself: Lay a standard fiber-
glass filter flat on a table, and shake some table salt onto it. If the filter allows 
salt to pass through (which it will), how can it snag a microscopic grain of 
pollen? Now, perform the same experiment using a pleated filter. Look mom, 
no salt! A pleated filter does add some resistance to airflow, but not enough 
to make a difference.
 
Don’t buy 1-inch filters one at a time — get a whole case. They’re cheaper by 
the dozen. What’s more, the box sits by the furnace and reminds you to do 
the monthly change. And you’ll never miss a change because you don’t have a 
filter on hand. Want to make extra-sure you don’t forget? We have a friend who 
opens the box as soon as he gets home from the store and labels each one 
with the month in which he’ll install it. We think that’s smart. Try it!
To replace the filter, follow these steps:
 
1. Locate the filter slot.
 
 You can usually find the filter near where the cool air enters the furnace — 
in the cold-air return duct, or at the entrance to the blower chamber. 
Though redundant, sometimes you’ll find filters in both locations — 
typically a washable filter at the furnace and a replaceable fabric filter at 
the cold-air return. (If it’s not where the cool air enters the furnace, look 
in the main return air register, which is on the wall or ceiling somewhere 
in your home.)
 
2. Slide out the old, dirty filter.
 
 You may have to jockey it back and forth a bit.
 
3. Remove the wrapping from the new filter (if any), and locate the air-
flow arrows on the side.
 
4. Position the filter so that the airflow arrows point toward the blower 
and with the flow of cold air.
 
5. Slide in the new filter, being careful not to dent, deform, or tear the 
cardboard frame.
 
6. Check to make sure the filter is snugly in place and all the way in 
its slot.

189
 Chapter 10: Heating, Ventilating, and Air-Conditioning Systems
Some furnaces have more-complicated, wider filters that slide into a plas-
tic housing that, in turn, slides into a wide slot. Follow the manufacturer’s 
instructions for replacing the filter, and then slide the housing into place.
Other furnaces have permanent filters. These filters usually don’t need to be 
cleaned as often as the less sophisticated fabric filters. Cleaning instructions 
usually are affixed near the filter on the side of the furnace or in the owner’s 
manual. Consult a pro when in doubt.
Cleaning the blower compartment
The blower is a large “squirrel cage” fan (see Figure 10-2) that pushes air out 
through the ducts to the registers throughout the home. The blower also 
draws air through return registers into the return ducts and into the unit to 
be reheated or re-cooled and recirculated. You need to clean it twice a year. 
Here’s how:
 
1. Before you do anything, turn off the power to the unit.
 
 A service/emergency switch may be mounted on the furnace itself or 
near it. If you can’t find the switch, turn off the power at the circuit 
breaker or fuse box.
 
2. Open the access panel on the front or side (if it isn’t already open to 
change the filter).
 
 You may need a screwdriver or socket wrench to do this.
 
3. Locate the blower, and remove the blower access panel.
 
 The blower will have an access panel that is held on by slip-fit hooks or 
retaining screws.
 
4. Use the vacuum cleaner with the upholstery brush attachment on it to 
remove any dirt, lint, and dust bunnies you find.
 
5. Replace the blower access panel.
 
6. Replace the access panel, making sure it’s in correctly and tightly 
closed.
 
7. Turn on the power to the unit.
 
Whenever you’re poking around inside your forced-air unit, be careful not to 
disturb any of the small wires inside the unit. Most systems have low-voltage 
controls, so you can’t get zapped, but if you inadvertently dislodge a control 
wire, the system may not come back on.

Checking, replacing, and adjusting the blower-fan belt and pulleys
If your furnace is not a newer model, you need to keep your eye on the 
blower-fan belt. (If you have a newer furnace, you won’t be able to find the 
belt or a fan — the blower is driven directly by a motor.) A worn, wimpy belt 
can fail at any time, and it always seems to do so at the most inconvenient 
time — like midnight on Christmas Eve. A loose belt won’t fail, but it will 
make a squealing noise that can drive you crazy. More important, a loose belt 
costs you money because, if the belt is slipping, the blower doesn’t turn as it 
should. Plus, if the blower isn’t blowing hard enough, you’re getting weaker 
airflow and less hot air for your money.
To check the fan belt, turn off the power to the unit, remove the access panel, 
and look for fraying, cracks, slippage, and so on. If the belt is frayed, cracked, 
or otherwise worn-looking, you must replace it as soon as possible. If the belt 
is loose (with more than 1/2 inch of give), you must tighten it.
You can also inspect and adjust the pulleys. The belt rides on two pulleys: 
one connected to the motor and the other connected to the blower. The pul-
leys often have lubrication points that should receive a few drops of oil each 
time the system is serviced.
You can address all these problems by taking the steps in the following sections.
Replacing the belt
To replace the belt, follow these steps:
 
1. Turn off the power to the unit.

191
 Chapter 10: Heating, Ventilating, and Air-Conditioning Systems
 
2. Remove the access panel (if you haven’t already done so).
 
3. Loosen the adjusting bolt on the motor just enough to get some slack.
 
4. Slip the belt off the pulleys.
 
5. Go to your local hardware store or home center and buy two replace-
ment belts.
 
 Take the old belt with you to make sure you get the right replacement. 
Keep the extra belt in a plastic bag on a nail by the furnace. That way, 
you have one on hand when you have a middle-of-the-night, all-the-
stores-are-closed, the-house-is-freezing, blower-fan belt emergency.
 
6. Put the new belt back on the pulleys and tighten the adjustment bolt 
until the belt has only 1/2 inch of give.
 
7. Replace the access panel and turn on the power to the unit.
Tightening and adjusting the belt
The belt should have no more than a 1/2 inch of give when you press on it with 
your finger. If it gives any more than that, you need to tighten it.
To tighten the belt, follow these steps:
 
1. Turn off the power to the unit.
 
2. Remove the access panel (if you haven’t already done so).
 
3. Slightly loosen the motor adjustment bolt.
 
4. Slide the motor a little bit at a time to increase tension on the belt 
until you have about 1/2 inch of give.
 
 Don’t over-tighten the belt. A too-tight belt will damage the motor and 
fan bearings.
 
5. Double-check to make sure the belt has 1/2 inch of give.
 
6. Tighten the bolt.
 
7. Replace the access panel and turn on the power to the unit.
Checking and adjusting the pulley alignment
When the pulleys aren’t aligned, they can twist the fan belt and cause it to 
wear quickly or even break. To check and adjust the pulley alignment, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Turn off the power to the unit.
 
2. Remove the access panel (if you haven’t already done so).
 
3. Place a ruler against the pulley faces.
 
4. Check to see that the pulleys line up perfectly and that the belt travels

5. If the pulley alignment is off, slightly loosen the motor-pulley mount-
ing bolts, adjust the motor pulley to align it with the other pulleys, 
and then retighten the mounting bolts.
 
6. Recheck the alignment using the ruler and readjust as necessary.
 
7. When the alignment is perfect, replace the access panel and turn on 
the power to the unit.
Taking care of your ducts
Ducts are square or round metal tubes in the ceiling, walls, and/or floors that 
transport air from the furnace to each room in the house. A leak in a duct 
can allow massive amounts of heat into the attic, crawlspace, or basement. 
Keeping the ducts tightly sealed ensures that all the expensive heated air 
coming from the furnace gets to where it belongs.
Leaks aren’t the only issue with ducts, though. Even with a serious commit-
ment to filter replacement, the inside of ducts eventually get a coating of 
fibers, lint, dirt, allergens, mildew, grease, and even bacteria.
Checking the ducts for leaks
If you have access to your ducts, checking for leaks is easy:
 
1. Follow each duct from the furnace to its termination, paying special 
attention to the joints between segments.
 
2. Look for fuzz that has been forced through joints, or feel for warm air 
coming through gaps.
 
 You may need to pull insulation away from the joints and visually 
inspect them. Dark stripes in the fiberglass insulation is a telltale sign of 
a duct leak below the insulation. Other big leak locations are around the 
boot (the piece where the duct penetrates your wall, floor, or ceiling).
 
If you really want to identify how leaky your ducts are, bring in a pro to per-
form a duct pressure test. This test involves pressurizing the entire duct 
system, which determines how much of your heated or cooled air is being 
wasted. A duct pressure test usually runs in the neighborhood of $100 to $200, 
depending on the size of your home and where you live.
Sealing leaks
If you find any leaks during your inspection, seal them:
 
✓ If your leak is below the duct insulation, seal it with metal duct tape. 
(not the fabric duct tape that you’re used to using and that you can use 
on just about anything other than ducts).
 
 Alternatively, use an elastomeric duct sealant (available at most home 
centers or hardware stores). When dry, the elastomeric duct sealant 

193
 Chapter 10: Heating, Ventilating, and Air-Conditioning Systems
provides a rubbery, airtight seal at all joints and seams; it bonds flexible 
ducts to metal duct fittings.
 
 You can also call in a heating pro to do the job for you.
 
✓ If your leak is around the boot, remove the register cover and caulk the 
joint between the boot and the wallboard.
 
 As an alternative, you can use a butyl-backed tape to seal the gap — 
this method is the one that the pros use. Be sure that you position the 
tape in the right place because, after it’s applied, this stuff sticks like 
heck. Use a utility knife with a sharp blade to trim any tape that may be 
exposed after replacing the register cover.
 
Got a big duct dent? Have damaged duct segments come completely apart? 
Call an HVAC pro to fix them. The pros know all kinds of tricks for repairing 
damage, large and small. They even have a metal patch that they slip in and 
affix to the damaged area with an elastomeric sealant.
Cleaning the ducts
Checking and cleaning your ducts every few years is smart. Why? Because 
clean air is healthy air.
But cleaning ducts is not a job for a do-it-yourselfer — access is difficult (you 
have to take apart the ducts in several places), and duct cleaning requires 
specialized equipment (a mega-vacuum!) and skills. Call a pro. The pro will 
have all the tools and high-tech equipment that’ll scrub the inside of your 
ducts and suck up the dirt without putting it right back into your home.
Balancing a central heating system
Are some rooms in your home too hot, some too cold, and some just right? 
You need to fine-tune your system for maximum efficiency, minimum energy 
consumption, and even temperatures in every room. It’s about airflow, and 
dampers and registers help control the airflow in the ducts.
Here’s how to balance your central heating system:
 
1. Start at the furnace unit and follow the main ducts outward, looking 
for small levers on the side; these are the handles for dampers.
 
 When the handle is horizontal, the damper is fully open, allowing maxi-
mum airflow. When the handle is anywhere between horizontal and ver-
tical, the damper is reducing airflow.
 
2. Place thermometers in the rooms in question, away from registers 
and cold-air returns, and all at about the same height from the floor.
 
3. Turn on the heat and open all the dampers, wait about an hour, and 
then check the thermometers.
 
 Is one room warmer than others? Is hot air roaring out of the register?

194
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
 
4. Partially close the damper in the duct that feeds that room by moving 
the handle one-third of the way between horizontal and vertical; wait 
an hour and recheck the room.
 
5. If the room seems cooler, you’re done. If it doesn’t, close the damper 
another third, wait another hour, and check the room again.
 
 You also can fine-tune airflow by adjusting the register.
 
6. Repeat steps 2 through 5 for each room until you have the tempera-
ture balanced.
 
 By the way, balanced may mean that the main living areas and bath-
rooms are warmer than the bedrooms, or vice versa. It all depends on 
what you prefer . . . or how cold your spouse claims to be.
 
7. After you’ve achieved balance, go back to the ducts and use a per-
manent marker to write a W (for winter) where the damper handle 
should be positioned for the heating season.
Repeat the process for the cooling season, except write an S (for summer) 
where the damper handle should be positioned.
Hot-water systems
Hot-water, or hydronic, systems use a gas- or oil-fired burner to heat a tank 
of water to near boiling, and then circulate it with a pump throughout the 
house to radiators or baseboard convectors, and then back to the boiler to 
be reheated and make the round-trip again (see Figure 10-3).
Seems simple? Not so much, actually. As with forced-air systems, most main-
tenance tasks are beyond the skills of the do-it-yourselfer. Call in a qualified, 
licensed heating contractor to do an annual inspection and cleaning.
When to replace a forced-air furnace
How do you know when your furnace is on 
its last legs? When its old technology makes 
it unacceptably inefficient and expensive. In 
general, if your system is more than 15 years 
old, replacing it with a new Energy Star–rated 
system will save you money, prevent mainte-
nance headaches, and keep you warmer and 
more comfortable. (If your system is less than 
15 years old, regular maintenance probably is 
the way to go.)
Money talks. By replacing an older furnace 
(which is typically 60 percent efficient) with a 
new furnace (typically 90 percent efficient, or 
better), you can cut your heating bills in half! 
Don’t believe it? Furnace manufacturer Web 
sites offer calculators that help determine 
energy savings and payback timeframes.

Don’t be penny-wise and pound-foolish. A dirty, inefficient boiler costs you far 
more than a service call. The serviceman will catch little problems before they 
become big trouble. And a neglected system will fail many years before a well-
maintained one.
Gauging the pressure
Most hot-water systems have only a single gauge, located on the main unit, 
which measures three things: pressure, temperature, and altitude (the height 
of the water in the system).
To monitor the performance of your hot-water system, keep an (occasional) 
eye on the pressure. Most boilers run at 12 to 15 pounds per square inch 
(psi) of pressure. If the pressure is lower or higher, something is wrong.
Low pressure most often is caused by a low water level. The system’s auto-
matic filling system should maintain the proper water level. But if yours 
doesn’t, you can manually fill the boiler by opening the water feed valve on 
the incoming supply pipe. Just open the valve and keep it open until the pres-
sure gets to 12 psi. Then call a repairman.
High pressure usually is caused by too much water in the expansion tank; 
read on to find out what to do in that case.

196
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
Draining the expansion tank
Located overhead near the boiler, a conventional expansion tank is cylindri-
cal and has a drain valve at one end. To drain excess water from the expan-
sion tank:
 
1. Turn off the power, turn off the water supply to the boiler, and let the 
tank cool.
 
2. Attach a garden hose to the drain valve, open it, and let water out 
until the levels of the pressure gauges on the boiler and the expansion 
tank match.
 
3. Close the valve, turn the power back on, and reopen the water supply.
If you have a diaphragm expansion tank, the pressure problem isn’t too much 
water; it’s too little air. You need to recharge the expansion tank. Use an ordi-
nary tire-pressure gauge to check the air pressure. If it’s lower than the rec-
ommended psi (look on the tank for the correct reading), use a bicycle pump 
to juice it back up.
When the expansion tank has been drained or the diaphragm tank refilled, 
restart the system and carefully monitor it. If the pressure goes back up, turn 
off the system and pick up the phone. You’ve done all you can do — it’s time 
to call an expert!
 
Boilers must have a proper pressure-relief valve, located at the top of the 
unit. This important valve opens when the pressure reaches 30 psi — to pre-
vent the boiler from exploding. If you ever see water draining out of the relief 
valve, chances are, the system is operating under excessively high pressure 
and should be shut down immediately — and stay shut down until it can be 
checked by a professional.
Bleeding the radiators
Bleeding radiators is sometimes necessary in even the best of systems. If 
you have a radiator in your system that just won’t heat, chances are, it’s air-
locked. Bleeding the air out of the radiator relieves the pressure and allows 
the system to fill normally.
To bleed the radiators, look for a small valve at the top. When you’ve found 
it, turn it about a quarter-turn counterclockwise and keep the screwdriver or 
radiator key in the valve. If you hear a hissing sound, that’s good — it’s air 
escaping. As soon as the hissing stops and you see a dribble of water come 
out, close the valve.
 
Don’t open the valve more than is necessary; hot water will come rushing out 
before you can close it. At the very least, you’ll make a wet mess. At the worst, 
you could be scalded. Don’t forget to wear eye protection and rain gear when 
working with water that’s under pressure.

197
 Chapter 10: Heating, Ventilating, and Air-Conditioning Systems
Steam systems
As with forced-air and hot-water systems (see the previous sections), it pays 
to have a professional, licensed contractor check your steam system every 
year. Not only will you save money in the long run through greater efficiency, 
but you’ll also have peace of mind knowing that your system is operating 
safely. We cannot emphasize this point enough.
Most adjustments to your steam boiler should be performed by a pro. But 
there are three important things you can do by yourself:
 
✓ Check the steam gauge on a regular basis — every couple of days. 
Make sure it’s within the normal range. If it isn’t, shut down the system 
immediately and call for service.
 
✓ Check the safety valve once a month. Located on the top of the boiler, 
this important valve vents excess pressure if the boiler goes crazy and 
exceeds safe levels. When the system is hot, push down on the handle 
to see if steam comes out. Make sure to stand away from the outlet, 
because the steam is boiling hot. If no steam comes out, call a service-
man to replace the valve immediately.
 
✓ Check the water level once a month. The water-level gauge has valves 
on each side. Open them both and make sure that the water level is in 
the middle, and then close the valves. If you didn’t see any water, shut 
off the boiler, let it cool down, and add water.
 
Because steam systems occasionally need water added, consider adding an 
automatic water valve to your system. The valve will monitor water levels and, 
if the system needs it, add water ever so slowly to avoid damaging the boiler.
Maintaining your radiators
You also can do a few things to keep your radiators working well:
 
✓ Make sure that every radiator slopes slightly toward the steam inlet 
pipe (the one that comes out of the wall or floor). If one doesn’t, slip a 
little 1/4-inch-thick rectangle of wood under the feet at the vent end (as 
shown in Figure 10-4). This helps prevent those irritating knocking and 
clanging noises.
 
✓ Check the vents to make sure they aren’t blocked. Corrosion and paint 
can keep the vent from venting, and then air trapped in the radiator pre-
vents steam from entering the radiator. If your vent is blocked, replace 
it. Your local hardware store probably carries a vent. The vents simply 
screw off and on, so they’re easy to replace.
 
✓ Check the position of the inlet valves. The valves should be either all 
the way closed or all the way open. A partially open or shut valve does 
nothing to regulate the heat, and it causes knocking and clanging.

Fixing leaks at the inlet valves
If your inlet valve is leaking, chances are, it’s actually leaking at the cap nuts 
(the big nuts at the vertical and horizontal connections). Luckily, a leak there 
can be cured with a little retightening. Get two big wrenches — use one to 
hold the valve and the other to tighten the cap nut. If the leak seems to be 
coming from under the valve handle, take off the valve head and tighten the 
topmost nut, which (amusingly) is called the gland nut.
If neither of those solutions fixes the leak, the valve adapter — the double-ended/
double-threaded clunk of brass that connects the valve to the radiator — is 
probably the culprit. Once again, you need two wrenches to remove the 
valve, remove the adapter, and install a replacement. Open the valve, check 
for leaks, and make extra-sure that everything is properly tightened.
Electric systems
In an electric heating system, electrical resistance creates heat, which is radi-
ated into rooms using baseboard units, or in cables in the ceiling or floor. 
Installations of electric heating systems hit their peak in the 1960s, when 
electricity rates were low. But now, at least in areas of the country not near 
a hydroelectric dam, the cost of electricity makes these systems very, very 
expensive to operate. If you have one, you’re probably paying twice as much 
to heat your house as a neighbor with a gas-fired furnace or boiler.

199
 Chapter 10: Heating, Ventilating, and Air-Conditioning Systems
That’s the bad news. The good news is that electric heating, whether deliv-
ered via baseboard convectors or radiant floor or ceiling systems, requires 
you to do virtually nothing to maintain it. The only two things you have to do:
 
✓ Vacuum the convectors once a month (if you have them).
 
✓ Pay the big electricity bill.
Ventilation: Letting Your House Breathe
When we talk about ventilation, we’re actually talking about two different 
things: interior ventilation and structural ventilation. Proper interior ventila-
tion is vital to the health and comfort of your family; it helps your home rid 
itself of moisture, smoke, cooking odors, and indoor pollutants. Good struc-
tural ventilation controls heat levels in the attic, moderates dampness in the 
crawlspace and basement, and keeps moisture out of uninsulated walls.
Interior ventilation
Kitchens, bathrooms, and laundry rooms are the biggest sources of moisture 
and odors. The secret to having a dry, stink-free home is to have three key 
exhaust units — a range hood, and bathroom and laundry exhaust fans — all 
of which should be exhausted to the exterior.
Range hoods
Many kitchens have a range hood that doesn’t actually vent to anywhere — 
it just “filters” and recycles stovetop air back into the room. But it’s much 
better to get the greasy, smoky, steamy air outside, and that requires duct-
work to an exterior vent.
So, if your kitchen is perpetually stinky, and the walls are covered with a thin 
film of grease, take a two-pronged approach to fixing the problem:
 
✓ Stop eating so much fried food.
 
✓ Get an exterior-venting exhaust fan. (Your favorite appliance retailer can 
make it happen for you.)
 
If you just can’t give up Mama’s Special Sunday Fried Chicken and Homemade 
Hash Browns, you should know that airborne grease makes exhaust fans 
sticky, which in turn attracts dirt and dust. The key to preventing this process 
from getting out of control is regular cleaning:

200
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
 
✓ Clean the grill and fan blades twice a year, or whenever they start to 
look bad. Use a spray-on nonchemical degreaser. (Test it first to make 
sure it won’t remove paint.) Follow with a mild soap and water wash. 
Finally, flush with fresh water and towel-dry.
 
✓ Clean the filter in a recycling range hood every couple of months or 
so (depending on how or what you cook). We clean our range hood fil-
ters in the dishwasher — works great! If your filter has charcoal pellets 
inside, you need to replace it annually.
 
✓ Clean the fan and housing every six months. Lots of grease and gunk 
can build up on the fan housing. Over time, it can produce a foul smell 
that will rival anything cooking in Mama’s kitchen. Use a spray-on 
nonchemical degreaser and a sponge to clean the housing. Rinse with 
fresh water and towel-dry.
Bathroom exhaust fans
Bathrooms generate huge amounts of moisture and some unpleasant 
odors — especially at my brother’s house. If you’ve got incurable mildew in 
the shower, wallpaper peeling off the walls, or a lingering funky smell, you 
need to either install an exhaust fan or get a bigger, higher-capacity fan. 
Exhaust fans can be installed to vent the bad air through the wall or through 
the ceiling and attic. Call an electrical contractor, not your brother-in-law, 
to do the work.
Steamy air, hairspray, and other grooming products create a tacky surface 
that attracts dust, dirt, and fuzz at an alarming rate. Clean the housing, grill, 
and fan at least twice a year, using the same techniques for cleaning that we 
suggest in the preceding section.
 
Place a bath fan on a timer. It allows the fan to run for several minutes after 
you’ve left the space to fully remove odors or excessive moisture from show-
ering. A timer is a must for the kids’ bathroom!
Laundry exhaust fans
Laundry exhaust fans and bathroom fans are one and the same — as is the 
care and maintenance. The only difference is that a laundry fan doesn’t usu-
ally have to deal with odors, and the moisture content isn’t as high in a laun-
dry room as it is in a bathroom, so a laundry exhaust fan doesn’t need to be 
quite as powerful.
 
Quieter fans cost more than fans that are not so quiet, but a less expensive, 
not-so-quiet model will do just fine.

201
 Chapter 10: Heating, Ventilating, and Air-Conditioning Systems
Structural ventilation
There are two kinds of structural ventilation:
 
✓ Passive ventilation: Passive ventilation uses the natural airflow gener-
ated by convection (hot air rising, cold air falling).
 
✓ Active ventilation: Active ventilation uses fans to do the work.
To keep heat and moisture from roasting and rotting your home over time, 
you need adequate ventilation in the attic, crawlspace, and (if it’s unfinished) 
the basement:
 
✓ Attic: In the attic, passive ventilation creates an upward flow of air. 
Warm air rises and goes out through vent(s) near to, or at the peak of, 
the roof, drawing cool air through vents in the eaves or soffits.
 
✓ Crawlspace: In the crawlspace, where upward flow is impossible, pas-
sive cross-ventilation (the movement of air from one side of a space to 
the other) is created by placing vents on each exterior wall.
 
✓ Basement: In the basement, the HVAC system moves air around (active), 
and operable windows enable cross-ventilation (passive) when weather 
permits.
Ventilation — passive or active — won’t work if insulation, crud, or dead 
squirrels block the vents, or if you don’t have enough vents. Poor ventila-
tion can result in an attic and subarea that are damp and “tropical.” Rot can 
develop in the wood framing and do great damage over time. Condensed 
water can soak insulation, making it ineffective and mildewed. Condensation 
from above and below can make its way into the house, ruining ceiling, floor, 
and wall finishes, and short-circuiting electrical wiring. If you notice that your 
vents are clogged, clear them immediately.
 
Building codes specify how much ventilation you need. As a general rule, have 
1 square foot of vent area for every 150 square feet of attic area or crawlspace. 
We think more is better.
Attic ventilation
If your attic space is hot and humid in the summer, you may need to install 
additional vents at the eaves and at the ridge of the roof. Assuming you’re not 
a trained carpenter or roofer, we think it’s best to leave this kind of work to 
a professional, someone who knows her way around the roof structure and 
knows how to install leak-free roof penetrations.

202
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
Make sure that each vent and screen is painted (to prevent deterioration) 
and that the screens are secure to the frame of the vent. Animals, baseballs, 
and other common household missiles have a way of dislodging vent screens. 
Replace badly damaged vents. Solid vent screens prevent varmints of all 
sorts from settling in your attic.
 
Cardboard or prefab Styrofoam baffles can be used to prevent insulation from 
being blown into piles, leaving bare spots. Alternatively, they can prevent 
blown insulation from blocking air flow from eave vents. You can buy insula-
tion baffles from home centers or insulation companies. The baffles are easy 
to install. They fit between rafters where eave vents are located and are held 
in place with staples. When installed properly, air passes over the baffle and 
up the underside of the roof sheathing, and the insulation stays put!
Crawlspace ventilation
If your crawlspace is damp, moist air can cause rot in the wood frame, attack-
ing your home from below. Just like the attic (see the preceding section), a 
crawlspace needs a good flow of fresh air. If your crawlspace feels clammy, 
or you see mildew on the walls or structure, you need better ventilation — 
called foundation vents.
Extra vents are difficult to install and require special tools to cut through 
lumber, concrete block, concrete, stucco, and brick. Don’t go poking holes in 
your foundation on your own — call a carpenter or masonry contractor to do 
the work. They have the know-how, tools, and experience to do the job right.
Foundation vents can be damaged in the same way as eave vents. In fact, 
because they’re closer to the ground, there is greater potential for damage. 
Critters that can’t get into your attic will settle for the area beneath the floor. 
Establish a no-holes policy. Maintain foundation vents in the same way that 
we suggest for eave vents: Make sure they’re painted and securely attached, 
and replace any that become badly damaged.
 
Does your crawlspace have a dirt floor? If so, you may be able to avoid adding 
vents by installing a plastic vapor barrier. See Chapter 4 for instructions on 
how to do this.
Basement ventilation
A basement can get mighty musty, especially when moisture can make its 
way in through cracks in basement walls and floors. For this reason, ventila-
tion is particularly important to eliminate moisture and odors.
Ventilation in a basement can be had in a variety of ways. If your furnace is 
located in your basement, you can introduce a small amount of air through 

203
 Chapter 10: Heating, Ventilating, and Air-Conditioning Systems
a supply duct that moves the air and provides a little bit of heat — assuming 
the space is not occupied. A finished basement can have all the comforts of 
home — supply and return air ducts, exhaust fans, and moisture-control sys-
tems, such as a dehumidifier or water-collection and sump system.
 
If your basement has a window and it doesn’t work, fix it! There is no substi-
tute for natural light and ventilation. A little bit of sunlight throughout the day 
can create natural air currents that can help control moisture and odors.
Troubleshooting thermostats
Is your house too hot or too cool? Your problem 
could be the thermostat. Some potential causes:
 ✓ It’s in a bad location. The thermostat 
shouldn’t be located over a lamp, over a TV, 
or near any heat source. Drafts will read as 
lower temperatures and send wrong com-
mands to the air conditioner or furnace.
 ✓ It needs cleaning. When older mechanical 
thermostats malfunction, those with lever-
set temperatures and contact switches 
usually need cleaning only. To clean your 
thermostat, remove the cover and dust 
inside with a soft brush. To clean contacts, 
slip a piece of paper between them, moving 
the paper very lightly back and forth.
 ✓ Its anticipator needs adjustment. If your 
air conditioner or furnace cycles on and off 
too seldom or too frequently and you have 
a mechanical control, try adjusting the 
anticipator — usually a flat metal pointer on 
a scale. If heat starts and stops too often, 
move the anticipator a smidge higher. If it 
starts and stops too seldom, adjust it a tad 
lower. Wait a few hours to see if the adjust-
ment was enough.
 ✓ You need new batteries. Electronic ther-
mostats with digital readouts and keypads 
rarely fail. Just put in new batteries when 
the low-power light comes on.
With simple maintenance and light cleaning, 
thermostats, whether electronic or mechani-
cal, will function best and as they should — for 
comfort.
Today’s programmable thermostats are so 
“smart” that they will not only make your home 
more comfortable, but conserve energy and 
save money, too. How, you ask? Simple. You can 
program a smart thermostat to turn the heat-
ing system on just before you get out of bed in 
the morning, turn off about the time everyone 
leaves the home, turn on again just in time to 
have the home toasty for your return after a 
long day, and finally turn off just about the time 
you snuggle into bed. Some electronic models 
can be programmed day to day or for weekdays 
versus weekends, or to raise and lower the 
temperature several times a day. What’s more, 
as technology improves, the product becomes 
more affordable. Programmable thermostats 
range in price from $35 to more than $100, 
depending on features. They can be installed 
by most do-it-yourselfers and come complete 
with step-by-step instructions for easy instal-
lation. Some manufacturers even offer toll-free 
installation help lines that will walk you through 
the installation process. Yippee!

204
Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
 
A wall-mounted mechanical exhaust fan is another great means of improving 
air circulation in a basement. Keep in mind that an exhaust fan will create 
negative pressure in a basement where there is no air intake, so you’ll want to 
be sure to have a window or a screened vent (such as a foundation vent) to 
provide for air intake.
 
Negative pressure can starve your furnace or gas-fired water heater of neces-
sary oxygen for efficient combustion. In addition, negative pressure can pre-
vent toxic gases from properly exhausting through vent flues.
Big or Small, an Air Conditioner 
Cools Y’all
When it comes to air conditioning (AC), people don’t care how it works, just 
that it works. It’s all about being cool. Fortunately for sweat-averse folks, AC 
technology has advanced tremendously in recent years. And, even better, 
the energy efficiency of central-AC equipment had improved along with it. In 
fact, if you have an AC unit that is more than 10 or 12 years old, today’s ultra-
energy-efficient units can cut your cooling costs in half.
The efficiency of window units has improved a great deal, too, as has the 
performance of AC/heat-pump units. Even the old-style evaporation systems 
(sometimes called swamp coolers) have received an infusion of advanced 
technology.
With all this new technology, are there any maintenance tasks a do-it-your-
selfer can do? Not very many.
Central air-conditioning systems
Maintenance-wise, you can take care of a central-air system just by chang-
ing the furnace filters monthly, and periodically hosing off the fins of the 
exterior condensing unit (that’s the large cube that sits outside in a flower 
bed and contains a fan that blows hot air) to remove dust and debris. The 
most important thing you can do is call a licensed heating/cooling contractor 
every spring for a thorough inspection and comprehensive maintenance.
Regular maintenance aside, if you’re getting to know your serviceman a little 
too well because of frequent and repeated repairs, it’s time to replace your 

205
 Chapter 10: Heating, Ventilating, and Air-Conditioning Systems
system. According to Energy Star, a government-backed program that helps 
businesses and individuals protect the environment through energy efficiency, 
if your air-conditioning system is ten years old or older, you should replace it 
with a new, significantly more energy-efficient Energy Star–rated model.
Replacing a central air-conditioning system is not a do-it-yourself project. 
Contact a qualified heating and air-conditioning contractor who will be able 
to discuss the various decisions you have to make when purchasing and 
installing a new system.
Among these considerations is size. In the past, the general rule for sizing 
a central air-conditioning system was 1 ton of air-conditioning capacity for 
every 500 square feet of living area. Today, sizing an air-conditioning system 
takes into consideration many factors and is far more complex.
 
When it comes to central air-conditioning, bigger isn’t necessarily better. 
An oversized unit will operate with short run times, not allowing the unit to 
reach efficient operation or deliver even temperatures throughout the home. 
Another disadvantage to an oversized unit is that it won’t run long enough to 
adequately remove excess humidity. What’s more, an oversized unit will expe-
rience increased operating costs. Conversely, an undersized system will run 
much longer than it should, and will likely never do an adequate job of cooling 
your home.
Studies show that summertime operation at 78 degrees and 30 percent rela-
tive humidity provides the same level of occupant comfort as 74 degrees and 
70 percent relative humidity. This lower humidity level will provide increased 
comfort, lower utility bills, and less risk of health issues associated with high 
humidity.
To reduce wasted energy, the U.S. Department of Energy has established 
minimum efficiency standards for air conditioners. Every unit is given an effi-
ciency rating, called a seasonal energy-efficiency rating (SEER). The higher the 
SEER number, the more efficient the unit, and the lower the cost to provide a 
given amount of cooling. The minimum SEER for a new central air conditioner 
is 13. Ultra-efficient models have a SEER of 15 to 18. (Note: Window AC units 
are exempt from the SEER requirements — their rating is around 10.)
 
Don’t be confused by terminology. Ignore marketing words like high-efficiency, 
super-high-efficiency, and ultra-high-efficiency, and focus on the SEER number.
 
If your air conditioner seems dead or if it’s blowing only hot air, check the cir-
cuit breakers before you call for service. Nothing makes you feel more stupid 
than paying a serviceman $75 to flip the breaker back on or replace the fuse.

Part III: Key Systems: Plumbing and HVAC 
Window air-conditioner units
As with a central AC system, there’s not much you have to do to maintain a 
window air-conditioning unit:
 
✓ Clean the filter on the interior face every month. Unplug the unit. Pull 
off the front panel and remove the filter, or slide the filter out the side. 
Then wash the filter gently in mild detergent, rinse, and dry.
 
✓ Clean the condenser coil fins on the exterior face at least once a year. 
Gently vacuum or brush the fins and then straighten any bent fins with 
a comb.
 
Never remove the cover and clean inside the unit. You could get a shock (even 
when it’s unplugged), and all you can do is bend or break something. If you 
goof up something inside, you won’t have a window unit anymore; you’ll have 
an ugly doorstop.
 
Got a 10-year-old window air conditioner? Throw it out! A new unit will be 25 
percent to 50 percent more energy efficient. But don’t buy just any air condi-
tioner; get one that works efficiently — one with an Energy Star label, one that 
does all it can to help you keep your electric bill in check. Also, you’ll want to
 
✓ Buy the right capacity unit. Measure the room you want to cool and 
bring the width, length, and height measurements to the store so that 
the salesperson can help you choose a unit that’s efficient for the space.
 
✓ Get a unit with an energy-saving thermostat that cycles the unit on 
and off.
 
✓ Make sure you get a three-speed fan (high to cool the room quickly 
and medium or low to maintain the temperature).
 
✓ Choose a model with a timer to turn the unit on before you get home.

I
t doesn’t take much to mess up a wall or ceiling. And as they say, stuff 
happens: A missing door bumper lets the knob punch a nice round hole. 
A shift in the foundation results in a 5-foot hairline crack. A heavy dresser 
leaves dozens of dents as it’s carried down the hallway. A little kid’s crayon 
makes unpaintable purple squiggles. An area of plaster ceiling loses its grip 
and sags.
You get the picture: Life is hard on walls and ceilings. Luckily, most mainte-
nance to these surfaces is well within your reach.
Cleaning Walls and Ceilings
You may not realize it, but everything in your kitchen is covered with a thin 
coating of grease and gummy dust. And your bathroom walls have their own 
coating of gunk, including hairspray, cleaning products, and stuck-on dust. 
And don’t forget crayon marks on bedroom walls and handprints and ugly 
smudges galore everywhere else.
You can wipe away fingerprints, crayon, pen marks, dirt, and dust from walls, 
trim, and doors with almost any household cleaner and a damp cloth. If your 
house is relatively new, make a bucket of soapy water and wipe the walls and 
ceiling with a damp sponge. If your house is older, you need something that 
cuts through the accumulated crud: a synthetic TSP solution, like Spic And 
Span. (Short for trisodium phosphate, TSP removes greasy dirt like nothing 
else.) Mix up a bucketful, wipe down the walls and ceiling, and then rinse 
thoroughly with clean water.

Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
Morris’s wife, Carol, recommends a sponge mop for cleaning both smooth 
and textured ceilings (not the popcorn ones). The foam-rubber sponge holds 
up best. She cautions that head protection is a must. An old bath towel can 
be used to dry the ceiling. Remember: Mildew loves a wet surface. Get it dry 
right away! Carol loves 409, but she does use TSP in extreme cases.
 
TSP (also known as liquid sandpaper) etches paint. It will eventually dull a 
glossy finish. A TSP cleaning should be performed only when nothing else 
works or when you intend to prepare a wall for painting. But be careful: If 
you’re planning to paint your wall after cleaning with TSP, a leftover film pre-
vents proper paint adhesion, so be sure to rinse the area thoroughly with 
fresh water.
Dealing with Drywall
Chances are, the walls and ceilings of your home are made of drywall (also 
referred to as wallboard, gypsum board, or sheetrock). Drywall is both easy 
to damage and easy to repair.
Drywall gets two kinds of damage: gouges and hairline cracks. Gouges are 
usually caused by accident — by you, an angry spouse, a guest, or the previ-
ous owner. Hairline cracks are usually caused by movement in the foundation 
or framing of the house, which is nobody’s fault. The frame of your house 
expands and contracts with the seasons, as temperature and humidity levels 
change.
Repairing small cracks
Got a small crack? Fill it with a flexible silicone caulk. The silicone flexes as 
the crack widens and narrows with normal house movement. (Silicone caulk-
ing also works for little nail holes.) Caulking is easy — just follow these steps:
 
1. Buy a fresh tube of silicone caulking (the paintable kind).
 
 The old tube in the basement has probably dried out, making it useless.
 
2. Use a caulking gun to spread a thin bead of the caulk into the crack.
 
3. Wipe the excess from around the crack with rubbing alcohol.
 
4. Coat the repair with primer.
 
 Don’t skip this step or you’ll end up with a permanently goofy-looking, 
non-matching area.
 
5. Repaint, as necessary.

211
 Chapter 11: Walls and Ceilings
 
Don’t fill a crack with drywall joint compound or spackle. Spackle’s brittle-
ness allows the crack to come back year after year, until you take a hammer 
and pound a dozen frustration holes in the wall. Or maybe that’s just how we 
would handle it.
Filling bigger cracks
Bigger cracks require a different kind of maintenance. Here’s what you need:
 
✓ 6-inch taping knife
 
✓ 10- or 12-inch taping knife
 
✓ 1 square piece of plywood or a plastic mud pan
 
✓ Drywall joint compound
 
✓ Drywall tape (paper or fiberglass)
 
✓ 220-grit sanding mesh and a drywaller’s sanding block
Here’s how to stop that crack dead in its tracks:
 
1. Clean out the crack so there are no loose “crumbs.”
 
2. Put a blob of compound on the plywood or mud pan.
 
 This step makes it easy to load compound onto the knife.
 
3. Apply the tape to the wall, following the instructions that are appli-
cable to the type of tape you’re using:
 
• Paper tape: Use the 6-inch taping knife to apply a light coat of the 
joint compound, about 1/8 inch thick, directly to the crack; imme-
diately cover the compound with the tape, being sure to center 
the tape over the crack; and then use the knife to lightly wipe the 
tape into the compound and squeegee away any compound that 
squishes out. The joint compound acts as an adhesive to hold the 
tape to the wall. Do your best to prevent ripples and bumps by 
using smooth, even pressure as you squeegee. You can sand any 
mistakes later, but sanding is a lot of work.
 
• Fiberglass tape: Apply the fiberglass tape directly to the crack. (It 
has a self-stick backing.)
 
 Fiberglass tape is a little thicker than paper tape, so it’s more difficult to 
make a completely invisible repair. We prefer the tried-and-true paper tape, 
and we think you’ll get better results with it. But some people are rebels.
 
 If the crack is really crooked, cut the tape in short lengths so that you 
can follow the line as closely as possible.

212
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
 
4. Apply a thin coat of compound over the tape and smooth it with the 
6-inch taping knife, making sure to feather the edges.
 
 Let the patch dry completely (usually overnight).
 
5. Apply a second, smoothing coat using the 10- to 12-inch taping knife, 
again making sure to feather the edges.
 
 Let the second coat dry completely.
 
6. Apply a third (and, with luck, final) coat using the 10- to 12-inch 
taping knife, again making sure to feather the edges.
 
 Let the third coat dry completely.
 
7. Sand the patch until smooth.
 
8. Apply a coat of good-quality primer.
 
9. Paint to match.
Filling holes like a pro
Joint compound alone is not enough to fill any hole larger than a quarter. 
You’ve got to put something into the hole or onto it and then use compound 
to make it smooth and invisible.
Holes that are too large to fill with compound, but are no more than 4 or 5 
inches across, can be patched with a precut stick-on patch and some joint 
compound. Use a peel-and-stick patch; made of stiff metal mesh, you can 
place these patches over the hole and cover them with two or three coats (or 
more) of compound. Here’s how:
 
1. Cover the hole with a stick-on patch.
 
 Use scissors to trim the patch so that it’s about an inch larger than the hole.
 
2. Smear and then smooth the compound over the entire area, feather-
ing the edges.
 
 Here, less is more. A thin layer of compound at a time is the big secret. A 
thick layer is difficult to sand, shows up on the wall as a bump, and may 
develop cracks.
 
3. Let the compound dry completely, and then sand it lightly.
 
4. Smooth a second layer of compound over the patch, and let it dry 
completely.
 
 Finish the project with a third coat of compound and allow it to dry 
completely. A fourth coat or “touch-up” coat may be required for an 
invisible patch.
 
5. Sand, prime, and paint.

213
 Chapter 11: Walls and Ceilings
Holes that are too big for a metal patch require a slightly different technique. 
For these holes, you have to make a patch using a chunk of drywall. The easi-
est way to make this kind of repair is to use drywall clips. These little metal 
wonders straddle the edge of the hole and create a series of little “shelves” 
along the back edge of the hole, providing screw-backing for a cut-to-fit patch. 
Follow these steps:
 
1. From a piece of scrap drywall, cut a square or rectangular patch large 
enough to completely cover the hole.
 
2. Hold the patch over the hole and trace its outline with a pencil.
 
3. Use a utility knife or drywall saw to cut away everything inside the 
penciled outline.
 
 Watch out for wires and pipes!
 
4. Install drywall clips on all sides of the hole (no more than 8 inches 
apart), and secure them using the screws provided with the clips.
 
5. Insert the patch into the hole, and drive screws through the patch into 
the clips.
 
6. Snap off the temporary tabs of the clips (the ones that extend beyond 
the face of the wall).
 
7. To complete the patch, follow the finishing process for a smaller patch 
(see the “Repairing small cracks” section, earlier in this chapter).
 
 With larger patches the only difference is that you have to apply the 
joint tape on all four joints of the patch (top, bottom, and sides).
Re-creating texture
If your walls have a textured surface, you need 
to re-create that texture on the patched area. 
Here’s how:
 ✓ For a swirly finish: Place blobs of com-
pound evenly throughout the patched area, 
and then swirl (what did you expect?) a 
damp sponge through the blobs until the 
area is evenly covered. Try to duplicate the 
swirls on the rest of the wall. You can use 
almost any implement that will duplicate the 
original pattern (a drywall knife, a paint-
brush, a roller).
 ✓ For a flattened-bumps finish: Use spray 
texture in a can. Simply spray on the tex-
ture, and then use one of several spray-tip 
adjustments to apply a light, medium, or 
heavy pattern. Wait a few minutes and use 
a drywall knife to slightly flatten the bumps. 
You can also use a portable pump for larger 
areas. Don’t rush — wiping the bumps 
when they’re too wet will completely flat-
ten them, and you’ll have a mess.
 ✓ For a bumpy finish: Follow the procedure 
for the flattened-bumps finish, but omit the 
flattening step.
Practice your texturing technique on a scrap 
piece of cardboard, plywood, or drywall. You 
only get one whack at the real thing.

214
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
 
If you can’t find drywall clips, there’s another way to fix a cantaloupe-size 
cavity. Just follow the preceding steps, but instead of using clips, simply use 
a piece of wood. Use the same principal as the clip method; this time, though, 
attach a narrow strip of wood to the back of the hole in the wallboard at each 
side of the opening (two sides will do). Drive screws through the existing dry-
wall and into the wood strip to create the needed backing. Half the plywood is 
held behind the drywall while the other half is exposed, acting as backing for 
the patch.
Tackling truss uplift
If your home has been plagued by constant cracks at several joints where the 
walls and ceiling meet, then you may have more than a simple drywall-patch-
ing problem. You may have truss uplift. Truss uplift results when moisture 
content differences exist between the upper (rafter) and lower (ceiling joist) 
cords of wood trusses (see Figure 11-1).

Where the ceiling and
walls meet, cracks form

215
 Chapter 11: Walls and Ceilings
Moisture content differences are typical when one cord is cold and the other 
cord is warm. For example, the bottom cord of a truss surrounded by a well-
insulated attic will be warmer than its cold rafter counterpart. The expansion 
of the top cord of a truss exerts an inward force on the bottom cord, which 
causes it to bow upward and lift away from the tops of interior partitions 
(hence, the term truss uplift).
There is no surefire means of preventing truss uplift. You can, however, elimi-
nate the cracks at the ceiling-to-wall connection once and for all by remov-
ing all the ceiling drywall fasteners within 18 inches of the adjacent interior 
partition from each of the trusses. Simply use a wood block and hammer 
from within the attic to tap the ceiling wallboard away from the bottom cord 
of each truss — first on one side and then on the other — until the drywall is 
freed from its fasteners in that first 18 inches. With the wallboard free of the 
fasteners and “floating,” you can repair the ceiling-to-wall crack like any wall-
board crack (see “Filling bigger cracks,” earlier in this chapter).
 
If for some reason the problem continues — even on a limited basis — we sug-
gest installing a crown mold that is fastened only to the walls and not to the 
ceiling. Thus, movement can still occur, but the decorative trim conceals any 
seasonal cracks.
Putting the stop on nail pops
Nail pops are nail-head bumps or crescent-shaped cracks in the wall or ceil-
ing. They occur when nails work loose, literally popping out through the sur-
face of the drywall. Unfortunately, they happen for as long as you own your 
home. If you get a nail pop, you need to fix it.
 
You can find nail pops (and other defects) by shining a bright light at a shal-
low angle to the wall. Set a floor lamp with a 100-watt bulb about a foot from 
the wall in question, and remove the lampshade. Voilà! You’ll be amazed at 
how the nail pops pop out at you.
To fix a nail pop, you need the following tools:
 
✓ Hammer
 
✓ Drill or driver
 
✓ Nail set (or large nail)
 
✓ 15/8-inch drywall screws

216
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
 
✓ 15/8-inch drywall nails
 
✓ 6-inch taping knife
 
✓ Drywall joint compound
 
✓ Fine-grit sandpaper
 
✓ Paint
 
✓ Paintbrush
Here’s how you do the repair:
 
1. Drive new drywall screws into the wall stud or ceiling joist at least 
2 inches away from, and on either side of, the popped fastener.
 
 The screws should pull the drywall tight against the framing, and the 
screw heads should slightly dimple into the drywall. Don’t depend on 
the screws to draw the drywall tightly against the framing. Here you 
must use your free hand to press and hold the drywall firmly against the 
framing, and then install the screws.
 
2. Using the hammer and nail set, drive a new nail immediately adjacent 
to the existing one.
 
 Trying to remove the old nail can cause additional damage; resetting it 
minimizes the work. Try to nail the new nail into the same hole as the 
old one. Part of the head of the new nail will overlap the head of the old 
nail. Use the nail set to slightly recess the new nail (about @@bf1/16 inch). 
The head of the new nail, combined with the adjacent screws, will pre-
vent the old nail from slipping out again.
 
3. With the 6-inch taping knife, apply a smooth, flat coat of compound 
over the dimpled heads of the new fasteners and the hole left by the 
old nail.
 
 Let the compound dry completely.
 
4. Lightly sand the patch with the fine-grit sandpaper.
 
5. With the 6-inch taping knife, apply a second coat of compound.
 
6. Let the compound dry, and then lightly sand it again.
 
7. Prime and paint.
Plaster: More Trouble 
than You May Want
Older houses have plaster walls and ceilings with wood lath for a base. These 
thin strips of wood were installed on the wall framing with gaps between 

217
 Chapter 11: Walls and Ceilings
them, which the original plaster then filled, creating “keys” that hold the plas-
ter in place.
If your plaster walls are in good condition, you can fix cracks and holes using 
patching plaster. But if your walls or ceilings are sagging and have big holes, 
you’ve got a big job ahead of you.
Fixing small cracks and holes
Cracks and tiny holes in plaster are slightly more difficult to patch than 
wallboard — not because the damaged area is harder to fill, but because the sur-
face texture requires a more finite match. Refer to the “Repairing small cracks” 
section, earlier in this chapter, and take a little extra time to match the finish.
The major task in matching a plaster finish is to make sure to remove all 
excess caulk surrounding the crack and to apply a thick coat of texturing 
sand to the surface of the fresh caulking. You’ll find small boxes of textur-
ing sand in the paint and patching section of your hardware store or home 
center. Start by putting on protective goggles. Then simply place a generous 
amount of texturing sand in the cupped palm of your hand and blow across it 
and onto the fresh caulk. The sand will adhere to the caulk and help disguise 
the crack. Finish the job by priming and painting the patch after the caulk has 
had a chance to set up over night.
Dealing with sagging and 
other big problems
As plaster ages, as leaks occur, and as the house shifts, the ceiling plaster 
can loosen and sag. Finding a sag is easy. You can confirm your diagnosis by 
pressing against suspect areas with the flat of your hand. If the plaster feels 
spongy or gives, a repair is in order.
 
If a sagging ceiling area is not fixed, it can suddenly let go, with a huge poten-
tial for damage and personal injury. Don’t wait for this to happen.
If the sagging is only slight, or covering a small area, you can reattach the 
plaster to the lath using long drywall screws fitted with plaster washers (thin 
metal disks through which drywall screws are threaded and then driven 
through the plaster into ceiling joists, wall studs, or lath). The screw/washer 
duo pulls the loose plaster tight against the framing, fixing the sag and stabi-
lizing the area. The tricky thing is that you can’t just wail away with the drill 
or driver. You’ve got to go slowly, tightening each screw/washer a little bit at 
a time, all the while pressing firmly against the plaster with your free hand so 
that it’s gradually and evenly pulled snugly to the framing.

218
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
If the sagging is severe (more than 1 inch away from the lath), or if the sag 
covers a large area, the best solution is to pull down the old plaster and 
replaster, or cover it with drywall. Neither is an easy do-it-yourself project.
If your plaster is sagging in one place, it’ll probably sag in ten other spots 
sooner or later. Crumbling plaster tends to become a chronic problem. Why? 
Your plaster simply may have reached the end of its useful life. Or maybe the 
original plasterers were learning on the job (not good!), you’ve got hidden 
water damage or rot (trouble!), or your foundation is unstable (big trouble!).
 
Whatever the underlying cause, sags and serious cracks are problems that will 
probably keep cropping up. You could keep repairing them, but plastering is a 
difficult job best done by highly skilled, expensive professionals. Instead, you 
probably need to think about proactively covering or replacing your slowly 
crumbling plaster with a fresh layer of drywall. If you elect to do that, how-
ever, it may take some time to get used to having nice straight walls, flat ceil-
ings, and 90-degree corners.
Interior Painting: Doing the Job Right
Nothing freshens things up like a new coat of paint. But, like anything, 
there’s a right way and a wrong way to do the job. In this section, we walk 
you through the steps to painting. Follow our advice, and you’re sure to be 
pleased with the results.
Preparing to paint
You’ve bought your paint, you’ve got new brushes and rollers, you’ve spread 
out the dropcloths, and you’ve opened up the stepladder. You’re ready to paint.
Whoa! Stop right there, Mr. or Ms. Inabighurry. You’ve forgotten the most 
important thing: surface preparation. The real secret to a beautiful, long-
lasting paint job is getting the walls and ceiling really clean and perfectly 
smooth. The following tasks don’t take that much time, but they can make 
the difference between a long-lasting paint job and one that you have to redo 
long before you’re ready:
 
1. Prepare the room.
 
 Make sure to:
 
• Remove lamps, irreplaceable knickknacks, and as much furniture as 
you can, and then push whatever is left to the middle of the room.
 
• Remove anything attached to the walls, including pictures, window 
treatments, and switch and outlet plates.

219
 Chapter 11: Walls and Ceilings
 
• Loosen ceiling light fixtures and wrap them in plastic trash bags.
 
• Take off all the window and door hardware.
 
• Cover every inch of everything — floor, furniture, and radiators — 
with canvas or heavy-plastic dropcloths.
 
2. Clean the surface (see the “Cleaning Walls and Ceilings” section, ear-
lier in this chapter, for details).
 
 If you have mildew on a wall, you need to kill it and cover the remaining 
stain with a stain sealer primer made to hide stains. (See Chapter 20 for 
more information on killing mildew.)
 
3. Prepare the surface.
 
 To prepare the surface, you need to:
 
• Fill nail holes, cracks, and other imperfections with patching 
compound.
 
• Scrape any loose or flaking paint on windows, sills, and woodwork. 
(See the nearby sidebar, “Removing paint from woodwork,” for 
more information.)
 
• Sand patches and any bare areas on windows, sills, and woodwork.
 
• Lightly sand or use a deglosser to knock down the shine on glossy 
trim. A deglosser is essentially liquid sandpaper. It etches the exist-
ing finish that will help the new paint stick.
 
• Lightly sand walls if they’re uneven, brush-marked, or bumpy.
 
• Fill gaps between the trim and the walls (especially along the base-
boards and door trim) with caulk.
 
4. Clean again.
 
 Vacuum the room to remove sanding dust and paint flakes (don’t forget 
to do the windowsills and trim). Then wipe down everything with a tack 
cloth or barely damp rag. (A tack cloth is a piece of cloth that is coated 
in a sticky [tacky] substance so that dust and particles stick to it.)
 
5. Mask the windows.
 
 Use wax paper or a layer of thin plastic taped to the windows to prevent 
paint splatters on the glass.
  
 Use painter’s tape when masking for paint prep. It contains less adhe-
sive, which means it will be easier to remove and will cause less poten-
tial damage when peeled off. Although it’s often referred to as blue 
painter’s tape, it’s available in a host of colors with varying degrees of 
adhesive designed to last for varying amounts of time.
Now you’re ready to gather your supplies.

220
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
Gathering your paint and 
painting supplies
After you’ve scraped, sanded, filled holes, sanded again, and cleaned, the 
preparation phase is complete and painting can begin, right? Not quite yet. 
Not until you gather your paint and painting supplies.
Selecting a primer
Primer creates a stronger bond between the paint and the wall, helps resist 
attack by moisture, fills small cracks, and smoothes and seals the surface so 
that finish coats are more uniform and lustrous, as well as longer lasting.
When you patch a spot or scrape down to bare wood, you create a rough, 
porous area that absorbs more paint than the area around it, creating uneven 
gloss and an area that is a slightly different in color than the surrounding 
area. Primer seals the area so this doesn’t happen. A stain-killing primer also 
keeps mysterious dark marks, water stains, crayon, marker, and pen from 
bleeding through to the final finish.
 
If you can, use the same brand of primer and paint. Manufacturers formulate 
their paints and primers so that they work well together. In general, oil-based 
primers are the best (you can apply latex paint over them). The label on the 
paint will likely designate the type of primer to use. If you’re still not sure, ask 
one of the experts at the paint store to help you select a primer.
Removing paint from woodwork
For most woodwork, a putty knife and sand-
paper remove loose flakes. But if your wood-
work has 37 layers on it, try a scraper. Use a 
scraper designed specifically for moldings. If 
that doesn’t work well, or if you’re a little low on 
elbow grease, try an electric heat gun or chemi-
cal stripper. Heat guns soften the paint so that it 
can be scraped away. Strippers also soften the 
paint for easier scraping. Don’t even think about 
using a propane torch as you would outside.
Scraping, sanding, or using a heat gun is not an 
option if the paint contains lead. Be safe, not 
sorry. Your local hardware store or home center 
carries a special test kit that will tell you if lead 
exists. The test takes only minutes, and you’re 
always better off taking the time to check.
If your paint contains lead, and it’s not peel-
ing or flaking, your best bet is to simply give it 
a TSP wash and apply a fresh coat of primer 
and finish. If the paint is in anything but pristine 
condition, or if you simply want it out of your 
home, we suggest that you hire a professional 
lead-paint abatement contractor to carefully 
remove the paint.

221
 Chapter 11: Walls and Ceilings
Selecting a paint
Latex paints are the top choice for walls and ceilings. Don’t let anyone tell 
you differently. They dry quickly and clean up with soap and water.
Sure, if latex paints aren’t thin enough and wet enough to begin with, they 
can dry so quickly that brush marks and lap marks (also called dry edge, 
where a line left by the edge of the roller is visible) are hard to avoid. And, 
yeah, they don’t stand up to scrapes and clunks as well as oil-based paints 
do. But the pluses far outweigh the minuses, particularly when you consider 
that latex paints contain no toxic solvents.
 
Check out Mythic Paint (www.mythicpaint.com). This company is the first 
to offer a completely 0 percent toxic latex paint — no toxic solvents and no 
toxic components.
Oil-based paints, on the other hand, are still the best choice for doors and 
trim. They dry slowly, giving brushstrokes time to disappear. They also dry 
to a very hard, durable finish. They offer greater moisture resistance, which 
makes them perfect for the walls and ceilings of damp areas such as the 
kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room. However, cleanup requires solvents, 
and as oil-based paints dry, they release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) 
into the air. (For the sake of the environment, when purchasing oil-based 
paint, be sure to look for a low-VOC product. Low-VOC paints contain fewer 
toxic chemicals.)
 
Buy the highest-quality paint you can afford — unless you like to paint. If you 
use poor-quality paint, you’ll probably need to apply more than two coats — 
plus, you get to paint again in just a few years. Why not do the job right the 
first time?
 
Want to know just how good your paint really is? Try this test: First, have the 
can of paint shaken really well at a paint store. (Paint stores have machines 
for this.) Next, open the can and dip the tip of your index finger into the well-
blended liquid. Finally, rub your index finger against your thumb. If the paint 
feels gritty, it contains too much filler and is of poor quality. A high-quality 
paint will feel silky and smooth.
How much paint should you buy? Measure the area (square footage) of your 
walls and ceiling, look on the can of paint to see how many square feet it can 
cover, and divide your room square footage by that amount. You can do the 
same thing for the trim.
 
When buying paint, err on the high side. You can always use the extra for 
touchups. Erring on the low side may bring you back to the store for the same 
color mixed on a different date. Can you spell mismatch?

Getting the right painting tools
When you’re getting ready to paint, you need the following supplies:
 
✓ A trim brush: A 2-inch brush for painting door trim and other wide 
moldings.
 
✓ A sash brush: A 11/2-inch angled brush made for detail painting of win-
dows and narrow trim pieces.
 
✓ A roller: A fabric covered hollow cylinder (typically 9 inches long) that 
fits over a metal roller frame. You use a roller when you want to paint 
a large area, like a wall; you use paintbrushes for the detail work. The 
nap (length of the fabric) varies depending upon the desired finish. In 
general, use a short nap for smooth surfaces and a long nap for rough 
surfaces.
When buying a paintbrush, consider the following:
 
✓ The handle should feel good in your hand. You’re going to be holding it 
for a while.
 
✓ The metal piece that holds the bristles should be securely attached.
 
✓ The bristles should fan out, not separate, when you press them against 
your palm.
 
✓ The bristles should be smooth, straight, and have tiny split ends.
 
✓ The bristles should stay attached when you lightly tug on them.
 
✓ The brush should be appropriate for the kind of paint and surface 
that you want to paint. For example, thick fluffy rollers are for rough 
surfaces, and tight-nap rollers are for smooth surfaces. The kind of roller 
you need also depends on the paint and surface in question. Ask a sales 
assistant for help.
 
Don’t even think about using a sprayer to paint indoors. The same goes for 
power rollers. You’ll make a big mess.
You may have heard some buzz about heat-reflective paint. It may be easy 
enough to warm up to in a laboratory, and we’ve witnessed impressive tests 
under controlled conditions, but we aren’t privy to any government-approved 
or -recommended household uses. As far as we’re concerned, the jury is still 
out on this one.
Painting made easy
You’ve bought the right paint. You’ve got good brushes and rollers. The room 
is thoroughly prepped. Everything is covered up. It’s time to actually paint.

223
 Chapter 11: Walls and Ceilings
A good paint job consists of three basic steps: priming, applying a first coat 
of finish paint, and applying a second coat of finish paint.
 
Before you do anything, stir the paint thoroughly. Paint looks better and lasts 
longer if all its components are mixed well from the start. Three minutes is a 
good amount of stirring time.
Always paint a room from top to bottom. The job will go faster — and turn 
out better — if you follow this sequence:
 
1. Paint the ceiling, using a trim brush and a roller.
 
 Using the trim brush, paint a 2- to 4-inch-wide strip that feathers out 
toward the middle of the room. Then paint the rest of the ceiling immedi-
ately with a roller, starting in a corner and painting across the narrowest 
dimension of the room.
 
2. Starting when the ceiling is dry, paint the walls with a trim brush and 
roller.
 
 Do one wall at a time. With a trim brush, cut in where the walls meet the 
ceiling, around the doors and windows, and along the baseboards. Use a 
roller for the rest.
 
3. Paint the windows, using an angular sash brush, and, if you prefer, a 
smaller brush for the dividers.
 
4. Paint the doors, using a trim brush.
 
 Work quickly but carefully. Paint all the edges, but not the hinges.
 
5. Using a sash brush, paint the door and window trim — edges first and 
then the face.
 
6. Paint the baseboards, using a sash brush.
 
 Protect the floor or carpet with painter’s tape or a paint shield.
 
Here are a few more helpful hints to getting a great-looking paint job:
 
✓ Work with a partner if you can. One of you can cut in the edges, and 
the other can follow along with the roller!
 
✓ Use plenty of paint. Most do-it-yourselfers try to make a brush full or 
roller full go too far. Hey, it ain’t champagne! If you skimp on the paint, 
you’ll end up with a room that looks yucky.
 
✓ Two thin, wet coats of paint always flow better and, thus, dry smoother 
than one thick, dry coat. Adding a bit of water to latex paint or thinner 
to oil-based paint will cause the paint to be thinner and wetter.
 
Adding a teaspoon of vanilla extract to a gallon of latex paint can make the 
drying process a sweeter-smelling experience. You can also try a fragrance 
available at the paint store.

224
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
Cleaning up right, storing smart
Latex paint cleans up with water. Wash the brush under warm water, making 
sure to work any paint out of the base of the bristles and the ferrule (the 
metal band). Shake or snap the brush to get the water out, and hang it up 
to dry, bristles down. During short breaks — lunch, siesta, poker game — 
cover your paintbrushes and equipment with plastic wrap to keep them from 
drying out.
To clean up oil-based paint or primer, use paint thinner. Fill an old coffee can 
with enough thinner to cover the bristles and ferrule and slosh the brush 
around, allowing the thinner to dissolve the paint. Remove the brush from 
the thinner and tap the ferrule firmly against the edge of a paint bucket 
(bristles pointing toward the inside of the bucket) to remove the thinned 
paint. Repeat this process until the brush is clean. It’s a messy, stinky job. 
Luckily, you only need to clean your brushes once at the end of the job. When 
you stop for the day, wrap the brushes in plastic wrap and store them in the 
fridge overnight, and they’ll be ready to go (once warmed to room tempera-
ture) when you start again.
To store paint (whether latex or oil-based), place a sheet of plastic wrap over 
the mouth of the can, and then put on the lid. Tap the lid into place snugly 
(use a rubber mallet or a hammer and a small piece of wood). Store the can 
upside-down. Your paint will be usable for years, because you’ve created an 
airtight seal.
Making Paneling Look like New
Most houses more than 25 years old have at least one room with paneling. 
Believe it or not, paneling was very chic at one time, and it still has its place 
in Dad’s den, the basement rec room, and rustic homes. There are three 
kinds of paneling — solid wood planks, plywood sheets, and faux-finished 
hardboard.
Cleaning and oiling paneling
If you have solid wood or plywood on the wall, you can do a number of things 
to make it look like new. Cleaning is the easiest and most effective way to 
brighten the finish:

225
 Chapter 11: Walls and Ceilings
 
1. Mix equal parts of white vinegar, turpentine, and boiled linseed oil in 
a small container.
 
 Furniture polish won’t do the job — you need something stronger.
 
2. While wearing rubber gloves, dip a soft, clean, colorless cloth into the 
solution, wipe it on the paneling, and rub it in.
 
3. Scrub the cleaner and moisturizer into the surface until it starts to 
evaporate.
 
4. Finish up by wiping off the excess with a dry cloth.
 
 You’ll be amazed by the results.
 
If your wood walls are just dry, bring them back to life by wiping on lemon oil. 
Lemon oil is an excellent cleaner as well.
Correcting surface imperfections
To patch a small hole or surface imperfection, use wood dough, and then 
camouflage the repair with a color-match touch-up stick or, if you’re feeling 
artsy, by applying a faux finish.
 
Faux finishing is literally an art. If it’s done well, faux finishing makes the 
painted surface look exactly like the existing wood surface. You can’t tell the 
area of the repair from the surrounding texture, color, or grain pattern. Faux 
finishing is a job for experts, though, and it’s expensive. If the paneling is beau-
tiful and isn’t available anymore, a faux finish could be the least-expensive 
repair alternative.
If you’re tired of the dark, woody look that paneling provides, but you like the 
texture of real wood, you can paint it. First, wash the surface with a solution 
of TSP (see the “Cleaning Walls and Ceilings” section, earlier in this chapter). 
When the surface is dry, prime it with an oil-based stain-killer primer. If you 
want to eliminate the grooves between the boards, fill them with vinyl spack-
ling compound, sand, and prime. Finish the job with a good-quality latex paint.
Wondering about Wallpaper
Time is not kind to wallpaper: The edges peel and buckle, the adhesive gets 
tired and crumbles, bubbles develop, and the wear and tear of normal life 

226
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
starts to take a visible toll. Oh, and don’t forget wallpaper patterns that become 
outrageously outdated. If replacement is in order, we can tell you how to easily 
remove what you have. But that doesn’t mean that you have to rip it down. If 
it’s still looking good and in style, we can help you repair everything else.
Removing wallpaper
If you’ve chosen to replace your wallpaper, you need to purchase a perfora-
tion tool (you can find these in the paint and wallpaper section of your hard-
ware store, home center, or paint store) and rent a wallpaper steamer. After 
you have these two tools, removal is a breeze:
 
1. Use the perforation tool to puncture thousands (yes, thousands) of 
tiny holes into the surface of the wallpaper.
 
 The perforations allow the steam to penetrate to the adhesive.
 
2. Use the steamer to liquefy the adhesive, working from the top down.
 
 Warm, liquefied adhesive flows downward and causes the lower portion 
of the paper to release more quickly.
 
3. Gently pull the paper off the wall.
 
 Don’t be in a hurry. Patience works best with this process.
 
4. Remove the rest of the adhesive that remains on the wall using more 
steam or a liquid enzyme adhesive solvent, which can be found in 
the paint and wallpaper section of your local hardware store, home 
center, or paint store.
 
 For either, you’ll need a large sponge to soak up the softened gooey 
mess that’s left on the wall.
 
If your wallpaper is looking dingy, and it’s washable, sponge it down with a 
solution of mild soap and cold water. Wipe with clean water and then wipe 
dry. (Be sure to test the colorfastness of the wallpaper in some inconspicuous 
corner before you clean it.) Read on to find out how to correct other wallpaper 
problems.
Fixing loose seams and clean tears
Got an edge that’s coming unglued, a seam that’s sticking up, or a clean tear? 
Here’s how to fix it:
 
1. Moisten the damaged area with warm water and carefully lift the soft-
ened wallpaper away from the wall.

227
 Chapter 11: Walls and Ceilings
 
2. Apply a thin coating of lap-and-seam adhesive (available at any wall-
paper store).
 
3. Press the wallpaper back in place, matching it up exactly.
 
4. Roll the edge with a seam roller.
 
 A seam roller is part of a wallpaper installation kit that you can find 
in the paint and wallpaper section of your local hardware store, home 
center, or paint store.
 
5. Sponge off any adhesive that squishes out with a barely damp sponge.
Patching wallpaper
Got a stain or a big, ugly rip in your beautiful wallpaper? If you can find a 
matching leftover scrap, fix it this way:
 
1. Cut a square or rectangular replacement piece that’s a little bit larger 
than the damaged area, making sure to match the pattern exactly; 
then attach the patch to the wall with masking tape.
 
2. Cut through both the patch and the damaged wallpaper simultane-
ously using a utility knife (a process referred to as double cutting).
 
 Don’t make straight cuts. In fact, making a curvy, kidney-shaped cut is 
best, because a curved cut patch is just about impossible to see after it’s 
finished.
 
3. Put the replacement patch somewhere safe; then use a hot-water-
soaked rag to dampen the damaged bit of wallpaper and peel it out.
 
 If necessary, use a perforation tool and a coat of enzyme wallpaper-
adhesive solvent to loosen things up. You can buy this solvent at most 
hardware stores, home centers, or paint and wallpaper stores.
 
4. Apply another coat of solvent, and sponge away any remaining glue 
on the bare spot; then clean the patch area with a clean, damp sponge 
and let dry.
 
5. Soak and soften the patch in a bath of warm water for about three to 
five minutes; when the patch becomes soft and pliable, apply a thin 
coating of adhesive evenly over the entire back.
 
6. Position the patch so that the pattern matches; then carefully smooth 
it down with a clean, damp cloth or a seam roller.
 
7. Sponge off any adhesive that squishes out.
There you go — a fix that’s nearly invisible to all eyes but yours.

Chapter 12
Floors and Interior Doors
In This Chapter
▶ Cleaning and maintaining all types of flooring
▶ Taking care of common door problems
▶ Keeping your door hardware in good working order
I
n this chapter, we take a close up look at what’s underfoot. To get in the 
proper frame of mind, we suggest that you get out of your comfy chair and 
sit on the floor while you read. From that position, you can clearly see — and 
understand — what we’re talking about. While you’re on the floor, peruse the 
surrounding doors. At floor level, you may get a completely different perspec-
tive. On the other hand, simply reading this chapter will give you a new per-
spective on doors and how to maintain them.
Lucky for you, we move quickly and stick to the basics, focusing on the most 
important door and flooring maintenance and repair tasks.
What’s Underfoot? Flooring
Roof replacement may be the single most expensive nonelective repair you 
can make, but flooring is a close second. Although some flooring can be 
reasonably inexpensive, really good, long-lasting flooring costs a bundle — 
making regular maintenance a must.
Vanquishing vinyl trouble
Odds are, you have resilient flooring — sheet vinyl or vinyl tile — somewhere 
in your house. After all, it’s the most popular flooring material for kitchens, 
bathrooms, and laundry rooms. It’s popular because it’s easy to care for. And 
that’s good for you.
This is not to say that a vinyl floor won’t ever have problems. Some problems 
are mainly cosmetic; others are more serious. Vinyl flooring problems are not 

230
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
problems with the material itself but the result of some other problem. If you 
have a series of ridges in your floor, for example, you actually have an uneven 
or swollen underlayment. If your vinyl tile or sheet vinyl is coming up in places, 
you probably have moisture in the subfloor from a leaking pipe, spillage from 
the sink, or condensation from below. As tempting as it may be, you can’t just 
cover up these problems — you have to fix their underlying cause. The follow-
ing sections explain how to remedy these and other common vinyl problems.
 
Vinyl tile and sheet flooring manufactured prior to 1978 may contain asbes-
tos. That’s the year when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency banned 
the use of asbestos in the manufacture of building products. When left alone, 
asbestos flooring poses virtually no risk of exposure. But when disturbed, it 
could release asbestos fibers into the air, which could be hazardous to your 
health. Therefore, be careful not to disturb old tile. If you opt for a new floor, 
you’re almost always better off laying the new floor over the old rather than 
exposing yourself and your family to the risks associated with removal. If 
you’re not sure whether your floor contains asbestos, you can have it tested 
by a licensed testing lab.
Scuff marks
Use an art gum eraser (one of those grayish-tan ones like you used in school) 
or borrow a Pink Pearl eraser from your kid’s school supplies. Just rub the 
mark and — voilà! — it disappears.
For tougher scuffs, use a little paint thinner on a rag to rub the spot clean. 
Be careful not to go nuts with the thinner — you could remove the vinyl’s 
no-wax finish.
After you’ve gotten rid of the scuff marks, stop wearing scuff-makers, like 
cheap plastic-soled shoes, hiking boots, and running shoes, in the house.
Persistent grubbiness
Before you know it, a vinyl floor can acquire a funky gray cast. This comes from 
infrequent or inadequate cleaning. Diligence is the key to avoiding this problem:
 
✓ Vacuum or sweep regularly to remove abrasive dirt and dust.
 
✓ Wipe up spills immediately.
 
✓ Mop regularly with a damp mop and 1 tablespoon of white vinegar in 1 
gallon of warm water (no detergent!).
 
 For the best results, work on a small section at a time and dry it before 
moving on to the next section. If the vinegar solution is left on for an 
extended period and allowed to air-dry, it can dull the finish.
If regular cleaning doesn’t keep the perma-dirt away, use a mop or sponge 
and a solution of warm (not hot) water and a few drops of liquid dish soap. 
Don’t rub too hard. Rinse thoroughly with clean water.

231
 Chapter 12: Floors and Interior Doors
Yellow discoloration
If the problem is a yellow discoloration, you need to remove and reapply 
wax. However, don’t remove the wax more than once a year — the chemicals 
in the remover are hard on the vinyl. When reapplying the wax, be sure to 
choose a product rated for floors as opposed to a paste furniture wax. Floor 
wax provides maximum protection without becoming dangerously slippery. 
Oh, and be sure that the wax that you use is the non-yellowing type — it’ll 
say so on the container.
No-wax vinyl floors require basically the same kind of care as the kind that 
requires waxing. Again, the secret to a long-lasting shine is keeping the floor 
clean. Stay on top of dirt and spills. And when you mop, use only a little white 
vinegar rinse and dry thoroughly.
Eventually, no matter how diligent you are about cleaning, your no-wax floor 
will lose its shine. Then, believe it or not, the best way to make it new-looking 
is to wax it. Use a water-based self-polishing wax. Whenever possible use a 
product recommended by the manufacturer. If you don’t know who the manu-
facturer is, get a recommendation from a reputable flooring contractor in 
your area.
Curling vinyl tile
Curls in your hair may look great, but when they’re in your vinyl flooring, 
they can lead to bigger problems. Curling vinyl occurs at seams and edges. 
The adhesive that’s supposed to hold the vinyl flat is no longer doing its job 
and, thus, the vinyl curls up and away from the underlayment.
Aside from being unsightly, this condition presents a trip hazard. It’s also a catch-
all for dirt and grime. Plus, it exposes the surface below to water damage and 
makes the area especially susceptible to tearing. What’s worse, left unrepaired, 
the condition will only get worse, which may turn a mole hill into a mountain.
To fix this problem, you have to remove the old vinyl tile and replace it with a 
new one. Follow these steps:
 
1. Use a warm iron over a towel to heat the vinyl and soften the adhesive.
 
 Make sure to warm the entire tile, including the edges and middle.
 
2. Carefully peel out the tile using a thin scraper, and then scrape out all 
the old adhesive.
 
3. Apply vinyl tile adhesive (get it at your favorite home center or floor-
ing store) all over the empty space.
 
 Use a notched trowel if you have one, or apply a thin, even coat using 
your scraper.
 
 In the case of vinyl floor adhesive, less is more. Too much adhesive can 
cause the tile to ripple.

232
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
 
4. Place the replacement tile (you set aside “spares,” didn’t you?) care-
fully into the hole and press on it with a block of wood to ensure good 
adhesion.
 
5. Remove the glue that squeezes out around the edges with a solvent 
like lacquer thinner or whatever the glue label suggests and a soft 
white cloth.
 
6. Lay a sheet of wax paper over the repair and then place a couple of 
books over the tile to weigh it down until the glue fully dries (usually 
24 hours).
 
7. Apply a clear vinyl seam sealer (also available at a home center or 
flooring store) around the edges.
Keep traffic out of the area for a day until the seam sealer has had a chance 
to set up.
Gouged, cut, or scratched sheet vinyl
In contrast to vinyl tile that has gobs of seams, sheet vinyl has far fewer 
seams. There is an advantage to fewer seams: fewer places to repair if some-
thing goes wrong. On the other hand, when it comes to making a patch, it can 
be a little trickier than replacing a single tile.
You’ll need the following items:
 
✓ Clothes iron
 
✓ Towel
 
✓ Utility knife and several new blades
 
✓ Metal straightedge
 
✓ Masking tape or double-sided tape
 
✓ Putty knife
 
✓ Vinyl adhesive
 
✓ Notched trowel
 
✓ Clean rags
 
✓ Adhesive solvent
 
✓ Clear vinyl seam sealer
 
✓ A piece of vinyl slightly larger than the area you want to patch
Finding a suitable patch
Obviously, the best patch is a piece of the original flooring material and one 
that gives you a chance to make an unnoticeable repair. (Look for squares 
or distinct patterns or lines you can use to hide your cuts.) If you or the 

233
 Chapter 12: Floors and Interior Doors
previous homeowner didn’t save a scrap, you can steal a patch from under-
neath an appliance or from a closet floor.
To remove a piece of vinyl to use as a patch:
 
1. Cut the patch carefully using a straightedge.
 
2. Peel up the patch, working slowly and using a warm iron over a towel 
(or a hot-air gun) and a putty knife.
 
 Try not to leave too much of the backing stuck to the floor.
 
3. Replace the stolen patch with any old scrap of vinyl floor. (Who’s 
going to see it?)
 
Older vinyl floors may have been waxed, and wax tends to yellow (especially in 
exposed locations). To make sure your patch matches the surrounding vinyl as 
closely as possible, remove all the wax from the entire floor using a commercial-
strength wax remover (available at a janitorial supply house) and floor scrubber. 
It’s a good idea to remove the built-up wax and re-wax every few years anyway.
Making the repair
To apply the patch, follow these steps:
 
1. Place the patch over the damaged area, match up the pattern or lines 
exactly, and then tape the patch in place.
 
 Again, it’s best to place your cuts in the lines that define squares in the 
pattern or something (anything!) other than “blank” areas.
 
2. Use a utility knife and fresh blade to cut through both the patch and 
the damaged area.
 
3. Set aside the patch and make sure the cuts went all the way through 
the damaged vinyl.
 
 Carefully deepen any cuts that are too shallow.
 
4. Make two corner-to-corner diagonal cuts in the repair area.
 
 Doing so makes it easier to remove the damaged section.
 
5. Peel back the damaged section from the middle.
 
 You might have to use the old iron-and-towel (or hot-air gun) trick to 
loosen the glue. Work slowly and carefully. If you’re using a pristine, 
never-been-glued patch, make sure to remove as much of the glue and 
stuck-down backing material as you can. If you’re using a “borrowed” 
patch that has some of the backing torn off, it’s okay if you leave some of 
the backing material stuck to the floor — it’ll help even things out.
 
6. Apply vinyl adhesive to the floor.
 
 Tub-and-tile caulk works great, too.

234
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
 
7. Carefully place the patch in the hole, but don’t press it down.
 
8. Cover the patch with wax paper; then place several heavy books 
on top.
 
 The bottom book should be bigger than the patch to avoid pushing the 
patch below the level of the surrounding floor. Let the adhesive cure for 
24 hours.
 
9. After 24 hours of curing time, remove the books and use mineral spir-
its to clean excess adhesive.
 
10. Apply clear vinyl seam sealer and let it set a day before allowing traf-
fic in the area.
 
 The key to applying seam sealer is to apply just enough to cover the 
seam. Again, less is more. The material is self-leveling, will bond with the 
vinyl, and is designed to disappear.
Sheet-vinyl bubbles
No matter how good your vinyl flooring is, or how well it was installed, bubbles 
or blisters will appear occasionally. Fortunately, they’re usually easy to fix.
 
Before you do anything, make a trip to the crawlspace or basement area below 
the floor in question to see if moisture is rising from below and causing the 
bubble. If the sub-area is wet, chances are, you’ve got water vapor migrating 
into the space between the floor and the vinyl and you’ve got big trouble. 
Believe us, soon a bubble will be the least of your problems if the sub-area 
water problem is not resolved. If moisture is the culprit, stop here and turn to 
Chapter 4 for advice on how to dry out your basement or crawlspace.
If your bubble isn’t caused by moisture rising from below, repairs are simple:
 
✓ Plan A: Use a large sewing needle to perforate small bubbles (1 inch or 
so in diameter) at their center. Make sure you go all the way through — 
you’re making the hole to allow trapped air to escape. Then get out the 
old iron, towel, and books. Lay the towel over the area and use the iron 
(not too hot!) to soften and flatten the vinyl. Place heavy books over the 
area to ensure good re-adhesion. (See Figure 12-1.)
 
✓ Plan B: If Plan A doesn’t work, you have to get a little glue into the 
bubble. To do this, you need a glue syringe. Insert the tip of the syringe 
into the hole you made with the needle, and squirt a couple of drops 
of adhesive (no more than that!) into the bubble. Place a piece of wax 
paper on the repair and stack the books on top. Why the wax paper? 
Because you don’t want to accidentally glue a book to the floor!
Mildew and mold below the surface of the vinyl
If black, brown, or purple stains are visible just below the surface of the 
vinyl, the only way to remove the stains is to remove the vinyl. These stains 
are mildew and fungus that are being fed by moisture from the crawlspace, 

235
 Chapter 12: Floors and Interior Doors
basement, or concrete slab or from water leaking beneath the vinyl from a 
source above it (shower, tub, sink, and so on).
 
Figure 12-1: 
Removing 
air bubbles 
from a vinyl 
floor.
 
 
If you have moisture under your floor covering, you have to find the source 
and stop it. Check out Chapter 4 for information on how to solve a moisture 
problem in your crawlspace or basement and how to seal concrete. Check the 
various plumbing chapters in Part III on how to deal with pipe leaks.
After you solve your moisture problem, you can then deal with the stained vinyl. 
If the damage is widespread, you unfortunately need to rip up the vinyl (and 
underlayment if the vinyl is on a wood floor). Underlayment is a layer of plywood 
or particleboard that is used atop wood floors as a smoothing layer on which 
the vinyl is laid). On concrete floors, the vinyl is glued directly to the concrete.
 
✓ To rip up the vinyl on a concrete floor: Remove the baseboard from the 
perimeter of the room so that you can grip the edge of the vinyl. Pull the 
vinyl up by hand. This should be relatively easy because the vinyl will 
separate from its paper backing.
 
 Most of the paper backing will remain stuck to the floor. Remove what’s 
left by wetting the paper with warm water in a sprayer. Then scrape; we 
use a reciprocating saw with a scraper blade.

236
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
 
✓ To rip up the vinyl on a wood floor: The vinyl is glued to the underlay-
ment, and the underlayment is stapled to the floor. Your best bet is to 
remove both layers at the same time. To do that, use a circular saw 
with the blade depth set at about 1/2 inch to cut the floor into 2-foot 
squares — like a checkerboard. (A 1/2-inch blade depth is enough depth 
to cut through the vinyl and the underlayment without damaging the 
substrate.) Pry up the squares using a flat pry bar.
Relaying a vinyl sheet floor covering (and underlayment if required) are tasks 
best performed by a flooring professional. Floor preparation, the amount and 
type of adhesive, and pattern cutting and placement are all key tasks that are 
not for the weak of heart.
Laminate love
Laminate has been one of the most popular finishes for kitchen counters for 
nearly half a century. Now, plastic laminate is one of the hottest products 
to hit the flooring market in decades. Harder than vinyl, it has the ability to 
match virtually any wood flooring or even ceramic tile pattern with uncanny 
accuracy. The reason? The floor pattern is essentially a photograph — but it’s 
coated with a protective layer that provides years of virtually maintenance-
free use, provided that you’re not too rough on it.
 
It’s like having your kitchen counters under foot — although laminate flooring 
has a harder finish, it can still scratch and dent.
Maintenance is simple. The first thing to keep in mind with laminate (and 
many other types of flooring) is to avoid abrasives, including abrasive clean-
ers. It also means keeping your floor clean from dirt, one of Mother Nature’s 
most natural abrasives. Door mats, gliders under chairs, and frequent vacu-
uming are the easiest ways to avoid wear and tear. Next, damp-mop the floor 
with clean water. As you mop, keep changing the water to avoid re-depositing 
dirt on the floor. Never use wax cleaners, polishes, or abrasives like steel 
wool or scouring powder.
You can fix scratches and dents using specially designed repair sticks or fill-
ers prepared by the flooring manufacturers. If you need such a fix, contact 
the manufacturer to find out what’s available. If you can’t locate an exact 
match, keep in mind that you can often mix two colors for a perfect blend. 
Just choose one that’s slightly lighter and one that’s slightly darker than the 
color of the spot you’re trying to match.
If you’ve got a really big boo-boo that’s ruined an entire piece, it can be suc-
cessfully cut out and replaced. This procedure, however, takes practice and 
is best left to a trained installer.

Ceramic tile a go-go
Got ceramic tile on the floor? Need to know how to care for it? Turn to 
Chapter 13 and read about caring for tile countertops. Everything we 
describe there works well for the floor, too. If you want to install a new tile 
floor, you need a different book; try Home Improvement For Dummies, by 
Gene and Katie Hamilton (Wiley Publishing).
 
If you want your ceramic tile floor to stay looking good, never, ever use an 
abrasive cleanser on it. It literally sands off the finish on the tiles. Check the 
labels of the products you use — you’ll be surprised by how many contain 
abrasives.
Wild things: Bamboo
Bamboo has become popular because it’s renewable and inexpensive, and it 
lasts a long time. To keep bamboo in good condition, do the following:
 
✓ Make sure the floor remains free of dirt and dust by using a broom, dry 
mop, or a soft brush attachment on your vacuum cleaner.
 
✓ When cleaning, avoid excessive water — use a slightly dampened mop.
 
✓ Never use abrasive cleansers or scouring pads on your bamboo. Just 
about any nonabrasive hardwood cleaner is suitable for use on a 
bamboo floor.
 
✓ Always read the instructions by the flooring manufacturer for best 
results, because some cleaners may void your warranty.
Engineered hardwood
Engineered hardwood has a very thin surface and must be meticulously 
maintained to ensure lasting quality. Engineered floors can be touch-sanded 
and varnished, but they can’t be deep-sanded. To keep engineered hardwood 
floors in good condition make sure to remove dirt and dust daily with a 
broom, dry mop, or soft brush attachment on your vacuum cleaner.
When cleaning any wood flooring, avoid excessive water. Use a slightly damp-
ened mop and never use abrasive cleansers or scouring pads on a hardwood 
floor (engineered or not). Most engineered flooring manufacturers offer an 
approved cleaner. Never use a cleaner on an engineered floor that has not 
been approved by the manufacturer.

Keeping natural hardwood good
Properly finished wood floors are, without a doubt, the easiest of all floor sur-
faces to keep clean and looking good.
Keep grit off the floor. Use walk-off mats at all exterior doors to help prevent 
dirt, grit, and sand from getting on your wood. Laying down throw rugs or 
small sections of carpet just inside the entrances is a good idea.
In addition, we recommend the following for maintaining your wood floors:
 
✓ Vacuum frequently to keep abrasive dirt to a minimum.
 
✓ In kitchens, use area rugs at high-spill locations and at work stations 
such as the stove, sink, and refrigerator.
 
✓ Avoid ultraviolet light damage to finishes by installing window tinting or 
draping large windows.
 
✓ Put fabric glides on the legs of your furniture to prevent scratching and 
scuffing when the furniture is moved.
 
✓ Wipe up spills immediately and then wipe dry.
 
✓ Clean using a not-very-damp mop and an oil soap solution, and then 
immediately wipe the floor dry.
If a floor is waxed, occasional buffing helps renew the shine and remove scuff-
marks that may appear in the wax coating. If the shine can’t be renewed in 
heavily used lanes, occasionally re-waxing these areas may be necessary. You 
may be able to go a year or longer between waxings if you’ve properly cared 
for your floor.
For more information on how to care for or repair your wood floor, contact 
the National Wood Flooring Association at 800-422-4556 or 636-519-9663, or go

Keeping carpet clean
 
Carpet-cleaning professionals tell us that the most effective method of keeping 
carpeting clean — and making it last a long time — is to vacuum it regularly. In 
fact, they recommend vacuuming three or more times per week, and daily in 
high-traffic areas.
They also point out that the quality of your vacuum makes a difference. An 
upright vac does the best job of removing deep-down dirt. But a big canister 
vac with a beater-bar head is good, too. Whichever you prefer, the motor 

239
 Chapter 12: Floors and Interior Doors
must be powerful enough to create enough suction to remove the dirt, sand, 
and debris that is ground into the carpet. If the vac has a beater bar, its 
brushes should be free of lint, fuzz, and threads. The suction port and hose 
should be checked regularly for suction-robbing blockages, and the bag 
should be changed frequently to ease the flow of air through the vac.
Why all this emphasis on vacuuming? Because soil is your carpet’s biggest 
enemy. Carpets wear out because foot traffic grinds embedded dirt into the 
carpet fiber. And vacuuming is the best way to reduce the dirt that works its 
way into the carpet.
 
Aside from regular vacuuming, the best way to keep your carpet clean and reduce 
wear is to place welcome mats outside every exterior door, and rugs on the inside 
to catch any leftover grit before it gets farther into the house. Finally, it really pays 
to have everyone remove their shoes when they come into the house.
But what do you do when little Nina spills some sticky red juice in the living 
room? Give her a big hug, tell her that you love her, and then spot-clean!
Spot cleaning
Most of today’s carpets are made with a factory-applied stain guard. So usu-
ally, a small amount of water and a drop of vinegar or club soda will get out a 
stain. Use a clean, white, dry cloth. Don’t scrub — blot.
 
The most common mistakes people make when they try to spot-clean are 
over-scrubbing and using too much water. Scrubbing destroys carpet fibers. 
Excess water gets below the carpet into the pad, which leads to mildew and a 
funky smell.
Over time, especially after numerous carpet cleanings, the factory-applied 
stain guard provides little stain protection. Although a host of stain repel-
lants are on the market, your best bet is to have an after-market stain guard 
installed by a professional carpet-cleaning and -dying company.
If this simple quick fix doesn’t work, there are a million carpet-cleaning prod-
ucts you can use. Just be sure to follow the directions on the label to the letter.
Carpet cleaning
Sooner or later, your carpet will need to be cleaned. Some people like to do 
the job themselves, while others would rather leave the job to a professional. 
The pros use a variety of methods, including dry powder, foam, and steam 
(hot-water extraction). Most do-it-yourself carpet-cleaning machines use the 
hot-water extraction method: A hot-water-and-detergent solution is sucked 
out of a reservoir, sprayed on the carpet, and immediately extracted with a 
powerful vacuum. The machines aren’t difficult to use — they’re just loud.

240
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
 
Here are a few tips that will help you be a carpet-cleaning success:
 
✓ Before you head off to the hardware store to rent a machine, you need 
to know what your carpet is made of in order to select the right cleaning 
solution.
 
✓ Before you start, test the solution on an out-of-the-way spot to make 
sure it won’t leave a stain of its own or bleach the color out.
 
✓ Read the instructions on the machine and on the detergent. Follow them 
exactly. This is no time to freelance.
 
✓ Don’t make the mistake of using too much water or too much detergent. 
Excess water creates mildew, and excess detergent stays in the carpet 
and attracts dirt like a magnet.
 
✓ Open the windows (or turn on the air conditioning) and use a powerful 
fan to help speed the drying process. The quicker you get the moisture 
out of the carpet, the better. If you can find one, rent a carpet-drying fan 
from a local tool-rental company; these fans are much more powerful 
than the most powerful fan found around the average home.
 
Professional carpet cleaning costs less than you think. In fact, the cost of renting 
a machine and buying carpet-cleaning solution may not be much less. Make a few 
phone calls before you decide to do the job yourself. One more thing: The truck-
mounted extraction machines that the pros use are way more powerful than any 
machine you can rent, so they get more dirt out and leave less moisture in.
De-stinking smelly carpet
Time, home life (especially cooking), and pets can make carpets stinky. You 
may not notice anymore, but anyone who comes into the house probably does. 
If your carpet has picked up a funky smell, you can try a commercial carpet 
deodorizer or you can go to the pantry and arm yourself with a box of baking 
soda. Sprinkle it into the carpet, leave it for a few hours, and then vacuum it up.
For less money and a little extra work, you can try sprinkling grated potato 
(yes, potato!) all over the carpet in question. Let it stand for several hours 
and then vacuum.
If neither of these methods works, stop trying to avoid the inevitable and call 
a carpet-cleaning company.
Interior Doors
As the soil around your home gains or loses moisture, it expands or con-
tracts and the house above moves with it. When the house moves, the door 
frames and doors shift — sometimes moderately and sometimes excessively. 

241
 Chapter 12: Floors and Interior Doors
This cycle of movement occurs every winter and every spring, making door 
repair an ongoing maintenance issue. Besides shifting, interior doors contain 
several components that can fail.
Common door-maintenance tasks
Whether it’s a swinging door, a bypass, or a bifold, doors or their compo-
nents eventually begin to wear or shift. When this happens they rattle, won’t 
close, and/or won’t latch or won’t open. It makes no difference whether the 
door is solid or hollow, wood, fiberglass, or metal; the typical repairs are usu-
ally treated in exactly the same way.
If your exterior doors are giving you problems, head back to Chapter 6.
Adjusting a sticking door
The most common door problem is sticking — when the door grabs the frame, 
making it hard to open or close. Sticking is caused by seasonal house move-
ment or house settlement. If the amount of grab is slight, the easiest solution is 
to sand the door. Hand-sanding or machine-sanding will do the trick. Be careful, 
though: Too much sanding can prove to be a problem. If the original problem 
was caused by seasonal shift and the door moves the opposite way during the 
next season, you may find the resultant gap to be an eyesore.
If the grab is extreme, your best bet is to call in a repair contractor to adjust 
the door and frame.
Repairing a door that closes by itself
Doors that close by themselves (ghost closing — probably Casper) can be 
repaired easily. Here’s how:
 
1. Remove one hinge pin (any one you like).
 
2. Take the removed hinge pin out to the sidewalk and lay it on the 
concrete.
 
3. Tap it once with a hammer to bend it slightly (10 or 15 degrees); see 
Figure 12-2.
 
4. Put the hinge pin back in the hinge.
 
 The door that once had a mind of its own will never be a problem again.
Repairing a loose hinge
Doors are heavy, and hinges are small. After years of use, hinge screws can 
loosen. You know what happens: You have to lift on the knob to get the door 
to close. Here’s why: The screw strips the wood and becomes loose in its 

242
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
hole — and that’s when the hinge starts to flop around. You can elect to use a 
longer screw to make this repair or you can do as we do and fix the stripped 
screw hole. The repair can be made with toothpicks — it’s easy:
 
1. Find the loose screws and remove them.
 
2. Use a few toothpicks dipped in wood glue to fill the stripped screw 
holes in the door or frame. Push as many of the glued toothpicks 
into the hole as possible and tap them into the hole with a small 
hammer — gently now.
 
3. Wait for the glue to dry completely.
 
4. Cut away the excess toothpicks and reinstall the old screw(s).

We’ve made this repair many times, and it works beautifully.
 
Replace the door on the track gently and carefully. Forcing the door into the 
track can bend either the door hardware or the track, which can make keeping 
the door on the track impossible.
Cutting to accommodate carpet
When new carpet is installed, some companies cut the door bottoms for you 
so that the door can open and close easily. (This also allows return air to flow 
back into your furnace or air-conditioning system. You’d be surprised by the 
amount of air that will travel through the small space between the bottom of 
the door and the carpet.) If your installers don’t cut the bottom of the door 
for you, you can do it yourself. Follow these easy steps:
 
1. With a pencil laid on its side on the carpet, mark a line along the 
entire length of the bottom of the door.
 
2. Remove the door by removing the hinge pins.
 
3. Place the door on a flat work surface or a couple of sawhorses.

243
 Chapter 12: Floors and Interior Doors
 
4. Use a utility knife to make a cut along the pencil line; then place duct 
tape just above the cut/pencil line.
 
 The slice made with the utility knife and the duct tape prevent damage 
to the door during the cutting process. Without these preventive mea-
sures, the cut line can easily chip and score.
 
5. Use a saw to cut off the bottom of the door.
Special tasks for different types of doors
Standard swinging doors (flush-mount doors) all end up needing the same 
types of repairs to resolve: sticking, swinging shut with no help, and not 
latching properly. After you’ve repaired one flush-mount door, you can repair 
them all. This isn’t so much the case with other types of doors that have 
different mounting devices and unusual hinges or tracks. In this section, we 
cover the most common problems with other types of doors.
Double-action swinging doors
Double-action swinging doors give their hinges a real test. After your kids go 
through them 29 million times, treating them as if they were a new Disneyland 
adventure, the mounting screws loosen, and the springs within the hinge 
weaken in spite of the fact that you may, from time to time, shoot them with a 
bit of silicone lubricant.
Many of these doors use double spring-action hinges that are self-closing and 
allow the doors to swing in both directions. Some have stops that allow the 
doors to remain open when they’re swung past 90 degrees. There are two 
main types of swinging door hinges: Some are mounted to a wood strip that 
you mount to the doorjamb. Others use a double-action pivot consisting of a 
heavy spring and a cam and are mounted either in the bottom of the door or 
in the floor.
Here’s what you can do for either type of hinge:
 
✓ Hinges in a wood strip mounted to the doorjamb: To adjust the hinge 
so the doors meet flush when closed, use the spring steel adjustment 
rod provided with the hinge. If you’ve lost the adjustment rod, use the 
long end of a snug-fitting Allen wrench. Push or pull the adjustment rod 
to increase the spring tension. This allows you to remove the pin that 
holds the spring in place. Move the pin so that the spring is one hole 
tighter; then check the door alignment. You may have to make adjust-
ments to the springs on both doors.

244
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
 
 Because there is a lot of pull on the screws that hold these hinges in 
place, replace the screws with 11/2- or 2-inch-long screws that reach into 
the studs behind the doorjamb.
 
✓ Hinges using a double-acting pivot mounted in the bottom of the 
door or in the floor: Dust and dirt are the biggest problems for these 
bottom-mounted spring devices. Keep them as clean as you possibly 
can by vacuuming frequently. If the spring is jammed, unscrew the cover 
plates from the hinge and vacuum. If you find any rust, scrape it off and 
vacuum again. Then spray the spring and the pivot with a silicone lubri-
cant. Clean and install the cover plates.
Pocket doors
This style of door is appropriately called a pocket door because, when in the 
open position, the door neatly slides into a void space in the wall. A pocket door 
glides on rollers that hang from a track mounted on the frame above the door.
Old-fashioned pocket doors always seemed to fall off the track. That doesn’t 
happen with the newer doors. But you may need to adjust the height of the 
doors because of changes in the floor covering. The procedures for doing 
this vary depending on the manufacturer and model of the door, but here are 
general guidelines:
 
1. Remove one of the split headers that hide and trim the roller track.
 
 Beneath the rollers, you find a hanger with an adjustment bolt and nut 
or screw.
 
2. Use a thin-end wrench or a screwdriver to turn the nut or screw to 
raise or lower the door.
To clean dust from the tracks, use a vacuum. Lubricate the rollers with spray 
silicone lubricant.
Silicone lubricant keeps the hardware locks functioning unless they become 
very dirty. In that case, remove the lock or lever and clean them in mineral 
spirits. Spray a coating of silicone on the interior parts; then reassemble.
Bypass and bifold doors
Bypass and bifold doors ride on tracks and often are derailed. To fix this 
common problem, do the following:
 
✓ For bypass doors: Hold the door at about a 15-degree angle into the 
room and then engage the rollers into the track.
 
✓ For bifold doors: Simply press downward on the roller at the top of the 
door and then align it with the track above. Once aligned, simply release 
the roller and watch it pop into the track.

245
 Chapter 12: Floors and Interior Doors
Shower doors
When a snoopy guest uses your bathroom, the first thing he looks at is the 
shower door. Is it clean? Here’s how to clean a shower door and keep it that way:
 
✓ Using lemon-oil polish and a scouring pad, scrub the glass panels with 
gusto. If the door has acrylic panels, go easy on the scrubbing or you 
may scratch the acrylic.
 
✓ Scrub with sodium carbonate. You can find a pure form of sodium car-
bonate, called pH Increaser, at swimming pool retailers.
 
✓ Use a sponge and dishwashing detergent to clean the shower door 
(and the rest of the shower stall) after every shower.
 
✓ Place a couple of small suction cups that have small hooks on the inside 
of a shower door. Use the pair of hangers to suspend a vinegar-soaked rag 
on the inside of the shower door. Reposition the hangers and rag periodi-
cally to conquer small sections at a time. This may sound funny and look 
terrible, but it’s inside the shower, and your guests won’t see it unless 
they’re really snoopy. The vinegar will soften the mineral deposits. Really 
dirty shower doors may require some scrubbing with a nylon scouring pad.
If the doors get out of alignment, or the rollers come off the track, you can 
usually reset the doors by lifting them in the frame and resetting the rollers in 
the channel.
When the doors drag, or they don’t stay in the bottom channel, you need to 
adjust the rollers. Follow these steps:
 
1. Lift the outer door until the rollers clear the top track; then pull the 
bottom of the door out and away from the bottom channel and set it 
aside. Do the same with the inner door.
 
2. Clean debris from the bottom track and clean the door frames using 
our Easy All-Surface Mildew Remover (see Chapter 20).
 
3. Loosen the screws that hold the rollers to the door frame and adjust 
them to raise or lower the door as needed.
 
 If the screws are rusted, replace them with zinc-coated or stainless-steel 
screws.
 
4. Spray a dry silicone lubricant lightly on the rollers to keep them oper-
ating smoothly.
Knobs, locks, and latches (oh my!)
How could anyone possibly write a biography about Martin without includ-
ing Lewis? And what about Abbot and Costello? In the same vein, how could 
anyone expect us to write a chapter about doors without including door 
hardware? You know — knobs, locks, and latches.

246
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
Dirty knobs (not legal in every state)
Barring a damaged finish, just about the only problems you’ll have with door-
knobs and sliding door latches are (1) screws that loosen and (2) collected 
dirt that jambs up the mechanism. In our 31-plus years as contractors, we 
haven’t ever seen a doorknob fail — at least not yet! We’ve found that clean-
ing and lubrication can solve most problems.
When a doorknob, key lock, or sliding-door latch begins to stick intermittently, 
or when it isn’t operating as smoothly as usual, it’s probably gunked up with 
dirt. When this happens, most of us have the tendency to use a lubricant to 
solve the problem. Don’t! Lubricant is used to reduce friction, not clean.
 
If you have a sticky doorknob, we suggest spraying cutting oil into the works. 
Cutting oil cleans and lubricates. Better yet, take a few moments to remove the 
hardware and dip it into a bath of cutting oil. Follow the bath with a spray of light 
machine oil — sewing machine oil is great — and reinstall the knob. Ninety-nine 
percent of the time, it’ll operate like it’s brand-new. This procedure has worked 
successfully for us on doorknobs and levers, deadbolts, throw bolts, and patio-
door latches — just about any door hardware that we’ve ever had to maintain.
Someone told us your screws were loose
You reach for the doorknob, and as you grip it, you notice that it’s shifted 
from its original position. You can see where the trim ring and the paint don’t 
line up. You try wiggling the knob in hopes that it won’t move, thinking to 
yourself that if it doesn’t, further attention on your part won’t be required. 
Hey, sooner or later you’ll have to deal with it. The nice thing is that the 
maintenance is unbelievably easy.
To solve the problem, tighten the screws that hold the knob in place. Often 
their location is pretty obvious. Usually they can be found at the interior 
trim ring, although on some hardware the screws are hidden. To tighten the 
screws on these models, do the following:
 
1. Using the blade of a small screwdriver, depress the small push-button 
release found in the shaft of the knob to pull the knob away from the 
door.
 
 The push button is usually located on the underside of the knob shaft.
 
2. Remove the knob and pop off the trim ring by applying pressure to a 
small spring lever located at the inside edge of the trim ring.
 
 Alternatively, pry it off with a screwdriver. The screws — two of them — 
will be directly beneath the trim ring.
 
3. Tighten the screws snugly in place and replace the trim ring and the 
knob.

First time around, the process may confuse you slightly. After one time, you’ll 
wonder how anything so simple ever avoided your attention.
 
You can keep key locks lubricated with graphite powder, but it can be a bit 
messy, and there’s a chance that using too much could temporarily jamb the 
lock. However, there is an easy and inexpensive alternative: Rub a pencil onto 
your key. Then push the key into the lock. The lead, which is actually a graphite 
compound, will transfer to the lock and lubricate it. It really does a great job.
The strike plate
When is a plate big enough to hold a door closed, but not large enough to 
hold lunch? When it’s a strike plate — that’s when. If you just laughed, then 
you know that the strike plate is the small metal thing attached to the door 
frame that interlocks with the bolt on the doorknob when the door is closed. 
The strike plate is so named because it’s what the bolt “strikes” as the door is 
being closed.
The strike plate actually serves three purposes:
 
✓ Its curved outer edge helps to gradually depress the bolt as the door 
closes.
 
✓ It acts as a shield preventing wear and tear to the doorframe.
 
✓ When interlocked with the bolt, it holds the door snugly to the frame. 
With some strike plates, this function is adjustable.
One of the major causes of door (and window) misalignment is house move-
ment. Actually, if a house didn’t move, there would probably never be a need 
to realign its doors. However, until homes stop shifting, doors will have to 
be tweaked one way or another, and the process will often have to include 
adjusting the strike plate to realign it with the door bolt.
Closing the door just enough for the bolt to lay on the outside edge of the 
strike plate can give you a good idea of why the bolt isn’t interlocking with 
the strike plate. The bolt must rest centered between the top and bottom of 
the plate. If the bolt is lower than center, the plate must be lowered. If the 
bolt is higher than center, the plate should be raised.
Most often, the adjustment needed is extremely minor. Place a chisel into 
the hole in the strike plate. To lower the strike plate, hold the edge of the 
chisel against the bottom of the hole and tap downward on the chisel with 
a hammer. One light blow is all that it usually takes to move the strike plate 
enough to clear the bolt. Hold the chisel against the top of the opening and 
lightly tap upward with the hammer to move the plate up. Keep in mind that 
if the strike plate has to be moved more than 1/8 inch, the door may have to 
be adjusted instead. In some cases you may need to adjust both the door and 
strike plate.

248
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
Two screws hold a strike plate in place. Slam a door often enough and the 
screws will definitely come loose, resulting in a door that wobbles when 
closed. First, try tightening the screws. If they’re stripped, which is often the 
case, do this:
 
1. Remove the screws and the strike plate.
 
2. Dip two golf tees in glue.
 
3. Drive one golf tee into each of the holes.
 
4. When the glue has dried, cut off the excess golf tees with a utility 
knife.
 
5. Reinstall the strike plate.
 
 No more wobble!
Loving your locks
In addition to making sure that your locks are securely fastened to the door, 
you also need to clean and lubricate locks to keep them in good working 
order.
To remove the lock so that you can clean it, first unscrew the screws hold-
ing the faceplate on the inside knob and remove the knobs. Then remove the 
screws in the latch plate and remove the latch bolt assembly. The latch is 
that part of the door hardware that fits into the strike plate on the door frame 
when the door is closed. Clean the latch bolt assembly with mineral spirits. 
Lubricate the assembly with silicone spray, and then reinstall the lockset.
Bolts that hang up on the latch plate may catch on paint. Remove the paint 
and lubricate the bolt.

K
itchen and bathroom cabinets take a beating. Day in and day out, their 
doors and drawers are opened and closed many, many times, which 
gives hinges, door catches, and drawer guides a real test. Not to mention that 
little kids often use drawers as “steps,” and have been known to create a little 
cheap entertainment by swinging on cabinet doors. Wheee! That much use, 
and that kind of abuse, is tough on cabinets. Frequent cleaning to remove 
dirty, oily handprints and greasy buildup can go a long way toward keeping 
your cabinets looking great. However, eventually you need to kick it up a 
notch. Luckily, most of the time all you need to do is throw on some paint, 
revarnish, or just repair scratches and dings. And a quick drawer-glide repair, 
knob replacement, or hinge adjustment can make your cabinets look and feel 
like new (well, almost new).
Countertops are pretty tough. They can be made of plastic laminate (a thin 
layer of plastic glued onto a wood-composite base), solid surface (solid plas-
tic or solid acrylic), ceramic tile, stone (such as marble or granite), or wood 
butcher block. Each surface requires different care; when they’re damaged, 
they need different cures for what ails them. In many instances, these cures 
also protect these surfaces and, therefore, extend their life span.
In this chapter, we look at both cabinets and countertops, even though 
they’re made of different kinds of materials and require different kinds of care 
and repair. Why discuss them together? Because you find them together in 
the home, and, to us, that’s a great reason to lump them into one chapter.

Keeping Cabinets Looking Great: 
Cleaning Know-How
Kitchen cabinets are magnets for grease, food bits, spills, and moisture. This 
slimy crud builds up, making them look dingy and dirty. As the paint or var-
nish on the cabinet wears, the wood beneath can become stained or even 
damaged.
If your cabinets aren’t terribly nicked up or scratched, and they have drawers 
and doors that still work well, all they may need is a little TLC. In fact, a good 
cleaning could be just the trick to make their surfaces look new again.
Cleaning wood cabinets
To give varnished wood cabinets a super cleaning, use our Super Wood 
Cleaner (see Chapter 20).
 
This formula is not made for painted surfaces. If you have painted wood cabi-
nets, skip ahead to the next section, “Cleaning painted wood, metal, laminate, 
or vinyl-covered cabinets.”
After you’ve mixed up our Super Wood Cleaner, follow these steps:
 
1. Remove all the drawer pulls and door handles from the cabinets, and 
cover the countertops and floors with dropcloths.
 
2. While wearing rubber gloves, wet a soft rag in the Super Wood 
Cleaner and ring it out well.
 
3. Thoroughly wipe all cabinet surfaces (inside and out), doing small sec-
tions at a time.
 
4. Wipe the surface dry with a clean rag.
 
5. Repeat the wiping and drying until all old wax, sticky grease film, and 
grubby fingerprints are gone.
 
6. Replace the pulls and handles.
 
Our Super Wood Cleaner is moderately flammable. For safety’s sake, don’t 
smoke while you’re using it or work with it near open flames. Don’t try to 
reheat the mixture — mix up a new batch when it gets cold. Dispose of any 
leftover by letting it evaporate outside — don’t pour it down the drain. Let the 
rags completely air-dry outside before disposing of them in the trash. (Don’t 
keep these rags inside — they’re subject to spontaneous combustion!)

Cleaning painted wood, metal, laminate, 
or vinyl-covered cabinets
If your cabinets are painted wood, metal, laminate, or vinyl-covered, you can 
clean them with warm, soapy water and a sponge:
 
1. Cover the floor and countertops from spills and splashes using 
dropcloths.
 
 If you want to do a really thorough job, remove the drawer pulls and 
door handles from the cabinets.
 
2. Mix up a lightly soapy solution using dishwashing soap.
 
 Don’t go crazy — one small squirt will be plenty.
 
3. With a wrung-out sponge that’s wet but not drippy, thoroughly wipe 
the door and drawer fronts and everything in between (the face frame).
 
 Get into the nooks and crannies, and don’t forget the edges.
 
 Do one section at a time. You don’t want water to sit too long on the 
wood or begin to dry.
 
4. Remove any soapy residue with a cloth and clean water, and then 
thoroughly dry the cabinets with towels.
 
5. If you removed the pulls and handles from the cabinets, replace them 
after the cabinets are dry.
Something Old Is Something New: 
Refinishing Your Cabinets
If cleaning doesn’t do the trick, and your cabinets still look lousy, then it’s 
time to cover up their flaws. In fact, a few minor surface repairs and a fresh 
coat of paint or varnish can make your old cabinets look new, make them 
easier to care for, and probably brighten up the room.
 
Not only does the cabinet finish look good, but it also protects the wood 
from moisture damage, a common problem in the places where cabinets are 
installed — kitchens and bathrooms.
 
Here’s a way to get a new look for a little moolah: If your cabinets could use 
a little pick-me-up, but they don’t quite need to be refinished, replace the 
drawer pulls and door handles. Nothing perks up your cabinets — and your 
mood — like new hardware!

Getting your cabinets ready for refinishing
Before you paint or varnish your cabinets, you have to get them ready. If you 
don’t prepare properly, your paint will peel or your varnish will look lousy. 
Follow these steps:
 
1. Remove the cabinet doors and drawers, being sure to label them with 
removable stickers so that you can get them back in the right place.
 
 You may have to move or remove the refrigerator, range, or vent hood 
to complete the job. If so, clean behind the refrigerator, under the stove, 
and up inside the range hood. (Why pass up this great opportunity for a 
thorough cleaning?)
 
2. Remove the drawer pulls, door handles, and hinges.
 
 Do this job in your garage or basement workshop to minimize disruption 
and mess in the kitchen.
 
3. If you intend to reuse the pulls, handles, and hinges, soak them in a 
mild solution of soap and water.
 
 Don’t use ammonia — it can remove the plated finish.
 
4. Wash all the cabinet surfaces and the drawer and door surfaces with 
a mild solution of trisodium phosphate (TSP), a heavy-duty all-purpose 
cleaner, and wipe them dry.
 
5. Lightly sand all the surfaces you plan to paint.
 
 Use 200- or 120-grit sandpaper if you intend to paint, or 400- or 600-grit 
sandpaper if you intend to varnish.
 
 The goal is not to remove all the paint or varnish, but to create a uni-
form surface for the new finish. So don’t go nuts — just get it smooth.
One small budget, one huge success
We have friends who had a terrible-looking set 
of kitchen cabinets and a terribly limited remod-
eling budget. The cabinets were real wood, 
however, and our friends had to admit that they 
still worked fine. They tried repainting the cabi-
nets to see if they could avoid buying new ones. 
And when they were done, the cabinets looked 
beautiful! The total cost? Less than $750! What’s 
more, they saved more than $15,000 in what it 
would have cost to remove the cabinets and 
replace them with new ones. The bottom line: 
Not every kitchen remodeling job has to cost 
$25,000 or more. Sometimes the simplest things, 
like a coat of paint, can make a big difference.

253
 Chapter 13: Cabinets and Countertops
 
6. If you’re painting, fill all nicks and blemishes with vinyl spackling 
compound and, when dry, sand the compound lightly. If you’re var-
nishing, use colored putty, being careful to remove the excess from 
around the gouge.
 
 A second application of spackle or putty may be necessary if the first 
coat shrinks.
 
7. Vacuum the cabinets, drawers, and doors using an upholstery brush.
 
8. Wipe down the cabinets with a tack cloth or a soft cloth dampened 
with mineral spirits.
Painting or varnishing . . . at last!
When your cabinets are suitably prepared (see the preceding section), you’re 
ready to paint or varnish. Follow these steps:
 
1. Cover everything with canvas or heavy plastic dropcloths.
 
 Use masking tape to protect the counters where they meet the cabinets 
and to create a paint/no-paint edge on the interiors.
 
2. If you’re painting, apply a coat of oil-based primer. (Skip this step if 
you’re varnishing.)
 
 If the cabinets are dark, use a heavily pigmented shellac-based primer 
to conceal the color and seal in the dark stain. If you’re making a big 
change in color, have the primer tinted at the paint store to closely (but 
not exactly) match the finished color.
 
3. If you’re painting, finish the cabinets with a high-quality, oil-based, 
high-gloss or semigloss enamel. If you’re varnishing, apply a coat of 
high-quality, oil-based, glossy or satin-finish polyurethane.
 
 Use a natural-bristle brush. You may want to enhance spreadability 
and reduce brush strokes by thinning the paint or varnish a little with 
mineral spirits.
 
4. Cover the drawer bodies with plastic and mask the edges of the 
drawer bodies where they meet the fronts.
 
5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the doors and drawers.
 
6. Replace the hinges, pulls, and handles.
 
You can make your old grungy, grimy hinges, pulls, and handles look new 
again by soaking them overnight in a mild solution of dishwashing liquid and 
warm water — about 1 tablespoon to 1 quart of water. Mix the solution in a 
plastic bucket and allow the hardware to soak overnight. Use a nylon-bristle 

254

brush to get into the nooks and crannies, rinse, and towel-dry. Use a fine metal 
cleaner and polish such as Flitz to remove stains and blemishes and provide a 
protective finish.
Maintaining Your Cabinets
After you have your cabinets looking good (whether you’re starting with 
new cabinets, you’ve just cleaned your cabinets, or you’ve refinished them), 
you still need to do some tasks on a regular basis to keep them looking good 
and working well in the future. Don’t worry: None of these tasks requires any 
special tools or materials, and together they take no more than half an hour 
to do.
Once a year, do the following:
 
✓ Tighten drawer pulls and door handles. Don’t over-tighten them. One-
quarter turn beyond snug should do the trick.
 
✓ Lubricate and adjust the hinges. Don’t go crazy — a drop of fine machine 
oil is plenty. Remember: Less is more when it comes to lubrication.
 
✓ Lubricate and adjust the drawer slides. A little squirt of WD-40 works 
well on metal guides. Use beeswax or paraffin if your drawers have 
wooden guides.
 
✓ Remove finger smudges. Try spray cleaner first. If that doesn’t work, try 
a vinegar-and-water solution (one part vinegar to three parts water). If 
all else fails, put a little mineral spirits on a rag, and use that to wipe off 
the smudges.
Making Your Lovely Laminate Last
You may know it by one of its popular brand names (such as Formica or 
Wilsonart), but the generic name for that slick countertop material with the 
rolled nosing and integral backsplash is plastic laminate. Common plastic 
laminate is nothing more than a very thin piece of plastic combined with 
several thin layers of resin-coated paper. A heating process is used to bond 
the paper and plastic, and what results is a somewhat-flexible, waterproof 
material that has any number of practical uses. It’s cemented onto a solid 
surface — such as plywood or hardboard — to give it strength and support.

255
 Chapter 13: Cabinets and Countertops
Cleaning and caring for your laminate
You can easily keep a laminate countertop nice and clean. All you need is 
water, a little soap, and a stiff nylon brush. Mix the water and the soap, and 
then scrub away with the brush. You’d be surprised at how dirty a counter-
top that looks clean really is.
After your countertop is super-clean, consider giving it a coat of car wax. Wax 
will protect laminate in the same way that it protects the painted surfaces of 
a car. Waxing takes a little effort, but at least you won’t have to worry about 
scraping your hand on the edge of a license plate.
 
If you’re handy with a buffer, you can use it to get an extra-glossy shine. But be 
very careful: Too much high-speed buffing wrecks the plastic laminate surface.
 
Here are a few tips that will help you keep your laminate countertops looking 
lovely for a long time:
 
✓ Avoid using abrasive cleaners. That means no Ajax, no Comet, and no 
Soft Scrub.
 
✓ Don’t let water stand, especially on seams and along the backsplash.
 
✓ Always use a cutting board. Laminate is too soft to stand up to knives.
 
✓ Never place a hot pan directly on the surface.
Bursting bubbles
Laminate countertops are made of a thin sheet of plastic bonded with con-
tact cement to a plywood or hardboard base. Sometimes the contact cement 
loses its stickiness, and the laminate forms a bump. Luckily, it’s easy to stick 
the laminate back down (see Figure 13-1):
 
1. Place a slightly damp towel over the bubble.
 
2. Apply low heat with a clothes iron for 10 seconds (see Figure 13-1).
 
 This process softens the laminate and “re-stickifies” the contact cement.
 
3. Immediately place several heavy books on the repaired spot and 
leave them there for 12 hours.
 
 The books keep the laminate in contact with the cement as it re-cures.

Hiding chips, cuts, and scratches
Sooner or later, your nice laminate countertop will be chipped, cut, or 
scratched. This problem is more than just cosmetic — water can travel 
through the open area and damage the base.
When you get done yelling at the person responsible, head out to the nearest 
home center for a SeamFil chip-filler kit and a brand-new, well-polished putty 
knife. SeamFil kits come in 20 colors; mix them to match your countertop. It 
dries to a satin finish, and a gloss additive lets you match shiny surfaces. Just 
follow the directions on the package.
 
Neither SeamFil nor any other similar product can make a countertop gouge 
invisible; they just make them less noticeable. However, the repair does 
become water-resistant.
Caring for Super Solid Surfaces
You probably know this easy-to-care-for countertop material by one of its 
brand names — Corian, Avonite, and a number of others — but the generic 
name for it is solid-surface countertops. Plain and simple, solid-surface coun-
tertops require little care and are virtually impossible to permanently damage.
Because these countertops are made of a nonporous, plastic, or plastic-like 
material, soap and water are all you need to keep them clean.

257
 Chapter 13: Cabinets and Countertops
 
Got some light scratches, stains, or scorched spots? The first thing you should 
do is go to the manufacturer’s Web site and find the care-and-repair instructions. 
Then follow the steps to the letter, using the exact materials recommended.
Don’t know the manufacturer? Don’t know how to use the Internet? Forgot 
how to read? If all you want to fix is light surface scratches or stains, you can 
do the repair with a lightly abrasive cleaner like Soft Scrub and some elbow 
grease. If that doesn’t do the job, use an abrasive sponge (such as a Scotch-
Brite pad) to lightly “sand” the surface smooth. Don’t press too hard, and 
make sure that the area remains wet while you work, to reduce the chances 
of creating new scratches.
 
Don’t attempt this repair if your countertop has a high-gloss finish — the 
repaired area will not be glossy anymore.
Things get dicier if you have deep scratches, burns, and deep stains. The best 
answer is to call in a pro to resurface the area (and maybe the entire counter-
top). The next best answer, if you’re feeling bold, is to lightly hand-sand the 
area using 400-grit wet/dry sandpaper. Keep the area wet while you work. Don’t 
get carried away. Do not use a power sander — you’ll ruin your countertop.
 
The manufacturer of your countertop probably offers a repair kit. If you need 
to undo some self-inflicted imperfection, read the instructions and do exactly 
what the manufacturer’s instructions tell you to do.
Keeping Your Tile Terrific
Ceramic tile countertops offer a trade-off: They last forever, but they require 
more maintenance than other types of countertops. If you ask us, it’s worth 
the extra work.
The tile itself is tough — it’s the grout you have to worry about. Grout is the 
cement-like stuff that fills the gaps between tiles, and it readily absorbs mois-
ture and stains.
Sealing out grout grunge
Grout sealer goes a long way toward preventing stains and keeping your 
beautiful new countertop looking good. The trick is, you have to wait at least 
72 hours for the grout to cure (dry) before you can seal it.

258
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
Your local home center probably has several different brands of grout-and-
tile sealer with handy sponge-tip applicators. A silicone-based sealer is best.
Sealing grout can take several hours to do depending upon the amount of 
tile that you have, so plan not to be in a big hurry. Follow each grout line with 
the sealer applicator, making sure you’re getting the sealer down into the 
lines. (Follow the manufacturer’s directions for application.) Apply a second 
coat 24 hours later and a third coat 24 hours after that. Big fun — but totally 
necessary.
Cleaning grubby grout
To clean your grout, you need a bottle of vinegar, water, and a small brass 
brush. (A steel brush would leave rust marks in the grout and dark scratches 
in the tile.) If you can’t find a brass brush, grab a couple of brand-new hard 
toothbrushes. Then follow these steps:
 
1. In a big jar, make a solution of one part water, one part vinegar.
 
2. Dip the brush in the solution and start scrubbing the grout.
 
 Yes, cleaning grout takes a while. And yes, it’s tedious. The vinegar, a 
weak acid, helps remove hard-water deposits and other hard-to-remove 
chemical stains.
 
3. Remove the sour-smelling solution by wiping the countertop thor-
oughly with a damp sponge.
If the old sauerbraten treatment doesn’t do the trick, grab a bottle of hydro-
gen peroxide (the stuff for disinfecting cuts) and pour a generous amount 
all over the grout. The peroxide whitens the grout and helps dislodge stains 
caused by foods. Let it sit for about 15 minutes, and then scrub like crazy 
using a nylon scrub brush. After scrubbing, wipe down the surface with a 
damp sponge.
If neither vinegar nor hydrogen peroxide gets the grout nice and white, you 
have to scrub using a weak bleach solution — 2 tablespoons of bleach per 
quart of water. Open the windows, turn on the vent hood, and bring a box fan 
up from the basement. Wear old clothes, eye protection, and gloves. Scrub 
carefully, rinse thoroughly, and then rinse again.
 
When you’re working with bleach, more is not better. If you use more than the 
recommended amount of bleach, you’ll give yourself one heck of a headache 
and a wheezy cough. Ask any doctor: Breathing chlorine fumes is not good. 
And, as always, never mix other chemicals or household cleaners with bleach.

259
 Chapter 13: Cabinets and Countertops
If your grout is still grubby after this all-out chemical assault, the only solu-
tion is to apply a grout stain (see the next section) or replace the grout (see 
“Replacing grout,” later in the chapter).
Staining grubby grout
Grout stains are essentially paint. You can find them at any decent home 
center or tile store.
Before you apply the stain, you have to get the grout really, really, really 
clean: Clean the grout (see the preceding section), rinse it thoroughly, and 
allow the grout to dry overnight. Then apply the grout stain according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions exactly — this is no time for creativity.
 
Although grout stain is a time- and energy-saving alternative to grout replace-
ment, it doesn’t last forever — you have to re-stain every year or two.
 
If you have just one spot that won’t come clean, you can “stain” it white using 
white shoe polish on a Q-tip or a tiny artist’s paintbrush. Wite-Out correction 
fluid also works well.
Replacing grout
Cracked, deteriorating grout can allow water underneath the tile, where wood 
rot can occur. Replacing grout will make your counters look better and last 
longer. How often can you kill two birds with one stone?
There are two different kinds of grout: cement-based and epoxy-based. For 
a number of very good reasons (cost and ease of use, primarily), you want 
to use cement-based grout. For thin (1/8-inch) joints between tiles, use plain 
unsanded grout. For wide (1/4-inch) joints, use sanded grout.
 
Grout comes in a rainbow of colors, and your choice has a big effect on the 
appearance of the finished countertop. Choose the color you want, but know 
that dark-colored grout hides dirt and stains better — and is easier to clean — 
than light-colored or white grout.
Removing the old grout and debris
Before you can do any actual grout application, you have to “saw” out 
old, bad grout from the joints between the tiles. You can use a grout saw 
to remove the old grout (as shown in Figure 13-2), but for most people, a 

260
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
church-key-style can-opener does the job. The really sophisticated (read: 
lazy) do-it-yourselfer uses a Dremel tool with a tiny grinding bit.
 
Figure 13-2: 
Using a 
grout saw 
to remove 
grout.
 
 
If you use a grout saw or can opener, work slowly and carefully. Just aim to 
get out the loose stuff — if you get too aggressive, and the tool slips out of the 
joints, you’ll gouge the tiles. The same goes for doing the job with a Dremel 
tool. Stay focused and don’t apply too much pressure. Also, be sure to wear 
eye protection.
When you’ve got all the loose grout out, vacuum the surface and wipe with a 
damp sponge to get up every bit of dust and debris.
Re-grouting your tile
With the grout and dust gone, it’s time to get grouting! You need the following:
 
✓ Grout (powdered or premixed)
 
✓ Rubber float or squeegee
 
✓ Big sponge
 
✓ Popsicle stick
 
✓ Toothbrush
 
✓ Rags or cheesecloth

261
 Chapter 13: Cabinets and Countertops
 
✓ Vinegar
 
✓ Bucket
 
✓ Rubber gloves (grout is caustic before it dries)
To re-grout, follow these steps:
 
1. If you bought powdered grout, mix it with cold water, according to 
the manufacturer’s directions.
 
 Make only as much as you think you can use in 30 minutes, which is not 
a lot — typically less than a small pail. Be sure to use cold water; warm 
water can cause some colors to mottle when they dry.
 
2. While wearing rubber gloves, apply the grout to the surface of the 
tiles diagonally, using the rubber float or squeegee held at a 45-degree 
angle to the surface of the tiles.
 
 Work in a 3-foot-square area. Spread the grout liberally and force it into 
the joints. Use the Popsicle stick for corners and small, tough-to-reach 
spots. Remove excess grout with the rubber float and/or a damp sponge 
as you go.
 
3. Let the grout set for 20 minutes or however long the manufacturer 
suggests.
 
4. Wipe the entire surface with a damp sponge and keep wiping until all 
the grout lines are even and the joints are smooth.
 
 Rinse the sponge frequently.
 
5. Let the grout dry for another 20 minutes.
 
6. Polish the tiles with a rag or cheesecloth.
 
 Use an old toothbrush to get into the corners and hard-to-reach areas.
 
7. Mix fresh grout and move on to another area, repeating steps 2 
through 6 until the entire tiled surface is grouted.
 
8. When all the freshly grouted areas are dry, remove any grout haze 
(residue left on the tiles by the grout) with soft rag and a 10 percent 
solution of vinegar and water.
 
 You may have to wipe off the haze several times before the tile surface is 
completely clean.
 
9. Caulk where the countertop meets the walls and the backsplash and 
around the edge of the sink.
 
10. Seal all the joints with grout sealer (see “Sealing out grout grunge,” 
earlier in this chapter).

Replacing a broken tile
Got a loose tile? Dropped the big soup pot and cracked one? Worried about 
how it looks or that you might accidentally slash your wrist on the sharp 
edge? It’s time for replacement!
If you’re lucky enough to have a leftover tile stashed in your workbench, you’re 
ready to go. But if you don’t, you have to go on a tile hunt. Chip out a sample 
(read on for instructions) and take it to the biggest tile dealer you can find. If 
it’s a standard, really common tile, they’ll either have an exact match or a tile 
that’s very, very similar in color and texture. If your tile isn’t common, they 
probably have old partial boxes and piles of leftover discontinued tiles in the 
back for you to paw through. Good luck! (You’re going to need it.)
 
If you can’t find an acceptable match, consider replacing several tiles. You can 
randomly add tiles in a contrasting color or use decos (decorator tiles with 
pictures).
With your replacement tile in hand, grab the tools you need:
 
✓ Grout saw or Dremel tool
 
✓ Glass cutter
 
✓ Hammer and a cold chisel (the kind that isn’t for use on wood)
 
✓ Electric drill with a 1/4-inch masonry bit
 
✓ Mastic (tile adhesive)
 
✓ Putty knife
 
✓ Block of wood bigger than the tile
 
✓ Masking tape
 
✓ Eye protection
Follow these steps to replace the broken tile (and take note of how often we 
use the word carefully):
 
1. Carefully remove the grout from the joints around the damaged tile 
using a grout saw or a Dremel tool.
 
2. Use a drill to carefully bore a hole in the center of the tile and use a 
glass cutter to carefully scribe an X in the tile (corner to corner).
 
 Drilling a hole in the center and crosscutting the surface acts to relieve 
pressure when you begin to remove the tile with a hammer and chisel. 
Relieving pressure helps prevent damage to surrounding tiles.

263
 Chapter 13: Cabinets and Countertops
 
3. Use a hammer and chisel to carefully remove the tile and clean out 
the area behind it.
 
 Carefully remove all adhesive and grout. Try not to pry underneath 
adjacent tiles — you could loosen them.
 
4. Test-fit the replacement tile to make sure it sits well with the other 
tiles.
 
 You want it to be slightly recessed to leave room for adhesive.
 
5. Carefully spread mastic on the back of the tile with a putty knife.
 
 Keep the mastic 1/4 to 1/2 inch from the edges for squishing room.
 
6. Carefully place the tile in position, and wiggle it a little to ensure 
good contact between the tile, the adhesive, and the base.
 
7. Place the block of wood over the tile and give it a couple gentle taps 
to make extra sure the tile is flush with its neighbors and to make 
super sure that the adhesive is stuck to everything.
 
8. Tape the wood over the repair to protect the repair.
 
9. Wait at least 24 hours and then apply grout (see the “Re-grouting your 
tile” section).
Protecting Marvelous Marble
Whether in sheets or pieces, marble is an elegant surface. Unfortunately, it’s 
unbelievably soft. Many folks think that marble is a type of stone. It isn’t — 
it’s actually petrified calcium (old seashells) and can be easily damaged. A 
spill of orange juice, a few drops of hair spray, or a splash of your favorite 
alcoholic beverage is all it takes to damage marble.
If you see a circle on the counter where the juice glass once was, you can 
count on the fact that the spot has been permanently etched. You can hire 
someone to polish etched areas, but a better — and cheaper — solution is to 
keep alcohol and even the mildest acids away from marble.
 
Despite your best efforts, you may end up with a stain. Here’s a neat trick 
that you can use to clean stained marble: You’ll need half a lemon and a dish 
of table salt. Just dip the lemon into the salt and rub the marble. Thoroughly 
rinse with fresh water and towel-dry. You’ll be amazed by how well it works. 
(If you can’t get your marble clean with this trick, you probably won’t get it 
clean at all.)

264
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
 
Sealer goes a long way toward preventing damage. Choose a high-quality, food-
grade sealer, and apply it (and reapply it periodically) exactly according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. You can find a marble sealer at most hardware 
stores, home centers, or marble fabrication shops.
Caring for Granite
Granite is one of the hardest stones. In our opinion, there is no surface that is 
as durable or as easy to maintain as granite. Ten years later, it shines as beau-
tifully as the day it was installed.
All it takes to remove coffee or tea stains from granite is some warm water on 
a cloth or paper towel. Hot pots have no effect on granite, and cold granite is 
an absolutely perfect baker’s surface.
To maintain your granite, simply do the following:
 
✓ Keep it clean by wiping with a damp cloth. Easy enough.
 
✓ Apply a clear, penetrating sealer with a clean, soft, cotton cloth at 
least once a year (twice a year for kitchen counters). The sealer pre-
vents cooking oils, grease, and other materials from being absorbed into 
the granite; these substances can cause discoloration and act as a hiding 
place for bacteria.
You can find a granite sealer at most hardware stores, home centers, or gran-
ite fabrication shops.
Taking Care of Wonderful 
Wood Chopping Blocks
People who love to cook love an in-counter butcher block. Heck, anyone who 
ever chops an onion likes the convenience of a solid, stable cutting surface. 
Care of this surface is simple:
 
✓ Clean with a soapy, damp cloth; then remove soapy residue with a 
clean, damp cloth.
 
✓ Remove stains immediately. Remove light stains by scrubbing the area 
with half a lemon and some salt. Also, try simply applying lemon juice 
to the area and letting it sit for a minute or two. You can remove tough 

265
 Chapter 13: Cabinets and Countertops
stains by applying a 3 percent solution of hydrogen peroxide and water. 
If that doesn’t work, bring out the big gun — a 50 percent solution of 
bleach and water. Brush it on and allow it to work for 15 minutes. Rinse 
the area thoroughly. Never, ever, ever use a scouring cleanser on a 
butcher block.
 
✓ Prevent swelling, shrinking, and warping by not flooding the surface 
with water or letting water stand on the surface.
 
✓ Maintain a smooth surface by sanding out scratches and cuts with 100-
grit sandpaper. (Use a sanding block.) Sand with the grain of the wood.
 
✓ Protect and preserve the surface by applying mineral oil (not vegetable 
oil or olive oil) monthly. Apply the oil with a soft cloth, rubbing with the 
grain. Allow the oil to soak in and then wipe off excess oil.
 
 Unlike vegetable-based oils, mineral oil doesn’t go rancid, and it doesn’t 
mess up polyurethane or varnish. Mineral oil also helps prevent the 
wood from drying out and cracking or literally coming apart at the 
seams.

In This Chapter
▶ Using natural gas and electricity in the home
▶ Cleaning to extend the life span of your appliances
T
he kitchen is the entertainment hub of most homes. If you doubt this, 
just throw (or go to) a party — and watch where everyone congregates. 
The nicer and more inviting the kitchen, the more crowded it is. The sleek, 
beautiful appliances you find in the kitchen certainly add to the attraction.
In this chapter, we offer you specific tips and ideas for the safe operation, 
maintenance and longevity of the incredible array of marvelous and inge-
nious conveniences that make the kitchen the heart of the 21st-century 
home. We also take a look at the washing machine and dryer, two appliances 
that make life easier.
Note: For parts of this chapter, we sought the sage advice of our favorite 
appliance guru, Otto “Butch” Gross of Middletown, Maryland. Butch often 
appears as our appliance expert in our newspaper columns and visits our 
radio broadcasts from time to time — thus, he is nationally known as the 
lovable, all-knowing “Appliance MD.”
Safety First
When it comes to maintaining and repairing appliances, you must respect 
the power of, and potential danger posed by, the natural gas in the pipe and 
the electricity in the wires. Always use extreme care when working inside 
any appliance. In the following sections, we give you the most important 
safety information you need when it comes to gas- and electricity-powered 
appliances.

The owner’s manuals for your major appliances are filled with valuable infor-
mation for day-to-day operation and preventive maintenance. If you can’t 
locate a manual, contact the manufacturer and ask the customer-service 
department to send you one. (Some manufacturers allow you to download 
product manuals from their Web sites.) After you assemble a full set of manu-
als for every major appliance in your home, keep them in a safe place for easy 
reference. They’ll also be invaluable to someone else who may purchase your 
home somewhere down the line.
Cleaning is job one
The life span of most major household appli-
ances can be severely shortened by neglect, 
and, on the flip side, greatly prolonged by 
simple care and basic preventive maintenance. 
And that maintenance mostly centers on, you 
guessed it, cleaning. Fortunately, a few simple 
household ingredients, plus a little elbow 
grease from time to time, will keep your appli-
ances sparkling, operating efficiently, and one 
step ahead of the repairman.
When it comes to choosing a cleaner to use 
for the different tasks, you basically have two 
choices:
 ✓ You can use commercial cleaners. If you 
do, make sure they’re mild and nonabrasive; 
harsh cleaners can damage the glossy sur-
faces you’re trying to clean and preserve.
 ✓ You can use easy-to-make, non-caustic, 
homemade cleaning solutions. You’ll be 
surprised by how powerful simple dish-
washing soap, baking soda, vinegar, lemon 
juice, and salt can be — and how much 
better than chemical cleaners they are 
for you, your appliances, and your home 
environment. (Chapter 20 shares our secret 
family formulas.)
Regardless of the cleaner you use, keep these 
points in mind:
 ✓ All cleaners work best when left to sit for a 
while. Generally, the tougher the stain, the 
longer you let it sit to work.
 ✓ If you’re using commercial cleaners and 
solvents, always read the label for the 
manufacturer’s usage directions and spe-
cial warnings. These warnings can range 
from potential health hazards to potential 
discoloration and surface damage.
 ✓ Always wear rubber gloves, protect your 
eyes with glasses or goggles, and have 
plenty of ventilation when using any type of 
cleaner — whether store-bought or home-
made. Even though our homemade cleaning 
solutions are made with natural products, 
they still contain mild acids that can sting 
and burn your eyes and skin. Commercial 
products can be even more dangerous and 
highly volatile due to caustic components 
and chemical ingredients that can sting, 
burn, and give off vapors.

269
 Chapter 14: Appliances
Gas appliances
Natural gas has no odor itself. A heavy smell is added to the gas for one pur-
pose: to make it easy to detect even the smallest gas leak. If you smell gas, 
move quickly: Open all the doors and windows, and leave immediately. If the 
range shut-off valve isn’t within easy reach, turn off the main shut-off valve at 
your gas meter. (See Chapter 16 for information on how to turn off the main 
shut-off valve at your gas meter.)
 
Don’t use the phone or flip a light switch. Even the tiniest spark can ignite a 
massive explosion. From a neighbor’s home, call the gas company and the fire 
department.
Electric appliances
With electricity, the major danger is electric shock. (Duh!) If you ever hear 
a funny zzzzzap! sound, or a weird pwok!, followed by a burnt, ozone smell, 
you’ve got a problem. Something inside your appliance is sparking or arcing 
(electrical shorting). Unplug the appliance immediately and call a repairman.
 
At this point, anything you do will be dangerous, so stop and call a professional.
Caring for the Cooktop
Cooking can be messy. Splatters, drips, boil-overs, and spills happen. And as 
a result, the cooktops in many homes (including yours?) have burnt-on food, 
hardened mystery globs, and a few thoroughly blackened rigatoni under the 
burners. In this section, we give you detailed information on cleaning and 
maintaining your cooktop.
Cleaning up the cooking crud
For day-to-day surface cleaning of the range or cooktop, a wet, wrung-out 
cloth or sponge will do the job — if you wipe up spills immediately after the 
meal. If you don’t get to a spill right away, a general, all-purpose cleaner, like 
our All-Purpose, Handy-Dandy Cleaner (see Chapter 20), will cut through the 

270
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
crud. For tougher cooked-on spills, you need a cleanser with a little more 
oomph, like our DIY Cleanser Scrub (see Chapter 20) or a commercial cleaner 
that cuts through grease. Let the cleaners sit for a while to soften those really 
tough stains and hardened spills.
 
No matter how burnt on, dried up, or crusty your cooking crud gets, never, 
ever, ever use an abrasive cleaner. You’ll scratch the glossy surface, and it’ll 
look lousy forever.
 
When food spills occur, immediately sprinkle them with table salt, which 
absorbs the moisture and makes them easy to clean up later when the stove 
top cools.
Whatever cleaner you use, do a thorough job. Look for nooks and crannies 
where crud and crumbs gather. Make sure you remove that grease film from 
all glossy or shiny surfaces. (You can use full-strength white vinegar or lemon 
juice for that.) Remember to wipe off the burner elements (when cool) and 
the grates. Heck, put the grates in the dishwasher every now and then. And 
don’t forget the knobs! Pull them off and wash them in warm, soapy water. 
Air-dry the knobs thoroughly and completely before replacing them. Use a 
hair dryer to remove moisture from nooks and crannies, if necessary.
Maintaining your electric 
range and cooktop
There are several kinds of electric ranges and cooktops, and what you can 
repair and replace depends on the type you have. Here are the three types of 
electric ranges and cooktops:
 
✓ Plug-in burners: Most electric ranges and cooktops have plug-in burn-
ers, which have a tendency to collect grease and moisture down at the 
tips where they go into the power receptacle. This buildup leads to 
minor arcing that slowly builds and eventually ruins the burners. To 
prevent this problem, remove the plug-in burners and carefully clean the 
surfaces and tips with a damp rag or stiff nylon brush. If those don’t do 
the trick, use a soapy steel-wool pad.
 
 Never fully submerse plug-in burners in water. Even though the metal 
prongs may appear to be fully dry, trace amounts of moisture usually 
remain on the plug-in tips and electric receptacles, which contain porce-
lain, an extremely porous material that absorbs water. The result: You’ve 
brought water and electricity together for a potential electric shock — 
and a serious zapping.

271
 Chapter 14: Appliances
 
 Most ranges have two 6-inch and two 8-inch interchangeable burners. 
When removing them for cleaning, always mark their origin so you can 
put them back in exactly the same receptacle.
 
✓ Fixed-unit burners: Another kind of electric burner, the fixed unit, 
is hard-wired and generally lifts up for cleaning underneath. The advan-
tage to this type of burner is that the tips never corrode or burn out 
from dripping grease, so you don’t need to concern yourself with that 
possibility.
 
✓ Euro-style cast-iron burners: The coating on Euro-style solid cast iron 
burners (also called hobs) wears off with use. To prevent rusting, manu-
facturers and dealers offer a special cleaner/sealer that you apply to a 
cold burner (it burns off when the burner heats). You can also use a light 
coat of mineral oil or cooking oil to prevent rusting, but oil smokes a bit 
when the burner heats. Turn on the vent fan to remove any light residual 
smoking or burning odor.
 
Always keep lightweight, inexpensive aluminum drip pans under the heating 
elements to prevent grease, liquids, and burned pasta from getting into the 
works of the range. Besides keeping a spill from shorting the burners, they 
also increase the efficiency of the burner by reflecting heat upward. (That’s 
why they’re shiny!)
Clean the drip pans using baking soda, rather than soap, to keep them reflec-
tive. Don’t use an abrasive cleaner — you’ll create a billion little scratches. 
Also, never line your drip pans with aluminum foil. The heat reflected off the 
shiny-but-wrinkly foil creates hot spots underneath a burner that will quickly 
end the useful life of an electric element.
Keeping your gas range and 
cooktop in tip-top shape
Gas burners need a little TLC, too. Very little. Cleaning and maintenance 
is easy — and much safer than cleaning and maintaining electric burners, 
because you don’t have to deal with electricity.
Cleaning removable gas burners
Take out removable gas burners periodically, and clean them with a stiff 
nylon brush, using baking soda and hot water to keep the ports (gas jet holes) 
clean. You can remove most burners simply by lifting them out of the open-
ing in the cooktop; you don’t need any tools. If you aren’t sure whether your 
burners are the removable type, refer to your owner’s manual.

272
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
 
Never use any kind of soap or put your removable gas burners in the dish-
washer. The chemicals in soap and dishwasher detergent trigger corrosion on 
burner housings, which are made of aluminum.
Cleaning nonremovable sealed gas burners
You’ll know if you have a sealed gas burner — the drip pan that surrounds 
each burner is anchored securely to the cooktop, or the cooktop is one big 
piece with indentations surrounding the burners For these types of burners, 
the only components that can be removed for cleaning are the burner cap 
(which evenly distributes the flame) and the burner grate (the part that rests 
above the flame, on which you put the pots). Both just lift off.
Clean the burner caps with a small brush and a solution of 1/4 cup of baking 
soda and 1 quart of warm water. Be sure to thoroughly wipe the burner caps 
clean, and remove all water from the gas jet port openings — first with a soft 
cloth, and then using a hair dryer to remove all moisture, if necessary. You’ll 
need to up the ante when it comes to cleaning burner grates. Use an all-purpose 
cleanser scrub (like our DIY Cleanser Scrub — see Chapter 20) to clean these 
components.
Cleaning the connector tube
Between the burners is a connector tube (technically called a flash tube) 
with an opening and a pilot light or electric spark igniter. This tube is where 
the gas is actually ignited and carried or drawn to each burner. If you notice 
that one flame jet shoots farther out than the others, the opening is partially 
blocked and needs cleaning. In most cases, this configuration is part of the 
burner assembly and can be cleaned the same way the burners are (see the 
preceding sections).
 
A proper gas flame burns clear and blue. If yours burns yellow and orange, it 
probably is starved for air. The burners should be cleaned with a wire brush.
Opening the Door and Rolling 
Up Your Sleeves: The Oven
Whether your oven is gas- or electric-powered, it’s going to get dirty. Really 
dirty. That’s just how it is. And cleaning your oven will be a drag, so just take 
a deep breath, roll up your sleeves, and do the job right. In this section, we 
tell you how. We also fill you in on two other oven maintenance tasks: check-
ing the temperature control and replacing the oven light.

273
 Chapter 14: Appliances
Cleaning your oven
Aside from saving you embarrassment when company comes calling, a clean 
oven operates more efficiently by providing more even heating. A dirty oven 
can also prevent the door from sealing properly, which allows heat and 
smoke to escape.
The interior
You can clean oven interiors with commercial cleansers, steel-wool soap 
pads, or our People-Friendly Oven Cleaner (see Chapter 20). (Note: Don’t use 
commercial cleaners on self-cleaning ovens; see the “Self-cleaning ovens” 
bullet, toward the end of this section, for details.)
 
Here are a couple of tips to make oven cleaning easier:
 
✓ To loosen up tough, baked-on spills, preheat the oven to 200 degrees, 
turn off the heat, and then put a bowl of ammonia in your oven over-
night. This strategy works well as long as you don’t mind the smell of 
ammonia in your kitchen the next day.
 
✓ To make it easier to reach all the way into the oven, open the door 8 
to 10 inches and try lifting the door up and out. Most ovens have spe-
cial hinges that allow the door to lift right off. You can then easily clean 
deep into the oven interior without stretching over the lowered, open 
oven door. You also can comfortably clean the glass and inside surface 
of the door on top of a towel spread out on the countertop.
 
If a commercial cleaner says you must wear rubber gloves and avoid breath-
ing fumes, it’s probably very caustic and possibly toxic. It may give off harmful 
gases even after the cleaning is complete and the oven is again heated for use. 
Thus, we suggest that you avoid using commercial oven cleaners whenever pos-
sible. If you must use a commercial cleaner, follow label directions to the letter.
 
If the wire oven racks are severely caked with food spills, put them in a plastic 
trash bag, add some ammonia, and seal the bag well with a twist tie. Leave the 
bag outside overnight, and then either hose the racks off, hand-wash them, or 
run them through your dishwasher.
Here are some specific tips for the various types of ovens:
 
✓ Electric ovens: In electric ovens, you find two heating elements: one for 
broiling (above) and one for baking (below). In some models you can lift 
the bottom bake element for easier cleaning of the bottom of the oven. 
(If you’re in the market for an oven, look for this handy feature.)

274
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
 
 Many people believe that they can simplify oven cleaning by lining the 
bottom of their electric oven with aluminum foil to catch spills. This is 
a no-no! A layer of foil causes an electric oven to heat unevenly. It also 
shortens the life of the element by causing it to superheat in certain 
locations.
 
✓ Gas ovens: Like most ovens, the bottom of the gas oven is the object of 
most cleaning attention. Remove the bottom panel of a gas oven by lift-
ing it out or by removing a couple of screws that hold it in place. Doing 
so lets you work on it in a deep sink or bathtub. It also enables you to 
inspect and clean the gas burner.
 
 Over time, the bottom panel of a gas oven can become corroded or 
cracked. If this happens, you can replace it. Just get the proper part 
from the manufacturer or your local appliance parts dealer. Remove the 
old piece, and put in the new piece. Voilà!
 
 Uneven heating, poor baking, or an odor of gas when the oven is on are 
telltale signs of a clogged burner. Your best bet to determine how the 
burner is working is to turn it on with the bottom panel off. If the flame 
isn’t continuous along both sides of the burner, some of its holes are 
likely clogged. To set your burner free, turn off the oven control and 
carefully use a wire — such as a coat hanger — to unclog the clogged 
holes. Works every time!
 
 After the gas burner is clean, check to make sure that it’s burning 
efficiently — with a steady, blue, 1-inch cone, with an inner lighter-blue 
cone of about 1/2 inch. Adjusting the air shutter controls the air mixture 
and, in turn, the color of the flame. Consult your owner’s manual for spe-
cific information on how to adjust the burner flame in your gas oven.
 
✓ Self-cleaning ovens: Never, never, never use commercial oven cleaners 
on a self-cleaning oven. They can pit, burn, and eat into the special 
porcelain surface. The result? When you reach the normal 850- to 
900-degree level for self-cleaning, you can actually pop chunks of por-
celain as large as 6 inches across off the oven walls. Instead, let the 
intended high-heat action turn food spills into carbon, which all but 
disappears with complete combustion, and then wipe up any minor 
dust-like ash residue with a damp cloth, paper towel, or sponge when 
the oven cools.
 
 Manufacturers recommend removing the racks during the self-cleaning 
process to prevent them from turning brown. To clean these racks, use 
the process mentioned earlier in this section. (We strongly recommend 
that you consult your owner’s manual for specific information on how to 
use your self-cleaning oven.)
 
 When using the self-cleaning feature, don’t open the oven door if you 
notice a flame-up or smell something burning. The oven is just doing 
what it’s supposed to do. If you’re really worried, just shut the oven off. 

275
 Chapter 14: Appliances
The lack of oxygen in the closed and sealed oven and diminishing heat 
level extinguish any burning in a matter of minutes.
 
 You can clean the area surrounding the oven door gasket with any type 
of mild abrasive, such as our DIY Cleanser Scrub (see Chapter 20) or a 
commercial silver polish. Use a wide spatula or paint scraper to lift the 
gasket edge up to prevent rubbing up against it and possible fraying.
 
 Many heavier-weight, porcelain-coated drip pans can be put into the 
oven during self-cleaning, making the cleanup of drips and spills a snap.
 
✓ Continuous-cleaning ovens: These ovens have a special rough-texture 
porcelain interior. Spills gradually burn off as you use the oven. A speck-
led surface helps hide foods while they burn off, but these ovens may 
not always look clean in the process.
 
 Combusted foods tend to remain on the oven walls. To avoid this situ-
ation as much as possible, always wipe up large spills — especially 
sugary or starchy foods — as soon as the oven cools. These models 
work best on greasy spills.
 
 Never use harsh abrasives, scouring pads or commercial oven cleaners 
on continuous-cleaning ovens. These cleaners damage the special lining. 
Gentle cleaning by hand with baking soda and warm water works best.
The window glass
Ammonia and commercial window cleaners that contain ammonia are great 
for cleaning browned and discolored, oven window glass. You can also use 
mild abrasives and scouring pads for tough spots.
Behind the range
Occasionally you may want to clean and vacuum the back of your range and 
the areas behind, on either side of, and below it. On the back of a range is a 
metal panel that can be removed (by a professional) for service or repair. You 
can clean dust and grime off this panel, but don’t remove it.
To clean behind the range, pull it away from the wall. If the range is electric, 
the cord should be long enough for you to move the appliance out and then 
unplug it. Gas models should have a flexible gas line that enables you to pull 
out the appliance.
 
Don’t move a gas range that has a rigid gas pipe — instead, call a service 
professional.
 
To avoid damaging flooring in front of an appliance when moving it, turn an 
old piece of carpet upside down and place it under the appliance, or use an 
appliance dolly or an appliance skid pad (both available from an appliance 
service company).

276
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
Checking the oven temperature control
A poorly calibrated control can make it virtually impossible to conform to 
heating instructions on recipes. Thus, you end up with a dish that is either 
under- or overcooked. Yikes!
To check the accuracy of oven temperature control, put an oven thermom-
eter on the middle rack. Set the thermometer for 350 degrees and heat the 
oven for 20 minutes. Write down the temperature. Check three more times 
at ten-minute intervals, noting the temperatures. The average temperature 
should be within 25 degrees of 350.
If you find that the temperature is off, recalibrate the temperature control dial 
by removing the oven temperature knob and doing one of the following:
 
✓ Loosen the screws and turn the movable disk on the backside. One 
notch represents 10 degrees.
 
✓ Turn the adjustment screw inside the hollow shaft clockwise to lower 
the temperature, counterclockwise to raise it. If it requires more than an 
eighth of a turn or is off by 50 degrees or more, have a new temperature 
control installed by a qualified professional.
If after you’ve recalibrated the temperature control, your oven still fluctuates 
or bakes unevenly, chances are good that your thermostat is faulty. Your best 
bet is to leave thermostat installation to a pro. The only tool you should pick 
up to make this repair is your phone.
Replacing the oven light
When the oven light burns out, turn off the power at the main circuit, remove 
the glass shield and, using gloves or a dry cloth, unscrew the old bulb. Only 
replace it with a special 40-watt appliance bulb that can stand extreme 
temperatures (or whatever the manufacturer recommends). If, after you’ve 
replaced the bulb, the light doesn’t light, it may indicate a larger problem 
that needs professional attention.
Hanging Out in the Range Hood
Although it’s a simple appliance, the range hood has an important job: It 
removes excess moisture and smoke produced by cooking. The most impor-
tant range-hood maintenance task is cleaning.

277
 Chapter 14: Appliances
Remove and clean the metal mesh filter(s) that keep grease from getting 
into the ductwork. Soak the filters in a sink full of hot water and liquid dish 
detergent. Then rinse them clean with very hot water. At least once a month 
(more often if you cook and operate the vent and fan frequently), inspect 
the filters for grease buildup. Replace worn or damaged filter screens with 
new ones; you can get them from an appliance repair shop or through the 
manufacturer.
 
Don’t put mesh filters in the bottom rack of your dishwasher (regardless 
of what amateur tipsters advise). The filters may leave a greasy residue 
behind in your dishwasher that’s hard to remove and can ultimately clog 
lines and affect your machine’s operation. You can put them in the dishwasher 
after you’ve given them an initial once-over as outlined in the preceding 
paragraph.
With filters removed, wash the range-hood interior with an all-purpose 
cleaner (our All-Purpose, Handy-Dandy Cleaner [see Chapter 20] is good for 
this job), or try warm water and liquid dish detergent.
 
For non-vented hoods, remember to replace the disposable charcoal filter 
every year (or according to the manufacturer’s directions).
Microwave Maintenance Mania
When it comes to a microwave oven, you can do only a few things safely. 
Basically, your job is to keep it clean, use it properly, and call a pro when it 
begins to act up.
Here’s why keeping the inside of your microwave clean is so important: 
Stuck-on food particles eventually turn to carbon and cause arcing, which, in 
turn, can etch interior surfaces and could even compromise the seal around 
the door. Always wipe up spills promptly. Keep the interior of the oven and 
the area surrounding the door clean, using a damp sponge to catch spills 
and splatters as they occur, or an all-purpose cleaning solution for spills that 
have been left over long periods of time.
 
Never use a microwave oven for anything other than what it was designed 
for — cooking and heating. Using it to dry clothing, newspapers, or shoes 
can yield devastating results. Never run an empty microwave, and always be 
sure there is plenty of ventilation surrounding the unit to avoid overheating, 
which could cause serious damage. And only use microwave-approved con-
tainers and dishes.

278
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
 
Never attempt to repair an ailing microwave oven yourself. Besides the 
inherent dangers (the unit’s capacitor holds up to 4,000 volts of electricity!), 
unauthorized repairs by anyone other than an authorized service tech almost 
always void the manufacturer’s warranty. Here are some problems that require 
the attention of a professional:
 
✓ Insufficient output: If your microwave oven is more than 15 years old, 
check it for output efficiency. For 600- to 1,000-watt microwave ovens, 
place an 8-ounce cup of water in the oven and operate the unit on high 
for three minutes. The water should reach a rolling boil. If not, take the 
microwave to a service shop for inspection.
 
✓ Radiation leaks: Have a professional appliance-repair technician test 
your older microwave for radiation leakage. In addition, the pro can 
check other aspects of operation to determine if the microwave is safe 
and whether it should be repaired or replaced.
 
✓ Poor heating: Operating a microwave on a circuit that is serving other 
appliances not only diminishes the effectiveness of the microwave oven, 
but ultimately could result in an electrical fire. If lights dim when the 
microwave is used, consult an electrician. Whenever possible, a sepa-
rate electrical circuit should be provided for the microwave oven.
 
✓ Burned out interior fuse: Appliance repair pros say the most common 
repair problem they find is a simple microwave fuse that gets metal 
fatigue after three or four years’ use. At that point, even a minor power 
surge can cause the fuse to burn out. If your microwave quits, don’t 
panic. It may just be an interior fuse that needs replacing by a pro.
Dishwashers
The single most important dishwasher maintenance task? Easy! Keep the 
interior clean. Doing so keeps all the hoses and passages clear, which, in turn, 
lets the machine operate freely and washes your dishes better.
The best way to clean the interior is with citric acid. Use pure citric-acid crys-
tals, which you can find in grocery stores and drugstores. Fill your main soap 
cup and then run the empty dishwasher through a complete cycle. The crys-
tals clean everything, including the unit’s interior, racks, hoses, and water 
ports. Then, once a week, add 1 teaspoon of the acid crystals to your soap 
for general maintenance.
 
You can substitute Tang and lemonade mixes that contain vitamin C (which is 
citric acid) for the crystals. They work well, but with less citric acid per dose.

279
 Chapter 14: Appliances
 
Here are some other tasks you can do to keep your dishwasher washing dishes:
 
✓ Use the right amount of soap. Any more than 1 tablespoon is too much 
and will lead to a residue buildup that’s hard to remove.
 
✓ Never wash anything other than dishes in your dishwasher. Tools, 
clothes, sneakers, greasy range hood filters, and other “unauthorized” 
items can leave harmful grease and residue that clog the machine’s 
works and inhibit proper operation.
 
✓ Run your dishwasher at least once a week. This keeps all the seals 
moist and prevents leaks and eventual failure.
 
✓ Periodically wipe the area around the seals. This prevents soap scum 
buildup, which can cause a leak.
Refrigerators and Freezers
Refrigerators are big, and they have many components to keep clean. You’ve 
got the exterior, the interior, the freezer, water lines, drain lines, and coils to 
worry about. Not that the maintenance they require is difficult — you just 
have to stay on top it to make sure the fridge does a good job of keeping 
everything cold.
 
Temperature-wise, keep the food compartment set between 34 and 40 degrees, 
and the freezer compartment at about 0 degrees. Generally, refrigerator and 
freezer controls should always be set midway initially, and then adjusted up or 
down as needed.
Taking care of the condenser coils
The most important thing for any refrigerator is to keep the condenser coils 
clean. The coils are usually located at the bottom of the refrigerator behind 
a removable grille; on some older refrigerators, they’re located on the back 
of the refrigerator. Air passing over these coils is what cools the refrigerator, 
and if they’re dirty, the unit has to work harder to do its job.
To clean the coils, first unplug the refrigerator. Remove the grille by grabbing 
both ends and pulling gently. Use a vacuum cleaner with a brush or crevice 
attachment to get as far into and under the unit as possible (being careful not 
to force access, which can bend condenser tubing and the thin metal coil fins). 
While the grille is off, also remove the refrigerator drain pan and wash it.

280
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
 
Typically located inside your refrigerator is an electric heater power switch. 
It controls small electric heaters that keep the outside of the cabinet from 
sweating. Only turn the switch on when it’s humid and you see moisture beads. 
When both the weather and your refrigerator are dry, turn this switch off to save 
energy costs. The electric heater also helps prevent rust and nasty mold buildup.
Cleaning the gasket
The chilled air inside a refrigerator is kept there primarily by a gasket at the 
perimeter of the door. In good condition, it provides a good airtight seal. 
It can get tired and worn, or hard, and also is a prime candidate for mold. 
Here’s how to take care of it:
 
✓ Every six months or so, check the gasket to make sure it’s in good con-
dition. How can you tell if your gasket is in good condition? Place a dollar 
bill between the gasket and the door jamb. If it’s difficult to pull out, the 
gasket is okay. If it pulls out easily, you need to replace the gasket.
 
✓ Wipe the gasket every few months with a wet cloth, making sure to 
get all the surfaces and to go completely around the door. If the gasket 
seems a bit hard, apply a light coat of lemon oil, mineral oil, or any type 
of body lotion with lanolin.
 
✓ As soon as you notice any mold around the gasket, remove it. To do 
so, clean it with a solution of liquid chlorine bleach and water (4 table-
spoons of bleach in 1 quart of hot water), and scrub well with an old 
toothbrush. Afterwards, completely wipe off all residue with warm water 
and a mild, liquid dish soap.
 
✓ Always wipe off any food or liquid spills, drips, and runs from around 
the door and gaskets. If you don’t, they dry and become sticky, possibly 
ripping away the gasket when you open the door.
 
✓ If the gasket has pulled away in spots, stick it back down with a little 
contact cement. Use a Popsicle stick to neatly smear a small blob of 
glue into the gap and hold it in place for 10 seconds. Then close the 
door. Make sure there is nothing sticky where the gasket meets the 
refrigerator — otherwise, your work will be in vain.
Keeping the interior clean 
and fresh-smelling
To clean the interior of the refrigerator, first turn off the fridge (or unplug it) 
and remove all the food. Wash removable shelves and bins in the sink with 
liquid dish detergent and warm water. Wipe down the interior walls with an 
all-purpose cleanser or a solution of warm water and baking soda.

281
 Chapter 14: Appliances
 
Most people know that an open box of baking soda will keep the refrigerator 
or freezer smelling fresh. Did you know that you can also use a small bowl 
with a few tablespoons of instant freeze-dried coffee crystals in it? And believe 
it or not, granulated cat litter also works. An added bonus: The litter elimi-
nates food odors in ice cubes.
Defrosting the freezer and drain line
Defrost your freezer when ice begins to build up on the interior. Aside from 
decreasing usable freezer space, the ice can prevent the door from sealing 
properly. Most freezers need to be defrosted at least once and sometimes twice 
each year. Start by turning off the power to the freezer and removing all the 
contents. You can allow the ice to melt on its own or you can speed things up 
by placing a pot of hot water in the freezer and closing the door. Clean the inte-
rior of the freezer using the same method described for cleaning the interior.
While you’re defrosting the freezer, defrost the freezer drain line leading to 
the drain pan, too. (This task needs to be done at least once a year.) Mold 
buildup starts retaining moisture, which, in turn, starts freezing and ulti-
mately completely blocks the line. Here’s how to defrost the drain line:
 
1. Turn off the freezer (so that you can melt the ice in the drain line).
 
2. Put very hot water into a turkey baster and insert it into the 1/2-inch 
drain hole located at the back of the freezer floor.
 
3. Release the hot water into the line until it runs free.
Garbage disposals
To keep your garbage disposal in good working 
order, keep it clean: Put ice cubes and 1/4 cup of 
white vinegar into the unit and operate it with no 
running water. When it sounds like the cubes are 
all gone, start a slow trickle of cold water. You’ll 
probably find that the disposal’s drain open-
ings are frozen and clogged with ice, and the 
water will start to back up — which is good — 
because the churning water also washes the 
sides before the ice melts, the drain clears, and 
everything drains away. For a more thorough 
cleaning, sprinkle some baking soda on top of 
the ice cubes. To make the disposal smell fresh, 
add some citric-acid crystals, Tang, or a drink 
mix containing vitamin C, or half a lemon.
Use vinegar ice cubes as an easy means of 
cleaning your disposal and sharpening its 
blades. Pour 1 cup of vinegar into an empty ice-
cube tray, fill the balance of the tray with water, 
and freeze until solid. Periodically pour an 
entire tray of ice cubes into the disposal while 
it’s running. Just be sure to mark the tray with 
the vinegar ice cubes; otherwise, your guests 
will have an unpleasant experience next time 
you serve them a cold beverage!

4. Blast in more hot water to blow out any mold buildup.
 
5. Put 2 tablespoons of chlorine bleach in 1 cup of hot water and pour it 
down the drain to kill off any remaining mold spores.
All this liquid should be running into the drain pan at the bottom of the unit. 
Make sure it doesn’t overflow, and empty and clean the drain pan when 
you’re done.
Maintaining inline water filtration
Many, if not most, refrigerators offer automatic ice makers and water dispens-
ers. A filter somewhere under the unit ensures clean ice and water. Typically, 
the only maintenance required is periodically changing the filter. Many units 
even have a red-light/green-light alert to tell you when the filter needs to be 
replaced. You can order the filters from the manufacturer, get them at an 
appliance parts dealer, and may even find them at your home center or the 
retailer that sold the unit. Consult your owner’s manual to get step-by-step 
filter-replacement instructions.
Washing Machines and Dryers
People tend to take their washing machines and dryers for granted — until 
they stop working in the middle of a load. You’d be amazed by all the technol-
ogy inside your washer and dryer — in fact, so much technology is involved 
that you can’t service many components yourself. Having to call a profes-
sional is okay, though — after all, the true battle for laundry-machine longev-
ity is fought with basic cleaning and simple maintenance, and you can do all 
of that yourself.
Cleaning your washing machine
Over time and multiple wash loads, mineral deposits, lime, and soap build 
up inside your washer and can affect the pump operation. You can avoid 
this buildup by using citric-acid crystals to clean tub interiors. With the tub 
empty, use 1 cup of citric acid instead of laundry detergent, and run your 
machine through a complete cycle. (Refer to the “Dishwashers” section, ear-
lier in this chapter, for more on this cleaning method.)

283
 Chapter 14: Appliances
Here are other problems that you can fix with just a few tools and a little 
know-how (or a quick call to a professional):
 
✓ Rust stains inside the tub: Temporary patch-ups on small nicks in the 
porcelain where rusting occurs can be made with a dab or two of enamel 
paint or clear nail polish — but these solutions are only temporary, at 
best. A better solution is a porcelain repair kit made for bathtubs, avail-
able at your local hardware store. It lasts longer, but not forever. If these 
fixes aren’t sufficient, before you consider replacing your machine, try a 
professionally installed plastic tub liner.
 
✓ Lint-filled drain line: If your water outlet hose drains into a laundry 
basin rather than a stand pipe, cover the end with an old nylon stock-
ing. Doing so collects 95 percent of all lint that otherwise would go into 
your sink’s drain line. The nylon stocking filter also reduces splashing 
when the washer empties into the sink. When the stocking fills with lint, 
remove and replace it.
 
✓ Slow-running cold water: Turn off the water inlet valves, remove the 
water hoses, and clean the small screen filters, which probably are 
clogged with mineral buildup and small debris. The fine mesh filters 
are usually at either end of the hose or on the back of the washing 
machine’s water inlet port. If debris gets past these screen filters, it can 
damage the pump and lead to a costly repair. Also, consider switching 
from rubber water inlet hoses to long-lasting braided stainless-steel 
hoses. They cost a little more, but both are good insurance against 
flooding caused by hose failure.
Keeping your dryer’s lint traps lint free
Dryer lint is a big fire hazard. Plus, excess lint in the trap makes the dryer 
work extra hard, causing it to take forever to dry a load of clothes. To keep 
your lint traps lint free, do the following:
 
✓ Clean the lint screen thoroughly after every load. If it’s clogged with 
lint, the air won’t circulate, the clothes won’t dry, and the dryer will run 
far longer, which wears it out faster and wastes lots of energy dollars in 
the process.
 
✓ Clean the dryer duct at least twice each year. The easiest way to clean 
a short dryer duct is to use a dryer-duct cleaning brush (a stiff-bristle cir-
cular brush attached to a flexible handle — it looks like a mini version of 
a brush that a chimney sweep might use) and a vacuum. Move the brush 

284
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
back and forth inside the duct to dislodge any lint, and vacuum out the 
loose debris.
 
✓ Remove lint that accumulates at the bottom of the housing that con-
tains the lint screen. Construct a mini vacuum hose attachment using 
a short piece of rubber hose, the cap to an aerosol can, and some duct 
tape. The cap acts as an adapter that fits over the end of a wet/dry 
vacuum hose. Make a hole in the center of the cap the size of the outside 
diameter of the hose. Insert the hose snuggly into the hole and attach 
the two with duct tape. Attach the cap to the end of a wet/dry vacuum 
and insert the hose into the filter housing until it reaches the bottom 
(see Figure 14-1).
Taking care of the dryer vent
The dryer vent transports hot, damp air from the dryer to the outside of your 
house. Without it, your house would be very hot, excessively humid, and cov-
ered in a light coating of lint. The problem: All dryer vents slowly fill with lint, 
which impedes or blocks airflow (making the dryer inefficient) and creates a 
significant fire hazard. A couple of times a year, take a few minutes to clean 
the dryer vent. A clean vent is a happy vent.
 
Figure 14-1: 
Removing

285
 Chapter 14: Appliances
The easiest way to clean a dryer vent is with a dryer vent brush. It’s the mini 
version of a chimney-sweep brush and has a round brush at one end with 
a flexible handle that can makes negotiating curves a breeze. You can find 
these brushes at most hardware stores. Use it in combination with a vacuum, 
and your vent will be lint free!
In addition to cleaning the dryer vent, periodically remove the flexible accor-
dion-type exhaust hose (located between the back of the dryer and the vent 
at the wall or floor) and vacuum it. Better yet, don’t bother cleaning the flex-
ible vent (especially if it’s vinyl). Throw it away, and replace it with a metal 
duct. It won’t clog nearly as much, and it’s a more efficient vent, making your 
clothes dry faster.
Not all dryer manufacturers approve the use of plastic flexible hose for venting. 
In fact, installing one may void the warranty. A smooth, metal vent is best. The 
pleats on flexible hoses (metal or plastic) create air turbulence, which results in 
decreased airflow. Plus, moisture collects in the pleats, attracting and holding lint.
Keeping the dryer duct 
free from obstruction
Most dryer ducts terminate at a hood mounted at an exterior wall. The hood 
contains a damper designed to open only when the dryer is blowing air 
through the duct. The damper prevents cold air and birds and rodents from 
nesting in the duct. However, crafty varmints often find a way of breaching 
the damper. If you’ve experienced such a problem, install a protective screen 
specially designed to solve this problem. If you already have such a device, 
make sure that any holes are patched so that it’s doing a good job.
Mysterious dryer death: 
Knowing what to do
If you suddenly have a dead electric dryer, it may have burned its fuse — a 
totally fixable problem and much cheaper than a new unit. The fuse is a built-
in safety mechanism that works only one time; after it goes off, a service tech-
nician has to fix it before your dryer will operate again.

286
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
You can prevent the dryer from burning its fuse by never opening the door in 
mid-cycle without first turning the dial to the air-dry mode or advancing the 
timer to shut off the heater. If you stop in mid-cycle, the red-hot heaters allow 
heat to collect inside the unit until it triggers the thermal fuse.
 
If you want to interrupt a drying cycle, always let the heater cool off before 
stopping. Otherwise you may wind up line-drying your duds for a while.

(Wiley) - North Pole. Well-informed sources have it that Ol’ St. Nick has 
been forced to replace his bright red uniform with a new one as a result 
of extensive soiling due to unusually dirty fireplaces last holiday season.
W
e’re sure that St. Nick’s wardrobe concerns are serious, but there are 
other, more critical reasons to keep your fireplace and chimney clean 
and in good working order. A dirty chimney not only diminishes the effective-
ness of a fireplace, but, with severe neglect, could be the cause of a chimney 
fire — and chimney fires lead to house fires.
Failing to maintain your fireplace can lead to problems ranging from rela-
tively minor (smoke in the house) to a catastrophic (a chimney fire). In fact, 
the National Fire Protection Association reports that some 64,100 residential 
fires were related to home-heating equipment and fireplace, chimney, and 
chimney connectors in 2006. As a result of these fires, 540 people died, and 
1,400 people were injured. These fires may have been prevented by safer 
use of portable home heating equipment and with regular fireplace chimney 
inspection, cleaning, and repair.
Having Your Fireplace Inspected 
and Swept Regularly
Before modern heating systems were available, the fireplace or wood stove 
was the sole source of heat in a home. Although the fireplace can’t compete 
with modern heating systems as an energy- and cost-efficient source of heat, 
it remains one of the most popular features in a home.

288
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
There are two basic styles of fireplace construction: masonry and prefabri-
cated metal (also called zero clearance). The different fireplace styles operate 
in essentially the same fashion:
 
✓ Each has a firebox (the place where you burn the wood), a damper (the 
door that resides between the firebox and the chimney), a flue (chim-
ney), and a spark arrestor (a screen atop the chimney that prevents 
sparks from getting into the air).
 
✓ Each is typically outfitted with a mesh screen and glass doors.
 
✓ In each type of fireplace, the hearth and fireplace face can be con-
structed of brick, stone, or another decorative finish.
Here are the key differences between masonry fireplaces and prefabricated 
metal fireplaces:
 
✓ A masonry fireplace is custom-built of bricks and mortar. The firebox 
is constructed of firebricks, and the flue consists of bricks or a clay or 
terra-cotta liner. Firebricks and the mortar that surrounds them are 
intended to withstand extreme temperatures.
 
✓ A prefabricated metal fireplace is installed and assembled on-site. The 
metal box contains firebrick panels (see Figure 15-1), called refractory 
brick panels, that line the sides, back, and bottom of the firebox. The flue 
for a prefabricated fireplace consists of a metal pipe that is concealed by 
a chimney constructed of plywood or another siding material.

 Chapter 15: Don’t Get Burned: Fireplaces
However you use your fireplace — as a secondary source of heat during 
winter or simply for its aesthetic qualities — keep in mind that a poorly main-
tained fireplace can spell disaster.
 
Failing to maintain your fireplace properly can lead to a chimney fire. Chimney 
fires occur when combustible deposits on the inner walls of the chimney 
ignite. These explosive deposits, called creosote, are a natural byproduct of 
combustion. A fire hazard exists if 1/8 to 1/4 inch of creosote (or more) coats the 
inner walls of the chimney — built-up creosote is a time bomb waiting to go 
off. Remember: A chimney fire can literally level your house.
One thing stops creosote from becoming a problem: a fireplace inspection and 
sweeping by a professional chimney sweep at least once a year or after burn-
ing one cord of wood — whichever comes first. More-frequent cleanings may 
be required, depending on the type of wood burned, the type of appliance, 
and the frequency of use. In general, an older, uncertified wood stove, or any 
appliance that is used frequently, requires more than one cleaning per year.
 
Prefabricated metal fireplaces often need more frequent cleaning. They burn 
cooler, allowing a higher degree of condensation of combustion deposits on 
the interior surface of the fireplace flue.
Fuel for the fire
The first step to having a healthy, well-main-
tained fireplace is to burn the right fuel. Being 
choosy about what you burn improves heating 
efficiency, helps the environment, and reduces 
the amount of creosote your fires produce.
Your fireplace is not an incinerator! Don’t 
burn garbage, treated or painted wood, plas-
tic, rubber, or any other non-recommended 
material. In addition to causing an unfavor-
able buildup on the interior of the firebox and 
chimney, these materials also produce noxious 
fumes that pollute the air (inside and outside of 
the home). Being careful about what you burn 
is the first line of defense against a catastrophic 
house-leveling chimney fire.
So, what’s best to burn? Osage orange wood, 
oak, hard maple, madrone, hickory, ash, walnut, 
locust, apple, cherry, peach, and plum are the 
top-burning hardwoods. Hardwoods burn longer 
and cleaner with less creosote buildup in the 
chimney than softer woods (such as willow, 
poplar, pine, and cedar). Fortunately, most fire-
wood dealers don’t sell softwoods and recom-
mend hardwoods.
Seasoning is of equal importance when shop-
ping for wood. Unseasoned (green) wood won’t 
burn well due to its high moisture content. When 
it burns, it often sizzles and pops and gives off 
steam. Dry, seasoned wood ignites and burns 
much more easily, and it causes fewer prob-
lems with condensation and creosote.
If most of your fires consist of manufactured fire 
logs, you’ll be pleased to know that independent 
tests have proven that manufactured fire logs 
burn much cleaner than firewood.

290
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
According to the National Chimney Sweep Guild (www.ncsg.org), a national 
trade association comprised of chimney sweeps, a visual inspection is all that 
is normally required for most chimneys. In the case where a visual inspection 
is neither possible nor adequate, many chimney sweeps are equipped to do 
more elaborate inspections with a video camera and monitor referred to as 
a chimscan. A chimscan costs more than a visual inspection, but it reveals 
more and better information about the condition of your chimney — which 
is especially important when the integrity of the flue is in question due to age 
or damage from an earthquake or chimney fire.
Staying on Top of Fireplace Cracks
In a masonry fireplace, firebrick is used to construct the firebox. Refractory 
brick panels line the firebox of a prefabricated metal fireplace. In both cases, 
the bricks and fireclay mortar are designed to withstand extreme tempera-
tures. However, over time, the brick, mortar, or panels can crack and crum-
ble, creating a serious fire hazard.
Here’s what you need to do to address these problems:
 
✓ If a brick in a masonry fireplace cracks, you need to patch it. (Head 
to Chapter 4 for instructions.) If the brick is crumbling, have it replaced 
with a new firebrick embedded in refractory mortar.
 
✓ If the mortar joints in a firebox are crumbling, chisel out the old 
mortar and replace it with new mortar (see Chapter 4). This process, 
known as tuckpointing, is the same one you follow to replace or repair 
mortar joints in any brick structure. The only difference is that in a fire-
box, you must use refractory mortar, which is specially designed to with-
stand extreme temperatures.
 
✓ If the integrity of the majority of the firebrick and mortar in the fire-
box is in question, have a qualified chimney sweep or masonry contrac-
tor inspect it. If replacement is in order, the job is best left to a pro.
 
✓ If a panel of a prefabricated metal fireplace develops extensive cracks 
or is beginning to crumble, replace it with a new panel. This is a job 
that most do-it-yourselfers can handle: Simply remove the old panel by 
unscrewing the screws that hold it in place and install the new panel; it 
should fit snuggly against the adjoining panels. When replacing a rear 
panel, remove the side panels first. Refractory mortar is not generally 
needed, because the corners are designed to fit snuggly against one 
another.
 
 To make the job of finding a replacement panel easy, jot down the fire-
place make and model number. (You can find these numbers on a metal 
plate just inside the opening of the firebox.) Give this information to the 
manufacturer or an installing dealer. Although replacement panels are 

291
 Chapter 15: Don’t Get Burned: Fireplaces
often a stock item, a special order may be required, which can take from 
a few days to a couple of weeks. Don’t use the fireplace until a full and 
final repair has been made.
 
 Note: Repairing minor cracks and mortar joints in prefabricated metal 
fireplaces is essentially the same as with a brick firebox.
Dealing with the Damper
The damper is a steel or cast-iron door that opens or closes the throat of the 
firebox into the flue. It regulates draft and prevents the loss of heat up the 
chimney. To start a fire, you must have the damper in the full-open position. 
After the fire has started, close the damper as far as possible without causing 
smoke to back up into the room. Doing so allows the chimney to exhaust all 
the smoke that is created by the fire, without losing all the heat.
Often, a damper becomes difficult to operate or sticks in one position. One of 
the most pervasive causes of a stuck damper is rust, often caused when rain-
water enters the chimney through a faulty or nonexistent chimney cap (see 
“Arresting sparks and other hazards,” later in this chapter).
You can clean a dirty or rusty damper with a wire brush along with lots of 
elbow grease. Wear safety goggles, work gloves, a hat, and old clothing. Then, 
with the wire brush in one hand and a flashlight in the other, use the brush to 
remove soot and rust buildup (see Figure 15-2).
 
Figure 15-2: 
Cleaning 
your 
damper.
 

292
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
If, after cleaning the damper, it still sticks, slide a short length of pipe — about 
20 to 24 inches — over the damper handle (this extends the damper handle); 
then beat on the pipe with a sledgehammer to break the damper loose. If the 
damper still refuses to budge, use a rust and corrosion cutting oil such as 
WD-40 to help dissolve the rust and corrosion at the damper’s hinges.
When the damper is operational, work it back and forth while applying a 
high-temperature lubricant at all the joints and moving parts. When it’s clean 
and in good working order, spray-paint the damper with a black high-temper-
ature paint to prevent future rusting.
 
Fireplaces without dampers or with faulty dampers can be retrofitted with 
new dampers. Unlike the style of damper located immediately above the fire-
box, a retrofit model is mounted at the top of the chimney and is operated by 
a long chain that hangs down the chimney.
Caring for the Outside of Your Chimney
Although caring for the inside of your fireplace, chimney, and damper is 
important, don’t forget the outside. A chimney can be either an exposed pipe, 
a framed enclosure that is covered with siding (called a sided chase) that 
houses the flue pipe, or a masonry chimney.
Taking care of the flashing and flue pipe
The chimney travels from the inside of the home to the outside either 
through an attic and roof or out a wall. The point where the chimney exits the 
structure is a primary source of leaks. Thus, you should water-test the flash-
ing that surrounds this location using a garden hose, to make sure that it’s in 
good condition and leak-free. (Turn to Chapter 5 for instructions on how to 
use a water hose to discover leaks.)
Another potential problem area is the metal pipe itself. It can be attacked by 
rust, and the joints can become loose. To maintain the metal pipe:
 
1. Use a wire brush to remove the rust.
 
2. Prime and paint the rusted area with high-temperature paint.
 
3. Use a screwdriver to tighten screws at all connections.
 
4. Install new self-tapping sheet-metal screws at locations where screws 
were previously installed and worked loose. (Self-tapping screws are 
ones with their own built-in drill-bit tips.)
 
 Remove an existing screw and use it as an example when purchasing 
replacement screws.

293
 Chapter 15: Don’t Get Burned: Fireplaces
Masonry fireplaces have a unique flashing detail called a masonry counter 
flashing, which is a secondary piece of flashing that covers the primary flash-
ing. The counter flashing has a slight lip that’s inserted into a mortar joint 
and then either mortared or caulked into place. Water-test the caulking or 
mortar annually (see Chapter 5), and repair or replace it as needed.
 
Apply a coat of paint to help hide otherwise unattractive flashing and prevent 
it from deteriorating quite so rapidly.
Sealing the deal
In areas where the climate gets unusually cold, we’ve actually seen unsealed 
brick on chimneys shatter. Water enters the pores of the brick, freezes, and 
then expands, causing the brick to explode.
 
You can prevent water seepage and the damage to bricks and mortar caused 
by freeze and thaw cycles by applying a coat of top-quality masonry sealer to 
all the brick or stone surrounding the fireplace and chimney. Apply the sealer 
with a pump garden sprayer, roller, or brush. Chimney sweeps usually keep 
masonry sealers in stock.
Arresting sparks and other hazards
A spark arrestor is a cage-like device with a solid cap, which is secured to the 
top of the chimney (see Figure 15-3). It prevents sparks and ash from escaping 
and causing a fire on the roof or on other potentially flammable substances. It 
also keeps squirrels, birds, and raccoons from nesting in the chimney. Nesting 
materials can cause a serious safety hazard; plus, the animals’ droppings pose 
health risks, because diseases may be transmitted through fecal matter.
The solid cap — usually metal — prevents rainwater from entering the chim-
ney. Rainwater can cause significant damage to the interior of a chimney by 
combining with the creosote to produce an acid that breaks down the flue 
lining and mortar. Rainwater also causes the damper to rust.
If your chimney doesn’t have a spark arrestor, install one. If your chimney 
already has one, make sure that it’s in good condition (no holes in the mesh 
and no rust or deterioration on the cap) and securely fastened to the top 
of the chimney. If you find holes (or if you accidentally make a hole or two 
while trying to remove rust with a wire brush), try patching the holes before 
replacing the entire unit. The method used to patch the spark arrestor screen 
is similar to the process used when patching a window screen, except that 
you use galvanized wire mesh rather than window screen material (see 
Chapter 6 for more information).

You can patch a rusting chimney cap using a small piece of galvanized sheet 
metal that is slightly larger than the damaged area. Attach the patch using 
pop rivets. You’ll need pop rivets, a pop-rivet gun, and an electric drill with 
a bit that corresponds to the size of the pop rivets. If rust is a problem, see 
Chapter 19 for tips on how to remove rust. After it’s clean and repaired, paint 
the spark arrestor to prevent future rust and to slow deterioration.
Cleaning a Soot-Covered 
Brick Fireplace Face
Oils and soot make an otherwise handsome brick fireplace face look tired 
and tattered. To reduce the effect of oils and soot, regularly vacuum a brick 
face and hearth, and periodically wipe them down with a damp sponge. To 
prevent smoke from staining your fireplace face, elevate the fire by adding a 
layer or two of firebrick at the bottom of the firebox.
If the hearth is so soiled that you can no longer determine what material it’s 
constructed from, then it’s time for a more serious cleaning. All you need is 
a 10 percent solution of muriatic acid. (That’s one part muriatic acid to nine 
parts water. Add the acid to the water, not the other way around.) Use a bris-
tle brush to clean the affected area and rinse with fresh water. More than one 
application may be required for extra-dirty areas.

295
 Chapter 15: Don’t Get Burned: Fireplaces
 
You can buy muriatic acid in the swimming-pool supplies section of your local 
hardware store, home center, or pool-supply store.
 
Working with acid is dangerous. Be sure to wear rubber gloves and safety 
goggles, and have plenty of ventilation.
Making the Most out of 
Glass Doors and Screens
A fireplace exhausts smoke in a sort of siphon action. When heat begins 
to rise through the stack, the siphon continues to draw air from within the 
house. The end result is that the draw in your fireplace can actually remove 
warm air from the home. And because fires burn oxygen, in a tightly sealed 
home, a fireplace drains a home of oxygen.
To offset both problems, do the following:
 
✓ Install glass doors. Glass doors act as dampers when the fireplace isn’t 
being used and reduce the amount of warm air that is drawn out of the 
home and into the fireplace when a fire has been reduced to embers.
 
 Glass doors are designed for energy efficiency and not to prevent sparks 
from flying onto the carpet. Consequently, doors are left open when a 
fire is burning. There is an exception to this rule. Glass doors can be 
used as an added layer of protection when you need to leave the house 
while hot embers remain in the fireplace.
 
✓ Add outside air ducts to the inside of the firebox. Outside air ducts — 
also known as combustion air ducts — are required in the construction 
of all new fireplaces and can be retrofitted into existing ones. Outside air 
ducts provide air from the exterior of the home, leaving oxygen in the 
home for you to breathe. Naturally, if the fireplace draws air from ducts, 
it won’t need to draw warm air from within the home.
 
 Periodically check these ducts to make sure that they’re clean and free 
of spider webs and other debris.
Cleaning glass fireplace doors
 
Here is a neat trick that keeps glass fireplace doors clean and neat year-round:
 
1. After the doors have cooled, spray them with glass or window cleaner 
or your own mixture of vinegar and water.

296
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
 
2. Spray a clean soft cloth until a wet spot is created.
 
3. Dip the wet spot into the fine gray ash left by your last fire and rub 
the ash onto the dirty surface.
 
 The ash fills the microscopic pores of the glass, thus reducing the sur-
face tension, making it easier to clean than ever before.
 
4. After the ash has dried to a haze, buff the glass clear with a clean, 
dry cloth.
Oven cleaner also works well for cleaning smoke-covered glass doors.
 
Make sure to wear rubber gloves and eye protection, have plenty of ventila-
tion, and follow the manufacturer’s instructions when working with oven 
cleaner.
Giving sluggish glass doors a pick-me-up
If your fireplace doors are operating less than smoothly, some cleaning, a 
little lubrication, or a slight adjustment usually fixes the problem.
Most doors can be raised and lowered or adjusted from side to side using a 
screwdriver or a small open-end wrench. Make a small adjustment and open 
and close the door until it operates smoothly. Lightly lubricate tracks, hinges, 
and other moving parts with a high-temperature lubricant (available from 
most fireplace dealers).
 
Because not all doors are alike (some are swinging, others are bi-fold), your 
best bet is to refer to the owner’s manual for specific information on how to 
adjust the doors. If you’re unable to find the manual, visit a local fireplace 
shop.
Screening out difficulties
A fireplace screen is essential for a safe fire. The mesh screen prevents 
sparks from flying onto the carpet or flooring in front of the fireplace and 
causing a fire.
Some screens are freestanding, others are bolted to the fireplace face, and 
still others are an integral part of the glass-door system. Although the free-
standing models can be decorative, they offer the least amount of protection; 
we suggest replacing or augmenting a freestanding screen with one of the 
other alternatives available.

297
 Chapter 15: Don’t Get Burned: Fireplaces
Most screens include a metal rod. As the screen and rod become dirty, the 
screen becomes increasingly difficult to operate. To keep the screen gliding 
smoothly, periodically vacuum the top of the screen and rod using an uphol-
stery attachment, and then wipe with a damp sponge followed by a touch of 
high-temperature lubricant.
Just as with every other surface near the fireplace, the screen can develop 
a buildup of soot and oils from combustion. Rust can also be a problem. 
Although many cleaning products can cut the grease, some screens are just 
too dirty to be cleaned this way. If yours happens to be the latter, try either 
of the following (both are best performed in a bathtub or outdoors):
 
✓ Use oven cleaner. To get rid of rust on the screen, first remove as much 
rust as you can with a wire brush. (Remember: Make sure to wear eye 
protection and gloves, and work in a well-ventilated area; outdoors is 
good.) Next, apply a light coat of oven cleaner to the entire surface of 
the screen. Allow the oven cleaner to do its thing, and then rinse thor-
oughly with fresh water. After the screen has dried, paint it with a heat-
resistant, matte-black spray paint. Doing this every few years keeps your 
fireplace screen looking like new.
 
✓ Use ammonia. Remove the screens from the fireplace and place them 
in a large plastic trash bag. Pour in 1 cup of ammonia, seal the bag, and 
allow it to sit overnight. The ammonia takes all the elbow grease out of 
cleaning the screens. Remove the screens, rinse, and paint.

Preventing and Dealing 
with Household Fires
Fire has been a number-one household danger ever since the day, eons ago, 
when our prehistoric ancestors got the idea to bring fire indoors to heat their 
caves and cook their mammoths.

300
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
 
So what is your best defense against fire? Quite simply: good old common 
sense! Here are some specific strategies to employ in your home:
 
✓ Exercise great care with all flammable materials near high heat sources 
and be especially careful with combustible liquids (like solvents, clean-
ers and fuels), both when using and storing them.
 
✓ Keep space heaters at least 3 feet away from flammable items. Only buy 
units with tip-over shut-off switches, and never operate a space heater 
while sleeping.
 
✓ Don’t overload electrical circuits or put too great a burden on individual 
outlets or lightweight extension cords.
 
✓ Don’t use a bulb with a higher wattage than a lamp or fixture is rated for.
 
✓ Watch for faulty electronic equipment, malfunctioning appliances, frayed 
electrical cords, flickering lights, or fuses that blow and circuit breakers 
that trip repeatedly.
 
✓ Never smoke in bed or when you’re tired or lying down, and make sure 
any ashes have cooled before you throw them away.
In this section, we tell you how to maintain your smoke detectors and fire 
extinguishers so that, if fire does strike, you and your family have the best 
possible chance of getting out of your house without harm.
Smoke detectors
Smoke detectors (also referred to as smoke alarms) are among the least 
expensive, and best, forms of protection you can buy. Check this out: A work-
ing smoke detector doubles your chance of surviving a fire.
 
For minimum coverage, have at least one smoke detector on every level of your 
home and in every sleeping area. Alarms can also be added to hallways outside 
every bedroom, the tops and bottoms of all stairways, and often-forgotten 
places such as basements, attics, utility rooms, and garages.
Battery-operated smoke detectors are inexpensive and easy to install. Make 
sure you check the batteries frequently.
AC-powered units are much more dependable than battery-powered detec-
tors due to their direct-wired power source; they should be installed by an 
electrician or by someone with a good working knowledge of electricity. If 
you opt for an AC-powered unit, make sure you buy one that has an indepen-
dent battery backup so it continues to operate when the power is interrupted 
(during a blackout or electrical fire, for example).

301
 Chapter 16: Maintaining Your Home-Safety Systems
 
Regardless of which type of detector you have, follow these tips to maintain it 
properly:
 
✓ Once a month, make sure the batteries and alarm are working. Get 
up on a chair, or use a broom handle for extra reach, and push the test 
button. If you don’t hear anything, your battery is probably dead. If after 
changing the battery, the smoke detector still isn’t working, immediately 
replace it with a new one.
 
 All smoke detectors have a test button, which, when pushed, causes the 
alarm to sound. Also, most detectors have either a blinking or solid light 
that glows to let you know that the alarm is getting power. 
 
✓ Make sure the smoke detector is operating properly. Once a month, 
put two or three lighted matches together (the wood kitchen type is 
best), and then blow out the flame, holding the matches so that the 
smoke wafts up toward the unit. (You may also use synthetic smoke 
in an aerosol can, which can be found at most hardware stores.) If the 
detector doesn’t go off, and you’ve checked the batteries, replace the 
unit immediately.
 
✓ Every six months, replace the batteries. You can easily remember to 
replace the batteries if you replace them when the time changes to and 
from daylight saving time, in the spring and fall.
 
 Never remove a battery from your smoke alarm to use it in another 
item — like a radio, toy, or TV remote. First, you don’t really know how 
much power those batteries still have. Second, you’re likely to forget to 
replace it in the smoke alarm.
 
✓ Brush or vacuum the alarm to keep dirt and dust out of the mecha-
nism. Do this at least four times per year or more often if you live in a 
dusty area. Never use cleaning sprays or solvents that can enter the unit 
and contaminate sensors.
 
✓ After ten years of use, replace smoke detectors. At that point, a smoke 
detector has endured more than 87,000 hours of continuous operation, 
and the internal sensors probably have become contaminated with dust, 
dirt, and air pollutant residues.
Fire extinguishers
Most fires start small. If you have a working fire extinguisher on hand, you 
may be able to easily and quickly put out a fire. Manufacturers of home safety 
products recommend having one fire extinguisher for every 600 square feet 
of living area. The kitchen, garage, and basement each should have an extin-
guisher, too. It’s a good idea to keep one in your car, too.

302
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
 
When you’re shopping for a fire extinguisher, be sure to purchase one that has 
a pressure gauge. Check the gauge once a month to ensure that you have a 
working extinguisher when you need it. If you find that the extinguisher’s pres-
sure is low, and it’s a model that can’t be recharged, dispose of it and replace 
it with a new unit.
By the way, we shouldn’t have to tell you why “testing” an extinguisher by 
pulling the pin and squeezing the trigger is a bad, wasteful, and dangerous 
idea.
 
If you can’t practice, though, how will you know how to use a fire extinguisher 
when you’re faced with a fire? Remember this acronym: PASS.
 
✓ Pull the pin.
 
✓ Aim at the base of the fire.
 
✓ Squeeze the handle.
 
✓ Sweep the base of the fire from side to side, starting with the closest 
edge and working away from yourself.
Preventing Carbon-Monoxide Poisoning
Carbon monoxide (CO) is the number-one cause of poisoning deaths in the 
United States. CO is an invisible, odorless, poisonous gas produced by the 
incomplete combustion of any fuel — such as gasoline, kerosene, propane, 
natural gas, oil, and even wood fires. CO in your home can be fatal, killing in 
minutes or hours, depending on the level of CO in the air. At low concentra-
tions, CO produces a wide range of flu-like symptoms, including shortness 
of breath, mild nausea, and mild headache. At moderate concentrations, the 
symptoms are headache, dizziness, nausea, and light-headedness. At high 
concentrations, the “symptoms” are unconsciousness and death.
 
One telltale sign of mild CO poisoning is flu symptoms that go away when 
you’re outside the home in fresh air.
The typical sources of CO in homes are malfunctioning gas furnaces, gas 
stoves, water heaters, clothes dryers, and even improperly vented fireplaces. 
Other major dangers include using a gasoline-powered generator in or too 
near the home, using a barbecue unit indoors (or in the garage) to cook or 
heat during a power outage, and letting a car run in the garage or carport 
where exhaust fumes can collect and enter the home. Making matters worse, 
many of today’s energy-efficient homes minimize outside air exchange and 
cross-ventilation, giving CO no chance to exit once it enters the home.

303
 Chapter 16: Maintaining Your Home-Safety Systems
Maintaining your carbon-
monoxide detector
CO wafts through a room like perfume — only you can’t smell or see it — 
which is why having a working CO detector in your home is critical. If you 
don’t already have a CO detector, you should buy one. The Consumer 
Product Safety Commission (CPSC) recommends that every home with fuel-
burning appliances of any kind be equipped with a least one CO detector. 
Place your CO detectors anywhere from 14 inches above the floor to eye 
level, and never where there is a draft (such as near a window, doorway, or 
stairwell).
 
If you have only one unit, place it in the hall outside the bedroom area of your 
home. Invisible, odorless, poisonous CO in concentrated form is far less likely 
to awaken someone who’s sleeping than thick, toxic smoke is.
CO detectors can be battery operated, hard-wired, mounted directly in an 
electrical wall outlet, or plugged in to an electrical cord (which allows units 
to sit on a shelf or tabletop). If you use a unit that plugs in to a direct power 
source, make sure it also has an independent battery backup.
Your CO detector should have a digital display with memory that indicates 
and records a problem, even when it’s too small to trigger the alarm. A 
normal low level of CO in a home is zero. Nada, zilch, zip. However, even a 
small reading — such as 25, 30, or 35 parts per million — indicates a problem 
that could escalate.
The care and maintenance of CO detectors is basically the same as for smoke 
detectors with regard to cleaning and frequent testing. (See the “Smoke 
detectors” section, earlier in this chapter, for more information.)
 
Because you can’t test a carbon-monoxide detector using an outside source 
(the way you can light some matches under a smoke detector to see if it’s 
working), you have to remember to press the test button on the CO detector 
once each month to make sure the detector is working.
Paying attention to sources 
of carbon monoxide
Don’t mess around with CO. Once a year, have your heating system, vents, 
chimney, and flue inspected (and cleaned if necessary) by a qualified techni-
cian. And make sure that your fuel-burning appliances always are vented. 

304
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
(See Chapter 10 for more information on heating and venting systems. 
Chapter 15 tells you all about chimney and flue inspections.)
Other maintenance procedures should include checking and correcting any 
signs that indicate potential CO problems, including:
 
✓ A noticeably decreasing hot-water supply
 
✓ A furnace that runs constantly but doesn’t heat your house
 
✓ Soot collecting on, under, and around any appliance
 
✓ An unfamiliar burning odor
 
✓ A loose or missing furnace panel or vent pipe
 
✓ Damaged brick, chimney discoloration, or a loose-fitting chimney pipe
Keeping Your Natural-Gas Line Safe
Of all emergency preparedness efforts, gas lines deserve extra consideration — 
both in the event of natural disasters and for day-to-day living. Natural gas 
is the most potentially dangerous item in your home. Gas can cause instant 
flash fires and devastating explosions that can result from negligence and 
carelessness.
 
Gas lines must be properly installed, monitored, and maintained to prevent 
these catastrophes. Here’s how:
 
✓ Protect your gas meter. An exposed gas meter is always susceptible to 
damage or being dislodged by contact. For protection from housework 
and gardening, and to keep gas meters located near driveways and side-
walks from being hit, place two heavy metal pipes in concrete (much like 
you would set a fence post) in front of and on both sides of the gas meter.
 
 Don’t pour concrete or put asphalt around the rigid gas delivery pipe 
that comes up out of the ground leading to the meter. This pipe must 
remain in soft and pliable dirt to safely ride out any seismic activity.
 
✓ Keep the gas-line shut-off wrench handy and easily accessible in a gas 
emergency. Attach the wrench to the main line at the shut-off valve with 
a piece of chain and a hose clamp. If you ever have to close the main gas 
valve, you only need to rotate the bar on the valve one-quarter turn, so 
that it runs across the gas line (closed) rather than parallel to it (open).
 
✓ Inspect all gas-line connections in your home. Those leading to appli-
ances, furnaces, and water heaters should only be a flexible, corrugated 

305
 Chapter 16: Maintaining Your Home-Safety Systems
stainless steel or a new epoxy-coated flexible connector. You should see 
a shut-off valve where the gas line meets the solid gas delivery line.
 
 If you have a rigid connection to your gas appliance, remove it and 
replace it with an approved flexible connector.
 
✓ Always call before you dig. There are many types of underground 
lines serving your home — from gas and electricity to water, telephone, 
and cable TV — and they’re often only a few feet below the surface. So 
before you dig a ditch, sink a fence post, or plant a tree or bush, call 
your local utility companies to come out and mark where the lines are.
 
 If you dig and hit your cable TV line, you face a slight inconvenience 
until the cable company can come out and repair the line. But if you hit 
a gas line, you may cause an explosion or fire.
Shining a Light on Electrical Safety
What are the signs of a potentially dangerous electrical problem? It’s time to 
call the electrician when you see any of the following:
 
✓ Habitually flickering lights
 
✓ A breaker that repeatedly pops
 
✓ A fuse that repeatedly burns out
Any of these can signal a loose connection or an overloaded circuit, which 
ultimately can cause a house fire.
 
You should leave most electrical work to a qualified electrician.
The ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) was developed to help save 
people from getting shocked. When a short or ground fault occurs, the GFCI 
detects it. Any variation indicates that some of the current is going where 
it’s not supposed to go and is creating a shock hazard. When this occurs, the 
GFCI trips in 1/40 second — a short enough period of time so that most healthy 
people aren’t injured.
 
Make sure that GFCIs are installed at all receptacles within 4 feet of a sink, at 
all exterior and garage receptacles, and at all electric fixtures over showers 
and tubs.
 
All GFCI receptacles have test buttons. Be sure to test each GFCI receptacle in 
your home once a month. If the test doesn’t trip the breaker, replace the GFCI 
immediately.

Maintaining Your Burglar Alarm
Not all household dangers come from the inside. You also need to take measures 
to protect against those who would storm the castle, scale the proverbial stone 
walls, and plunder your family’s treasures. A number of whole-house alarm sys-
tems are available today, and — just as with smoke detectors and carbon-monoxide 
detectors — these need occasional testing, checking, and tuning up:
Common sense measures to 
keep the bad guys at bay
A few simple guidelines can make your home 
as tight as the proverbial bug in a rug, affording 
you greater safety while you’re home and when 
you’re away:
 ✓ Check all window and door locks to make 
sure that they’re operating properly. Install 
backup or secondary security locks and 
latches at vulnerable locations. Then use 
these simple protections — always.
 ✓ Add a heavy-duty security storm door to 
outside doors.
 ✓ Toughen up sliding patio doors with pin 
locks and crossbars to deter forced opening. 
A pin lock is a small barrel bolt that mounts 
on the floor against the interior of the sliding 
patio door frame. A thumb turn inserts the 
barrel or “pin” into a hole that you drill into 
the bottom of the center upright of the door 
frame. A crossbar is a fancy metal version of 
the wooden broom stick or closet pole that 
you lay in the door track to prevent the door 
from being opened. Instead of laying in the 
door track, the crossbar is attached to the 
interior of the sliding patio door frame (usu-
ally midway up the door) and abuts the slid-
ing door, preventing it from being opened.
 ✓ Trim back any thin shrubbery and bushes 
near windows and doors that may provide 
cover for a burglar’s work-in-process.
 ✓ Add outdoor security lighting with a 
motion detector on/off control. See Home 
Improvement For Dummies, by Gene 
and Katie Hamilton (Wiley Publishing), for 
more information on installing a motion 
detector.
 ✓ Add metal security bars over windows and 
doors in high-risk areas, such as basement 
windows. Make sure that these bars have 
quick-release safety latches for easy emer-
gency escape for those inside.
 ✓ Never hide a house key in an obvious loca-
tion. Even amateurs know most favorites, 
like under doormats, in flower pots, and 
inside fake rocks.
 ✓ Close drapes and shades when you’re out. 
The goal is to prevent burglars from seeing 
that you’re gone.
 ✓ Always be on the lookout for unusual activ-
ity and new faces near your home.
 ✓ During the holidays, don’t leave large dis-
plays of gifts and presents in plain view 
when you’re out. If your holiday involves 
decorating a tree, keep it well watered for 
fire safety, and unplug all indoor decorative 
lighting before leaving the house.

307
 Chapter 16: Maintaining Your Home-Safety Systems
 
✓ At least twice a year, check and replace the batteries in your alarm 
system. Most alarm systems include a fail-safe battery backup.
 
✓ Check the fire-sensing capability of your burglar alarm monthly. Many 
systems have a fire-sensing capability; check and maintain it as outlined 
in the “Smoke detectors” section, earlier in this chapter.
 
✓ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for maintaining and checking 
the keypad and the horn or siren. Pay particular attention to all points 
that signal an intrusion when contact is broken.
 
✓ Make sure sensitivity levels are properly set to avoid both frequent 
false alarms and a system that doesn’t respond properly when it 
should. If you experience frequent false alarms, you and your family will 
eventually start to ignore them — and you may ignore the alarm when 
you need to pay attention to it!
 
Before ordering and installing an alarm, check with local law-enforcement 
agencies to see about any restrictions or special ordinances in your area. Most 
police departments now discourage homeowners from installing a dialer-
type alarm system that automatically calls the police or sheriff’s department 
when activated because, during major disasters, this type of alarm completely 
swamps incoming lines that are needed to field calls for specific individual 
emergency situations.
 
A good alternative is to have your alarm monitored by a central reporting 
agency. Thus, if there is a false alarm, the police or sheriff won’t be sum-
moned, and you’ll be off the hook for a false-alarm fee and the embarrassment 
of having the cops show up at your home only to find you in your bathrobe 
collecting the morning paper. Oops!
Testing the Safety Mechanisms in Your 
Automatic Garage-Door Opener
Garage doors are heavy, and they can close quickly, posing a danger to 
anyone or anything that happens to be under them when they come down. 
To address this safety issue, a federal law was passed in April 1982, requiring 
closing garage doors that are operated by automatic openers to reverse off 
of a 2-inch block (that is, the door must open if it meets even a small obstruc-
tion on the way down).
Even with the safety improvements mandated by the April 1982 legislation, 
injuries continued to occur, and safety remained an issue, resulting in a 1993 
law requiring that a garage-door opener must be equipped with a monitored 

308
Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
non-contact safety reversing device or safety edge that stops and reverses a 
closing garage door, such as:
 
✓ An electronic-beam sensor that is installed at either side of the door 
opening: When the beam is broken, the door stops and reverses itself.
 
✓ A pressure-sensitive electronic rubber strip that attaches to the 
bottom of the door where it makes contact with the floor: When the 
strip comes into contact with an object, the door automatically stops 
and reverses itself, avoiding injury or damage to property.
In addition to extending its life, monthly inspection and testing of the auto-
matic opener can prevent serious injuries and property damage. Careless 
operation and allowing children to play with or use garage door opener con-
trols are dangerous situations that can lead to tragic results. A few simple 
precautions can protect your family and friends from potential harm.
These tests are particularly important after any repairs or adjustments are 
made to the garage door or opener:
 
✓ Test the force setting of the garage door opener, by using one of your 
hands to hold up the bottom of the door as it closes. If the door doesn’t 
reverse, the force is excessive and needs adjusting. Check your garage-
door owner’s manual — it explains how to adjust the force sensitivity.
 
✓ Test the reversing mechanism and the pressure-sensitive rubber 
strip. Place a 2-x-4-inch block of wood flat on the floor in the door’s 
path before activating the door. If the door fails to immediately stop and 
reverse when it strikes the wood, disconnect the opener and use the 
door manually until the system can be repaired or replaced.
 
✓ Test the electronic beam sensor. Place a bucket or some other big 
object in the beam path, and activate the door. The door should not 
move. If it does, it needs to be repaired immediately.
 
✓ Test the non-contact safety device. Activate the door and wave a broom 
across the beam. The door should stop and reverse immediately. If it 
doesn’t stop, it needs to be repaired immediately.
 
Never stand or walk under a moving door. Don’t let children play “beat the 
door.” Keep transmitters and remote controls out of reach of children and 
teach them that they are not toys. The push-button wall control should be out 
of reach of children (at least 5 feet from the floor) and away from all moving 
parts. The button should always be mounted where you can clearly see the 
door in full operation.
 
As with all mechanical components in a home, an automatic garage-door opener 
requires periodic maintenance to ensure safe and efficient operation. One of the 
best resources for garage-door maintenance is the opener owner’s manual.

309
 Chapter 16: Maintaining Your Home-Safety Systems
 
If you don’t have an owner’s manual, you can usually order a replacement 
copy by contacting an installing dealer or the manufacturer. Some manufac-
turers make owner’s manuals available on the Internet — all you need is the 
brand and model number.
Guarding Your Home against 
Natural Disasters
Natural disasters can befall the average home and typical family without 
warning. Earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, mudslides, blizzards, 
tidal waves, lightning, squalls, gales, downpours, monsoons, typhoons, 
whirlwinds, and microbursts can come out of nowhere and cause substantial 
damage to a home. You can’t do anything about the weather, but you can be 
prepared for such emergencies — and being prepared may save your life and 
avert damage to your home.
 
The best defense against becoming a victim of a natural disaster is a strong 
offense — keeping your home in tip-top shape. For example, maintaining your 
roof can prevent shingles from being blown off and a roof leak from occurring. 
Installing a plumbing pipe heater can prevent hundreds or thousands of dol-
lars in damage caused by a burst pipe due to freezing. The first step to shoring 
up your castle is to properly maintain your home everyday.
Maintaining your garage door
Here are common maintenance tasks that you 
can perform to keep your garage doors operat-
ing smoothly:
 ✓ Visually inspect the garage-door springs, 
cables, rollers, and other door hardware. 
Look for signs of wear and frayed or broken 
parts. Most minor repairs, such as roller 
replacement, can be performed by a handy 
do-it-yourselfer, while more complicated 
tasks should be handled by a qualified 
garage-door service technician. Warning: 
The springs and related hardware are 
under high tension and can cause severe 
injury when handled improperly.
 ✓ Periodically lubricate the rollers, springs, 
hinges, and tracks. Use spray silicone, 
lightweight household oil, or white lithium 
grease according to the instructions in your 
owner’s manual.
 ✓ Periodically test the balance of the door. 
Start with the door closed. Disconnect the 
automatic-opener release mechanism so 
that the door can be operated by hand. 
The door should lift smoothly and with little 
resistance. It should stay open around 
3 to 4 feet above the floor. If it doesn’t, it’s 
out of balance and should be adjusted by 
a professional.

When disaster is upon you
When your castle comes under siege from any of Mother Nature’s natural 
marauders, three defensive maneuvers should take place in rapid succession:
 
1. Go to your safe place.
 
 Have a safe place ready in the home, such as a windowless room in the 
basement, and stock it with emergency survival supplies, including first-
aid equipment, a radio, bottled water, and emergency food provisions. 
(See the nearby sidebar, “Your emergency preparedness kit.”)
 
2. Stay in your safe place until you get the all clear.
 
 That’s why you need the radio with functioning batteries! A portable 
phone (with extra batteries) can also come in handy at this stage.
 
3. Check for damage.
 
 First, check the status and well-being of your family members and 
nearby neighbors. Then begin a thorough home inspection to ascertain 
any damage that may create larger problems.
 
 Check especially for damaged power lines and dangerous gas leaks, 
which can cause fire and explosions. Next, check for electrical-system 
Your emergency preparedness kit
Once an emergency is upon you, it’s too late to 
gather the things. So assemble the following 
beforehand:
 ✓ A full first-aid kit: Look for a kit that comes 
with instructions on how to deal with most 
major situations and injuries step by step. 
Also, watch for free first-aid training classes 
in your area, often sponsored by local orga-
nizations, hospitals, police departments, or 
fire departments.
 ✓ Emergency food provisions and bottled 
water: Check this kit twice a year for 
expiration dates and the freshness of the 
products it contains. When they expire, 
replace them.
 ✓ Emergency gear: You need a pair of sturdy 
shoes (to prevent injuries from rubble and 
broken glass), heavy socks, heavy work 
gloves, and clothing for keeping warm and 
dry for an extended period of time, both day 
and night. Make sure to include all these 
items for each member of your family. (You 
don’t need heavy work gloves for your chil-
dren, but they should have everything else.)
 ✓ Portable and self-contained lighting: You 
need flashlights, extra batteries, candles, a 
disposable butane lighter, and waterproof 
matches.
 ✓ A radio: How else will you hear the all 
clear?

311
 Chapter 16: Maintaining Your Home-Safety Systems
damage and downed power lines. If you see sparks, note exposed wiring, 
or smell overheated insulation on wiring, shut off the electricity at the 
main circuit breaker or fuse box. If water is present, be careful not to 
make contact if you suspect it may be electrically charged.
 
 Also, ascertain any damage to water pipes and sewer drain lines. If 
they’re damaged, turn off the main water-supply valve, avoid drinking 
any tap or well water, and don’t flush toilets or let water drain from bath-
tubs, showers, and sinks.
 
Well in advance of any natural emergency, you should know where your valves 
and circuit breakers are located. Make sure that you know how to turn off all 
major supply lines, and show your family members how to do this, too. Many 
hardware stores and home centers sell an inexpensive combination dual-
emergency wrench designed specifically for quick gas and water shut-offs.
 
For more information on disaster preparedness and recovery, go to the 
American Red Cross Web site at www.redcross.org.
Putting things back together
Follow these general guidelines for getting back underway after an emergency:
 
✓ Deal cautiously with structural damage, watching for physical dangers 
(everything from broken glass and nails to water and wet surfaces that 
may be electrically charged after power resumes). According to the 
American Red Cross, after drowning, the biggest flood killer is electrocu-
tion. Report downed power lines to your utility company or emergency 
management office.
 
✓ Use a flashlight to inspect for damage. Don’t smoke or use candles, lan-
terns, or open flames unless you know that the gas has been turned off 
and the area has been aired out.
 
✓ Prevent deadly carbon-monoxide poisoning by using a generator or 
other gasoline-powered machine outdoors and away from the home. 
The same goes for camping stoves and charcoal grills.
 
✓ Don’t use appliances or motors that have gotten wet unless they’ve 
been taken apart, cleaned, and dried. Some appliances, such as televi-
sion sets, keep electrical charges even after they’ve been unplugged.
 
✓ Watch for snakes and wild animals that have been flooded out of their 
homes. They may seek shelter in yours.
 
✓ Discard contaminated foods and kitchen and bath products, and boil 
drinking water until you’re absolutely sure it’s entirely safe to drink.

Part IV: Inside Home Sweet Home 
 
✓ Pump out flooded areas in your home as soon as possible to avoid 
permanent damage to the house frame. Be sure to pump out your base-
ment slowly over the course of several days to prevent the basement 
walls from caving in due to the excessive amount of pressure being 
placed on the walls from water-logged soil on the opposite side.
 
✓ If hardwood floors get soaked, mop up excess water and debris imme-
diately and dry the floors slowly to reduce warping. Don’t use heat 
for drying. (Drying finishes out too quickly can cause warping, buckling, 
and cracking that can otherwise be avoided if finishes are allowed to 
dry more slowly.) Open windows and doors and allow finishes to air-dry. 
Rent a high-volume fan such as those used by professional carpet clean-
ers to hasten the air-drying process.
 
✓ If carpeting gets soaked, pick up excess water with a wet/dry vac or 
carpet-cleaning machine, slowly peel back wet carpet, and discard 
the padding. Set up a box fan or two to completely dry the area. In most 
cases, carpets can be cleaned and reused; just the padding needs to be 
replaced.
 
✓ Have a pro check all plumbing and service your septic tank.
 
✓ Call your insurance agent immediately to get the financial part of the 
recovery process underway.
 
After immediate dangers are dealt with and relatively under control, take 
photos to record all damage to your home and its contents for insurance pur-
poses. All too often, this only comes to mind once cleanup and repairs are 
well underway.

T
he tale of Zorro and his mastery of swordsmanship 
has always thrilled us. That’s probably why we got 
into construction — we had to find some way to be good 
at fencing.
Maintaining the inside of your home is only part of the 
equation. Outdoors there’s more: the patio, driveway and 
walkways, decking, trellises, and, yes, fencing.
In this part, we show you how to care for everything out-
side, including patching, puttying, painting, staining, oil-
ing, and caulking — tasks that add life and beauty to the 
outside of your home. And remember, Zorro did most of 
his fencing outdoors, too.

R
umor has it that Jimmy Hoffa’s career ended one evening while wearing 
cement slippers. And because he hasn’t been found, we can assume 
that the guys who mixed the concrete knew exactly what they were doing. 
But then again, they probably weren’t too worried about the quality of their 
work. Most homeowners, however, are worried about the quality and condi-
tion of their concrete; specifically, they’re concerned about cracks. Cracks 
are caused by ground movement — and that’s what damages most concrete.
Although concrete bears the brunt of the traffic around most homes, 
masonry (brick and stone) often is used instead of, or in addition to, concrete 
for paths, patios, and walkways. And when they’re not used on the ground, 
brick or stone almost always can be found as a decorative element on homes. 
Moreover, because concrete, brick, and stone are similar in composition, the 
materials and techniques used to clean and preserve one of them can, more 
often than not, be used to clean and preserve the others, so we’ve put them 
together in this chapter.
Whether your carport is concrete or your patio brick, cleaning, repairing, and 
sealing make them look good and last a long time.
Cementing Your Relationship 
with Concrete
This may come as a surprise to you: Your sidewalk, driveway, patio, and 
paths are not made of cement. Instead, they’re made of concrete, which con-
tains cement — Portland cement to be exact. Basic concrete is a mixture of 

316
Part V: Out in the Great Wide Open 
rock, sand, and cement. In combination with the oxygen in water, the three 
dry elements bond together to make good old-fashioned concrete. You know, 
the stuff with cracks — the cracks you’re always trying to patch.
By the way, although Portland cement was purportedly invented by Joseph 
Aspdin, a builder in Leeds, England, who obtained a patent for it in 1824, the 
use of cementing materials goes back to the ancient Egyptians and Romans. 
It is said to have been dubbed “Portland cement” due to its resemblance to 
limestone found on the Isle of Portland, England.
The following sections explain how to perform common concrete mainte-
nance and repair tasks.
Cleaning off grease and oil stains
You probably let your vehicle rest in a garage, carport, or driveway when 
you’re not driving it. Depending upon the mechanical condition of your vehi-
cle, oil and grease spots soon begin to decorate the concrete in these areas. If 
this situation sounds familiar, you’ll be pleased to know that we have a clean-
up formula for you — a couple of formulas actually, depending upon the 
severity of the stains. In either case, wait until the area is shaded to prevent 
the cleaning solution from drying out too quickly.
Plan A: Using our Soda-Pop Concrete Stain Remover
This first formula may cause your neighbors to wonder whether you’re play-
ing with a full deck of cards. However, you’ll soon be the envy of the neigh-
borhood when you have the cleanest driveway on the block.
Gather the following items:
 
✓ A small bag of cat litter
 
✓ A few cans of a cola beverage (diet or regular)
 
✓ A nylon brush or stiff-bristle broom
 
✓ A mixing bucket
 
✓ Powdered laundry detergent (ammonia free)
 
✓ Liquid chlorine bleach
 
✓ Eye protection and rubber gloves
 
✓ A garden hose and running water

317
 Chapter 17: Walkways, Patios, and Driveways
Then follow these steps:
 
1. Completely cover the grease or oil with a thin layer of the cat litter 
and grind it in using the soles of your shoes.
 
2. Sweep up the cat litter and pour on enough cola beverage to cover the 
entire area.
 
 Don’t just throw the oil and grease-laden cat litter in the garbage can — 
dispose of it as you would used motor oil, paint, or other potentially hazard-
ous chemicals. If you’re not sure how to dispose of such materials, call your 
local waste-management company for advice about the rules in your area.
 
3. Work the cola into the affected area with a scrub brush or bristle 
broom, making sure to keep the entire area damp with cola. Then 
leave it on for about 20 minutes or until it has stopped fizzing, but 
don’t permit it to dry.
 
4. Rinse off the cola with fresh water.
 
 You should see a gray stain.
 
5. Scrub the gray stain with a solution of 1 cup liquid chlorine bleach, 1 
cup powdered laundry detergent, and 1 gallon of very hot water.
 
 Make sure the detergent you use is ammonia free. Mixing ammonia with 
bleach creates a lethal gas, similar to mustard gas.
Plan B: Muriatic acid
If Plan A (see the preceding section) doesn’t do the trick, then it’s time to bring 
out the big gun — muriatic acid. Make a solution of one part muriatic acid to 
nine parts water, adding the acid to the water (not the other way around).
 
Working with muriatic acid is dangerous! Wear eye protection, put on rubber 
gloves to protect your hands and arms, and make sure that there’s plenty of 
ventilation. Do not attempt this project when children or animals are present.
After you carefully mix the acid solution, follow these steps:
 
1. Pour the solution over the area and work it in using a nylon scrub 
brush or stiff-bristle broom.
 
 Be careful not to splash — you don’t want to damage the surrounding area.
 
2. Flush the entire area with fresh water after the solution has stopped 
fizzing — about ten minutes.
 
 More than one treatment may be necessary for those stains that only 
professional race-car drivers can appreciate.

By the way, just before you clean your concrete is the perfect time to get that 
leaky engine fixed!
Cleaning up mildew: No slip slidin’ away
Mildew is a fungus that grows as a surface mold on virtually any material 
(inside and outside of the home). Dormant mildew spores are in the air 
almost everywhere, and all they need to develop and prosper is a warm, 
damp environment, which they often find on your concrete.
In addition to its potential for causing falls, its unsightly appearance, and its 
often fierce odor, medical studies have shown that mildew can cause a vari-
ety of physical ailments as well, including respiratory problems, headaches, 
nausea, fevers, backaches, high blood pressure, and fatigue.
Many years ago, we discovered a foolproof formula to clean off mildew on all 
kinds of surfaces. This formula was developed by the same agency that gave 
us the $750 toilet seat — the U.S. government! Actually, credit should go to 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Forest Products Laboratory. Although 
this formula has no problem zapping mildew on concrete, it can also be used 
on any (non-colorfast) painted or washable surface, inside or outside.
To use this all-surface, easy mildew remover, follow these steps:
 
1. Add 1 quart liquid chlorine bleach to 3 quarts warm water; then add 
1/3 cup powered laundry detergent.
 
 Even though this solution is mild, make certain to wear safety goggles 
and rubber gloves, and have plenty of ventilation.
 
 Use ammonia-free detergent. You never want to mix bleach with ammo-
nia because the combination of the two creates a lethal gas.
 
2. Apply the solution to the affected areas using the broom.
 
 Leave the mixture on long enough for the black or green stains to turn 
white, but don’t allow it to dry — 15 minutes should be long enough.
 
3. Rinse the entire area with fresh water.
 
Ponding water is a primary source of mildew, so to prevent the return of 
mildew, make sure that you have good drainage off of your concrete surfaces. 
And because sunlight is a major enemy to mildew, prune and thin trees and 
shrubbery that shelter concrete surfaces. Proper cleaning helps fight the 
battle against mildew, while taking preventive steps helps win the war!

Patching cracks
Aside from sprucing up the exterior appearance of your house, repairing 
cracks and holes in concrete also prevents water damage and improves 
safety. Cracks in concrete can allow water to travel into areas where it isn’t 
invited — like a crawlspace or your basement, which can wreak havoc. 
Furthermore, cracks, potholes, and uneven concrete are notorious causes of 
nasty falls. Did you ever stop to think that a little concrete maintenance could 
keep you out of court as the defendant in a personal-injury case?
Frequently, extensive or severe cracks in concrete are the result of a soil 
condition that needs attention. For example, an inordinate amount of water 
may exist in the soil beside or below a path or foundation, causing the soil to 
expand and the concrete to crack. All the cosmetic crack repairs in the world 
won’t correct a drainage problem like that, one that probably will result in 
more severe damage if left uncorrected. Address excessive moisture due to 
over-watering or poor drainage before making any crack repairs. Standing 
water, mold- and mildew-laden walls and siding, cracks in walks and walls, 
and difficult-to-open doors and windows are telltale signs of poor drainage.
After you take care of any long-standing drainage needs, turn to Chapter 4 
for instructions on patching concrete using one of our favorite tools — vinyl 
concrete patch.
Turning up the pressure clean
When tough stains aren’t the issue, and you just 
want to give your concrete a good once-over 
cleaning, use a pressure washer to eliminate 
the required elbow grease. You can clean just 
about anything with a pressure washer, includ-
ing roofing, siding, window screens, decking, 
fencing, cars, boats‚ even concrete! You name 
it, a pressure washer will blast it clean.
Today, most home-improvement retailers stock a 
full line of pressure washers that range from what 
we classify as “toys” to heavy-duty, industrial-
strength models. For a few hundred dollars, you 
can get all the power you need. When shopping 
for a pressure washer, consider the following:
 ✓ The means by which the tool is powered — 
either by gas or electricity: We prefer the 
freedom that the gas models offer; they 
eliminate the need to string electrical cords, 
especially when working in the back-40, 
pressure-washing a fence. The disadvan-
tage of a gas model is that you need to fuss 
with gasoline and oil.
 ✓ How much power you want: Pressure 
washers are rated in cleaning units, or CUs. 
The more cleaning units, the more powerful 
the machine. A CU rating of 2,000 to 9,000 
units is ample for virtually any do-it-yourself 
household-cleaning task.

Got a small crack in a highly visible place? Using a masonry drill and a tube of 
clear or gray silicone caulk, you can easily mix up a concrete patching com-
pound that will leave the crack virtually invisible. Follow these steps:
 
1. Gather some concrete dust from your driveway.
 
 Find an out-of-the-way spot in your cracked patio or step, such as just 
below the grade. Place a small, flat, metal pan underneath where you 
plan to drill. Use a masonry drill bit to drill a hole in the hidden area, 
and collect the dust coming out of the hole.
 
2. Apply a bead of caulk to the top of the crack you want to repair.
 
3. While the caulk is still fresh, sprinkle the masonry dust over the crack 
and work it into the caulk with your finger.
 
4. Sweep away the excess dust and — voilà! — no more crack!
Only banana peels should cause 
slips and falls on concrete
If your concrete is clean, but it’s still slippery 
when wet, you should slightly etch the surface 
using a 25 percent solution of muriatic acid. The 
acid removes a very, very thin layer of cement, 
which exposes the sand in the concrete, creat-
ing a rougher surface. The finish is similar to 
medium- to fine-grit sandpaper.
Simply pour the solution onto the concrete and 
let it stand for approximately 15 minutes before 
flushing the entire area with water. Allow the con-
crete to dry to determine if the new finish meets 
your expectations. More than one application 
may be required to achieve a coarser surface.
Warning: Muriatic acid is dangerous stuff! 
Refer to “Plan B: Muriatic acid,” earlier in this 
chapter, for safety information you’ll need when 
working with muriatic acid.
On steps, consider installing peel-and-stick, 
nonskid tread tape. You can purchase the tape 
by the foot in various widths at most home-
improvement retailers. If the nonskid tread tape 
doesn’t appeal to you, consider the newest kid 
on the block: a nonskid material that can be 
painted onto a surface. The result is essentially 
the same. The main difference is that, with the 
painted-on variety, you can customize the size 
by using masking tape and applying the mate-
rial within the perimeter of the tape.

 Chapter 17: Walkways, Patios, and Driveways
Sealing concrete
Concrete is quite porous and acts like a sponge. When temperatures drop and 
concrete is wet, it can freeze, causing cracking and spalling (chipping). Rock 
salt used to melt snow is another primary source of deterioration of concrete.
You can minimize this damage by periodically sealing the concrete with an 
acrylic or silicone-based concrete and masonry sealer. A liquid concrete 
sealer prevents water absorption by filling the pores of the concrete. A con-
crete sealer lasts for six months to a year, depending upon the quality of the 
material, surface preparation, and climate.
 
Inexpensive “water seals” don’t offer the level of protection that some of the 
pricier products do. Moreover, poor-quality sealers need to be applied again 
and again, and can end up costing more money in the long run.
You apply concrete sealers with a brush, roller, or pump garden sprayer. 
Before you begin, clean the concrete using the concrete cleaning tips men-
tioned earlier in this chapter.
Concrete childhood lessons
Like many children, we walked to and from 
school. Unlike our parents, we didn’t have to walk 
10 miles uphill both ways through sleet, snow, 
high winds, and what-have-you. However, we did 
have to drag ourselves a good honest mile.
Walking to and from school was one of our 
favorite parts of the day. We went from store to 
store along the main street in our little town, greet-
ing each shopkeeper, and admired the wares. 
Because candy and toys were our favorites, we 
allowed extra time for the toy store and the corner 
drugstore. Believe it or not, we even found time to 
pop into the local hardware store, although it was 
off the beaten path. You see, our fascination with 
tools and building stuff began at a tender age.
Aside from window-shopping, one of our favor-
ite diversions was a game that involved the lines 
and cracks in the concrete sidewalk, and how 
to avoid stepping on them — at all costs. If we 
stepped on a line, it would break our mother’s 
spine, and if we stepped on a crack, it would 
surely break her back. Fortunately, although we 
accidentally set foot on many a line and crack, 
Mom’s back never suffered in the least.
As adults, we’ve learned that cracks in con-
crete don’t break your mother’s back, but they 
can be the cause of a nasty fall. Yikes! A little 
concrete maintenance from time to time can 
save big time on repair bills and perhaps even 
doctor bills.

322
Part V: Out in the Great Wide Open 
 
You can minimize damage caused by rock salt by rinsing the area with hot 
water to remove the majority of salt. Of course, unless you live in a temperate 
climate, you have to wait until spring to do this task.
Painting your concrete
Paint remains a popular finish for concrete porches, patios, paths, garages, 
carports, and basements. Painting concrete is a great idea — if the paint will 
stick to the concrete. You can increase the stick-to-itiveness with thorough 
cleaning and prep, but there are certain conditions — such as moisture — 
over which you simply don’t have control. Hydrostatic pressure (moisture 
wicking up from below the concrete) can prevent even the best of finishes 
from sticking.
 
You can determine whether moisture is a problem by taping a 1-foot-square 
piece of plastic (such as a garbage bag) to the concrete. Leave it there at least 
24 hours, and then remove it. If a damp spot appears where the plastic was 
placed or there is condensation on the underside of the plastic, paint won’t 
stick. Consider using a clear acrylic concrete sealer (see the preceding sec-
tion) or latex concrete stain (see “Staining your concrete — intentionally,” 
later in this chapter), both of which allow moisture vapors to escape, thus 
improving the odds that the finish will stick.
Types of concrete paint
Three basic types of paint are available for concrete:
 
✓ Latex: Latex paint is the most widely used. It has excellent adhesion 
properties, allows water vapor to escape (prohibiting blistering and 
peeling), and is the most user-friendly to apply because it cleans up 
with water.
 
✓ Oil-based paints: Oil-based paints are still a favorite for porches and 
patios. They offer a harder, shinier, and more abrasion-resistant finish.
 
✓ Epoxy: Epoxy is the crème de la crème of concrete paint. It’s the most 
durable and longest lasting. Epoxy is especially popular in basements as 
a means of controlling dampness. Epoxy paints generally consist of two 
parts which, when combined, create a chemical reaction that results in 
an above-average bond and highly abrasion-resistant finish.
Unfortunately, chemists haven’t yet developed a paint that won’t eventually 
sustain damage from the hot tires of cars. Over time, all types of concrete 
paint will bubble, peel, or chip when they suffer the wear and tear of car tires.

323
 Chapter 17: Walkways, Patios, and Driveways
Doing the job right
Don’t be in a hurry to paint freshly poured concrete. For best adhesion, let 
the concrete cure for 60 to 90 days before painting. Existing concrete is ready 
to go when you are.
Here are the step-by-step instructions:
 
1. If necessary, remove any flaking, peeling paint on previously painted 
surfaces, using a chemical remover, sandblaster, or mechanical abrader.
 
2. Clean the surface.
 
 Grit, grease, oil, and other contaminants inhibit the paint from sticking. 
(For cleaning instructions, see our concrete cleaning tips earlier in this 
chapter.
 
 If you have rust stains on your concrete, try using a concrete cleaner 
that contains phosphoric acid. You can buy it in liquid or jelly form.
 
3. Lightly etch the surface using a 25 percent solution of muriatic acid.
 
 Etching helps the paint stick better. Simply pour the solution onto the 
concrete, spread it out evenly, and let it stand for approximately 15 
minutes. Then flush the entire area with water. (See the sidebar “Only 
banana peels should cause slips and falls on concrete” for more informa-
tion on working with this acid.)
 
4. Using a medium-to-long-nap roller cover and a nylon/polyester brush 
or paint pad to cut in the edges, apply concrete floor paint using the 
method required by the type of paint you choose:
 
• Latex paint: Most latex concrete floor paints are designed to be 
applied directly to raw concrete. Apply a first coat as a primer and 
a second coat to get a full and uniform finish.
 
• Oil-based paint: These paints should be applied over a coat of oil-
based concrete or masonry filler/primer (thin the primer slightly 
using mineral spirits to enhance the penetration and improve the 
bond). (Note: You can apply an oil-based paint over an existing 
oil finish, as long as the existing finish is clean and has been de-
glossed with tri-sodium-phosphate [TSP] or a similar liquid paint 
de-glosser.) After the primer dries, apply the finish coat. Use min-
eral spirits for cleanup.
 
• Epoxy paints: Epoxy typically comes in two parts that you mix 
together prior to application. The mixture creates a chemical reac-
tion that makes the finish bond with the concrete for a long-lasting, 
durable finish.

324
Part V: Out in the Great Wide Open 
 
Compared to other, more-forgiving finishes, the surface prep must be espe-
cially thorough when using epoxy, so be sure to follow steps 1 through 3 to 
the letter. There isn’t much of a margin of error when it comes to working with 
epoxy.
Two to three coats of epoxy — with about 16 hours of dry time between 
coats — should provide a finish that will outlast you. Read the instructions 
on the package for specific application instructions.
 
Whatever type of paint you use, don’t clean the surface one weekend and 
apply the paint the next. You don’t want a week’s worth of dirt and contamina-
tion to ruin the new coat of paint.
For extra protection, use paint that contains a mildewcide (a fungicide that 
prevents mildew and other fungi from growing on painted surfaces). Although 
mildewcide is added to many paints during manufacturing, you can add it 
after the fact if the paint you’re using doesn’t contain it — just ask about your 
options wherever you buy paint.
Staining your concrete — intentionally
Besides concrete floor paints, there also are concrete stains. Concrete stains 
are much thinner than paint so they penetrate the surface more thoroughly 
for better adhesion. When dry, stained concrete resembles pigmented con-
crete rather than a painted finish. On the other hand, because it’s so thin, 
concrete stain is not nearly as abrasion-resistant as concrete paint, so it must 
be applied more frequently. Dang!
As with painting prep, the concrete should be cleaned and lightly acid-washed 
for maximum penetration (refer to steps 1 through 3 in the preceding section). 
Then mix the stain in a 5-gallon bucket and mop or roll it onto the concrete.
Repairing concrete steps
Patching crumbling concrete steps enhances the appearance and safety of 
your home for a fraction of the cost of new stairs. And the best part is that 
it’s a task that most do-it-yourselfers can handle with ease.
As the weakest point of construction, the step’s edge is most vulnerable to 
damage. Expansive soil, freeze and thaw cycles, efflorescence (a white pow-
dery substance that results from mineral salts leaching to the surface of con-
crete; see Chapter 4), and deterioration from salt and traffic are a few of the 
causes of crumbling concrete stairs.

325
 Chapter 17: Walkways, Patios, and Driveways
 
Crumbling steps frequently result from what were once small cracks that 
were not tended to. You can prevent most of the damage to steps by caulking, 
which allows the concrete to expand and contract yet prevents moisture from 
entering the area.
To repair concrete stairs, you need these supplies:
 
✓ Sledgehammer
 
✓ Cold chisel
 
✓ Safety goggles
 
✓ Mixing container
 
✓ Shovel
Memories from our little red porch
We grew up in a home built around the turn of 
the 20th century by our boat-builder-turned-
contractor grandfather. Several generations 
were raised in that home. It boasted traditional 
Mediterranean architecture, a reflection of our 
grandfather’s European roots.
Much to our chagrin, our old family home is no 
longer. It was sacrificed in the name of prog-
ress. (Our city called it “urban renewal.”) Out 
with the old, in with the new. A significant piece 
of the hearts and souls of all the members of our 
family died the day that our old family home fell 
prey to the ravenous jaws of the indiscriminate 
bulldozer. All that remains some 25 years later 
are memories, fond memories.
Our home stood proud among those in our 
neighborhood. It consisted of a towering (from 
the eyes of children) two stories with a large 
basement. The building had a beige dashed 
plaster exterior, a red S-shaped tile roof, and 
vast archways flanked by stately sculpted col-
umns. There were lots of windows, a multi-light 
radius-top entry door, generous architectural 
ornamentation, two spacious verandas at the 
second floor, and an ample front porch that was 
the first to greet each visitor to our home.
Some of the most vivid memories of our old 
home took place on that front porch. Many a 
family gathering was held there. Although the 
arid climate necessitated it, air conditioning was 
something reserved for more modern homes. 
Instead, we sought refuge from the sweltering 
heat swinging to and fro on the canvas-clad 
bench swing.
The porch, located a half-dozen steps above 
the street, was constructed of concrete and 
finished with a deep red paint. It was that porch 
wherein we had our first experience with paint-
ing. It needed a fresh coat every few years. How 
rewarding it was to admire our workmanship 
and to enjoy praise from the family!
We’ll never forget that handsome red porch at 
our old family home. It’s been 30 years since its 
last painting and, in our minds, it’s as bright and 
fresh-looking as the day it was last painted.

✓ Garden hose
 
✓ Concrete finishing trowel
 
✓ Wooden float (a wooden trowel used to tamp and work the concrete into 
place)
 
✓ Small piece of 3/4-inch plywood to act as a form board
 
✓ Concrete bonding agent
 
✓ Ready-to-mix concrete patch material (or epoxy patch material)
 
✓ Tarp or plastic sheeting
 
✓ 1 quart of clean motor oil or concrete form-release oil
 
✓ At least four bricks (more may be needed)
Follow these steps to get your steps feet-worthy:
 
1. Remove the loose and crumbling concrete with a sledgehammer and 
cold chisel. (Be sure to wear safety goggles!) Then sweep up all the 
debris and clean the area with the strong spray of a garden hose.
 
 Isn’t it just like a home fix-it expert to suggest breaking something the 
rest of the way before making a repair? It seems paradoxical, but to suc-
cessfully repair a concrete stair — or anything else made of concrete — 
you must first completely remove all loose pieces and make sure that 
what remains is solid.
 
2. Paint the raw patch area with a concrete bonding agent and allow it 
to set up for about 15 minutes.
 
 The bonding agent is a glue that helps the new patch material adhere to 
the old, cured concrete.
 
3. Use a circular saw or handsaw to cut a scrap piece of plywood equal 
to the height of the step and a few inches longer than the damaged 
area at either end.
 
 You’ll set this form board flush against the face of the step to hold the 
concrete patch material into place until it’s fully cured.
 
4. Apply a light coat of clean motor oil or form release oil on the surface 
of the form board facing the concrete to prevent the form from stick-
ing and damaging the patch when removed.
 
5. Place the form flush against the face of the steps for a smooth patch.
 
 The bottom of the form board should fit flat against the top of the step 
below.
 
6. Use several bricks to hold the form boards firmly in place (see 
Figure 17-1).

7. Mix the concrete patch material.
 
 Vinyl concrete patch and polymer cement are the most popular con-
crete patching products because they’re easy to use and they blend well 
with the old material. Though more expensive, epoxy patch material is 
the best money can buy. It’s stronger and holds better — the result of 
a chemical reaction among the ingredients of the adhesive. The consis-
tency of the patch material should be loose, but not runny.
 
8. Using the wood float, pack the material firmly into the area, being 
sure to eliminate any air pockets.
 
 The butt end of the float works great for this.
 
9. Remove excess patch material with a wooden float and finish the 
patch to match the surrounding concrete with a metal concrete 
trowel.
 
10. When the material starts to set up (in approximately 10 to 30 min-
utes), cover it with a tarp or sheet of plastic.
 
 Doing so holds moisture in. If the material dries too fast, it may crack or 
not adhere securely.

 Most exterior concrete surfaces have a slightly rough finish to prevent 
slipping when wet. The most common finish is the broom finish. After 
the patch has become firm, brush it lightly once (and just once) with a 
broom. Or, for a small patch, use a stiff paintbrush.
 
11. Until the patch has completely dried (which can take up to a week), 
remove the cover once a day and spray the patch with a fine mist of 
water and then replace the cover.
 
 Leave the form board in place during the drying process to reduce the 
prospect of damage resulting from form removal or foot traffic.
 
12. Complete the job by carefully removing the form boards, stakes, and 
bricks.
Getting Things on an Even Keel
If you walk across your brick or stone path or patio and you feel as if you’re 
on a ship on the high seas, chances are good that a little leveling is in order. 
Unlike a poured-in-place concrete path or patio that might need to be jack-
hammered out, a brick or stone patio is one big jigsaw puzzle embedded in 
a layer of sand. Consequently, this is a project that you can easily do your-
self by selectively removing pieces of the puzzle, shoring up the sub-base, 
and reinstalling the pieces. The real beauty of this project is that it can be 
done a section at a time, and you can take as long as you want to complete 
your work. It’s not like you have a slab of wet concrete that must be finished 
before it dries hard as a rock! A few tools and a little time and it’ll be smooth 
sailing.
Leveling settled brick 
patios and walkways
As a couple we know demonstrated when the repair of their sinking brick 
patio was featured on Ask This Old House, leveling and resetting a brick patio 
is slow, heavy work. Fortunately, it’s not a complex project — just one that 
takes time and effort to do right.
You need the following:
 
✓ Chalk
 
✓ Crayon

329
 Chapter 17: Walkways, Patios, and Driveways
 
✓ Small pry bar
 
✓ Shovel
 
✓ Hand tamper
 
✓ Rubber mallet
 
✓ 4-foot level
 
✓ Measuring tape
 
✓ Broom
 
✓ Crushed limestone
 
✓ Coarse sand
 
✓ Fine sand
Then follow these steps:
 
1. Use chalk to mark out the settled area.
 
2. Starting in the middle of that area and working toward the edge, use 
a small pry bar to remove the whole bricks and stack them neatly 
nearby.
 
3. Number any partial, cut bricks using a light-colored crayon.
 
 Don’t use chalk — it’ll rub off and make resetting a nightmare.
 
4. When all the settled area’s bricks are removed, explore what’s 
underneath.
 
 You should find sand. And under that you may find crushed limestone 
or compacted gravel. But it’s more likely that you’ll find dirt or clay 
underneath.
 
5. If you find dirt or clay that’s wet or loose underneath the brick, dig it 
out until you find solid earth.
 
6. Fill the now-low areas of the bed with crushed limestone and compact 
it thoroughly using a hand tamper.
 
 Your wrists and hands will never be the same!
 
7. Use a level to see where the top of the reset bricks will be; then use 
more crushed limestone (tamp it down good!) to fill the bed until 
there are 3 inches between the bottom of the level and the top of 
the bed.
 
 Most patio bricks are 2 inches thick, and you want to leave room for 1 
inch of sand underneath.

330
Part V: Out in the Great Wide Open 
 
8. Add 1 inch of sand, and then double-check that you still have 2 inches 
for the bricks.
 
9. Reset the bricks you removed earlier, working from the middle out-
ward. Be careful to maintain the original pattern.
 
 Be sure to put them in straight down to avoid jamming sand between 
them and messing up the spacing. Whack each brick hard a couple of 
times with a rubber mallet to make sure they’re securely set.
 
10. Sweep fine sand into the joints to fill the gaps and to lock the now-
level bricks in place.
 
 Save some sand to sweep in after the next rain.
Leveling and resetting stone paths
The process for fixing a sinking, uneven brick sidewalk or stone path is the 
same as it is for a settled patio (see the preceding section). However, in our 
experience, you’re more likely to find just dirt underneath. Our advice when 
you find no stabilizing stone/sand base: Pull the whole thing up and start 
fresh with a proper substrate. That way you won’t have to fix it again in two 
years . . . and then every two years after that.
Recoating an asphalt driveway
Few home-maintenance projects are easier than sealing an asphalt driveway. 
Mostly you need a strong back to maneuver the big, heavy buckets of sealer.
You need these supplies:
 
✓ Putty knife
 
✓ Broom
 
✓ Clean and sturdy stirring stick
 
✓ Squeegee or roller
 
✓ Hose
 
✓ Asphalt caulk
 
✓ Asphalt patch
 
✓ Asphalt sealer

331
 Chapter 17: Walkways, Patios, and Driveways
When you’ve gathered everything you need, follow these steps:
 
1. Check the weather forecast to make sure the temperature will stay 
above 50 degrees and there’ll be no rain for the next 36 hours.
 
 Cool temperatures and excessive moisture interfere with adhesion and 
drying.
 
2. Remove debris from any large cracks using a putty knife, and thor-
oughly sweep the entire surface with a push broom.
 
3. Fill all cracks more than 1/4 inch wide with asphalt caulk.
 
 You need to use asphalt patching material to patch bigger cracks. 
Smaller cracks can be filled by the sealer.
 
4. Prepare the surface by spraying it with water to remove any dust. 
Clean oil spots using one of the methods described in the “Cleaning 
off grease and oil stains” section, earlier in this chapter.
 
5. Allow the driveway to fully dry.
 
6. Get the sealer ready.
 
 Drag the big, heavy buckets of sealer onto the driveway. Without 
opening them, flip them upside-down to allow the heavier goop to sink 
toward the top; then flip them back, crack them open, and stir thor-
oughly with a sturdy, clean stick. Put the lid back on the now-stirred 
sealer and drag one of the big, heavy buckets of sealer to your starting 
point.
 
7. Pour out only as much sealer as will coat about 20 square feet (you’ll 
figure out how much that is pretty quickly); then use the roller or 
squeegee to spread the coating across the driveway using overlapping 
strokes.
 
 Two things to keep in mind as you apply the sealer:
 
• Stir the sealer as you apply it to ensure its consistency.
 
• A thick coat is not better than a thin coat.
 
8. Keep dragging the big, heavy buckets around and doing 20 square 
feet at a time until you’re done.
 
 Be careful not to slop sealer onto the sidewalk or street.
 
9. Let the sealer dry for at least 24 hours, and preferably 48 hours.
 
 During the drying time, stay off the driveway. Put the empty buckets at 
the end of the driveway to prevent visitors from driving on your freshly 
coated and very, very handsome driveway.

For the Love of Masonry
One of our favorite children’s stories is “The Three Little Pigs.” In fact, we 
credit, to some degree, our early interest in construction to our early interest 
in that book. After all, the story is about three pigs who delve in to construc-
tion as owner-builders. And like most construction projects, they had their 
share of headaches. Enter the Big Bad Wolf! Obsessed with having a delec-
table ham dinner, he tried to destroy the pigs’ homes.
Sadly, he was successful in demolishing the first two homes — constructed of 
straw and wood, respectively. However, the third little pig used brick to build 
his home, which foiled the wolf. Huff and puff all he might, the wolf couldn’t 
blow down the house built of bricks. And he wouldn’t have been any more 
successful with a home built of stone.
The only difference between brick and stone: Reinforced brick is structural, 
and stone is primarily decorative. However, when it comes to cleaning, 
repairing, and sealing, the techniques and materials used for brick and stone 
are the same.
We have yet to see a real, live wolf attempt to blow down a house. But efflo-
rescence, salt air, stress cracks, and severe weathering can be as big a threat. 
Chapter 4 tells you how to deal with efflorescence. The following sections 
explain how to handle the other problems.
Dealing with stress cracks
Stress cracks typically occur in mortar joints rather than within the brick or 
stone itself. If stress cracks in mortar are the problem, see Chapter 4 for the 
lowdown on tuck-pointing.
If the problem is a cracked or broken stone or brick, you can remove it by 
chiseling out the mortar surrounding it. With the mortar out of the way, the 
brick or stone will have room to expand and can be broken up easily using a 
cold chisel and a small sledgehammer. Just insert a new brick or stone into 
the hole to replace the one removed. Then finish the job by mortaring around 
the brick or stone for a solid fit.
 
When a new mortar patch dries and doesn’t match the existing shade or 
color, have a small amount of latex paint color-matched to the existing 
mortar. Use an artist’s brush to paint the new mortar joints. No one will 
ever know where the existing material ends and the new work begins — 
including you!

 Chapter 17: Walkways, Patios, and Driveways
Cleaning your masonry
The most common masonry-cleaning problems are:
 
✓ Fungus, moss, and mildew: One quart of household liquid bleach mixed 
into 1 gallon of warm water, applied with a stiff-bristle brush, usually takes 
care of these unsightly problems. (Don’t forget to rinse the solution off 
with clean water.) However, sodium hypochlorite, the active ingredient in 
bleach, may not dissolve large masses of these types of growths. In such 
cases, scrape off as much of the crud as you can with a broad-bladed 
putty knife (or wire brush); then scrub on the killer mixture.
 
 When trying to eliminate fungus, it’s the bleach that does the job — not 
the elbow grease. Make sure you give the bleach plenty of time to work 
before scrubbing and rinsing away. If not, fungus spores will remain and 
can grow back quickly.
 
✓ Oils, soot, and mineral residue: Oils, soot, and white, powdery mineral 
residue pose a slightly more difficult problem. They’re embedded more 
deeply than moss or mildew into the pores of the masonry. You need a 
solution of 1 part muriatic acid to 9 parts water to get rid of this hard-to-
remove crud. Add the acid to the water and apply the solution; allow it 
to set for about 15 minutes; then use a bristle brush to clean the affected 
area and rinse with fresh water. (If soot is the problem, head to Chapter 15 
for ideas on how to get rid of it.)
 
✓ Paint: Sandblasting, wash-away, or peel-off paint removers; hand or elec-
tric wire brushing; muriatic acid washing; and power-washing are just a few 
of the ways that you can remove paint from masonry. Sandblasting or wire 
brushing is hard, messy work, and paint removers sometimes create more 
mess than they eliminate. Instead, we recommend power-washing. You can 
rent a commercial power washer for about $50 per day. It’s easy to operate, 
mess is kept to a minimum, and you don’t have to be a chemist to make it 
work. Be aware, however, that a power washer works fine on the outside 
of your home, but all that water could wreak havoc on the inside of your 
house. Therefore, when it comes to removing paint from brick or stone, 
your best bet is a chemical stripper such as Peel Away (see Chapter 15).
Applying a sealer
Applying a sealer can minimize brick or stone damage from salt air and 
severe weathering. It can even work to prevent efflorescence. Just as you 
would with concrete, you need to thoroughly clean your brick and stone 
before applying a sealer. See “Sealing concrete” earlier in this chapter for 
information on what you need to perform this task.

Decks, Fences, and 
Retaining Walls
In This Chapter
▶ Doing right by your deck
▶ Taking care of fencing
▶ Maintaining your retaining wall’s health
E
ventually, everything on the planet deteriorates. However, some building 
materials last longer than others. For example, stone, brick, plaster, con-
crete, and aluminum (discussed elsewhere in this book) last a long time and 
require little or no maintenance. On the other hand, wood and wood-based 
composites must be regularly maintained and protected with paint or a pre-
servative to achieve lasting quality. Why? Because wood is highly susceptible 
to damage caused by moisture and the sun’s ultraviolet rays, whereas the 
other building materials aren’t nearly as fragile.
So given wood’s need for maintenance, why is it used in building construc-
tion? Simple: Wood is beautiful, available, very inexpensive (compared to all 
the alternatives), and really easy to work with.
Because of wood’s susceptibility to fungus and rot, and its need for regular 
and ongoing maintenance, we discuss wood maintenance in great detail in 
this chapter. You can easily deal with wood’s shortcomings and prolong the 
life of your wood structures with the information in this chapter.
 
Chapter 5 explains how to care for wood siding. This chapter focuses on other 
outdoor wood structures. Although you use many of the same principles and 
techniques to care for outdoor wood structures that you use to care for wood 
siding, the structures discussed here are more difficult to protect because 
each structure contains many pieces of wood, each piece having more than 
one side exposed to the elements.

336
Part V: Out in the Great Wide Open 
Preserving Wood
Wood is wood and whether the wood is used for a deck, a fence, a gazebo, 
or a retaining wall, there is one common fact: Wood and water don’t mix. 
Fortunately, you can protect your wood structures in a number of ways, as 
the following sections explain.
 
Anything that contains wood must be treated like wood. Some manufacturers 
of composite materials would like you to believe that their products require 
no maintenance, but that’s just not the case. Wood composites are basically 
wood chips mixed with a resin. After one or two greasy barbecue spills, you’ll 
find that composite decking stains just like the real McCoy. Composite sur-
faces do seem to hold up better in the beginning, and they don’t splinter the 
way natural wood does, but composite materials can’t be refinished. (That 
won’t become important until at least ten years down the road, when replace-
ment is your only choice.) Composite wood should be protected with pen-
etrating oil (a wood preservative), just as solid wood should.
Paint
A painted deck or fence can be beautiful, but painting can also be a real prob-
lem. Unlike wood siding, wood in decks, handrails, fences, retaining walls, 
and other complex structures expose several surfaces of each piece of wood 
to the weather. Some of the surfaces (such as the area between a fence rail 
and a fence board) are inaccessible and can’t be protected, which makes it 
difficult to achieve a complete waterproof membrane, even if you caulk.
Partially painted pieces of wood create a real problem. Even if the unpainted 
side doesn’t get wet directly, exposed wood can absorb moisture from vapors 
rising from beneath. After the exposed wood absorbs moisture, the painted 
surface on that same piece of wood can become riddled with bubbles, splits, 
chips, and peeling paint. And when the painted surface has been compro-
mised, it can no longer fully protect the wood — in fact, the damaged surface 
becomes a contributor to further moisture attack.
 
Our advice: Don’t paint unless you can cover all six sides of every piece of 
wood. In situations where pieces of wood are sandwiched together, and the 
joined surfaces can’t be painted, then the pieces should be joined as one by 
thoroughly caulking all connecting joints. If all sides can’t be reached, you’ll 
get the best protection with an oil or oil-stain finish — not with paint.
Because of the chipping, bubbling, and splitting normally associated with 
painted decks and handrails, we’re reluctant to suggest painting. However, if 
you do decide to paint, do the following:

337
 Chapter 18: Decks, Fences, and Retaining Walls
 
1. Make sure that the surface is thoroughly clean and that the wood is dry.
 
 Go to extremes to get the wood clean: pressure-washing, sanding, and 
detergent scrubbing. (Turn to Chapter 5 for cleaning instructions.)
 
2. Remove all loose nails and replace them with the next larger size.
 
 The larger nail will provide a like-new grip, holding loosened wood firmly 
in place. Use a hammer and nail punch to countersink all nails (see 
Figure 18-1). Fill the resultant nail hole with a high-quality, exterior-grade 
putty.
 
 Use a hinge pin (removed from a door hinge) as an oversized nail set — it’s 
much easier for a novice to use than a common skinny tipped nail punch.
 
Figure 18-1: 
Countersink-
ing a nail.
 
1/4 inch
 
3. Fill all other holes with a high-quality, exterior-grade putty.
 
 While you’re applying the putty, be sure to remove all excess putty to 
keep sanding to a minimum.
 
4. Apply a high-quality polyurethane caulk at all joints.
 
5. Prime all bare areas and puttied spots with a high-quality, oil-based 
primer.
 
6. Finish decks with a high-grade, oil-based finish. Handrails can be fin-
ished with a good-quality, acrylic paint.
Remember: Be prepared to recaulk and touch up paint every year.

338
Part V: Out in the Great Wide Open 
 
Never paint a wood surface that has previously been oiled. The paint won’t 
stick, and you’ll have a mess on your hands forever. After wood is oiled or oil 
stained, even the most minute spots of leftover paint show up like a headlight 
on Lover’s Lane.
If you insist on painting an oiled surface (or on oiling a painted surface), you 
must first take the time to use a paint remover followed by thoroughly sand-
ing the wood. Our advice? Repaint painted surfaces and re-oil oiled surfaces.
Preservative
One of the best ways to protect your wood surfaces is to use a high-quality, 
oil-based wood preservative — the same kind we suggest for exterior siding 
(see Chapter 5). Using an oil-based wood preservative with ultraviolet inhibi-
tors keeps wood and wood-composite surfaces looking newer longer.
Unlike paint, oil doesn’t lay on the surface; it penetrates deeply into the 
pores of the wood, preventing the attack of moisture from within. Oil also 
penetrates between joints and connections. With oil, there is no rigid surface 
layer (as there is with paint) that can bubble or split. However, oil eventually 
evaporates out of the wood, leaving it unprotected. If you use an oil preserva-
tive, you need to recoat your wood every 12 to 18 months.
 
Excessive amounts of oil can puddle, and puddled oil doesn’t dry. Plus, pud-
dling scuffs easily and can stick to furniture, feet, and shoes — meaning the 
destruction of interior floors. So when you oil horizontal surfaces (especially 
decks), take care: They’re less forgiving than vertical surfaces (such as fences, 
posts, and rails).
 
Help force the oil or oil stain into the surface by going back over the entire 
area with a paintbrush or roller (called back-brushing). A China-bristle or natu-
ral-bristle paintbrush is by far the best applicator for use with oil. Don’t use a 
nylon paintbrush with oils, oil stains, or oil-based paints.
You can also make your own wood preservative at home. You need:
 
✓ Boiled linseed oil
 
✓ Mineral spirits
 
✓ Pigment (the kind used to color paint)
 
✓ Mildicide (a pesticide that kills mildew; it’s available at paint stores)
Mix equal parts of oil and mineral spirits. Then add pigment to the intensity 
you like, and stir in a package of mildicide. (Follow the instructions for the 
mildicide as if you were adding it to an equal volume of paint.)

339
 Chapter 18: Decks, Fences, and Retaining Walls
When applying the preservative, don’t put it on too thick. A little bit goes a 
long way. Don’t forget to back-brush and wipe up any puddling. Remember: 
Oil and oil-stain puddles never dry. They turn into sticky, gummy messes that 
are nearly impossible to remove from your shoes.
 
Even the most clear of finishes slightly darken wood. To see how dark the 
wood gets, simply wet your thumb with a drop or two of water and press the 
wet appendage against the wood. The wet wood will look the same when oiled.
Stain
Choose a stain that’s designed for the surface you want to cover:
 
✓ Horizontal surfaces: Well-meaning do-it-yourselfers often end up apply-
ing stains designed for vertical surfaces (such as siding, trellises, and 
fences) on horizontal surfaces (such as decks, porches, and steps). But 
if you want to stain a horizontal surface, look for a product designed 
specifically for decks. Deck stains are made to resist scuffing where lots 
of traffic is expected.
 
 A semitransparent, oil-based stain is a good bet. The combination of oil 
and a pigment protects the wood from both sun and water and hides 
surface irregularities. Plan to spend in the neighborhood of $35 to $55 
per gallon on semitransparent, oil-based stain. A gallon covers approxi-
mately 300 to 500 square feet.
 
✓ Vertical surfaces: Stains designed for use on vertical surfaces are not 
as abrasion resistant as those made for decks. A semitransparent stain 
shows off the beauty of the wood because you can see through the stain. 
A solid-color stain won’t show through, but the solid color protects the 
wood for a longer period of time. Solid-color stain is not like paint; it 
looks like paint and acts like stain — full coverage, but without the pit-
ting, chipping, splitting or bubbling.
 
Always apply an oil or oil-stain finish (wood preservative) either early or late 
in the day when the wood is not in full sun. The thinner that helps the oil pen-
etrate evaporates quickly on hot days and can reduce the viscosity of the oil 
to a glue-like mess. Oil that’s too thick will end up laying on the surface. One to 
three very thin applications of a high-quality product may be required.
Clear finish
If you like the natural color of the wood that you want to protect, and you don’t 
want to alter its appearance, try a clear finish. Just be sure that the clear finish 
that you purchase contains UV inhibitors to fight off an ultraviolet sunburn.

340
Part V: Out in the Great Wide Open 
 
Beware of the popular “cure-all” water seals. Many of these products contain 
petroleum jelly or paraffin, which offer minimal water protection and abso-
lutely no UV protection. Furthermore, these products have little penetration 
and rapidly evaporate.
Cleaning Your Wood and Composite-
Wood Structures
Always keep a wood surface free of any debris. Leaves, pine needles, and dirt 
hold water and accelerate rot. An occasional sweeping is all that’s required. 
You can also give your wood surfaces — oiled (clear finish), oil-stained, or 
painted — a good scrubbing using the following formula:
 
✓ 1/2 cup liquid chlorine bleach (if moss is present)
 
✓ 1 gallon hot water
 
✓ 1 cup powdered laundry detergent
Add the bleach to the water, and then add the detergent.
 
Although this solution is mild, be sure to wear gloves and eye protection.
Work the solution into the surface with a stiff-bristle broom or a nylon brush. 
After scrubbing the surface, completely rinse it with water.
 
If you plan to refinish the wood after cleaning, allow the wood to completely 
dry before applying the finish. After it’s dry, countersink any nail heads that 
rise above the deck’s surface, or replace them with larger nails.
 
To get a composite-wood deck to last longer, simply keep it clean. Cleaning in 
spring and fall will reduce the chance for mold. Contact the wood-composite 
manufacturer to find out what cleaners it recommends. Some manufacturers 
suggest a household degreasing agent for oil and grease stains and good old 
household bleach for mold. In the absence of a proper cleaner, a mild deter-
gent always works.
For more-extensive cleaning measures, read on.
Power-washing
A thorough cleaning with a pressure washer (which you can rent from a paint 
store or tool-rental company) saves a lot of elbow grease and makes those 

341
 Chapter 18: Decks, Fences, and Retaining Walls
hard-to-get-to areas, like handrails and trellises, easy to clean. Pressure-
washing natural wood that has turned gray can help remove discoloration 
and can bring the wood back to its natural color.
 
We were pressure-washing a home one day, when momentarily, we became 
engrossed in conversation and got distracted. To make a long story short, 
the tip of the pressure washer got a little too close to the wall. By the time we 
turned around to pay attention to what we were doing, the high-pressure jet 
of water had cut a hole completely through a 5/8-inch-thick layer of plywood 
siding.
 
Use extreme caution when operating a pressure washer, not only to avoid 
damage to the surface of the wood but also to avoid personal injury.
Using a wood brightener
Severely neglected oiled or oil-stained wood may require washing with a 
wood-brightening product. Look for one that contains oxalic acid.
 
Apply the product with a nylon brush in accordance with the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Wear protective clothing, rubber boots, gloves, and safety gog-
gles to avoid injury.
Giving wood a facelift with sanding
If an exterior wood surface is too far gone to bring back to life with just a coat 
of paint or wood brightener and a coat of oil, then you may want to consider 
sanding. If you decide to sand it yourself, look for a power tool to help with 
the job. Large surfaces take forever to hand-sand. For a deck, rent a floor 
sander to make the job easier.
By the way, if the existing surface is painted, this would be a great time to 
completely remove it and convert to oil.
 
Countersink all nails at least 1/4-inch deep before sanding.
For a floor sander, start with 30-grit paper and work your way up to 100-grit. 
For hand sanders start with 80-grit paper and work your way up to 200-grit. 
Regardless of the type of sander, sand first cross-grain, then in both diagonal 
directions, and then, finally, in the direction of the grain.

Tightening Loose Rails, Fence 
Boards, and Fence Posts
Loose fence rails and fence boards can be a problem. A fence can suddenly 
begin flopping in the wind, looking tattered and sloppy. Reattach loose rails 
and fence boards with nails or screws.
 
Be sure to use hot-dipped galvanized (not electro-coated galvanized) nails, 
ceramic-coated construction screws, or stainless screws. Regular shiny, non-
coated nails can completely rot out in as little as a year or two.
When a fence post begins to rot at the base, the fence it supports is usually 
not long for this world. In the old days, when we were maintenance men on 
the Ark, a rotten fence post meant digging out the concrete pier surrounding 
the base of the post and replacing the whole kit and caboodle. Today, a pair 
of metal connectors, known as fence-post repair brackets, can be used to make 
such a repair.
 
Not every post can be reused. If the rot at the post base extends more than 8 
or 10 inches above the concrete pier that holds the post in the ground, then 
the post should be replaced. Also, there must be at least 3 inches of concrete 
between the edge of the fence post and the outside edge of the concrete pier.
To repair a fence post, you need only a few items:
 
✓ 1 small block of wood
 
✓ 1 piece of scrap two-by-four, about 6 inches long
 
✓ 1 pair of fence-post repair brackets
 
✓ Hammer
 
✓ Flat pry bar
 
✓ Shovel
 
✓ Sledgehammer
 
✓ A few screws or a handful of 10d-size, hot-dipped galvanized nails
Just follow these steps:
 
1. Brace the fence with the two-by-four to hold it in a plumb position 
until the repair can be completed (see Figure 18-2).
 
 Holding the fence in an upright position, wedge one end of the two-by-
four into the landscape and nail the other end of the brace to the fence 
near the post to be repaired. Don’t drive in the nail all the way. The 
brace is temporary, and you’ll have to remove the nail after you’ve made 
the repair.

343
 Chapter 18: Decks, Fences, and Retaining Walls
 
Figure 18-2: 
Bracing 
your fence 
for repair.
 
 
2. Using the hammer, remove any fence boards that cover the area to be 
repaired.
 
 Use a block of wood to buffer the blow of the hammer, which reduces 
the chance of damaging a fence board. Lay the block against the fence 
board and strike the block with the hammer. The flat pry bar can be 
helpful here.
 
3. Shovel the dirt away, exposing the base of the post and the top of the 
concrete pier.
 
 Sweep the area clean so that you can clearly see the outline of the post 
in the concrete. Attempting to drive a fence-post repair bracket in the 
wrong location can easily bend the bracket, causing the project to 
become more than an unhappy experience for everyone involved.
 
4. Use the sledgehammer to drive in the brackets.
 
 As you drive the bracket into place with the sledgehammer, it crushes 
the post and wedges itself into the concrete. The first bracket usually 
goes in pretty easily. However, the second one is more difficult to install 
because the first bracket usually uses up all the available space between 
the rotted portion of the post and the pier. Be prepared to apply more 
force to each blow of the sledgehammer to properly seat the second 
bracket.
 
5. Bolt, nail, or screw the brackets into the post.
 
 Because the brackets are tightly wedged between the pier and the post, 
the way in which you attach the bracket to the post usually is not ter-
ribly important. However, where substantial post damage exists, use 
bolts.

Wood fence posts always seem to rot in the exact same place: at ground level. 
Why not? That’s where the dirt and the water are. Make sure the earth around 
a fence post slopes down and away to help shed water and keep the post 
dryer. If you can’t do that, add a sloped concrete cap to the top of the pier. Mix 
up a small amount of ready-mix concrete and build up the top of the pier as if 
you were on the beach, building a sand castle.
Remedying Sagging Gates
A sagging wooden gate is a nuisance at best, and can, at some point, become 
impossible to open. The problem must be pretty common, because someone 
has already packaged and marketed a repair kit for exactly that purpose. It’s 
called a gate repair kit or turnbuckle kit, and it consists of a cable with corner 
mounting brackets and a turnbuckle. The nice thing about a turnbuckle kit is 
that it can be tightened or loosened to raise or lower the gate.
The kit contains:
 
✓ Two metal corner brackets with mounting nails
 
✓ Two lengths of wire cable with galvanized metal U-bolts, which are used 
to attach one end of each cable to one of the corner brackets and then 
the other end of each cable to the turnbuckle
 
✓ A galvanized metal turnbuckle
Here’s how it works:
 
1. Attach a metal bracket to the upper corner of the gate (on the hinge 
side).
 
2. Mount another bracket diagonally at the lower corner of the gate on 
the latch side.
 
3. Attach cables to each corner bracket and then to the two ends of a 
turnbuckle (see Figure 18-3).
 
 As you tighten the turnbuckle, the latch side of the gate rises. As you 
loosen the turnbuckle, the latch side of the gate drops.
 
This system won’t work if the upper bracket isn’t placed on the hinge side of 
the gate.

Termite Treachery: Protecting 
Your Wood against Critters
Termites are a universal problem. And when wood buried in the ground is 
connected to your home — regardless of whether the buried wood is pest-
resistant — that wood can act as a secret corridor from the ground to the 
interior of your home. A fence that has posts buried in the ground and is 
attached to the house, for example, can act as a termite superhighway.
To protect your home from a secret attack by termites, do the following:
 
✓ Add a layer of sheet metal at the point where the wood and the house 
intersect.
 
✓ Wherever possible, remove dirt away from wood. The general rule is 
to aim for 6 inches between the wood and the dirt. Remove enough soil 
to eliminate contact, making it more difficult for termites to penetrate 
wood structures.
 
✓ Treat wood that has been exposed to moisture in dirt with a pesti-
cide (such as zinc napthinate), which can be applied with a brush or 
sprayed on. Pesticides help deter termites and help prevent rot.

346
Part V: Out in the Great Wide Open 
 
Dirt is a world filled with tiny little insects (and some big ones, too!) and lots 
of moisture. Wood and water don’t mix, and wood surrounded by dirt for any 
length of time simply rots.
Extending the Life of a 
Wood Retaining Wall
A wood retaining wall often doesn’t get noticed until it begins to topple. The 
first thing we hear when someone calls us about maintenance is “Gee, the 
Great Wall of China has stood straight and tall for centuries.” Our response 
is, “Yeah, but the Leaning Tower of Pisa is just about ready to fall over. It all 
depends on the construction, doesn’t it?”
Wood retaining walls are considered temporary, but you can improve their 
life expectancy by keeping the wood as dry as possible. To keep your retain-
ing wall dry, follow these steps:
 
1. Dig a 6- to 12-inch-wide trench between the retaining wall and the hill 
it supports.
 
 The trench should go to the bottom of the retaining wall.
 
2. Line the bottom and both sides of the trench with burlap cloth.
 
3. Place 6 inches of drain rock over the burlap in the bottom of the trench.
 
4. Install a 4-inch perforated drainpipe (perforations down) over the first 
layer of rock.
 
 The drainpipe should daylight (come out of the ground) at some point 
beyond the end of the retaining wall. If possible, extend the pipe so that 
it drains directly into the public storm-drain system.
 
5. Fill the rest of the trench with drain rock to within 6 inches of the top 
of the dirt being retained.
 
6. Cover the rock with a layer or two of burlap and cover that with 6 
inches of soil.
 
 Make sure that the support posts are not in unnecessary contact with 
any soil and that the surrounding earth is graded to shed water away 
from the posts and retaining boards.
Once a year, clean the wall and post with soap and water, and apply a fresh 
coat of oil-based wood preservative (see the “Preservative” section, earlier in 
this chapter).

And Then There Was Rust
In This Chapter
▶ Preventing rust
▶ Removing rust
R
ust, the reddish-brown crust that forms on materials that contain iron, 
is caused by low-temperature oxidation in the presence of water. To 
maintain metal over very long periods of time, all you have to do is control 
rust. Fortunately, rust can be removed from metal year after year, layer after 
layer, without causing appreciable damage to the structural value of the 
metal. This is the main reason why metal is such a good buy in the long run.
Note that although rust can’t be prevented entirely, you sure can slow it 
down. In this chapter, we tell you how. We also tell you how to remove that 
layer of rust, should it appear.
Note: Even though this chapter refers to exterior maintenance, the problems 
and solutions apply to interior ornamental iron as well.
Shielding Your Metals with 
a Protective Coat
Barbecues, patio furniture, handrails, lawn and garden equipment, steel 
window frames, rain gutters, and downspouts are just a few of the many 
metal finishes around the home that are susceptible to damage by rust.
Aside from its ugly appearance, left untreated, rust can bring any of these fin-
ishes to an early demise and lead to other damage. A rain gutter with a rusted 
joint, for example, can leak and allow water to travel along the wood trim at 
the roofline, or, perhaps down the wood siding, ultimately resulting in rot, 
which might cost hundreds, or even thousands, of dollars to repair. Rust also 

348
Part V: Out in the Great Wide Open 
presents a safety issue. A rusted-out screw in a handrail or the rust-ravaged 
leg of a garden chair could send an unsuspecting guest flying to a nasty fall. 
Rusty outdoor power equipment leaves the operator particularly vulnerable 
because a rusted bolt could act as a projectile. Remember Superman and that 
speeding bullet? That could be you if you let rust have the upper hand.
Paint and oil are two types of coatings that you can rely on to shield a metal 
surface, and, therefore, prevent oxygen and water from doing their damage.
Choosing your primer and topcoat
Before you get down to painting, you need to know a few things about the 
primer and paint you choose.
A good paint job always begins with a high-quality primer. In this case, the 
primer should be made specifically for metal. Certain pigments contained 
in paint, such as zinc and iron oxide, adhere to metal much more effectively 
than other types. Ask the person at the paint store for primer and paint spe-
cifically designed for use with metal.
Whichever primer you decide to use, choose a topcoat that is compatible 
with the primer. In general, an oil-based finish coat is the most compatible 
with an oil-based primer. It also offers the greatest abrasion and weather 
resistance.
There are, of course, exceptions to the oil-based topcoat rule. For example, 
you should consider the architecture of gutters and downspouts. A flat-luster, 
acrylic, water-based topcoat produces a low sheen that tends to hide certain 
flaws, such as dents and joints. Plus, due to the inaccessibility of gutters and 
downspouts, more abrasion-resistant oil-based paint becomes unnecessary.
Grills, fireplaces, wood or coal stoves, heaters, and furnaces generate heat 
that exceeds 200 degrees. These fixtures should be topcoated with high-heat 
enamel paint specifically designed for use with items that are “too hot to 
touch.” (Note that most paints emit a harmless odor the first time they’re 
heated.)
Applying the paint
One coat each of a high-quality primer and a high-quality oil-based topcoat 
is all that should be required. You can apply the primer and topcoat using a 
brush, roller, paint pad, or sprayer.

349
 Chapter 19: And Then There Was Rust
 
When brushing an oil-based paint, use a natural-bristle brush. Synthetic 
brushes made from nylon or polyester work well with latex paints. However, 
they’re too stiff for use with oil-based paints, often causing brush marks — not 
to mention loose bristles — to remain in the finished product.
Spray painting using canned aerosol spray paint or a do-it-yourself spray rig 
poses several advantages. Spray-painting works well on intricate designs and 
is smoother (without brush marks). You need to take several precautions 
when spray-painting:
 
✓ Follow the necessary safety precautions. Be sure to wear eye protec-
tion and a respirator. And never spray-paint in an area where flames or 
sparks could ignite volatile vapors.
 
✓ Mask off surrounding areas with plastic, paper, or canvas to avoid 
damage by overspray. Don’t try spray-painting on a windy day unless, of 
course, your neighbor’s car needs a paint job. Just be sure she’s pleased 
with the color.
 
✓ If you’re using a spray rig, use a tip that’s compatible with the paint to 
avoid putting too much paint on at once. Tip sizes vary in accordance 
with the type of paint being used (oil based, water based, lacquer, and 
so on). Each type of paint has a different viscosity and, therefore, must 
be sprayed through a different size tip.
 
 Telling the various tips apart is really difficult. After you’ve purchased 
a tip for a specific use, if you plan to use it again, mark the tip with the 
type of paint it’s for — that way, you won’t have to rely on guesswork 
later.
 
✓ Avoid paint runs by applying several thin coats rather than one 
heavy one.
Protecting your metal with paint helps prevent rust as much as it can be 
prevented. However, as paint is chipped or scratched, and as it oxidizes 
with time and the elements, its effectiveness as a rust barrier diminishes. 
Eventually, moisture can make its way through the paint to the metal’s 
surface, and rust results. To extend the life of your paint job and your orna-
mental iron, touch up chipped and scratched areas immediately. We keep a 
container of touch-up paint in the garage for each color in our homes.
Stripping Off Rust
The real secret to dealing with rust is to remove as much of it as possible 
before trying to apply a new finish. (You can read about applying a new finish 

350
Part V: Out in the Great Wide Open 
in the preceding section.) Depending upon the configuration of the item in 
question, removing rust can be a tedious process that requires lots of elbow 
grease. In the end, your goal is to remove the rust down to bare metal. The 
following sections explain how.
Step 1: Removing rusted fasteners
When stripping a fixture of rust, you need to remove any rusted screws and 
fasteners — which is sometimes easier said than done because the rust can 
act as a bonding agent that can cause the fasteners and the metal structure 
to “freeze together” and become one.
Here are some ways you can remove rusted fasteners:
 
✓ Saturate the fastener with cutting oil. The cutting oil helps dissolve a 
small amount of the rust and acts as a lubricant to help free up some 
frozen connections. In combination with a screwdriver, pliers, or a 
wrench, cutting oil can be a favorable ally.
 
 Don’t count on using penetrating oil to remove rust. Penetrating oil breaks 
down a certain amount of rust, but it isn’t considered a good rust remover.
 
✓ Use heat to remove the fastener. A heat gun or propane torch causes a 
stubborn nut to expand and break loose from the bolt.
 
 If you plan to use heat to remove a fastener, be sure to first wipe off any 
lubricant or cutting oil you may have applied because the combination 
can cause a fire.
 
✓ Use a drill and a hacksaw. When all else fails, this usually does the trick.
Install rust-free replacements after you’ve eliminated the surrounding rust 
and refinished the object (see the next two sections). You can generally 
locate difficult-to-find replacement fasteners at machine shops. Either they’ll 
have the items in inventory or they’ll be able to fabricate a match.
 
There are different grades of nuts and bolts. Some are much stronger and, 
therefore, safer to use. Be sure to specify your use to the sales clerk to be sure 
that you get one that’s strong enough for the task at hand.
Step 2: Getting rid of the rust
The various methods (and tools) you can use to remove rust — sandpaper, 
flexible sanding sponges, solvents, and so on — fall into two general catego-
ries: those that rely on elbow grease and those that rely on chemical reac-
tions. The following sections have the details.

351
 Chapter 19: And Then There Was Rust
 
Whichever method you choose, be sure to wear protective gloves (to prevent 
metal splinters) and safety goggles (to prevent eye injuries caused by flying 
metal particles).
A little bit (or a lot) of elbow grease
Sandpaper, sanding tape, flexible sanding sponges, steel wool, and nylon 
scouring pads all work well and can be especially useful when working on 
tubing or twisted and curved material.
 
Sanding cord (industrial-strength dental floss) is a must when working around 
hard-to-access decorative elements, such as those you might find on a railing. 
As with sandpaper, sanding cord is available in a variety of grits.
A preference for plastic?
It’s an age-old decision: whether to purchase 
an item made of steel that is strong, solid, 
and durable or to use a lighter, less expensive 
material that may be easier to maintain (like 
aluminum or plastic). Think about it. Would you 
rather sit on a plastic patio chair or one made 
of steel?
Many products made of steel, when properly 
maintained, far outlast most other materials. 
The bad news is that, in the short run, prod-
ucts made of steel are more expensive than 
the alternatives. Remember: We said in the 
short term. Factoring together the initial cost, 
the maintenance cost, and how long an item 
ultimately lasts is the only way to accurately 
measure the overall cost of anything.
In some cases, you must use steel for its 
strength and longevity, despite the short-term 
cost. Remember that some of the oldest stand-
ing structures in the United States were built 
from steel and continue to stand tall and beauti-
ful after decades of existence. Can you imagine 
how long the Golden Gate Bridge would have 
lasted if it were made of wood? Would you want 
to chance a drive across it if it were made of 
plastic?
Some folks think that plastic is the solution to rust. 
We don’t. In our opinion, plastic is not the last-for-
ever wonder material that many believe it to be — 
despite the advice that Dustin Hoffman received 
in The Graduate. Plastic simply deteriorates dif-
ferently than steel. Although plastic doesn’t rust, 
it does give off free chlorides, which causes the 
plastic to become more and more brittle.
Rust is unsightly, constantly reminding you that 
metal is capable of deteriorating. With plastic, 
the process of becoming brittle isn’t so appar-
ent, but it does happen, and the deterioration 
that occurs is just as damaging. When plas-
tic becomes inflexible, it doesn’t spring back. 
Instead, it cracks. And unlike steel, “oxidized” 
plastic can’t be repaired.
Bottom line: Don’t be misled when people tell 
you that plastic won’t disintegrate. It will. And 
there isn’t anything that you can do to prevent 
it. Fortunately, plastic can be recycled, but so 
can steel.
By the way, we aren’t anti-plastic. We both have 
plastic and steel products in our homes. There’s 
just so much hype about plastic, we thought we 
would try to set the record straight.

352
Part V: Out in the Great Wide Open 
In those situations where there is more rust than elbow grease can handle, we 
recommend the addition of a little power. A wire brush or wire wheel attached 
to an electric drill can make simple work of stripping rust. A bit of fine finishing 
with sandpaper or steel wool helps remove any residue that may remain.
Using chemical removers
Some rust simply can’t be sanded or scraped without resulting in damage to 
the fixture. When dealing with this kind of rust, use a chemical rust remover 
or dissolver. These products contain ingredients that will chemically break 
down rust.
Rust-removal products containing gelled phosphoric acid, such as Naval Jelly, 
work best. You either brush the gel on (with a cheap paintbrush) or spray 
it on, and leave it there for 15 to 30 minutes for best results. Then simply 
rinse the chemical off with fresh water and dry it immediately. (Remember: 
Raw, wet steel begins to rust in minutes.) More than one application may be 
required, depending upon the severity of the rust.
 
Again, safety first. Be sure to wear rubber gloves and safety goggles, and 
have plenty of fresh ventilation when you’re working with chemical rust 
removers.
Step 3: Repairing damage to the surface
Badly pitted areas can be filled with a patching compound in the same 
manner that wood is repaired. The difference with metal is that the patching 
compound must be specifically made for use with metal. Metal expands and 
contracts at a much different rate than wood does. A metal patch, such as 
Bondo, is designed to expand and contract the same way that metal does. 
That’s why it’s more likely to stay in place after you apply it — that is, unless 
the metal patch is on your car, in which case it’s likely always on the move! 
You apply metal patch much like you apply spackle to wallboard when you’re 
filling a nail hole: Simply apply the metal patch using a putty knife, allow it to 
dry, and sand off the excess.
After you’ve removed the rust and repaired any surface damage, you’re ready 
to prime the metal. Do so within 24 hours to prevent the formation of new 
rust. (See the earlier section “Shielding Your Metals with a Protective Coat” 
for tips on priming and finishing a metal surface.)

353
 Chapter 19: And Then There Was Rust
When All Else Fails: Converting Rust
Although we recommend removing rust, there may be areas where this is 
simply impossible. If you can’t dissolve or scrape off rust, then you have 
another alternative: You can convert it. Come to think of it, there are several 
converts in our family . . . but that’s another story.
You apply rust converters directly over rust in the same way that you apply 
a coat of primer. The converter chemically combines with the rust, changing 
the rust to an inert byproduct. After the converter has cured (it doesn’t actu-
ally dry hard like paint, so industry types call the combining and drying pro-
cess curing), you can apply a fresh coat of paint directly over the converter.
One major disadvantage in using a converter in lieu of removing the rust is 
the likelihood of an uneven finish. The best way to guarantee a top-notch 
finish is to scrape, grind, patch, and sand the rust until it’s smooth.

Ten Cleaning Solutions 
You Can Make at Home

▶ Making your own all-purpose cleaners and mildew removers
▶ Mixing cleaning solutions for all types of surfaces
I
f you’ve ever heard us on the radio, then you know that we often delve 
deep into the Carey Brothers’ vault of valuable information to give listen-
ers many of our secret family formulas for various easy-to-make, non-caustic, 
homegrown cleaning solutions. Well, in this chapter, we share these formulas 
with you in one, easy-to-reference place.
All-Purpose, Handy-Dandy Cleaner
You can use our All-Purpose, Handy-Dandy Cleaner to clean and freshen just 
about any surface. It works especially well for day-to-day cleaning of range 
tops and cooktops. Just mix up the following ingredients:
 
✓ 1 teaspoon borax
 
✓ 1/2 teaspoon washing soda
 
✓ 2 teaspoons white vinegar
 
✓ 1/4 teaspoon dishwashing liquid
 
✓ 2 cups hot water
Washing soda is essentially turbo-charged baking soda. The technical name is 
sodium carbonate. Washing soda is a highly alkaline compound that makes a 
great all-purpose cleaning product and is often used as an additive to laundry 
detergent and other cleaning products to produce superior results.

358
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
You can replace the washing soda with baking soda and use lemon juice 
instead of white vinegar, depending upon what you have lying around the 
house. Just keep in mind that washing soda and lemon juice are a bit stronger 
than baking soda and white vinegar.
 
The secret to most cleaning formulas is hot water. It helps the various ingredi-
ents blend.
DIY Cleanser Scrub
Our formula for DIY Cleanser Scrub is especially suited for cleaning up baked-
on spills on glass or porcelain ranges and cooktops when you would normally 
pull out the cleanser. Start with the following ingredients:
 
✓ 3/4 cup borax
 
✓ 1/4 cup baking soda
 
✓ Dishwashing liquid to moisten
Combine the two powders and moisten them with just enough dishwash-
ing liquid to create a gooey paste. You can use all borax or all baking soda if 
you want, depending upon what you have around the house, but just keep in 
mind that the concoction won’t be quite as strong without the borax. For a 
more pleasing and lingering aroma, add 1/4 teaspoon lemon juice.
Gentle Glass Cleaner
Our Gentle Glass Cleaner works well for cleaning the glass shelving in your 
refrigerator, glass cooktops, and the windows in range and oven doors. You 
need the following ingredients:
 
✓ 2 tablespoons ammonia
 
✓ 1/4 teaspoon dishwashing liquid
 
✓ 1/2 cup rubbing alcohol
 
✓ Hot water
Mix the ammonia, dishwashing liquid, and rubbing alcohol, and add enough 
hot water to make 1 quart of cleaner. If you prefer, you can avoid the smell of 
ammonia by using white vinegar or lemon juice. However, these optional con-
coctions will cause the formula to be slightly less powerful.

359
 Chapter 20: Ten Cleaning Solutions You Can Make at Home
 
For super-duper window cleaning — especially in cold weather when windows 
are extra dirty — add 1 teaspoon of cornstarch to the formula to boost your 
cleaning-and-sparkling horsepower.
People-Friendly Oven Cleaner
Our People-Friendly Oven Cleaner is a safe alternative to those conventional, 
caustic oven cleaners. You can also use it to clean barbecue grills and grungy 
pots and pans. Start with the following ingredients:
 
✓ 2 teaspoons borax or baking soda
 
✓ 2 tablespoons dishwashing liquid
 
✓ 11/4 cups ammonia
 
✓ 11/2 cups hot water
Mix the ingredients, apply generously to spills, and let the solution soak for 
30 minutes or as long as overnight. Loosen tough spills with a nylon scrub-
ber, and then wipe up with a damp sponge.
Super-Duper Disinfectant Cleaner
Our Super-Duper Disinfectant Cleaner works well anywhere you would use 
a store-bought disinfectant, such as on appliance pulls and handles, the 
inside face of the refrigerator where the gasket seats, the refrigerator drip 
pan, counters and cutting boards, and around the opening of your clothes 
washer. It works especially well on all surfaces of a trash compactor — inside 
and out.
Mix the following ingredients and then scrub:
 
✓ 1 tablespoon borax or baking soda
 
✓ 1/4 cup powdered laundry detergent
 
✓ 1/4 cup pine-oil-based cleaner or pine oil
 
✓ 3/4 cup hot water
For kitchen countertops, backsplashes, and the like (where there is a lot of 
area to cover), you can dilute with more hot water to get more coverage.

360
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Super Wood Cleaner
To give fine wood cabinets (or furniture) a super cleaning, mix up our Super 
Wood Cleaner. Start with the following ingredients:
 
✓ 3 tablespoons turpentine
 
✓ 3 tablespoons boiled linseed oil
 
✓ 1 quart boiling water
 
This formula is not made for painted surfaces.
To create the cleaner, heat a quart of water in a saucepan and, as soon as it 
boils, pour the water into any old container. Then add the turpentine and 
the linseed oil to the water and stir vigorously. Immediately immerse a clean 
white cloth in the mixture and tightly wring it out. (Be sure you’re wearing 
gloves when you do this!) Clean small areas at a time (no more than about 2 
square feet), and use a clean, dry, terry-cloth towel to immediately dry the 
freshly cleaned area.
 
This mixture is moderately flammable, so no smoking or open flames while 
you’re working. For the same reason, don’t try to reheat the mixture — mix up 
a new batch when it gets cold. Dispose of the leftover liquid by letting it evap-
orate outside; don’t pour it down the drain. Even the rags can be flammable — 
let them completely air-dry outside before disposing of them in the trash. 
Don’t keep the rags inside — they’re subject to spontaneous combustion!
Soda-Pop Concrete Stain Remover
Use our Soda-Pop Concrete Stain Remover on all concrete where the surface 
looks like an Indy 500 pit stop. You need the following ingredients:
 
✓ A small bag of cat litter
 
✓ A few cans of cola beverage (diet or regular)
 
✓ 1 cup liquid chlorine bleach
 
✓ 1 cup powdered laundry detergent
 
✓ 1 gallon hot water
Completely cover the grease or oil stain with a thin layer of the cat litter and 
grind it in with your shoes. When the mess is completely absorbed, sweep 

361
 Chapter 20: Ten Cleaning Solutions You Can Make at Home
up and discard the cat litter. Cover the stain that’s left with the cola beverage 
and use a bristle brush to work the liquid into the affected area for about 15 
to 20 minutes or until the cola stops fizzing. Don’t let the area dry out — use 
fresh water to rinse away the cola. A gray stain will be left. Add the detergent 
and bleach to the hot water, and scrub away the gray stain.
 
Although this solution is mild, be sure to wear gloves and eye protection when 
you work with it.
Easy All-Surface Mildew Remover
Our Easy All-Surface Mildew Remover works great on painted or other wash-
able surfaces and costs about one-fifth the price of its store-bought equiva-
lent. Start with the following ingredients:
 
✓ 1/3 cup powdered, ammonia-free laundry detergent
 
✓ 1 quart liquid chlorine bleach
 
✓ 3 quarts warm water
 
Make sure the detergent you use is ammonia free. Mixing bleach with a solu-
tion containing ammonia can release a dangerous gas that’s harmful to your 
lungs.
Pour the water in a bucket. Add the bleach to the water, and then add the 
detergent. While wearing rubber gloves, stir the concoction until the deter-
gent fully blends into the solution. Pour some of the mildew remover into a 
spray bottle. Spray the remover onto any area where mildew exists and allow 
it to sit for five to ten minutes, but don’t let it dry. You’ll know that the solu-
tion is working when the black mildew stains turn white. Rinse all the sur-
faces very well with hot water and towel-dry.
 
When you’re working with this mildew remover, wear gloves and eye protec-
tion and make sure you have plenty of ventilation.
Special Drain Freshener and Cleaner
Our foamy Special Drain Freshener and Cleaner is great for bathroom and 
kitchen drains. Although it isn’t meant to free badly clogged drains, it can 
freshen them and prevent clogging. Use this formula once a month for best 
results. Here’s what you need:

362
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ 1 cup baking soda
 
✓ 1 cup table salt
 
✓ 1 cup white vinegar
 
✓ 2 quarts boiling water
First, pour the baking soda into the drain, followed by the salt, and then the 
vinegar. The mixture will begin to foam. After a few minutes, pour the water 
into the drain. Let it stand overnight before using the faucet again.
 
Be sure to add the ingredients in the recommended order. Adding the vinegar 
first followed by the salt and baking soda can actually create a clog.
Universal Roof-Cleaning Formula
Use our Universal Roof-Cleaning Formula when your roof gets dirty. The 
concoction also gets rid of mildew or moss on your roof. You need these 
ingredients:
 
✓ 1 cup liquid chlorine bleach
 
✓ 1 cup powdered laundry detergent
 
✓ 1 gallon hot water
Add the bleach to the water and then add the detergent. Mix the ingredients 
until the soap granules dissolve. Pour the mixture into a garden sprayer. 
Apply the liquid onto the affected area, and keep it wet for at least 15 min-
utes. Use a broom to scrub the surface. Rinse with a garden hose.
 
A pressure washer works best. Just be careful not to damage the roof with the 
force of the spray. Hold the spray tip back about 12 to 18 inches from the roof.

Ten Maintenance Skills You Need
In This Chapter
▶ Mastering basic home-maintenance skills
▶ Improving and prolonging your home’s proper operation
▶ Increasing efficiency and avoiding problems
C
aulking lubricating, testing, painting, and more are common mainte-
nance tasks that you’ll eventually perform as a homeowner. In this chap-
ter, we list ten universal maintenance tasks and share a few basics that we 
hope will help you accomplish each task as quickly and as easily as possible 
without sacrificing safety.
Caulking
Caulk is the stuff you pump into a gap to make it airtight or watertight. Sounds 
easy enough — and it is once you get the hang of it. To caulk, all you have to 
do is make sure that the area to be caulked is clean and dry. Open the caulk, 
squeeze a bead into the gap or crack, wipe off the excess, and smooth the seam 
with a plastic putty knife or a credit card — we use our fingers. You can clean off 
the excess with water or the solvent recommended for the caulk being used.
 
There are a million different types and colors of caulk, and knowing which to 
choose is important. Here are the three most common types in order of our 
personal preference:
 
✓ Polyurethane: This is our favorite all-purpose sealant and adhesive. It’s 
flexible, paintable, and super long lasting.
 
✓ Silicone: This is an excellent all-purpose sealant and adhesive. It’s flex-
ible and super long lasting. Some silicone caulks are paintable.
 
✓ Latex: Latex caulk is a good all-purpose sealant and adhesive for little 
projects where water protection isn’t an issue. You can paint it, but it’s 
brittle and shrinks and cracks easily.

364
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
Regardless of which type of caulking you select, make sure that the surface 
you’re applying it to is clean and dry — even if the caulk label claims it can be 
applied to wet surfaces.
Knowing How (And What) to Lubricate
A little lubrication can go a long way toward helping parts move more easily. 
Lubrication reduces stress on motors and equipment, which reduces operat-
ing cost and extends life. Here are common lubricants and what they can be 
used to lubricate:
 
✓ Spray grease: Good for things like the rollers, gears, or the chain on 
your garage door. Simply point and spray.
 
✓ Machine oil: Good for bearings, like you’d find in older furnaces. To 
apply machine oil, find the lubrication port, open it, and add a few 
drops.
 
✓ Silicone lubricant: This type of lubricant is good for sliding doors, slid-
ing windows, and sliding screens, because it doesn’t gum up. To apply 
silicone lubricant, clean the track and then point and spray.
 
✓ Graphite: Use graphite to lubricate door hardware and locks (can you 
spell “I don’t want a broken key?”). To use graphite lubricant, place the 
tip of the container against the key hole and squeeze.
 
Anything in your home that contains a moving part is a candidate for sched-
uled lubrication. If you aren’t sure, contact the seller or manufacturer and find 
out. The equipment you save will be your own!
Recognizing and Testing for Problems
You know that a smoke detector or carbon-monoxide detector with worn-out 
batteries provides absolutely no protection in the event of a fire. But did you 
also know that a water heater can explode if the pressure and temperature 
relief valve is stuck closed and that the explosion has the force of a stick of 
dynamite?
Fire extinguishers can leak and lose their charge rendering them useless in an 
emergency. When was the last time you took a peek at your fire extinguishers. 
Do you even remember where they are?

365
 Chapter 21: Ten Maintenance Skills You Need
 
Twice a year, locate your fire extinguishers and read the pressure gauge. Once 
a year, pull the pin and give each extinguisher a quick test blast. Every three 
years, replace your extinguishers.
You can check these and other household devices easily and safely. Smoke 
detectors, water-heater pressure and temperature-relief valves, carbon-
monoxide detectors, and fire extinguishers are examples of devices you’ll 
find in our home-maintenance plan in Chapter 3. Many household devices are 
designed to be tested, so if something has a Test button, use it!
 
Not checking and testing a safety device places you and your family in grave 
danger.
Choosing the Right Tool for the Job
Nothing is more difficult than attempting a home-repair project without the 
proper tools. Can you spell “busted knuckles”? Not only is it important to 
have the right tool for the job, but that tool must be in good condition as 
well. A dull chisel, for example, can do more damage than good. A dull saw 
or the wrong saw for the job can break your back. (Did you know that there 
is a wrench made especially for reaching up behind the kitchen sink? Yep, it’s 
called a sink wrench.)
So when you’re tackling a job yourself, make sure you have the proper tools. 
Start by researching the project. Throughout this book, we tell you which 
tool you’ll need for the job at hand. When you know which tools are needed, 
you can research what each does. A handy neighbor or a knowledgeable 
hardware-store clerk also can be helpful.
What if you don’t have or can’t get the proper tool? Well, some projects are 
best left to contractors, especially when investing in the proper tool(s) costs 
more than a professional repair.
 
Be cautious of bargain tools. A tool that breaks in your hand can hurt.
Testing an Electrical Circuit
It goes without saying that an electrical death is shocking. With an electrical 
circuit, it’s important to ensure that your ground fault circuit interrupters 

366
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
(GFCIs) are operating properly. To check, simply press the Test button to be 
sure that the circuit is safe. (See the earlier section “Recognizing and Testing 
for Problems” for info on other devices you can test.)
Make sure you know which plug or light belongs to which fuse or breaker. 
At any hardware store or home center, you can buy a simple circuit locator 
device that allows you to do this test quickly and conveniently. Then, in the 
event of a smoky circuit, you can turn off the breaker and prevent a fire with-
out having to shut down the whole house.
Painting
Painting provides a protective coating to a surface, preventing rot and deteri-
oration and making for easy cleaning. Doing it right and doing it well couldn’t 
be more important. Outside, the ultraviolet rays of the sun and water from 
rain, snow, and irrigation can destroy the home’s exterior. A solid coat of 
paint looks good, but more important, it’s a barrier between your home and 
Mother Nature. Interior painting is equally important to protect your home 
against everyday wear and tear. If walls and trim are beyond cleaning, it’s 
time to paint.
Painting well requires two basic steps:
 
1. Prepare the surface.
 
 Preparation (sanding, caulking, and cleaning) constitutes 80 percent of a 
paint job, and it’s key to a good final finish.
 
2. Paint.
 
 Use the best paint money can buy. The longer the paint lasts, the less 
often you’ll find yourself with a paintbrush in hand. Test paint by rub-
bing your thumb and index fingers together in the paint. If it’s smooth 
and silky, it’s good paint. If it fells gritty, buy something else.
If you want more information on painting, check out Painting Do-It-Yourself For 
Dummies, by Katharine Kaye McMillan, PhD, and Patricia Hart McMillan (Wiley).
Knowing How to Shut Things Off
When we covered the Loma Prieta earthquake in San Francisco two decades 
ago, we discovered that much of the danger to life and limb did not result 

367
 Chapter 21: Ten Maintenance Skills You Need
from the earthquake. Instead, broken water and gas lines exposed residents 
to costly floods and deadly fires. Folks didn’t know how to shut down these 
services — or even that shutting them down was important.
Here’s how to shut down the major lines coming into your home:
 
✓ Water: Depending on where you live, you either have a water meter 
valve or a main shut-off valve. Water meters and main shut-off valves 
are generally located somewhere near the edge of your property. 
Additionally, you should have a water shut-off valve at your home. In 
most cases the easiest valve to shut off is the round faucet handle at 
your house. However, this can take almost a minute.
 
 You may want to replace your old-style round faucet handle with a 
quarter-turn ball valve. In less than a second, you can have the water 
completely off and be on your way to safety.
 
✓ Electricity: Every home typically has one breaker (the main breaker) 
that shuts off all the electricity. You need to know where the main 
breaker (or fuse) is and how to shut the breaker off.
 
 Never shut off a breaker when you’re standing in a puddle of water.
 
✓ Gas: Find out where the gas meter is on your property and what size 
wrench is necessary to turn it off. Most hardware stores carry the type 
of wrench needed for the gas meters in your neck of the woods. We sug-
gest purchasing such a tool and tying it to the gas meter, so you won’t 
have to go looking for it if and when an emergency arises. (Note: Modern 
gas-meter installations include an automatic earthquake shut-off valve.)
 
Make sure every member of your household knows where all these items are 
located and how to turn them off. When in doubt, turn everything off. Some 
systems may by slightly difficult to turn on later, but it doesn’t ever hurt your 
home to turn everything off in an emergency.
Venting Moisture from Your Home
Damp air, condensation, and steam are nothing more than various forms of 
house-damaging water. Metal rusts, mildew thrives, wallpaper peels, and 
paint bubbles when any form of moisture attacks. That’s why it’s important 
to have ample ventilation.
Start with a good bath fan and a more powerful range hood. And don’t forget 
to ensure that there is an exhaust fan in the laundry. Wherever steam is gen-
erated in your home, there should be an exhaust fan to properly remove it.

368
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
A decorative paddle fan is another important tool. Moisture often occurs in 
the form of condensation on windows and walls — you know “sweaty win-
dows” and “sweaty walls.” A ceiling-mounted decorative paddle fan run in 
reverse forces air up to the ceiling and then down the walls, absorbing mois-
ture and preventing all forms of mildew, rot, and rust from growing on what 
would otherwise be a feeding ground for the fungus among us.
Replacing Filters and Cleaning Sensors
Filters and sensors exist everywhere in your home. If we asked you to name 
a filter, you’d probably say “furnace filter.” And you’d be right — the furnace 
filter is one of the most important of the bunch. But there are more.
Here’s our list of the most common filters and sensors and how often to clean 
or replace them:
 
✓ Furnace filter: Change monthly. Pleated filters are the best.
 
 To test the quality of a filter, hold the filter horizontally (like a platter) 
and pour regular table salt onto it. If the salt passes through, replace 
the filter.
 
✓ Range-hood filter: Clean every couple of months deepening on how 
often you cook and how much frying you do. (More frying equals more 
frequent cleaning, because grease can build up and clog the filter.)
 
✓ Bath or laundry exhaust fan: Clean every six months. (We know, the 
grate that covers the fan is not a filter per se, but a dirty cover can still 
wreak havoc with the system.)
 
✓ Refrigerator filter: Replace in accordance with the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Besides, who wants dirty ice?
 
✓ Smoke-detector sensor: Vacuum twice a year. Open the unit and use 
your vacuum cleaner hose with a soft brush attachment. You may also 
use compressed air — like the kind you use to clean your computer 
keyboard.
 
✓ Whole-house filters: Change at least once a year. You may find that your 
water tastes better if you change the filter every six months. Filters trap 
debris and bacteria that can eventually affect the taste of water that 
passes through it.
 
✓ Dryer filter: Clean it every time you use the dryer, and clean the cham-
ber that holds the filter at least once a quarter. A long skinny nozzle on 
the end of your vacuum cleaner hose is all it takes.

Checking On the Chimney
Nothing is as romantic as a crackling fire. And nothing can level your house 
faster than the explosion and raging fire from a creosote-laden chimney. Save 
the fireworks for the fairgrounds on the Fourth of July. Call a chimney sweep 
to thoroughly clean your chimney at least once a year or after every cord of 
burned wood.
Here are some chimney-related maintenance tasks you can do yourself:
 
✓ Make sure the damper is in proper working order by ensuring that it 
opens and closes easily.
 
✓ Keep birds’ nests and other debris from blocking the spark arrestor atop 
your chimney.
 
✓ If you notice cracks in the mortar or brick, don’t use your fireplace until 
the cracks are repaired — that is, unless you like loud explosions.
