Dedication
I would like to thank my father (MHK), my mother (SYT), and the rest of the 
Kao family for everything they’ve done for me. I wouldn’t be here without 
their kindness and understanding. I would also like to thank my lovely wife, 
Marie-Claude, and little Jade for all their support. In addition, thanks to 
Manon Lalancette and the rest of Gamelin family for all your cheers!
—Robert Kao
To Yosma, Dean, and Drew: My greatest treasures. Thank you for your 
thoughts, understanding, and support.
—Dante Sarigumba
A few thank-yous are in order here. First, to Rob and Dante, for giving me 
the opportunity to work on this title with them. To Marcus, Diana, Dieter, 
Joel, Andrew, and the entire Smartphone Experts team, for being the abso-
lute best at everything they do. Thanks also goes to Erika, for putting up 
with my obsessive CrackBerrying. Lastly, I need to give props to my mother, 
who at 60 years old recently got her fi rst cell phone, a BlackBerry Bold, read 
BlackBerry Bold For Dummies, and now BBMs me on it daily.
—Kevin Michaluk

Introduction
H
i there, and welcome to BlackBerry Storm For Dummies, 2nd Edition. 
This book is intended to cover most of what you need to know about 
the BlackBerry Storm and the BlackBerry Storm2 smart phones. Throughout 
the book, we’re going to use the Storm to describe both smart phones but 
will point out differences along the way. If you already have a Storm, this 
is a great book to have around when you want to discover new features or 
need something to slap open and use as a quick reference. If you don’t have 
a Storm yet and have some basic questions (such as “What is a BlackBerry 
Storm?” or “How can a BlackBerry Storm help me be more productive?”), you 
can benefit by reading this book cover to cover. No matter what your current 
BlackBerry user status — BUS, for short — we’re here to help you get the 
most out of your BlackBerry Storm.
Right off the bat, we can tell you that a BlackBerry Storm isn’t a fruit you find 
at the supermarket, nor is it related to nasty weather patterns. Rather, it’s 
an always-connected smart phone that has e-mail capabilities and a built-in 
Internet browser. With your BlackBerry Storm, you’re in the privileged posi­
tion of always being able to receive e-mail, message your friends, and browse 
the Web.
On top of that, a BlackBerry Storm has all the features you expect from a per­
sonal organizer, including a calendar, to-do lists, and memos. Oh, and did we 
mention that a BlackBerry Storm has a built-in mobile phone? Talk about mul­
titasking! Imagine you are stuck on a commuter train. With your BlackBerry 
Storm by your side, you can compose e-mail while conducting a conference 
call — all from the comfort of your seat.
That’s not all. BlackBerry Storm goes a step further to make it more fun for 
you to own this device. You can snap a picture with its camera, listen to your 
music collection, record a funny video, and enjoy watching that video on 
YouTube.
In this book, we show you all the basics and then go the extra mile by high­
lighting some of the lesser-known (but still handy) features of the BlackBerry 
Storm. Your Storm can work hard for you when you need it to and can play 
hard when you want it to.
And finally, you’ll be happy to know that we acquired the help of a well-
known BlackBerry enthusiast and co-founder of CrackBerry.com, Kevin 
Michulak, to provide you with insights and helpful tips scattered throughout 
the book.

About This Book
BlackBerry Storm For Dummies is a comprehensive user guide as well as a 
quick user reference. This book is designed so that you can read it cover to 
cover if you want, but you don’t need to read one chapter after the other. 
Feel free to jump around in the book while you explore the different function­
alities of your BlackBerry Storm.
We cover basic and advanced topics, but we stick to those that we consider 
the most practical and frequently used. If you use or want to use a certain 
function of your BlackBerry Storm, we likely cover it here.
Who Are You?
In this book, we tried to be considerate of your needs, but because we’ve 
never met you, our image of you is as follows. If you find that some of these 
images are true about you, this might just be the book for you:
	
✓	You have a BlackBerry Storm and want to find out how to get the most 
from it.
	
✓	You don’t have a BlackBerry Storm yet, and you’re wondering what one 
could do for you.
	
✓	You’re looking for a book that doesn’t assume that you know all the 
jargon and tech terms used in the smart phone and PDA industry. (PDA 
stands for personal digital assistant, by the way. Take that, you jargon, 
you!)
	
✓	You want a reference that shows you, step by step, how to do useful 
and cool things with a BlackBerry Storm without bogging you down with 
unnecessary background or theory.
	
✓	You’re tired of hauling your ten-pound laptop with you on trips, and 
you’re wondering how to turn your BlackBerry Storm into a miniature 
traveling office.
	
✓	You no longer want to be tied to your desktop system for the critical 
activities in your life, such as sending and receiving e-mail, checking 
your calendar for appointments, and surfing the Web.
	
✓	You like to have some fun, play games, and be entertained from a device 
but don’t want to carry an extra game gadget.

 Introduction
What’s in This Book
BlackBerry Storm For Dummies consists of five parts, and each part consists 
of different chapters related to that part’s theme.
Part I: Meet and Greet Your 
BlackBerry Storm
Part I starts with the basics of your Storm. You know: what it is, what you can 
do with it, and what elements make it up with. We describe how you navigate 
using the innovative touch screen that behaves like multiple buttons and the 
difference between the QWERTY and SureType keyboard layouts. We also 
show you how to personalize and express yourself through your BlackBerry 
Storm. This part wraps up with must-knows about security.
Part II: Getting Organized and 
Online with Your Storm
Part II deals with the fact that your BlackBerry Storm is also a full-fledged 
PDA. We show you how to keep your contacts in Contacts as well as how to 
manage appointments and meetings in Calendar. You also find out how to 
use the Clock application to set an alarm, use as a timer, and set your device 
to Bedside mode. You explore the Password Keeper application to centralize 
your passwords. As you’ll see, most BlackBerry applications interconnect, 
working hard for you.
Part II also shows you what made BlackBerry what it is today: always-con­
nected e-mail. We get into the other strengths of the BlackBerry — Web surf­
ing functionality — but it doesn’t stop there. We point out how you can use 
other forms of messages such as text messaging, instant messaging, PIN-to-
PIN messages, and BlackBerry Messenger.
Part III: Going Multimedia 
with Your Storm
You find the fun stuff in Part III. Rock your world and use your Storm to play 
music, watch videos, and take pictures. You also get the scoop on how to 

4
BlackBerry Storm For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
record videos and sample ring tones. Plus you get timesaving shortcuts on 
the Media applications. And rest assured that your BlackBerry will be a good 
companion when you’re traveling because we also show you how to use its 
GPS. Last, Part III describes the phone part of Storm and money-saving tips; it 
is a smart phone after all.
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager
In Part IV, we detail BlackBerry Desktop Manager and show you some of the 
hoops you can put it through with your BlackBerry Storm, including making 
backups and installing BlackBerry applications from your PC to your Storm. 
You also find out how to port data from your older devices — BlackBerry or 
not — to your new Storm. And we didn’t forget to cover important topics, 
such as data-syncing your appointments and contacts with desktop applica­
tions such as Outlook. And finally, you’ll find all the possible ways you can 
install third-party applications.
Part V: The Part of Tens
All For Dummies books include The Part of Tens, and this book is no differ­
ent. In Part V, we show you where to get cool BlackBerry Storm accessories, 
find useful mobile Web sites, and get great applications and games to play on 
your BlackBerry Storm. In addition, we keep this list up-to-date on our Web 
site at www.blackberryfordummies.com.

In this part . . .
T
he road to a happy and collaborative relationship 
with your BlackBerry Storm starts here. Chapter 1 
covers all the nuts and bolts: how the Storm works, its 
look and feel, and connectivity. Chapter 2 describes how 
you navigate with the virtual keys. Chapter 3 discusses 
customizing your BlackBerry and also how to take care of 
your device.

Chapter 1
Your BlackBerry Is Not

In This Chapter
▶	Checking out your BlackBerry behind the scenes
▶	Seeing what your BlackBerry can do
▶	Saving power and feeling secure
B
ecause you’re reading this book, you probably have a BlackBerry Storm 
(and we’re pretty sure that you’re not eating it). We’re just curious, 
though — what convinced you to buy this particular smart phone? Was it the 
touch screen? Was it the always-connected e-mail? The multimedia player to 
replace your iPod or iPhone? Or was it the really good sales pitch? We know; 
the list could go on and on — and we might never hit on the exact reason you 
got yours. For whatever reason you got your BlackBerry, congratulations; 
you made an intelligent choice.
The same smarts that made you buy your BlackBerry Storm are clearly at it 
again. This time, your intelligence led you to pick up this book, perhaps because 
your intuition told you there’s more to your BlackBerry Storm than meets the eye.
Your hunch is right. Your Storm can help you do more than you supposed. 
For example, your BlackBerry is a whiz at making phone calls, but it’s also a 
computer that can check your e-mail and surf the Web. We’re talking World 
Wide Web here, so the sky’s the limit. Help is always at your fingertips rather 
than sitting on some desk at home or at the office:
	
✓	Need to check out the reviews of that restaurant on the corner?
	
✓	Need to know — right now — what’s showing in your local movie the­
aters, or what’s coming in the weather tonight, or what’s the best place 
to shop the sales?
	
✓	Need to know your current location and get directions to that cozy bed-
and-breakfast, or retrieve news headlines, or check stock quotes?
	
✓	Want to do some online chatting or view some pictures online?
	
✓	Hanker to network with your old classmates?

10
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry Storm 
You can do all these things (and more) by using your BlackBerry Storm.
	
Storm is also a full-fledged personal digital assistant (PDA). Out of the box, 
it provides you with the organizational tools you need to set up to-do lists, 
manage your appointments, take care of your address books, and more.
Being armed with a device that’s a phone, an Internet connection, a PDA, and 
a full-on media player all built into one makes you a powerful person. With 
your Storm (along with this resourceful book), you really can increase your 
productivity and become better organized. Watch out, world! BlackBerry 
Storm–wielding powerhouse coming through!
If you stick with us, you will find out all you need to get the most out of your 
device or maybe even save a troubled relationship. (Well, the last one is a bit 
of an exaggeration, but we got your attention, right?)
How It All Works: The 
Schematic Approach
For those who always ask, “How do they do that?” you don’t have to go far; 
this little section is just for you.
The role of the network service provider
Along with wondering how your BlackBerry Storm works, you might be 
wondering why you had to get your Storm through a network service pro­
vider such as Verizon or Telus rather than directly from RIM (Research In 
Motion). Why did you need to go through a middleman? After all, RIM makes 
BlackBerry Storm.
That’s an excellent question — and here’s the quick-and-dirty answer. RIM 
needs a delivery system — a communication medium, as it were — for its tech­
nology to work. Not in a position to come up with such a delivery system all by 
its lonesome, RIM partnered (and built alliances across the globe) with what 
developed into its network service providers — the usual suspects (meaning 
the big cellphone companies). These middlemen support the wireless network 
for your BlackBerry Storm so you can connect to the BlackBerry Internet 
service — and get all those wonderful e-mails (and spend so much valuable 
time surfing the Internet). See Figure 1-1 for an overview of this process.

Know your BlackBerry history
Your BlackBerry Storm is truly wondrous, 
boasting many features beyond your ordinary 
mobile phone. And its “sudden” popularity 
didn’t happen overnight. Like any other good 
product, BlackBerry Storm has come a long 
way from its (relatively humble) beginnings.
In the days when the Palm Pilot ruled the PDA 
world, Research In Motion (RIM, the maker of 
the BlackBerry) was busy in its lab, ignoring the 
then-popular graffiti input method and design­
ing a device with a QWERTY keyboard — the 
kind of keyboard people were used to from 
working on their computers. RIM didn’t stop 
there, however. It added an always-connected 
e-mail capability, making this device a must-
have among government officials as well as 
finance and health professionals.
To meet the needs of government officials 
and industry professionals, RIM made reliabil­
ity, security, and durability the priorities when 
manufacturing its devices. Today, BlackBerry 
Storm comes from the same line of RIM family 
products, inheriting all the good genes while 
boosting usability and adding more functions 
to its core BlackBerry applications. As a result, 
BlackBerry is popular among not only prosum­
ers (professional customers), but also con­
sumers. Starting with BlackBerry Pearl, RIM 
has been targeting the mainstream consumer 
market. Clearly, with BlackBerry Storm, RIM is 
winning the hearts of consumers while main­
taining its hold on the enterprise market.

12
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry Storm 
Network service providers don’t build alliances for nothing, right? In return, 
RIM gave them the right to brand their names on the BlackBerry they offer 
for sale. For example, a Verizon BlackBerry Storm looks different from a simi­
lar model you get from TELUS Canada.
	
Do BlackBerry functionalities differ from phone model to phone model? Quick 
answer: With the core BlackBerry applications (such as Tasks and Contracts), 
you find no major differences. Other features, such as Instant Messaging, 
might or might not be supported by the network service provider.
Just to keep the scorecard straight, when we talk about features available from 
one network service provider that aren’t available from others, we point that out.
Connecting to your computer
Nowadays, a personal laptop or net book is a household necessity. People 
spend so much time on them, and so much information is stored in them. No 
surprise that BlackBerry works hand-in-hand with your PC. The USB cable 
that comes with your BlackBerry does more than just charge your device.
Part IV helps you use your PC connection with the help of BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager and all the utilities that come with it. In Chapter 15, you 
find how to sync your device with the Personal Information Manager data 
that you keep in your PC. You can also read Chapter 16 for directions for 
switching from another device (even a non-BlackBerry device) to a new 
BlackBerry. For example, you find out how to import your contacts list into 
your new BlackBerry. Chapter 17 tells you how to protect your data.
	
If you have a Mac instead of a PC, there is now BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
for Mac. Check out Chapter 15 for more.
Oh, the Things You Can Do!
In the BlackBerry world, it used to be that always-connected e-mail was the 
primary factor that made BlackBerry attractive and is likely first in the long 
list of reasons you got yours.
With Storm you get that, but the touch screen is the center of all attention these 
days. The touch screen on Storm is a work of art (and science) and a beautiful 
part of the device. Just hop off your flight, turn on your BlackBerry, and voila: 
You can receive and send e-mails whether you’re in Hong Kong, London, or 
Paris. Your significant other can get in touch with you wherever you are — just 
to say hi or to remind you that you promised Aunt Edna a case of Chanel No. 5.
Although e-mail is BlackBerry’s strength, it’s not the only major benefit of the 
device, as you find out in this section.

13
 Chapter 1: Your BlackBerry Is Not an Edible Fruit
All-in-one multimedia center
Previously, many people hesitated to buy a BlackBerry due to the lack of mul­
timedia functions. They wanted a camera and audio and full video playback. 
BlackBerry Storm has changed all that and has more features than you may 
expect. Not only does Storm have a high-resolution camera — 3.2 megapixels, 
to be exact — but it also has a memory slot for a microSD card (see Chapter 2). 
What does that mean? Well, it means your BlackBerry can function as the 
following:
	
✓	A music and video player that support all the common file formats
	
✓	A portable flash drive
	
✓	Your personal photo collection
On top of all that, Storm offers a touch-screen virtual QWERTY keyboard.
Internet at your fingertips
Yup, with the new BlackBerry Web browser on Storm, you can surf the 
Net nearly as smoothly as you do on a desktop computer. Even better, 
you can continue chatting with your friends through Instant Messenger, 
just as though you never left your office. You’ll get an alert when your 
stock is tanking. True, that isn’t fun, but you want this information as fast 
as possible.
Intrigued? Read how Storm can take full advantage of the Web in Chapter 10.
Me and my great personal assistant
You might be saying, “But I’m really a busy person, and I don’t have time to 
browse the Web. What I do need is an assistant to help me better organize 
my day-to-day tasks.” If you can afford a personal assistant, by all means go 
ahead and hire one. The next best thing is a personal digital assistant (PDA). 
Just as people come in many flavors, so do many PDAs.
Whip out that BlackBerry of yours and take a closer look. That’s right, your 
BlackBerry is also a full-fledged PDA, helping you be more productive and 
much more:
	
✓	Remember all your acquaintances (see Chapter 4)
	
✓	Manage your appointments (Chapter 5)
	
✓	Set alarms and keep your passwords (Chapter 6)

14
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry Storm 
A touch-screen PC in the 
palm of your hand
Touch screen? Check.
Remarkable communication device? Check.
Full-fledged PDA? Check.
These capabilities are just the tip of the iceberg. Don’t underestimate the 
device because of its size: Your Storm is also a powerful computer.
Need convincing? Here goes. Out of the box, with no fiddling, it comes with 
a great set of organizational and productivity tools in the form of programs. 
Software developers outside RIM are taking advantage of this growing market — 
which means hundreds of applications are available. For example, you can 
download graphics-intensive games or a mortgage calculator.
Download? Absolutely! BlackBerry Storm comes with BlackBerry App World, 
which lets you download applications OTA, or over the air. See Chapter 18 for 
more
Look, Dad, no hands!
Your Storm is equipped with an earphone that doubles as a mic for hands-
free talking. This accessory is your doctor’s prescription for preventing the 
stiff neck that comes from wedging your Storm between your ear and your 
shoulder. At the minimum, it helps free your hands so you can eat Chinese 
takeout. Some places require you by law to use an earphone while driving 
(but only when you’re talking on a cellphone, of course).
	
We don’t recommend using your cellphone while driving, hands-free or not.
But RIM didn’t stop with just your standard wired earphones. BlackBerry also 
supports cool wireless earphones based on Bluetooth technology. How could 
a bizarrely colored tooth help you here? Bluetooth is the name for a (very) 
short-distance wireless technology that connects devices. See Chapter 14 for 
how to connect your BlackBerry to a Bluetooth headset.
Chew on a BlackBerry Storm
Reliability and quality were probably your main concerns when you decided 
on BlackBerry Storm. Will the product last? Will it perform like the manufac­
turer says? Will I regret having bought this item six months down the road? 

15
 Chapter 1: Your BlackBerry Is Not an Edible Fruit
This section looks at some of the hardware features that make buying the 
BlackBerry device a wise purchase.
BlackBerry OS 5.0
When the Storm rolled out, there was lots of talk about sluggishness with 
OS 4.7. With the new OS 5.0, which ships with Storm and Storm2, the user 
interface has improved greatly, with fast response time and an overall 
improvement over OS 4.7, true to the BlackBerry reputation.
Saving power
Anyone with BlackBerry experience knows that the BlackBerry is a highly 
efficient power consumer, but the addition of a colored, high-resolution 
touch screen has weakened the power efficiency. Power requirements have 
increased so much that you need to recharge roughly every two days.
We know frequent recharging is a bit of a hassle. but hey, now you have a 
sweet media player on deck! 
Putting a sentry on duty
The virtual world isn’t exempt from general human nastiness; in fact, every 
day a battle is fought between those who are trying to attack a system and 
those who are trying to protect it. Fortunately, security is a BlackBerry 
strong point.
A computer connected to the Internet faces an extra risk of being cracked by 
a hacker or infected by a virus. Viruses try to replicate themselves and gener­
ally bug you. Viruses often come as e-mail attachments. However, BlackBerry 
supports few file types out of the box (mostly images and documents). You 
won’t face threats from e-mails with these attachments. And data that you 
send to or get from the PDA is encrypted (coded) to prevent snooping.
See Chapter 3 for information on setting up a password for your BlackBerry.

Chapter 2
Navigating the BlackBerry Storm
In This Chapter
▶	Checking out the features of your BlackBerry Storm
▶	Introducing the touch screen
▶	Finding out how to type with your BlackBerry Storm’s virtual keyboards
Y
ou might have heard that the BlackBerry Storm is different from the 
other BlackBerry smart phones. From the outside, BlackBerry Storm 
has been completely revamped. Not only is it sleek and slim, but it also has 
a brighter, bigger, and higher-resolution screen than the older models. But 
what makes it fundamentally different? It has a touch screen.
What? No more trackball? No more QWERTY keyboard? How do you select 
and scroll with the touch screen? What can you do with it? We answer 
those questions in this chapter. Bear with us, and you will be master of your 
BlackBerry Storm in no time.
Exploring Your BlackBerry’s Face
In this section we show you all the keys and features on your BlackBerry 
Storm. You can see them in Figure 2-1.
First, read about the major features:
	
✓	SurePress touch screen: This screen is the graphical user interface (GUI) 
on your BlackBerry Storm. It lets you point to things using your finger 
instead of having to type.
	
✓	Virtual QWERTY keyboard: This is available on the Storm while you’re 
typing when you tilt the screen on its side (horizontally). You see all the 
keys individually as you would on a QWERTY BlackBerry. The QWERTY 
keyboard can also be shown in portrait mode (when the screen is verti­
cal) by changing the Options.

18
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry Storm 
	
✓	Virtual SureType keyboard: This keyboard layout appears while you’re 
typing with your Storm in portrait mode. Each virtual SureType key 
contains two letters. If you tweak the Screen/Keyboard Options, the 
SureType keyboard will not show up.
	
✓	Escape key: This key cancels a selection or returns you to a previous 
page in an application. The escape key is the arrow key to the left of the 
end key.
	
✓	Menu key (BlackBerry key): This key displays the full menu of the applica­
tion you’re using. Also, if you press and hold the menu key, it shows you a 
list of applications currently running. It’s like pressing Alt+Tab on a PC. See 
the “Switching applications” section, at the end of the chapter, for more.
	
✓	Convenience keys: Your BlackBerry Storm has two convenience keys 
that are, by default, preprogrammed to open an application. In Chapter 3, 
we show you how to reprogram the convenience keys to display the 
programs you use the most.
	
✓	microSD slot: You can access the microSD slot by removing the back 
cover, but without removing the battery. The microSD slot is a crucial 
element of your BlackBerry media experience.
	
✓	Send key: This key takes you straight to the Phone application, regard­
less of which application you’re currently using. If you’re already in the 
Phone application, the send key starts dialing the number you entered.
	
✓	End/Power key: Use this key to end your call. If you’re not on a phone 
call, this key allows you to jump back to the Home screen from wherever 
you are. Press and hold this key to turn your BlackBerry on or off.
	
	Most BlackBerry users exit an application to return to the Home screen by 
pressing the End key. However, this doesn’t actually close the application; 
instead, it leaves it the app running in the background. Yes, your Storm is 
a multitasking machine! (Holding down the menu key for an extra moment 
displays all open apps, allowing you to move between them quickly.) 
Although multitasking is a benefit, leaving an unused app running hogs your 
Storm’s precious memory resources, especially when that app is pulling 
data in regularly over your wireless connection. Make it a habit to close 
unused applications. You can do this by pressing the menu key in an open 
application and touch-pressing Close, which is typically the last choice 
on an app’s menu. You can also back your way out of most open apps by 
pressing the Escape/Back key repeatedly until you reach the Home screen. 
Closing unused apps helps keep your Storm running lightning fast.
	
✓	Mute key: Use this key to mutes a call when you’re on a call.
	
✓	Lock key: Press this key to quickly lock the BlackBerry screen. You’d 
use this when you want to put your BlackBerry in your pocket and pre­
vent accidental typing, for instance.

With so many combinations of settings available in your Storm, Research 
In Motion ships the device with defaults that should be acceptable to most 
users, though they may not be ideal for you. One of the first option screens 
a new Storm owner should visit is Screen/Keyboard, under Options. At the 
bottom is Touchscreen settings. Many people find that setting Sensitivity to 
High and the Tap Interval and Hover Period to their lowest setting (100) yields 
the best performance, as does setting Key Rate, also found on this screen, to 
Fast. Do your own experimenting to see what feels best for you. You’ll be using 
your touch screen a lot, so you definitely want it dialed in just right.

Using the SurePress Touch Screen
When you first turn on your BlackBerry, the display screen displays the 
Home screen, which is your introduction to your BlackBerry Storm’s graphi­
cal user interface. The different icons represent the different applications in 
your BlackBerry.
	
If you tilt your BlackBerry sideways, the screen follows you.
We use these terms to show you how to interact with your BlackBerry Storm:
	
✓	Tap by lightly touching. This action allows you to highlight a choice in 
a list or place the typing cursor in a particular place. Tapping does not, 
however, select or confirm a choice.
	
✓	Touch-press by firmly touching and pressing on something to select it.
	
✓	Finger-swipe by moving your finger from left to right or right to left 
across the screen. Usually, you use this action to go from one page to 
another page.
	
✓	Finger-scroll by keeping your finger on the touch screen and moving 
up, down, left, or right on the screen. You scroll to different parts of the 
screen.
Applications have a row of icons on the bottom of the screen. You can access 
these shortcuts without using the menu key. If this is your first touch-screen 
device, play and have fun with it. Trust us; it won’t bite.
Tapping the Keyboards: 
QWERTY and SureType
Surprised by the heading of this section? Just when you thought the term 
QWERTY wasn’t going to be part of this book, it is. That’s right. In the follow­
ing sections, we talk about the onscreen — or virtual — keyboards that you 
use to enter information.
Virtual QWERTY keyboard
You see the virtual QWERTY keyboard appear if you tilt your BlackBerry 
Storm sideways while entering text into a text field. See Figure 2-2.

21
 Chapter 2: Navigating the BlackBerry Storm
	
Figure 2-2: 
This 
BlackBerry 
Storm 
displays 
its virtual 
QWERTY 
keyboard.
	
	
You can hide the virtual keyboard by pressing the menu key and touch-pressing 
Hide Keyboard.
Whether you use your pinky or your index finger, how you type on your 
BlackBerry is up to you. However, most people find that typing with two 
thumbs is the most efficient way to type on a BlackBerry Storm. And like the 
SureType keyboard with its Custom Dictionary, the QWERTY keyboard helps 
you as you type so you can get the word out (literally) with less keystrokes.
	
A slight space down the middle divides the right and left sides of the virtual 
keyboard. Keeping your thumbs on their own sides of the keyboard goes a 
long way in helping with typing accuracy.
Virtual SureType keyboard
The SureType keyboard appears when you hold your BlackBerry Storm 
upright (vertical). Many keys share letters, as shown in Figure 2-3. The idea is 
that SureType is smart enough to figure out what letter you want. Basically, 
you can type with only one thumb, and your BlackBerry learns the words 
that you frequently use.
For example, if you want to type the word hi, press the GH key and then the 
UI key. SureType lists the words it thinks you’re typing, as shown in Figure 2-3. 
If the first word is what you want, simply touch the word or the virtual Space 
key. The word is selected and you can keep typing. If what you want appears 
a little later in the list, finger-scroll to the word and touch it.

22
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry Storm 
	
Figure 2-3: 
Did you 
want to type 
hi or gi?
	
	
These tips can speed up your SureType learning curve:
	
✓	Always finish typing a word before correcting it. This way, SureType 
learns what you want to type next time.
	
✓	If SureType correctly gets the word you’re typing (on the first try), use 
the space key to move on.
	
✓	Take advantage of Custom Dictionary, which is a list of words that you 
define. More on this later in this section.
	
✓	Type! Type! Type! Because SureType learns how you type, the more 
you use it, the faster it adapts.
Multitap
Besides using SureType, you can type in another mode while BlackBerry is 
upright: multitap. The best way to explain multitap is by example. Say you 
want to type an h character on the virtual SureType keyboard. You search 
out the h on your keyboard but notice the key reads GH. What’s a person to 
do? Do you really want to go through life writing GHello for Hello?
	
Your problem has a perfectly easy solution. To get the letter h, which is the 
second letter on the key, tap the key twice — hence, the term multitap. (To get 
the letter g, you would tap the GH key once.)

23
 Chapter 2: Navigating the BlackBerry Storm
Custom Dictionary
BlackBerry Storm keeps all its learned words in a safe place — Custom 
Dictionary, to be precise. You can review your Custom Dictionary — and 
even add to it — using the Custom Dictionary option.
	
Using the Custom Dictionary option to add words or proper names to the list 
means that SureType doesn’t have to learn them when you’re typing.
To see or add words by using the Custom Dictionary, follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Home screen, press the menu key and then touch-press the 
Options icon (wretch icon).
	
2.	Select Custom Dictionary.
	
	 The Custom Dictionary opens, listing all the words that the Storm has 
learned. (If you purchased your BlackBerry recently, the list might have 
only a few words or even no words.)
	
3.	Press the menu key and then touch-press New.
	
4.	To save your changes, press the menu key and then touch-press Save.
Getting people’s names right is tough with SureType, but fortunately, 
SureType can automatically learn all the names in Contacts as follows:
	
1.	From the Home screen, press the menu key and then touch-press the 
options icon.
	
2.	Touch-press the Language and Text Input option.
	
	The Language option screen appears. This screen is where the handy 
Input Option button makes its home.
	
3.	Touch-press the Show Text Input Option button.
	
	 The Input Options screen appears, with the following options:
 
• Auto Word Learning: If this option is on, the Storm learns as you type.
 
• Use Contacts as Data Source: If this option is on, the Storm learns 
all the names in your Contacts.
 
• Learn Words from Email Messages: You can choose All Messages 
or Contacts Only.
 
• Predictive: If this option is on, every time you type, the Storm dis­
plays possible choices to predict the word you are typing. This can 
be a timesaver.
 
• Include Spell Check Variants: This is related to the Predictive Input 
option. If turned on, the predictive choice list includes different 
spelling variants.

24
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry Storm 
	
4.	Make sure the Use Contacts as Data Source option is selected.
	
	 If it isn’t, touch-press the check box to select it.
	
5.	To save your changes, press the menu key and then touch-press Save.
	
You’ll be most efficient with your Storm if you master all the keyboards avail­
able and use the appropriate orientation and layout at the right time. Many 
people get comfortable with one keyboard layout — for example, using land­
scape with the full QWERTY — but you’ll find you can do everything faster if 
you mix things up a bit:
	
✓	Portrait, SureType: Invest the time to learn the SureType keyboard. 
Although at first it’s weird to see two letters on one key, the predictive 
text works well, and holding the keyboard in portrait mode and typing 
with two thumbs allows you to keep your words per minute impres­
sively high. For typing e-mails, this mode is our favorite.
	
✓	Portrait, full keyboard: If you have solid dexterity with your thumbs, 
the full keyboard in portrait orientation most closely approximates the 
full physical keyboard on other BlackBerry smart phones such as the 
Bold and Curve. If you can use this keyboard comfortably, it’s likely the 
one you’ll grow to like best, but many owners find the spacing a little too 
tight for two-thumb typing.
	
✓	Landscape, full keyboard: When it comes to typing e-mail addresses, 
Web site URLs, short text messages with slang, or information such as 
names into the Address Book, we turn the Storm sideways to use the 
full QWERTY keyboard. Portrait keyboards reduce the physical dis­
tance your fingers have to travel, thus allowing you to reduce the time 
between typing out letters and to go quicker.
	
✓	Multitap: With two full keyboards at your disposal, Research In Motion 
could remove this option and receive no complaints!
Practice makes perfect! Get familiar with the different keyboard options.
Physical Keys and More
Although you will do most of the key entry on the Storm through the 
onscreen keyboards (see the “Tapping the Keyboards: QWERTY and 
SureType” section, earlier in this chapter), a few physical keys will help you 
navigate the user interface of your Storm more quickly:
	
✓	Escape key: Simple yet useful, the escape key allows you to return to a 
previous screen or cancel a selection. The escape key is the arrow key 
to the left of the end key.
	
✓	Menu key (BlackBerry key): The menu key brings up the full menu 
for the application you are using. When you’re on the Home screen, 

25
 Chapter 2: Navigating the BlackBerry Storm
pressing the menu key displays a list of applications installed on your 
BlackBerry. 
	
✓	Convenience keys: Your BlackBerry Storm has two convenience keys, 
one on the left and one on the right. By default, the right convenience 
key opens the Camera and the left convenience key opens the voice com­
mand application. Think of these two keys as shortcuts to the application 
you need fast access to. You can program and change these keys to open 
whatever is installed on your BlackBerry; see Chapter 3 for more info.
microSD slot
Your BlackBerry Storm comes with 1GB of internal memory. If you’re a music 
or video fan, however, you know that 1GB isn’t enough to hold anything enter­
taining. But no need to worry. The folks at Research In Motion incorporated a 
microSD (external memory card) slot into your BlackBerry Storm so you can 
add memory and store all the media files you want in your BlackBerry Storm. 
You can purchase a microSD card separately for a relatively low price these 
days. At the time of this writing, a 4GB microSD card costs $20.
Switching applications
When you are moving around in an application (such as Browser), an option 
called Switch Application appears when you press and hold the menu key for 
2 seconds. Switch Application, which is similar to Alt+Tab in Windows, lets 
you multitask between applications. The Switch Application pop-up menu 
appears in Figure 2-4.
	
You can program the convenience key so you can get to your favorite appli­
cation, such as the Tasks application, even more quickly than by using the 
Switch Application function.

Y
ou want to have your BlackBerry around as long as you possibly can 
(or at least until you have the bucks for that way-cool new model that’s 
coming down the pike). And for the time that you do have your device, you’ll 
want to trick it out. (C’mon, admit it — your BlackBerry is definitely a fashion 
statement.)
In addition to customizing, you want to keep your BlackBerry in tip-top shape 
by watching out for things such as information security. Luckily for you, this 
chapter fills you in on all you need to know to keep your BlackBerry Storm a 
finely tuned (and yet quirkily personal) little smart phone.
Making Your BlackBerry Yours
BlackBerry Storm smart phones are increasingly popular — so much so that 
millions of BlackBerry Storms are out there serving the needs of people like 
you. Because of this fact, we’re certain that finding ways to distinguish your 
BlackBerry from your colleagues’ is high on your list of priorities.
Your wish is our command. Follow the tips and techniques outlined in this 
section, and you, too, can personalize to your heart’s content.

Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry Storm 
Branding your BlackBerry
Like any number of other electronic gadgets, your BlackBerry Storm comes 
to you with a collection of settings. This section helps you put your name on 
your BlackBerry Storm, both figuratively and literally.
You can start by branding your name on your BlackBerry Storm:
	
1.	Press the menu key and touch-press the options icon.
	
2.	Touch-press Owner Options.
	
	 You see places to enter your owner information.
	
3.	Enter your name in the Name field and your contact information in 
the Information field.
	
	 Phrase a message that would make sense to any possible Good Samaritan 
who might find your lost BlackBerry and want to get it back to you.
	
	 If you lock or don’t use your BlackBerry for a while, the standby screen 
displays the owner information that you entered. Read how to lock your 
BlackBerry, either manually or by using an auto setting, as described in 
the later section, “Keeping Your BlackBerry Safe.”
	
4.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
Choosing a language, any language
Set the language to your native tongue so you don’t need to hire a translator 
to use your BlackBerry. You can also set your input method of choice here, 
which can affect whether AutoText shows up. Don’t worry. We explain what 
that means in the next section.
Here’s how you choose a language:
	
1.	Press the menu key and touch-press the options icon.
	
2.	Touch-press the Language and Text Input option.
	
	 Here, you can choose the language and input method.
	
3.	Touch-press the Language field and then select your native (or pre­
ferred) tongue.
	
	 Language choices vary depending on your network provider and region 
(North America, Europe, and so on). Most handhelds sold in North 
America default to English or English (United States).
	
	 If your network provider supports it, you can install more languages in 
your BlackBerry by using Application Loader in BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager. For more information on Application Loader, see Chapter 18.

29
 Chapter 3: Whipping Up a Storm of Your Own
	
4.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
	
	 Isn’t it great when you can actually read what’s on the screen? But don’t 
think you’re finished quite yet. You still have some personalizing to do.
Typing with ease using AutoText
Even the most devoted BlackBerry user has to admit that typing on a full 
keyboard is easier than thumb-typing on a BlackBerry. To even the score a 
bit, your BlackBerry Storm comes with an AutoText feature, which is a kind 
of shorthand.
	
AutoText basically works with a pool of abbreviations that you set up. Then 
you type an abbreviation to get the word you associated with that abbrevia­
tion. For example, after setting up b/c as an AutoText word for because, any 
time you type b/c, you automatically get because onscreen.
	
The whole AutoText thing works only if you set up your own personal code, 
mapping your abbreviations to their meanings. (This is why we’re discussing 
AutoText as part of the personalization discussion.)
To set up your own code, do the following:
	
1.	Press the menu key and touch-press the options icon.
	
2.	Touch-press the AutoText option.
	
	 You can choose to see (or search for) existing AutoText words or create 
new ones.
	
3.	Press the menu key and touch-press New.
	
	The AutoText screen appears, as shown in Figure 3-1.
	
Figure 3-1: 
Create 
AutoText 
here.

Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry Storm 
	
4.	In the Replace field, enter the characters that you want to replace.
	
5.	In the With field, type what replaces your characters.
	
6.	Choose between two options in the Using field:
 
• SmartCase capitalizes the first letter when the context calls for 
that, such as the first word in a sentence.
 
• Specified Case replaces your AutoText with the exact text in the 
With field.
	
	 Say you have the AutoText cbweb set up for the term crackberry.com, 
and you want it to appear as is, in terms of letter cases (always lower­
case the first c). If you choose SmartCase for this AutoText entry, and 
it’s the first word in a sentence, the word is capitalized; that isn’t what 
you want. On the other hand, if you use Specified Case, your AutoText 
always appears as crackberry.com no matter where it is in the sentence.
	
7.	Scroll to the Language field, and touch-press All Locales.
	
	 We prefer All Locales because regardless of the language input method 
(for example, French), any self-created AutoText is available for you 
to use. In the case of the AutoText cbweb (crackberry.com), you can 
use this AutoText whether you’re typing in French or Chinese. On the 
other hand, if you select only the French input method for cbweb as the 
Language field, you could use only the cbweb AutoText entry if your 
input method is set to French in the Language option.
	
	 You can choose the input method in the Language options. We go over 
choosing a language input method next.
	
8.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
	
If you specify a language input method other than All Locales, your input 
method setting in the Language option must match the Language field in 
AutoText to use your newly created AutoText:
	
1.	Press the menu key and touch-press the options icon.
	
2.	Touch-press Language and Text Input Option.
	
	 Here, you can choose the language and input method.
	
3.	Select the Input Language field and then select the input method you 
need from the list.
	
	 For your new AutoText setting to work (assuming that you didn’t choose 
All Locales as the language for your AutoText), this option needs to 
match the input method set in your Language option.
	
4.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save.

31
 Chapter 3: Whipping Up a Storm of Your Own
	
If Word Completion is enabled, word suggestions appear above your sentence, 
suggesting the full word you are in the middle of typing. Instead of completing 
the word, you can select the full word from the list of suggestions. We find 
Word Completion distracting and prefer to use Auto Correction, which is less 
invasive and still does an okay job. If Word Completion’s pop-up word sugges­
tions bug you, changing to Auto Correction will make them disappear!
Inserting text shortcuts
If you frequently give out your BlackBerry phone number or PIN in e-mails, you’ll 
appreciate what we call text shortcuts. Basically, you can use the AutoText feature 
to add a customized word for preset items — things such as your BlackBerry 
number, PIN, or just the date — so you don’t have to type them all the time.
	
Keep in mind that we’re talking about your BlackBerry PIN here — your 
device’s unique identifying number — and not the PIN someone would use to 
empty out your checking account with the help of one of those automated tell­
ers. For more on BlackBerry PINs, see Chapter 8.
To add a text shortcut for your phone number, for example, follow these steps:
	
1.	Display the AutoText screen.
	
	 AutoText is an option in Options.
	
2.	Type an appropriate word in the Replace field.
	
	 mynum would work nicely.
	
3.	Touch-press the With field and type “my number is ”.
	
4.	Press the menu key and choose Insert Macro.
	
	 You’re prompted with a list of preset items.
	
5.	Select the Phone Number (%p) option.
	
6.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
	
7.	Test your AutoText by drafting a simple e-mail and typing mynum.
Customizing your screen’s look and feel
You can get the display font, font size, and screen contrast to your liking. 
Now we know that some of you don’t give a hoot if your fonts are Batang or 
Bookman as long as you can read the text, but we also know that some of you 
won’t stop configuring the fonts until you get them absolutely right.

32
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry Storm 
For all you tweakers out there, here’s how you play around with your 
BlackBerry’s fonts:
	
1.	Press the menu key and touch-press the options icon.
	
2.	Touch-press Screen/Keyboard.
	
	 The Screen/Keyboard screen appears with various customizable fields, 
as shown in Figure 3-2.
	
Figure 3-2: 
The Screen/
Keyboard 
screen is 
waiting for 
personaliza-
tion.
	
	
3.	Touch-press the Font Family field and then touch-press a font from the 
drop-down list.
	
4.	Continuing down the Screen/Keyboard screen, touch-press the Font 
Size field and then touch-press a font size.
	
	 The smaller the font size, the more you can see onscreen; however, a 
small font is harder on the eyes.
	
	 Note: As you finger-scroll up and down the list of fonts and font sizes, 
notice that the text The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog in the 
background takes on the look of the selected font and size so that you 
can preview what the particular text looks like.
	
5.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
With fonts out of the way, it’s time to change the brightness of your screen 
as well as a few other viewing options, including how to program the conve­
nience keys so every time you press it, the convenience key opens the appli­
cation that you use most often:

33
 Chapter 3: Whipping Up a Storm of Your Own
	
1.	Press the menu key and touch-press the options icon.
	
2.	Touch-press Screen/Keyboard.
	
3.	Touch-press the Backlight Brightness field and then select the desired 
brightness from the drop-down list.
	
	 You can choose 10 to 100, where 10 is the darkest and 100 is the brightest.
	
4.	Touch-press the Backlight Timeout field and choose an amount of 
time.
	
	 You can choose ten seconds up to two minutes. The lower this set­
ting, the less time you’ll have backlighting (after you press each key). 
However, a low setting helps you conserve battery life.
	
5.	Touch-press the Tap Interval field and decide how sensitive you want 
the tap to be.
	
	 You can choose 100 to 500, where 100 is the most sensitive and 500 is 
the least sensitive.
	
6.	Touch-press the Hover Period field and decide how sensitive you want 
your touch on the touch screen to be.
	
	 Here, 100 is the most sensitive and 1000 is the least sensitive. Keep in 
mind that if your setting is too sensitive, it might be hard to control.
	
	 When you hover your finger over an icon or link without touch-pressing 
the screen, a small yellow text box appears, giving you hints at what you 
can expect by touch-pressing the icon.
	
7.	To confirm your changes, press the menu key and touch-press Save.
Programming the left and 
right convenience keys
The folks at RIM have given the Storm left and right convenience keys as 
a way for you to quickly get to the programs you use the most often. By 
default, the left convenience key is set to open the voice dialing app, and the 
right convenience key opens the Camera app.
If you want to setup your convenience keys differently, here’s what you can do:
	
1.	Press the menu key and touch-press the options icon.
	
2.	Touch-press Screen/Keyboard.
	
3.	Touch-press Left Side Convenience Key Opens field.
	
4.	Touch-press an application that you want the convenience key to open.
	
	Typically, we set these keys to open applications we often need, such as 
the Browser or Task application.

34
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry Storm 
	
5.	Touch-press Right Side Convenience Key Opens field.
	
6.	Touch-press an application you want the Right Convenience key to open.
	
7.	To confirm your changes, press the menu key and touch-press Save.
Choosing themes
Your BlackBerry might be preloaded with different themes, which are pre­
defined sets of looks (wallpaper, fonts, menu layout) for your BlackBerry. 
You can download themes from BlackBerry’s mobile Web site.
Regardless of what BlackBerry model you have, follow these steps to change 
your theme:
	
1.	Press the menu key and touch-press the options icon.
	
2.	Touch-press the Theme option.
	
	 You see a list of available themes; your Storm may come with only one 
theme, but you can always download more.
	
3.	Touch-press the theme you want.
	
4.	Press the menu key and touch-press Activate.
	
	You see the change after a short wait.
	
You can download other themes. Just remember that you have to use your 
BlackBerry, not your PC, to access the following URLs:
	
✓	http://mobile.blackberry.com
	
✓	http://blackberrywallpaper.com
Wallpapering
Like your desktop PC, the BlackBerry Home screen can be customized with 
personalized wallpaper.
You set an image to be your BlackBerry Home screen background by using 
the BlackBerry Media application:
	
1.	From the Home screen, press the menu key and touch-press the Media 
application.
	
	 The Media application opens, showing several icons: Music, Videos, 
Pictures, Ring Tones, Voice Notes, Video Camera, and Voice Notes 
Recorder.

2.	Touch-press the Picture category.
	
	 Doing so brings up three options:
 
• All Pictures shows you a thumbnail view of all your photos — the 
ones you took and the ones that came with your BlackBerry Storm.
 
• Picture Folders lists the folders that contain photos, as well as a 
thumbnail list of the photos.
 
• Sample Pictures shows you a thumbnail view of the pictures that 
came with your BlackBerry Storm.
	
3.	Touch-press All Pictures.
	
4.	Touch-press the picture you want to use for your Home screen 
wallpaper.
	
	 The selected picture appears in full-screen view.
	
5.	Press the menu key and touch-press Set As.
	
	 The picture is now your new Home screen wallpaper.
	
6.	Press and hold the escape key to return to the Home screen and see 
the result.
	
	 If you hold your BlackBerry Storm in its upright (vertical) position, you 
see your new wallpaper.
	
You can download free wallpaper here as long as you use your BlackBerry, not 
your PC, to access the URLs:
	
✓	http://mobile.blackberry.com
	
✓	blackberrywallpapers.com
After you have your BlackBerry’s look and feel just the way you want, do one 
more thing before you move on: Get your BlackBerry sounding the way you 
want it to.
Ringing freedom
The whole appeal of the BlackBerry phenomenon is the idea that this little 
electronic device can make your life easier. One of the ways it accomplishes 
this is by acting as your personal reminder service — letting you know when 
an appointment is coming up, a phone call is coming in, an e-mail has arrived, 
and so on. Basically, your BlackBerry is set to bark at you if it knows some­
thing it thinks you should know too. Figure 3-3 lists the kinds of things your 
BlackBerry considers bark-worthy, ranging from Message alerts to Calendar 
reminders.

36
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry Storm 
	
Figure 3-3:

Different people react differently to different sounds. Some BlackBerry barks 
would be greatly appreciated by certain segments of the population, whereas 
other segments might react to the same sound by pitching their BlackBerry 
under the nearest bus. The folks at Research In Motion are well aware of this 
fact and have devised a great way for you to customize how you want your 
BlackBerry to bark at you; they call it your profile.
You can jump right into things by using a predefined profile.
Checking out the different profiles
Each profile is divided into four categories that represent the application for 
which you can define alerts:
	
✓	Phone: Alerts you if there is an incoming call or a new voice mail.
	
✓	Messages: Alerts you when a new e-mail (see Chapter 8), PIN message, 
or SMS message is in your inbox.
	
✓	Reminders: Alerts you when you have upcoming calendar appointments 
or to-do reminders.
	
✓	Follow Up Flags: Alerts you when you have e-mail or phone calls to 
follow up on.
	
✓	Browser: Alerts you when you receive a new channel push, which is a 
Web page sent to your BlackBerry as an icon on your Home screen.
You can personalize the alert on all listed applications. Because the way you 
customize them is similar, we use one application (Messages) as an example 
in the text that follows, as we customize a predefined profile that comes with 
your BlackBerry.

Customizing a predefined profile
If you’re okay with customizing a predefined, factory-loaded profile, just do 
the following:
	
1.	From the BlackBerry Home screen, touch-press the Sounds application.
	
	A screen lists different sound profiles: Normal (Active), Loud, Medium, 
Vibrate Only, Silent, Phone Calls Only, or All Alerts Off. See Figure 3-4.
	
Figure 3-4: 
A Profile 
application 
helps you 
personalize.
	
	
2.	Touch-press Set Ring Tones/Alerts.
	
	 A screen lists different applications. Note that you are setting the ring 
tones/alerts for whatever sound profile is currently selected. For exam­
ple, if you’re currently using Normal, when you touch-press Set Ring 
Tones/Alerts, you are modifying the Normal profile’s setting.
	
3.	Touch-press Messages to expand the category.
	
	 If you have multiple e-mail accounts routed to your BlackBerry, you can 
set settings for each. Note that SMS and PIN messages are also listed in 
the Message category.
	
4.	Touch-press one of your e-mail accounts.
	
5.	Touch-press the Ring Tone field and then touch-press a tune from the 
drop-down list.
	
	 Doing so enables sound when e-mail arrives for this e-mail account. If 
you want any sounds to play, you can choose this in the Volume field.

38
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry Storm 
	
6.	Touch-press the Volume field and then touch-press to select the 
volume level you desire.
	
	 You can choose options ranging from silent to 10 for loudest.
	
7.	 Touch-press the Vibration field and then touch-press Custom.
	
	 This displays more options for vibration. You can control how many 
vibrations each e-mail triggers, the vibration duration, and whether you 
want the vibration to happen when your Storm is in its holster.
	
8.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
	
	 As mentioned earlier, you can follow these same steps to personalize 
other applications listed in each profile.
	
Maybe you get a lot of e-mail. You probably don’t want your BlackBerry 
sounding off 200 times a day. Set your BlackBerry Storm to notify you only if 
an e-mail is marked urgent, requiring your immediate attention.
Keeping Your BlackBerry Safe
	
The folks at Research In Motion take security seriously, and so should you. 
Make sure you set up a password on your BlackBerry. If your BlackBerry 
hasn’t prompted you to set up a password, you should immediately do so.
Follow these steps to set up a password:
	
1.	From the BlackBerry Home screen, touch-press the options icon.
	
2.	Touch-press Password.
	
3.	Touch-press Disable Settings and select Enabled.
	
4.	Touch-press Security Timeout and select a time.
	
	 Choose anywhere from 1 minute up to 1 hour.
	
5.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
	
	 You’re prompted for a password.
	
6.	Type a password and then type it again for verification.
	
	 From this point on, whenever you lock your BlackBerry and want to 
use it again, you have to type the password. If you don’t use your 
BlackBerry, it locks according to Security Timeout setting.
Setting up your password is a good first step, but just having a password 
won’t help much if you don’t take the further step of locking your BlackBerry 
when you’re not using it. (You don’t want people at the office or sitting at

the next table at the coffee shop checking out your e-mails or phone his­
tory when you take a bathroom break, do you?) How do you lock your 
BlackBerry? Press the lock key, which is on the top left of your Storm.
	
You can customize your Storm to use different alerts (such as ring tones or 
vibrations) for different events (e-mail, SMS, and so on) in different situa­
tions (Normal profile, Loud profile, and so on). You can even set unique ring 
tone alerts for individuals when they call or message you. However, some 
people want even more control. One application, BerryBuzz, has proved to be 
extremely popular, allowing you to take your notifications to the next level of 
customization by setting unique LED colors for incoming events. You can find 
it in the CrackBerry App Store under BerryBuzz or in App World under BeBuzz.

Your BlackBerry Storm Contacts feature serves the same function as 
any other: to record and organize information about people. It also gives you 
a central place to reach your contacts by landline phone; cellphone; e-mail; 
or the speedy messaging of PIN, SMS, MMS, or BlackBerry Messenger.
You can benefit from using BlackBerry Contacts if any of the following fits 
you and your lifestyle:
	
✓	You travel.
	
✓	You meet clients frequently.
	
✓	You spend a lot of time on the phone.
	
✓	You ask people for their phone number or e-mail address more than once.
	
✓	You carry around a paper day planner.
	
✓	Your wallet is full of important business cards, with phone numbers 
written on the backs, that you can never find.

Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
If you’re one of those stubborn folks who insist that they don’t need an 
address book — “I’m doing just fine without one, thank you very much!” — 
perhaps you need to think of it another way. You’ve been using a virtual 
address book all the time: the one buried in your cellphone. And that address 
book often isn’t even a very good one! Read this chapter to see how to trans­
fer all that good contact info from an old phone into your new BlackBerry-
based Contacts.
Accessing Contacts
The Contacts icon looks like an old-fashioned address book. (Remember 
those? Maybe not.) If you have a hard time locating it, check out Figure 4-1. 
Opening Contacts couldn’t be simpler: Just touch-press the Contacts icon.
	
Figure 4-1: 
 The 
Contacts 
icon.
	
You can access Contacts from Phone, Messages, BlackBerry Messenger, 
and Calendar. Say you’re in Calendar, and you want to invite people to one 
of your meetings. Look no further — Invite Attendee (essentially, displays 
Contacts) is on the menu, ready to lend a helping hand.
	
Because the Storm does not have a physical keyboard, you lose the speed 
inherent in keyboard shortcuts. App developer NikkiSoft introduced 
QuickLaunch for the original BlackBerry Storm, and it remains a must-have 
app. QuickLaunch enables you to set shortcuts for common tasks, such as 
calling your significant other, e-mailing your boss, or visiting a specific Web 
site. Setting a convenience key to open QuickLaunch allows you to access 
these shortcut commands immediately, saving time and touch-screen presses.

 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances
Working with Contacts
Getting a new gizmo is always exciting; your new toy is full of features you’re 
dying to try out. Calling someone was probably the first thing you wanted to 
do with your new BlackBerry Storm. But wait a second. You’ll have to type the 
phone number not just this time, but each time you want to call. What a hassle.
Most people — social creatures that we are — keep a list of contacts some­
where such as in an e-mail program, in an old cellphone, or on a piece of 
paper (tucked away in a wallet). We’re pretty sure you have some kind of list 
somewhere. The trick is getting that list into your BlackBerry Storm so you 
can access the info more efficiently. The good news is that getting the infor­
mation into your BlackBerry Storm isn’t hard.
	
Often, the simplest way to get contact information into your BlackBerry Storm 
is to enter it manually. However, if you’ve invested a lot of time keeping the 
information updated on your desktop computer, you might want to hot-sync 
that data into your BlackBerry Storm. For more on synchronizing data, check 
Chapter 15.
Creating a contact
Imagine you’ve just run into Jane, an old high-school friend you haven’t seen 
in years. Jane wants to give you her number, but you don’t have a pen handy. 
Are you forced to chant her phone number to yourself until you can scare up 
a writing implement? Not if you have your handy BlackBerry Storm on you.
With BlackBerry Storm in hand, follow these steps to create a new contact:
	
1.	On the Home screen, touch-press the Contacts icon.
	
	 Contacts opens. You can also access Contacts from different applica­
tions. For example, check Chapter 7 on how to access Contacts from 
Messages.
	
2.	Touch-press the plus icon located at the bottom of the screen.
	
	 The New Contact screen appears, as shown in Figure 4-2.
	
3.	Enter the contact information in the appropriate fields.
	
	 Use your BlackBerry Storm virtual keyboard to enter contact informa­
tion. Hold the device sideways (landscape) to get the full QWERTY key­
board. When entering an e-mail address, press the Space key to insert an 
at symbol (@) or a period (.).
	
	 We don’t think you can overdo it when entering a person’s contact infor­
mation. Enter as much info as you possibly can. Maybe the benefit won’t 
be obvious now, but when your memory fails or your boss needs a criti­
cal piece of data that you happen to have, you’ll thank us for this advice.

46
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
	
	 To create another new, blank e-mail field for the same contact, press the 
menu key and touch-press Add Email Address. You can have up to three 
e-mail addresses per contact.
	
	 BlackBerry Storm can dial an extension after the initial phone number. 
When entering the phone number, type the primary phone number, 
touch-press P on the virtual keyboard, and add the extension number.
	
4.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
	
	 Jane is added to the list, as shown in Figure 4-3.
	
Here’s something slick to know when you’re entering phone information for a 
contact: BlackBerry Storm can also dial an extra number after the initial phone 
number. That extra number can be someone’s extension, a participant code 
on a conference number, or simply your voice mail PIN. When you’re entering 
the contact’s phone number, type the primary phone number, enter X, and 
then add the extension number. Say you enter 11112345678X1111; when you 
tell your Storm to call that number, it will dial 11112345678 first. Then you’ll 
see a prompt asking you to continue or skip dialing the extension.
	
The menu is always available through the menu key. The application is smart 
enough to figure out which items are more relevant based on what you’re 
doing. You can always touch-press the full menu listing.
Taking notes
The Notes field in the New Contact screen (you might need to scroll down a 
bit to see it) is useful for adding a description about your contact. For exam­
ple, use the field to jog your memory with tidbits such as Knows someone at 
ABC Corporation or Can provide introduction to a Broadway agent. Or perhaps 
your note is something personal, such as Likes golf; has 2 children: boy, 7 & 
girl, 3; husband’s name is Ray. It’s up to you. Again, the more useful the infor­
mation, the better it serves you.
Adding your own fields
Perhaps your contact information doesn’t fit into any of the available fields. 
Although you can’t create fields from scratch, you can commandeer one of 
the User fields for your own purposes.
The User fields are at the bottom of the screen; you have to scroll down to 
see them. Use these fields any way you want; you can even change the field’s 
name. For example, you can rename User fields to capture suffixes (such as 
MD, PhD, and so on) or things such as
	
✓	Profession
	
✓	Hobbies
	
✓	School
	
✓	Nickname

to one of the User fields.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Change Field Name.
	
	 Note: The Change Field Name selection on the menu appears only if the 
cursor is in a User field.

5.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
	
	 You’re all set.

Adding a picture to a contact
Most phones can display a picture of whoever’s calling; BlackBerry Storm is 
no stranger to this neat feature:
	
1.	Have a picture of the person.
	
	 See Chapter 11 for more about taking photos with your BlackBerry Storm.
	
2.	Get the photo to your BlackBerry Storm.
	
	 You can send it via e-mail, copy it to the microSD card, or copy it to the 
built-in memory of Storm. If you don’t know how to use a microSD card, 
Chapter 12 is your gateway to media satisfaction.
	
3.	From the Home screen, touch-press the Contacts icon.
	
4.	Touch a contact.
	
	 The contact is highlighted.
	
5.	Press the menu key and touch-press Edit.
	
	 The Edit screen appears.
	
6.	Press the menu key and touch-press Add Picture; see Figure 4-4.
	
Figure 4-4: 
Add a 
picture 
here.
	
	
7.	Navigate to the drive and folder that has the picture.
	
	 You can use multiple locations for storing media files (including 
pictures). Chapter 12 gives you the scoop.
	
8.	Touch-press the picture you want.
	
	 The picture appears on the screen with a rectangle over it.
	
9.	Slide the picture to position the rectangle over the face.
	
	 Contacts uses a tiny image, just enough to show the face of a person. The 
rectangle you see here indicates how the application crops the image.

10.	Press the menu key and touch-press Crop and Save.
	
11.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
Assigning a tone
Oh, no — your ringing BlackBerry has woken you. Ring tones help you decide 
whether to ignore the call or get up. We hope you can easily switch yourself 
to sleep mode if you ignore the call.
Follow these steps to assign a ring tone to one of your contacts:
	
1.	While editing a contact, scroll to the Custom Ring Tones/Alerts section.
	
	 Under the Ring Tones/Alerts section, you see Phone and Messages. You 
can customize the ring tone when you receive a call and when you have 
a new message such as an e-mail or an SMS.
	
2.	Touch-press Phone and customize the ring tone on the screen that 
follows.
	
	 You can change the following options:
 
• Ring Tone: Select from a list of ring tones here.
 
• Volume: Control the volume. Values are Active Profile (the default) 
and 1 to 10 (loudest).
 
• Play Sound: Control in what state to play the tone. Values are 
Active Profile (the default), In Holster, Out of Holster, and Always.
 
• LED: Use the LED to indicate a call.
 
• Vibration: Enable vibration as a way of notification. Choices are 
Active Profile (the default), Off, On, and Custom. Custom enables 
you to control how long you want the vibration to last.
 
• Vibrate with Ring Tone: Choose between vibration and play the 
tone. Choices are Active Profile (the default), On, and Off.
	
3.	Press the escape key and touch-press Save.
	
	 You’re back to the Edit Contact screen.
	
4.	Touch-press Messages.
	
	 You are presented with the Messages screen, allowing you to customize 
the ring tone when you receive a message. You can do all the customiza­
tions listed in Step 2 plus the following:
 
• Notify Me During Calls: Toggle notification while you are actively 
on a call. Your choices are Yes and No (the default).
 
• Count: Set the number of times the ring tone repeats. Choices are 
Active Profile (the default), 1, 2, and 3.

50
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
	
5.	Press the escape key.
	
6.	Press the menu key and then touch-press Save.
	
Spend a little time adding your own contact records. We recommend adding 
at least one record for your business contact info and one for your personal 
contact info. This saves you time having to type your own contact information 
every time you want to give it to someone. You can share your contact record 
by sending it as an attachment to an e-mail. (See the later section “Sharing a 
Contact.”)
Adding contacts from other 
BlackBerry applications
When you get an e-mail message, it’s a logical time to add the e-mail address 
information into Contacts. The same is true when you get a phone call, which 
gives you a phone number within the Phone application. You might have 
noticed that Phone lists only outgoing numbers. That’s half of what you need. 
Oddly enough, you can access incoming phone calls in Messages:
	
1.	Touch-press Messages from the Home screen.
	
	 Messages opens.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press View Folder.
	
3.	Touch-press Phone Call Logs.
	
A phone log entry stays as long as you have free space in your BlackBerry 
Storm. When BlackBerry runs out of space (which could take years, depending 
on how you use it), it deletes read e-mails and phone logs, starting from the 
oldest.
	
You can view device memory info; touch-press Memory from the Home 
screen, touch-press Options, and then touch-press Memory. The screen dis­
plays three types of memory: Application Memory, Device Memory, and Media 
Card. Pay close attention to Application Memory, because this is where your 
applications are installed, including data from out-of-the-box applications such 
as Contacts, Messages, Calendar, and Web Browser cache. Your Storm has 
limited Application Memory (128MB for the original Storm and 256MB for the 
Storm2). If free Application Memory drops below 10MB, your device might 
begin to slow down a bit, and if it approaches 0MB, you may experience lag. At 
this point, you need to free some space. Pulling the battery will immediately 
net some space, because applications that were running and using persis­
tent memory will now be closed. Deleting unused applications helps, as does 
removing unnecessary bloatware that comes preloaded on the device (such 

51
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances
as movie trailers and sample photos). You can visit www.crackberry.com 
for step-by-step tutorials on freeing up application memory.
Creating a contact from an existing e-mail address or phone number in 
Messages is easy:
	
1.	Touch-press Messages from the Home screen.
	
	 Messages opens.
	
2.	Touch the e-mail address or the phone number.
	
	 A menu appears.
	
3.	Touch-press Add to Contacts.
	
	 A New Contact screen appears, filled with that particular piece of 
information.
	
4.	Enter the rest of the information you know.
	
5.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
This is just one more sign of BlackBerry’s ongoing attempt to make your life 
easier.
Viewing a contact
You just entered your friend’s name into your BlackBerry, but you have 
this nagging thought that you typed the wrong phone number. You want to 
quickly view the information. Here’s how you do it:
	
1.	On the Home screen, touch-press the Contacts icon.
	
	 Contacts opens.
	
2.	Scroll to and touch-press the contact name you want.
	
	 Touch-pressing the name is the same as opening the menu and choosing 
View — just faster.
	
	 View mode displays only information that’s been filled in, as shown in 
Figure 4-5. It doesn’t bother showing fields that have no information.
Editing a contact
Change is an inevitable part of life. If you want to keep current the informa­
tion you diligently put in your contacts list, you’ll have to do some updating 
now and then.

52
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
	
Figure 4-5: 
View mode 
for a 
contact.
	
To update a contact, follow these steps:
	
1.	On the BlackBerry Storm Home screen, touch-press the Contacts icon.
	
	 Contacts opens.
	
2.	Scroll to and highlight a contact name and press the menu key.
	
3.	Touch-press Edit.
	
	 The Edit Contact screen appears.
	
	 In any BlackBerry Storm application, including Contacts, you can display 
a menu by pressing the menu key. You see the Edit option in the menu 
right below View.
	
4.	Edit the contact information as you see fit.
	
	 Hold the device sideways to get the full QWERTY keyboard.
	
5.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
	
	 The edit you made for this contact is saved.
	
When you’re editing information and want to replace the entry, clear the con­
tents. When you’re in an editable field (as opposed to a selectable field), just 
press the menu key and touch-press Clear Field. This feature is always avail­
able for an editable field.
Deleting a contact
It’s time to get rid of someone’s contact information in your contacts list. 
Maybe it’s a case of duplication or a bit of bad blood. Either way, BlackBerry 
Storm makes it easy to delete a contact:

53
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances
	
1.	On the Home screen, touch-press the Contacts icon.
	
	 Contacts opens.
	
2.	Scroll to and highlight the contact name you want to delete.
	
3.	Touch-press the Delete (x) icon at the bottom of the screen.
	
	 A confirmation screen appears, as shown in Figure 4-6.
	
4.	Touch-press Delete.
	
	 The contact disappears from your contacts list.
	
Figure 4-6: 
The con-
firmation 
screen 
when you’re 
about to 
delete a 
contact.
	
	
Dealing with the confirmation screen can be a pain if you want to delete sev­
eral contacts in a row. If you’re 100 percent sure you want to ditch a number 
of contacts, you can suspend the Confirmation feature by setting the Confirm 
Delete option to No in the Contacts Options screen. Check the “Setting prefer­
ences” section, later in this chapter, for more on Contacts options.
Copying Contacts from 
Desktop Applications
Most people maintain their contacts by using desktop applications — you 
know, Microsoft Outlook, IBM Lotus Notes, or Novell GroupWise. A word 
to the wise: You don’t want to maintain two address books. That’s a recipe 
for disaster. Luckily for you, RIM makes it easy to get your various address 
books — BlackBerry, desktop, laptop, whatever — in sync.

54
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
	
Your BlackBerry Storm comes with BlackBerry Desktop Manager, a collection 
of programs, one of which is Synchronize. Synchronize allows you to synchro­
nize the data between your device and the PC software. It also allows you to 
set up and configure the behavior of the program, including how the fields in 
the desktop version of Address Book map to Contacts fields in your 
BlackBerry.
Check out Chapter 15, which details using the Synchronize feature of the 
BlackBerry Desktop Manager application.
Looking for Someone?
Somehow — usually through typing and shuttling data between devices — 
you’ve created a nice long contacts list. Nice enough, we suppose — but useless 
unless you can find the phone number of Rufus T. Firefly at the drop of a hat.
That’s where the Find screen comes in. In fact, the first thing you see in 
Contacts when you open it is the Find screen, as shown in Figure 4-7.
	
Figure 4-7: 
Your search 
starts here.
	
You can conveniently search through your contacts by following these steps:
	
1.	In the Find field, enter the letters that start the name you’re 
searching for.
	
	 Your search criterion is the person’s name. You can enter the last name, 
first name, or both. The list is usually sorted by first name, last name. As 
you type the letters, the list shrinks based on matches. Figure 4-8 illus­
trates how this works.

55
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances
	
Figure 4-8: 
Enter more 
letters to 
shorten the 
potential 
contacts list 
search.
	
	
2.	Scroll and highlight the name from the list of matches.
	
	 If you have multiple matches, slide the screen to scroll through the list 
to find the person’s name.
	
3.	Press the menu key and touch-press one of the possible actions shown 
in Figure 4-9.
	
	 Here are the actions you can choose the menu items and what each one 
leads to:
 
• Activity Log: Opens a screen listing e-mails, calls, and SMS mes­
sages you’ve made to the contact.
 
• View Work Map: Appears only if you have filled in the work 
address information. This allows you to map the location using 
Maps.
 
• Email: Starts a new e-mail message. See Chapter 7 for more infor­
mation.
 
• PIN: Starts a new PIN-to-PIN message, which is a messaging feature 
unique to BlackBerry. With it, you can send a quick message to 
someone who has a BlackBerry. See Chapter 8 for more details 
about PIN-to-PIN messaging.
 
• Call: Uses Phone to dial the number.
 
• SMS: Starts a new SMS, or Short Message Service, message, which is 
used in cellphones. See Chapter 8 for more details about SMS.
 
• MMS: Starts a new MMS, or Multimedia Messaging Service, message. 
MMS is an evolution from SMS that supports voice and video clips. 
See Chapter 8 for details about MMS. The MMS item appears on 
the menu only if you have filled in the contact’s Mobile field.

56
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
 
• SIM Phone Book: Allows you to view contacts saved on the SIM 
card. This menu option is not in context with the selected contact.
 
• Send as Attachment: Starts a new e-mail message attaching the 
contacts. See Chapter 7 for more information.
 
• Forward to Messenger Contact: Allows you to add this contact to 
your contacts list in BlackBerry Messenger. This option appears 
only if BlackBerry Messenger is installed.
You can attach a contact, a security certificate, or a file. Those three choices 
are in the menu displayed after you press the menu key.
	
Figure 4-9: 
You get 
action 
options for 
the selected 
contact.
	
If you have a finger fumble and press a key in error, press the escape key 
once to return to the original list (the one showing all your contacts), or 
press the menu key and touch-press View All.
	
You’re not hallucinating: Sometimes Email <contact name> or Call <contact 
name> appears on the menu, and sometimes it doesn’t. Contacts knows when 
to show those menu options. If a contact has a phone number, Call <contact 
name> and SMS <contact name> show up, and the same is true for e-mail 
and the personal identification number (PIN). In fact, this list of actions is a 
convenient way to find out whether you have certain information — a phone 
number or an e-mail address — for a particular contact.
	
In a corporate environment, your BlackBerry Enterprise Server administrator 
might disable PIN-to-PIN messaging because it doesn’t go to the corporate 
e-mail servers and, therefore, can’t be monitored. If this is the case, the menu 
option PIN<contact name> won’t appear even though you entered PIN informa­
tion for your contacts. Note that you can still receive a PIN-to-PIN message, 
but you can’t send one.

57
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances
Organizing Your Contacts
You’ve been diligent by adding your contacts to the BlackBerry Contacts app, 
and your list has been growing at a pretty good clip. It now has all the con­
tact information for your business colleagues, clients, and (of course) family 
and friends. In fact, you now have hundreds of contacts, and it’s taking more 
time to find someone.
Imagine that you’ve just seen an old acquaintance, and you want to greet 
the person by name. You know that if you saw the name, you’d recognize it. 
The trouble is that your list has 300-plus names, which would take so long 
to scroll through that this acquaintance would surely come up to you in the 
meantime, forcing you to hide the fact that you can’t remember his name. 
(How embarrassing.) In this scenario, the tried-and-true Find feature wouldn’t 
be much help. What you need is a smaller pool of names to search through.
	
This isn’t rocket science. You’ll want to do one of the following or both:
	
✓	Organize your contacts into groups. Using groups (as every kinder­
garten teacher could tell you) is a way to arrange something (in your 
case, contacts) to make them more manageable. How you arrange your 
groups is up to you. You should base the principle on whatever makes 
sense to you and fits the group you set up. For example, you can place 
all your customer contacts within a Clients group and family members in 
a Family group.
	
✓	Set up your contacts so you can filter them. Use the Filter feature with 
BlackBerry’s Categories. (Categories is labeling your contacts to make it 
easy to filter them.) The Filter feature narrows the contacts list to such 
an extent that you have only to scroll down and find your contact — no 
need to type search keywords, in other words.
Whether you use the Group feature, Filter feature, or both is up to you. You 
find out how to use these methods in the next sections of this chapter.
Creating a group
A BlackBerry group in Contacts — as opposed to any other kind of group you 
can imagine — is just a simple category. In other words, when you create a 
group, you arrange your contacts into subsets without affecting the contact 
entries themselves. In Contacts itself, a group shows up in the contacts list 
just like any other contact. The only wrinkle here is that when you select the 
group, the contacts associated with that group — and only the contacts asso­
ciated with that group — appear onscreen.

58
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
Need some help visualizing how this works? Go ahead and create a group, fol­
lowing these steps:
	
1.	On the Home screen, touch-press the Contacts icon.
	
	 Contacts opens.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press New Group.
	
	 A screen similar to that in Figure 4-10 appears. The top portion of the 
screen is where you type the group name, and the bottom portion is 
where you add members.
	
Figure 4-10: 
An empty 
screen, 
ready for 
creating a 
group.
	
	
3.	Type the name of the group in the New Group field.
	
	 You can name it anything.
	
4.	Press the menu key and touch-press Add Member.
	
	 The main contacts list shows up in all its glory, ready to be pilfered.
	
5.	Touch-press the contact you want to add to your new Group list.
	
	 You can associate only a single piece of contact information from a 
member, either an e-mail address or a phone number. Why? Because 
a group is used as a distribution list, which means you simply add 
the group to the To, Cc, or Bcc field when you compose an e-mail or 
MMS. If you’re adding a member with more than one piece of contact 
information — say, an e-mail address and a phone number — you’ll be 
prompted to choose either of the two pieces of information.
	
6.	(Optional) Touch-press a phone number or an e-mail address.
	
	 If you simply want to group your contacts and not necessarily need to use 
it as a distribution list, you must follow a rule. The contact needs to have 
at least an e-mail address or a phone number before you can add it as a 
member of a group. (Contacts is strict on this point.) Skirt this roadblock 

59
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances
by editing that contact’s information and putting in a fake (and clearly 
inactive) e-mail address, such as notareal@emailaddress.no.
	
7.	Press the menu key and touch-press Continue.
	
	 The name you just entered appears in your group list, as shown in 
Figure 4-11.
	
Figure 4-11: 
Your new 
group 
has one 
member.
	
	
8.	Repeat Step 4 to add more friends to your list.
	
9.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save Group.
	
	 Your group is duly saved, and you can now see it listed on your main 
contacts list.
	
Groups is a valuable tool for creating an e-mail distribution list. When adding 
members to the group, make sure that you select an e-mail address field for 
your members instead of a phone number. Use a naming convention to easily 
distinguish your group in the list. Appending -DL or -Distribution List to the 
group name can quickly indicate that it is a distribution list.
Using the Filter feature on your contacts
Are you a left-brainer or a right-brainer? Yankees fan or Red Sox fan? Innie 
or outie? Dividing the world into categories is something everyone does (no 
divisions there), so it should come as no surprise that BlackBerry divides 
your contacts into distinct categories as well.
By default, two categories are set for you on the BlackBerry:
	
✓	Business
	
✓	Personal

60
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
Why stop at two? BlackBerry makes it easy to create more categories. In this 
section, you first find out how to categorize a contact; then you see how to 
filter your contacts list. Finally, you find out how to create categories.
Categorizing your contacts
Whether you’re creating or editing a contact, you can categorize a particular 
contact as long as you’re in Edit mode.
If the trick is getting into Edit mode, it’s a pretty simple trick. Here’s how to 
do that:
	
1.	On the Home screen, touch-press the Contacts icon.
	
	 Contacts opens.
	
2.	Highlight the contact.
	
3.	Press the menu key and touch-press Edit.
	
	 Contacts is in Edit mode for this particular contact, which is exactly 
where you want to be.
	
4.	Press the menu key and touch-press Categories.
	
	 A Categories list appears. By default, the list contains only the Business 
and Personal categories.
	
5.	Touch-press the Personal check box.
	
6.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
	
	 You’re back at the Edit screen for this contact.
	
7.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
You now have one — count ’em, one — contact with Personal as its 
category, which means you can filter your contacts list by using a category. 
Here’s how:
	
1.	On the Home screen, touch-press the Contacts icon.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Filter.
	
	 Your Categories list appears. If you haven’t added any categories in the 
meantime, you see only the default Business and Personal categories.
	
3.	Touch-press the Personal check box.
	
	 A mark appears in the check box, and your contacts list shrinks to the 
contacts in the Personal category, as shown in Figure 4-12.
	
As you add contacts to a category, you can use Find. Enter the first few letters of 
the name to further narrow the contact search. If you need a refresher on how 
Find works, see the “Looking for Someone?” section, earlier in this chapter.

61
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances

tacts list

apply a

Adding a category
Whoever thought the default categories — Business and Personal — were 
enough for the complexities of the real world probably didn’t know many 
people. BlackBerry makes it easy to add categories, so you can divide your 
world as much as you like:
	
1.	On the Home screen, touch-press Contacts.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Filter.
	
	 You get a view of the default categories (Business and Personal).
	
3.	Press the menu key and touch-press New.
	
	 A pop-up screen asks you to name the category.
	
4.	Type a name for your category in the Name field.
	
5.	Touch-press Enter (bottom rightmost key on the virtual keyboard).
	
	 The category is automatically saved. The Filter screen lists all the cat­
egories, including the one you just created.
	
6.	Press the escape key to get back to the Contacts main screen.
Setting preferences
Vanilla, anyone? Some days you’ll wish that your contacts list were sorted 
differently. For example, there’s the day when you need to find the guy who 
works for ABC Company but has a foreign name that you can hardly pro­
nounce, let alone spell. What’s a body to do?
You’re in luck. Contacts Options, shown in Figure 4-13, navigates some out-
of-the-ordinary situations. To get to the Contacts Options screen, touch-
press Contacts from the Home screen, press the menu key, and touch-press 

62
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
Options. Despite the Contacts Options screen’s simplicity, it provides you 
with three important options that change the behavior of Contacts:
	
✓	Sort By: Changes the way the list is sorted. You can use First Name, 
Last Name, or Company. Touch-press the field to view and select one of 
the possible choices. Remember that guy from ABC Company? You can 
use the Sort By option to sort by Company. Then all contacts from ABC 
Company would be listed next to one another, and with any luck, the 
guy’s name will jump out at you. Choices you have are First Name (the 
default), Last Name and Company.
	
✓	Separators: Allows you to change the dividers on the contacts list. It’s 
purely aesthetics, but check it out; you might like the stripes.
	
✓	Allow Duplicate Names: Self-explanatory. If you turn this on, you can 
have multiple people in your Contacts who happen to have the same 
name. If you disable this option, you get a warning when you try to add a 
name that matches one already on your list. Maybe you’re just tired and 
mistakenly try to add the same person twice to your list. Then again, 
sometimes people just have the same name. We recommend keeping the 
default value of Yes, allowing you to have contacts with the same names.
	
✓	Confirm Delete: Displays a confirmation screen for all contact deletions.
	
	Always keep this feature turned on for normal usage. Because there are 
many ways you could delete someone from your contacts, this feature is 
a good way of minimizing accidents.

Sharing a Contact
Suppose that you want to share your contact information with a friend who 
also has a BlackBerry. A vCard — virtual (business) card — is your answer 

63
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances
and can make your life a lot easier. In BlackBerry Land, a vCard is a contact in 
your contacts that you send to someone as an attachment to an e-mail.
At the receiving end, the BlackBerry (being the smart device that it is) rec­
ognizes the attachment and informs the BlackBerry owner that she has the 
option of saving it, making it available for her viewing pleasure in Contacts.
Sending a vCard
Because a vCard is nothing more than a Contacts contact attached to an 
e-mail, sending a vCard is a piece of cake. (Of course, you do need to make 
sure that your recipient has a BlackBerry device to receive the information.)
Here’s how you go about sending a vCard:
	
1.	On the Home screen, touch-press the Messages icon.
	
	 Messages opens.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Compose Email.
	
	 The new message screen appears, allowing you to compose a new 
e-mail.
	
3.	In the To field, start typing the name of the person you want to 
receive this vCard.
	
4.	When you see the name in the drop-down list, touch-press it.
	
	 You see an e-mail screen with the name you just selected as the To 
recipient.
	
5.	Type the subject and message.
	
6.	Press the menu key and touch-press Attach Contact.
	
	 Contacts opens.
	
7.	Touch-press the name of the person whose contact information you 
want attached.
	
	 The e-mail composition screen reappears, and an icon that looks like a 
book indicates that the e-mail now contains your attachment. Now all 
you have to do is send your e-mail.
	
8.	Press the menu key and touch-press Send.
	
	 You just shared the specified contact information. (Don’t you feel right 
neighborly now?)

64
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
Receiving a vCard
If you get an e-mail that has a contact attachment, here’s how to save it to 
your contacts:
	
1.	On the Home screen, touch-press the Messages icon.
	
2.	Touch-press the e-mail that contains the vCard.
	
	 The e-mail with the vCard attachment opens.
	
3.	Touch-press the attachment.
	
4.	Press the menu key and touch-press View Attachment.
	
	 The vCard appears.
	
5.	Press the menu key and touch-press Add to Contacts.
	
	 The vCard is saved and is available in your BlackBerry Storm Contacts.
Searching for Someone 
Outside Your Contacts
Does your employer provide your BlackBerry Storm? Do you use Outlook or 
Lotus Notes on your desktop machine at work? If you answer yes to both of 
these questions, this section is for you.
BlackBerry Contacts allows you to search for people in your organization, 
basically through this software:
	
✓	Microsoft Exchange (for Outlook)
	
✓	IBM Domino (for Notes)
	
✓	Novell GroupWise
Exchange, Domino, and GroupWise serve the same purposes: namely, to 
facilitate e-mail delivery in a corporate environment and to enable access to a 
database of names.
	
For you techies out there, these databases are called Global Address Lists 
(GAL) in Exchange, Notes Address Books in Domino, and GroupWise Address 
Books in GroupWise.
If you want to search for someone in your organization through a database of 
names, simply follow these steps:
	
1.	On the Home screen, touch-press the Contacts icon.

65
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Lookup.
	
	 Some corporations might not enable the Lookup feature. Please check 
with your IT department for more information.
	
3.	Type the name you’re searching for.
	
4.	Press the enter key.
	
	 You could enter the beginning characters of either a person’s last or 
first name. You aren’t searching your contacts but your company’s data­
base, so this step might take some time.
	
	 For big organizations, we recommend being more precise when search­
ing. For example, searching for Daniel yields fewer hits than searching 
for Danl. The more precise your search criteria, the fewer hits you’ll get 
and the faster the search will be.
	
	 While the search is in progress, you see the word Lookup and the cri­
teria you put in. For example, if you enter Daniel, the top row reads 
Lookup: Daniel. After the search is finished, BlackBerry displays the 
number of hits or matches — for example, 20 matches: Daniel.
	
5.	Touch-press the matches count.
	
	 The matches appear. A header at the top of this screen details the 
matches displayed in the current screen as well as the total hits. For 
example, if the header reads Lookup Daniel (20 of 130 matches), 130 
people in your organization have the name Daniel, and BlackBerry is 
displaying the first 20. You have the option of fetching more by pressing 
the menu key and touching Get More Results on the menu that appears.
	
	 You can add the listed name(s) to your contacts list by using the Add 
command (for the currently highlighted name) or the Add All command 
for all the names on the list. (As always, press the menu key.)
	
6.	Touch-press the person whose information you want to review.
	
	The person’s contact information is displayed on a read-only screen, 
which means you can read it but not change it. You might see the per­
son’s title, e-mail address, work number, mobile number, fax number, and 
street address at work. Any of that information gives you confirmation 
about the person you’re looking for. Of course, what shows up depends 
on the availability of this information in your company’s database.
Synchronizing Facebook Contacts
Do you network like a social butterfly? You must be using one of the popular 
social networking applications, such as MySpace or Facebook. You must 
have tons of friends from these networking sites and want to copy their con­
tact information to your Storm. Individual networking sites may or may not 

66
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
have a way of copying contacts to and from your BlackBerry. But if you’re in 
Facebook, you’re in luck.
With the latest Facebook application (version 1.6 as of this writing), it’s much 
easier to get Facebook contacts into your Storm. The Facebook app also 
allows you to synchronize information between your Storm and your friend’s 
information in Facebook.
Adding a Facebook friend info to Contacts
Pulling down your friend’s information from Facebook to your contacts list is 
quite easy:
	
1.	Touch-press the Facebook icon from the Home screen.
	
	 The Facebook application is filed under the Downloads folder.
	
2.	Touch-press the Friends icon, which is at the top of the screen.
	
	 Your friends list appears, similar to the one on the left in Figure 4-14.
	
3.	In the Find field, start typing your friend’s name.
	
	 This narrows the list, as shown on the right in Figure 4-14.
	
Figure 4-14: 
Select 
Facebook 
friends 
to add to 
Contacts.
	
	
4.	Highlight the friend you want to add to Contacts, press the menu key, 
and touch-press Connect to BlackBerry Contact.
	
	 A dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-15, allowing you to choose 
whether to connect this Facebook friend to an existing contact or add 
the friend as a new contact to your Storm. In this case, you want to add.
	
	 If the same person exists in Storm and Facebook, you can simply link the 
contact here. Also, see the next section, “Automatic syncing between 
Facebook profiles and Contacts,” to get an automatic update on your 
BlackBerry whenever your friend changes his or her profile in Facebook.

67
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances
	
Figure 4-15: 
Connect a 
Facebook 
friend to 
an existing 
contact or 
add a new 
contact.
	
	
	 The term connect in Facebook means telling the app which contact is 
associated with a Facebook friend. Once the app records this linkage, it 
knows which contact to update when information in Facebook changes.
	
5.	Touch-press New Contact.
	
	 A progress screen appears momentarily, telling you that it’s getting the 
contact information from Facebook. When the process is finished, a new 
contact is added to your Storm, and the contact info appears on the screen.
	
6.	Press the escape key.
	
	 The Facebook app displays a prompt, asking you whether to ask for a 
phone number. This is a default behavior even if the phone number is 
already in your BlackBerry.
	
7.	Touch-press Yes or No to the prompt requesting a phone number.
	
	 You’re back to the previous Facebook screen, where an Address Book 
icon has been added to the right of your friend’s name to indicate that 
this friend is now connected, or linked, to a BlackBerry contact.
Automatic syncing between Facebook 
profiles and Contacts
When running the Facebook application for the first time, you’re asked to 
enable synchronization. You can choose among the following Facebook and 
BlackBerry connections:
	
✓	BlackBerry Calendar application: When this option is enabled, a cal­
endar item is automatically created in your Storm whenever you have a 
new Facebook event.
	
✓	BlackBerry Message application: When this option is enabled, you’ll see 
new Facebook notifications in your Messages application.

68
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
	
✓	BlackBerry Contacts application: When this option is enabled, your 
Storm contacts are periodically updated with the latest Facebook infor­
mation, including the profile pictures. Your Storm contacts also will be 
sent to Facebook.
If you opted out of these options the first time you ran Facebook, you can still 
enable them from the Facebook Options screen. The following steps enable 
Contacts synchronization:
	
1.	Touch-press the Facebook icon from the Home screen.
	
	 The Facebook application is filed under the Downloads folder.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then touch-press Options.
	
	 The Options screen appears, with lots of information, so you have to 
scroll down to see all the options. Feel free to check other options, but 
for synchronizing contacts, refer to the first two pages of the screen, 
which look like the one shown in Figure 4-16.
	
Figure 4-16: 
Synchronize 
Facebook 
friends.
	
	
3.	Touch-press the BlackBerry Contacts application check box.
	
	 If you scroll down, you see another check box (Figure 4-16, right), 
which allows you to synchronize Facebook profile photos with Contacts 
photos.
	
4.	Touch-press the check box titled Update Existing Photos in Your 
BlackBerry Contacts List with Facebook Friend Profile Photos.
	
5.	Press the escape key and touch-press Yes on the Save Changes 
prompt.
	
	 Your contacts will now be periodically updated with Facebook friends.

T
o some folks, the key to being organized and productive is mastering time 
management (and we’re not just talking about reading this book while 
you’re commuting to work). Many know that the best way to organize their 
time is to use a calendar — a daily planner tool. Those who prefer digital to 
paper use a planner program on their PC — either installed on their hard 
drive or accessed through an Internet portal (such as Yahoo!). The smartest 
of the bunch, of course, use their BlackBerry Storm because it has the whole 
planner thing covered with its Calendar.
In this chapter, we show you how to keep your life (both personal and work) 
in order by managing your appointments with your BlackBerry Calendar. 
What’s great about managing your time on a BlackBerry Storm? Your Storm 
is always with you.
Just remember that you won’t have excuses anymore for forgetting that 
important quarterly meeting or Bertha’s birthday bash.
Accessing BlackBerry Calendar
BlackBerry Calendar is one of the BlackBerry Storm’s core applications, such 
as Contacts or Phone (read more about the others in Chapter 1), so it’s easy 
to get to. From the Home screen, press the menu key and touch-press the 
Calendar icon onscreen. Voilà! You have Calendar, as shown in Figure 5-1.

Figure 5-1: 
Day view in 
Calendar.
	
Choosing Your Calendar View
The first time you open Calendar, Day view appears by default (refer to 
Figure 5-1). However, you can change the Calendar view to one that works 
better for your needs:
	
✓	Day: A summary of your appointments for the day. By default, it lists all 
your appointments from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
	
✓	Week: This view shows you a seven-day summary view of your appoint­
ments. By using this view, you can see how busy you are in a particular 
week.
	
✓	Month: The Month view shows you every day of the month. You can’t 
tell how many appointments have in a day, but you can see on which 
days you have appointments.
	
✓	Agenda: The Agenda view isn’t a time-based view like the others. It lists 
your upcoming appointments, including details of the appointments, 
such as where and when.
Different views (like the month view shown in Figure 5-2) offer a different 
focus on your schedule. Select the view you want based on your scheduling 
needs and preferences. If your life is a little more complicated, you can even 
use a combination of views for a full grasp of your schedule.

Switching Calendar views
To switch between Calendar views, simply follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Home screen, touch-press the Calendar icon.
	
	 The Calendar application is called up in its default Day view (more than 
likely).
	
2.	Press the menu key and then touch-press the view of your choice on 
the menu that appears.
	
	 If you start from Month view, your choices are View Day, View Week, 
and View Agenda (see Figure 5-3).
Moving between time frames
Depending on what Calendar view you’re in, you can easily move to the pre­
vious or next day, week, month, or year. For example, if you’re looking at 
September in Month view, you can move to August or October See Figure 5-4.

Without using the menu, you can quickly move to the next “page.” The 
bottom-right corner of the screen has back and forward arrows; try them in 
each time frame view (Day view, Week view, Month view). Moreover, without 
touch-pressing any key, you can finger-flick between timeframes. For exam­
ple, in Month view, you can flip to the next day with a finger-flick.
You have similar flexibility when it comes to the other Calendar views. See 
Table 5-1 for a summary of what’s available.

You might have multiple calendars, just as you might have several e-mail 
accounts. Do you have multiple calendars? How can you have multiple cal­
endars? It’s easy: For each e-mail that you “hook” into your BlackBerry (see 
Chapter 7), your BlackBerry automatically adds a new calendar. Why is 
having multiple calendars useful? Consider this example: You might have a 
calendar from your day job and a calendar from your personal life or a soft­
ball club that you belong to. Whatever the reason, your BlackBerry Storm has 
a great way for you to manage this.
You can assign different color squares to represent different calendars. This 
color-coding gives you a better view of which event belongs to which calen­
dar, as shown in Figure 5-6. For example, you can have your day job calendar 
as red and your softball club calendar as green. When two events conflict, the 
color helps you see the conflict and prioritize. (It’s okay to admit that it’s all 
about your softball club!)

Follow these steps to change the color of each calendar:
	
1.	Open Calendar.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Options.
	
	 You see a list of calendars here, in addition to a few options.
 	
3.	Touch-press a calendar of your choice.
	
	The Calendar Properties screen opens.

4.	Touch-press the colored square and then touch-press the desired 
color.
	
5.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
All Things Appointment: Adding, 
Opening, and Deleting
After you master the different Calendar views (and that should take you all of 
about two minutes), and you have Calendar customized to your heart’s con­
tent (another three minutes, tops), it’s time (pun intended) to set up, review, 
and delete appointments. We also show you how to set up a meeting with 
clients or colleagues.
Creating an appointment
Setting up a new appointment is easy. You need only one piece of informa­
tion: when your appointment occurs. Of course, you can easily add related 
information about the appointment:
	
✓	The meeting’s purpose
	
✓	The location
	
✓	Additional notes
	
In addition to your standard, one-time, limited-duration meeting, you can 
set all-day appointments. The BlackBerry can assist you in setting recurring 
(repeating) meetings as well as reminders. Sweet!
Creating a one-time appointment
To add a new one-time appointment, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open Calendar.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press New.
	
	 The New Appointment screen appears, as shown in Figure 5-7.
	
	 You can also touch-press the bottom-left icon with a plus sign to open 
the New Appointment screen.

77
 Chapter 5: Keeping Your Appointments
	
Figure 5-7: 
Set an 
appointment 
here.
	
	
3.	Fill in the appointment information.
	
	 Type the information regarding your appointment in the appropri­
ate spaces. You should at least enter the time and the subject of your 
appointment.
	
4.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
	
	Your appointment is now available from any Calendar view.
	
You can have more than one appointment in the same time slot. BlackBerry 
lets you decide which appointment you should go for and which one you con­
veniently forget.
Creating an all-day appointment
If your appointment is an all-day event — you’re in corporate training or have 
an all-day doctor’s appointment — touch-press the All Day Event check box 
in the New Appointment screen.
Setting your appointment reminder time
You can associate any Calendar appointment with a reminder alert  either a 
vibration or a beep, depending on how you set things up in your profile. (For 
more on profiles, see Chapter 3.) You can have no reminder for an appointment.
Create a reminder this way: From the New Appointment screen, simply scroll 
to the Reminder field and select a reminder time anywhere from none to 1 
week before your appointment time.

78
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
	
Profile is simply another useful feature that allows you to customize how your 
BlackBerry alerts you when an event occurs. Examples of events are an e-mail, 
a phone call, or an appointment reminder.
By default, whatever reminder alert you set goes off 15 minutes before the 
event. But you don’t have to stick with the default. You can choose your own 
default reminder time:
	
1.	Open Calendar.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Options.
	
	 A few Calendar options appear, along with a list of calendars.
	
3.	Touch-press General Options and then touch-press Default Reminder.
	
4.	Touch-press a default reminder time anywhere from none to 1 week 
before your appointment.
	
	 From now on, any new appointment has the reminder you set up. 
Assuming a reminder time other than none (you’re on your own, then!), 
a dialog box like the one in Figure 5-8 appears, letting you know that an 
appointment is coming up.
	
Figure 5-8: 
You get a 
reminder 
dialog box if 
you want.
	
Creating a recurring appointment
Everyone has some repeating appointments: birthdays, anniversaries, taking 
out the trash every Thursday at 7:30 a.m. You can set up recurring appoint­
ments based on daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly recurrences.

79
 Chapter 5: Keeping Your Appointments
You can define an Every field for all types. Say you have an appointment that 
recurs every nine days. Set the Recurrence field to Daily, and set the Every 
field to 9 (see Figure 5-9).
	
Figure 5-9: 
An 
appointment 
recurring 
every nine 
days.
	
Depending on what you select in the Recurrence field, you have the option to 
fill in other fields:
	
✓	Weekly: You can fill in the Day of the Week field.
	
✓	Monthly or Yearly: The Relative Date check box is available. With 
this checked, you can ensure that your appointment recurs relative to 
today’s date. For example, if you choose the following, your appoint­
ment occurs every two months on the third Sunday until July 31, 2012:
Start: Sunday, June 17, 2010 at 12 p.m.
End: Sunday, June 17, 2010 at 1 p.m.
Recurrence: Monthly
Every: 2
Relative Date: Selected
End: Saturday, July 31, 2012
On the other hand, if all options in our example remain the same but you don’t 
select Relative Date, your appointment occurs every two months, on the 18th 
of the month, until July 31, 2012. If all this “relative” talk has you dizzy, don’t 
worry: Most of your appointments won’t be as complicated as this.

80
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
Understanding Appointments 
versus Meetings
Technically, any event is an appointment, whether it’s your friend’s birthday 
or a doctor’s appointment. However, when you invite people or are invited to 
a meeting (face-to-face or via phone), that appointment becomes a meeting.
Sending a meeting request
Sending a meeting request to others is similar to creating a Calendar 
appointment:
	
1.	Open Calendar.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then touch-press New.
	
3.	Fill in the key appointment information.
	
4.	Press the menu key and touch-press Invite Attendee.
	
	 You’re taken to Address Book to select your meeting attendee.
	
5.	From Address Book:
	
• If you have contacts in your Address Book: Touch-press the 
contact you want to invite.
 
• If you don’t yet have contacts or the one you want isn’t in your 
Address Book: Choose the Use Once option to type the appropri­
ate e-mail address in Calendar.
	
	 You see the attendees in your Calendar meeting notice.
	
6.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
	
	 Your meeting attendees receive an e-mail inviting them to your meeting.
Responding to a meeting request
You’ve likely received a meeting request by e-mail, whether for work or for a 
casual event. (If it’s from your boss for an all-staff meeting, and it’s close to 
bonus time, that’s an Accept.)
You can accept any meeting request from your managers or colleagues on 
your BlackBerry just as you would on your desktop PC. Upon reading the 

81
 Chapter 5: Keeping Your Appointments
e-mail on your BlackBerry, choose one of the following in the Messages appli­
cation: Accept, Tentative, or Decline.
Your response is sent in an e-mail. We go into more detail about the 
Messages application in Chapter 8.
If you choose Accept or Tentative, the meeting is added to your calendar 
automatically. If you have a change of heart and want to delete the event, go 
back to the calendar event, press the menu key, and touch-press Delete from 
the menu.
	
Do you use Google to manage your Calendar and contacts on the Web? Then 
Google Sync for BlackBerry is what you need! You can download it by visit­
ing http://m.google.com/sync from your BlackBerry’s Browser. Google 
offers a variety of other applications for BlackBerry users, including Google 
Maps; Google Voice; Google Search App;   and the newly released Enhanced 
Gmail plug-in, which adds more Gmail functionality to the native BlackBerry 
e-mail client. The BlackBerry native e-mail client is e-mail that comes with 
your carrier and ends with blackberry.com or blackberry.net. For Verizon, the 
native BlackBerry e-mail is username@vzw.blackberry.net.
Setting your meeting dial-in number
In this global economy, many of us have colleagues and friends who are 
located in another country or even on another continent. So many meetings 
are through a phone conference that involves a dial-in number, a moderator 
code (if you are the moderator), and a participation code. Your BlackBerry 
Storm makes storing and displaying these numbers easy when you’re creat­
ing a new appointment in Calendar.
To set your phone conference dial-in details, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open Calendar.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Options.
	
3.	Touch-press Conference Call Options.
	
	A screen similar to Figure 5-10 appears.
	
4.	Enter the appropriate numbers.
	
5.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
The next time you create a new appointment with a conference call, the 
conference number shows up.

▶	Setting the BlackBerry timer
▶	Making your life easier with Password Keeper
I
n this chapter, we introduce you to the Clock application, which not only 
tells you the time, but also allows you to set alarms and a timer. In addition, 
you can use the application as a stopwatch. And in keeping with one of the key 
themes of this book — making your life easier — the Clock app has a feature 
called Bedside mode that turns your Storm into a quiet bedside companion.
To continue with the theme of making your life a little easier, we make sure 
that you get the scoop on keeping your passwords in a single location safely 
by using the Password Keeper application.
Accessing Clock
Clock can be found on the Home screen, as you can see on the left side of 
Figure 6-1. Just look for the icon of an alarm clock. After you find the Clock 
icon, simply touch-press it, and you see a screen similar to the one on the 
right side of Figure 6-1.

84
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm

and view 
your clock 
(right).
	
	
If you’ve changed themes, different icons might be displayed (refer to 
Chapter 3 for more on themes). Just remember that the Clock application 
is always located on the Home screen.
Customizing Your Clock
If the default analog clock doesn’t fit your taste, you can change it. 
Customizing your clock is easy and doesn’t take much time.
You customize the clock in the Options screen. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Touch-press Clock from the Home screen.
	
	 The Clock application opens.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Options.
	
	 The Clock Options screen appears, as shown in Figure 6-2, ready and 
willing to be customized. We discuss every customization field you see 
on these screens following the steps.
	
3.	Move to each field and choose the option you want.
	
	 Each of these fields is described shortly.
	
4.	Press the escape key and then touch-press Save from the prompt.

85

Figure 6-2: 
Customize 
your clock 
here.
	
The Clock Options screen is divided into five sections, as follows:
	
✓	Clock section: This is where you choose the type of clock, time zone, 
time, and whether to show the clock when charging.
	
• Clock Face: Set the type of clock. The options are Analog (the 
default; refer to the right side of Figure 6-1), Digital, Flip Clock, and 
LCD Digital. Digital looks like the clock shown on the left side of 
Figure 6-3, and Flip Clock is shown on the right side of Figure 6-3.
	
• Home Time Zone: Select your time zone from the list.
 
• When Charging: Control the behavior of the clock when you con­
nect your Storm to the charger. Possible choices are Do Nothing, 
Display Clock (the default), and Enter Bedside Mode.
 
• Set Time: Click this button, and you see a Date/Time screen that 
displays the current time in edit mode, allowing you to change the 
time. You can also change the time zone as well as synchronize 
your BlackBerry’s time to the network carriers’ time.
	
✓	Alarm section: Navigate here if you want to customize the behavior of 
the alarm.
	
•	Alarm Tune: Choose from a list of ring tones you want to play. This 
setting applies only if you have Tone or Tone + Vibrate selected for 
the Alert Type. The default tone is Alarm_Antelope.

86
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
 
• Snooze Time: Just like with your ordinary alarm clock, you have 
the option to hit the snooze. You can choose 30, 15, 10, 5 (the 
default), 1 minute, or None.
 
• Volume: You can set the volume of the tone to Silent, 1 to 10 (the 
default is 8), or Escalating.
 
• Vibration: You can enable or disable vibration. Choose Off, On (the 
default), or Custom. If you choose Custom, two new fields appear. 
The first, Length, enables you to choose the duration of the vibra­
tion: Short, Medium (the default), or Long. The second field, Count, 
vibrates your Storm as your alarm. Choices are 1, 2 (the default), 3, 
5, and 10 repetitions.
	
Figure 6-3: 
Digital (left) 
and Flip

✓	Bedside Mode section: This section allows you to set the behavior of 
your Storm when it is in Bedside mode.
	
• Disable LED: Allows you to disable LED notifications during 
Bedside mode. Choices are Yes (the default) and No.
 
• Disable Radio: Allows you to disable the radio during Bedside 
mode. Choices are Yes and No (the default).
	
	Disabling the radio means that all communication-related 
applications — such as e-mail, SMS, BlackBerry Messenger, instant 
messaging clients, and Phone — cannot receive incoming signals.

87
 Chapter 6: Setting Alarms and Keeping Your Passwords
 
• Dim Screen: Choose Yes (the default) or No to control the dimming 
of the screen in Bedside mode.
	
• Sound Profile: Use for anything that requires sound notification. 
You have several profiles to choose among: Active Profile (the 
default), Normal, Loud, Medium, Vibrate Only, Silent, Phone Calls 
Only, and All Alerts Off. Remember that you can always add a 
custom profile (see Chapter 3 for details).
	
✓	Stopwatch section: A section to change the face of the stopwatch.
	
•	Stopwatch Face: Choose between an Analog (the default) or a 
Digital stopwatch.
	
✓	Countdown Timer section: Navigate here if you want to customize the 
behavior of the timer.
	
•	Timer Face: Your choices are Analog (the default) and Digital.
 
• Timer Tune: Choose the ring tone you want to play when the timer 
reaches the time you set.
 
• Volume: You can select Mute or set the volume of the tone to Low, 
Medium, High, or Escalating. Escalating means that the tone starts 
Low and gradually goes to High. The default is Medium.
 
• Vibration: Choose Yes if you want Storm to vibrate when the timer 
reaches the time set; otherwise, choose No (the default).
Setting a Wake-Up Alarm
The Clock application is also your bedside alarm clock. You can set it to wake 
you up once or on a regular basis.
Here’s how you tell your wake-up buddy to do the work for you:
	
1.	Touch-press Clock from the Home screen.
	
	 The Clock appears.
	
2.	Touch-press anywhere on the screen and then touch-press Set Alarm.
	
	 A time field appears in the middle of the screen, as shown in Figure 6-4. 
The time defaults to the previous set alarm time or, if you haven’t used 
the alarm before, the current time. If the default time isn’t your intended 
alarm time, proceed to Step 3 to change the time.

Figure 6-4: 
Set your 
alarm time 
here.
	
	
3.	Tap the specific portion of the time that you want to change, and slide 
up or down to choose one of the possible values.
	
	 Any highlighted portion of the time is editable. You can change the 
hours; minutes; AM/PM; and whether the alarm is ON, OFF, or only 
WEEKD (weekdays). Setting a value doesn’t create an entry in Calendar 
or Tasks. Finger-scroll up or down to choose a possible value.
	
4.	Touch-press the OK button to accept all your changes.
Setting and Exiting Bedside Mode
You can use a setting in the Clock application called Bedside mode to mini­
mize disturbances by your Storm. With Bedside mode, you can dim the 
screen, disable the LED, and even turn off the radio, all of which pretty much 
make your Storm behave like a brick. Bear in mind that when you turn off the 
radio, you won’t get incoming phone calls or any type of messaging. If you 
want a refresher on how to set these options, see “Customizing Your Clock,” 
previously in this chapter.
To set your BlackBerry Storm in Bedside mode:
	
1.	Touch-press Clock from the Home screen.
	
2.	Touch-press anywhere on the screen and then touch-press Enter 
Bedside Mode (Figure 6-5, left).
	
	 That’s it. Your Storm should now behave like a good bedside companion.

• Lap and Reset button: The image on this button looks like a cir­
cular arrow initially. After you start the stopwatch, this button 
becomes a lap button, and the image changes to a connected 
arrow with an oval shape. This Lap button is useful when some­
one is doing laps in a swimming pool or on a track field and you 
want to record how long each lap takes. Touch-press the button to 
record the completion of a single lap. The lap and the lap time will 
be listed on the screen. A lap is labeled as Lap 1 for the first lap, 
Lap 2 for the second lap, and so on.
	
3.	To start the stopwatch, touch-press the Stopwatch button.
	
4.	To stop the stopwatch, touch-press the Stopwatch button again.
	
Figure 6-6:

Using Timer
Have you overcooked something? Not if you have a good timer to warn you:
	
1.	Touch-press Clock from the Home screen.
	
2.	Touch-Press anywhere on the screen and then touch-press Timer.
	
	 A screen similar to the left side of Figure 6-7 appears. The left button 
with the stopwatch image is the start and pause button. You can use the 
right button with the circular arrow image to stop and reset the timer. 
The default time for your timer is based on what you set earlier. If you 
haven’t set a time or you want to set a new time, proceed to the next 
step.

both. To do so, touch-press Clock from the Home screen. Press the menu key 
and then touch-press Options. In the Countdown Timer section, make your 
selections.
Using Password Keeper
Suppose that you’re in front of an Internet browser, trying to access an online 
account. For the life of you, you just can’t remember the account password. 
It’s your third login attempt, and if you fail this time, your account will be 
locked. Then you have to call the customer hotline and wait hours before 
you can speak to a representative. Argghh! It’s happened to all of us. Luckily, 
BlackBerry Storm gives you an application to avoid this headache.

92
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
Password Keeper is the simple yet practical BlackBerry Storm applica­
tion that makes your life that much easier. Password Keeper is filed in 
Applications (as shown in Figure 6-8).
Setting a password for Password Keeper
	
The first time you access Password Keeper, you’re prompted to enter a 
password. Be sure to remember the password you choose, because this is the 
password to all your passwords. Forgetting this password is like forgetting the 
combination of your safe. There is no way to retrieve a forgotten Password 
Keeper password. You are prompted to enter this master password every 
time you access the application.
Trust us: One password is much easier to remember than many passwords.
	
You can enter any characters or numbers as your password, and there is no 
length requirement as long as you enter something. However, we recommend 
that you choose a password combining letters and numbers.
	
Figure 6-8: 
Password 
Keeper

Applications 
folder.
	
Creating credentials
Okay, so you’re ready to fire up your handy-dandy Password Keeper appli­
cation. Now what kinds of things does it expect you to do for it to work its 
magic? Obviously, you’ll need to collect the pertinent info for all your various 
password-protected accounts so that you can store them in the protected 

93
 Chapter 6: Setting Alarms and Keeping Your Passwords
environs of Password Keeper. So when creating a new password entry, be 
sure you have the following information (see Figure 6-9):
	
✓	Title: This one’s straightforward. Just come up with a name to describe the 
password-protected account — My Favorite Shopping Site, for example.
	
✓	Username: This is where you enter the username for the account.
	
✓	Password: Enter the password for the account here.
	
✓	Website: Put the Web site address (its URL) here.
	
✓	Notes: Not exactly crucial, but the Notes field does give you a bit of 
room to add a comment or two.
	
Figure 6-9: 
Set your 
password 
here.
	
	
The only required field is Title, but a title alone usually isn’t much use to you. 
We suggest that you fill in as much other information here as possible, but at 
the same time, be discreet about those locations where you use your username 
and password — so don’t put anything in the Website field or use My eBay 
Account as a title. That way, in the unlikely case that someone gains access to 
your password to Password Keeper, the intruder will have a hard time figuring 
out where exactly to use your credentials.
Generating passwords randomly
If you’re the kind of person who uses one password for everything but knows 
deep in your heart that this is just plain wrong, wrong, wrong, random pass­
word generation is for you. When creating a new password for yet another 

94
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
online account (or when changing your password for an online account you 
already have), fire up Password Keeper, press the menu key, touch-press 
New, press the menu key, and then touch-press Random Password, as shown 
in Figure 6-10. Voilà! A new password is automatically generated for you.
	
Figure 6-10: 
Generate 
a random 
password.
	
	
Using random password generation makes sense in conjunction with 
Password Keeper because you don’t have to remember the randomly gener­
ated password that Password Keeper came up with for any of your online 
accounts; that’s Password Keeper’s job.
Using your password
The whole point of Password Keeper is to let your BlackBerry Storm’s 
electronic brain do your password remembering for you. Imagine this sce­
nario: You can no longer live without owning a copy of the CD A Chipmunk 
Christmas, so you surf over to your favorite online music store and attempt to 
log in. You draw a blank on your password, but instead of seething, you take 
out your Storm, open Password Keeper, and do a find.
Type the first letters of your account title in the Find field to search for the 
title of your password. After you find the title, simply touch-press it, and the 
screen for your account appears, conveniently listing the password. All you 
have to do now is enter the password in the login screen for the online music 
store, and Alvin, Simon, and Theodore will soon be wending their way to your 
address, ready to sing “Chipmunk Jingle Bells.”

95
 Chapter 6: Setting Alarms and Keeping Your Passwords
	
Yes, you can copy-and-paste your password from Password Keeper to another 
application — BlackBerry Browser, for instance. Just tap the entry from the 
Password Keeper list, press the menu key, and touch-press Copy Password on 
the menu that appears. Then navigate to where you want to enter the pass­
word, press the menu key, and touch-press Paste on the menu. Keep in mind 
that for the copy-and-paste function to work for passwords from Password 
Keeper, you need to enable the Allow Clipboard Copy option in the Password 
Keeper options (see the upcoming Table 6-1). You can copy-and-paste only 
one password at a time.
	
After you paste your password in another application, clear the Clipboard by 
pressing the menu key and choosing Clear Clipboard. The Clipboard keeps 
your last copied password until you clear it.
Seeing Password Keeper options
Password Keeper’s Options menu, accessible by pressing the menu key while 
in Password Keeper, allows you to control how Password Keeper behaves. 
For example, you can set what characters can make up a randomly generated 
password. Table 6-1 describes all the options in Password Keeper.

Your BlackBerry Storm brings a fresh new face to the convenience and 
ease of use that are associated with e-mail. You can direct mail to your 
BlackBerry from up to ten e-mail accounts, including the likes of Yahoo! and 
Gmail. You can set up an e-mail signature, configure e-mail filters, and search 
for e-mail messages.
In this chapter, we show you how to use and manage your BlackBerry’s mail 
capabilities to its full potential. From setup to sorts, we have you covered 
here.
Getting Up and Running with E-Mail
Regardless of your network service provider (such as Verizon, Telus, or 
Vodafone), you can set up your BlackBerry to receive mail from at least one 
of your current e-mail accounts. Thus, with whatever address you use to 
send and receive e-mail from your PC (Yahoo!, Gmail, and so on), you can 

98
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
hook up your BlackBerry to use that same e-mail address. Instead of checking 
your Gmail at the Google site, for example, you can get it on your BlackBerry. 
Is your company running a BlackBerry Enterprise Server and MS Exchange 
server but didn’t think to give you a company BlackBerry? No worries; you 
can still get your e-mail via BlackBerry Desktop Redirector. Keep reading.
	
Most network service providers allow you to connect up to ten e-mail 
accounts to your BlackBerry. This capability provides you with the conve­
nience of one central point from which you get all your e-mail.
Using the BlackBerry Internet 
Service client
You can pull together all your e-mail accounts into one by using the BIS 
(BlackBerry Internet Service) client. The BIS client allows you to
	
✓	Manage up to ten e-mail accounts: See the next section, “Combining 
your e-mail accounts into one.”
	
✓	Use wireless e-mail reconciliation: No more trying to match your 
BlackBerry e-mail against e-mail in your combined account(s). Just turn 
on wireless e-mail reconciliation, and you’re good to go. For more on 
this, see the upcoming section “Enabling Wireless Reconciliation.”
	
✓	Create e-mail filters: You can filter e-mails to get only those messages 
that you truly care about on your BlackBerry. See the “Filtering your 
e-mail” section, near the end of this chapter.
Think of the BIS client (also known simply as BIS) as an online e-mail account 
manager that doesn’t keep your messages. Instead, it routes the e-mails from 
your other accounts to your BlackBerry (because it’s directly connected to 
your BlackBerry).
Combining your e-mail accounts into one
To start herding e-mail accounts onto your BlackBerry, you must first run a 
setup program from the BIS client.
	
You can access the BIS client from your BlackBerry or from your desktop com­
puter. To do so on the PC, you need the URL that is specific to your network 
service. Contact your network service provider (such as Verizon or Telus) 
directly to get that information.

99
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
We cover accessing the BIS client from the BlackBerry Storm, but just remem­
ber that you can do all these functions from a Web browser as well.
To get started with BIS client from your BlackBerry:
	
1.	From the BlackBerry Home screen, touch-press the Setup folder.
	
2.	Touch-press the Email Settings icon.
	
	 You are prompted with a login screen similar to Figure 7-1. If you 
haven’t created your account, click the Create button to create your BIS 
account.
	
Figure 7-1: 
The BIS 
client login 
screen 
on the 
BlackBerry.
	
After you’ve logged in, you see a list of e-mail accounts that have been set up, 
as shown in Figure 7-2. If you haven’t set up any e-mail accounts yet, you see 
an Add button. We show you how to add accounts in the next section.
Adding an e-mail account
You can set up your BIS account directly from your Storm. (As we men­
tion earlier in this chapter, you can have up to ten e-mail accounts on your 
BlackBerry.) To add an e-mail account to your BlackBerry account, follow 
these steps on your BlackBerry Storm:

100
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
	
1.	From your BlackBerry Home screen, touch-press the Setup folder.
	
2.	Touch-press the Person E-mail Setup icon.
	
	 You are prompted with a login screen similar to Figure 7-1. If you 
haven’t created your account, click the Create button to create your BIS 
account.
	
3.	After you log in, touch-press Add.
	
	 A screen with different e-mail domains (Yahoo!, Google) appears, as 
shown in Figure 7-3.

101
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
	
4.	Touch-press an e-mail domain.
	
5.	Enter the e-mail address and password, and then touch-press Next.
	
	 If you entered your e-mail credentials correctly, you see the setup con­
firmation screen.
As we mention earlier in this chapter, you can also add an e-mail account to 
your BlackBerry from your desktop PC or Mac via a Web browser. Just follow 
these steps.
	
1.	From the BIS client, click Setup Account.
	
	 Contact your network carrier for the URL to access the BIS client on 
your PC or Mac Web browser.
	
2.	Enter the address and login credentials for that e-mail address.
 
• The e-mail address is the address from which you want to receive 
e-mail — for example, myid@yahoo.com.
 
• The account login is the one you use to log in to this particular 
e-mail account.
 
• The password is the one you use with the login.
	
3.	Click the Next button.
	
	 You’re finished. It’s that easy!
	
Want to log in to the BIS Web site for your carrier? Here’s a list of login 
addresses for some of the popular North American carriers:
	
✓	Bell: https://bis.na.blackberry.com/html?brand=bell
	
✓	Telus: https://bis.na.blackberry.com/html?brand=telus
	
✓	Verizon: https://bis.na.blackberry.com/html?brand=vzw
	
✓	Vodafone: https://bis.eu.blackberry.com/html?brand=vodauk
If ever in doubt, simply go to Google and enter carrier-name BIS login, and the 
first result returned will almost always be the BIS login page for your carrier.
Using Desktop Redirector: 
How enterprising!
If you’re a sole proprietor or consultant who works in a corporation that runs 
Exchange or Lotus and want to get enterprise (corporate) e-mails on your 
own BlackBerry, this section is for you.

102
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
Normally, to get enterprise e-mail, your BlackBerry has to be configured 
with the BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES). This is typical if your employer 
hands you a BlackBerry. However, if you work for a large company as a con­
tractor, you probably won’t get a BlackBerry from the company you work for.
	
When you want to get enterprise e-mail to avoid falling behind (especially 
if you don’t work five days a week), you need Desktop Redirector. To use 
Desktop Redirector, you first need to install BlackBerry Desktop Manager, 
which you can find out how to do in Chapter 15.
After you’ve installed Desktop Manager with Redirector, make sure that 
Redirector starts every time you boot your PC.
	
Some corporations allow Desktop Redirector, but some don’t. Contact your IT 
department for proper setup.
Just a few caveats when using the Desktop Redirector:
	
✓	You get enterprise e-mail as long as your PC is turned on and has a con­
nection to the Internet.
	
✓	When someone sends you an attachment, you can’t retrieve it from your 
BlackBerry.
	
✓	When someone sends you a meeting notice, you can see the notice, but 
you can’t accept or reject it.
Configuring Your E-Mail Signature
By default, your e-mail signature is something like Sent via My BlackBerry, 
which can be cool the first week, showing off to people that you’re à la mode 
with your BlackBerry. But sooner or later, you might not want people to 
know that you are out and about while answering e-mail. Or you might want 
something more personal.
Follow these steps to configure your e-mail signature by using the BIS client 
on your BlackBerry:
	
1.	From your BlackBerry Home screen, touch-press the Setup folder.
	
2.	Touch-press the Email Setting icon.
	
	 You are prompted with a login screen similar to Figure 7-1, earlier in this 
chapter. If you haven’t created your account, click the Create button to 
create your BIS account.	

103
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
	
3.	Log in to the BIS client on the BlackBerry.
	
	 You see the BIS main screen (refer to Figure 7-2, earlier in this chapter).
	
4.	Touch-press the e-mail account for which you want to set up an e-mail 
signature.
	
5.	In the Signature field, type the text for your e-mail signature.
	
6.	Touch-press Save.
Enabling Wireless Reconciliation
With wireless reconciliation, you don’t need to delete the same e-mail in two 
places. The two e-mail inboxes reconcile with each other — hence, the term 
wireless reconciliation. Convenient, huh?
Enabling wireless e-mail synchronization
You can start wireless e-mail synchronization by configuring your BlackBerry:
	
1.	From the Home screen, touch-press Messages.
	
	The Messages application opens, and you see the message list.
	
2.	In the message list, press the menu key and touch-press Options.
	
3.	Touch-press Email Reconciliation.
	
	The Email Reconciliation screen opens, with the following options:
 
• Delete On: Configures how BlackBerry handles e-mail deletion.
 
• Wireless Reconciliation: Turns on or off the wireless sync function.
 
• On Conflict: Controls how BlackBerry handles any inconsistencies 
between e-mail on your BlackBerry and the BIS client.
	
	You can choose who “wins” via the Email Reconciliation option: 
your BlackBerry or the BIS client.
	
4.	For the Delete On option, touch-press one of the following:
 
• Handheld: A delete on your BlackBerry takes effect on your 
BlackBerry only.
 
• Mailbox & Handheld: A delete on your BlackBerry takes effect on 
both your BlackBerry and your inbox on the BIS client.
 
• Prompt: This option makes BlackBerry ask you to confirm at the 
time of deletion.

104
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
	
5.	For Wireless Reconciliation, touch-press On.
	
	 The changes you make on the device will match the ones on your e-mail 
account.
	
6.	For On Conflict, touch-press one of the following in the drop-down list:
 
• Handheld Wins: The e-mail messages in your e-mail account will 
match the ones on the handheld.
 
• Mailbox Wins: The e-mail messages on your handheld will match 
the ones in your e-mail account.
Next, you need to enable Synchronize Deleted Item on the BIS client:
	
1.	From your BlackBerry Home screen, touch-press the Setup folder.
	
2.	Touch-press the Email Setting icon.
	
	 You are prompted with a login screen similar to Figure 7-1, earlier in this 
chapter. If you haven’t created your account, click the Create button to 
create your BIS account.
	
3.	Log in to the BIS client on the BlackBerry.
	
	 You see the BIS main screen (refer to Figure 7-2, earlier in this chapter).
	
4.	Touch-press an e-mail account for which you want to enable 
Synchronize Deleted Item.
	
5.	Touch-press Synchronization Options to expand the options.
	
6.	Make sure that the Deleted Items check box is selected.
	
7.	Touch-press Save.
	
Unfortunately, some e-mail accounts might not work well with the e-mail 
reconciliation feature of the BlackBerry, so you might have to delete an 
e-mail twice.
Permanently deleting e-mail 
from your BlackBerry
	
When you delete e-mail on your BlackBerry, the same message in that e-mail 
account is placed in the Deleted folder. You can set up your BlackBerry to per­
manently delete e-mail, but use this option with caution — after that e-mail is 
gone, it’s gone.
To permanently delete e-mail on the BIS client from your BlackBerry, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.

105
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Options.
	
	 The Options screen opens.
	
3.	Touch-press E-mail Reconciliation.
	
	 The E-mail Reconciliation screen opens.
	
4.	Press the menu key and touch-press Purge Deleted Items.
	
	 You see a listing of all your e-mail accounts.
	
5.	Choose the e-mail account from which you want to purge deleted items.
	
	A screen warns that you are about to purge deleted e-mails on your ser­
vice client.
	
6.	If you’re sure you want to never see these messages again, 
touch-press Yes.
	
	 Deleted e-mails in the selected e-mail account are purged.
	
Unfortunately, some e-mail accounts might not work with the Purge Deleted 
Items feature.
Automating Replies and 
Out-of-Office Messages
Unfortunately, BlackBerry Internet Service doesn’t have the “out-of-office” 
message feature, but that doesn’t mean you can’t work around it.
	
One way to set your out-of-office message is to go to your e-mail service 
account (Gmail, Yahoo!, Hotmail, and so on) and set the out-of-office mes­
sage from there. If you have more than one e-mail account routed to your 
BlackBerry, you have to do this for each. Not ideal, but it works.
Working with E-Mail
From Messages, you send and receive your e-mails and also configure wire­
less e-mail reconciliation with your e-mail account(s).
To access Messages, touch-press the Messages icon on the Home screen.
The message list appears. Your message list can contain e-mail, voice mail 
messages, missed-phone-call notices, Short Message Service (SMS) messages, 
and even saved Web pages.

106
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
Receiving e-mails
Whether you’re concerned about data security or delivery speed, with 
BlackBerry’s up-to-date secured network, you’re in good hands.
And whether you’ve combined accounts or use the plain-vanilla BlackBerry 
e-mail account, you receive your e-mail the same way. When you get an e-mail 
message, your BlackBerry notifies you by displaying a number next to a mail 
icon (an envelope) at the top of the screen. This number represents how 
many new, unread e-mails you have. The asterisk next to the envelope indi­
cates new mail that you haven’t opened in the Messages application.
Your BlackBerry can also notify you of new e-mail by vibration, a sound, 
or both. You can customize this from the Profile application, as detailed in 
Chapter 3.
Retrieving your e-mail is simple:
	
1.	From the Home screen, touch-press the Messages icon.
	
	 Doing so allows you to view your message list.
	
2.	Touch-press the e-mail message you want to read.
	
	 You can tell whether an e-mail is unopened by the small unopened enve­
lope icon on the left side of the e-mail. A read e-mail bears an opened 
envelope icon; a sent e-mail has a check mark as its icon; and a docu­
ment icon represents a draft e-mail.
	
3.	After you finish reading the message, press the escape key to return to 
the message list.
Sorting the message list
The BlackBerry lists items by the date and time you received them, but you 
can sort by different criteria. You can search your e-mail by the sender’s 
name or by keywords. Or you could run a search as broad as looking through 
all the e-mail that has been sent to you. See the later section “Searching 
Messages Like a Pro” for more on searching and sorting. For more predefined 
hot keys, see the upcoming section “Reusing saved searches.”
Saving a message to the saved folder
	
You can save any important e-mail in a folder so you can find it without sorting 
through tons of e-mail. To do so, touch-press the e-mail you want to save, press 
the menu key, and touch-press Save. A pop-up message confirms that your 
e-mail has been saved. Note: Your saved e-mail remains in the message list.

107
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
To retrieve or view a saved e-mail, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press View Saved Messages.
	
	You see the list of all the messages you saved.
	
3.	Touch-press the message you want to view.
Viewing attachments
Your BlackBerry Storm lets you view most e-mail attachments just like you 
can on a desktop PC. And we’re talking sizeable attachments, too, such as 
JPEG photo files and Microsoft Word docs, Microsoft PowerPoint slides, and 
Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. Table 7-1 has a list of supported attachments 
viewable from your BlackBerry.

Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
To tell whether an e-mail has an attachment, look for the standard paper-clip 
icon next to your e-mail in the message list.
You retrieve all the different types of attachments the same way. This makes 
retrieving attachments an easy task. To open an attachment, follow along:
	
1.	With an e-mail open, press the menu key and touch-press Open 
Attachment.
	
	A dialog box appears, asking if you want to view or edit with Documents 
to Go.
	
2.	Touch-press View.
	
	 You see a screen containing the name of the file, a Table of Contents 
option, and a Full Contents option.
 
• For Word documents, you can see different headings in outline 
form with the Table of Contents option.
 
• For picture files, such as a JPEG, you can simply go straight to the 
Full Contents option to see the graphic.
 
• For all supported file types, you see Table of Contents and Full 
Contents options. Depending on the file type, use your judgment 
on when you should use the Table of Contents option.
	
3.	Scroll to Full Contents, press the menu key, and touch-press Retrieve.
	
	 Your BlackBerry attempts to contact the BIS client to retrieve your 
attachment. This action retrieves only part of your attachment. 
BlackBerry retrieves more as you scroll through the attachment.
Editing attachments
Your BlackBerry Storm comes with Documents to Go, a feature that enables 
you to not only view, but also edit Word and PowerPoint documents. You 
can even save the documents to your BlackBerry and later transfer them to 
your PC.
As an example, we show you how to edit a Word document attached to an 
e-mail:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.
	
2.	In the message list, open an e-mail with a Word document attached.
	
	 The e-mail opens for you to read. Notice the little paper clip, indicating 
that it has an attachment.
	
3.	Press the menu key and touch-press Open Attachment.
	
	You are asked whether you want to view the Word document or edit 
with Documents to Go.

109
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
	
4.	Touch-press Edit with Documents to Go.
	
	 You can view your documents.
	
5.	Press the menu key and touch-press Edit Mode.
	
	With Edit Mode, you can edit your document. When you finish editing, 
you can save the doc on your BlackBerry Storm or e-mail it. For these 
steps, you will e-mail it.
	
	 If you want to save the attachment on your BlackBerry, go to the folder 
structure on your BlackBerry. For documents, the default folder struc­
ture is usually in the Document folder.
	
6.	Press the menu key and touch-press Send via E-mail.
	
	An e-mail message opens with the Word document attached. Follow the 
steps in the next section to send this e-mail.
Sending e-mail
The first thing you probably want to do when you get your BlackBerry is 
write an e-mail to let your friends know all about it. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Compose Email.
	
	You’re prompted with a blank e-mail that you need to fill out as you 
would on your PC.
	
3.	In the To field, type the recipient’s name or e-mail address.
	
	 You see a list of your contacts matching the name or address you’re 
typing. You can make a selection from this list.
	
4.	Type your message subject and body.
	
5.	When you’re finished, press the menu key and touch-press Send.
	
	 Your message has wings.
Forwarding e-mail
When you need to share an important e-mail with a colleague or friend, you 
can forward that e-mail. Simply do the following:
	
1.	Open the e-mail.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Forward.
	
3.	Type the recipient’s name or e-mail address in the appropriate space.
	
	 When you start typing your recipient’s name, a drop-down list of your 
contacts appears, and you can choose the recipient from it.

110
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
	
4.	Type a message if needed.
	
5.	Press the menu key and touch-press Send.
	
	 Your message is on its way to your recipient.
	
One frustrating feature lacking in the Storm e-mail experience is the ability to 
edit an e-mail you are forwarding to another recipient. Don’t believe me? Try 
it! When you forward an e-mail, the original e-mail remains as is and you can 
add new text only above the original message. Luckily, third-party applica­
tions such as Forward with Edit and Forward, Reply, and Edit add this func­
tionality. A quick search in App World or the CrackBerry App Store will find 
these titles.
Sending e-mail to multiple people
When you need to send an e-mail to more than one person, just keep adding 
recipient names as needed. You can also add recipient names to receive a CC 
(carbon copy) or BCC (blind carbon copy). Here’s how:
	
1.	Open the e-mail.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Compose Email.
	
3.	Specify the To field for the e-mail recipient and then press the enter 
key.
	
	Another To field is added below the first. The CC field works the 
same way.
	
4.	To add a BCC recipient, press the menu key and touch-press Add BCC.
	
	You see a BCC field. You can specify a blind carbon-copy (BCC) recipi­
ent the same way you do To and CC recipients.
	
Whether you’re writing a new e-mail, replying to an e-mail, or forwarding an 
e-mail, the way you add new CC and BCC fields is the same.
Saving a draft e-mail
	
Sometimes the most skillful wordsmiths find themselves lacking. Don’t fret, 
fellow wordsmith; you can save that e-mail as a draft until your words come to 
you. Just press the menu key and touch-press Save Draft.
Your e-mail is saved as a draft. When you’re ready to send your message, 
choose the draft from the message list. You can tell which messages are 
drafts because they sport a tiny document icon; finished messages have an 
envelope icon.
Attaching any file to your e-mail
Many people are surprised that you can attach any document on your 
BlackBerry Storm or in the microSD card (in your Storm). When we say any 

111
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
file type, we mean Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents, as well as pic­
tures, music, and videos. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Compose.
	
	You’re prompted with a blank e-mail.
	
3.	In the To field, type the recipient’s name or e-mail address.
	
	 You see a list of your contacts matching the name or address that you’re 
typing. You can make a selection from this list.
	
4.	Type your message subject and body.
	
5.	Press the menu key and touch-press Attach File.
	
	You’re prompted with folders. Think of them as the folders on your PC.
	
6.	Touch-press the folders until you get to the file you want to send and 
then touch-press that file.
	
	 You see the file in the e-mail message.
	
7.	Press the menu key and touch-press Send.
	
	 Your message has wings.
Spell-checking your outgoing messages
	
Whether you’re composing an e-mail message or an SMS text message (see 
Chapter 8), you can always check your spelling with the built-in spell checker. 
Simply press the menu key and touch-press Check Spelling.
When it finds an error, the BlackBerry spell checker makes a suggestion. If 
you want to skip that word and go on to the next, press the escape key. 
If you want to skip spell checking altogether for an e-mail, press and hold 
the escape key. (Your Storm does the same type of dotted-underlining as 
Microsoft Word.)
By default, the spell checker doesn’t kick in before you send your message, 
but you can change that:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Options.
	
3.	Touch-press Spell Check.
	
4.	Make sure Spell Check EMail Before Sending is checked.
	
5.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save.

Adding a sender to your Contacts
You can add a message sender’s contact info to your BlackBerry Contacts 
directly from Messages. You don’t even have to copy or write down the per­
son’s name and e-mail address on paper.
To add a sender to your Contacts, follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Home screen, press the menu key and touch-press Messages.
	
2.	Touch-press the e-mail whose sender you want to add to your Contacts 
list.
	
3.	From the opened e-mail, scroll to the sender’s name, press the menu 
key, and then touch-press Add to Contacts.
	
	 The New Contacts screen opens. The sender’s first name, last name, and 
e-mail address are transferred automatically to your Contacts list.
	
4.	If needed, add information (such as phone number and mailing address).
	
5.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
Deleting e-mail
Keeping your message list tidy can help you stay organized and reduce the 
amount of memory your e-mail takes.
Cull those messages you no longer need by following these steps:
	
1.	From the Home screen, touch-press Messages.
	
2.	Tap the e-mail you want to delete and touch-press the Delete Message 
icon at the bottom of the screen.
	
	 A deletion-confirmation screen appears.
	
3.	Touch-press Delete to confirm your deletion.
	
	The deleted e-mail is toast.
	
To delete more than one e-mail, tap the first e-mail you want to delete and, while 
your finger is on that first e-mail, tap the last e-mail you want to delete. This 
highlights the range of e-mails to delete. When you are happy with your deletion 
selection, touch-press the Delete Message icon at the bottom of the screen.
You can delete anything listed in the message list (such as an SMS or a voice 
mail) the same way you delete an e-mail message.

 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
If you want to really clean up your old e-mails and don’t want to scroll 
through tons of messages, you can do the following:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.
	
2.	Tap a horizontal date mark, press the menu key, and touch-press 
Delete Prior.
	
	 The date mark is simply a horizontal bar with dates. Just as you can 
highlight e-mails in the message list, you can highlight the date marks.
	
	 A pop-up window prompts you for delete confirmation. Before you take 
the plunge, remember that going ahead will delete all the e-mails before 
the particular date mark. There is no way to retrieve deleted items from 
your BlackBerry.
	
3.	Touch-press Delete to confirm your deletion.
	
	All e-mails prior to the date mark are history.
Filtering your e-mail
Most of your e-mail messages aren’t urgent. Instead of receiving them on 
your BlackBerry — and wasting both time and effort — filter them out. While 
in the BIS client, set up filters to make your BlackBerry mailbox receive only 
those e-mails that you care about. (Don’t worry; you’ll still receive them on 
your main computer.)
The following example creates a simple filter that treats work-related mes­
sages as urgent and forwards them to your BlackBerry:
	
1.	From your BlackBerry Home screen, touch-press the Setup folder.
	
2.	Touch-press the Email Settings icon.
	
	 You are prompted with a login screen similar to Figure 7-1, earlier in this 
chapter. If you haven’t created your account, click the Create button and 
create your BIS account.
	
3.	Log in to the BIS client on the BlackBerry.
	
	 You see the BIS main screen (refer to Figure 7-2, earlier in this chapter).
	
4.	Touch-press the e-mail account for which you want to set up filters.
	
5.	Press the menu key and touch-press Filters.
	
	You see a list of filters, if any, and an Add Filter button, as shown in 
Figure 7-4.
	
6.	Touch-press the Add Filter button.

114
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
	
	 The Add Filter screen appears, as shown in Figure 7-5.
	
7.	Enter a filter name.
	
	 The filter name can be anything you like. In Figure 7-5, we entered 
To Me.

 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
	
8.	From the Filter On drop-down list, choose the condition to place on 
the filter:
 
• High-Priority Mail Email: Select this option if the filter applies only 
to urgent e-mail.
 
• Subject: When this option is selected, the Contains field is enabled 
and you can type text in it. Specify what keywords the filter will look 
for in the subject field, separating each entry with a semicolon (;).
 
• From Address: When this option is selected, the Contains field is 
enabled and you can type text in it. Type a full address or part of 
an address. For example, you can type rob@robkao.com or just kao. 
Separate each entry with a semicolon (;).
 
• To Address: This option is similar to the From Field Contains 
option.
	
• CC Address: This option is similar to the From Field Contains 
option.
	
	 This example selects From Address.
	
9.	Specify the text in the Contains field.
	
	 See details in the preceding step for what to enter in the Contains 
field. This example types the domain of your work e-mail address. For 
example, if your work e-mail address is myName@XYZCo.com, enter 
XYZCo.com.
	
10.	Select one of the following options for the Action field:
	
	Forward Messages to the Device: You can select either or both of the 
following two check boxes:
 
• Header Only: Choose this if you want only the header of the e-mails 
that meets the condition(s) you set in Steps 7–9 to be sent to you. 
(A header doesn’t contain the message — just who sent it, the sub­
ject, and the time it was sent.) Choose this if you get automated 
alerts, for which receiving only the subject is sufficient.
 
• Level1 Notification: Level1 notification is another way of saying 
urgent e-mail. A Level1 e-mail is bold in Messages.
	
	 Do Not Forward Message to the Device: Any e-mail that meets the con­
ditions you set in Steps 7–9 doesn’t go to your BlackBerry.
	
11.	Confirm your filter by touch-pressing the Save button.
	
	 You return to the Filter screen, where you can see your newly created 
filter in the list.

If you have a hard time setting the criteria for a filter, guesstimate and then 
check it by having a friend send you a test e-mail. If the test e-mail isn’t filtered 
correctly, set the conditions until you get them right.
Searching Messages Like a Pro
Searching is one of those functions you probably won’t use every day — but 
when you do run a search, you usually need the information fast. Take a few 
minutes here to familiarize yourself with general searching.
The BlackBerry Messages application provides three ways to search through 
your messages. Two of the three ways are specific, and one is a broad search:
	
✓	Search by sender or recipient: Specific. This method assumes that you 
already know the sender or recipient.
	
✓	Search by subject: Specific. This approach assumes that you already 
know the subject.
	
✓	General search: Broad. You don’t have a specific assumption.
	
You can search through anything listed in the messages list. This means you 
can search through SMS and voice mail as well as e-mail.
Searching by sender or recipient
Search by sender or recipient when you’re looking for a specific message 
from a specific person. Suppose that your brother constantly sends you 
e-mail (which means your message list has many entries from him). You’re 
trying to locate a message he sent you about two weeks ago regarding a 
fishing-trip location. You’ve scrolled down the message list, but you just can’t 
find that message.
To find a message when you know the sender or recipient, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.
	
2.	Tap a message that you sent to or received from that particular 
person.
	
	The choice you get in the next step depends on whether you highlighted 
a sent message or a received message.

117
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
	
3.	Press the menu key and touch-press one of these options:
 
• From Someone Specific: Because that certain someone sent you 
the message, choose Search Sender.
 
• To Someone Specific: Because you sent that certain someone the 
message, choose Search Recipient.
	
	 The search starts. Any results appear onscreen.
	
You can shortcut search by sender or recipient by tapping and holding the 
name in the message list. You can also search by the subject of an e-mail if you 
tap and hold the subject.
Searching by subject
Search by subject when you’re looking for a specifically titled e-mail. As when 
you’re searching by sender or recipient, first scroll to an e-mail bearing the 
same subject you’re searching for. Then follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.
	
2.	Highlight an e-mail titled by the subject you’re searching for.
	
3.	Press the menu key and touch-press Search Subject.
	
	 The search starts, and the results appear onscreen.
	
You can shortcut search by subject by tapping and holding the subject that 
you want to search in the message list.
Running a general search
A general search is a broad search from which you can perform keyword 
searches of your messages. To run a general search:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Search.
	
	 The Search screen appears.
	
3.	Fill in your search criteria (see Figure 7-6).
	
	 The criteria for a general search follow:
 
• Name: This is the name of the sender or recipient to search by.

118
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
 
• In: This is related to Name. Use this menu to indicate where the 
name might appear. Your choices are From, To, Cc, Bcc, and any 
address field.
 
• Subject: This is where you type some or all the keywords that 
appear in the subject.
 
• Message: Enter keywords that appear in the message.
 
• Service: If you set up your BlackBerry to receive e-mail from more 
than one e-mail account, you can specify which e-mail account to 
search.
 
• Folder: This is the folder you want to look in. Generally, you should 
search all folders.
 
• Show: This list specifies how the search result will appear (namely, 
whether you want to see only e-mails that you sent or e-mails that 
you received). Your choices are Sent and Received, Received Only, 
Sent Only, Saved Only, Draft Only, and Unopened Only.
 
• Type: This list specifies the type of message you’re trying to 
search for. Your choices are All, EMail, EMail with Attachments, 
PIN, SMS, Phone, and Voice Mail.
	
	You can set multiple search criteria or a single criterion; it’s up to you.
	
4.	Press the menu key and touch-press Search to launch your search.
	
	The search results appear onscreen.
	
Figure 7-6: 
The Search 
screen in 
Messages.
	

119
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
	
You can narrow the search results by performing a second search on the ini­
tial results. For example, you can search by sender and then narrow those 
results by performing a second search by subject.
You can also search by sender or recipient when you’re looking for a specific 
message from a specific person. To do so, finger-scroll to an e-mail bearing 
the specific sender or recipient. Press the menu key and touch-press Search 
Sender or Search Recipient. If the e-mail you highlighted is an incoming e-mail, 
you’ll see Search Sender. If the e-mail is outgoing, you’ll see Search Recipient.
Saving search results
If you find yourself searching with the same criteria over and over, you might 
want to save the search and then reuse it. Here’s how:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Search.
	
	 The Search screen appears.
	
3.	Fill in your search criteria.
	
	 Refer to the “Running a general search” section, earlier in this chapter, 
for option explanations.
	
4.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
	
	 The Save Search screen appears (see Figure 7-7). In this screen, you can 
name your search and assign it a shortcut key.
	
Figure 7-7: 
Name your 
search and 
assign it a 
shortcut

120
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
	
5.	In the Title field, enter a name.
	
	 The title is the name of your search, which appears in the search result 
screen.
	
6.	Touch-press the Shortcut Key field and then touch-press a letter in the 
drop-down list.
	
	 You have 20-plus letters to choose among.
	
7.	Confirm your saved search by pressing the menu key and touch-
pressing Save.
Reusing saved searches
Your BlackBerry comes with five saved search results. Any new saved result 
makes your search that much more robust.
You can see all saved search results:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Search.
	
3.	Press the menu key and touch-press Recall.
	
	 The recall screen opens, and you can see the seven preloaded search 
shortcuts, as shown in Figure 7-8.
To reuse one of the saved search results, choose a search from the list 
(shown in Figure 7-8), press the menu key, and touch-press Search.
To access all your incoming e-mail via shortcut key combination Alt+I, do the 
following:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Show Keyboard.
	
3.	Touch-press the Alt key.
	
	 The Alt key on the virtual keyboard looks like !?123.
	
4.	Touch-press the I key.
	
	 The Messages application will now show only incoming e-mails.

Long Live E-Mail
No closet has unlimited space, and your BlackBerry e-mail storage has 
limits, too. You’ve likely pondered how long your e-mails are kept in your 
BlackBerry. (The default is 30 days. Pshew.)
You can choose several options, ranging from 15 days to forever, and 
because your BlackBerry Storm comes with 1GB of internal memory, it 
should last you a while!
	
Because any message you save is kept for as long as you want, saving a mes­
sage is a good way to make sure you don’t lose an important one.
To change how long your e-mails live on your BlackBerry, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Options.
	
3.	Touch-press General Options.

122
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
	
4.	Touch-press Keep Messages and then touch-press Forever.
 
• Forever: If you choose Forever, you’ll seldom need to worry about 
your e-mails being automatically deleted.
	
	A good way to archive your e-mail is to back up your e-mails by 
using BlackBerry Desktop Manager. See Chapter 15 for more on 
backing up your BlackBerry on your PC.
 
• Time Option: If you choose a set time option, any message older 
than that time frame is automatically deleted from your BlackBerry 
the next time you reboot your BlackBerry. However, it will be 
deleted only on your BlackBerry — even if you turn on e-mail 
reconciliation — because these deletions are not completed 
manually by you.
	
5.	Confirm your changes by pressing the menu key and touch-pressing 
Save.

our BlackBerry is primarily a communication tool, with e-mail messages 
and phone conversations as the major drivers. It’s a wonderful technol­
ogy, but sometimes, another means of communication is more appropriate. 
For instance, e-mail isn’t the tool of choice when you want to send a message 
instantly or when you want to alert someone to something.
Your BlackBerry offers some less-obvious ways to communicate — ways 
that may serve as the perfect fit for a special situation. In this chapter, you 
get the scoop on PIN-to-PIN messaging and text messaging (also known as 
Short Message Service, or SMS). We also give you tips on how to turn your 
BlackBerry into a lean (and not-so-mean) instant messaging (IM) machine.
Sending and Receiving 
PIN-to-PIN Messages
PIN-to-PIN messaging is based on the technology that underpins two-way 
pager systems. Unlike sending a standard e-mail, when you send a BlackBerry 
PIN-to-PIN message, the message doesn’t venture outside the RIM infrastruc­
ture in search of an e-mail server and (eventually) an e-mail inbox. Instead, 
it stays solidly in the RIM world, where it is shunted through the recipient’s 
network provider until it ends up in the recipient’s BlackBerry.

124
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
So when you use PIN-to-PIN messaging, that’s another way of saying sending a 
message from one BlackBerry to another BlackBerry.
	
PIN stands for personal identification number (familiar to anyone who’s ever 
used an ATM) and refers to a system for uniquely identifying your device.
Here’s the neat part. According to RIM, the message isn’t saved anywhere in 
this universe except on the one device that sends the PIN message and the 
other device that receives it. Compare that with an e-mail, which is saved 
in at least four locations (both the sender and recipient’s e-mail clients and 
e-mail servers), not to mention all the system’s redundancies and backups 
employed by the server. Think of it this way: If you whisper a little secret in 
someone’s ear, only you and that special someone know what was said. In a 
way, PIN-to-PIN messaging is the same thing, with one BlackBerry whispering 
to another BlackBerry. Now, that’s discreet.
If you tend to read the financial newspapers — especially the ones that cover 
corporate lawsuits extensively — you’ll know that there’s no such thing as 
privacy in e-mail. PIN-to-PIN messaging, in theory at least, is as good as the old 
Code of Silence. Now, is such privacy an advantage? You can argue both sides 
of the issue, depending on what you want to use PIN-to-PIN messaging for.
Basically, if you like the idea that your communications can be kept discreet, 
PIN-to-PIN messaging has great curb appeal. If you don’t care about privacy 
A little bit of RIM history
Sometime during the last millennium, Research 
In Motion (RIM) wasn’t even in the phone busi­
ness. Before BlackBerry became all the rage 
with smart phone features, RIM was doing a 
tidy little business with its wireless e-mail.
Back then, RIM’s primitive wireless e-mail ser­
vice was served by network service providers 
on a radio bandwidth: DataTAC and Mobitex 
networks. These were separate from a typical 
cellphone infrastructure’s bandwidth.
RIM devices at that time already had PIN-to-
PIN messaging. This type of messaging is akin 
to a pager, where a message doesn’t live in a 
mailbox but is sent directly to the BlackBerry 
with no delay. (No one wants a paging system 
that moves at turtle speed when you can get 
one that moves like a jackrabbit, right?)
Several interesting facts followed from RIM’s 
initial decision. Of note, most cellphone users 
in New York City were left without service 
during the 9/11 disaster. The entire cellphone 
infrastructure in New York and surrounding 
areas was overwhelmed with too many people 
trying to use the available bandwidth. However, 
one communication device continued to work 
during that stressful time: RIM’s PIN-to-PIN 
messaging kept the information flow going.

125
 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail
issues, you still may be impressed by PIN-to-PIN messaging’s zippy nature. (It 
really is the Ferrari of wireless communication — way faster than e-mail.)
	
The Code of Silence in an enterprise environment has always been a thorny 
issue in companies with strict regulatory requirements. As expected, RIM 
addressed this issue with a new feature in later operating systems allowing 
BlackBerry Enterprise Server administrators to flip a flag, forcing the device to 
forward all PIN-to-PIN messages to the BlackBerry Enterprise Server. A com­
pany can also install on the device third-party applications to report PIN-to-
PIN messages.
Getting a BlackBerry PIN
When you try to call someone on the telephone, you can’t get far without a 
telephone number. As you may expect, the same principle applies to PIN-to-
PIN messaging: no PIN, no PIN-to-PIN messaging.
	
In practical terms, you need the PIN of any BlackBerry to which you want to 
send a PIN message. (You also need to find out your own PIN so that you can 
hand it out to folks who want to PIN-message you.)
The cautious side of you may wonder why on earth you’d give your PIN to 
someone. Here’s the difference: Unlike a PIN for an ATM account, this PIN 
isn’t your password. In fact, this PIN doesn’t give anyone access to your 
BlackBerry or do anything to compromise security. It’s simply an ID; think of 
it like a phone number.
Here are two quick paths to PIN enlightenment:
	
✓	From the Message screen: Send your PIN from the Message screen with 
the help of a keyword. When you type a preset word, your BlackBerry 
replaces what you type with a bit of information specific to your device.
	
	Sound wacky? It’s easier than it sounds:
	
a.	Compose a new message.
	
	If you need a refresher on the whole e-mail message and messaging 
thing, visit Chapter 7.
	
b.	In the subject or body of your message, type Mypin and add a 
space.
	
	See the left side of Figure 8-1. As soon as you type the space, 
Mypin is miraculously transformed into your PIN in the format 
pin:your-pin-number, as shown on the right side of Figure 8-1. 
Isn’t that neat? Note: Case doesn’t matter here.

126
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
	
	Mypin isn’t the only keyword that RIM predefines for you. mynumber 
and myver give you the phone number and OS version, respectively, of 
your BlackBerry Storm.
	
✓	From the Status screen: You can also find your PIN on the Status screen. 
From the Home screen, touch-press Options and then touch-press 
Status. Figure 8-2 shows a typical Status screen. (The PIN is fourth in the 
list of items.)

Assigning PINs to names
So you convince your BlackBerry-wielding buddies to go to the trouble of 
finding out their PINs and passing said PINs to you. Now the trick is finding 
a convenient place to store those PINs so you can use them. Luckily for you, 
you have an obvious choice: BlackBerry Contacts. And RIM, in its infinite 
wisdom, makes storing such info a snap. To add a PIN to someone’s contact 
info in Contacts, do the following:
	
1.	From the BlackBerry Home screen, touch-press Contacts.
	
	 Contacts opens.
	
2.	Touch a contact name, press the menu key, and then touch-press Edit.
	
	 The Edit Contact screen for the contact name you touch-pressed makes 
an appearance.
	
3.	On the Edit Contact screen, slide up to scroll down to the PIN field (as 
shown in Figure 8-3).
	
4.	Type the PIN.
	
5.	Press the menu key and then touch-press Save.
	
	The edit you made for the contact is saved.
It’s that simple. Of course, it’s even easier if you think ahead and enter the 
PIN information you have when you set up your initial contact info (by using 
the New Contact screen), but we understand that a PIN isn’t the kind of infor­
mation people carry around.

If all this talk about New Contact screens and Edit Contact screens doesn’t 
sound familiar, check out Chapter 4, which covers the Contacts application in 
more detail.
Sending a PIN-to-PIN message
	
PIN-to-PIN just means from one BlackBerry to another.
Sending a PIN-to-PIN message is no different from sending an e-mail. 
Here’s how:
	
1.	From the BlackBerry Home screen, touch-press Contacts.
	
2.	Touch a contact name and then press the menu key.
	
	 If a contact has a PIN, you see a menu item titled PIN <contact name>. 
Say, for example, you have a contact named Rob Kao. When you touch 
Dante Sarigumba in the list and then press the menu key, the menu item 
PIN Rob Kao appears as an option, as shown in Figure 8-4.
	
3.	Touch-press PIN <contact name> on the menu.
	
	 You see the ever-familiar New Message screen.
	
4.	Enter the rest of the text fields — subject, message, and signature 
text — just as you would with an e-mail.
	
Figure 8-4:

via your 
Contacts.
	

129
 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail
Alternatively, if you know the PIN, you can type it directly. Here’s how:
	
1.	From the BlackBerry Home screen, touch-press Messages.
	
	 The Messages application opens.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Compose PIN.
	
	 The New Message screen makes an appearance.
	
3.	Type the PIN in the To field.
	
4.	Add a subject line, the message, and signature, just like you would in 
an e-mail.
	
Unlike when you send an e-mail, when you send a PIN-to-PIN message, you can 
tell almost instantly whether the recipient got your message. In the Messages 
list, the letter D (for delivered) appears on top of the check mark next to the 
PIN-to-PIN message you sent.
	
Because of the nature of PIN-to-PIN messaging (the conspicuous lack of a 
paper trail, as it were), companies can disable PIN-to-PIN messaging on your 
BlackBerry device. (No paper trail can mean legal problems down the road — 
can you say Sarbanes-Oxley?)
Receiving a PIN-to-PIN message
Receiving a PIN-to-PIN message is no different from receiving a standard 
e-mail. You get the same entry in your Messages list for the PIN-to-PIN mes­
sage, and the same screen appears when you open the message.
By default, your BlackBerry vibrates to alert you, but you can change this 
behavior by changing your profile. (Check out Chapter 3 for details.) When 
you reply to the message, the reply is a PIN-to-PIN message as well.
Keeping in Touch the SMS/MMS Way
Short Message Service (also known as SMS, or text messaging) is so popu­
lar that you’ve probably seen TV shows asking for your feedback via SMS. 
Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) is a much later evolution of SMS. 
Rather than sending a simple text message, you can also send someone an 
audio or a video clip.

130
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
	
How short is short? The maximum size per message is about 160 characters. If 
you send more than that, it gets broken down into multiple messages.
SMS is an established technology (not a new and unproven thing, in other 
words) that’s been popular for years in Europe and Asia.
	
Text messaging does pose a challenge for beginners. It isn’t tough; it’s just 
cumbersome to type the letters on a small virtual keyboard and keep up with 
the conversation. Also, you need to know the trends and options for text mes­
saging. In-the-know folks use abbreviations that may be difficult for you to 
understand in the beginning, so don’t dive in without your oxygen tank.
A quick preparation goes a long way toward avoiding being labeled uncool 
when it comes to your SMS syntax. The upcoming sections help smooth your 
path a bit by filling you in on the basics of SMS-speak.
Using shorthand for speedy replies
On a regular cellphone, three letters share a single key. Typing even a single 
paragraph can be a real pain.
Human ingenuity prevails. Abbreviations cut down on the amount of text 
you need to enter. Texting (short for text messaging) language is fashionable, 
especially among the 14–18-year-old set. Veteran text messagers (the hip 
ones, at least) can easily spot someone who’s new to SMS technology by how 
that person doesn’t use the right lingo — or uses such lingo incorrectly.
AWHFY?
In text messaging, the challenge lies in using abbreviations to craft a sentence 
with as few letters as possible. Because text messaging has been around for 
a number of years, plenty of folks have risen to this challenge by coming up 
with a considerable pool of useful abbreviations. Don’t feel that you have to 
rush out and memorize the whole shorthand dictionary at once, though.
	
As with mastering a new language, start with the most commonly used words 
or sentences. When you become familiar with those, slowly gather in more 
and more terms. In time, the language will be second nature.
Table 8-1 gives you our take on the most common abbreviations, which are 
enough to get you started. With these under your belt, you can at least follow 
the most important parts of an SMS conversation. Feel free to check out the 
Web site associated with this book (www.blackberryfordummies.com) for

Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
Showing some emotion
Written words can get folks into trouble every now and then; the same words 
can mean different things to different people. A simple example is the phrase 
“You’re clueless.” When you speak such a phrase with the appropriate facial 
and hand gestures, your friend knows that you’re teasing and that it’s all a bit 
of fun. Write that same phrase in a text message, and . . . well, you may get a 
nasty reply — which you then have to respond to, which prompts another 
response, and soon enough, you’ve just ended a seven-year friendship.
SMS is akin to chatting, so emoticons show what you mean when you write 
“You’re clueless.” (I’m joking! I’m happy! I’m mad!) These cutesy codes help 
you telegraph your meaning in sledgehammer-to-the-forehead fashion.
We’re talking smileys here — those combinations of keyboard characters 
that, when artfully combined, resemble a human face. The most popular 
example — one that you’ve probably encountered in e-mails from especially 
chirpy individuals — is the happy face, which (usually at the end of a state­
ment) conveys good intentions or happy context, like this :). (Tilt your head 
to the left to see the face.)
Table 8-2 shows you the range of smiley choices. Just remember that smileys 
are supposed to be fun. They could be the one thing you need to make sure 
that your “gently teasing remark” isn’t seen as a hateful comment. Smileys 
help, but if you aren’t sure if what you’re about to send can be misconstrued 
even with the help of the smileys, just don’t send it.
Your BlackBerry Storm also comes with a handful of smileys. While you’re 
on the conversation or chat screen, press the menu key and touch-press Add 
Smiley to choose an available smiley.

Shorthand and smileys may not be appreciated in business. Use them 
appropriately.
Sending a text message
After you have the shorthand stuff and smileys under control, get your fin­
gers pumped up and ready for action: It’s message-sending time! Whether it’s 
SMS or MMS, here’s how to do it:

134
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
	
1.	From the BlackBerry Home screen, touch-press Contacts.
	
2.	Touch-press a contact that has a mobile phone number.
	
	 SMS works only on mobile phones.
	
3.	Press the menu key and touch-press SMS (or MMS) <contact name>.
	
	 The menu item for SMS or MMS knows enough to display the name of 
the contact. For example, if you choose John Doe, the menu item reads 
SMS John Doe or MMS John Doe, as shown in Figure 8-5.
	
Figure 8-5: 
Start your 
text 
message 
here.
	
	
4.	If you choose MMS, browse your multimedia folders, and touch-press 
the audio or video file you want to send.
	
	 When you’re choosing MMS, this extra step allows you to choose the mul­
timedia file, which is the only difference from composing an SMS message.
	
5.	Type your message.
	
	 Remember that shorthand business? You should start taking advantage 
of it the first chance you get. (Practice makes perfect.)
	
6.	Press the menu key and then touch-press Send.
	
	 Your message is sent on its merry way.

135
 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail
Viewing a message you receive
If you have an incoming SMS or MMS message, you get a notification just like 
you do when you receive an e-mail. Also like e-mail, the e-mail icon at the top 
of the Home screen indicates a new message. Viewing an SMS or MMS mes­
sage is the same as reading an e-mail. The basic run-through is as follows:
	
1.	Touch-press Messages from the Home screen.
	
2.	Touch-press the unread message.
	
	 Bob’s your uncle: The message appears onscreen.
Messaging etiquette and a few words of caution
Here are some commonsense messaging rules 
as well as a few words of caution. Even if you’re 
new to messaging, being a neophyte doesn’t 
give you license to act like a jerk. Play nice and 
take the following pointers to heart:
	✓	Use smileys to avoid misunderstandings. 
Read more about emoticons and smileys in 
this chapter.
	✓	Don’t ever forward chain letters. We mean 
it. Never.
	✓	If you need to forward a message, check 
the entire message content first. Make 
sure nothing offends the recipient.
	✓	Some things in this world need to be said 
face to face, so don’t even think of using 
messaging for it. Ever try dumping your girl­
friend or boyfriend over the phone? Guess 
what? Using messaging is far worse.
	✓	Keep your tone gender neutral. Some mes­
sages that are forwarded through e-mails 
are inappropriate to the opposite sex.
	✓	Capital letters are as rude as shouting, so 
DON’T USE THEM.
	✓	Know your recipient. A newbie might not 
easily grasp smileys and shorthand at 
first, so act accordingly. (Read more about 
shorthand in this chapter.)
	✓	Don’t reply to any message when you’re 
angry. You can’t unsend a sent message. 
It’s better to be prudent than sorry.
	✓	Don’t gossip or be rude. Beware! Your mes­
sages can end up in the wrong hands and 
haunt you in the future.
	✓	Easy does it. No documented evidence 
reveals the deleterious effects (physi­
cal or psychological) of too much tex­
ting. However, don’t text as if you want to 
enter the books as the first recorded case 
of Instantmessagingitis. As your great-
grandma would tell you, too much of any­
thing is bad for you. It’s easy to lose track 
of time when IMing.
	✓	Drive safely. Tuck away your BlackBerry 
whenever you’re in the driver’s seat.

136
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
	
Customize how your BlackBerry notifies you when you receive an SMS mes­
sage. See Chapter 3 for more details.
	
You can tell your BlackBerry to separate SMS messages from e-mail messages:
	
1.	Touch-press Messages from the Home screen.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Options.
	
3.	Touch-press General Options.
	
4.	Touch-press the SMS and Email Inboxes selections.
	
5.	Touch-press Separate.
	
6.	Press the escape key and touch-press Save.
	
	 An icon for SMS appears on the Home screen.
Always Online Using Instant Messaging
Real-time (as they happen) conversations with your friends over the Internet 
are possible with IM (instant messaging). IM enables two or more people to 
send and receive messages over the Internet. Instant messaging started with 
pure text messages and evolved into a rich medium involving voice and even 
video conversation in real time.
	
IM may not be available on your BlackBerry Storm. Service providers choose 
whether to include it. However, you can add IM to your BlackBerry:
	
1.	Touch-press Browser from the home screen.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Go To.
	
3.	Enter http://mobile.blackberry.com and touch-press Go.
	
4.	Navigate to IM and Social Networking.
	
	 Here, you’ll find download links for all the free applications for the popu­
lar IM networks and also a download link for BlackBerry Messenger. 
(Chapter 9 covers BlackBerry Messenger.)
Chatting using IM rules
When you’re IMing — that’s right; it’s a verb — you can tell lots of things:
	
✓	When someone’s typing a message to you
	
✓	Whether your buddies are online

137
 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail
	
✓	When your buddies are away from their computers
	
✓	When your buddies are simply too busy to be interrupted at the moment
IM adds a totally different slant on long-distance communication, opening a 
wide array of possibilities — possibilities that can be used for good (team 
collaboration) or ill (mindless gossip), depending on the situation.
As you may expect, IM is great for both personal and business applications. 
Whether you’re maintaining friendships or working to create new ones, IM is 
definitely one powerful tool to consider adding to your social-skills toolbox.
Instant messaging on your BlackBerry
Most network providers dish out the three most popular IM services to their 
BlackBerry customers:
	
✓	Google Talk
	
✓	Yahoo! (Y!) Messenger
	
✓	Windows Live Messenger
Those three IM programs aren’t the only popular ones. Here are a few more:
	
✓	AOL Instant Messenger (AIM)
	
✓	ICQ Instant Messenger
	
✓	iChat AV (on the Macintosh)
	
✓	Jabber (open source)
If you’re using an IM network that isn’t preloaded, you can always check the 
RIM Web site to download the applications at mobile.blackberry.com. On 
this page, go to IM and Social Networking. The list of IM applications should 
be listed on the next page with a link for download.
IM basics: What you need
Assuming that you have the IM application available on your BlackBerry, you 
need just two things to start using the standard five IM programs:
	
✓	User ID
	
✓	Password

138
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
Getting a user ID/password combo is a breeze. Just go to the appropriate 
registration Web page (from the following list) for the IM application(s) you 
want to use. Note that it’s easier and faster to use your desktop or laptop to 
sign up.
	
✓	Google Talk: www.google.com/accounts/
NewAccount?service=talk
	
✓	AOL Instant Messenger (AIM): https://reg.my.screenname.aol.
com/_cqr/registration/initRegistration.psp
	
✓	ICQ Instant Messenger: www.icq.com/register
	
✓	Windows Live Messenger: http://messenger.msn.com/download/
getstarted.aspx
	
✓	Yahoo! Messenger: http://edit.yahoo.com/config/eval_
register?.src=pg&.done=http://
messenger.yahoo.com
	
Given the many IM network choices available, your friends are probably 
signed up on a bunch of different networks. You might end up having to sign 
up for multiple networks if you want to reach them all via IM.
	
Although Twitter may not fall under the umbrella of instant messaging ser­
vices in the traditional sense, it is quickly becoming the communication 
medium of choice for millions of people. Several free and premium Twitter cli­
ents have emerged. TwitterBerry was the first and maintains a loyal user base, 
but I recommend checking out UberTwitter, TweetGenius, or SocialScope for 
your Twitter needs. When you’re all set up, be sure to send me a tweet at 
@crackberrykevin and say hi!
Going online with IM
After you obtain the user ID/password combo for one (or more) IM services, 
you can use your BlackBerry to start chatting with your buddies by following 
these steps:
	
1.	From the BlackBerry Home screen, touch-press the IM application of 
your choice.
	
	 To illustrate how to do this, we use Google Talk. An application-specific 
login screen appears for you to sign on, similar to the one in Figure 8-6. 
It’s straightforward, with the standard screen name (also called a user 
name or ID) line and password line.
	
2.	Enter your screen name/ID and password.

139
 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail
	
Figure 8-6: 
 Login 
screen for 
Google Talk.
	
	
3.	If you want, touch-press the Remember Password check box. Also if 
you want, touch-press the Automatically Sign Me In check box.
	
	When the Remember Password check box is enabled, the ID/password 
information is preentered the next time you come back to this screen. 
(Um, that is, you don’t have to type this stuff every time you want to IM.)
	
	 We recommend that you touch-press this check box to save time but 
also set your smart phone password to Enabled so that security isn’t 
compromised. Refer to Chapter 3 if you need a refresher on how to 
enable passwords on your BlackBerry.
	
	 The Automatically Sign Me In check box turns on and off sign-in when 
your BlackBerry Storm is powered up. This is helpful if you have a habit 
of turning off your BlackBerry periodically.
	
4.	Press the menu key and touch-press Sign In.
	
	 At this point, IM tries to log you in. This can take a few seconds, during 
which time the screen reads Sending request to AOL or something 
similar while it’s in this phase. After you’re logged in, a simple listing of 
your contacts, or buddies, appears onscreen.
	
5.	Touch-press the person you’d like to chat with.
	
	 A menu appears, listing various things you can do. Features could differ 
a bit for each IM application, but for Google Talk, here’s a sample of 
what you can do: Start Chat, Send File, Add a Friend, Rename, Remove, 
and Block.
	
6.	Touch-press the action you’d like to take.

140
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
Adding a contact, buddy, or friend
A contact may be referred to as contact, buddy, or friend in the IM app. But 
before you can start chatting with your contacts, you need to know their user 
IDs. See Table 8-3.
Table 8-3	
Getting a Friend’s Credentials
Provider
Where You Get Someone’s User ID
AOL Instant Messenger
Your friend or by searching AOL’s directory
Google Talk
The text before the @ sign in his or her Google e-mail 
address
ICQ Instant Messenger
Your friend’s e-mail or the ICQ Global Directory
Windows Live Messenger
MSN Passport ID or Hotmail ID
Yahoo! Messenger
The text before the @ sign in his or her Yahoo! e-mail 
address
Luckily for you, you don’t need to search for an ID every time you want to IM 
someone. You can store IDs as part of a contacts list. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Starting within the IM service of your choice, press the menu key.
	
2.	Touch-press the Add a Friend option, which is shown in Figure 8-7.
	
	 The Add a Friend screen appears.
	
3.	Enter the user ID of your contact on the Add a Friend screen.
	
Figure 8-7: 
Adding a 
friend.
	

141
 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail
	
4.	Touch-press OK.
	
	 IM is smart enough to figure out whether this contact has a valid user ID. 
If the ID is valid, the application adds the ID to your list of contacts. The 
buddy goes either to the Online or Offline section of your list, depending 
on whether he or she is logged in. If the ID you entered isn’t valid, you 
are warned.
Doing the chat thing
Suppose you want to start a conversation with one of your contacts (a safe 
assumption, we think). When you send a message within the IM application, 
you’re initiating a conversation. Here’s how:
	
1.	Log in to the IM application of your choice.
	
2.	Touch-press the person you want to contact.
	
	 A typical online chat screen shows up. The top portion lists old mes­
sages sent to and received from this contact. You type your message at 
the bottom part of the screen.
	
3.	Type your message.
	
4.	Touch-press the enter key.
	
	 Your user ID and the message you just sent show up in the topmost (his­
tory) section of the chat screen. When you get a message, it’s added to 
the history section so that both sides of your conversation stay in view.
Sending your smile
You can quickly add emoticons to your message (without having to remem­
ber all the character equivalents in Table 8-2, earlier in this chapter). Follow 
these steps:
	
1.	While you’re typing your message, press the menu key.
	
2.	On the menu that appears, touch-press Add Smiley.
	
	 A screen appears displaying all the icons.
	
3.	Touch-press the emoticon you want.
	
	 The emoticon is added to your message.
Taking control of your IM app
If you use IM frequently — and you tend to chat with many contacts at the 
same time — your BlackBerry’s physical limitations may cramp your IM style. 

142
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
It’s no doubt slower to type words on the tiny virtual keypad than it is to type 
on your PC.
Do you just give up on the dream of IMing on the go? Not necessarily. The fol­
lowing sections show how you can power up your BlackBerry IM technique.
When less is more
If you can’t keep up with all your buddies, your best bet is to limit your expo­
sure. Take a whack at your contacts list so that only your true friends remain 
as contacts whom you want to IM from your BlackBerry. Trimming your list is 
easy. To delete a contact from your IM application, highlight the contact from 
the main screen of the IM application, press the menu key, and touch-press 
Delete.
	
Deleting a contact or buddy from an IM application on your BlackBerry also 
deletes the person from the desktop or laptop computer version of the app. 
That’s because the list of contacts is maintained at a central location — an IM 
server, to be precise — and not on your BlackBerry.
	
Set up two accounts of your favorite IM application: one for your BlackBerry 
and one for your desktop PC. By using these accounts separately, you can 
limit the number of contacts you have on your BlackBerry and still maintain a 
full-blown list of contacts on your desktop.
SMS versus connecting via the Web
	
SMS messages are short messages designed for cellphones. IM is a step up, 
evolving from the Internet, where bandwidth is no longer a concern. IM pro­
vides a better real-time conversation experience across distances. These two 
technologies evolved in parallel. As more people use IM, it becomes appar­
ent that this technology has a place in smart phones, in which mobility is an 
advantage. Some of the IM programs used in the BlackBerry in the past use 
SMS behind the scenes. And because your BlackBerry can connect to the 
Internet, other programs use the Internet directly. These differences can affect 
your monthly bill as well as your messaging experience. Read on.
	
If you don’t have unlimited SMS but have an unlimited data plan, be careful with 
any third-party IM software. Make sure that it uses the Internet instead of SMS. 
If it uses SMS, you’ll incur charges for every message sent and received. Most 
network providers charge 20 cents for every SMS message, which can add up 
quickly and lead to a nasty surprise on your monthly bill.

I
n Chapter 8, you find a slew of ways to send messages on your BlackBerry 
Storm. In this chapter, you get the scoop on another way to send mes­
sages, using a special application known and loved by BlackBerry.
RIM has entered the IM (instant message) horse race in the form of a spirited 
filly named (you guessed it) BlackBerry Messenger. This application is based 
on the PIN-to-PIN messaging technology (refer to Chapter 8), which means 
that it is mucho fast and quite reliable.
	
However, with BlackBerry Messenger, you can chat with only those buddies 
who have a BlackBerry and also have PIN-to-PIN messaging enabled. The 
application supports IM features common to many other applications, such 
as group chatting and the capability to monitor the availability of other IM 
buddies.

144
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
Accessing BlackBerry Messenger
You access BlackBerry Messenger in the Applications folder from the Home 
screen, as shown in Figure 9-1. The first time you run BlackBerry Messenger, 
a welcome screen asks you to enter your display name. This display name is 
the one you want other people see in BlackBerry Messenger when you send 
them a message.
	
Figure 9-1: 
Launch 
BlackBerry 
Messenger 
here.
	
Using BlackBerry Messenger
The next time you open BlackBerry Messenger, you see a contacts list, as 
shown on the left in Figure 9-2. (Okay, the picture here displays some con­
tacts, but your list should be empty; we’ll show you how to populate the list 
in a minute.)
	
Consider this a friendly warning rather than a tip. After you have BlackBerry 
Messenger in your life, it’s difficult to live without it. Because it’s always con­
nected and you can see when messages have been successfully delivered and 
read, it’s the ultimate form of text-based communication.

Pressing the menu key lets you do the following, as shown on the right side 
of Figure 9-2:
	
✓	Broadcast Message: Send a message to multiple contacts in your 
BlackBerry Messenger. The messages appear as conversations in the 
recipients’ BlackBerry Messenger.
	
✓	Start Chat: Initiate a conversation with the currently highlighted 
contact.
	
✓	Invite To Conference: Initiate a group conversation. See the later 
section “Starting a group conversation” for details.
	
✓	Forward to Messenger Contact: Send the currently highlighted contact 
information to your other BlackBerry Messenger contacts.
	
✓	Invite Contact: Add a new contact to BlackBerry Messenger. See the 
next section.
	
✓	Add Category: Create custom groupings within your BlackBerry 
Messenger.
	
✓	Contact Profile: Display a screen showing the information of the 
currently highlighted contact.

Finger-scroll down the menu screen to see the following:
	
✓	My Profile: Customize your personal information and control how you 
want others to see you from their BlackBerry Messenger contacts list. 
You can set the following (see Figure 9-3):
 
• Change your picture. Simply tap the default image, navigate to 
your picture, finger-scroll the picture to center your face in the 
square, press the menu key, and then touch-press Crop and Save.
 
• Change your display name.
 
• Allow others to see the title of the song you’re currently 
listening to.
 
• Allow others to see that you’re currently using the phone.
 
• Enter a personal message that others can see.

✓	Options: Customize the behavior of your BlackBerry Messenger.
	
✓	Back Up Contacts List: Save your list of BlackBerry Messenger contacts 
to the file system. The location defaults to the media card, but the 
screen that follows after you touch-press this option allows you to select 
a different folder and enter a different name for the backup file.
	
✓	Restore Contacts List: Restore your list of BlackBerry Messenger contacts 
from the file you created from the Back Up Contacts List.
	
✓	Delete Backup Files: Delete a backup file. If you have multiple backups, 
this option allows you to choose which file to delete.
	
✓	Add New Group: Create custom groupings for your contacts.
	
	This option is helpful if you have a lot of contacts in BlackBerry 
Messenger. Simply touch-press this menu item, and an Add Group 
screen appears so you can enter a group name.
	
✓	Scan a Group Barcode: Add members to the open group by scanning 
your friend’s BlackBerry barcode.
Adding a Contact
With no one in your contacts list, BlackBerry Messenger is a pretty useless 
item. Your first order of business is to add a contact to your list — someone 
you know who
	
✓	Has a BlackBerry
	
✓	Is entered in your contacts list
	
✓	Has PIN-to-PIN messaging enabled
	
✓	Has a copy of BlackBerry Messenger installed on his or her device
If you know someone who fits these criteria, you can add that person to your 
list by doing the following:
	
1.	In BlackBerry Messenger, press the menu key.
	
2.	Touch-press Add a Contact.
	
	 The screen on the left side of Figure 9-4 appears, listing actions related 
to adding a contact. The top two options are the ones you use to add a 
contact to BlackBerry Messenger.

touch-press the third option, which says Show Your Invitation 
Barcode to Another BlackBerry.
	
	A barcode image similar to the right side of Figure 9-4 appears on 
your friend’s BlackBerry.
	
b.	On your BlackBerry Storm, touch-press the second option, Scan 
Invitation Barcode from Another BlackBerry.
	
	A Camera application appears for you to capture the barcode. 
Once captured, the contact information is immediately added to 
your BlackBerry Messenger contacts list.
	
	 That’s it. You’re finished. The following steps show how to enter your 
contact directly from the Add Contact screen.

a.	Touch-press Enter a Person’s Email Address, PIN, or Name.
	
	The Invite Contact screen appears.
	
b.	Start typing the name of the contact, and when a list of the pos­
sible contacts appears, touch-press the name you want to add.
	
	BlackBerry sends the request to the potential contact with the 
message you see in Figure 9-5. You can edit this message.

	The application sends your request. As long as the person hasn’t 
responded to your request, his or her name appears as part of 
the Pending group, as shown in Figure 9-6. When your contact 
responds positively to your request, the name goes to the official 
contacts list.

Having Conversations
You come to this point because what you really want to do is chat with your 
friends with BlackBerry Messenger. The short sections here give you a quick 
rundown on starting individual or group conversations. We also throw in 
some steps on sharing files and saving your conversation history.
Starting a conversation
You can easily start a conversation with any of your contacts. Follow these 
steps:
	
1.	On the BlackBerry Messenger main menu, touch-press the name in 
your contacts list.
	
	 A traditional chat interface opens, with a list of old messages at the top 
and a text box for typing messages at the bottom.
	
2.	Type your message.
	
3.	Touch-press the enter key.
	
	 Any messages you send (as well as any responses you get) are appended 
to the history list at the top.
Starting a group conversation
You can also invite others to your BlackBerry Messenger conversation. 
Follow these steps:
	
1.	During a conversation, press the menu key.
	
	 The BlackBerry Messenger main menu appears. This time, an Invite 
option has been added.
	
2.	Touch-press Invite to Group Chat.
	
	 The Select Contacts screen opens, listing your BlackBerry Messenger 
contacts who are currently available (see Figure 9-7).
	
3.	Invite people to the chat by touch-pressing the corresponding check 
boxes.
	
	 You can choose any number of people.

151
 Chapter 9: Instant Messaging
	
4.	Touch-press OK.
	
	 You’re back to the preceding conversation screen, but this time the 
history list shows the contacts you added to the conversation. The 
newly selected contact(s) can now join the conversation.
	
Figure 9-7: 
See your 
available 
contacts 
here.
	
You can set a subject on your message. This is especially useful for group 
conversations:
	
1.	Press the menu key while you’re in the conversation screen and then 
touch-press Set Subject.
	
	 On the screen that follows, the cursor is in the subject line, waiting for 
you to enter a subject (see Figure 9-8)
	
2.	Enter the subject and then touch-press OK.
	
	 The conversation screen is updated with the subject.

You can make your name appear snazzy by adding symbols, such as DanteJ 
and YosmaC (see Figure 9-9):
 
1. On the BlackBerry Messenger screen, press the menu key.
 
2. Touch-press Edit My Info.
 
3. Press the menu key and touch-press Add Smiley to choose the symbol 
you want.
 
Figure 9-9: 
Add 
symbols

name here.
 
Sending a file
BlackBerry Messenger, like any other instant messaging application, can send 
files. While on a conversation, just press the menu key, and you’ll see several 
menu items allowing you to share a file:
 
✓ Send Picture: Displays a screen similar to the left side of Figure 9-10, 
where you can either launch the Camera application to take a picture 
to send or select the picture file you want to send (you can navigate to 
a specific folder if necessary). The default location for picture files is 
the Media Card pictures folder. Just touch-press Camera to launch the 
Camera application.
 
✓ Send Voice Note: Displays the Voice Note screen (see Figure 9-10, right), 
where you can record the voice message you want to send. When you’re 
ready to record, follow these steps:
 
a. Touch-press Start.
 
 The Storm is ready to record your voice message. A screen indicat-
ing recording appears with a Stop button, as shown on the left side 
of Figure 9-11.

153
 Chapter 9: Instant Messaging
	
b.	When you have finished speaking your message, touch-press 
Stop.
	
	A screen similar to the right side of Figure 9-11 appears. You can 
play the message to review what you said, send the message if 
you’re satisfied, or cancel sending a voice note.

154
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
	
c.	Touch-press Send.
	
	You see a prompt asking you to add a description of your voice 
message. Touch-pressing No sends the message right away. In this 
case, you want to describe this message.
	
d.	Touch-press Yes.
	
	An Add File Description screen appears.
	
e.	Enter a description and then touch-press OK.
	
	A request to transfer the file is sent, and your friend needs to 
accept it in his or her BlackBerry Messenger for the transmission 
to begin.
	
✓	Send File: Displays a screen that lists which file types you can send. 
Aside from giving you a different way of sending pictures and voice mes­
sages, the screen lists the following types:
 
• File: Sends any type of file. When touch-pressed, it shows an 
Explorer-type screen so you can navigate to the file you want 
to send. The default folders shown are Media Card and Device 
Memory.
 
• BlackBerry Contact: Sends a vCard (see Chapter 4 for details on 
the vCard). When touch-pressed, it displays Contacts, allowing you 
to select the contact you want to send.
 
• Messenger Contact: Lets you choose a name from your list of 
BlackBerry Messenger contacts and send the info as a file.
Saving the conversation history
While you are in the conversation screen, you can save your chat history in 
two ways. Both methods are accessible by a simple press of the menu key:
	
✓	Copy History: Copies the existing chat history to the Clipboard. Then 
you just need to paste it into the application where you want it saved, 
such as Calendar or MemoPad.
	
✓	Email History: Displays the Compose Message screen, shown in 
Figure 9-12, with the Subject field prepopulated with Chat with 
<Contact> on <Date> and the body of the message prepopulated 
with the chat history.

155
 Chapter 9: Instant Messaging

Broadcasting a Message
Do you feel the need to start a conversation on the same subject with several 
people? You can start with a group chat, but what if you want to get a per­
sonal opinion from each individual, something that each person isn’t com­
fortable saying in front of the crowd? The best way to do this is to broadcast 
a message to multiple recipients, as follows:
	
1.	On the BlackBerry Messenger screen, press the menu key.
	
2.	Touch-press Broadcast Message.
	
	 The Broadcast Message screen appears, as shown in Figure 9-13, allow­
ing you to enter your message and select the recipients.
	
3.	Enter your message.
	
4.	Touch-press the recipients.
	
5.	Touch-press Send.

Surfing the Internet Wave
In This Chapter
▶	Using the Browser to surf the Web
▶	Creating and organizing bookmarks
▶	Customizing and optimizing Browser
▶	Downloading and installing applications from the Web
▶	Using Browser in businesses
W
eb surfing is becoming a necessity and part of our daily existence. 
Nearly everyone can surf the Web any time and anywhere from a 
desktop computer, a netbook, or even a tiny mobile device such as a PDA 
or a smart phone. And having said that, it should be no surprise that your 
BlackBerry Storm has a Web browser of its own.
In this chapter, we show you how to use the Browser. We give you shortcuts 
and timesaving tips, including the coolest ways to make pages load faster, as 
well as a complete neat-freak’s guide to managing your bookmarks.
And because your network service provider may have its own custom 
browser for you to use, we compare these proprietary browsers with the 
default Browser so you can decide which best suits your needs.
Kicking Up Browser
The BlackBerry Browser comes loaded on your smart phone and accesses 
the Web via a cellphone connection. Browser can be named differently, 
depending on how the service provider customizes it. Sometimes it’s named 
BlackBerry Browser, Internet Browser, or (most likely) just Browser. We just 
use Browser to make things easier.

158
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
Browser has multiple personalities:
	
✓	One that’s connected to your company’s BlackBerry Enterprise 
Server: BlackBerry Enterprise Server is a software application from RIM 
(Research In Motion) that companies can use to control and manage 
BlackBerry devices. The software also allows your device to see your 
company’s network and connects to your company’s databases.
	
	If you’re a corporate BlackBerry user, your company administrator may 
turn off or not install other browsers except for the one that connects 
through the company’s BlackBerry Enterprise Server.
	
✓	One that goes directly to your service provider’s network: This might 
be called by the network service provider’s brand name.
	
✓	One that uses a Wi-Fi connection: This personality applies if you have 
Storm2.
	
✓	A WAP browser: Wireless application protocol, or WAP, was popular in 
the 1990s, when mobile device displays were very limited and could dis­
play only five or six rows of text. WAP lost its appeal with the advent of 
high-resolution screens.
The following sections get you started using Browser. After you get your feet 
wet, we promise that you’ll be chomping at the bit to find out more!
	
In today’s competitive smart phone game, the Web browsing experience is 
one of the core functions upon which a platform and device are judged. And 
by RIM’s own admission, this is an area that RIM is working feverishly to 
improve. RIM’s recent acquisition of Torch Mobile, a WebKit-based third-party 
browser (the iPhone’s Safari browser is based on the WebKit browser engine) 
shows that RIM is serious. In the meantime, be sure to check out Bolt Browser 
(Boltbrowser.com) and Opera Mini 5 (m.opera.com). Both have loyal fol­
lowings among CrackBerry readers. SkyFire, another popular third-party Web 
browser, is currently under a private beta release. Private beta means that the 
app is available to a lucky few individuals, but keep tuning in to our blogs at 
www.crackberry.com; we’ll let you know when SkyFire becomes available 
for you to download. If you’re not satisfied with Browser, give these third-
party options a try!
Getting to Browser
Browser is one of the main applications of your device, with its globe icon 
visible right on the Home screen, as shown in Figure 10-1. Touch-press this 
icon to open Browser.

159
 Chapter 10: Surfing the Internet Wave
	
Figure 10-1: 
You can 
open 
Browser 
from the 
Home 
screen.
	
	
If Browser is your default browser, you can access it from any application 
that distinguishes a Web address. For example, from Contacts, you can open 
Browser by opening the link on the Web Page field. If you get an e-mail that 
contains a Web address, just tap that link, press the menu key, and touch-
press Open Link.
	
When you want to access Browser from another application, you don’t have to 
close that application to jump to Browser. Just press the menu key and touch-
press Switch Application, which opens a pop-up screen with application icons. 
Touch-press the Browser icon to launch Browser.
By default, accessing Browser by touch-pressing a Web link within another 
application opens the Web page associated with that address. For example, 
in Figure 10-2, we’re opening Browser from the Messages application.
	
Figure 10-2: 
Open 
Browser 
from 
Messages.
	

160
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
Opening Browser by touch-pressing its icon on the Home screen gives you a 
start page similar to Figure 10-3, which list the latest Web sites you’ve visited. 
It also shows a Bookmarks link. You find out more about adding bookmarks 
later in this chapter.
	
Figure 10-3: 
Browser 
with the 
default 
empty 
Bookmarks 
screen.
	
Hitting the (air) waves
After you locate Browser, you’re ready to surf the Web. Here’s how:
	
1.	Open Browser.
	
	 Unless the configuration is changed, BlackBerry Storm displays a default 
start page when you open Browser (refer to Figure 10-3, earlier in this 
chapter). This page allows you enter a Web address. If you have not 
changed the start page (see the “Configuring Browser” section to cus­
tomize the start page), skip to Step 3.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then touch-press Go To.
	
3.	Type a Web address, as shown in Figure 10-4.
	
4.	Touch-press Go.
	
	 The Web page begins to load; the progress is indicated at the bottom of 
the screen.
Unless you change Browser’s configuration (see the “Configuring Browser” 
section, later in this chapter), BlackBerry displays your bookmarks when you 
open Browser. And if you already have bookmarks, just press the menu key 
and then touch-press Go To. For the lowdown on adding bookmarks, see the 
upcoming section “Bookmarking Your Favorite Sites.”

161
 Chapter 10: Surfing the Internet Wave
	
Figure 10-4: 
Opening a 
Web page is 
simple.
	
	
When you see a phone number or an e-mail address on a Web page, you can 
touch-press that information to initiate a phone call or open a new e-mail mes­
sage, respectively.
Navigating Web pages
Using Browser to navigate to a Web page is easy. Note that hyperlinks are 
highlighted onscreen. To jump to a particular hyperlink, touch-press the link.
Here are a few shortcuts you can use while navigating a Web page:
	
✓	Move up and down one full display page at a time. Press 9 (down 
arrow) or 3 (up arrow).
	
✓	Stop loading a page. Press the escape key (the bottom arrow key).
	
✓	Go back to the previous page (if there is one). Press the escape key 
(the bottom arrow key).
And don’t forget the Browser menu (press the menu key). It has some useful 
shortcuts, as shown in Figure 10-5.
Here are the Browser menu options:
	
✓	Help: Displays a quick guide.
	
✓	Page View: Appears only if you are in Column view. (See the upcoming 
bullet.) This view allows you to see the page as you typically would on 
a PC’s Internet browser. The compressed version of the Web page takes 
up the entire screen first.

162
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
	
✓	Column View: Appears only if you are in Page view. With Column view, 
which is the default view, the Web page is displayed vertically. A wide 
Web page wraps down, so you must finger-scroll to see more of the page.
	
✓	Zoom In/Zoom Out: Zooms in and out, respectively.
	
✓	Find: Locates and highlights text on the current page. As with any other 
basic Find tool, choosing this option displays a prompt to enter the text 
you want to find. After the initial search, a Find Next menu appears for 
finding the next matching text.
	
✓	Select: Appears only if you tapped text. Use this feature to highlight text 
onscreen for copying.
	
✓	Stop: Appears only if you’re in the middle of requesting a page. Use Stop 
to cancel such a request. This is the same as pressing the escape key.
	
✓	Copy: Appears if you have highlighted text. Touch-pressing Copy copies 
the highlighted text into memory so that you can use it later for pasting 
somewhere else, such as in MemoPad.
	
✓	Full Image: Appears only if you highlight an image and only a portion of 
the image is displayed onscreen.
	
✓	Save Image: Appears only if you highlight an image, allowing you to save 
the image in built-in memory or to an microSD card.
	
✓	Home: Represents the shortcut to your home page. To change the default 
home page (which can vary from carrier to carrier), follow these steps:
	
a.	Open the Browser menu.
	
b.	Choose Options➪Browser Configuration.
	
c.	Change the Home Page Address field.
	
Figure 10-5: 
The 
Browser 
menu has 
lots of good 
stuff.
	

163
 Chapter 10: Surfing the Internet Wave
	
✓	Get Link: Appears if you have a highlighted link. Choosing this menu 
item opens that page of the link.
	
✓	Go To: Opens a Web page when you enter a Web address and touch-press 
Go. As you enter more addresses, they are listed in the History portion of 
the screen so you don’t have to retype them. To find out how to clear that 
list, see the “Specifying cache operations” section, later in this chapter.
	
✓	Back: Goes back to the preceding page you viewed. This menu item 
appears only if you have navigated to more than one Web page.
	
	You can achieve the same function by pressing the escape key (the 
bottom arrow key).
	
✓	Forward: Progresses one page at a time if you’ve gone back at least one 
Web page in your browsing travels; otherwise, it isn’t a visible option.
	
✓	Recent Pages: Jumps to any of those Web pages when you highlight 
the history page and press the enter key twice. Browser can track up to 
20 pages of Web addresses you’ve visited, which you can view on the 
History screen.
	
✓	History: Displays a list of the Web pages you’ve visited and allows you 
to jump back quickly to those pages. The list is grouped by date.
	
✓	Refresh: Updates the current page. This is helpful when you’re viewing a 
page with data that changes frequently (such as stock quotes).
	
✓	Set Encoding: Specifies the encoding used in viewing a Web page. This is 
useful for viewing foreign languages that use different characters. Most 
BlackBerry users don’t have to deal with this and probably don’t know 
what type of encoding a particular language could display.
When you try to open a Web page, indicators that show the progress of your 
request appear at the bottom of the screen. The left side of Figure 10-6 shows 
that Browser is requesting a page; the right side of the figure shows that 
you’ve reached the page but the page is still loading.
	
Figure 10-6: 
Requesting 
a page (left) 
and then 
loading it 
(right).
	

164
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
The icons in the top-right corners of both screens in Figure 10-6 are as fol­
lows, from right to left:
	
✓	The bars show the strength of the network signals (the same signal indi­
cators for phone and e-mail).
	
✓	Your connection type also appears. In Figure 10-6, 3G means that the 
connection is using the third-generation network.
	
✓	The lock icon indicates whether you’re on a secure Web page. Figure 10-6 
shows a nonsecure page. Whether a page is secure depends on the Web 
site you’re visiting. If you’re accessing your bank, you most likely see the 
secured icon (a closed lock). On the other hand, most pages don’t need 
to be secure, so you see the unsecured icon (an open lock).
	
If you lose patience waiting for a page to load and want to browse somewhere 
else, press the escape key (the arrow key at the bottom of your Storm) to stop 
the page from loading.
Saving a Web page address
Entering a Web address to view a page can get tedious. Fortunately, you can 
return to a page without typing the same address. While you’re viewing a 
Web page, simply use the Browser menu (shown in Figure 10-7) to save that 
page’s address.
You can save a Web page address in a couple of ways:
	
✓	Page Address: Allows you to view the Web address of the current page 
through a pop-up screen, which presents you with two options to act on:
 
• Copy Address saves the page’s address on your BlackBerry 
Clipboard and allows you to paste it somewhere else.
 
• Send Address is the same Send Address you see in the Browser 
menu (as described in the next item).
	
✓	Send Address: Presents another screen so that you can choose whether 
to send the address by
 
• E-mail (Chapter 8)
 
• PIN (Chapter 8)
 
• SMS text (Chapter 8)
 
• MMS (Chapter 8)
 
• Messenger Contact (Chapter 9)
	
✓	Options: Displays a screen allowing you to customize the behavior 
of Browser. See the section “Exercising Options and Optimization 
Techniques,” later in this chapter, for details.

165
 Chapter 10: Surfing the Internet Wave
	
✓	Save Page: Saves the Web address of the current page to Messages. A 
message appears with the Browser globe icon to indicate that the mes­
sage is a Web link, as shown in Figure 10-8. Touch-press that entry to 
launch Browser and open the page for your viewing pleasure.
	
	Saving a page to your message list has a different purpose from book­
marking a page. The page initially appears as unread in Messages to 
remind you to check back later.
Note: When you don’t have network coverage, and you try to access a Web 
page, you’re prompted to save your request. When you do, your request is 
automatically saved in the message list. When you do have coverage later, 
you can open the same Web page from the message list, with the content 
loaded already!

Browser 
menu to

166
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
Sending an address by e-mail
You can send a Web address to any recipient via an e-mail message by using 
the Page Address option on the Browser menu. For a more direct way, simply 
touch-press Send Address on the Browser menu while the Web page is dis­
played. If you know right away that you’ll need to send an address to some­
one, save a few clicks and use the more-direct method.
Saving Web images
You can save images in JPEG, PNG, GIF, and BMP formats from a Web page. 
Any saved image is kept in the Pictures application, which enables you to 
view it later. To save an image, just tap the image, press the menu key, and 
then touch-press Save Image on the menu that appears.
Bookmarking Your Favorite Sites
You don’t have to memorize all the addresses of your favorite sites. Instead, 
use BlackBerry Browser to keep a list of sites you want to revisit. In other 
words, make a bookmark so that you can come back to a site quickly.
Adding and visiting a bookmark
Add a new bookmark this way:
	
1.	Open Browser and go to the Web page you want to bookmark.
No place like Home
Changing your Home screen background is 
a neat trick. You can use an image you have 
saved in your Pictures list as the background 
on your Home screen. Here’s how:
	 1.	 From the Home screen, touch-press the 
Media icon and then touch-press Pictures.
	
	 The Pictures application opens.
	 2.	 Finger-scroll to and touch-press the image 
you want to set as your background.
	 3.	 Press the menu key and then touch-press 
Set As.
	 4.	 Touch-press Wallpaper.

167
 Chapter 10: Surfing the Internet Wave
	
2.	Touch-press Add Bookmark from the Browser menu.
	
	 The menu is always accessible by pressing the menu key.
	
3.	(Optional) In the Add Bookmark dialog box, change the bookmark name.
	
	 The name of the bookmark defaults to the Web-site title and, in most 
cases, is appropriate to use as the name. You always have the option 
to change this name; refer to the following section, “Modifying a 
bookmark.”
	
4.	In the Add Bookmark dialog box, navigate to the folder where you 
want to save the bookmark.
	
	 The dialog box is shown in Figure 10-9. The default bookmark save folder 
is BlackBerry Bookmarks, but you can save the bookmark in any folder 
you create. To see how to create a bookmark folder, skip to the section 
“Adding a bookmark subfolder,” later in this chapter.
	
5.	Touch-press Add.
	
Figure 10-9: 
Name the 
bookmark 
and specify 
where to 
store it.
	
Here’s how to go to a bookmarked page:
	
1.	In Browser, touch-press Bookmarks on the Browser menu.
	
	 You’re taken to the Bookmarks screen. From here, you can find all the 
pages you bookmarked.
	
2.	Touch-press the bookmark for the page you want to visit.

168
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
Modifying a bookmark
You have the option of changing the attributes of existing bookmarks. Why 
change them? Say you bookmarked a couple of pages from the same Web 
site, but the author of the Web pages didn’t bother to have a unique title for 
each page. While happily bookmarking pages, you didn’t bother to change 
the names of the bookmarks that default to the Web-page title. Now you end 
up with several bookmarks with the same name.
Changing a bookmark is a snap. Follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Bookmarks screen (touch-press Bookmarks on the Browser 
menu), tap the name of the bookmark you want to modify, press the 
menu key, and then touch-press Edit Bookmark.
	
2.	On the screen that follows, edit the existing name, the address the 
bookmark is pointing to, or both.
	
3.	Touch-press Save to save your changes.
Organizing your bookmarks
Over time, the number of your bookmarks will grow, and trying to find a certain 
site on a tiny screen can be tough. A handy work-around is to organize your 
bookmarks with folders. For example, you can group related sites in a folder, and 
each folder can have one or more other folders inside it (subfolders). Having a 
folder hierarchy narrows your search and allows you to easily find a site.
For example, your sites might fall into these categories:
	
✓	Reference
	
	NY Times
	
	Yahoo!
Available offline
The Add Bookmark dialog box has an Available 
Offline check box. When that check box is 
selected, you not only save a page as a book­
mark, but also cache it so you can see it even 
when you’re out of range (like when you’re 
stuck deep in a mountain cave). The next time 
you click the bookmark, that page comes up 
quickly. This offline feature comes in handy 
when you’re pulling articles on the way to the 
subway or the street-by-street directions you 
got from maps.google.com.

Adding a bookmark subfolder
You can add subfolders only to folders that are already listed on the 
Bookmarks page. That is, you can’t create your own root folder. Your choices 
for adding your first subfolder are under WAP Bookmarks or BlackBerry 
Bookmarks.
Suppose you want to add a Reference subfolder within your BlackBerry 
Bookmarks folder. Here are the quick and easy steps:
	
1.	On the Bookmarks screen, tap BlackBerry Bookmarks.
	
	 This is the parent of the new subfolder. In this case, the BlackBerry 
Bookmarks folder will contain the Reference subfolder.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then touch-press Add Subfolder, as shown in 
Figure 10-10.
	
	 You see a dialog box where you can enter the name of the folder. (We’re 
using Reference.)
	
Figure 10-10: 
Add a folder

3.	Type the folder name and touch-press OK.
	
	 The Reference folder now appears on the Bookmarks screen (as shown 
in Figure 10-11), bearing a folder icon.

Renaming a bookmark folder
Although you can’t rename the root bookmark folders, such as BlackBerry 
Bookmarks and WAP Bookmarks, the folders you create under them are fair 
game. Renaming a bookmark folder that you created is as easy as editing a 
bookmark. Follow these steps:
	
1.	On the Bookmarks screen, highlight the name of the folder you want 
to change.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Rename Folder.
	
3.	Type the name of the folder.
	
4.	Touch-press OK to save your changes.
Moving a bookmark
If you keep going astray looking for a bookmark that you think exists in a par­
ticular folder but is instead in another, move that bookmark where it belongs. 
Follow these steps:
	
1.	Tap the bookmark, press the menu key, and touch-press Move 
Bookmark.
	
2.	Touch-press the folder where you want this bookmark moved.
	
	 Your bookmark is in its new home.
Cleaning up your bookmarks
Maybe you really like a site but eventually stop visiting it. Or maybe a site 
disappears, and every time you click the bookmark, you get a 404 Not Found 
error. Time for a little spring cleaning. From the Bookmarks screen, tap the 

171
 Chapter 10: Surfing the Internet Wave
name of the bookmark you want to delete, press the menu key, and touch-
press Delete Bookmark. It’s just that easy.
	
You can — repeat, can — clean up bookmarks wholesale by deleting a folder. 
A word to the wise, though: All the contents of that folder will be deleted, so 
purge with caution.
Exercising Options and Optimization 
Techniques
Sure, Browser works out of the box, but folks have their own taste, right? 
Look to Browser Options for attributes and features you can customize.
Press the menu key and touch-press Options. The Browser Options screen 
offers four main categories to choose among, as shown in Figure 10-12:
	
✓	Browser Configuration: A place to toggle Browser features
	
✓	General Properties: Settings for the general look and feel of Browser
	
✓	Cache Operations: An area for clearing file caches used by Browser
	
✓	Gears Settings: A place to enable certain Web sites that take advantage 
of Gears

If you feel speed-greedy after adjusting the options, see the “Speeding up 
browsing” sidebar, later in this chapter.

172
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
Configuring Browser
You can define browser-specific settings from the Browser Configuration 
screen, which you access from the Browser Options screen. The customiza­
tion items you can amend (shown in Figure 10-13) are as follows:
	
✓	Support JavaScript: JavaScript is a scripting language used heavily to 
make dynamic Web pages. A Web page might not behave normally when 
this option is turned off. This option is on by default.
	
✓	Allow JavaScript Popups: Most ad pages are launched as JavaScript 
pop-ups, so selecting this check box minimizes these ads. Be aware, 
though, that some important pages are also displayed as JavaScript pop-
ups. Note: This option appears only if you select the Support JavaScript 
check box.
	
✓	Prompt to Enable JavaScript Popups: This option appears and comes 
into play only if you do not select the Support JavaScript option. The 
default value for this option is selected (if you browse a page that has 
JavaScript, Browser will prompt you to either enable JavaScript or not).
	
✓	Terminate Slow Running Scripts: Sometimes, you find Web pages 
with scripts that aren’t written well. If you select this option, you keep 
Browser from hanging. This option appears only if you select the 
Support JavaScript check box.
	
✓	Show Images: This option controls the display of images depending on 
the content mode of WML, HTML, or both. Think of WML pages as Web 
pages made just for mobile devices, such as the BlackBerry. We recom­
mend leaving this option selected for both.
	
Figure 10-13: 
The 
Browser 
Config­
uration 
screen.
	

173
 Chapter 10: Surfing the Internet Wave
	
	Turn on and off the display of image placeholders if you opt to not dis­
play images.
	
✓	Use Background Images: A Web-page background image can make the page 
look pleasing, but if the image is big, it could take time to download it.
	
✓	Support Embedded Media: Touch-press this option to support media 
such as SVG (scalable vector graphics). Think of SVG as Adobe Flash for 
mobile devices such as the BlackBerry Storm. SVG can be a still image or 
an animated one.
	
✓	Browser Identification: This option specifies which browser type your 
browser emulates. The default is BlackBerry, but Browser can also emu­
late Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox.
	
	Keep the default BlackBerry mode. We don’t see much difference among 
the modes.
	
✓	Start Page: Use this option to specify a starting page to load when you 
open Browser. You can choose Start Page (the default start page); Home 
Page, which you set with the next option; and Last Page Loaded.
	
✓	Default Search Provider: Allows you to choose Google (the default), 
Live Search, Wikipedia, or Dictionary.com as the default Web site to use 
in the search function you see in the Browser initial screen.
	
✓	Home Page Address: Use this option to set your home page. Note that 
the home page is always available from the Browser menu.
Setting general Browser properties
The General Properties screen is similar to the Browser Configuration screen 
(see the preceding section) in that you can customize some Browser behav­
iors. General Properties, however, is geared more toward the features of 
Browser content, as shown in Figure 10-14. You can configure features and 
also turn features off or on.
From this screen, use the space key to change the value of a field. You can 
configure the following features:
	
✓	Default Browser: If you have multiple browsers available, use this to 
specify which one you want to use when opening a Web link.
	
✓	Default Font Family: When a Web page doesn’t specify the text font, 
Browser will use the one you selected here.
	
✓	Default Font Size: When a Web page doesn’t specify the text font size, 
Browser uses the one you select here. The smaller the size, the more 
text can fit onscreen.
	
✓	Minimum Font Size: A Web page might specify a font size too small to 
be legible. Specifying a legible font size will override the Web page.

174
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
	
✓	Minimum Font Style: When Browser is using the minimum font size, you 
can choose what font to use. Some fonts, even in a small size, are more 
legible than others. If you aren’t sure which one to use, leave the default.
	
✓	Default View: You can toggle the default view. Column wraps all Web 
page elements vertically, so you just finger-scroll up and down the 
page. Page displays the page like you normally see in your PC’s Internet 
browser. Finger-scroll the pages left, right, up, and down.
	
✓	Image Quality: The higher the quality, the slower the page loads. You 
have three options: low, medium (the default), and high.
	
✓	Repeat Animations: This option sets the number of times an animation 
repeats. This pertains to the animated images that most banner ads use. 
Your choices are Never, Once, 10 Times, 100 Times (the default), and As 
Many as the Image Specifies.
	
✓	Full Screen View: This option displays the Web page full screen. The 
default is off, which allows you to finger-scroll.
	
✓	Enable JavaScript Location Support: Web pages that have scripts that 
take advantage of your BlackBerry’s location through GPS will work if 
you select this option.
	
✓	Prompt Before: You can have BlackBerry Browser give you a second 
chance before you do the following things:
 
• Closing Browser on Escape: You’re notified right before you exit 
BlackBerry Browser.
 
• Closing Modified Pages: You’re notified right before you exit a modi­
fied Web page (for example, some type of online form you fill out).
 
• Running WML Scripts: WML is a script that tells a wireless device 
how to display a page. It was popular years ago, when resolutions 
of device screens were low, but very few Web sites use it now. We 
recommend leaving this field deselected.
Specifying cache operations
	
At any given time, your BlackBerry uses a few cache mechanisms. A cache (pro­
nounced cash) temporarily stores information used by Browser so that the next 
time the info is needed, Browser doesn’t have to go back to the source Web site. 
The cache can speed displays when you want to view the Web page again and is 
also useful when you’re suddenly out of network coverage. When you visit a site 
that uses cookies, Browser caches that cookie. (Think of a cookie as a piece of 
text that a Web site created and placed in your BlackBerry’s memory to remem­
ber something about you, such as your username.)
	
Browser also caches pages and content so that you can view them offline, 
which is handy when you’re out of network range.

175
 Chapter 10: Surfing the Internet Wave

Speeding up browsing
On a wireless network, many factors can affect 
how fast Web pages display. If you find that 
browsing the Web is extremely slow, you can 
make your pages load faster, but you lose the 
ability to take advantage of a few features. 
Here are some of the speed-enhancing work-
arounds you can use:
	✓	Don’t display images. You can achieve a 
big performance improvement by turning 
off image display. From the Browser menu, 
touch-press Browser Options, touch-press 
Browser Configuration, finger-scroll to 
Show Images, and change the value to No.
	✓	Check your BlackBerry memory. When 
your BlackBerry’s memory is depleted, its 
performance degrades. The BlackBerry 
low-memory manager calls each applica­
tion every now and then, telling each one 
to free resources.
	
	 Hint: Don’t leave many e-mail messages 
unread. When the low-memory manager 
kicks in, Messages tries to delete old mes­
sages, but it can’t delete unread messages.
	✓	Turn off other features. If you’re mostly 
interested in viewing content, consider 
turning off features that pertain to how 
the content is processed, such as Support 
HTML Tables, Use Background Images, 
Support JavaScript, Allow JavaScript 
Popups, and Support Style Sheets. To turn 
off other Browser features, touch-press 
Browser from the Home screen, press the 
menu key, touch-press Options, and then 
touch-press General Properties.
	
	 Warning: We don’t advise turning off fea­
tures while performing an important task 
such as online banking. If you do, you may 
not be able to perform some of the actions 
on the page. For example, the Submit button 
might not work. Not good.

176
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
	
Some Web sites push (send information) Web pages to BlackBerry devices. An 
icon will appear on the Home screen, allowing you to quickly view the page. 
After the Web page is delivered to your BlackBerry, the page becomes avail­
able even if you go out of the coverage area. If you subscribe to this service, 
your device will store Web pages in the cache. Also, the addresses of the 
pages that you visited (or your latest 20 in your history list) make up a cache.
The Cache Operations screen, shown in Figure 10-15, allows you to manually 
clear your cache. To view the Cache Operations screen, follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Browser screen, press the menu key.
	
2.	Touch-press Options.
	
3.	Touch-press Cache Operations.
The size of each type of cache is displayed on the Cache Operations screen. 
If the cache has content, you also see the Clear button, which you can use to 
clear the specified cache type. This is true for all types of caches except his­
tory, which has its own Clear History button. You find four types of caches:
	
✓	History: The list of sites you’ve visited by using the Go To function. You 
may want to clear this for the sake of security if you don’t want other 
people knowing which Web sites you’re visiting on your BlackBerry.
	
✓	Content Cache: Any offline content. You may want to clear this when­
ever you’re running out of space on your BlackBerry and need to free 
some memory. Or maybe you’re tired of viewing old content or tired of 
touch-pressing the Refresh option.
	
✓	Pushed Content: Any content that was pushed to your BlackBerry from 
Push Services subscriptions. You may want to clear this to free memory 
on your BlackBerry.
	
✓	Cookie Cache: Any cookies stored on your BlackBerry. You may want 
to clear this for security’s sake. Sometimes you don’t want a Web site to 
remember you.
Gears settings
Gears is a mechanism by which Browser sends your geographic location 
so that sites can provide location-based features catered to where you are. 
Gears is a relatively new technology initially developed by Google.
Some familiar Web applications such as Gmail, YouTube, and Picasa use 
Gears, but as of this writing, few Web sites take advantage of it. You will know 
whether a Web site uses Gears because Browser will prompt you for autho­
rization. After you authorize a Web site, it will be listed on the Gears Settings 
screen. To get to that screen, from the Browser screen, press the menu key, 
touch-press Options, and then touch-press Gear Settings.

Installing and Uninstalling 
Applications from the Web
You can download and install applications on your BlackBerry via Browser — 
that is, if the application has a link that lets you download and install the files 
(see Chapter 18 for other installation options). The downloading and install­
ing parts are easy. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Touch-press the link from Browser.
	
	 You see a simple prompt that looks like Figure 10-16.
	
2.	Touch-press the Download button.
	
	 The download starts.
As long as you stay within network coverage while the download is progressing, 
your BlackBerry can finish the download and install the application for you. If it 
finishes without any problems, you see a screen similar to Figure 10-17.
As with a desktop computer, the download might or might not work for a 
variety of reasons. Sometimes the application
	
✓	Requires you to install libraries
	
✓	Works only on a certain version of the BlackBerry OS

178

an applica-
tion to your 
BlackBerry.
	
	
Figure 10-17: 
The down-

installation 
are com-
plete.
	
These issues can be prevented, depending on the sophistication of the site 
where the link is published. With most reputable sources, these issues are 
considered, and successful downloading and installation are a snap.
	
Installing applications from nonreputable sources can cause your BlackBerry 
to become unstable. Before you download an application from the Web, be 
sure to read reviews about that particular application. Most of the time, other 
people who tried the software provide reviews or feedback. Don’t be the first 
to write the bad review! For reviews and feedback on third-party applications, 
you can visit www.crackberry.com.
	
Your BlackBerry Enterprise Server administrator can disable the feature 
in your BlackBerry to download and install an application. This is mostly 
the case for a company-issued device. If you have problems downloading 
and installing an application, check your company policy or contact the 
BlackBerry support person in your company.
If you download an application that turns out to be a dud, you need to uninstall 
it. See Chapter 18 for more on uninstalling an application from your BlackBerry.

 Chapter 10: Surfing the Internet Wave
Using Browser in Business
Getting a device from your employer has both a good and an ugly side:
	
✓	Good: Your company foots the bill.
	
✓	Ugly: Your company foots the bill.
Because your company pays, the company dictates what you can and cannot 
do with your BlackBerry Storm. This is especially true with respect to brows­
ing the Web.
Two scenarios come into play when it comes to your browser:
	
✓	Your browser might be running under your company’s BlackBerry 
Enterprise Server. With this setup, your BlackBerry Browser is connect­
ing to the Internet by using your company’s Internet connection. It’s like 
using your desktop machine at work.
	
✓	Your browser is connected through a network service provider. Most of 
the time, this kind of browser is called by the company’s name.
In most cases, your device fits in only one scenario, which is the case where 
your browser is connected through your company’s BlackBerry Enterprise 
Server server. Some lucky folks may have both. Whatever scenario you’re in, 
the following sections describe the major differences between the two and 
indicate what you can expect.
Using Browser on your company’s BlackBerry 
Enterprise Server server
In an enterprise setup, your BlackBerry Browser is connected through your 
company’s BlackBerry Enterprise Server server. With this setup, the browser 
is actually named BlackBerry Browser. BlackBerry Enterprise Server is located 
inside your company’s intranet. This setup allows the company to better 
manage the privileges and the functions you can use on your device.
For the BlackBerry Browser application, this setup allows the company to 
use the existing Internet infrastructure, including the company’s firewall. 
Because you are within the company’s network, the boundaries that your 
network administrator set up on your account apply to your BlackBerry as 
well. For example, when browsing the Web, your BlackBerry won’t display 
any Web sites that are blocked by your company’s server.
The good thing, though, is that you can browse the company’s intranet: That 
is, all the Web pages you have access to inside your company through your 
company’s PC are available also in your BlackBerry.

180
Part II: Getting Organized and Online with Your Storm 
	
Know (and respect) your company’s Web-browsing policy. Most companies 
keep logs of sites you view on your browser and might even have software to 
monitor usage. Also, your company might not allow downloading from the Web.
Using your network provider’s browser
Any new device coming from a network service provider can come with its 
own branded Web browser. It’s the same BlackBerry Browser, but the behav­
ior might differ in the following ways:
	
✓	The name is different.
	
✓	The default home page usually points to the provider’s Web site. This 
isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Most of the time, the network provider’s 
Web site is full of links that you may not find on BlackBerry Browser.
	
✓	You can browse more sites. You aren’t limited by your company’s policy.
Setting the default browser
If you have two Web browsers on your Storm, you have the option to set the 
default browser. This comes into play when you view a Web address by using 
a link outside the Browser application. For example, when you view an e-mail 
with a Web link, touch-pressing that link launches the default browser.
To set up the default browser, follow these steps:
	
1.	Go to the Home screen.
	
2.	Touch-press Options and then touch-press Advanced Options.
	
3.	Touch-press Browser.
	
4.	Touch-press the value of the default browser configuration and then 
touch-press one of the possible values, as shown in Figure 10-18.

In this part . . .
F
ind out how to use your BlackBerry Storm as a still 
camera and a video camera. You can also get enter­
tained and have fun with the Storm’s multimedia capabili­
ties. Get directions from the BlackBerry GPS. And finally, 
make those all-important phone calls.

▶	Saving and organizing your pictures
▶	Sharing your photos with other people
O
h, shoot, you forgot your camera. Don’t worry! Your Storm’s there 
when you need to capture the unbelievable: Grandma’s doing a hand­
stand, your Grandpa is doing a cartwheel, or your roommate is doing her 
laundry.
Before you try taking pictures with your Storm, read this chapter so you 
know what to expect and how to get the best shot. We also walk you through 
the easy steps in capturing that funny pose and show you how to store those 
shots and share them with your buddies.
Saying “Cheese”
Before you ask someone to pose, examine your BlackBerry Storm:
	
✓	Is the camera on? You see the convenience key on the right side of your 
BlackBerry Storm? It’s typically set by the carrier to bring up the Camera 
app by default. Press it. If the Camera application doesn’t come up, you 
can touch-press the Camera icon from the Home screen.
	
	You can change the applications launched by the right convenience 
key (or left convenience key, for that matter). From the Home screen, 
touch-press Options, and touch-press Screen/Keyboard. In the Right 
Side Convenience Key Opens field, touch-press the value; in the list that 
follows, touch-press the application you want.
	
✓	Is your finger blocking the lens? The lens is on the back of your device 
(see Figure 11-1).
	
✓	Do you see the image in the screen? Pressing the camera key again takes 
the picture. You should hear a funky shutter sound. Neat and easy, isn’t it?

184

One of the biggest complaints by owners of the original BlackBerry Storm was 
that the shutter wasn’t fast enough. If you have the Storm2, the shutter speed 
is improved slightly, but you still can’t take pictures in rapid succession. 
The common mistake most people make when taking a picture is not letting 
the camera focus first. Press the camera key (convenience key) half down or 
tap the screen to focus. Pressing the camera key fully or touch-pressing the 
screen snaps the photo. You’ll find that the camera works fastest and captures 
the best photos if you first focus (tap) and then take the picture (touch-press) 
instead of touch-pressing once.
Itching to take more pictures? Hold those snapping fingers of yours. If you 
take a few moments first to familiarize yourself with the camera’s features, 
the effort could go a long way.

185
 Chapter 11: Taking Great Pictures
Reading the screen indicators
When you open the Camera app, the top portion of the screen shows the 
image you’re about to capture. The bottom part contains icons, as labeled in 
Figure 11-2.

Choosing the picture quality
BlackBerry Storm can capture up to 3.2 megapixels (mp) of resolution. Saving 
at this resolution requires a lot of space. You can save at a lower quality and 
save some space on your BlackBerry.
	
Get a big microSD card. Nowadays, even a 32GB microSD card is inexpensive, 
and it holds thousands of pictures.
Here are the three resolutions you can choose:
	
✓	Normal: The default setting. Normal picture quality isn’t as smooth or 
fine as the other resolution choices but saves the most pictures.
	
	If you’re just taking pictures of your friends’ faces so you can attach 
them as Caller IDs, Normal is appropriate.
	
✓	Fine: A middle setting between Normal and SuperFine. This is a com­
promise if you’re concerned about space and want to capture more 
pictures. The best use for this setting is for any electronic viewer; this 
option isn’t good for printing.
	
✓	SuperFine: The best quality that your camera can capture. Choose this 
setting if you plan on printing the images.
Changing picture quality is a snap. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Press the camera key (the right convenience key on your Storm).
	
	 The Camera application opens.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Options.
	
	 The Camera Options screen appears, as shown in Figure 11-3.
	
3.	Touch-press Picture Quality.
	
4.	Touch-press the picture quality you want.
	
	 Picture Quality values are Normal, Fine, and SuperFine.
	
5.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
	
	 The picture quality you’ve chosen is now active.

Zooming and focusing
You need to be steady to get a good focus while taking shots. Although it’s 
convenient to use one hand while taking pictures, most of the time, you’ll get 
a blurry image if you try that.
	
When taking pictures, hold your BlackBerry with both hands, one holding the 
device steady and the other clicking the button.
Holding the camera with both hands is even more important if you’re zoom­
ing in. Yes, your camera is capable of providing up to 3x digital zoom. Here’s 
what you need to do for focusing and zooming:
	
✓	To focus: Press the camera key halfway.
	
✓	To zoom in: Finger-scroll up.
	
✓	To zoom out: Finger-scroll down.

188
Part III: Going Multimedia with Your Storm 
While you’re zooming, the value in the indicator changes from 1x, 2x, up to 
3x, and vice versa, depending on the direction you finger-scroll.
	
We don’t recommend using the zoom. Digital zoom (which is what your 
camera has) gives poor results because it’s accomplished through software 
and degrades the quality of the picture. The higher the zoom factor, the more 
pixilated the picture becomes. To get a clearer picture, get closer to the 
object.
Setting the flash
The lightning icon on the Camera screen (refer to Figure 11-2, earlier in this 
chapter) is the flash indicator. The default is Automatic, which shows a letter 
A beside the icon. Automatic means that where it’s dark, the flash fires; oth­
erwise, it doesn’t.
	
You can turn the flash on or off. When flash is off, the arrow image has a slash, 
just like you see on a Don’t Walk traffic signal. You can toggle the settings in 
the Camera Options screen. (Press the menu key and touch-press Options to 
get to the Camera Options screen.)
Setting the white balance
In photography, filters are used to compensate for the dominant light. For 
instance, a fluorescent versus an incandescent light could affect how warm 
the picture looks. Instead of using filters, most digital cameras have a fea­
ture to correct or compensate for many types of light settings. This feature 
is white balance. And yes, your Storm has it. You can choose Sunny, Cloudy, 
Night, Incandescent, Fluorescent, or Automatic. Automatic means your 
camera sets what it thinks are the best settings to apply.
You can change the white balance through the Camera Options screen.
	
The Camera Options screen is accessible by pressing the menu key and touch-
pressing Options on the menu that follows.
Setting the picture size
Aside from adjusting picture quality, you can adjust the actual size of the 
photo:

189
 Chapter 11: Taking Great Pictures
	
✓	Large: 2048 x 1536
	
✓	Medium: 1024 x 768
	
✓	Small: 640 x 480
Again, camera settings are accessible through the Camera Options screen by 
pressing the menu key and touch-pressing Options on the menu that appears.
Geotagging
Because your Storm has GPS capability, you can easily determine your loca­
tion based on longitude and latitude. This information can be added to your 
media files, including the pictures taken from your camera. Now you don’t 
have to wonder where you took that crazy pose. Adding geographic informa­
tion is known as geotagging.
Geotagging is disabled by default in your Storm. You can enable geotag­
ging from the Camera Options screen. (Press the menu key and touch-press 
Options to get to the Camera Options screen.)
	
If you have longitude and latitude information from one of your photos, you 
can use one of the free sites on the Web to locate that information on the map. 
One such site is www.travelgis.com/geocode/Default.aspx.
Working with Your Pictures
Suppose that you’ve taken a bunch of pictures, and you want to see them. And 
maybe delete the unflattering ones. Or perhaps organize them. No problem.
Viewing pictures
If you take a picture, you want to see it, right? Viewing a picture is a common 
function with your camera. You can see the image you just captured right 
then and there, as shown in Figure 11-4.
All the pictures you take on your camera are filed in a folder whose possible 
default location is based on whether you opted to save the pictures in
	
✓	Device memory: /Device Memory/home/user/pictures
	
✓	Media card: /Media Card/BlackBerry/pictures

190
Part III: Going Multimedia with Your Storm 
	
Figure 11-4:

Let your device file your pictures in the media card (microSD). You can easily 
move or share your pictures using the microSD card, and device memory is 
such a limited space that it’s better to reserve it for your other applications. 
The first time you use the Camera application, it asks you whether to save pic­
tures to the media card. If you aren’t sure what the current setting is, simply 
close the Camera application, take out the microSD card, and put it back in. 
The next time you open the Camera app, it displays the same prompt about 
letting you save pictures to the media card.
The format of picture filenames, based on the current date and time, is 
IMG<counter>-<yyyymmdd>-<hhmm>.jpg. So if you took the 21st picture 
at 9:30 a.m. on December 20, 2010, you end up with IMG00021-20101220-
0930.jpg.
	
If you’re browsing through your picture folders, you can view a picture by 
simply touch-pressing the picture file.
Creating a slide show
Want to see your pictures in a slide show? Just follow these steps:
	
1.	Press the camera key (the right convenience key on your Storm).
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press View Pictures.
	
	 The Pictures app opens.
	
3.	Press the menu key and touch-press Slide Show.
	
	 Voilà! Your BlackBerry Storm displays your pictures one at a time at a 
regular time interval.

191
 Chapter 11: Taking Great Pictures
The default interval between each picture is two seconds; you can change it 
in the Pictures Options screen. (After Step 2, press the menu key and touch-
press Options to get to the Pictures Options screen. Touch-press Slide Show 
Interval and finger-scroll to select the desired interval.)
Trashing pictures
If you don’t like the image you captured, you can delete it:
	
1.	Touch to highlight the picture you want to trash.
	
2.	Touch-press the Delete (X) icon.
	
	 A confirmation screen appears.
	
3.	Touch-press Delete.
Listing filenames versus thumbnails
When you open a folder packed with pictures, your BlackBerry automatically 
lists thumbnails, which are small previews of your pictures.
A preview is nice, but what if you’re looking for a picture and know the file­
name? Wouldn’t it be nice to see a list of filenames instead of thumbnails? 
Follow these steps:
	
1.	Touch-press the Media icon from the Home screen.
	
2.	Touch-press Pictures.
	
3.	Navigate to the location of your pictures.
	
4.	Go to a picture folder.
	
5.	Press the menu key and touch-press View List.
	
	 That’s exactly what you get: a list of all the pictures in the folder. The list 
shows a tiny image, the filename, and the date filed for each of the pictures.
Checking picture properties
Curious about the amount of memory your picture is using? Want to know 
the time you took the photo and more? Follow these steps:
	
1.	While in the Camera screen, view the list of your pictures by pressing 
the menu key and touch-pressing View Pictures.

192
Part III: Going Multimedia with Your Storm 
	
2.	Tap the picture in a list.
	
3.	Press the menu key and touch-press Properties.
	
	You see a screen similar to Figure 11-5.
	
Figure 11-5: 
Your picture 
properties.
	
The screen in Figure 11-5 displays the picture’s location in your BlackBerry, 
its size, and its last modification. The arrow with the text Removable indi­
cates that the picture is filed in the media card. The Hidden check box allows 
you to hide the file when navigating through your picture list. Once hidden, 
the file disappears from the list, and the only way to see the file in your Storm 
again is to use Explore. Check Chapter 12 for details about Explore.
Organizing your pictures
Organization is all about time and the best use of it. After all, you want to 
enjoy looking at your pictures — not looking for them. To accomplish that, 
you should organize your pictures by changing where they’re stored and 
named. With those capabilities, you should be on your way to organization 
nirvana.
Renaming a picture file
BlackBerry saves a file when you capture a picture. However, the filename is 
generic, something like IMGxxxx, where xxxx is a number.

193
 Chapter 11: Taking Great Pictures
	
Make it a habit to rename the file as soon as you’ve finished capturing the pic­
ture. It is easier to recognize Dean blows out birthday candles than 
IMG00003-20101013-0029.
Renaming is a snap. Here’s how:
	
1.	Display the picture onscreen or tap it in the list.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Rename.
	
	 A Rename screen appears.
	
3.	Type the name you want for this picture.
	
4.	Touch-press Save.
	
	 Your picture is renamed.
Creating a new folder
Being the organized person you are, you must be wondering about folders. 
Don’t fret; it’s simple to create one:
	
1.	In the Camera screen, press the menu key and touch-press View 
Pictures.
	
	 The screen displays the list of pictures in the current folder.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press the Up icon.
	
3.	Navigate to the main folder where you want your new folder to be 
created.
	
	 You should be within the folder where you want your new folder to be 
created. If not, repeat this step to navigate to that folder.
	
4.	Press the menu key and touch-press New Folder.
	
5.	Enter the name of the folder.
	
6.	Touch-press OK.
	
	 Your folder is created.
Moving pictures
There are many reasons for moving pictures between folders. The most obvi­
ous reason is to organize your pictures. Want to try it? Follow these steps:
	
1.	In the Camera screen, press the menu key and touch-press View 
Pictures.
	
	 The screen lists pictures in the current folder. If the picture you want to 
move isn’t in this folder, touch-press the Up icon to navigate up to other 
folders.

194
Part III: Going Multimedia with Your Storm 
	
2.	Tap the picture you want to move.
	
3.	Press the menu key and touch-press Move.
	
	 The screen that appears allows you to move the picture to the subfolder 
of the current folder location of the picture.
	
4.	If you want to move the picture to the subfolder within the current 
folder:
	
a.	Touch-press the folder name.
	
	Repeat this step until you reach the subfolder you want.
	
b.	Press the menu key and touch-press Move Here.
	
	Your picture is moved.
	
5.	If you want to move the picture outside the current folder hierarchy:
	
a.	Press the menu key and touch-press Up.
	
	A screen appears, displaying the topmost file folders. You can navi­
gate inside the folder hierarchy from here.
	
b.	Touch-press the folder name.
	
	Repeat this step until you reach the subfolder you want.
	
c.	Press the menu key and touch-press Move Here.
	
	Your picture is moved.
	
You can easily transfer your pictures to your PC or copy pictures from your 
PC to your Storm as well. See Chapter 12 for more details.
Sharing your pictures
Where’s the joy in taking great pictures if you’re the only one seeing them? 
Your BlackBerry has several options for sharing your bundle of joy:
	
1.	In the Camera screen, press the menu key and touch-press View 
Pictures.
	
2.	Tap a picture you want to share.
	
3.	Press the menu key and touch-press Send/Share.
	
4.	Touch-press one of the choices on the Send As screen:
 
• Email: This goes directly to the Compose EMail screen, with the 
currently selected picture as an attachment.

195
 Chapter 11: Taking Great Pictures
 
• MMS: Similar to Email, this opens a Compose MMS screen with the 
currently selected picture as an attachment. The only difference 
is that MMS first displays Contacts, letting you select the person’s 
phone number to receive the MMS before going to the compose 
screen. Another difference is that in MMS, the Storm sends a tiny 
version of the picture.
 
• Send to Messenger Contact: This option is available if BlackBerry 
Messenger is installed. This function is similar to MMS but displays 
only the contacts in BlackBerry Messenger. It uses BlackBerry 
Messenger to send a tiny version of the picture file.
	
You might also see other ways to send a picture file if you have other social 
networking clients installed. For example, if you have Facebook installed, you 
see the Send to Facebook option.
Setting a picture as Caller ID
Wouldn’t it be nice if, when your girlfriend was calling, you also could see 
her beautiful face? You can do that. If you have a photo of her saved in your 
BlackBerry, follow these steps to make sure you can:
	
1.	Touch-press the Media icon from the Home screen.
	
2.	Touch-press Pictures and navigate to the locations of your pictures.
	
3.	Touch-press to view the photo you want to appear when the person 
calls.
	
4.	Press the menu key, touch-press Set As, and then touch-press 
Caller ID.
	
	 The photo is displayed onscreen, with a superimposed portrait-size 
cropping rectangle. Inside the rectangle is a clear view of the photo; 
outside the rectangle, the photo is blurry. The clear view represents the 
portion of the photo that you want to show up as Caller ID.
	
5.	Finger-scroll the picture to position it inside the rectangle, making 
sure that the cropped image shows the face.
	
6.	Press the menu key and touch-press Crop and Save to crop the image.
	
	 Contacts appears.
	
7.	Touch-press the contact for whom you want this picture to appear.
	
	 A message appears, indicating that a picture is set for that contact.

196
Part III: Going Multimedia with Your Storm 
	
You can also add a photo to your contacts through the Contacts application 
(see Chapter 4).
Setting a Home screen image
Suppose that you have a stunning picture that you want to use as the back­
ground image for your BlackBerry. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Touch-press the Media icon from the Home screen.
	
2.	Touch-press Pictures.
	
3.	Navigate to the location of your pictures and touch-press the picture 
you want to use.
	
4.	Press the menu key, touch-press Set As, and then touch-press 
Wallpaper.

f a word describes today’s phone market trends, it’s convergence. Your 
BlackBerry Storm is among the participants in this race to bring things 
together. In addition to sending and receiving e-mail and being a phone, a 
camera, and a PDA, your BlackBerry Storm is a portable media player. In this 
small package, you can
	
✓	Listen to music
	
✓	Record and watch video clips
	
✓	Sample ring tones
	
✓	Snap and view pictures
These capabilities are all bundled into an application with a name you’d rec­
ognize even after sipping a couple of pints of strong ale: Media.

198
Part III: Going Multimedia with Your Storm 
Accessing Media
To run Media, simply touch-press the Media icon from the Home screen. The 
Media icon is easy to distinguish because it has the image of a CD and a musi­
cal note.
Media is a collection of media applications:
	
✓	Music
	
✓	Videos
	
✓	Pictures
	
✓	Ring Tones
	
✓	Voice Notes
	
✓	Video Camera
	
✓	Voice Notes Recorder
Each one is represented with an icon that you see upon opening Media, as 
shown in Figure 12-1. It’s not that difficult to figure out what each one of 
these media icons represents.
	
Figure 12-1: 
Explore 
Media here.
	

199
 Chapter 12: Satisfying Your Senses with Media Player
As you go through each of these apps, you will soon find out that Videos and 
Video Camera work together. The videos you capture in the Video Camera app 
are listed in Videos. You can even launch Video Camera inside the Videos app. 
This sort of relationship with Videos and Video Camera is replicated for Voice 
Notes and Voice Notes Recorder, where you can launch Voice Notes Recorder 
from Voice Notes and play recorded notes within Voice Notes.
Ready to have some fun?
Let the Music Play
You don’t need a quarter to play music on your BlackBerry Storm. Just touch-
press Music from the Media screen (refer to Figure 12-1). The Music screen 
appears, listing several potential views of your music collection, as shown in 
Figure 12-2:
	
✓	All Songs: In this view, all your music files are shown in alphabetical 
order.
	
✓	Artists: This view lists your music files by artist, so you can play your 
John Mayer songs in one go.
	
✓	Albums: View your music collection one album at a time.
	
✓	Genres: If you prefer not to mingle your country with your cutting-edge 
techno, navigate through this view.
	
✓	Playlists: Organize and play songs as you want — the perfect mixed 
tape!
	
✓	Sample Songs: When you’re dying to check out the player but haven’t 
yet put your collection into the BlackBerry Storm, go here. Your Storm 
comes with a few songs, and this is where you can find them.
	
✓	Shuffle Songs: Life is all about variety. When you’re tired of the song 
order in your playlist, touch-press this option.
After you touch-press a view, touch-press one of the songs to start playing it. 
After Storm starts playing a song, it plays the rest of the music listed in the 
view you selected. The standard interface is shown in Figure 12-3.

The two small pale icons just above the bottom row of icons indicate repeat 
and shuffle:
	
✓	If you want just this song to repeat again, touch-press the repeat icon. 
You can turn repeat off by touching the same icon.
	
✓	If you want the songs to be played again after the last song in the list 
is played, press the menu key, touch-press the repeat icon, and then 
touch-press Album.
	
✓	Bored with hearing the same sequence of songs? Touch-press the shuffle 
icon. Your songs will be played randomly.
	
You can’t fast-forward or rewind the traditional way, but you can position 
where Storm is playing by finger-scrolling the progress slider.
BlackBerry Storm supports the following music formats (with file 
extensions):
	
✓	ACC: Audio compression formats AAC, AAC+, and EAAC+ (.aac and 
.m4a)
	
✓	AMR: Adaptive Multi Rate-Narrow Band (AMR-NB) speech coder stan­
dard (.mmr and .3gp)
	
✓	MIDI: Polyphonic MIDI (.mid, .midi, and .smf)
	
✓	MP3: MPEG Part 1 and Part 2 audio layer 3 (.mp3 and .mp4)
	
✓	WMA: Windows Media Audio 9, Pro, and 10 (.wma and .asf)
	
The earpiece–mic combo that comes with your BlackBerry Storm is for only 
one ear, which is an issue when you’re on a train. To improve your experi­
ence, you can buy a stereo (two-ear) headset. A Bluetooth headset is a good 
option.
Creating a playlist
Sure, you have favorites in your song library. Having a playlist would be nice, 
right? On your Storm, you can create two types of playlists:
	
✓	Standard: A bare-bones playlist in which you manually add the music 
you want
	
✓	Automatic: A playlist in which you specify entries by artist, album, or 
genre, or any combination thereof

202

d.	When you’ve finished adding songs, press the menu key and 
touch-press Save.
	
	You’re finished!
	
6.	If you selected Automatic Playlist, do the following:
	
a.	Touch-press the + button to the right of the music criteria and 
select one of the listed combinations.
	
	Again, you can choose entries by Artist, Albums, or Genres, or a 
combination of any of the three options. If you choose by Artist, 
you’ll be presented with a list of artists; the same is true of choos­
ing by Albums and Genres, where a list of albums and genres, 
respectively, is shown for you to make a selection from.
	
b.	Repeat Step 6a if you want to add more values to your criteria.
	
c.	After you add the criteria you want to your automatic playlist, 
press the menu key and touch-press Save.
	
	You’re finished!
	
From time to time, you may play a song and want to add it to your playlist. 
No problem. While the song is playing, simply press the menu key and touch-
press Add to Playlist. In the screen that follows, select the playlist to which 
you want to add the song.

203
 Chapter 12: Satisfying Your Senses with Media Player
Playing from your playlist
Playing your playlist is a no-brainer:
	
1.	Touch-press Music from the Media screen or from the Home screen.
	
2.	From the Music screen, touch-press Playlists.
	
3.	Touch the playlist you want to start playing.
	
4.	Press the menu key and touch-press Play.
Now Showing
Playing a video is similar to playing music. Simply follow these steps:
	
1.	Touch-press Videos from the Media screen.
	
	 (You can launch Media by touch-pressing the Media icon from the Home 
screen.) The screen shows Videos and a list of video files at the bottom 
of the screen.
	
2.	Touch-press a file to play it onscreen.
You can record a video either from Videos or through the Video Camera 
application. To record a video from Video Camera, do the following:
	
1.	Touch-press Video Camera from the Media screen.
	
	 (You can launch Media from the Home screen.)
	
2.	Touch-press the white circle (record button) at the bottom of the 
screen to start recording.
	
	 Don’t wait for “Cut!” You can pause the camera by touch-pressing the 
pause button. You see the familiar video and audio controls, which are, 
from left to right: continue recording, stop, and play. The functions of 
the other buttons are also obvious: rename (for the filename), delete, 
and send via email.
	
3.	Touch-press the stop button when you’re ready to wrap up your home 
video.
	
	 You wind up at the previous screen with the video clip file listed. We 
know you’re itching to watch it.
To record a video from the Videos app, do the following:
	
1.	Touch-press Videos from the Media screen.

204
Part III: Going Multimedia with Your Storm 
	
2.	Touch-press the white circle (record button) at the bottom of the 
screen to start recording.
	
3.	Touch-press the escape key to wrap up your home video.
Picture This
If you upgraded from an older BlackBerry, you may know Pictures, which lets 
you view, zoom into, and rotate pictures:
	
1.	Touch-press Pictures from the Media screen.
	
2.	Touch-press one of the listed views to navigate to your pictures.
	
	 You can choose among the following views:
 
• All Pictures: Displays pictures filed in device memory and on the 
microSD card.
 
• Picture Folders: Displays only pictures filed in the current location 
of images captured by the Camera app. The default is the picture 
folder on the microSD card.
 
• Sample Folders: Displays sample pictures that come with your 
smart phone.
	
3.	Finger-scroll to find the picture.
	
4.	Touch-press the file.
	
	 Easy does it, right?
	
Check out Sample Pictures. Your BlackBerry comes with nice pictures you can 
use as the Home screen background. You can assign a cartoon to a contact 
as a Caller ID until you get a chance to take the person’s picture and use that 
instead. (We describe how to do that in Chapter 11.)
	
Your Storm supports the following standard picture formats:
	
✓	BMP: Bitmap file format (.bmp)
	
✓	JPEG: Developed by the Joint Photographic Experts Group committee 
(.jpg); typically compresses the image file to a tenth of its size with 
little perceptible loss of image quality
	
✓	PNG: Portable Network Graphics (.png), which is a bitmapped image 
format that employs a lossless data transmission
	
✓	TIFF: Tagged Image File Format (.tif), which is mostly used in scan­
ners and is under the control of Adobe Systems
	
✓	WBMP: Wireless Bitmap (.wbmp) file format, which is optimized for 
mobile devices

205
 Chapter 12: Satisfying Your Senses with Media Player
Viewing in Pictures
When you’re in Pictures and navigating a folder, the default view always 
shows thumbnails. This allows you to quickly view many pictures at the same 
time before deciding which one to open.
Want to view them all? Run a slide show. When you’ve navigated to the fold­
ers where your pictures are listed, press the menu key and touch-press View 
Slide Show.
A convenient way to view pictures is to finger-scroll sideways. Scrolling right 
transitions the view to the next picture; you’ll see a smooth sideways move­
ment of the picture in the screen. Scrolling left transitions in the opposite 
direction until the preceding picture is displayed.
Zoom to see details
To zoom in a photo, do the following. Open the photo, press the menu key, and 
touch-press Zoom In. You can repeat this step to increase the degree of the 
zoom. After you are zoomed, you can finger-scroll to slide the picture around 
the screen. To zoom out, press the menu key and touch-press Zoom Out.
	
An image is normally defaulted to fit the screen, but you can toggle it by press­
ing the menu key and touch-pressing Fit to Screen or View Actual Size.
Lord of the Ring Tones
Ah, the proliferation of ring tones; that’s history. Nothing beats hearing a 
loud, funky ring tone while you’re sleeping on a bus or a train. You can wake 
other passengers, too, whether you want to use the top 40, old-fashioned 
digital beats, or something you recorded yourself.
To hear the ring tones that come with your BlackBerry Storm, do the following:
	
1.	Touch-press Ring Tones from the Media screen.
	
	 You see two views, All Ring Tones and My Ring Tones.
	
2.	Touch-press All Ring Tones.
	
	 All ring tones, including the preloaded ones, are displayed.
	
3.	Touch-press any one of them and enjoy.
	
	 While playing a ring tone, touch-press the right arrow to go to the next 
tone; touch-press the left arrow to go the previous one.

206
Part III: Going Multimedia with Your Storm 
	
4.	Stumble on a ring tone you like.
	
5.	Press the menu key and touch-press Set as Ring Tone.
	
	 You see a screen allowing you to choose the profile to which this ring 
tone applies (check out Chapter 3 for a quick refresher on profiles). You 
can choose All Profiles, Normal Profile Only, or Cancel.
	
6.	Touch-press either All Profiles or Normal Profile Only.
	
	 That ring tone plays when your phone rings on the profile you selected.
	
A ring tone is similar to a music file and includes the same music formats:
	
✓	ACC: Advanced Auto Coding format, used by iTunes
	
✓	AMR: Adaptive Multi-Rate, a popular audio format for mobile transmis­
sion and mobile applications
	
✓	M4A: A subset of ACC for audio only
	
✓	MIDI: Musical Instrument Digital Interface, a popular audio format for 
musical instruments
	
✓	MP3: MPEG Audio Layer 3, the most popular music format
	
✓	WMA: Windows Media Audio, a Microsoft audio file format
If you’re familiar with audio-editing software, you can make your own ring 
tone. Save the tone as one of the formats just listed and copy it to your Storm 
(see the “Working with Media Files” section, later in this chapter, to see how 
to copy files from your PC to your Storm). The Internet has a plethora of ring 
tones, and many are free. The only possible harm you get from downloading 
one is being annoyed with how it sounds. The default Home page on Browser 
(mobile.blackberry.com) has links to sources of ring tones; touch-press 
the Fun and Pages link on the Home page.
Recording Your Voice
A feature-packed smart phone like your Storm should come with a voice 
recorder, and it does. Within Media is Voice Notes Recorder, a neat recording 
application. Now you can record your billion-dollar ideas without having to 
type every detail:
	
1.	Touch-press Voice Notes Recorder.
	
	 The Voice Notes Recorder application launches, sporting the simple and 
clean screen shown in Figure 12-4.

207

Figure 12-4: 
Record your 
voice here.
	
	
2.	When you’re ready, touch-press the record button (the white circle).
	
	 The app starts recording and the record button changes to the pause 
button.
	
	 Your BlackBerry’s microphone is designed to be close to your mouth, 
like any mobile phone should be.
	
3.	Press the pause button.
	
	 Familiar audio and video controls appear, from left to right: continue 
recording, stop, and play. Other buttons are rename (for renaming the 
file), delete, and send via email.
	
4.	Press the stop button to wrap it up.
	
	 You return to the Record Voice Notes screen, which now ready to 
record again.
Playing Your Voice Notes
After you recorded your billion-dollar idea, recalling or playing it back is a 
snap:
	
1.	From Media, touch-press Voice Notes.
	
	 The Voice Notes app launches, with your voice notes listed.

208
Part III: Going Multimedia with Your Storm 
	
	 You can launch Voice Notes Recorder from Voice Notes. To record, 
simply touch-press Voice Notes Recorder on the Voice Notes screen. 
Voice Notes Recorder is listed near the top of the screen. Then you can 
follow the procedure in the “Recording Your Voice” section, earlier in 
this chapter, starting with Step 2.
	
2.	Touch-press your voice recording when you need to hear your bril­
liant idea.
Turning It Up (or Down)
Whether you’re listening to music, watching a video, or listening to your 
voice recording, adjusting the volume is easy.
	
Your Storm comes with dedicated volume buttons on the top-right side of 
the device. The top button (with the plus sign) turns the volume up, and the 
bottom button (with the minus sign) turns the volume down. The onscreen 
volume slider reflects anything you did to the volume buttons.
Navigating the Menu
All Media applications except Pictures have a common menu. The menu 
items are mostly self-explanatory, but this section quickly highlights what 
you’ll see. Because Pictures is the odd man out, we’ll start with it.
Navigating the menu in Pictures
In the Pictures menu, press the menu key while you’re viewing an image. On 
the menu that appears, you see the following items:
	
✓	Next: Jumps to the next item in the list. This option appears only if an 
item is after this image file in the current folder.
	
✓	Previous: Jumps to the previous item. This option appears only if a pre­
vious item is in the current folder.
	
✓	Delete: Deletes the image file.
	
✓	Move: Moves the file to a different folder.
	
✓	Rename: Renames the image file.
	
✓	Properties: Displays the image file’s location, size, and time of last 
modification.

Navigating the menu in Music, Videos, 
Ring Tones, and Voice Notes
Whether you are watching a video or playing music, a ring tone, or a voice 
note, you see the following items after pressing the menu key:
	
✓	Replay: Plays the media file again from the start.
	
✓	Repeat: Plays the same media file after it reaches the end.
	
✓	Show Playlist: Displays the list of media files in the current folder or 
playlist.
	
✓	Activate Handset: Mutes the device’s speaker. Use this if you want to 
use the earpiece. This menu item appears only if you have activated the 
speakerphone.
	
✓	Activate Speakerphone: Uses the device’s speaker and mutes the ear­
piece. This menu item appears only if the handset is activated.
Using Explore
You can navigate to a media file in many ways, but Explore is the quickest 
way to find a file. It has similarities to Windows Explorer and a search facility 
similar to Find in BlackBerry applications such as Contacts, MemoPad, and 
Tasks.
To launch Explore, touch-press Media from the Home screen, press the menu 
key, and touch-press Explore. The Explore screen displays the device’s top­
most folders, which are Media Card and Device Memory.
Folders are in a tree hierarchy. You get into the child folders, or subfolders, 
by touch-pressing from the parent folder, or top folder.
	
If you’ve turned on a picture’s Hidden property, using Explore is the only 
method in your Storm through which you’ll be able to locate the file again:
	
1.	Navigate to the folder where your picture file is located.
	
	 If you don’t know exactly where the picture file is located, you may have 
to touch-press different folders until you find the file.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Show Hidden.
	
The default location for pictures taken by the Camera application is /Device 
Memory/home/user/pictures or /Media Card/BlackBerry/pictures.

Memory Use
Don’t leave home for vacation without extra space for photos. Wonder how 
much space is left on your media card? Do the following:
	
1.	Touch-press Media from the Home screen.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Memory Use.
	
	 A Memory Use screen similar to the left side of Figure 12-5 appears; 
giving you a rundown of how much space is used and remaining on the 
media card and in device memory. Touch-press the Details button if you 
want a breakdown, as shown on the right side of Figure 12-5.
	
Figure 12-5: 
Memory 
use on the 
media card.
	
Changing the Media Flavor
As with the rest of your Storm applications, you can customize some parts of 
the media applications. You do so through the Options screen in Media:
	
1.	Press the menu key while in the Media app.
	
	 You can press the menu key while you’re in any application inside Media 
too.
	
2.	Touch-press Options.
	
	 The Media Options screen appears, as shown in Figure 12-6. Each option 
is described in the following sections.

tom (right).
	
Customizing Media
Starting at the top of the Media Options screen and below the General sec­
tion, you can finesse the following options:
	
✓	Close Media Player When Inactive: The default is Off, but you can set 
this option to 5, 10, 20, 30, or 45 minutes. This option can save battery 
life if you get distracted and leave your Storm on a table playing your 
favorite video.
	
✓	Set Convenience Keys: Change the settings for the right and left con­
venience keys, which are shortcut keys to an application. The right 
convenience key defaults to launching the Camera app, and the left con­
venience key defaults to launching Voice Dialing.
Going down the Media Options screen, under the Playback section, you can 
customize the following options:
	
✓	Headset Equalizer: The default is Off, but if you want a different audio 
setting, you have several options: Bass Boost, Bass Lower, Dance, Hip 
Hop, Jazz, Lounge, Loud, R&B, Rock, Treble Boost, Treble Lower, and 
Vocal Boost.
	
✓	Audio Boost: You can set this option On or Off.
	
✓	Turn Off Auto Backlighting: Your Storm includes a backlight feature, 
which provides additional screen lighting. The backlight turns on when 
you move the Storm from shade to direct sunlight. When backlighting 
keeps bothering you when you’re watching a movie, this is the place to 
toggle it off.

212
Part III: Going Multimedia with Your Storm 
	
	Turn off backlighting when you badly need battery juice.
	
✓	Display Closed Captions: This option applies only to videos that sup­
port closed captions. The options are Yes (the default) and No.
	
✓	Appearance: This option changes the appearance of Media. Choose 
Style 1 or Style 2 (the default).
	
✓	Position: This option refers to the location of the playback controls. 
You can choose Top Left, Top, Top Right, Bottom Right, Bottom (the 
default), or Bottom Left.
	
✓	Font Scale: Choose the size of the font you can use in Media during 
playback: Largest, Larger, Large, Normal (the default), Small, Smaller, or 
Smallest.
The box with a line that displays For your viewing pleasure works with 
Display Closed Captions. If you opt to display closed caption, this box shows 
up as a way to illustrates where the closed caption is going to appear during 
playback.
Customizing Pictures
Toward the bottom of the Media Options screen and below the Pictures sec­
tion, you can change the Pictures app in the following ways:
	
✓	Sort By: This option toggles file sorting based on recent updates or the 
filenames of your pictures.
	
✓	Slide Show Interval: When viewing your files in a slide show, a picture 
appears for this many seconds before moving to the next picture.
	
✓	Exclude Folders: Navigate to a picture folder and exclude the display of 
pictures inside it. The fewer pictures you have or the fewer pictures that 
are displayed, the faster Pictures loads the list. So this option isn’t really 
intended for your secret folders, but hey, you can use it for hiding some­
thing too.
Working with Media Files
To acquire media files for your BlackBerry Storm, you have as many choices 
as there are ice cream flavors. This section describes the most common ways 
to get media files: using the Storm as a flash drive, using Media Manager, syn­
chronizing with iTunes, and downloading sounds.

213
 Chapter 12: Satisfying Your Senses with Media Player
	
Because the Storm does not have a physical keyboard, you lose the speed 
inherent in keyboard shortcuts. App developer NikkiSoft introduced 
QuickLaunch for the original BlackBerry Storm, and it remains a must-have 
app. QuickLaunch enables you to set shortcuts for common tasks, such as 
calling your significant other, e-mailing your boss, or visiting a specific Web 
site. Setting a convenience key to open QuickLaunch allows you to access 
these shortcut commands immediately, saving time and touch-screen presses.
Using your Storm as a flash drive
If you are a Windows user, the most common way to manipulate media files 
into and out of your Storm is to attach it to a PC and use Windows Explorer:
	
1.	Connect your BlackBerry to your PC, using the USB cable that came 
with your Storm.
	
	 Only folders and files stored on the microSD card will be visible to your 
PC. Make sure that the microSD card is in your BlackBerry Storm before 
you connect your Storm to the PC.
	
	 When connected, the Storm screen displays a prompt for enabling mass 
storage mode.
	
2.	On the Storm screen, touch-press Yes.
	
	 A screen appears on your Storm, asking for your password.
	
3.	On the Storm screen, type your BlackBerry password.
	
	 The device is now ready to behave like an ordinary flash drive. On your 
PC, the Removable Disk dialog box opens.
	
4.	On your PC, in the Removable Disk dialog box, click Open Folder to 
View Files and then click OK.
	
	 The familiar Windows Explorer screen appears.
	
5.	Manipulate your media files as you want.
	
	 You can do anything you typically do with a normal Windows folder, 
such as drag and drop, copy, and delete files.
	
6.	Close Windows Explorer when you’re finished.
If you are a Mac user, you can easily manipulate media files by connecting 
your Storm to your Mac:
	
1.	Connect your BlackBerry to your Mac, using the USB cable that came 
with your Storm.

214
Part III: Going Multimedia with Your Storm 
	
	 Only folders and files stored on the microSD card are visible to your 
Mac. Make sure the microSD card is in your BlackBerry Storm before 
you connect the Storm to the Mac.
	
	 When connected, the Storm screen displays a prompt for enabling mass 
storage mode.
	
2.	On the Storm screen, touch-press Yes.
	
	 A screen appears on the Storm, asking for your password.
	
3.	On the Storm screen, type your BlackBerry password.
	
	 The device is now ready to behave like an ordinary flash drive, and a 
disk drive icon titled BLACKBERRY appears on the Mac desktop.
	
4.	On your Mac, click the BLACKBERRY disk drive icon.
	
	 The familiar Finder screen appears.
	
5.	Manipulate your media files as you want.
	
	 You can do anything you typically do with a normal Mac folder, such as 
drag and drop, copy, and delete files.
	
6.	Close Finder when you’re finished.
Meet and greet Media Manager
Roxio is known for its CD-ripping software. (Ripping converts music files in 
CD format to other popular compressed formats.) RIM licensed a portion 
of Roxio and packaged it with the Windows version of BlackBerry Desktop 
Software. Even though this version doesn’t offer the entire Roxio software 
suite, you can still take advantage of fantastic features, such as
	
✓	Ripping CDs
	
✓	Converting files to get the best playback on your Storm
	
✓	Managing music files
	
✓	Syncing media files to your device
	
If you have an old version of Media Manager, just point your desktop Internet 
browser to http://na.blackberry.com/eng/services/desktop for direc­
tions on downloading the latest version for free and installing it on your PC.
In the following sections, we show you the Media Manager interface and how 
to copy a video file onto your Storm.

215
 Chapter 12: Satisfying Your Senses with Media Player
Accessing Media Manager
You can access Media Manager through BlackBerry Desktop Manager, which 
Chapter 15 describes in detail. Get to Desktop Manager this way:
	
1.	On your PC, click the Windows Start button.
	
2.	Choose All Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop Manager.
	
	 BlackBerry Desktop Manager appears, as shown in Figure 12-7.
	
Figure 12-7: 
Access 
Media 
Manager 
here.
	
	
3.	Click the Media icon.
	
	 A screen appears, showing Media Manager and BlackBerry Media Sync 
sections. Each section has a Start button.
	
4.	In the Media Manager section, click the Start button.
	
	 The initial Media Manager screen is well organized and gives you the 
following options: Manage Pictures, Manage Music, Manage Videos, and 
View Connected Devices.
	
5.	Click one of the options.
The Media Manager screen (shown in Figure 12-8) is easy to use and has the 
same interface as Windows Explorer:
	
✓	The left side is where you navigate to your folders and files.
	
✓	The right side displays the files in the folder you selected on the left 
side.

216
Part III: Going Multimedia with Your Storm 
	
Figure 12-8: 
View your 
media 
files in this 
screen.
	
The top-left section — My Media — represents your desktop; the bottom-left 
section — My Devices — represents your Storm. You can move or copy files 
easily. When you’re copying, for example, one section can be the source, and 
the other section can be the destination. By simply dragging the files between 
the two sections, you can copy on the same screen. Neat.
Importing media files to Media Manager
Here’s a quick and easy way to import media files:
	
1.	In Windows Explorer, navigate to find the media files you want.
Other features of Media Manager
Spend some time exploring Media Manager. 
It has interesting features you may find useful. 
Here’s a quick rundown of what you can do 
with Media Manager:
	✓	Import media files
	✓	E-mail media files
	✓	Enhance photos and apply special effects 
to photos by using PhotoSuite
	✓	Set song info (such as the title, the artist, 
the album, the genre, the year, or an image) 
to show as track art when playing a song
	✓	Record audio
	✓	Customize photo printing

217
 Chapter 12: Satisfying Your Senses with Media Player
	
2.	Drag and drop the files into Media Manager.
	
	 You can drag and drop files to the folder in the left part of the screen 
(where the folder tree appears) or to the right part (where the files are 
listed). Just make sure that when you’re doing the latter, the current 
folder in the tree view is the folder where you want the media files to be 
imported.
You can also use Media Manager to locate the files you want without going 
through Windows Explorer. The trick is to change the view to Folders. Check 
out the two tabs in the top-left corner. The first tab, My Media, is the default 
view. The Folders tab, just to the right of My Media, bears an icon of (go 
figure) a folder.
Click the Folders tab. You see a tree view, but this time it looks exactly like you 
see it in Windows Explorer, as shown in Figure 12-9. The files can be on your 
local hard drive or in a network folder accessible by your desktop computer.
	
Figure 12-9: 
Navigate to 
your desk-
top media 
files here.
	
	
Not all media file types are directly compatible with your Storm. This is espe­
cially true for video files. But Media Manager can convert most media files to a 
usable Storm format.
Adding a media file to your Storm
Time to copy files to your Storm. Here’s the rundown:
	
1.	Connect your Storm to your PC, using the USB cable that came with 
your BlackBerry.

218
Part III: Going Multimedia with Your Storm 
	
2.	On the Media Manager screen, drag and drop your media files from 
the My Media view to any folder in My Devices.
	
	 You can drag and drop an entire album. After dropping a media file, 
you’re prompted to convert the file to a format that’s usable by your 
Storm, as shown in Figure 12-10.
	
Figure 12-10: 
Choose to 
convert your 
media files 
for optimum 
playback.
	
	
3.	Select a conversion option:
 
• Convert for Optimal Playback: This is the safest bet and is the 
default. This option is applicable to video files where the converter 
makes sure that the video fits perfectly with the Storm’s screen 
resolution.
 
• Copy with No Conversion: Copies the file faster. The file is copied 
to your Storm as is, but the file might not play on your Storm.
 
• Advanced Conversion Options: From here, another screen lets 
you downgrade the quality to minimize the file size. The option 
also allows you to crop the video so that the entire screen is filled 
instead of showing dark margins.
	
4.	Click OK to begin the transfer.
Synchronizing with iTunes using 
BlackBerry Media Sync
If you have an iPod, you’re probably using iTunes and maintaining a playl­
ist and perhaps a subscription to podcasts or videocasts. Podcast files are 
downloaded to iTunes via RSS. RSS — Really Simple Syndication — is a kind 
of digital file publish-subscribe mechanism. RSS is the mechanism iTunes 
uses to receive audio and video recordings, which most people refer to as 
podcasts and videocasts, respectively.
To sync your Storm with iTunes, follow these quick and easy steps:
	
1.	Connect your Storm to your desktop PC, using the USB cable that 
came with your BlackBerry.

219
 Chapter 12: Satisfying Your Senses with Media Player
	
2.	Click the Windows Start button.
	
3.	Choose All Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop Manager.
	
4.	When BlackBerry Desktop Manager appears (refer to Figure 12-7, ear­
lier in this chapter), click the Media icon.
	
	 A screen appears, showing Media Manager and BlackBerry Media Sync 
sections. Each section has a Start button.
	
5.	In the BlackBerry Media Sync section, click the Start button.
	
	 A new screen appears, such as the one shown in Figure 12-11.
	
Figure 12-11: 
The 
BlackBerry 
Media Sync 
screen.
	
	
6.	Click the Show iTunes Playlist icon (in the bottom-left corner).
	
	 A list of what you have in iTunes appears, as shown in Figure 12-12. 
This is the part of the screen where you choose iTunes media file types.
Downloading sounds
RIM offer a Web site from which you can sample and download new ring 
tones, alarms, notifiers, and tunes. On your Storm, simply go to http://
mobile.blackberry.com. Finger-scroll down to the Personalize section 
and touch-press the Ringtones link. A list of available ring tones is displayed. 
And did we mention that they’re free?
Touch-pressing the ring tone link gives you an option to play the tone or 
download it to your Storm. Downloaded ring tones are filed in the My Ring 
Tones section of the Ring Tones screen when you open the Ring Tones app 
inside the Media application.
	
RIM isn’t the only site where you can find ring tones. The Web is a treasure 
trove, and ring tones and other media files are safe to download, so go hunting.

Chapter 13
Getting Around with 
BlackBerry GPS
In This Chapter
▶	Using GPS safely
▶	Preparing to use GPS on your BlackBerry
▶	Choosing a GPS application
A
few years back, when some Northern American network carriers 
introduced global positioning system (GPS) on their versions of the 
BlackBerry, we were quite impressed . . . until we tried it. The response time 
was slow, and it wasn’t accurate. On top of that, the network carriers charged 
an arm and a leg for this inferior service. As it turns out, those GPS functions 
weren’t actually embedded in the BlackBerry. How low-tech!
Today, many BlackBerry models, including your BlackBerry Storm2, come 
with built-in GPS.
	
Depending on your network carrier, your BlackBerry Storm2 GPS might be 
disabled. For example, Verizon Wireless has a history of disabling GPS capa­
bilities and steers users toward Verizon’s own GPS application, VZ Navigator. 
However, an application such as Google Maps uses both GPS and the network 
to find your location. So if GPS is disabled, Google Maps can still approximate 
where you are on the map.
Putting Safety First
	
Some GPS features are useful not only while you’re walking on the street, but 
also while you’re driving a car. Although you’ll be tempted to use BlackBerry 
GPS while driving, we strongly suggest that you not adjust it while you’re driving.

222
Part III: Going Multimedia with Your Storm 
Before you start using BlackBerry GPS in your car, you need to get a car 
holder (preferably a car kit with a car charger) and to resolve the BlackBerry 
backlight idle timeout issue. Your BlackBerry Storm’s screen automatically 
dims when idle to conserve battery power, but this presents a problem when 
you are driving.
	
You can buy a car kit online by searching for BlackBerry car kit. Or go to one of 
the following links:
	
✓	www.shopblackberry.com
	
✓	www.shop.crackberry.com
Now that you have all you need to keep you safe, keep on reading.
Getting What You Need
GPS requires navigation maps, which are usually downloaded in little pieces 
as needed.
	
While you are using the map, the more you move about and use your GPS, the 
more map pieces you’ll download, which means you might have to pay when 
your data quota is used up. If you didn’t subscribe to an unlimited data plan 
from your network carrier, be aware that going over your monthly data quota 
might result in extra charges from your carrier.
In general, for BlackBerry GPS to work, you need
	
✓	A BlackBerry with a built-in GPS or a BlackBerry with an external GPS 
and a Bluetooth connection (which the BlackBerry Storm has)
	
✓	A data plan from your network carrier (an unlimited data plan is 
recommended)
	
✓	To be in an area with a radio signal (so you can download the maps)
Choosing GPS Application Options
We’ve identified three GPS applications that you can use on your BlackBerry:
	
✓	BlackBerry Maps
	
✓	Google Maps
	
✓	TeleNav GPS Navigator
Both BlackBerry Maps and Google Maps are free.

223
 Chapter 13: Getting Around with BlackBerry GPS
BlackBerry Maps
Out of the box, your BlackBerry comes with the BlackBerry Maps application. 
See Figure 13-1.
	
Figure 13-1: 
BlackBerry 
Maps on the 
BlackBerry 
Storm.
	
You can use BlackBerry Maps to do the following:
	
✓	Find a location by typing an address or by using Contacts
	
✓	Get point-to-point directions (from an airport to a hotel, for instance)
	
✓	E-mail or SMS a location to colleagues and friends
	
✓	Turn GPS on or off
	
✓	Zoom into and out of the map
You can turn GPS on or off. You can still perform these functions with it 
turned off, but you won’t see your location.
You can tweak the light setting in BlackBerry Maps as follows:
	
1.	Press the menu key and touch-press Maps.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Options.
	
3.	In the Backlight Timeout When field, touch-press < 50% Battery.
	
	 You can set this to whatever you like, but we recommend <50% or <25%.
	
4.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save.

224
Part III: Going Multimedia with Your Storm 
Google Maps
Google Maps is the mobile version of maps.google.com. It has most of the 
online features, including satellite imaging and traffic information. Best of all, 
it’s free. Like BlackBerry Maps, Google Maps can be used even without GPS.
You can search for businesses and landmarks. It’s like having the ultimate 
411 (with a map) at the tip of your fingers.
Because Google Maps doesn’t come with your BlackBerry, you need to down­
load it. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Open your BlackBerry Storm Browser.
	
2.	Go to www.google.com/gmm.
	
	 The Web page loads, and its icon appears on your Home screen.
	
3.	After Google Maps is loaded, press the menu key.
	
	 From here, you can do the following:
 
• Find businesses and landmarks, including phone numbers, street 
addresses, and Web addresses
 
• Find and map exact addresses
 
• Get step-by-step directions from point A to point B
 
• View satellite images of the current map
 
• Get traffic information for major highways
With GPS on, your current location is a blue blinking dot; see Figure 13-2.

225
 Chapter 13: Getting Around with BlackBerry GPS
	
You need to have a radio signal to download maps to your BlackBerry Storm. 
In addition, we recommend having an unlimited data plan if you use GPS a lot.
TeleNav GPS Navigator
TeleNav GPS Navigator is a full-featured GPS solution; it’s a GPS device 
replacement, which means that the folks at TeleNav want you to use your 
BlackBerry in the car. Unlike the other products listed earlier, TeleNav has 
turn-by-turn voice instructions to get you to your destination.
If you are going on a road trip, we highly recommend that you first purchase 
a car kit mount so your Storm2 is easily visible while you are driving; see 
Chapter 19 for information on car mount kits.
TeleNav’s feature list is extensive and includes these features:
	
✓	3D maps
	
✓	Real-time compass
	
✓	Wi-Fi hotspot finder
The feature we like the most is the human-voice step-by-step driving direc­
tions. Depending on your network carrier, TeleNav costs about $10 a month 
and offers a 60-day free trial. Visit www.telenav.com for more information. 
After the product is downloaded, an icon appears on your screen.

Calling Your Favorite Person
In This Chapter
▶	Using the Phone application
▶	Making and receiving calls
▶	Customizing your BlackBerry phone
▶	Conferencing with more than one person
▶	Talking hands free on your BlackBerry phone
▶	Multitasking with your BlackBerry phone
T
he BlackBerry phone operates no differently from any other phone 
you’ve used. Why bother with this chapter? Your BlackBerry phone can 
do things your run-of-the-mill cellphone can’t. For example, when was the last 
time your phone was connected to your to-do list? Have you ever received an 
e-mail and placed a call directly from that e-mail? We didn’t think so. But with 
your BlackBerry, you can do all these things and more.
Using the BlackBerry Phone Application
The folks at RIM have created an intuitive user interface to all the essential 
Phone features, including making and receiving calls.
Making a call
To make a call, follow these steps:
	
1.	Press the green send key.
	
2.	Touch-press the phone number of the person you want to call.
	
3.	Press the green send key again to call.

228
Part III: Going Multimedia with Your Storm 
Calling from Contacts
Because you can’t possibly remember all your friends’ and colleagues’ 
phone numbers, calling from Contacts is convenient and useful. To call from 
Contacts, follow these steps:
	
1.	Press the green send key.
	
	 The Phone application opens.
	
2.	Press the Contacts tab (top-right tab).
	
	 Contacts opens. From here, you can search as usual for the contact 
you’d like to call.
	
3.	From Contacts, touch-press your call recipient.
	
4.	Press the green send key.
	
	 This makes the call.
Using a calling card or dialing an extension
Have you ever dialed a long-distance number using a calling card? First you 
call the calling-card access number, then you enter the code, and then you 
dial the long-distance number. Major pain in the behind. Although not as bad, 
dialing someone’s extension isn’t fun either.
	
In Contacts, under the Contact Phone Number field, you type x and the exten­
sion number. The next time you call that contact, a screen asks if you want the 
extension dialed for you (see Figure 14-1). You can do the same with a calling-
card access number, but add the access number and x in front of the phone 
number.
	
Figure 14-1: 
Using a call-
ing card to 
call interna-
tionally with 
ease.
	

229
 Chapter 14: Calling Your Favorite Person
For example, if you’re in the United States and using a calling card for a United 
Kingdom number, the phone number field in Contacts would look like this: 
800-555-1314x011-44-775-555-1212. The phone number is 011-44-775-555-1212; 
the calling-card access number is 800-555-1314.
Getting a call
Receiving a call on your BlackBerry is even easier than making a call. You can 
receive calls in a couple of ways:
	
✓	Use your automated answering feature. Automated answering is trig­
gered when you take your BlackBerry out of your holster; in other 
words, just taking out the BlackBerry forces it to automatically pick up 
any call, so you can start talking right away. The disadvantage of this is 
that you don’t have time to see who is calling you (on your Caller ID).
	
✓	Answer manually. When you get a call, your screen will look something 
like Figure 14-2. Just touch-press Answer to pick up the phone.
	
Figure 14-2: 
There’s an 
incoming 
call for you!
	
	
To disable autoanswering, make sure the Auto Answer Call option is set to 
Never. You can get to the Auto Answer Call option by pressing the menu key 
from the Phone application, touch-pressing Options from the Phone menu, 
and then touch-pressing General Options.
What’s the advantage of disabling autoanswering? Manual answering allows 
you to answer or ignore a call, as shown in Figure 14-3. This way, you can see 
on your Caller ID who’s calling and then pick up or ignore.

Muting lets you hear but not be heard. This option is useful when you’re on 
a conference call (see the upcoming section “Arranging Conference Calls”). 
Maybe you’re on the bus or have kids in the background.
To mute or unmute your call, toggle the Mute icon.
Turning down the volume
You can adjust the call volume, a simple yet important action on your 
BlackBerry phone, by pressing the volume up or volume down key on the 
right side of your BlackBerry Storm during a call.
Customizing Your Phone
For your BlackBerry phone to work the way you like, you first have to set it 
up the way you want. This section offers some settings that can make you the 
master of your BlackBerry phone.

Setting up your voice mail number
This section shows you how to set up your voice mail access number. 
Unfortunately, the instructions for setting up your voice mailbox vary, 
depending on your service provider. But usually, you can access the voice 
mail by pressing the menu key in the Phone application and touch-pressing 
the Call Voice Mail option.
	
Most service providers are more than happy to walk you through the steps to 
get your mailbox set up in a jiffy.
To set up your voice mail access number:
	
1.	Press the green send key.
	
	 The Phone application opens.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press the options item.
	
	 A list of phone options appears.
	
3.	Touch-press Voice Mail.
	
	 This opens the Voice Mail Configuration screen.
	
4.	In the Access the Number field, type your voice mail access number.
	
	 If this field is empty and you don’t know this number, contact your ser­
vice provider and ask for your voice mail access number. Typically, it’s 
your mobile number.
	
5.	Touch-press the menu key and then touch-press Save.
Using call forwarding
The BlackBerry has two types of call forwarding:
	
✓	Forward All Calls: Any calls to your BlackBerry are forwarded to the 
number you designate. Another name for this feature is unconditional 
forwarding.
	
✓	Forward Unanswered Calls: Calls that meet different types of conditions 
are forwarded to different numbers as follows:
 
• If Busy: You don’t have call waiting turned on, and you’re on the 
phone.
 
• If No Answer: You don’t hear your phone ring or can’t pick up your 
phone. (Perhaps you’re in a meeting.)
 
• If Unreachable: You’re out of network coverage and can’t get a 
signal.

232
Part III: Going Multimedia with Your Storm 
Out of the box, your BlackBerry forwards any unanswered calls, regardless of 
conditions, to your voice mail number by default. However, you can add new 
numbers to forward a call to.
You need to be within network coverage before you can change your call for­
warding option. After you’re within network coverage, you can change your 
call forwarding settings by doing the following:
	
1.	Press the green send key.
	
	 The Phone application opens.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Options.
	
	 A list of phone options appears.
	
3.	Touch-press Call Forwarding.
	
	 Your BlackBerry attempts to connect to the server. If successful, you see 
the Call Forwarding screen.
	
	 If you don’t see the Call Forwarding screen, wait until you have network 
coverage and try again.
	
4.	Press the menu key and touch-press Edit Numbers.
	
	 A list of numbers appears. If this is the first time you’re setting call for­
warding, mostly likely your voice mail number is the only one in the list.
	
5.	To add a new forwarding number, press the menu key and touch-press 
New Number.
	
	 A pop-up menu prompts you to type the number.
	
6.	Type the number.
	
	 The new number you entered now appears in the call-forwarding list. 
You can add this new number to any call-forwarding types or conditions.
	
7.	Press the escape key.
	
	 You return to the Call Forwarding screen.
	
8.	Touch-press the If Unreachable field.
	
	 A drop-down menu lists numbers from the call-forwarding list, including 
the one you just added.
	
9.	Touch-press the number you want to forward to and then touch-press 
to confirm.
	
	 The selected number appears in the If Unreachable field. You can see 
this on the Call Forwarding screen.
	
10.	Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
	
	 Your changes are confirmed.

 Chapter 14: Calling Your Favorite Person
Arranging Conference Calls
To have two (or more) people on the phone with you — the infamous confer­
ence call — do the following:
	
1.	Use the Phone application to call the first person.
	
2.	While the first participant is on the phone with you, touch-press the 
Add Participant button on the screen (refer to Figure 14-3, earlier in 
this chapter).
	
	 This automatically places the first call on hold and brings up a New Call 
screen.
	
3.	Type the phone number of the second person.
	
	 You can dial the number by using the onscreen number pad, by select­
ing a number from your call log, or by accessing it from your Contacts.
	
4.	Press the green send key.
	
	 The call to the second meeting participant is just like any other phone 
call (except that the first participant is still on hold on the other line).
	
5.	While the second person is on the phone with you, press the menu 
key and touch-press Join Conference, as shown in Figure 14-4.
	
	 This connects the first and second participants. Now you can talk with 
both participants at the same time.
	
Figure 14-4: 
Join two 
people in a 
conference 
call.
	

234
Part III: Going Multimedia with Your Storm 
Having two people on the phone with you is also known as three-way calling. 
If you want to chat with four people — or even ten people — at the same 
time, you certainly can. Simply repeat Steps 2–5 until all the participants are 
on the phone.
Talking privately to a conference 
participant
During a conference call, you might want to talk to one person privately. This 
is called splitting your conference call. Here’s how you do it:
	
1.	While on a conference call, press the menu key and touch-press Split 
Call.
	
	 A pop-up screen lists all the conference-call participants.
	
2.	Touch-press the person you want to speak with privately.
	
	 This puts all other participants on hold and connects you to the par­
ticipant you selected. On the display screen, you can see who you’re 
connected to; this confirms that you chose the right person to chat with 
privately.
	
3.	To talk to all participants again, press the menu key and touch-press 
Join Conference.
Alternating between phone conversations
Whether you’re in a private conversation during a conference call or you’re 
talking to someone while you have someone else on hold, you can switch 
between the two conversations by swapping them. Follow these steps:
	
1.	While talking to someone, press the menu key and touch-press Hold.
	
	 That person is put on hold.
	
2.	Press the menu key and touch-press Swap.
	
	You switch from the person with whom you’re currently talking to the 
person who was on hold.
	
3.	Repeat Step 2 to go back to the original conversation.

235
 Chapter 14: Calling Your Favorite Person
Communicating Hands Free
More and more places prohibit the use of mobile phones without a hands-
free headset. Luckily for you, BlackBerry offers hands-free options.
Using the speaker phone
The speaker phone function is useful under certain situations, such as when 
you’re in a room full of people who want to join in the conversation. Or you 
might be all by your lonesome in your office but are stuck rooting through 
your files — hard to do with a BlackBerry scrunched up against your ear. (We 
call such moments multitasking — a concept so important that we devote an 
entire upcoming section to it.)
	
To switch to the speaker phone while you’re on a phone call, press the 
Speaker button onscreen (refer to Figure 14-3, earlier in this chapter).
Pairing your BlackBerry with 
a Bluetooth headset
Your Storm comes with a wired hands-free headset, so you can start using 
yours by plugging it into the headset jack on the right side of the Storm. You 
can adjust the headset’s volume by pressing the volume up or volume down 
keys.
Using the wired hands-free headset can help, but the wired headset can get in 
the way if you’re multitasking on your BlackBerry. The whole Bluetooth wire­
less thing comes in here. You can buy a Bluetooth headset to go with your 
Bluetooth-enabled BlackBerry.
After you purchase a Bluetooth headset, you can pair it with your BlackBerry 
Storm. Think of pairing a Bluetooth headset with your Storm as registering 
the headset with your Storm so that it recognizes the headset.
	
First things first: You need to prep your headset for pairing. Now, each head­
set manufacturer has a different take on this process, so consult your headset 
documentation for details.
With that out of the way, continue with the pairing as follows:

236
Part III: Going Multimedia with Your Storm 
	
1.	From the Home screen, press the menu key and touch-press 
Connection Manager.
	
	 A pop-up screen appears.
	
2.	Touch-press the Enable check box next to Bluetooth and then touch-
press Set Up Bluetooth.
	
	If this is the first time you’re using Bluetooth, you’re asked to set a name 
for your device so that others can see your Storm when trying to con­
nect to you via Bluetooth.
	
	 If this isn’t the first time, you see an Add Device pop-up screen with the 
following options:
 
• Search: If you want to reach out to other devices
 
• Listen: If you want other devices to find you.
 
• Cancel: If you want to cancel this operation
	
3.	Touch-press Search.
	
	 You see the Searching for Devices progress bar . . . um, progressing. 
When your BlackBerry discovers the headset, a Select Device dialog box 
appears with the name of the headset.
	
4.	Touch-press the Bluetooth headset.
	
	 A dialog box prompts you for a passkey code to the headset.
	
5.	Type the passkey and touch-press Okay.
	
	 Normally, the Bluetooth passkey is 0000, but refer to your headset docu­
mentation.
	
	 After you successfully enter the passkey, your headset is listed in the 
Bluetooth setting.
	
6.	Press the menu key and touch-press Connect.
	
	 Your BlackBerry attempts to connect to the Bluetooth headset.
Using your voice to dial
With your headset and the Voice Dialing application, you can truly be hands 
free. You may be wondering how to activate the Voice Dialing application 
without touching your BlackBerry. Good question. The majority of hands-free 
headsets (Bluetooth or not) come with a multipurpose button.
	
Usually, a multipurpose button on a hands-free headset can mute, end, and 
initiate a call. Refer to your hands-free headset’s manual for more info.

237
 Chapter 14: Calling Your Favorite Person
To use hands-free dialing:
	
1.	Activate your headset.
	
2.	Press its multipurpose button.
	
	 The Voice Dialing application is activated, and a voice states, “Say a 
command.”
	
3.	Say “Call name of person/number.”
	
The Voice Dialing application is good at recognizing the name of the person 
and the numbers you dictate. However, we strongly suggest that you try the 
voice dialing feature before you need it.
Taking Notes While on the Phone
You’re not stuck just talking to someone on the phone. When you’re on your 
BlackBerry, you can use it for other tasks at the same time. Why not
	
✓	Take meeting notes while you’re in a conference call?
	
✓	Look up (in BlackBerry Contacts) a phone number that your caller is 
asking you for?
	
✓	Make a to-do list while you’re planning a party?
	
✓	Compose an e-mail thanking the caller for his time?
It makes sense to multitask while you’re using a hands-free headset or a 
speaker phone. Otherwise, your face would be stuck to your BlackBerry.
After you don your hands-free headset or turn on a speaker phone, you can 
start multitasking:
	
1.	While in a conversation, from the Phone application, press the icon 
that looks like a house.
	
	 This gets you to the Home screen.
	
2.	Start multitasking.
	
	 While on the phone and multitasking, you can access the Phone menu 
from other applications. For example, you can end a call or put a call on 
hold from your to-do list.
Do this to take notes on your call:

238
Part III: Going Multimedia with Your Storm 
	
1.	During a phone conversation, press the menu key.
	
	 Or you can press the notepad icon (see the bottom of Figure 14-3, earlier 
in this chapter); if you do, then go to Step 3.
	
2.	Touch-press Notes.
	
	 The Notes screen appears.
	
3.	Type notes for the conversation, as shown in Figure 14-5.
	
	 When the call ends, the notes are automatically saved for you.
	
Figure 14-5: 
Take notes 
while on a 
phone call.
	
Accessing phone notes
From the Call History list, you can access notes you’ve made during a call. In 
addition, you can edit and add new notes. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Press the green send key.
	
	 The Phone application opens.
	
2.	Touch-press the call log tab and highlight a call log (see Figure 14-6).
	
3.	Press the menu key and touch-press View History.
	
	 The View Call Log opens for the highlighted call (see Figure 14-7).
	
4.	Press the menu key and choose one of the following:
 
• Add Notes: If the call has no notes
 
• Edit Notes: If the call already has notes

ing section), press the menu key.

240
Part III: Going Multimedia with Your Storm 
	
2.	Touch-press Forward.
	
	 A new e-mail opens, with the body of the e-mail filled with call details 
and notes. You can forward call notes via e-mail (no SMS or PIN mes­
sages). You can send the e-mail as you would any other e-mail. See 
Chapter 7 for more information on e-mail.
	
3.	Send the e-mail as you would send any other e-mail.
	
	See Chapter 7 for details on sending an e-mail.

In this part . . .
H
ere you discover essential information about some 
behind-the-scenes-yet-integral processes. Read all 
about BlackBerry Desktop Manager, which you direct to 
monitor and control database synchronization, and how 
to leverage Device Switch Wizard to migrate your existing

back up your data and the many ways of installing appli­
cations to your BlackBerry Storm.

Chapter 15
Syncing the Synchronize Way
In This Chapter
▶	Introducing BlackBerry Desktop Manager (PC and Mac)
▶	Preparing your desktop for PIM synchronization
▶	Using manual and automatic synchronization
W
hat better way to keep your BlackBerry Storm updated than to syn­
chronize it with your desktop application’s data? Arguably, most 
of the data you need to synchronize is from your personal information 
manager (PIM) applications: notes, appointments, contacts, and tasks. The 
crucial piece for data synchronization to and from your device and desktop 
computer is Synchronize. This software within BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
allows you to synchronize your PIM data as well as to upload and download 
media files between your PC and your smart phone.
In this chapter, you explore Synchronize and see how to manually and auto­
matically synchronize your Storm with your desktop computer. You find tips 
about which options you may want to use. Before delving into all that, how­
ever, we have a section on BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
If you’re a Mac user, good news! The folks at Research In Motion have finally 
rolled out a Mac version of BlackBerry Desktop Manager. You are no longer 
left to use PocketMac, which is way behind on features and capabilities com­
pared to its Windows cousin BlackBerry Desktop Manager. In this book, we 
show you how to use BlackBerry Desktop Manager on both Windows PC and 
Mac.
	
If you’re using a corporate BlackBerry Storm that’s running under BlackBerry 
Enterprise Server, you can skip this chapter. BlackBerry smart phones running 
under BlackBerry Enterprise Server synchronize over the air (OTA), via serial 
bypass, or wirelessly.

244
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
Data Synchronization on a Windows PC
BlackBerry Desktop Manager is the centerpiece of desktop activities, such 
as data synchronization, switching smart phones, and data backup on the 
BlackBerry.
BlackBerry Desktop Manager under Windows is a suite of programs that 
includes the following:
	
✓	Application Loader: Installs BlackBerry applications and updates the 
BlackBerry OS.
	
✓	Backup and Restore: Backs up your Storm data and settings. Check out 
Chapter 17 for details.
	
✓	Synchronize: Synchronizes Storm data with your PC (um, the topic of 
this chapter).
	
✓	Media Manager: Uploads media files to your Storm from your PC and 
vice versa (another topic in this chapter).
	
✓	Device Switch Wizard: Helps you transfer data from your existing 
mobile device to your Storm. See Chapter 16 for details.
BlackBerry Desktop Manager is software loaded on the CD that comes with 
your Storm. Your Storm’s packaging provides instructions on how to install 
BlackBerry Desktop Manager on your desktop computer. For corporate 
users, check with your BlackBerry system administrator for details.
Installing BlackBerry Desktop Manager and Desktop Redirector
As we mention in the preceding section, use the CD that comes with your 
Storm to install BlackBerry Desktop Manager on your PC. At the same time, 
you can install Desktop Redirector. Desktop Redirector allows you to redirect 
e-mail that you receive in Outlook. This means that even if you get e-mails 
through Outlook (such as work e-mails), you can have those e-mails redi­
rected to your Storm. (Read more about configuring e-mails in Chapter 7.)
	
Only e-mails from mailboxes connected to your Outlook mailbox are redi­
rected. Your PC and the redirector must run all the time to keep redirection 
active.
When you insert the CD, the installation wizard runs automatically. Follow 
the onscreen instructions. On one of the wizard screens, you choose whether 
this installation is for personal e-mail or work e-mail. Choosing the option 
for work e-mail enables you to use Desktop Redirector for both personal and 
work e-mail.

245
 Chapter 15: Syncing the Synchronize Way
	
If you aren’t using a corporate BlackBerry Enterprise Server and want to redirect 
your Outlook e-mail to your Storm, when you’re installing BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager, make sure that you select the Redirect Messages Using the BlackBerry 
Desktop Redirector option on the installation screen, as shown in Figure 15-1.
	
Figure 15-1: 
Configure 
the

to include 
Desktop 
Redirector.
	
	
If your Storm is running under a corporate BlackBerry Enterprise Server, your 
e-mail is already redirected to your smart phone wirelessly, and choosing the 
BlackBerry Desktop Redirector could really mess things up. So don’t do it! 
Most companies are protective of corporate data, including your work e-mails. 
Make sure you aren’t violating your company’s policy before you decide to 
redirect your work e-mails to your personal BlackBerry.
Launching BlackBerry Desktop Manager
In most Windows installations, you find the shortcut to launch BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager through your computer’s Start menu. Follow these steps to 
launch BlackBerry Desktop Manager:
	
1.	Choose Start➪All Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop Manager.
	
2.	Connect your Storm to your computer using the USB cable that came 
with your device.
	
	 With the microSD card in your Storm, upon connecting to your PC, your 
Storm displays a prompt for enabling mass storage mode. It also asks for 
your Storm’s password when you answer Yes to the prompt. Answer Yes 
and enter your password, and your Storm will behave like a flash drive. 
A drive letter will be added to My Computer (or just plain Computer in 
Microsoft Vista) in Windows Explorer, allowing you to treat the microSD 
card as a normal flash drive.

246
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
	
3.	Launch BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
	
	 The BlackBerry Desktop Manager opening screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 15-2.
	
Figure 15-2: 
BlackBerry 
Desktop 
Manager 
under 
Windows.
	
BlackBerry Desktop Manager installation can vary from phone provider to 
provider. You should see at least the following four icons, or applications:
	
✓	Application Loader (see Chapter 18)
	
✓	Backup and Restore (see Chapter 17)
	
✓	Media (see Chapter 12)
	
✓	Synchronize
Connecting BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager to your Storm
You establish a connection between your Storm and BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager through the USB cable. After BlackBerry Desktop Manager is running, 
it tries to find a BlackBerry (your Storm) on the type of connection specified. 
The default connection is USB, so you shouldn’t need to configure anything.
Follow these steps to connect your Storm to BlackBerry Desktop Manager:
	
1.	Plug your device into your desktop computer.
	
	 Keep your device on.

247
 Chapter 15: Syncing the Synchronize Way
	
2.	Launch BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
	
	 BlackBerry Desktop Manager tries to find a BlackBerry (your Storm) on 
a USB connection.
	
3.	If your device has a password, BlackBerry Desktop Manager prompts 
you for the password.
	
4.	Enter the password.
	
	 You see Connected as the screen heading. If, for some reason, you 
see Disconnected and no password prompt, one of the following is 
happening:
 
• BlackBerry Desktop Manager can’t find the device being con­
nected via the USB cable. Make sure that the USB cable is properly 
attached at both ends.
 
• The connection setting isn’t set to use USB. To check this connec­
tivity setting, go to Step 5.
	
5.	Choose Options➪Connection Options on the right side of the 
BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen.
	
	 The screen shown in Figure 15-3 appears. Make sure that the connection 
setting uses USB.
	
6.	From the Connection Type drop-down list, select the USB connection 
with your Storm’s PIN.

Running BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager for the first time
If you’re running BlackBerry Desktop Manager for the first time, the program 
does the following:
	
✓	Tries to make the initial configuration on your machine, which includes 
security encryption setup. It may ask you to randomly move your mouse 
to generate security encryption keys.

248
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
	
✓	Checks which applications are on your device and which required appli­
cations need to be installed. If it can’t find a required application on 
your device, it prompts you to install it. You have the option to cancel 
and install later.
	
✓	Looks at the settings you have for your Synchronize software. If auto­
synchronization is turned on, BlackBerry Desktop Manager attempts 
to run synchronization for your PIM. This is discussed in the section 
“Synchronizing automatically,” later in this chapter.
Setting Up Synchronize 
on a Windows PC
Synchronize is the part of BlackBerry Desktop Manager that allows you to 
synchronize your data between your desktop computer and the Storm. (If 
the Storm is running on BlackBerry Enterprise Server, your data is already 
synced wirelessly, so you don’t need your desktop for synchronization.) The 
Synchronize icon on the BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen appears with two 
opposing arrows on top of two paper images. To launch Synchronize, simply 
double-click its icon. A screen like the one shown in Figure 15-4 appears.
	
Figure 15-4: 
The 
Synchronize 
screen.
	
The Synchronize screen is divided into two sections. You can navigate 
through the links on the left side:
	
✓	Synchronize (the default view) allows you to manually trigger synchro­
nization. (Refer to Figure 15-4.) See the “Using on-demand synchroniza­
tion” and “Synchronizing automatically” sections, later in this chapter, 
for more details and for when you use this screen.

249
 Chapter 15: Syncing the Synchronize Way
	
✓	Configuration is where you can set up configuration and rules for 
reconciling data. Under the Configuration link are two subsections, 
Synchronization and Add-ins. These further help you organize the inter­
face. Most of the configuration options you want to set are accessible 
through the Synchronization Configuration screen, which is shown in 
Figure 15-5. The following section helps you do that.
	
Figure 15-5: 
The 
Synchro­

Configuring PIM synchronization
The important item in the Synchronization Configuration subsection, as 
shown in Figure 15-5, is the Synchronization button. You use that button to 
configure PIM synchronization.
Click the Synchronization button to display the screen shown in Figure 15-6. 
You can see that the names correspond to BlackBerry Storm applications, 
except for Contacts, which goes by the name Address Book. This screen is 
the entry point for the entire synchronization configuration for PIM applica­
tions. Selecting an application on this screen allows you to pair the PIM hand­
held application with a desktop application (most likely Outlook).
From the PIM configuration screen, select which application data you want to 
sync with your Storm. The following popular PIM applications can be synced 
to your Storm: ACT!, ASCII Text File Converter, Lotus Notes, Lotus Organizer, 
Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Microsoft Schedule.

250
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
	
Figure 15-6: 
The PIM 
configura-
tion screen.
	
The types of application data that can be synchronized to your Storm are
	
✓	Calendar: Synchronize the appointments and events stored in your 
favorite PIM application.
	
✓	MemoPad: Synchronize any notes or text that you have been storing in 
your PIM application.
	
✓	Address Book: Synchronize any contact information with your Storm.
	
✓	Tasks: Synchronize your to-do list.
Follow these steps to set up your device’s synchronization:
	
1.	Connect your Storm to BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
	
2.	Click the Synchronize icon and then click the Synchronization link.
	
	 (The Synchronization link is below the Configuration link on the left side 
of the screen; refer to Figure 15-5, earlier in this chapter.)
	
3.	Click the Synchronization button.
	
4.	Select the check box next to the application data type (Calendar, 
MemoPad, Address Book, or Tasks) that you want to synchronize.
	
	For this example, select the Calendar application data type.
	
5.	Click the Setup button.
	
	 This opens the screen for the application — in this case, the Calendar 
Setup screen.

251
 Chapter 15: Syncing the Synchronize Way
	
6.	Select a PIM application from which to retrieve application data by 
clicking your desired application.
	
	 BlackBerry Desktop Manager pulls your selected application data from 
the application selected on this screen. In Figure 15-7, we selected 
Microsoft Outlook. This means that when we synchronize the Storm, 
BlackBerry Desktop Manager retrieves Calendar data from Microsoft 
Outlook.
	
Figure 15-7: 
Choose the 
desktop 
application 
here.
	
	
7.	Click Next.
	
8.	 On the Synchronization Options screen that opens, select which direc­
tion the synchronization will follow (see Figure 15-8).
	
	 Here are the three available synchronization options:
	
•	Two Way Sync allows you to synchronize changes in both your 
Storm and in your desktop application.
	
• One Way Sync from Device synchronizes only the changes made to 
your Storm. Changes to your desktop application aren’t reflected 
in your Storm.
	
•	One Way Sync to Device synchronizes changes made in your desk­
top application with your Storm. Any changes made in your Storm 
aren’t reflected in your desktop application.
	
9.	Click Next.
	
	 The Options screen opens for the PIM application you selected in Step 6. 
Figure 15-9 shows the Microsoft Outlook Options screen.

This is particularly pertinent in cases in which you have multiple user 
profiles in your computer. Choosing the wrong one may put the wrong 
data into your Storm.
	
	 You can also control the amount of data that is reconciled or synchro­
nized in a given application. For example, in Figure 15-9, the center por­
tion of the configuration allows you to specify whether to transfer all 
Calendar items, a set of appointments in the future, or items within a 
range of dates you enter.

 Chapter 15: Syncing the Synchronize Way
	
	 Select the Remove Alarm for Past Items check box if you don’t want to 
keep the alarm setting for events that have already occurred.
	
10.	Click Next and then click Finish.
	
	 Clicking the Next button brings you to the Calendar Setup Finish screen, 
and clicking the Finish button completes the configuration of the 
Calendar synchronization you selected.
Mapping fields for synchronization
For all four PIM applications, Synchronize is intelligent enough to know what 
information — such as names, phone numbers, and addresses in Contacts — 
corresponds to information in Outlook. A specific bit of information, or 
attribute, is a field. For instance, the value of a home-phone-number field in 
Contacts needs to be mapped to the corresponding field in Outlook so that 
information is transferred correctly.
But not all fields on the desktop side exist on the smart phone (and vice versa). 
For example, a Nick Name field doesn’t exist in Storm Contacts but is available 
in Exchange (Outlook) Address Book. In some instances, Synchronize provides 
an alternative field and lets you decide whether to map it.
If you ever need to change the default mapping, you can. The interface is the 
same for all PIM applications. We use Contacts as our example in the follow­
ing steps as we illustrate how to map and unmap fields:
	
1.	From BlackBerry Desktop Manager, click the Synchronize link.
	
	 The Synchronize screen appears.
	
2.	Click the Synchronization link.
	
3.	Click the Synchronize button.
	
	 The PIM configuration screen appears (refer to Figure 15-6, earlier in this 
chapter).
	
4.	Select the Address Book check box.
	
	 The Advanced button is enabled.
	
5.	Click the Advanced button.
	
	 The Advanced screen opens, as shown in Figure 15-10.
	
6.	Click the Map Fields button.
	
	 The Map Fields screen for the Address Book/Contacts application 
appears; see Figure 15-11. To map or unmap, click the arrow icons.

	 If you aren’t careful, you can inadvertently unclick a mapping (such as 
Job Title), and suddenly your titles aren’t in sync. Double-check your 
mapping before you click OK. If you think you made a mistake, click 
Cancel to save yourself from having to restore settings.
	
7.	Click OK to save your changes.
Confirming record changes
Face facts: Doing a desktop synchronization isn’t a very interesting task, and 
few people perform it on a regular basis.
You can tell Synchronize to prompt you for any changes it’s trying to make 
(or perhaps undo) on either side of the fence. The Advanced screen comes 
into the picture here. To get to this view, follow these steps:
	
1.	From BlackBerry Desktop Manager, click the Synchronize link.
	
	 The Synchronize screen appears.
	
2.	 Click the Synchronization link.
	
3.	Click the Synchronize button.
	
	 The PIM configuration screen appears (refer to Figure 15-6, earlier in this 
chapter).
	
4.	Select the Address Book check box.
	
	 If you want a PIM application other than Address Book, select that appli­
cation from the list.
	
5.	Click the Advanced button.
	
	 The Advanced screen for Address Book appears (refer to Figure 15-10, 
in the preceding section). This screen has a Confirmations section and 
gives you two options:
 
• Confirm Record Deletions (Recommended)
 
• Confirm Changes and Additions (Recommended)
	
	 Regardless of whether you select the first option, Synchronize displays a 
prompt if it detects that it’s about to delete all records.
Resolving update conflicts
Synchronize needs to know how you want to handle any conflicts between 
your Storm and your desktop application. A conflict normally happens when 
the same record is updated on your Storm and also in Outlook. Suppose that 

256
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
you change Jane Doe’s mobile number on both the Storm and Outlook on the 
PC. Where you resolve these conflicts is the same for all PIM applications. 
Again, for illustration, we use Address Book as an example:
	
1.	From BlackBerry Desktop Manager, click the Synchronize link.
	
	 The Synchronize screen appears.
	
2.	Click the Synchronization link.
	
3.	Click the Synchronize button.
	
	 The PIM configuration screen appears (refer to Figure 15-6, earlier in this 
chapter).
	
4.	Select the Address Book check box.
	
	 If you want a PIM application other than Address Book, select that appli­
cation from the list.
	
5.	Click the Advanced button.
	
	 The Advanced screen for Address Book appears (refer to Figure 15-10, 
earlier in this chapter). This screen has five sections, and the third sec­
tion is Conflict Resolution.
	
6.	Click the Conflict Resolution button.
	
	 The Conflict Resolution screen is shown in Figure 15-12. From the 
Conflict Resolution screen, you can tell Synchronize to handle conflicts 
in a few ways. Here are the options:
	
Figure 15-12: 
Manage 
conflicts 
here.
	
 
• Add All Conflicting Items: When a conflict happens, add a new 
record to the Storm for the changes on the desktop and add a new 
record to the desktop for the changes on the Storm.
 
• Ignore All Conflicting Items: Ignores the change and keeps the data 
the same on both sides.
 
• Notify Me When Conflicts Occur: This option is the safest. 
Synchronize displays the details of the conflict and lets you resolve it.

257
 Chapter 15: Syncing the Synchronize Way
 
• Device Wins: This option tells Synchronize to disregard the 
changes in the desktop and use handheld changes every time it 
encounters a conflict. Unless you are sure that this is the case, you 
should not choose this option.
 
• Microsoft Outlook Wins: If you aren’t using MS Outlook, this option 
is based on your application. This option tells Synchronize to 
always discard changes on the smart phone and use the desktop 
application change when it encounters a conflict. We don’t recom­
mend this option because there’s no telling on which side you 
made the good update.
	
7.	Select the option you want.
	
8.	Click OK to save the settings.
Ready, set, synchronize!
Are you ready to synchronize? Previously in this chapter, we show you ways 
to define synchronization filters and rules for your e-mail and PIM data. Now 
it’s time to be brave and click the button. You can synchronize in one of two 
ways:
	
✓	Manually: Click the Synchronize Now icon.
	
✓	Automatically: Choose How Often on the calendar.
Using on-demand synchronization
On-demand synchronization is a feature in Synchronize that lets you run syn­
chronization manually. Remember that even if you set up automatic synchro­
nization, actual synchronization doesn’t happen right away. So if you make 
updates to your appointments in Outlook while your Storm is connected to 
your PC, this feature allows you to be sure that your updates make it to your 
Storm before heading out the door.
Without delay, here are the steps:
	
1.	From BlackBerry Desktop Manager, click the Synchronize link.
	
	 The Synchronize screen appears (refer to Figure 15-4, earlier in this 
chapter). The following four check boxes let you be selective:
 
• Reconcile Messages: You want to synchronize your e-mails 
between Outlook and your Storm.
 
• Synchronize Organizer Data: You want to include notes, appoint­
ments, addresses, and tasks.
 
• Run Add-In Actions: You have third-party applications that require 
data synchronization between your PC and your Storm.

258
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
 
• Update Device Date and Time: You want both the PC and Storm 
to have the same time. This ensures that you’re reminded of your 
appointments at the same time for both Outlook and your Storm.
	
2.	Select the check boxes for the data you want to synchronize.
	
3.	Click the Synchronize button.
	
	 Synchronize starts running the synchronization, and you see a progress 
screen. If you set up prompts for conflicts, and Synchronize encounters 
one, a screen appears so that you can resolve that conflict. When fin­
ished, the progress screen disappears and the Synchronize screen 
reappears.
	
	 If you turned on automatic synchronization (see the next section), the 
items you select in Step 2 automatically sync every time you connect 
your Storm to your PC.
	
4.	Click the Close button.
Synchronizing automatically
How many times do you think you reconfigure your Synchronize setup? 
Rarely, right? After you have it configured, that’s it. And if you’re like us, 
the reason you open BlackBerry Desktop Manager is to run Synchronize. So 
opening Synchronize and clicking the Synchronize button are annoying.
	
To make Synchronize run automatically every time you connect your 
Storm to your PC, simply make sure that you select the last check box on 
the Synchronize screen (refer to Figure 15-4, earlier in this chapter) — 
Synchronize the Selected Items When Your Device Is Connected to the 
BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
You may be asking, “What items will autosynchronization sync?” Good ques­
tion. Synchronize automatically syncs the items you selected in the top por­
tion of the Synchronize screen. Note that if you make a change, selecting or 
deselecting an item on the Synchronize screen, only the selected items will 
be synced automatically the next time you connect your Storm to your PC.
Data Synchronization on the Mac
The focus of your Mac activities — such as data synchronization and data 
backup on the BlackBerry — is BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
BlackBerry Desktop Manager for Mac has been a highly anticipated software 
program for a good reason: Folks in the Mac world have been waiting for 

259
 Chapter 15: Syncing the Synchronize Way
a replacement of PocketMac, which is limited in functionality. BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager for Mac is fairly new, and if it doesn’t come with your Storm 
packaging, no worries; you can download an installation program from RIM’s 
Web site.
Installing BlackBerry Desktop Manager
We’re assuming that you’re not holding a CD of BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
for Mac, so in this section, we include the download steps. Here is a quick 
rundown on how to go about installing the application:
	
1.	Download the BlackBerry Desktop Manager installation file from 
http://na.blackberry.com/eng/services/desktop/desktop_
mac.jsp.
	
2.	On the download page, fill in the form and click Download.
	
	 After the file is downloaded, the screen showing two icons (BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager.mpkg and BlackBerry Desktop Manager Uninstaller) 
appears.
	
3.	Double-click BlackBerry Desktop Manager.mpkg.
	
	 A standard Mac warning message appears, telling you that you’re about 
to run an installation of a program.
	
4.	Click Continue on the warning screen.
	
	 Another warning message appears. This time, the message tells you that 
PocketMac or the Missing Sync software will no longer be able to con­
nect to your BlackBerry. Hey, you’re probably installing the BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager because you’re itching to replace PocketMac or the 
Missing Sync, so no worries there.
	
5.	Click Install Anyway.
	
	 An installation welcome screen appears.
	
6.	Click Continue.
	
	 Another prompt appears, this time asking you to agree to the license 
agreement.
	
7.	Click Agree.
	
	 A screen appears, allowing you to choose the location of the install. The 
default is your Mac’s hard drive.
	
8.	Click Continue.
	
	 You’re prompted for your Mac password.

260
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
	
9.	Enter your Mac password and click OK.
	
	 Before the installation starts, a screen appears, telling you that when the 
installation finishes, you need to restart your Mac.
	
10.	Click Continue Installation.
	
	 At this point, the installation kicks in. This may take a minute or two. 
When the installation is complete, you see a message to restart the Mac.
	
11.	Click Restart.
Opening BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager for the first time
BlackBerry Desktop Manager will not be on your Mac’s Dock (the bottom 
bar with application icons on Mac OS 10.5 or later) or on your Mac’s desktop 
after your installation. You need to use the Finder app to locate it:
	
1.	If you have Mac OS 10.5 or later:
	
a.	Click the Finder application (the leftmost icon) on your Mac’s 
Dock.
	
	The Finder is launched with a screen displaying your Mac file 
system.
	
b.	In the search text box (topmost-right corner) of the Finder 
screen, type BlackBerry Desktop.
	
	The listing on the screen is the result of your search, and 
BlackBerry Desktop Manager is at the top of the list.
	
2.	If you have Mac OS prior to 10.5:
	
a.	Press Command+F to launch the Find utility.
	
	The Find utility of the Finder application opens.
	
b.	In the Find text box of the Find screen, type BlackBerry Desktop.
	
	The listing on the screen is the result of your search, and 
BlackBerry Desktop Manager is at the top of the list.
	
3.	Connect your BlackBerry Storm to your Mac.
	
4.	Click BlackBerry Desktop Manager in the Finder screen.
	
	 The screen in Figure 15-13 appears, displaying the BlackBerry connected 
to your Mac. In your case, it displays your Storm’s PIN.

Synchronizing, Mac Style
Synchronizing PIM data and music files is what most of us look for when 
talking about BlackBerry Desktop Manager. Just follow the succeeding short 
sections as we delve into the details on configuring the sync, doing a manual 
sync, and doing an automatic sync.
Setting synchronization options
You need to set synchronization options probably only once, but let’s 
make sure you get them right. After all, the data between the Mac and the 
BlackBerry Storm should be synced the way you want it.
Device Options
At the bottom center of the BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen (refer to 
Figure 15-13, in the preceding section) is a Device Options button. Click this 
button, and you get the screen shown in Figure 15-14.
An important option you need to set is This Device Is Synchronized. If you sync 
your Storm with other machines or even if you have Google Sync for Calendars 
and Contacts, we advice that you choose With Other Computers. This ensures 
that the automatic sync option is disabled. One side effect of automatic sync is 
creating duplicate contacts on your Storm and your other desktop machines. 
However, if you sync Storm only with this Mac, select With This Computer Only.

262
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
	
Figure 15-14: 
Decide 
whether you 
want your 
Storm to 
sync only on 
this Mac.
	
The listing on the left (under the Summary heading) contains links for navigat­
ing to the option screens. We describe each option in the following sections.
Calendar
Clicking the Calendar link on the BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen dis­
plays the screen shown in Figure 15-15. You can configure how your appoint­
ments are synced as follows:
	
✓	Sync Calendar: Include Calendar in the sync by selecting Two Way, or 
skip it by choosing Do Not Sync.
	
	A quick way to know that you set Calendar for Two Way sync is seeing 
two circular arrow icons next to the Calendar link on the left side of the 
BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen. This is true for Contacts, Notes, 
Tasks, and Music as well.
	
✓	Sync: This section applies only if you have multiple calendar applica­
tions on your Mac. You can include all calendars or choose one from the 
list. Your Storm handles the display of multiple calendar applications. 
The Storm Calendar app uses different colors to indicate which calendar 
an appointment belongs to.
	
✓	Add Events Created on BlackBerry Device To: The default Calendar on 
your Storm does not tie directly to any Mac applications. Appointments 
you create in your BlackBerry will not be synced to any Mac applica­
tions. Setting this option tells BlackBerry Desktop Manager to sync 
those appointments or events to a particular Mac application.
	
✓	(Advanced Settings) Sync: This setting allows you to limit the amount of 
appointments or events to sync on your Storm. After all, past events just 
occupy valuable space on your smart phone with no purpose but a record. 
Here, you can control which ones your Storm carries. Choose All Events 
(the default), Only Future Events, or Only Events n Days Prior and n Days 

263
 Chapter 15: Syncing the Synchronize Way
After. The last option allows you to have a range of dates relative to the cur­
rent day. The default is 14 days in the past and 90 days after.
	
✓	(Advanced Settings) Replace All Calendar Events on This BlackBerry 
Device: Keep this deselected unless you want a fresh start and want to 
copy to your Storm appointments or events from your Mac.
	
Figure 15-15: 
Configure 
Calendar 
sync here.
	
Contacts
The Contacts link on the BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen displays the 
screen shown in Figure 15-16. Here, you can do the following:
	
✓	Sync Contacts: Choose to include Contacts in the sync by selecting Two 
Way. Otherwise, select Do Not Sync.
	
✓	Sync: Choose here to include all contacts and groups on syncing or click 
Selected Groups to sync only the groups you want.
	
✓	(Advanced Settings) Replace All Contacts on This BlackBerry Device: 
Keep this deselected unless you want a fresh start and want to copy all 
contacts from your Mac to your smart phone.
Notes
The Notes link on the BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen displays the 
screen shown in Figure 15-17. This screen is where you configure how you 
want Notes or MemoPad items on your Storm synced:

264
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
	
✓	Sync Notes: Lets you configure whether or not you want Notes included 
in the sync. Choose Two Way or Do Not Sync (the default).
	
✓	Sync Account: If you have multiple note-keeping programs in your Mac, 
this setting allows you to choose which one you want to tie the sync 
into. The default is Apple Mail Notes.
	
✓	(Advanced Settings) Replace All Notes on This BlackBerry Device: If 
you select this option, the Mac side becomes your master. Keep this 
deselected unless you want a fresh start and want to copy to your Storm 
all notes from your Mac.
Tasks
Clicking the Tasks link on the BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen displays 
the screen shown in Figure 15-18. Note that the screen is similar to Calendar 
because most of the Tasks items have associated dates and are essentially tied 
to your Calendar. You can configure how your tasks are synced as follows:
	
✓	Sync Tasks: Choose to include Tasks in the sync (Two Way) or not (Do 
Not Sync).
	
✓	Sync: This section applies only if you have multiple calendar applica­
tions on your Mac. You can include all calendars or choose one of those 
listed. Your Storm handles the display of multiple calendar applications. 
The Storm Calendar app uses different colors to indicate which calendar 
an appointment belongs to.

266
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
	
✓	Add Tasks Created on BlackBerry Device To: The default Calendar on 
your Storm does not tie into any Mac application. Tasks you created 
in your BlackBerry will not be synced to any of your Mac applications. 
Setting this option tells BlackBerry Desktop Manager to sync those tasks 
to a particular Mac application.
	
✓	(Advanced Settings) Sync: This setting allows you to limit the tasks to 
sync on your Storm so that the tasks that are completed don’t simply 
occupy valuable space on your smart phone with no real purpose. 
Choose either All Tasks (the default) or Only Uncompleted Tasks.
	
✓	(Advanced Settings) Replace All Tasks on This BlackBerry Device: 
Keep this deselected unless you want a fresh start, deleting current 
calendar items in your smart phone and copying all appointments or 
events from your Mac.
Music
You can easily sync your iTunes playlists to the BlackBerry by using the 
Music link on the BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen. And this is the place 
to configure how you want it synced, as you can see in Figure 15-19.
	
Figure 15-19: 
Configure 
Music sync 
here.
	

267
 Chapter 15: Syncing the Synchronize Way
Here, you can choose the following:
	
✓	Sync Music: Choose to include Music in the sync or not. Just below this 
check box, you have options to sync All Songs and Playlists (the default) 
or Selected Playlists. If you have a big music library in iTunes, we recom­
mend that you choose Selected Playlists and choose only the music you 
want to carry with you, up to the capacity of your media card.
	
✓	Add Random Music to Free Space: If you want BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager to sync random songs from iTunes that are not included 
in your playlist, select this check box. You can find the songs in the 
Random Music playlist in the Music application of your Storm.
	
✓	Memory Settings: Choose where you want your music stored in your 
Storm. Values are Device Memory and Media Card (the default). We 
recommend the default setting because music files can take up a lot of 
space, and the device memory is fairly limited and something you want 
reserved for the use of other BlackBerry applications.
Some useful information on this screen is related to the memory space of 
your smart phone so you have some idea how much memory your playlist is 
occupying and how much free space is left on your device.
Deleting all music files on your Storm
You might be wondering why we bother to include a section on deleting 
music files. What does deleting music files have to do with data synchroniza­
tion? This is the first time you installed and ran BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
on your Mac. With BlackBerry Desktop Manager, you have the option to sync 
your Storm with iTunes playlists, including album art. It makes sense to start 
fresh and clear your Storm of whatever music files it has.
To do a one-time delete of all music files on your Storm:
	
1.	Connect your Storm to your Mac.
	
2.	On your Mac, click BlackBerry Desktop Manager on the Dock or on 
the desktop.
	
	 If you have Mac OS 10.5 or later and can’t find BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager on the Dock:
 	
a.	Click the Finder application (the leftmost icon) on your Mac’s Dock.
	
b.	In the search text box (topmost-right corner) of the Finder 
screen, type BlackBerry Desktop.
	
c.	Connect your BlackBerry Storm to your Mac.
	
d.	Click BlackBerry Desktop Manager in the Finder screen.

268
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
	
	 If you have Mac OS prior to 10.5 and can’t find BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager on your desktop:
 	
a.	Press Command+F to launch the Find utility.
	
b.	In the Find text box of the Find screen, type BlackBerry Desktop.
	
c.	Connect your BlackBerry Storm to your Mac.
	
d.	Click BlackBerry Desktop Manager in the Find screen.
	
3.	Click the Device Options button.
	
4.	Click the Media icon.
	
5.	Click Delete.
	
	 A confirmation prompt asks whether you really want to delete your 
music files on the device.
	
6.	Click OK.
Doing a manual sync
Ready to sync? You’ve chosen the sync configuration you want. If you 
haven’t, make sure to read the sections preceding this one.
To do a manual sync, click the Sync button, which is located in the top-right 
corner of the BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen. If this is your first attempt 
running the sync, you’ll see the prompt shown in Figure 15-20. BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager needs to establish the latest copy of your data, and to do 
that, it needs to know how you want to proceed:
	
✓	Merge Data: Click this button if you want BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
to merge your Mac to your Storm data. Merging is basically combining 
two sets of data with no duplicate checking. If you have synced your 
Mac before, using a different type of software such as PocketMac, you 
will end up with duplicates.
	
✓	Replace Device Data: Click this button if you want to have a fresh copy 
of Mac data on your smart phone. After the sync, your Storm data will 
be the same as what you have on your Mac.

Configuring an automatic sync
It’s annoying to click the Sync button every time you want to sync. Simply 
follow these steps, and every time you connect the Storm to the Mac, the 
sync will occur automatically:
	
1.	Connect the Storm to the Mac.
	
2.	On the Mac, click BlackBerry Desktop Manager on the Dock.
	
3.	Click the Device Options button.
	
4.	Select Automatically Sync When Device Is Connected.
	
5.	Click OK.

ouldn’t it be nice if you could just make one device’s data available to 
another? That’s the future. But right now, RIM (Research In Motion) 
wants to make switching devices as painless as possible. That’s why Device 
Switch Wizard is part of the suite of applications in BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager.
Device Switch exists only in the Windows version of BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager. If you are a Mac user, you may skip this chapter.
Switching to a New BlackBerry
Switching from an older BlackBerry to your new Storm is no big deal. When 
you want to transfer application data (e-mails and contacts, for example) to 
your new Storm, Device Switch Wizard backs up your old BlackBerry and 
loads that backup to your new device.
On your PC, the following steps help you transition from your old device to 
your new BlackBerry Storm:
	
1.	On your PC, choose Start➪All Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop 
Manager.
	
	 The Desktop Manager screen opens, displaying Device Switch Wizard, as 
shown in Figure 16-1.

2.	Click the Device Switch Wizard icon.
	
	 The Device Switch Wizard screen lets you choose whether to switch 
from BlackBerry to BlackBerry Storm or from non-BlackBerry to 
BlackBerry Storm. The BlackBerry-to-BlackBerry section tells you to 
connect your current (old) BlackBerry to your PC.
	
3.	Connect your old BlackBerry to your PC with the USB cable.
	
	 Keep your BlackBerry on when connecting.
	
4.	Click the Start button below Switch BlackBerry Devices.
	
	 The next screen lets you verify the PINs for both devices — the old 
BlackBerry on the left and your new Storm on the right, as shown in 
Figure 16-2. Because you connected only your old BlackBerry, its PIN 
should be preselected.

 Chapter 16: Switching Devices
	
	 Your BlackBerry PIN isn’t a password; it’s your BlackBerry smart phone 
identifier. You can find the PIN by choosing Options➪Status on your 
BlackBerry.
	
5.	Decide whether to include user data and third-party applications and 
then click Next.
	
	 If you want all the data, leave the screen untouched; this backs up every­
thing. Third-party applications are all the programs you installed — the 
ones that didn’t come with the device originally.
	
	 Some older BlackBerry applications cater to keyboard, trackwheel, and 
trackballs, and might not work on the Storm. At first, include user data 
only, not third-party applications.
	
	 A status screen appears, showing the progress of the backup operation. 
When the backup is finished, the next screen prompts you to connect 
your new BlackBerry Storm.
	
6.	Connect your BlackBerry Storm to your PC with the USB cable.
	
	 The next screen, shown in Figure 16-3, lets you verify that your Storm 
is connected properly, with your Storm’s PIN preselected in the drop-
down list. It also asks for the password. Because data is already backed 
up from the old BlackBerry, it doesn’t matter whether you keep the old 
device connected in succeeding steps.

7.	Enter the password of your Storm and then click OK.
	
	 A screen similar to Figure 16-4 tells you what will be restored to the new 
device. Nothing has been done to your new BlackBerry Storm yet, and 
this is your last chance to cancel the process.

Switching from a Non-BlackBerry Device
This section is applicable only to Windows. BlackBerry Desktop Manager on 
the Mac shows support only for BlackBerry devices.
Device Switch Wizard supports two types of non-BlackBerry devices:
	
✓	Palm
	
✓	Microsoft Windows Mobile
This doesn’t mean you can’t import your old data if you have another device; 
Device Switch Wizard just makes it simpler for these two types of devices. 
Check Chapter 15 for synchronization options for your desktop PIM applica­
tion if your old device is neither a Palm nor a Microsoft Windows Mobile.
Palm device requirements
Your PC and Palm have to meet three prerequisites for Device Switch Wizard 
to import data from Palm to your BlackBerry Storm:
	
✓	Your PC must be running Windows 2000 or later.
	
✓	One of the following Palm Desktop Software versions must be installed 
on your desktop: 4.0.1, 4.1, 4.1.4, or 6.0.1.
	
✓	The installed Palm Desktop software is synchronizing properly with the 
Palm device.

275
 Chapter 16: Switching Devices
You can check your Palm user guide for more details about your Palm device 
and synchronizing it to your PC. You can also download the user guide from 
www.palm.com/us/support/index.hml. Navigate to this page by select­
ing the Palm model you have and the wireless network provider on which it 
runs.
Windows Mobile device requirements
You need the following for Device Switch Wizard to work properly with a 
Windows Mobile device:
	
✓	Your PC must be running Windows 2000 or later.
	
✓	Microsoft ActiveSync versions must be installed on your PC.
	
✓	The mobile device must run one of the following operating systems: 
Microsoft Windows Mobile 2000, 2002, 2003, 2003SE, or 2005/5.0 for 
Pocket PC; or Microsoft Windows Mobile SmartPhone software 2002, 
2003, or 2003 SE.
Run the wizard
Before you run the wizard, make sure that all the requirements for your 
device are in place.
	
We recommend hot-syncing or synchronizing your Palm or Windows Mobile 
device; this ensures that the data you’re sending to your Storm is current. 
Palm Desktop Software, as well as Microsoft ActiveSync, should come with 
help information on how to hot-sync.
Although the following steps migrate Windows Mobile data to the Storm, the 
steps are similar for Palm as well. We indicate at what point the steps vary. 
Do the following to get your other device’s data migrated to your new Storm:
	
1.	Connect both the Windows Mobile device and BlackBerry Storm to 
your desktop computer.
	
2.	On your PC, choose Start➪All Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop 
Manager.
	
	 The Desktop Manager screen appears (refer to Figure 16-1, earlier in this 
chapter).
	
3.	Click the Device Switch Wizard icon.

276
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
	
4.	When Device Switch Wizard appears, click the image next to Switch 
from Another Device to BlackBerry Device.
	
	 The Welcome screen, shown in Figure 16-5, describes what the tool 
can do.
	
Figure 16-5: 
Migrating 
data from 
a non-
BlackBerry 
device.
	
	
5.	Click Next.
	
	 A screen prompts you to decide whether you’re migrating from Palm 
or Windows Mobile, as shown in Figure 16-6. The wizard is intelligent 
enough to enable the option associated with the connected device, 
which in this figure is a Windows Mobile device.
	
Figure 16-6: 
The wizard 
has already 
selected 
which 
device to 
port.
	
	
6.	Click Next.
	
	 Hot-syncing the Windows Mobile device kicks in at this point. You see a 
series of screens for each application’s data, such as Calendar, Contacts, 
and MemoPad. A sample of Calendar data is shown in Figure 16-7. The 
screen indicates what to sync and will be empty if you performed a hot-
sync before running the wizard. Otherwise, syncing will take some time, 
depending on how much data there is to sync between the device and 
the desktop software.

	 A progress screen appears. Before the data is applied to your Storm, the 
wizard prompts you about the change, as shown in Figure 16-8. Click the 
following buttons in this screen to either confirm or reject the change:
 
• Details: You want to know the records the wizard is trying to 
apply.
 
• Accept: You just want the data migrated.
 
• Reject: Ignore this data and continue.
 
• Cancel: Change your mind and cancel the whole operation.

I
magine that you left your beautiful BlackBerry Storm in the back of a 
cab. You’ve lost your Storm for good. Okay, not good. What happens to 
all your information? How are you going to replace all those contacts? What 
about security?
One thing that you don’t need to worry about is information security — if you 
set up a security password on your BlackBerry. With security password pro­
tection on your Storm, anyone who finds it has only ten chances to enter the 
correct password; after those ten chances are up, it’s self-destruction time. 
Although it isn’t as smoky as Mission Impossible, your BlackBerry Storm does 
erase all its information, thwarting your would-be data thief.
	
Set up a password for your Storm now! For information on how to do so, see 
Chapter 3.
Now, how to get back all the information that was on your BlackBerry Storm? 
If you’re like us and store important information on your BlackBerry, this 
chapter is for you. Vital information, such as clients’ and friends’ contact 

280
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
information, notes from phone calls with clients — and, of course, those pre­
cious e-mail messages — shouldn’t be taken lightly. Backing up this informa­
tion is a reliable way to protect it from being lost forever.
If you work for a large corporation, your BlackBerry is typically in a BlackBerry 
Enterprise Server. If that’s not the case for you, usually BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager is the only way to back up and restore information to and from your 
desktop PC. But in recent months, a software package called SmrtGuard has 
come up with a wireless backup and restore service for those who aren’t in 
the habit of plugging their BlackBerry into their PC. If that’s you, go to the end 
of this chapter, where we introduce SmrtGuard’s backup and restore solution, 
which will give you peace of mind when it comes to protecting your data.
Accessing Backup and Restore
Backup and Restore is a BlackBerry Desktop Manager application. It allows 
you to back up all the sensitive data on your BlackBerry, including contacts, 
e-mails, memos, to-dos, all personal preferences, and options.
Note: For most of you, e-mails are already stored in accounts such as Gmail 
or Yahoo! Mail. But some people still like to back up e-mails, just in case.
To get started with BlackBerry Desktop Manager:
	
1.	Install BlackBerry Desktop Manager on your PC.
	
	 For instructions on installing BlackBerry Desktop Manager, see 
Chapter 15.
	
2.	Connect your Storm to your PC with the USB cable that came with 
your BlackBerry.
	
	 If everything is set up right, a window appears on your PC, asking you to 
type your BlackBerry security password.
	
3.	Type your password.
	
	 The BlackBerry connects to the PC.
	
4.	Double-click the Backup and Restore icon on the BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager screen.
	
	 The Backup and Restore screen opens; see Figure 17-1. You’re ready to 
back up data from or restore information to your BlackBerry.

281

Backing Up BlackBerry Style
We all know that backing up your data provides tremendous peace of mind. 
So do the folks at RIM, which is why backing up your information is easy. You 
can back up your BlackBerry Storm manually or by autopilot.
Backing up your Storm manually
To back up your BlackBerry Storm on demand, follow these steps:
	
1.	Connect your Storm to your PC with the USB cable.
	
2.	From the BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen, double-click the 
Backup and Restore icon.
	
	 The Backup and Restore screen appears (refer to Figure 17-1, in the 
preceding section).
	
3.	Click the Backup button.
	
	 The dialog box shown in Figure 17-2 appears, so you can name the 
backup file and figure out where on your PC you want to save it.
	
4.	Name your backup file and choose a place to save it.

282
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
	
5.	Click Save.
	
	BlackBerry Desktop Manager starts backing up your BlackBerry infor­
mation onto your PC. Figure 17-3 shows the backup progress in the 
Transfer in Progress window.
	
	 Don’t unplug your BlackBerry Storm from the PC until the backup is 
finished! The folks at RIM have made the USB transfer fast, so you don’t 
have to wait that long!
	
6.	When the Transfer in Progress window disappears, you can unplug 
the BlackBerry from the PC.

 Chapter 17: Protecting Your Information
Setting up automatic backups
What’s better than backing up your information once? Remembering to back 
up regularly! What’s better than backing up regularly? You guessed it — 
running backups automatically. After you schedule automated BlackBerry 
backups, you can really have peace of mind when it comes to preventing 
information loss.
Follow these steps to set up an autobackup:
	
1.	From BlackBerry Desktop Manager, double-click the Backup and 
Restore icon.
	
	 The Backup and Restore screen appears.
	
2.	Click the Options button.
	
	 The Backup Options screen, where you can schedule automatic back­
ups, appears. See Figure 17-4.
	
Figure 17-4: 
Set 
autobackups 
here.
	
	
3.	Select the Back Up My Device Automatically Every option.
	
	 This lets you make more decisions (check boxes and options become 
active), such as how often you want BlackBerry Desktop Manager to 
back up your BlackBerry.
	
4.	In the Days field, enter a number of days between 1 and 99.
	
	 This interval sets how often your BlackBerry Storm is backed up. For 
example, if you enter 14, your Storm is backed up every 14 days.
	
5.	Select the Back Up All Device Application Data option.
	
	This option backs up all the data on your BlackBerry Storm each time 
autobackup runs.

284
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
	
	 Although you can exclude e-mail messages and information such as 
Contacts, to-do’s, and memos, we recommend that you back up every­
thing each time.
	
6.	Click OK.
	
	 Now you can get on with your life without worrying when to back up 
your Storm.
	
To run a backup, you must connect your BlackBerry Storm to your PC. Make 
sure that you plug your Storm into your PC once in a while so autobackup has 
a chance to back up your information.
Restoring Your Data from 
Backup Information
We hope that you never have to read this section more than once. A full 
restore brings back all your information from a backup. It probably means 
you’ve lost information that you had hoped to find from the backup you 
created on your PC.
The steps to fully restore your backup information are simple:
	
1.	Connect your Storm to your PC using the USB cable.
	
2.	From BlackBerry Desktop Manager, double-click the Backup and 
Restore icon.
	
	 The Backup and Restore screen appears.
	
3.	Click the Restore button.
	
	 An Open File dialog box asks where the backup file is on your PC.
	
4.	Choose a backup file and click Open.
	
	A warning window appears when you’re about to do a full restore 
(see Figure 17-5), alerting you that you’re about to overwrite existing 
information.
	
5.	Click Yes to go ahead with the full restore.
	
	 A progress bar appears.
	
	 It might take a while for the full restore to finish. Don’t unplug your 
BlackBerry Storm from your PC during this time!
	
6.	When the progress bar disappears, unplug the device from the PC.

Protecting Your Data Your Way
A certain burger joint and BlackBerry have in common that you can have it 
your way with their products. Just like you can get your burger with or with­
out all the extras (such as pickles and onions), you can choose to not back 
up and restore things that you know you won’t need.
Say you’ve accidentally deleted your Internet bookmarks, and now you want 
them back. Don’t restore all the information from your last backup. That 
could be more than 90 days ago (depending on how often your autobackup 
runs, if at all). You might unintentionally overwrite other information, such as 
e-mail or new contacts. You want to restore bookmarks only.
If you lose something in particular or want something specific back on your 
BlackBerry, use the selective backup and restore function in BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager and restore only what you need. The same goes with back­
ing up. If you’re a big e-mail user, back up just your e-mails and nothing else.
	
In this section, we use the term databases. Don’t worry; this isn’t as tech­
nical as you think. Think of a database as an information category on the 
BlackBerry. For example, saying “backing up your Browser bookmarks data­
base” is just a fancy way of saying “backing up all your Browser bookmarks on 
your BlackBerry.”
We start with a selective backup and then describe a selective restore.

286
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
Backing up your way
To back up specific information, follow these steps:
	
1.	Connect your Storm to your PC using the USB cable.
	
2.	From BlackBerry Desktop Manager, double-click the Backup and 
Restore icon.
	
	 The Backup and Restore screen appears.
	
3.	Click the Advanced button.
	
	 The advanced Backup and Restore screen appears, as shown in Figure 17-6. 
The right side of the screen shows different information categories, or 
databases.
	
Figure 17-6: 
The 
advanced 
Backup and 
Restore 
screen.
	
	
4.	In the right column, Ctrl+click the databases you want to back up.
	
5.	Click the left-pointing (backup) arrow.
	
	 A progress bar moves while your BlackBerry Storm is backed up. This 
step merely transfers the databases onto your PC; it doesn’t save them. 
When the backup transfer is finished, you can see the two databases on 
the left side of the window.
	
6.	Choose File➪Save As.
	
	A file chooser appears.
	
7.	Name your file and specify where you want to save it on your PC.
	
	 This saves your selective backup on your PC. Make sure to name it 
something specific so you know what exactly is in the backup.

287
 Chapter 17: Protecting Your Information
	
You need to manually save the backup file on your PC even after you choose a 
location for the file in Step 4. A selective backup doesn’t automatically save 
your backup on your PC.
Restoring your way
When restoring selectively, you must already have a backup file to restore 
from. Although this might sound obvious, the point we’re making is that you 
can selectively restore from any backup — auto or manual.
Say you have autobackup running every other day, and you want to restore 
only your e-mail messages from two days ago. You don’t need to do a full 
restore; that would overwrite the new contact you put in your Contacts yes­
terday. Rather, you can use the selective restore method and get back only 
your e-mail messages.
To restore your way, follow these steps:
	
1.	Connect your Storm to your PC using the USB cable.
	
2.	From BlackBerry Desktop Manager, double-click the Backup and 
Restore icon.
	
	 The Backup and Restore screen appears.
	
3.	Click the Advanced button.
	
	 The advanced Backup and Restore screen appears (refer to Figure 17-6, 
earlier in this chapter). The right side of the screen shows your different 
information categories, or databases.
Looking at backup BlackBerry files
Whether you use the one-button-push backup 
method or manually back up your file, the file is 
saved on your PC as an .ipd file. Those curi­
ous readers out there might be asking, “Can I 
read these backup files without a BlackBerry?” 
The answer is yes! With a third-party product 
called ABC Amber BlackBerry Converter, you 
can view any .ipd file. What’s the point? 
Suppose you lost your BlackBerry Storm but 
need to read an old e-mail or to get contacts 
from your backup files. This tool allows you to 
convert anything in your backup file (e-mails, 
SMS messages, PIM messages, and con­
tacts) to PDF or Microsoft Word documents. 
For more information and to try ABC Amber 
BlackBerry Converter for free, go to www.
processtext.com/abcblackberry.
html.
Because anyone with Amber BlackBerry 
Converter can look into your backups, make 
sure that you secure your backup files so only 
you can get to them.

288
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
	
4.	Choose File➪Open.
	
	 A window opens so you can choose which backup file you want to 
restore from.
	
	 A BlackBerry backup file has an .ipd extension.
	
5.	Select a backup file.
	
6.	Click the Open button.
	
	 The different information categories, or databases, appear on the left 
side of the screen. You’re ready for a selective restore.
	
7.	Select categories (or databases).
	
	 You can select multiple databases by Ctrl+clicking the databases you 
want.
	
8.	Click the right-facing (Restore) arrow.
	
	You’ll likely see a warning window asking whether you want to replace 
all the information with the data you’re restoring (refer to Figure 17-5, 
earlier in this chapter).
	
	 If your BlackBerry Storm has the same categories as the ones you’re 
restoring (which is likely), you’ll overwrite any information you have on 
your BlackBerry.
	
	 You can confidently move on to Step 9 if you know that the database 
you’re restoring has the information you’re looking for.
	
9.	Click OK.
	
	 A progress bar appears during the selective restore. When the progress 
bar window disappears, the information categories that you’ve selected 
are restored on your BlackBerry.
Clearing BlackBerry information your way
You can also delete information on your BlackBerry Storm from BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager. When would you use selective deletion?
Suppose that you want to clear only your phone logs from your BlackBerry. 
One way is to tediously select one phone log at a time and press Delete, 
repeating until all phone logs are gone. However, you could delete a data­
base from the advanced Backup and Restore screen by using the Backup and 
Restore function.
To selectively delete databases on your BlackBerry, follow these steps:
	
1.	Connect your Storm to your PC using the USB cable.

289
 Chapter 17: Protecting Your Information
	
2.	From BlackBerry Desktop Manager on your PC, double-click the 
Backup and Restore icon.
	
	 The Backup and Restore screen appears.
	
3.	Click the Advanced button.
	
	 The advanced Backup and Restore screen appears (refer to Figure 17-6, 
earlier in this chapter). The right side of the screen shows your 
BlackBerry’s different databases.
	
4.	Ctrl+click the database you want to delete.
	
	 The database is highlighted.
	
5.	 Click the Clear button on the right side of the screen.
	
	A warning window asks you to confirm your deletion.
	
6.	Click OK.
	
	A progress bar shows the deletion. When the progress bar disappears, 
the database (information category) you selected is cleared from your 
BlackBerry.
Backing Up and Restoring Wirelessly
Your BlackBerry Storm can back up and restore without being on BlackBerry 
Enterprise Server. To do so, you use a piece of software called SmrtGuard for 
BlackBerry (www.SmrtGuard.com) that sits in your Storm and can wirelessly 
back up your data. Currently, SmrtGuard supports address book contacts, 
memos, calendar, phone log, and to-dos, e-mail, and SMS messages; it plans 
to support pictures soon. SmrtGuard also supports the Android platform, so 
you can migrate your data from the Android phone to your BlackBerry Storm.
In addition to its backup and restore capabilities, SmrtGuard has features to 
help you locate, recover, or destroy device-side data. Its tracking, or Find 
My BlackBerry, feature helps you determine whether you misplaced the 
device or whether it was stolen. If the device was stolen, you can send 
a signal to have your data destroyed via the SmrtGuard Dashboard on 
www.SmrtGuard.com.

operating system. (Yup, that’s right — your Storm has an OS.)
This chapter starts by introducing BlackBerry App World, which you use to 
load applications (who’d have guessed?) onto your Storm. Next, we describe 
the Application Loader application on PC and the BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
on Mac, which you use to install and uninstall apps to and from your Storm. 
Then we explore how you can upgrade the OS of your smart phone.
	
In the Part of Tens, you’ll find a few great games that make your BlackBerry 
that much more fun.
Using BlackBerry App World
Your Storm comes with BlackBerry App World, an application store (or app 
store) that provides an organized listing of apps, both free and for purchase.

292
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
Navigating App World
What better way to describe BlackBerry App World than opening the app and 
navigating to the screen? To launch the store, simply touch-press BlackBerry 
App World from the Home screen. BlackBerry App World sports an icon simi­
lar to the one on the menu key but enclosed in a circle. After you launch App 
World, you see a progress screen momentarily, followed by a Featured Items 
screen similar to Figure 18-1.
	
Figure 18-1: 
BlackBerry 
App World, 
showcasing 
featured 
applications.
	
	
If you don’t have App World on your Storm, you can download it from the RIM 
Web site at http://na.blackberry.com/eng/services/appworld.
The bottom part of the screen in Figure 18-1 shows a few icons that you can 
use to quickly navigate the store. From left to right, they are as follows:
	
✓	Categories: Apps are organized and showcased in a series of categories. 
It’s easy to explore a certain type of app by going to this link.
	
✓	Top Free: Find it here first. If you’re lucky, the type of app you are look­
ing for is offered free of charge. This is the place to find the most popu­
lar free apps.
	
✓	Top Paid: Best-selling apps are listed here.
	
✓	Search: If you know the app you’re looking for, go here. The link allows 
you to enter the name and search for it from the store.
	
✓	My World: This lists the apps you’ve downloaded from the store.

293
 Chapter 18: Installing and Managing Third-Party Applications
	
If you are sitting at a desktop computer, you’ll be glad to know that RIM cre­
ated a Web version of App World. Using your desktop Internet browser, you 
can visit the site at http://appworld.blackberry.com/. The site allows 
you to send an e-mail to your device with a download link for the app you are 
interested in.
Installing an application using App World
Found a free-time killer game from the store? Installing the app is easy, and 
you probably see all the links on the screen. But here’s a quick rundown on 
how to do an installation anyway:
	
1.	Touch-press BlackBerry App World on the Home screen.
	
2.	Navigate to the application you want to install.
	
3.	Touch-press the application’s icon.
	
	You see a screen similar to Figure 18-2, which in this example shows a 
Download button for Google Talk.
	
4.	Touch-press the Download button.
	
	 The My World screen appears. At the top are the app you’re downloading 
and a progress bar, as shown in Figure 18-3. When the download has fin­
ished, the installation kicks in and is indicated with a progress screen, as 
shown in Figure 18-4. You’ll surely get a prompt after the app is installed.

Finding and Installing Applications 
from Other App Stores
BlackBerry App World is not the only app store out there in BlackBerry Land. 
You can also check out the following pioneers. Why do you need additional 
app stores? BlackBerry App World has a minimum price of $2.99 to be listed

 Chapter 18: Installing and Managing Third-Party Applications
as a non-free app, so this limits app developers who want to sell their apps 
for less.
	
✓	Handango (www.handango.com): Handango is one of the oldest store­
fronts that sell applications for mobile devices. They started selling apps 
through their Web site but eventually created an app store. Handango’s 
app store can be downloaded from their Web site.
	
✓	CrackBerry On-Device App Store (http://crackberryappstore.
com): Partnering with MobiHand, CrackBerry also provides an app store 
where you can find great applications to download.
	
✓	BlackBerry Application Center: This is software built by RIM, but the 
carrier has control over what shows up in Application Center. The app 
is typically already installed on your Storm, possibly under the brand 
name of your wireless carrier.
	
This might sound like a shameless plug, but it’s not. We’re just looking out 
for your best interests and your pocketbook! Although RIM’s BlackBerry App 
World launched in April 2009, CrackBerry has been offering apps via its app 
store since the site launched in February 2007. Following are some of the com­
pelling reasons why thousands of BlackBerry users visit CrackBerry.com’s 
App Store regularly in addition to App World:
	
✓	Web version available: Although on-device app stores are all the rage 
these days, CrackBerry also offers a computer-optimized version of their 
app store. This makes it easy to browse apps, view feature-rich info 
(video demos), and purchase multiple applications in one transaction 
versus just one at a time, as is the case with on-device clients.
	
✓	99-cent minimum pricing: Developers have the option to price their 
apps as low as 99 cents. Due to App World’s pricing restrictions, you 
can often find the same app that sells in App World for $2.99 for $1.99 or 
even 99 cents in the CrackBerry App Store.
	
✓	Deal of the Day and promotions: CrackBerry App Store offers a Deal of 
the Day, in which every day, one application for your device is on sale at 
a deep discount (often 50 percent off!). The CrackBerry App Store also 
gives developers the ability to promote their apps, via sales and coupon 
codes.
	
✓	Payment options: CrackBerry App Store accepts both credit cards and 
PayPal for payments.
	
✓	Support: In addition to technical support from developers, CrackBerry’s 
App Store features a dedicated support team if you run into order 
issues.
	
✓	Refunds: Unlike App World, the CrackBerry App Store offers refunds.
The list goes on! You can find out more and download the CrackBerry App 
Store client by visiting http://crackberry.com/appstore.

Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
Accessing Application Loader
In this chapter, you work closely with your Windows PC and your Storm. On 
your PC, you use BlackBerry Desktop Manager, which comes on a CD along 
with your Storm. You can find Application Loader in BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager.
	
For an introduction to BlackBerry Desktop Manager, see Chapter 15.
After installing BlackBerry Desktop Manager on your PC, do the following to 
access Application Loader:
	
1.	On your PC, choose Start➪All Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop 
Manager.
	
2.	Connect your Storm to your PC via USB cable.
	
	If the connection is successful, you see the password dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 18-5.
	
Figure 18-5: 
The 
password 
dialog box 
on your PC.
	
	
	 If the connection isn’t successful, see whether the USB cable is con­
nected properly to both your PC and your Storm and then try again. If 
all else fails, contact the technical support department of your service 
provider.
	
3.	Enter your password.
	
	Your Storm-to-PC connection is complete.
	
4.	On your PC, double-click the Application Loader icon in BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager.
	
	The Application Loader screen opens, as shown in Figure 18-6. At this 
point, you’re ready to use Application Loader.

Installing an Application
	
In this chapter, we show you how to install iSkoot for Skype for BlackBerry. 
iSkoot is a free application that connects to the Web directly and allows you to 
use Skype. You can download this application at
www.download.com/iSkoot-for-Skype-BlackBerry-/3000-7242_4-10797721.html
Installing, Windows Style
No matter what application you’re installing from your PC to your Storm, the 
steps are the same. Use the following steps as a guide to installing the appli­
cation of your choice:
	
1.	Download the application installation files to your PC.
	
	 Refer to the app publisher’s instructions on how to download the instal­
lation files. This is the only part of the installation process that varies 
from vendor to vendor. Some vendors allow you to download a ZIP file, 
and some vendors do the extra effort of giving you a self-extracting file. 
After following their instructions, you should end up with a set of files, 
and one of those files should have an .alx extension.
	
2.	Locate the application’s ALX file.
	
	 You can usually find a file with the .alx extension in the folder where 
you installed the application on your PC.

298
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
	
	 The ALX file doesn’t get installed on your Storm. It tells Application 
Loader where the actual application file is located on your PC.
	
3.	Double-click the Application Loader icon in BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager.
	
	The Application Loader screen appears (refer to Figure 18-6, in the pre­
ceding section).
	
4.	Use the USB cable to connect your Storm to your PC.
	
	A screen appears, prompting you to enter your Storm password.
	
5.	Enter your password (refer to Figure 18-5, in the preceding section).
	
	 After you enter your password, the Application Loader screen indicates 
that your device is connected.
	
6.	Click the Start button, below Add/Remove Applications.
	
	 The screen lists the applications you can install.
	
7.	Click the Browse button, and locate and select the ALX file you want 
to install.
	
	 You return to the Application Loader screen, where iSkoot is one of the 
applications in the list, as shown in Figure 18-7.
	
Figure 18-7: 
Your 
application 
is added 
to the list 
of installed 
applications 
and can be 
installed on 
your Storm.
	
	
8.	Select the application you want to install (for this example, select 
iSkoot Skype for BlackBerry) and then click Next.
	
	 A summary screen appears, listing only the applications that will be 
installed or upgraded.

299
 Chapter 18: Installing and Managing Third-Party Applications
	
9.	Click Finish.
	
	 The installation process starts, and a progress window appears. When 
the progress window disappears — and if all went well — the applica­
tion is in the Applications folder of your Storm.
If you get an invalid signature error after clicking the Finish button, the solu­
tion depends on how you received your Storm:
	
✓	If you didn’t get your Storm from your employer, something is prob­
ably wrong with the application. You need to contact the software 
vendor.
	
✓	If you got your Storm from your employer, you don’t have permis­
sion to install applications on your Storm. The IT department rules the 
school.
	
You don’t have to use Application Loader to get the goods onto your Storm, 
though. You can install applications in other ways as well:
	
✓	Wirelessly, through an over-the-air (OTA) download: See the section 
on installing and uninstalling applications from the Web in Chapter 10 
for more on wireless installations.
	
✓	BlackBerry Enterprise Server wireless install (if your Storm was pro­
vided by your employer): In this case, you have no control over the 
installation process. Your company’s BlackBerry system administrator 
controls which applications are on your Storm.
	
✓	Through the PC using Microsoft Installer: Some application installations 
automate the preceding steps. All you need to do is connect your Storm 
to the PC and then double-click the installation file. The application instal­
lation’s file using Microsoft Installer bears the .msi file extension.
Installing, Mac Style
For Mac users, a newly minted BlackBerry Desktop Manager allows you to 
add applications to and remove applications from your Storm.
To install an app, follow these steps
	
1.	Connect the Storm to your Mac.
	
2.	On your Mac, click BlackBerry Desktop Manager on the Dock.
	
	 Can’t find the BlackBerry Desktop Manager icon? Use the Finder, which 
is located at the left end of the Dock.

300
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
	
	 If you haven’t installed BlackBerry Desktop Manager, Google BlackBerry 
Mac. The first entry on the search results page should take you to the 
download page.
	
3.	In the BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen, click the Applications 
icon.
	
	 The next screen (see Figure 18-8) lists applications installed on your 
Storm as well as those available for installation. Your next step is to add 
the ALX file for the application you want to install.
	
Figure 18-8: 
Install or 
uninstall 
applications 
here.
	
	
4.	Click the + button (on the bottom left), and locate and select the ALX 
file you want to install.
	
	 You return to the Install/Remove Applications screen (refer to Figure 18-8), 
where iSkoot is one of the applications in the list.
	
5.	In the Install column, select the application(s) you want to install.
	
	 For an installed app, deselecting it from the list will uninstall the app. 
Keep it selected if you want to keep the app on your Storm.
	
6.	Click the Start button.
	
	 BlackBerry Desktop Manager starts installing your selected apps. This 
may take time, depending on the sizes of these apps.

301
 Chapter 18: Installing and Managing Third-Party Applications
Uninstalling an Application
You can uninstall an application in three ways:
	
✓	Using Application Loader under Windows PC
	
✓	Using BlackBerry Desktop Manager on the Mac
	
✓	Using your Storm
We use iSkoot as an example here and assume that you’ve already installed 
the iSkoot application. You can follow the same steps for uninstalling other 
applications.
Uninstalling with Application 
Loader under Windows PC
To uninstall a BlackBerry application using Application Loader on your PC, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	On your PC, double-click the Application Loader icon in BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager.
	
2.	Use the USB cable to connect the Storm to the PC.
	
	A screen prompts you to enter your Storm password.
	
3.	Enter your password.
	
	 If your handheld isn’t connected properly, the PIN of your device won’t 
appear in the Application Loader screen. Connect your Storm to the USB 
cable and then connect the USB cable to the PC.
	
	 After you enter your password, the Application Loader screen indicates 
that your device is connected.
	
4.	Click the Start button, below Add/Remove Applications.
	
	 A screen appears listing applications (similar to Figure 18-7, earlier in 
this chapter).
	
5.	Scroll to the application you want to delete and then deselect its 
check box.
	
	 For example, when we deselect the iSkoot Skype for BlackBerry check 
box, the Action column for iSkoot indicates Remove.

302
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
	
6.	Click Next.
	
	 You see a summary screen that lists the action of Application Loader. It 
indicates that iSkoot is to be removed from your Storm.
	
7.	Click Finish.
	
	The uninstall process starts, and a progress window appears. When the 
progress window disappears, you have uninstalled the application from 
your Storm.
Uninstalling with BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager on the Mac
The steps for uninstalling an app using the BlackBerry Desktop Manager on 
the Mac should be familiar to you because they use the same screen as the 
one for installing an app. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Connect the Storm to the Mac.
	
2.	On the Mac, click BlackBerry Desktop Manager on the Dock.
	
3.	In the BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen, click the Applications icon.
	
4.	Deselect the application(s) in the list that you want to uninstall.
	
5.	Click the Start button.
	
	 BlackBerry Desktop Manager starts uninstalling the selected apps.
Uninstalling with the Storm
When you don’t have access to your PC, you can uninstall an application 
directly from your Storm. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Locate the application icon on the BlackBerry Home screen.
	
	 By default, any applications you installed on your Storm are filed in the 
Downloads folder on the Home screen. However, you always have the 
option to move the application to other folders or to the Home screen.
	
2.	Tap the application icon, press the menu key, and touch-press Delete.
	
3.	In the confirmation dialog box that appears, touch-press Delete to con­
firm the deletion.
	
	 You’re given a choice to restart now or at a later time. After the restart, 
the deleted application is uninstalled.

303
 Chapter 18: Installing and Managing Third-Party Applications
Upgrading the BlackBerry Storm OS
The OS used by Storm has gone through a few revisions. The BlackBerry OS 
update comes from BlackBerry Handheld Software, which is available from 
three sources:
	
✓	Your network service provider
	
✓	The Research In Motion Web site
	
✓	Your BlackBerry system administrator
	
Because the handheld software might differ from provider to provider, we rec­
ommend getting it from the service provider’s Web site. RIM has a download 
site for different service providers at
http://na.blackberry.com/eng/support/downloads/download_sites.jsp
In this section, we assume that the latest BlackBerry Handheld Software for 
Storm is already installed on your PC. For help with installing BlackBerry 
Handheld Software, refer to the instructions that come with it.
	
If you plan to upgrade your BlackBerry OS, and you’ve installed many third-
party applications, check whether those applications support the new OS revi­
sion. Third-party applications work as is most of the time, but there is always 
a possibility of losing third-party application data.
	
You may think that the latest operating system, or firmware, for your device 
is what is approved by your carrier and available via the blackberry.com 
Web site. However, often a newer version is “unofficially” available. Research 
In Motion continuously works on the operating system for each device model 
they sell, turning out a new build each week. Occasionally, these internal 
builds — which are stepping stones along the way to the next official release 
and may not see carrier approval — leak onto the Internet. Typically, the 
newer the firmware version, the better, and a cult following of BlackBerry 
owners feverishly anticipate the next leaked build. To stay on top of the 
latest official and unofficial BlackBerry OS releases, visit crackberry.com 
and click the BlackBerry OS category under Articles, or visit the OS and OS 
Beta forums in the CrackBerry forums.
Upgrading the Storm OS, Windows Style
If you are a Windows user, you can start the upgrade process by doing the 
following:

304
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
	
1.	Enter your Storm password (if you have set one) into BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager on your PC.
	
2.	Double-click the Application Loader icon on the Desktop Manager screen.
	
	The Application Loader screen appears (refer to Figure 18-6, earlier in 
this chapter).
	
3.	Click the Start button below Add/Remove Applications.
	
	 A list of software appears, as shown in Figure 18-9.
	
Figure 18-9: 
Application 
updates 
that are 
available.
	
	
4.	With your mouse, you can opt out of the upgrade by deselecting the 
OS portion.
	
	 The OS appears as BlackBerry 5.0 System Software in Figure 18-9.
	
	The OS is listed only if you need an upgrade — meaning that your 
BlackBerry OS is out of date. If the OS doesn’t appear in the list, the 
handheld software you installed on the desktop machine is the same as 
the one installed on your device or a previous version compared with 
the one installed on your device.
	
	 You also need to back up your device in case something goes wrong 
with the upgrade. Backup options can be accessed through the Options 
button.

305
 Chapter 18: Installing and Managing Third-Party Applications
	
5.	Click Options.
	
	 The Options screen appears, as shown in Figure 18-10. This is where you 
decide whether you want to back up your Storm content before upgrad­
ing your OS. We suggest that you do so.
	
Figure 18-10: 
Choose 
whether 
to back 
up before 
upgrading.
	
	
6.	Select the Back Up Device Data Automatically During the Installation 
Process check box and then click OK.
	
	 You return to the screen shown in Figure 18-8, earlier in this chapter.
	
7.	Click Next.
	
	A summary page confirms your actions — a final chance for you to pro­
ceed with the OS upgrade or not.
	
8.	Click Finish.
	
	 The BlackBerry OS upgrade starts, complete with a progress window 
that shows a series of steps and a progress bar. The entire process takes 
about ten minutes, depending on your PC model and the OS version 
you’re upgrading to.
	
	 At times during the BlackBerry OS upgrade, your Storm’s display goes 
on and off. Don’t worry; this is normal.
	
	 When the progress window disappears, the OS upgrade is complete.
Upgrading the Storm OS, Mac Style
Upgrading your Storm OS from your Mac is no different from installing an 
app. Here’s how:

306
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
	
1.	Connect the Storm to your Mac.
	
2.	On your Mac, click BlackBerry Desktop Manager on the Dock.
	
3.	In the BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen, click the Applications icon.
	
4.	Click the Check for Updates button (bottom left in Figure 18-8, earlier 
in this chapter).
	
	 BlackBerry Desktop Manager checks online for any new versions of the 
OS for your Storm. If it finds one, it downloads that update and lists it on 
the Applications screen (refer to Figure 18-8).
	
5.	Click to select the check box next to the OS in the list (BBM 5.0 in 
Figure 18-8).
	
6.	Click the Start button to start the upgrade.

T
he BlackBerry retail box contains a few essentials: a battery, a charger, a 
micro USB cable, a belt clip, and a microSD card. If you’re like most of us, 
though, you’re not satisfied with what is included in the box. In this chapter, 
you find accessories that supplement your Storm2 — and where to get them.
	
Check out our companion Web site, www.blackberryfordummies.com, for 
an updated accessories list.
	
If you like to accessorize your Storm2, check out site promotions. Every now 
and then, a site such as www.crackberry.com runs a promotion and gives 
a big discount. Also look at RIM’s Web site at www.shopblackberry.com. 
They usually offer accessory bundles.
Unify AV Solution
Unify AV Solution is an innovative product of Unify4Life that makes smart 
phones (including your BlackBerry) a universal remote control. You can find 
a suite of features on the Unify4Life Web site, but a sample includes complete 
TV listings in your BlackBerry for informative channel switching. You can 
purchase it directly from http://unify4life.com/products.html.

310
Part V: The Part of Tens 
microSD Card
Your new BlackBerry normally comes with external memory: a microSD card. 
But if you’re not satisfied with its capacity, go hunt for a much bigger one. 
After all, you want to carry with you a boatload of music and video files, 
right? Many electronic gadgets use microSD cards, so they’re easy to find.
A normal price range at this writing is $45 for 16GB capacity and $85 for 32GB 
capacity. Special promotions come and go, but you can always find a good 
deal somewhere on the Internet. For any Internet purchase, take into consid­
eration the shipping and handling costs plus the vendor’s return policy (or 
lack thereof).
	
Any brand will do, as long as you make sure that you’re buying a microSD card.
Full Keyboards
As netbooks become more popular, people forget that the BlackBerry they 
already carry is a mininetbook. Internet? Check! E-mail? Check! Microsoft 
Word docs and Microsoft Excel spreadsheets? Check! Sure, the screen is a 
bit smaller and the keyboard is small, but with a little help from a Bluetooth 
keyboard, your BlackBerry will save you the cost of a netbook and still do the 
things a netbook can do.
	
You have the choice of Bluetooth and non-Bluetooth connection options. 
We recommend Bluetooth to minimize the clutter. A Bluetooth keyboard is 
the most convenient option for the obvious reasons: You don’t have to carry 
cables, and you can position your BlackBerry any way you want.
For less than $100, you can own the cool iGo Stowaway Ultra-Slim Bluetooth 
keyboard, available at www.amazon.com. Or you can buy the ThinkOutside 
Stowaway Shasta Bluetooth keyboard for BlackBerry, available at http://
yahooshopping.com for $45. We also recommend the Freedom Universal 
Bluetooth keyboard, which you can find under Bluetooth keyboards at 
http://shop.crackberry.com or Amazon.com.
Stereo Headsets
Although your new BlackBerry is a stereo music player, it doesn’t come with 
stereo headphones. You will definitely yearn for stereo sound the moment 
you listen to music or watch video clips. A quick search on the Internet for 
BlackBerry + stereo headphones yields many results. But you want to be able 
to talk, too.

311
 Chapter 19: Ten Great Storm Accessories
You could spend $30 to $200. Several good headsets follow:
	
✓	BlackBerry stereo headset with noise-isolating ear gels
	
✓	V-MODA Vibe duo in-ear headphones with mic
	
✓	Motorola S9 stereo Bluetooth headset
	
The best place to get stereo headphones for your BlackBerry is good ol’ 
Amazon: www.amazon.com.
Case and Belt Clip
You have plenty of cases to choose among, with looks ranging from sporty to 
professional. These cases can set you back anywhere from $20 to $40, which 
isn’t too bad for looking hip. Here’s where you can buy a new case or belt 
clip:
	
✓	http://shop.crackberry.com
	
✓	www.amazon.com
	
✓	www.bberry.com
	
✓	www.blackberryden.com
	
✓	www.blackberrysource.com
	
When you buy a new belt case or clip, buy one made specifically for your 
BlackBerry Storm2. Also, it’s important that the case or clip come with a small 
magnet. BlackBerry is holster-aware and conserves battery juice, and this 
magnet is the key for the BlackBerry to know that it is inside a holster.
Screen Protector and Skins
If the protector case described in the preceding section is a bit stressful for 
your wallet, try the Blackberry Pro high-definition screen protector with 
mirror effect. That’s a mouthful, but for about $10, it protects your screen 
from scratches. Go to www.accessorygeeks.com.
Other popular best sellers are skin cases. They come in many colors and 
keep your BlackBerry looking new. The price is usually between $9 and $12. 
Go to http://shop.crackberry.com or www.accessorygeeks.com.

312
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Extra Battery, Charger, 
and Charging Pod
An extra battery for your BlackBerry will come in handy if you’re a daily user. 
You’ll spend around $50 for the extra battery.
	
Buy your battery only from Research In Motion, at www.shopblackberry.
com, or an authorized RIM reseller, not from some unknown vendor. A faulty 
battery can damage your BlackBerry beyond repair.
	
Make sure that the battery you buy is for your BlackBerry model.
If you watch video on your BlackBerry, you know that the battery needs to be 
charged every few hours. And if you’re always on the go, you’d better have 
a portable charger on hand. The charger included with your BlackBerry is 
great to carry around town (and the world) because it has multiple adapters 
for different countries’ electric plugs.
If you’re a road warrior, get the BlackBerry car charger. It will set you back 
around $30. To top it off, you can also get a power station or charging pod, 
which connects to a power supply for charging and at the same time holds 
your BlackBerry firmly in place on your desk or nightstand. On your night­
stand, you can take advantage of sleep mode, which sets the device to not 
disturb you by doing things such as dimming the light and turning off the 
LED. The charging pod costs $12 to $30, depending on how fancy it is.
	
Make sure that the charger and the charging pod you buy are for the Storm.
You can get a BlackBerry car charger and charging pod from the following sites:
	
✓	http://shop.crackberry.com
	
✓	www.amazon.com
	
✓	www.blackberrysource.com
	
✓	www.shopblackberry.com (RIM’s official store)
External Speaker
BlackBerry comes with a speaker, but if the sound quality just isn’t good 
enough for your listening taste, an external Bluetooth speaker can bring your 
outdoor listening to the next level. We recommend the following:
	
✓	Blueant M1 Bluetooth stereo speakers
	
✓	Motorola EQ5 wireless travel stereo speaker

313
 Chapter 19: Ten Great Storm Accessories
For about $110, you can get either of them from http://shop.crack
berry.com.
Bluetooth Music Gateway
If you already have a great set of speakers or an audio entertainment system, 
using a RIM Bluetooth Music Gateway is the perfect way to stream music to 
your existing system. Simply pair your BlackBerry with the Bluetooth Music 
Gateway via Bluetooth (hence the name), and you are ready to go. What is 
even better is that this hockey puck–like Music Gateway can be paired with 
your PC or Mac, so you get more use out of it. Find it at http://shop.
crackberry.com.
Car Mount
To complete your BlackBerry car experience, mount your BlackBerry in your 
car. The market offers many products, ranging from $15 to $30. You can 
search the Web. You can also get a car mount from these BlackBerry sites:
	
✓	http://shop.crackberry.com
	
✓	www.amazon.com
	
✓	www.blackberrysource.com
	
Make sure that the product you’re choosing supports your BlackBerry model.
The latest wireless speakerphone from RIM is BlackBerry Visor Mount 
SpeakerPhone VM-605. It’s a Bluetooth speakerphone that you attach to your 
car’s visor, just like you attach your garage door opener. You can get one for 
$99 at www.shopblackberry.com.

ho says BlackBerry is all work and no play? True, you can get tons 
accomplished on your Storm, but what you do doesn’t necessarily 
have to be related to work. A few games come with your Storm, but you can 
beat those games only so many times before you get bored.
BlackBerry is a popular smart phone, and numerous BlackBerry game com­
panies are making more and more fun titles. For example, you can play a few 
holes on the Pebble Beach golf course or a game of online Texas Hold ’Em 
with other BlackBerry users. You can find a huge selection of games. What’s 
even better is that some great games are free.
After this chapter, you might play so many games on your Storm that you’ll have 
to watch your productivity level. Please check our companion Web site — www.
blackberryfordummies.com — for an updated list.
The games we list here are available at BlackBerry App World and 
CrackBerry App Store. If you need to download and install them, just point

2008 BlackBerry Developer Challenge. A lot of brainpower has been put into 
this mind-twisting game. For $4.99, you can download Nintaii. Just look for it 
in BlackBerry App World or CrackBerry App Store.

eb surfing with a BlackBerry has improved dramatically with the 
newer models. With higher screen resolution and bigger real estate, 
your BlackBerry Storm should give you one good mobile Web-browsing 
experience. And with a 3G connection, your Web browsing should be faster. 
Remember that by using Page view on your BlackBerry, where the Web page 
displays like it does in your PC Web browser, you can maintain the browsing 
habits you have on your PC, but in a smaller package.
The Web site recommendations in this chapter are based on reviews in the 
public domain and sites that help when you’re on the go.
Weather
You can keep up with weather changes at these sites:
	
✓	AccuWeather.com (www.accuweather.com): AccuWeather.com pro­
vides the local weather forecast.
	
✓	Weather.com (www.weather.com): Weather.com is smart enough to 
know that you’re using a mobile device and displays a nice, trim version 
of its page with a few links to non-weather–related information.

320
Part V: The Part of Tens 
If these two sites aren’t enough, check out the “Search Engines, Directories, 
and Portals” section, later in this chapter. Major portals have weather infor­
mation as well as traffic alerts and airport delays.
News
Most major news companies have mobile versions of their sites. This section 
gives you a sampling of what’s out there. We list the same Web address you’d 
expect when browsing from your desktop. These sites detect that you’re 
using a smart phone and redirect you to the mobile-friendly version of their 
sites:
	
✓	ABC News (www.abcnews.com): Get ABC News on your BlackBerry.
	
✓	BBC News (www.bbc.com): Read the BBC News right from your 
BlackBerry, even if you’re not in the United Kingdom.
	
✓	CNN (www.cnn.com): This is CNN’s mobile-friendly Web site.
	
✓	Reuters (www.reuters.com): This is a mobile-friendly version of the 
Reuters site.
	
✓	The New York Times (www.nytimes.com): This automatically points 
you to The New York Times mobile-friendly Web site, a site that’s clean 
and easy to navigate, without a lot of advertisements.
	
✓	USA Today (http://usatoday.com): USA Today, one of the most pop­
ular newspapers, is now available for free from your BlackBerry.
	
✓	Wired News (http://mobile.wired.com): Wired News is the mobile 
version of this tech-news Web site.
Search Engines, Directories, and Portals
In this section we list Web portals, which are sites that contain various infor­
mation or links to other sites:
	
✓	Google (www.google.com): The king of search engines works like a 
charm on your BlackBerry.
	
✓	MSN (www.msn.com): You can access MSN Hotmail, MSN Messenger, 
and an online calendar. MSN has all the features that you can find in a

to-the-minute stock quotes.

321
 Chapter 21: Ten Important Types of Web Sites
	
✓	RIM mobile home page (http://mobile.blackberry.com): This is 
the default home page setting for most BlackBerry browsers. The ser­
vice provider can customize it, though, so your BlackBerry browser may 
point to your service provider’s home page. RIM’s home page is defi­
nitely a place to start browsing the Web.
	
	You should definitely bookmark this site.
	
✓	Yahoo! Mobile (www.yahoo.com): Yahoo! is a smart portal because it 
knows you’re using a mobile device and formats the page accordingly — 
meaning a smaller page with no advertisements. The portal site allows 
BlackBerry users to employ regular Yahoo! functions, such as Yahoo! Mail, 
Messenger, Finance, and Games, as well as driving directions and weather.
	
	This is another site you should bookmark.
Business

BlackBerry. Visit the following sites for finance-related articles and news:
	
✓	BusinessWeek Online (www.businessweek.com): This is a place to get 
great finance information.
	
✓	Fidelity (www.fidelity.com): Fidelity is an online investment broker­
age firm.
	
✓	Yahoo! Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com): This is a great site for 
checking the performance of your stocks.
Travel
Every site in the following list of BlackBerry-accessible travel sites features 
flight status and gate numbers. Some allow you to log in (if you’re part of the 
airline’s frequent-flier program) to access frequent-flier benefits:
	
✓	Air Canada: www.aircanada.ca
	
✓	American Airlines: http://aa.flightlookup.com/omnisky
