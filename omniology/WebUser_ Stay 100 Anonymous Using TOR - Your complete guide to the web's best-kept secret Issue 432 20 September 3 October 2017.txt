e’ve all been there – you
check the price of a train
ticket only to go back the
next day and ﬁnd it’s shot up. A new
tool from ticket-booking company
Trainline provides a solution to this
problem by letting you predict how
much the cost of your journey will rise.
By analysing price trends from
billions of customer searches,
the Price Prediction feature not only
tells you the price of your Advance
ticket now, but how it is likely to
increase in the future.
If you’re organising travel well in
advance, the Trainline app lets you
know how long you have to decide
before the price rises. Train tickets
tend to be released 12 weeks before
the travel date, and become more
expensive as that date approaches.
For example, Trainline says a
standard-class Advance single fare
from London Euston to Manchester
maps.google.co.uk
If you find yourself driving around in circles looking for a
parking spot in London or Manchester, Google Maps can
help. The mobile app now uses historical data to show you
how difficult it is to park in certain spots in those cities. The
service, which has been
available in the US for several
months, has now expanded to
European locations including
the tourist hotspots of Paris,
Prague, Alicante, Malaga, Rome
and Milan, as well as cities in
Brazil and Canada.
The idea is that you can use
it to find less crowded areas
and better plan your journey.
Simply request directions to a
destination and tap the ‘parking
difficulty’ icon to see whether
parking is easy, medium or
limited. In the US, you can also
view nearby car parks (or
‘parking lots’) – a feature we
assume will come to the UK in
the near future.
bit.ly/amazon432
For most of us, online shopping
feels as natural as popping to
the high street but many people
are understandably reluctant to
hand over their credit and debit
card details on the internet. In
some cases, there is actually no
information to pass on since
about 1.5 million adults in the
UK don’t have a bank account.
Amazon is now ensuring that
everyone can make a purchase with its
service called Top Up. This lets you visit
a retailer offering PayPoint, scan a
barcode and deposit cash.
The barcodes are generated through
Amazon’s website or mobile app (look
under Gift Cards & Registry in the menu).
You can add between £5 and £250, and
get £5 promotional credit if you top up
£20 or more. Since the top-ups have
an expiry period of 10 years, you don’t
have to worry about spending the cash
too quickly or all at once.
Piccadilly costs £32 at 80 days
before the day of travel. This rises to
£38 at 41 days before, £42 at 13 days
before, £87 at two days before and
£126 on the day of travel itself, which
means you could potentially save £94
if you buy your ticket early enough.
Price Prediction is expected to
become increasingly accurate as
more people use it, although you
should bear in mind that Trainline
charges its own booking fees.

Need to Know
8 20 Sept - 3 Oct 2017
What happened?
Following leaks to the press by
a “disgruntled employee”, Apple
announced its latest iPhones at a highly
anticipated launch event. Much of the
attention focused on the price of the
iPhone X (or 10) which, at $1,000, makes
it Apple’s most expensive phone yet.
While UK pricing had yet to be
confirmed as we went to press, it’s
believed it could cost as much as £1,000.
As well as the iPhone X, which marks
10 years of the company’s
groundbreaking phone; Apple is set to
release the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus,
along with an updated operating
system, iOS 11. Rumours have been rife
and suggest that the phones will be all
glass, feature updated cameras and
have 3D facial recognition for security
and for creating animated emoji. The
iPhone X will feature a 5.8in OLED
display, have 3GB of memory and is
expected to come in three capacities:
64GB, 256GB and 512GB.
One major change rumoured earlier
this year had the TouchID fingerprint
scanner moving to the back of the
device or being integrated into the
edge-to-edge display. However, more
recent rumours suggest that Apple has
decided to scrap TouchID altogether
and will instead only permit facial
recognition as a means of unlocking the
device and for using security features
such as Apple Pay. The iPhone 8 is likely
to lack some top-end features, and may
therefore be more reasonably priced,
comparable to handsets already on sale.
Although the $1,000 price is seen as a
milestone or psychological barrier by
many people, previous versions of the
iPhone that included extra storage have
actually exceeded that mark. Apple may
also have some offers that make the
iPhone X’s price more palatable,
including bundling free subscriptions
to its Music and iCloud services.
How will it affect me?
The rising cost of iPhones isn’t driving
up prices across the rest of the market
and you can still find a reasonably
priced Android phone, so don’t panic
about being forced to spend a grand
on your next handset.
If you’re salivating at the prospect of
the iPhone 8 or iPhone X – and they’re
bound to look fantastic – you’ll probably
have to wait until the end of September
to pick one up. If you want to keep using
an iPhone but are put off by the price of
the new models, Apple is likely to
reduce the cost of its existing handsets,
so you’ll still be able to find a slightly
cheaper option.
Nor will you have to wait long for the
new features to filter through to other
handsets. Apple’s innovations are
frequently imitated by other phone
manufacturers. That said, copying ideas
goes both ways: the iPhone’s new
edge-to-edge display can already be
found on Samsung’s Android phones.
What do we think?
If you want the best, you have to pay for
it, but it’s hard to imagine that the
millions of consumers buying these
$1,000 handsets really need or even
want the gadgetry inside. How much
extra would you pay for facial
recognition? Or animated emoji? What
price for an entirely glass phone?
These features are intriguing and the
technology behind them highlights
Apple’s ability to cram anything and
everything into a phone. But none of the
additions are what we really, really want.
A 2016 survey by YouGov revealed that
half of users want a longer battery life,
a fifth want a shatterproof screen and
a sixth crave a water-resistant handset.
Instead, we get a thinner, more
breakable phone – that costs more.
Yet millions of us will buy the new
iPhone, most often on contract to avoid
paying the full price upfront. While
surveys may suggest that people want
sensible improvements to their handsets,
it’s also clear that many of us will buy
the new iPhone regardless of the price
or the usefulness of its new features.
Hopefully, we’ll have enough money left
over to buy a glass-protecting case and
an extra battery pack.
As we write, Apple has yet to make its
official announcement about all its new
products, so we’ll take a closer look at
them in next issue’s FAQ.

Need to Know
What happened?
Google has confirmed
plans to shut down the
Desktop version of Drive,
giving users of the cloud-
storage service until March
to switch to its successor,
Backup and Sync.
Google first announced
back in July that it was
working on a new way for
its users to back up and
sync their files in the cloud.
Backup and Sync is
designed to replace the
Google Photos Desktop
uploader and the Drive app
for Windows and MacOS.
Instead of separate apps
that require you to actively
upload files, Backup and
Sync will keep any folder
you choose synchronised
across devices and
available in the cloud.
How will it affect you?
Google will stop
supporting the Drive app
on 11 December, and the
app will stop working
entirely on 12 March. These
deadlines only apply to the
Desktop Drive app, not the
web-based Drive service,
which is continuing as
usual.
If you’re ready to make
Google Drive Desktop
to close next year
the switch, you can
download Backup and
Sync now (bit.ly/
backup432) rather than
waiting until March. When
you install it, pay attention
to which folders you’re
asking Google to back up
to the cloud, so you don’t
accidentally put something
on its servers that you’d
rather Google didn’t have
access to.
What do we think?
Google Backup and Sync
has all the benefits of the
Google Drive app, but is
simpler to use – and that’s
a definite bonus. It’s easy
to fall behind on backups,
and offering an automated
service for free should help
us all protect our most
precious files.
That said, there’s little
doubt Google would like us
to use up our free storage
quota so we have to pay
for more space. If you’re
considering upgrading to
paid-for storage, it’s worth
first looking at other
providers to see if they
offer you a better deal.
See our Weekend Project
on page 58 for advice
about switching service.
What happened?
The Facebook-owned
messaging app WhatsApp
doesn’t charge its billion
users, but it’s about to start
making some people pay,
with a new version that lets
businesses contact
customers.
Full details of the plan
haven’t yet been confirmed
because WhatsApp is still
building and testing the
new business tools, but it’s
believed that the
WhatsApp Business app
will be free for smaller
companies, while larger
corporations will have to
pay. As part of the plan,
WhatsApp business
accounts will get a verified
badge next to their
numbers, so recipients are
reassured that they are
being messaged by an
authentic company and not
a spammer or scammer.
How will it affect you?
The standard version of
WhatsApp will still be
available for individual
users for the foreseeable
future, so don’t panic:
you’re not being asked to
cough up to use the
messaging app. However,
the plan for the new
business version does
mean that once these tools
have been tested and
tweaked, companies will be
able to use WhatsApp to
contact you. Under law,
companies can’t contact
you unless you’ve agreed
first, as with email
marketing messages.
Of course, many
companies already use
WhatsApp to keep in touch
WhatsApp launches
paid-for version
with customers. You may
have a hairdresser who
accepts bookings via the
messaging app, or an
airline that sends flight
updates via text message.
This app will extend that
functionality.
What do we think?
These companies need to
find a way to make money,
and charging businesses
for extra tools is certainly
one way of building
a revenue stream. It’s
actually quite refreshing
that WhatsApp isn’t
targeting non-commercial
users. However, it’s hard
not to be concerned at
the idea of receiving
spam-like messages in
WhatsApp. Email inboxes
are widely considered to
be drowning in useless
messages, so much so
that some companies
are ditching it as a
communication tool. Let’s
hope WhatsApp doesn’t
fall into the same trap.

Sony LF-S50G
bit.ly/sony432
Every tech manufacturer seems to be
releasing a smart speaker this year,
and the latest is Sony’s LF-S50G
Bluetooth speaker.
Announced at the
IFA 2017 trade show
in Berlin, this compact
and stylish Google
Assistant-enabled
device will cost £200
when it’s released
in November.
The device echoes the
design of Apple’s own
Siri-powered HomePod
smart speaker: it’s
cylindrical in shape,
measuring little more
than 162mm in height,
adjust the volume, while swiping your
palm over the top changes the audio
track you’re listening to.
Sony has also gone all-out with
audio quality. The LF-S50G uses a
two-stage diffuser to spread sound
evenly throughout a room and this is
enhanced by the use of a “two-way
facing” speaker, designed to improve
sound coverage.
As smart speakers go, the £200
asking price is a little high, but that’s
acceptable if the sound quality
and features are a notch above
its rivals.
It’s clear that the Sony LF-S50G
offers a viable alternative to both
Google Home and Amazon Echo and,
despite stiff competition from
Panasonic’s new connected speaker
and Apple’s HomePod, it should be
more than capable of holding its own.
What happened?
Smart speakers from some of the
industry’s leading companies have been
found to be vulnerable to an exploit that
allows hackers to take control of them
by issuing silent commands.
Researchers at Zhejian University in
China recently discovered a technique
known as ‘DolphinAttack’, which
involves modifying the sounds of an
individual’s voice so they are inaudible
to human ears, but still capable of
issuing commands to voice assistants
such as Siri, Cortana and Alexa.
The microphones built into some of
the most popular home speakers,
including the Amazon Echo and Google
Home, and common consumer devices
such as tablets and laptops, are able to
pick up these inaudible commands and
perform tasks seemingly at random.
Specifically, researchers were able to
send commands using ultrasonic
frequencies in a range above 20,000Hz,
something that a human can’t possibly
recreate vocally or listen out for.
In lab tests at the university, the trick
worked with smart assistants developed
by Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft,
and Huawei. The tests allowed
researchers to not only turn on each
device, but activate functions such as
airplane mode, open websites and
interact with any smart home device
linked to the speaker.
Voice assistants vulnerable to ‘silent hacking’
The researchers have advised device
manufacturers and developers to ensure
that commands issued at frequencies
outside the range of normal human
hearing should be ignored.
How will it affect you?
Devices that are capable of modulating
a voice and playing it back at high
frequencies cost as little as $3 (£2.28),
but the researchers found that the
hacker would need to be within six feet
of the targeted speaker to go entirely
undetected and successfully target your
device. And unless the speaker is first
unlocked, a tone sounds to alert the
user. So don’t lose any sleep over
hackers targeting your smart speaker
with inaudible frequencies – unless you
share a home with them!
What do we think?
With smart devices becoming
increasingly popular, this kind of
vulnerability raises concerns that
appliances such as smart locks or
connected thermostats could be silently
controlled by a hacker. However,
we believe that the hacking threat you
face through owning a smart speaker
is probably no greater than from any
other internet-connected device.
Furthermore, we expect
manufacturers will act quickly to patch
such vulnerabilities as soon as they
become aware of them.
and has a circumference of 110mm.
Hidden beneath its mesh exterior, an
LED screen displays the time, which can
be dimmed or turned off as required.
The LF-S50G matches Google Home
for features – open your command by
saying “OK Google” and it
will answer your queries,
control your smart
devices and play music
and radio. The only
feature missing is Spotify
Connect but, on the plus
side, it includes NFC for
faster Bluetooth pairing.
What really sets Sony’s
speaker apart from the
crowd, though, is its use
of smart gesture controls.
Using your finger to trace
a circle in the air over the
top of the speaker will

Magphone
bit.ly/magphone432 | From £10
Finding a safe spot for your phone while travelling, cooking or
relaxing may be a first-world problem but that doesn’t make
the Magphone any less of a terrific idea. This portable phone
holder uses magnets to secure your handset to its dock and
lets you position it at any angle you like. Just slip the supplied metal plate
between your phone and case to magnetically place your device on any flat
surface. There’s also a MagDisc dock that lets you stick your phone to your car’s
dashboard. The team hopes to raise £20,000 for the project by 10 October.
After several difficult
years, consumer-
electronics company
HTC is now rumoured
to be in the process of
selling its phone business
to Google. Despite being
the contract
manufacturer for
Google’s Pixel line of
phones, HTC hasn’t been
very successful of late.
In fact, the company has
had a terrible few years,
with sales falling more than 54% over
the past 12 months alone.
Back in 2015, the firm’s share price fell
below its market valuation, essentially
confirming that from an investor point
of view, it was worthless. Since then,
things have shown no signs of
improving. The company, which was
once a dominant force among Android
device manufacturers, is now only
a fringe player, and it appears as though
Is Google buying HTC?
What’s new on Kickstarter
Our favourite new project on the crowdfunding site
its owners may finally throw in the
towel by selling to Google.
Sources claim that Google is only
after HTC’s phone business, so HTC as
a corporate entity could still exist after
the buyout – it just won’t make phones
any more. HTC has an extensive OEM
business (manufacturing and selling
hardware for other brands), but it isn’t
clear whether these will be snapped
up as part of the deal.
WEBOMETER
LIKELIHOOD RATING
✓✓✓✓✓
Acquiring HTC’s phone business
would allow Google to bolster its
own manufacturing arm with new
facilities, designers and engineers.
In the long term, Google would like
to replicate Apple’s business model
with its own Pixel line of phones,
having control over every aspect of
the business including the hardware.
By acquiring HTC’s major – albeit
failing – phone business, Google
would gain full control over the
production of its hardware and have
access to a wealth of expertise,
making it better equipped to
compete with Apple. However,
if Google buys HTC, you’re unlikely
to ever see the release of another
HTC-branded phone – as was the
case when Google owned Motorola
– because this would represent
a conflict of interest.

Q
How can I avoid
‘malvertising’,
like the
malicious adware
spread through
Facebook Messenger?
Tom Keane, Facebook
A
Malvertising is
increasing by
about 300% per
year, and malicious ads are
Data leaked from ‘six
million’ Instagram accounts
The personal details of
up to six million
Instagram users have
reportedly been leaked
online after a bug in the
platform made private account
information publicly accessible.
The flaw, which exposed the email
addresses and phone numbers of
both private and public accounts,
was subsequently exploited by
hackers, who were able to harvest
the data into a dark-web database,
where contact details were being
sold for $10 (£7.50) each.
While the vulnerability was initially
thought to have only affected a small
number of A-list celebrity accounts,
including singers Selena Gomez,
Taylor Swift and Harry Styles, The
Daily Beast reported that hackers
claimed to have the contact details of
as many as six million users.
typically spread through
legitimate websites or by
claiming to be a legitimate
advertiser. Current global
ransomware attacks show
that they can use almost any
online advertising platform.
To stay safe, you should
follow these simple rules to
protect your identity and
your devices:
• You should regularly
clear your browsing data to
get rid of any cookies – the
small pieces of code that
download to your browser
when you visit a website.
When you return to that
website, the cookie records
this information so targeted
ads can be directed at you.
• Protect yourself against
malicious ads by using an ad
blocker. Ads help fund free
media content, but while the
ad industry is scrambling to
find solutions to malvertising,
it’s best to stay safe and use
an ad blocker such as uBlock
Origin. But be aware that with
each additional extension,
your browser’s fingerprint
becomes easier to identify.
• Anti-tracking and
anti-cookie extensions are
among the best ways to stay
private. For example,
Disconnect Private Browsing
(disconnect.me) protects you
from tracking and malware
by blocking third-party
cookies and social networks
such as Facebook, Google,
and Twitter. Privacy Badger
(bit.ly/badger432) from
the non-profit Electronic
Frontier Foundation is
another good option.
• Install software that
blocks ads and protects
your privacy. NordVPN has
just launched CyberSec
(bit.ly/cybersec432), a new
security tool designed to
block ads, malware,
botnets and other threats.
It comes with a VPN, so it
serves a double function:
encryption and ad
blocking. CyberSec
resembles a content
blocker, but runs on the
network level. NordVPN’s
Android, Windows and
MacOS apps have a built-in
CyberSec option.

Equifax customers hit by
security breach
More than 143 million people’s data may
be at risk after credit-monitoring firm
Equifax was hit by a security breach. In a
statement revealing the breach, Equifax
said: “Criminals exploited a US website
application vulnerability to gain access to
certain files. The company has found no
evidence of unauthorised activity on
Equifax’s core consumer or commercial
credit reporting databases.”
The statement added that Equifax
identified unauthorised access to “limited
personal information for certain UK and
Canadian residents”.
Based on the company’s investigation,
the unauthorised access is thought to
have occurred
between May
and July 2017
and was
discovered on
29 July. However,
it has only just been disclosed.
Commenting on why it took so long
to alert customers, Equifax said it
acted to stop the intrusion as soon as
it discovered the unauthorised access,
engaging “a leading, independent
cybersecurity firm which has been
conducting a comprehensive forensic
review to determine the scope of the
intrusion, including the specific data
impacted. Because this incident
involves a substantial amount of
personal identifying information, the
investigation has been complex and
time-consuming. As soon as we had
enough information to begin
notification, we took appropriate steps
to do so”.

YouTube
www.youtube.com
You don’t need to be an eagle-eyed
viewer to see the most obvious change
to YouTube’s website: its logo has been
redesigned for the first time in 12 years.
The revamp also brings with it a new dark
theme (tested during the extensive beta
phase), while also ensuring the layout
looks consistent across screens small and
large. By removing the distracting visuals
of old and simplifying the left-hand
menu, the videos are pushed front and
centre. There’s also a new typeface and
colour scheme, along with some handy
touches on mobile devices, including
Library and Account tabs, and the ability
to speed up and slow down videos.
Sock Council
www.sockcouncil.com
Fancy a new pair of snazzy socks? Then
stroll over to this cleanly presented site
to check out a wide range of stylish
designs. As well as letting you sort by
newness, popularity, rating and price,
you can zoom in to see the socks up
close. There are also comprehensive
descriptions, a simple checkout and
other items to buy including t-shirts,
hats, sweatshirts and mugs. The main
problem is that stocks appear low –
a number of goods were either sold out
or down to their last item. But the socks
look great, the blog is informative and
there’s an infectious sense of fun.

TKMaxx
www.tkmaxx.com
At first, we thought TKMaxx really wanted us to buy a pair of Pearlz Velvet Knot
Trainers because every product we clicked took us back to its page. Then we realised
it was the result of an annoying bug. Unfortunately, it’s not the only one. The mobile
site has teething problems and there are some major irritants in the desktop version:
for example, clicking Search nearly always opened the drop-down menu for Bag. Iron
these out, though, and TKMaxx would have a good site on its hands. After all, it’s
visually improved and has well-laid out pages, a straightforward checkout process
and plenty of items to buy.

The Sentinel
www.stokesentinel.co.uk
Delivering news and current events about
the Staffordshire city Stoke-on-Trent, this
revamped site now feels faster, bolder
and easier to navigate. Its responsive
design works equally well on all screen
sizes and there’s a welcome emphasis on
photos, with larger images and galleries
you can browse on a single page. The
healthy mix of news, entertainment and
sport includes a breaking-news blog and
specific sections for Stoke City and Port
Vale football clubs. We like that you can
enter your postcode to see information
about your area, and enjoyed reading the
lively reader comments.

permits have been issued. It’s a shame
there is so little prominent news on the

detailed sections about education and

We can’t vouch for the quality of the

fresh, seasonal ingredients based around
easy-to-follow recipes direct from
Yorkshire to your door. The website does
a fine job of explaining the process step
by step and detailing exactly what to
expect in every artisan recipe box it
sends out. There’s a comprehensive FAQ,
profiles of suppliers and an online deli if
you prefer to buy one-off items rather
than a put-together package. Choosing
your meals is simple and there’s lots of
nutritional information. The only
annoying thing is the persistent prompt
to sign up to the newsletter.

Even if you’re not an expert in such

Farefetch
www.farefetch.com
Looking for the cheapest flights online can be a laborious task but this clever new
fare-seeking website gets savvy travellers to find them for you. Just set a minimum
price for your desired flight before sending your request to travel-booking pros.
Working with your departure and return dates, passenger numbers and choice of
airport, these ‘farefetchers’ compete to find you the best deal – the first to do so
pockets the difference between the price you set and the actual cost of the flight.
Be aware, though, that you can’t amend or cancel flights once they’re booked,
and that the price may not include extras such as baggage.

The design works well, especially on

To make browsing even easier, it provides
both Quick and Full search engines.
The pages are simply presented and
informative, and there’s a handy news

recent incidents. GMP’s Twitter feed is
also infamous for being very droll.

a host of Cornish papers. As such, it has
similar sections – News, Sport,
Entertainment, Traffic and Travel – along
with a live blog, some fun features and
data relating to specific areas. We like
that the comments facility has been
overhauled to let you create threads in
response to other users’ posts and rate
each other’s messages. Annoyingly,
videos are set to autoplay but at least
you’re not bombarded by surveys, which
is often the scourge of local-news sites.

Chrome to show warning on
non-HTTPS websites
Google is taking further steps
to encourage webmasters to
upgrade their sites from standard
HTTP to the more secure HTTPS.
If a non-HTTPS site gives a visitor
the option to enter information,
Chrome users will see a warning
message that the site is not
secure. However, this doesn’t just
apply to filling out forms and
sending personal information,
but also includes basic items such
as search boxes. The simplest way
to fix the problem is to remove
any such boxes from your site,
but if you’d rather keep them,
contact your web host and ask
about upgrading to HTTPS.
Upload WordPress images
in the background
If you publish WordPress posts
from your Android phone, you’ll
be pleased to know that the app
(bit.ly/wpa432) has recently been
enhanced. The standout upgrade
is that image uploads now take
place in the background, so you
can start an image uploading,
then go back to the post and
keep working on it – or even
publish it – without having to wait
for the image to finish uploading.

Q
I use WordPress and want to
learn a programming language.
Should I go for PHP, since that’s
what WordPress sites are built on?
Graham Burrows, via email
A
Yes, PHP seems to be the perfect
language to start with for web
development, especially if you plan
to use WordPress in the future. It’s easy to
learn but powerful at the same time, and
definitely something you should know if you
want to write your own themes or plugins.
On the other hand, JavaScript may be a
good alternative. It’s not complicated and
is very flexible. You can run JavaScript on
the client and server side, and there are
uncountable benefits of using JavaScript
with WordPress. Give both a try and see
which one suits you better.

Stream Star Trek: Discovery
From 25 September
Set 10 years before the Original Series (and marking 50 years
since it first screened), Star Trek: Discovery follows the crew of
the USS Discovery as they take on the Klingon Federation in a war
they’re only just beginning to understand. The 15-episode first
season was entirely funded by Netflix and each instalment will
appear on the streaming service the day after it’s shown on CBS
in the US. Annoyingly, the season will be broken into two
‘chapters’, with a break between 6 November and January 2018.
The crew of the Discovery includes Sonequa Martin Green (as
Lieutenant Commander Michael Burnham), Michelle Yeoh and
Jason Isaacs. Netflix says the new series will “embrace the same
ideology and hope for the future that inspired a generation of
dreamers and doers”, though that hasn’t stopped some sceptical
Trekkies accusing the producers of disregarding series creator
Gene Roddenberry’s utopian ‘rules’, such as there never being
conflict between Starfleet crew members. However, judging by
the exciting, high-quality trailers, we think Netflix is on to a winner.
You can discuss every episode as soon as it ‘drops’ on Netflix
on our sister site Den of Geek (www.denofgeek.com).
Pick of the fortnight
Catch Bond in Spectre
From 22 September
Nearly two years after it hit cinemas
and earned a colossal $880m (£675m),
the most recent James Bond film is now
available to watch on Netflix, in all its
action-packed, product-placing and
slightly preposterous glory. Until Daniel
Craig changed his mind last month,
Spectre was believed to be his final
outing as 007, and he certainly would
have gone out with a bang, with
Christoph Waltz providing a worthy
foe and Monica Bellucci making the
most of her short screen time.
Surprisingly, none of the other 23
Bond films are currently on Netflix,
at least in the UK.

Sky has launched a month-long Sky
Cinema channel dedicated to sci-fi films,
and you don’t need a Sky subscription
to enjoy it. The ‘Sky-Fi channel’ is
screening the entire Star Wars series –
including The Force Awakens and
Rogue One – alongside all 10 Star Trek
movies and sci-fi
classics including
Close Encounters of
the Third Kind,
Minority Report,
Blade Runner and

veteran-turned-detective Cormoran
Strike as he mopes about London
solving complex cases. Following the
critically acclaimed ‘Cuckoo’s Calling’,
which is still available on iPlayer, ‘The

you watch live channels and on-demand
programmes on the go. These include
AMC (home of Fear The Walking Dead),
Comedy Central, Discovery and BT
Sport. The new app offers better
integration with the BT TV Player on

on watching a show where you left off,
record programmes remotely from your
mobile device and save them to view
later. BT Player is also available online,
so you can stream to your PC or laptop.

real time
Live streams on YouTube are usually
accompanied by live comments, but
the two are rarely in sync, with the
discussion
often some
way behind
the action.
YouTube has
now fixed this
problem by
introducing a new ‘ultra-low-latency’
option (bit.ly/latency432) that lets
content creators interact with viewers in
near-real time “with minimal buffering”,
so they can answer questions, read
feedback on their streams and
moderate troublesome commenters.
See Best New Websites on page 14
for more about YouTube’s new features.
Install Plex for Kodi
Media-streaming software Plex
is now free to use on rival service Kodi,
so you can watch all your video content
in one place without needing to switch
between the two. The Plex add-on
(bit.ly/plex432) was previously only
available to Kodi users with a Plex Pass
subscription, but now everyone can use
its slick interface to manage and enjoy
their videos, photos and music, giving
you the best of both worlds.
Test the new iPlayer for iOS
The BBC has long let Android
users play around with experimental
versions of its iPlayer app, and now
iPhone and iPad
users can join
the fun. The
Beeb is actively
recruiting
guinea pigs for
its iOS Beta
programme

“improvements
to the download experience” before
everyone else. To join the beta testing,
click the ‘Keep me updated’ button at

Budget phone head-to-head Product Test
20 Sept - 3 Oct 2017 23
Discuss this review at forum.webuser.co.uk
phones on very affordable
monthly plans through your
preferred network, but it pays
to shop around.
Build quality
You may expect build quality
to be closely linked to price
but all three of these phones
have the kind of high-quality
metal cases you’d expect to
see on more costly models.
The Galaxy J5 can’t be
faulted and provides
a flagship feel at a fraction
of the price. At first glance,
it looks a lot like Samsung
phones of old, right down to
the centrally placed Home
button, which now doubles as
a fingerprint reader. But flip it
over and you’ll see
improvements over last year’s
version. Samsung has
managed to get rid of the
chunky camera bump of last
year’s model, so the rear
camera now sits flush with the
case. This means you can
place it flat on your desk with
no risk of scratching the lens.
Its all-metal unibody design
feels more substantial than
the plastic casing of its
predecessor, with rounded,
“chamfered” edges that allow
it to sit snug in your palm.
The Nokia 5 feels every bit
as high-end as the Galaxy J5.
Its soft round edges make the
device easy to hold, and its
sturdy aluminium body looks
like it should survive a knock
or two. It also has a
fingerprint sensor built
into the Home button.
Even the cheaper Moto E4
comes with a metal body and
looks every bit as good as its
rivals, with a gently curved,
textured back and rounded
edges. Its slightly raised glass
front seamlessly joins the
metal body, with no
overhanging lip. Our only
gripe is the conspicuous Moto
logo not-so subtly placed
above the display.
All three phones are
equipped with micro-USB
charging ports, so if you were
hoping to move over to
USB-C (which charges
devices faster), you’ll have to
look elsewhere. Thankfully,
none of the phones has
ditched the 3.5mm
headphone socket, so you
can still use your existing
headphones with them.
Screen and display
While the build of these
phones is able to compete
with their top-of-the-range
counterparts, there’s a
marked drop in screen quality.
All three displays have
resolutions of 1,280 x 720
pixels. Still, the Samsung
Super AMOLED panel is rich
and vivid, covering 98.5% of
the sRGB standard colour
palette and the Nokia 5 does
almost as well in this test,
managing 92.8%. However,
the Moto E4 trails far behind
with only 75.7% coverage.
The Nokia 5 is the best for
reading in glaring sunlight and
has a maximum brightness of
578cd/m2 (candles per square
metre), which is one of the
brightest screens we’ve ever
seen. To put this in context,
the maximum brightness of
the Moto E4 is 386cd/m2
and Samsung’s is even less
impressive at 300cd/m2.
This is on the low side
and means it wouldn’t
be ideal for outdoor use
in very bright sunlight,
although it’s passable.

Product Test Budget phone head-to-head
Samsung’s updated Galaxy J5 does
everything you could ask for. It’s a solid
performer when compared side-by-side
with its competition, battery life is
excellent, the new design is top-notch
and its camera is much improved over
last year’s model. However, at more
than £200, it may be priced beyond
your threshold for a budget phone.
The Nokia 5 is an attractive phone, but it
lacks a standout feature to justify choosing
it over the J5. Its biggest strength is the
extremely bright screen and its impressive
battery life, but we don’t feel that’s enough
to swing the deal.
For the price, Motorola’s Moto E4 is a very
impressive phone. Its performance may be
middling, and the camera has its limitations,
but overall it’s an attractive and capable
handset with no serious shortcomings.
If you can’t afford the J5, it’s a great-value
handset that’s well worth considering.
OUR VERDICT
Battery life
We test battery life by fully
charging the phones, setting
their screens to the same
brightness, then running
a looping video on the
devices, measuring how long
it takes for the phone to run
out of power and shut down.
The test was aced by the
most expensive phone – the
Galaxy J5 – which lasted for
18 hours and 26 minutes. It’s
an impressive result that will
easily get you through a day’s
use on a single charge and,
as a point of interest, is nearly
two hours longer than the
battery life of Samsung’s
flagship Galaxy S8.
The Nokia 5 battery also
fared well, lasting 14 hours
and 53 minutes, but the Moto
E4 wasn’t as impressive,
lasting just 10 hours and 20
minutes. However, we reckon
that’s still enough to provide
a day’s worth of moderate use
on a full charge.
a little drab. Toggle on the
HDR and images suddenly
come to life: everything
becomes a lot brighter and
more colourful. Without HDR
enabled, colours are dark, but
image detail is good. Low-
light HDR performance isn’t
the best, though, with image
noise obscuring detail.
Turning on the flash improves
the lighting and gives much
sharper pictures, but also
gives everything an
unwelcome blue tint.
The cheapest phone of the
group once again suffers from
its budget restrictions. The
Moto E4 is only capable of
taking 8-megapixel photos,
although in good light you’re
generally treated to a clear
and vibrant shot with well-
balanced tones. Brickwork –
a notoriously tricky test for
a budget phone camera –
is well defined, too. However,
in low light, the Moto E4
doesn’t fare so well. We found
it struggled to capture enough
light, resulting in grainy shots
and ill-defined images. The
built-in flash helps cut
through the darkness but
affects the overall tone.
For better images, you’ll have
to spend a bit more.
Performance
While build and screen quality
is fairly even between the
three phones in this test,
the difference in their
performance is noticeably
affected by price. The most
expensive of the three – the
Samsung Galaxy J5 – did the
best in our tests, helped along
by its dual-core Exynos 7870
processor and 2GB of
memory. In Geekbench 4’s
multi-core test, it scored
3,736, which is an increase of
almost 50% over the results
we saw with last year’s model.
It impressed in single-core
performance, too, scoring
a total of 800.
The Nokia 5’s eight-core
1.4GHz Snapdragon 430
processor and 2GB of RAM
sound impressive but it failed
to match the performance of
the J5, scoring 2,845 in the
multi-core test and 669 in the
single-core test.
The Moto E4 is the
cheapest of the three by
some margin and only
managed a result of 1,529 in
the multi-core test and a
single-core result of 555.
It, too, comes with 2GB of
RAM but has a less-impressive
quad-core Mediatek MT6737
processor.
Interestingly, we didn’t get
the same order of results
when running our 3D-gaming
tests, where the Nokia 5
produced the best results,
running the GFXBench
Manhattan 3.0 on-screen test
at 14fps (frames per second).
This isn’t fast enough to
seamlessly run the most
demanding 3D games but it’s
impressive for a phone of this
price and it knocked the
Samsung’s Galaxy J5 into
second place with its 10fps
result in the same test.
Bringing up the rear again
was the Moto E4, which only
managed 5fps, although it’s
still fine for running most
casual games.
Camera quality
Few people these days use a
dedicated camera and most
of us now take snaps with our
phones, so it’s important that
it’s a good one. Budget
phones are notorious for
cutting corners in this area,
as was evinced by last year’s
version of the Samsung
Galaxy J5, which had a
tendency to over-expose
photos. Despite having similar
specs on paper, with a
13-megapixels resolution
sensor, the 2017 version is a
marked improvement over the
old model. The images we
took with it were clear and
well-defined, with outstanding
colour reproduction and very
little visible noise. It handled
low-light situations very well,
while daylight shots were
packed with detail. Even
tricky subjects such as foliage
were captured with
outstanding clarity. No doubt
about it, this is a much more
versatile camera than you’d
expect for the price.
The Nokia 5’s rear camera
is also a 13-megapixel model.
Detail is good, and there isn’t
any noticeable smearing,
although the default settings
produce results that look

your browsing can’t be compromised,
ProtonVPN secures your connection

and doesn’t record anything you do,
so there are no logs or tracking to
worry about.
Like most free VPN tools, ProtonVPN
has some restrictions to be aware of:
it limits the number of countries you can
pretend to be browsing from to just
three, throttles your connection speed

StickyPad is a simple and
straightforward sticky-note
tool but it’s riddled with
distracting irritations.
For starters, it uses
Windows XP-style icons,
which look dated and out
of place, and it doesn’t let
you use non-text elements
such as images in your
notes, which is limiting.
It also turns every note
into a Desktop icon, even
if it’s closed, which creates
a lot of clutter very quickly.
If you’re a fan of point-and-click
adventures but also enjoy platformers,
then you’ll love Archimoulin, which
combines both to great effect. It’s a
short, highly-polished student project,
in which the aim is to gather the

need 7-Zip (www.7-zip.org) to open the
download, which is in 7z format.

Play Chrome’s dinosaur
game full-screen
We love Chrome’s hidden dinosaur
game, which you can play to keep
yourself amused when you go offline or
by visiting chrome://dino and pressing
the spacebar. Now Google has made it
even better by adding an ‘arcade mode’,
which enlarges the game to fill your
browser and removes the unsightly error
message. To activate this mode, simply
press the spacebar twice when viewing
the page. As before, the aim of the game
is to guide your running dinosaur across
a barren landscape, making it leap over
cacti by hitting the spacebar. That’s all
there is to it, really, except the pace gets
increasingly faster and further obstacles
appear in the form of pterodactyls and
a surprise switch to ‘night mode’ when
you exceed a score of 750.
Unload unused tabs to view

The more tabs you have open in
Chrome, the more memory it uses,
but you might be reluctant to close
As regular readers of this section know, we love extensions
that decorate your New Tab page with pretty pictures, and
Mustsee (bit.ly/mustsee432) is one of the most attractive
we’ve come across. Open a new tab to view random photos of
beautiful places as selected by travel experts: if you don’t
think an image is special enough, click the target button at
the top of the page to view another one.
The add-on isn’t just aesthetically pleasing,
but also lets you learn about the places in
the pictures by clicking the ‘learn more’
button in the bottom-left corner. You can
even get directions if you’re feeling
particularly inspired. Our selection
included gorgeous shots of Casa
Vicens in Barcelona, Antelope
Canyon in Arizona and Bryggen Wharf
in Norway. Mustsee is a must-install.
is surely the most stylish and
sophisticated font available, and the
best way to get people to take your
work seriously. Yes, we’re being
sarcastic, but that doesn’t stop us
being amused by a new extension
called Comic Sans Everything (bit.ly/
comic432), which converts all text
on web pages to the font once
described as “the most hated in the
world”. You can turn the effect on
and off with a single click, and
switch between upper- and lower-
case letters. Even if you’re not
a Comic Sans fan, it’s a fun add-on
for pranking other people and –
more usefully – could prove
beneficial for dyslexic PC users:

pages you want to view later. Rather
than adding multiple bookmarks, you
can use Dog Ear (bit.ly/dogear432) to
temporarily ‘unload’ unused tabs, and
save them in a list to reopen later. Just
click the toolbar button to unload tabs
individually, or right-click it and choose
‘Dog Ear all tabs’; the list of unloaded
tabs then appears on your New Tab
page so you can easily restore them.
Dog Ear works in a similar way to the

Mute sound on all websites
automatically
Whoever first thought that auto-
playing audio on websites was a good
idea was either hard of hearing or had
a very twisted sense of humour. With
the possible exception of YouTube,
we can’t think of any sites on which
it’s welcome to have sound blast
through your speakers or headphones
the minute you load them, which
makes ‘Mute sites by default’ (bit.ly/
mute432) a brilliant idea. As its name
suggests, this add-on assumes that you
don’t want to jump out of your skin while
browsing the web and silences all online
sound accordingly, unless you tell it not to.
You can ‘unmute’ a tab by either clicking
the speaker icon, pressing Ctrl+M or
right-clicking and choosing Unmute Tab;
and create a whitelist of sites on which to
always allow auto-playing sound.
Check your Firefox version
number
So, which version of Firefox are you
running? If you had to look to find out
– by going to Help, About Firefox and
waiting for the info window to open –
you’ll appreciate a new add-on called
Version in Toolbar (bit.ly/version432).
This shows your current version number
in an icon on the toolbar (Firefox 56
is set for
release on
26 September),
so you can
instantly see
whether the
browser is
up to date.
There’s an
accompanying
add-on called
Minor Version in Toolbar, which tells you
the full number – for example, 56.0.3
– but this isn’t essential unless you’re
fastidious about such things!
Discover the real location
of websites
Web domains can be deceptive – many
sites with URLs ending in ‘.com’ aren’t
located in the US, while webmasters
Browse more fluidly
in Edge
After a slow start,
Microsoft’s Edge browser is
finally gaining some useful
extensions, though the tally
is still only in double figures
compared to the thousands
available for Chrome and Firefox.
Our favourite recent addition is
Mile Wide Back (bit.ly/mile432),
which makes it easy to move
back and forth through your
browsing history, and between
open tabs, with fewer clicks. It
uses the concept of an “infinitely
wide” button on the left-hand
side of your screen: you left-click
to navigate back in your browser
history, right-click to go forward
and rotate the mouse wheel to
cycle through open tabs.
Sort your Vivaldi
downloads by type
Back in Issue 424, we
reported that Vivaldi had
introduced the useful option to
sort the files in your Downloads
folder by various different
criteria, including name, size,
date added, date finished and
web address. This feature has
now been made even more
useful with
the ability
to sort
downloads
by type,
too, which
makes it
much
easier to
find the
items you want. Just click the
menu bar above the Downloads
list and use the options provided
to choose how you want to sort

Lonely Planet is now 45
years old, so it’s about
time the travel-publishing
giant made its beautifully
written guides available on
your phone and tablet to
browse offline.
Some of its guides,
anyway. The app currently
only covers cities, so while
you’ll be able to access
a downloaded guide even
if you’re up a mountain
or down a canyon, far
away from an internet
connection, you won’t find
a guide that covers that location (unless it’s Table
Mountain in the middle of Cape Town, or a canyon between
two blocks of New York skyscrapers). What’s more, the app
currently only covers around 100 cities, which isn’t many
– as you’ll realise when you start searching. No Riga, Seville,
Melbourne or Tijuana, and that’s just the first four cities we
thought of! But more are being added every month, and
you can vote for cities to help push them up the shortlist.
But while the guides are low(ish) on quantity, they’re high
on quality. Each one contains curated collections of articles
produced by Lonely Planet writers who know the locale
intimately or even live there. Tap an item – such as a
restaurant or landmark – to open a whole section about it,
including ratings and prices. Annoyingly, you can’t select an
item on the zoomable map to
open its page; you have to tap
its name or thumbnail. Each
guide also has a ‘Need to Know’
section with a public transport
map and other local info, plus
an audio phrasebook with basic
phrases in a few languages.
To unlock all 19 languages,
you’ll have to cough up £5.49
via an in-app purchase.
You don’t need to create an
account to use the app, but it’s
free to do and means you can
save pages to

Packr is a smart
packing
checklist that
uses artificial intelligence to help you
plan. Tell it where you’re going, where
you’re staying and what you’ll be doing,
and it’ll calculate whether you should
pack your sandals or your sou’wester.
It’s a great idea, but limited in practice.
It doesn’t let you edit the list it
generates, and if you
want to sync between
iOS devices, you have to
buy an in-app upgrade,
starting at £1.99.

38 20 Sept - 3 Oct 2017
Google has released the
latest update to its mobile
operating system. David
Crookes reveals whether it
tastes as sweet as it sounds
Our guide to
Android Oreo
Is this a new kind of biscuit?
Ah, we knew you’d bite. It is actually the
latest version of the Android operating
system – also known as
version 8.0 – and, as with
previous iterations,
it’s nicknamed after
a sweet treat. This is
the second time
a confectionery brand
has been associated
with Android, the first
being Android KitKat
back in 2013. As always,
though, Android is
hoping the raft of new
features it brings will
be to your taste.
How different is it to previous
versions?
Google has resisted giving its operating
system a complete overhaul, but it’s
added a good number of features that
should make Android easier to use and
ensure it’s more efficient at performing
certain tasks. One of the first things you’ll
notice is the boot speed when powering
up, which is twice as fast as before.
Oreo also frees up the system’s overall
resources by intelligently minimising
background activity in the apps you use
the least, which should also give the
battery life a boost.
What new features should I be
looking out for?
From a visual perspective, the most
notable addition is picture-in-picture
(PIP) multitasking, which allows you to
run two apps at once. This feature was
actually introduced in Android Nougat
for Android TV, but this brings PIP to all
devices running 8.0. It’s been designed to
work during video calls or while watching
a video.
By placing
either app
in a small
corner of the
screen, you
can chat with
someone
or continue
watching
videos while
doing other
things on
your device,
such as
checking
a map or
an email.
Which apps does picture-in-
picture work with?
You can use picture-in-picture with
YouTube, but you need a Red
subscription, which isn’t yet available
in the UK. However, it works with videos
in Chrome and more apps will use the
feature in the near future. Don’t worry
about the PIP window getting in the way,
either, because you can move it around
the screen or dismiss it by dragging it off
the bottom. There is also better audio
thanks to new codecs that improve the
sound quality through headphones and
wireless speakers. This will enhance your
video viewing.
Have there been changes to
notifications?
There have indeed. Borrowing from iOS,
Android Oreo has notification dots that
appear on an app’s icon whenever there

Android Oreo
is an alert related to it. These let you see
at a glance what is new and you can
long-press an icon to see a preview of
the alert before swiping it away. Unlike
iOS, you won’t see a number indicating,
for instance, how many unread email
messages you have. But there are new
notifications channels that separate
notifications deemed important by the
developers from those that aren’t. You
can also fine-tune the notifications in the
Settings app and use the new snooze
function to delay them until you’re ready
to deal with them.
Do you get better overall control
over Oreo, then?
Yes. The settings app has been
redesigned, removing the slideout and
three-line hamburger menus, and placing
familiar options within different
categories. You can check whether or not
you are connected to a public Wi-Fi
network, create a customisable lock-
screen shortcut and use fingerprint-
scanner gestures. Oreo also lets you
manage the volume of the notifications
and block them according to the channel
in which they are placed: in the past,
you’ve only been able to control them
for specific apps.
Does Oreo
improve the
ability to
handle text?
It does. Oreo’s
autofill function
remembers your
logins, credit
cards, addresses
and more so you
can access your
apps much more
quickly. You have
to grant it
permission to do
this but it will
work well across
devices and within
This is an attempt to get Oreo and future
updates on as many devices as possible
in the shortest possible time. One of
the major problems with Android is that,
unlike iOS, a new version isn’t instantly
available to all because device
manufacturers have to retool it for their
hardware, which costs time and money.
Project Treble makes it easier for
manufacturers to adapt Android for
their existing devices.
So when can I try Oreo?
As always, it is being rolled out in stages
but it should be available for your device
by the end of the year (it was launched
on 21 August). If you own one of the
major handsets such as a recent
Samsung Galaxy, a OnePlus 3 or 5
or an LG G5 or G6, then you should see
it soon. Priority has been given to owners
of Google’s own phones including the
Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X
but joining the Beta Program at android
.com/beta can grant you earlier access.
Android likes to hide an Easter Egg in its operating system
and Oreo is no exception. To see it, open the Settings app,
select System, ‘About phone’ and tap ‘Android version’
repeatedly until a large ‘O’ appears on the screen. Tap this
continuously, then long-press to unlock the surprise.
One of the biggest changes in Android
Oreo is a redesigned set of emoji, which
ditches the blobby old designs in favour
of rounder versions. The emoji also
include 69 new images ranging from
an exploding head (“mind blown”) and
shushing face to a dinosaur and giraffe.
Better representative of gender, race
and religion, they are included in the
Unicode 10 emoji set and increase the
number of available images to more
than 2,000. To see a full set online,
visit emojipedia.org/google/new.

apps. There’s also a more
intelligent method of
selecting text. Oreo picks
up on the potential uses
of the text you highlight.
This means it will suggest
going to Google Maps if
you’ve selected an address
or to the phone app if you’ve
highlighted a telephone number.
Are apps still a big part
of Android’s future?
Yes, but there’s also an interesting new
feature called Android Instant Apps. This
lets you use apps in your browser without
actually installing them. When you tap
a link in a browser, Google Play checks
whether there is an app that can open it.
The link is then opened in the portion of
the app needed to perform that action.
There are also tighter controls on the
installation of apps (Google isn’t saying
how it achieves this) and more prominent
security options in Settings, which you’ll
now find under Security and Location
rather than buried deep. In other words,
security is far more central to Android
than it has been before.

t’s hardly a secret that when you go
online, your activities are followed
– not only by Google, Facebook and
Amazon, but by official surveillance
teams, ‘just in case’ you’re a criminal
in waiting. In Web User, we often
recommend privacy add-ons and
software that block at least some
web trackers, but if you really want
to preserve your anonymity, Tor is
the best option available.
This stealthy browser keeps your
web activities safe from spammers
and advertisers, hides your personal
data from corporations and other
web users, and lets you browse
without being followed by identity
thieves and stalkers. You can send
personal photos without having them
intercepted, use social networks
without being monitored, write
genuinely anonymous blog posts
and much more.
In this privacy special, we explain
how to make the most of Tor’s
anonymity tools and ensure you stay
safe when browsing what’s referred
to – somewhat misleadingly – as the
Dark Web. We outline our essential
dos and don’ts for using the browser

interesting sites that can only
be accessed through Tor.

sounds far too risky, be reassured by

to the internet.
There’s also a Tor
app for Android,
called Orbot (bit.ly/
orbot432); and an
operating system –
Tails (tails.boum.org) –
that’s preconfigured to use Tor.
WHO USES TOR?
The police, the military, medical
researchers, human-rights groups,
abuse victims, whistleblowers,
journalists and, increasingly, anyone else
who wants to keep their online activities
private or is concerned about cyber-
spying. It is very popular among people
in internet-censored countries such as
Russia and the UAE, and counts Human
Rights Watch among its past donors.
NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden
is a big fan and says: “Without Tor, the
streets of the internet become like the
streets of a very heavily surveilled city.
With Tor, we have private spaces and
private lives, where we can choose who
we want to associate with and how”.
HOW POPULAR IS IT?
The most recent figures (metrics
.torproject.org) suggest Tor has around
2.5 million daily users, with Facebook’s
Tor-only website alone (see page 42)
attracting more than a million visitors
every month. The US has the most Tor
users (19% of the total number) with the
UK in seventh place (3.4%).
BUT ISN’T TOR A BIT DODGY?
Every medium, from the printed page to
a standard browser, has the potential to
be dodgy, but web services do not
commit ‘actions’ – their users do. As
with technology such as Bitcoin – Tor’s
preferred currency – Tor does not incite
or condone illegal enterprises. On its
website, it recognises that criminal
YOUR TOR QUESTIONS ANSWERED
elements exploit anonymity, but
points out: “Criminals can already
do bad things... they already have lots
of options available”.
For every lawbreaker, there are
numerous legitimate users, many of
whom use Tor to great social benefit.
SO IT’S COMPLETELY LEGAL?
Yes, completely. The US Navy isn’t in
the habit of creating illegal software,
and there’s nothing dubious about
wanting to browse in private. Nobody
has ever been arrested or prosecuted
solely for using Tor, only for what they
used it to do, and Tor itself says
in its legal FAQ that “it is not a tool
designed or intended to be used
to break the law” (bit.ly/legal432).
AND IT’S COMPLETELY SAFE?
As with many online tools, that
depends on what you use it for.
Many people have reservations about
browsing with Tor because it provides
access to the so-called Dark Web,
where they fear they might stumble
across disturbing and illegal content.
However, Tor doesn’t blithely offer
you a directory of links so you can
start exploring Dark Web sites –
you need to know the exact web
addresses, which usually consist of
a jumble of 16 characters and the
domain ‘.onion’. All the same, it pays
to be vigilant and you should avoid
opening suspicious files and links.
We explain what to do (and what
not to do) in order to stay safe on Tor,
on page 43.
WHAT IS TOR?
Tor (www.torproject.org) is an
anonymity network that hides your
identity as you browse the web, share
content and engage in other online
activities. It encrypts any data
sent from your computer,
so that no one can see
who or where you are,
even when you’re logged
into a website. Tor is an
acronym for The Onion
Router, and it was created
by the US Naval Research
Laboratory in the mid-Nineties.
WHAT’S IT GOT TO DO WITH
ONIONS?
It’s all about layers. The data from
your computer is sent through a series
of ‘nodes’ (other computers, also
known as ‘relays’) run by millions of
volunteers around the world, building
up layers of encryption like the layers
of an onion. Tor gives you a different
IP address every time you send or
request data, disguising your real one
and making it nearly impossible for
prying eyes to know where the data
originated.
HOW DO I USE TOR?
The easiest way to use Tor is through
its dedicated browser (bit.ly/
torbrowser432), which is available for
Windows, MacOS and Linux (it can
be run from a USB stick if you don’t
want to install it on your computer).
The Tor browser is based on Firefox,
but disables plugins that could
compromise your privacy and
security. It won’t clash with other
software you have installed, but you
may need to configure your antivirus
program or firewall to allow it access

Install and run Tor, and opt to connect directly to the Tor
network. Before you start browsing, click the onion icon
to the left of the address bar. 1 Here, you can see and
change the ‘circuit’ of nodes through which your connection
is routed, and the IP addresses and countries used. 2
2
Click Security Settings to set a security level. Low is the
default, 1 which enables all standard browser features
but may leave you compromised. Medium 2 boosts security
by turning off some risky scripts and media, while High 3
disables them all, and may leave the web looking rather bare.
3
The preinstalled NoScript add-on blocks some scripts.
If you chose Medium or High security level, you can still
run scripts on certain sites by clicking the ‘S’ button 1 and
temporarily allowing them. 2 To create a whitelist of allowed
sites, choose Options, Whitelist and enter the URLs. 3
4
Tor’s default search engine is DuckDuckGo, but you can
click the search icon 1 to switch to another, such as the
equally private Disconnect or Startpage, or the Tor-specific
DuckDuckGoOnion. Click Change Search Settings 2 to set
one of these as the default from the drop-down menu. 3

As in any browser, Tor ‘.onion’ sites are accessed via the
address bar. If they won’t load, click the onion icon and
choose Tor Network Settings. Select the ISP option 1 to
connect using secret entry points (‘bridges’); or computer
options to connect via a proxy 2 or alternative ports. 3

ESSENTIAL DOS AND DON’TS FOR TOR
Maximise
the Tor window
Leave Tor browser windows at their
default size because maximising them
allows websites to determine the size
of your monitor. This might not sound
too worrying on its own but when
combined with other information,
it may provide the extra information
websites need to identify you.
Use a VPN
alongside Tor
It’s important to remember that Tor
is a proxy rather than a VPN, which
means it only protects traffic routed
through the Tor browser. As we
explained earlier, there are some risks
to using the Tor network, especially
when downloading torrent files and
inadvertently connecting through a
malicious exit node. You can boost
your privacy and security by using Tor
in conjunction with a VPN, to ensure
all your data is encrypted and no logs
are kept of your activities. Several
VPNs offer features designed
specifically for Tor users, including
ProtonVPN (bit.ly/provpn432) –
see Best Free Software on page 26
– which lets you access servers
pre-configured to redirect traffic
through the Tor network; ExpressVPN,
which lets you sign up anonymously
through its ‘.onion’ website
(expressobutiolem.onion);
and AirVPN (airvpn.org),
which routes traffic through
the Tor network first and
then through the VPN.
None of these options are
free – prices generally start
at £5 per month – but they
are faster, more flexible
and more trustworthy than
free VPN services.
Make sure Tor is kept
up to date
Tor is much more secure than Chrome
and Firefox but as with any piece of
software, it’s not impervious to
attack. For example, the network was
targeted in 2013 by a Trojan called
Chewbacca, which stole banking
details; and in 2016, it was revealed
that the FBI had used specially
created malware called Torsploit
to ‘deanonymise’ Tor users and track
their real IP addresses (bit.ly/
torsploit432). There have also been
cases of Tor exit nodes – the last
relays that Tor traffic passes through
before it reaches its destination –
being used for malicious purposes
rather than anonymous ones, and
infecting users’ systems.
Fortunately, Tor usually addresses
such threats and vulnerabilities very
swiftly, which makes it essential to
keep the browser up to date. Every
time you launch Tor, click the onion
icon on the toolbar and choose ‘Check
for Tor Browser Update’ (Tor updates
itself periodically, but checking
manually ensures you’re using the
latest version). Additionally, if you’re
using a service that involves sharing
personal information, you should
change Tor’s security level to High, as
explained in our Workshop opposite.
Use Tor for
torrenting
As a powerful privacy tool,
Tor might seem like the
perfect means of
downloading and
uploading files via
BitTorrent and other
peer-to-peer networks,
but it absolutely is not!
Using a torrent client
bypasses Tor’s protection
and blows your anonymity by sending
your real IP address to the torrent
service and other ‘peers’. This allows
them to identify you, the port you’re
using for torrenting and even the data
you’re sharing, if it isn’t encrypted.
They can then potentially target you
with malware or even notify the
relevant authorities (if you’re sharing
copyrighted material). Additionally,
torrent traffic places a heavy strain on
the Tor network and slows it down for
others, so it’s selfish as well as careless.
For all these reasons, Tor says
file-sharing is “widely unwanted”
and exit nodes are configured to block
torrent traffic by default.
Create a new identity
when necessary
Tor does a great job of keeping you
safe and anonymous, but you may still
encounter websites that raise alarm
bells – indeed, Tor may warn you that
a site is trying to track you. If you’re
worried that your privacy has been
compromised, click the onion icon on
the toolbar and choose New Identity.
This will restart the Tor browser and
reset your IP address, so you can carry
on browsing as a fresh user.
As we explain in our Workshop,
opposite, you can also create a new
Tor circuit, but this will only change your
IP address for the current page, not the
whole browsing session.
There are lots of secret hacks for making the most of the Tor network
as well as pitfalls to avoid. Here’s how to be smart and safe

44 20 Sept - 3 Oct 2017
Search the web
using Google
Google isn’t known for respecting its
users’ privacy, so to continue using it
in Tor (it’s one of the available options)
is rather self-defeating. Not only does
Google still try to track you and record
your searches (based on your exit
node’s IP address) but when it finds
you’re connecting in an ‘unusual’
manner, it gets very uppity about it.
Try searching with Google in Tor
and you’ll continually get CAPTCHAs
that ask you to prove you’re not
a robot. We recommend using
either Tor’s default search engine
DuckDuckGo, its ‘Onion’ variant or
Startpage (which uses non-tracked
Google results), all of which come
preinstalled alongside Google.
Consider running
a Tor relay
Tor relies on its loyal and ever-
expanding community to provide the
relays that create the circuits that
deliver the anonymity it’s become
(in)famous for. The more relays – or
‘nodes’ – there are running, the faster
and more secure the Tor network will
be. If you become a regular Tor user,
consider giving something back to
the community by sharing your
bandwidth and running your own
relay. You can either be a ‘middle
relay’ – one of the two or more nodes
that receives Tor traffic and then
passes it on – or an ‘exit relay’. Being
a middle relay is much safer because
if another user employs the Tor
network to do something malicious
or illegal, your IP address will not
show up as the source of the traffic.
In contrast, an exit relay can be
identified as that source, which means
people who run exit relays may have
to deal with complaints and even legal
attention. Therefore you shouldn’t
host an exit node from your home PC
and, if you’re sensible, not at all!
One further problem: you need to
have a Linux computer running Debian
or Ubuntu to host a reliable relay – see
Tor’s instructions at bit.ly/relay432. In
Windows, you need to run a Linux distro
as a virtual machine and set up your
relay from there. It’s a bit of a hassle,
but at least it will keep your Tor traffic
separate from the rest of your system.
Share your
real email address
It may sound obvious, but there’s no
point using Tor to stay anonymous if
you sign up to a website using your real
email address. It’s like putting a paper
bag over your head, then scrawling your
name and address on it. A disposable
email service such as MailDrop
(maildrop.cc) or Nada (getnada.com),
or the brilliant Fake Name Generator
(www.fakenamegenerator.com) can be
used to create a temporary address
and/or identity for site registrations
and keep your Tor persona separate
from your standard web one.
Use Tor for
anonymous email
You can use your favourite email
services in Tor – although pesky Google
may ask you to verify your Gmail
account – but the content of your
messages won’t be encrypted in transit.
Tor will of course disguise where you
are, but unless you’re using a disposable
email address (see above), anyone
intercepting your messages will see
your real address and, potentially,
your name.
For total privacy and anonymity,
you can use a Tor-enabled email
service. Several of these have been
closed down by law-enforcement
agencies in recent years because
they were linked to criminal activities,
but using one is not illegal, nor does
it place you under suspicion. The
best and most trustworthy option
is ProtonMail (protonmail.com),
an end-to-end encrypted-email
provider, launched by the CERN
research facility in 2013.
Earlier this year, ProtonMail
introduced a Tor hidden service
specifically to combat the censorship
and surveillance of its users. You can
sign up for a free ProtonMail account
at protonirockerxow.onion, but this
limits you to 500MB of storage
and 150 messages per day; to get
advanced features, you need the
Plus plan for ¤4 (£3.70) per month.
Alternatively, you could try
Bitmessage, a free Desktop client that
lets you send and receive encrypted
messages using Tor, and can be run
from a USB stick. It offers both
standard (bitmessage.org) and Tor
(bitmailendavkbec.onion) websites.
Go overboard with
browser add-ons
Because Tor is based on Firefox,
it’s possible to install your favourite
add-ons to customise it to your
preference, which makes sense if
you are planning to use Tor as your
default browser. Don’t be tempted!
Even if extensions aren’t infected
with malware (as some Chrome ones
were recently found to be), they may
seriously compromise your privacy.
Tor comes with two of the best
protective add-ons preinstalled –
NoScript and HTTPS Everywhere
– and that’s really all you need if your
reason for switching to the browser is
to be anonymous. Also, bear in mind
that browsing with Tor can be slower
than Chrome or Firefox because of
its roundabout way of connecting,
so overloading it with add-ons will
further reduce your speed.
Google doesn’t like you using Tor
and will continually try to track you

WHERE TO VISIT USING TOR
Facebook
www.facebookcorewwwi.onion
Yes, we realise the irony: the social
network renowned for harvesting its
users’ data for advertising purposes
has a special private version that can
only be accessed through Tor. You
might wonder how this works – surely
you can’t be anonymous on Facebook
or friends won’t be able to find you
(and vice versa). But the idea is to
provide a secure and reliable method
of communication for people worried
about cybersurveillance. More than
one million people use the hidden site,
which is also available on Android
(bit.ly/facebook432).
ProPublica
www.propub3r6espa33w.onion
Winner of four Pulitzer prizes – and
the first online publication to win the
award – this non-profit news site’s
mission is to “expose abuses of power
and betrayals of the public trust by
government, business and other
institutions”. Not only does ProPublica’s
‘.onion’ site put paid to the notion that
only dubious content can be found on
the Dark Web, but it allows people in
internet-censored countries to read its
fearless investigative journalism via Tor,
without fear of reprisal.
DuckDuckGo
3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion
As we’ve mentioned, DuckDuckGo is
Tor’s default search engine but it’s also
worth bookmarking its ‘.onion’ site, if
only to see that the Dark Web hasn’t
wiped the smile from the happy logo’s
bill. Indeed, the privacy-loving bird
thrives on the freedom and anonymity
offered by the browser, letting you
quickly search the web without being
spied on. DuckDuckGo’s ‘bang’
commands can be used to search
thousands of sites by typing, for
example, !w for Wikipedia followed by
a search term.
Intel Exchange
rrcc5uuudhh4oz3c.onion
Some discussion forums accessed via
Tor are distinctly unpleasant, but if
you’re interested in conspiracy
theories, leaked documents and
unreported global events, Intel
Exchange is one of the safest places
to read and share information. Some
threads are amusingly bonkers –
‘Cthulhu for President’, ‘Telekinesis –
everyone can do it’ and ‘Building
a spaceship’, for example – but by
insisting users register and have their
accounts verified, the forum generally
avoids the spam, trolls and
timewasters that plague many boards
on the standard web.
Blockchain
blockchainbdgpzk.onion
You need to invest in cryptocurrency
to buy and sell through hidden sites,
and Bitcoin is by far the most popular
option. Blockchain serves as a free
virtual wallet for your
currency and
provides lots of useful
idata such as the
current market price,
graphs of Bitcoin-
mining activity and
details of transaction numbers.
Unusually, for an onion site, it has an
official HTTPS certificate, for peace of
mind about your Bitcoin savings.

Robert Irvine says:
When I told colleagues that our next cover
feature was about Tor, their reactions were
a mix of concern and incredulity. “But isn’t that really
dangerous?” asked Colin, while Joel wondered if it was
wise “to tell readers where to buy guns and drugs and, er,
ivory”. It’s certainly true that Tor is closely and irrevocably
linked to the Deep Web or, more specifically, the section of it
known as the Dark Web – “the online version of a murky corner of a Sixties East
End pub” (The Sun, 12 March 2014). I admit I had my reservations when I first fired
up Tor Browser to take a look around. Would I be bombarded by horrific images
and criminals touting their wares? Were the police already alerted and on their
way? Should I flee back to the safety of Chrome and cry: “You can have my private
data, Google – it’s not that interesting anyway!”? Well, no, as it turned out,
because Tor is very much what you make it.
Yes, there are unsavoury (to put it mildly) ‘onion’ sites that can only be accessed
through Tor, but as we’ve explained in this fetaure, there are also lots of useful
and legitimate ones whose purpose is to allow free and unmonitored access, and
sharing of information, not to wallow in and encourage depravity and criminality.
To view dodgy sites, you need to actively seek them out and know their – usually
very convoluted – ‘.onion’ addresses; they don’t simply pre-load themselves in the
browser, beckoning you to the dark side. I’m well aware that I could use Google in
any browser to quickly find photos of car-crash victims or ‘specialist’ pornography,
but I don’t because I have no desire to (and never have – honest, Mum!).
The purpose of Tor, as the developers themselves must be tired of saying, is to
let you browse the web as you want without having every move you make tracked,
your identity and location exposed, and your data harvested for the purposes
of advertising, scamming and spamming.
I’m not saying you shouldn’t be careful using Tor – as with many web tools,
there are dangers if you aren’t – but I managed to research and write this feature
without any exposure to the ‘horrors’ of the Dark Web, and chose to sacrifice
the anonymity that the browser bestowed on me to let you know I made it

Ensure your security
software is working
Don’t let malware infection be the first
sign of a security hole. The Anti-
Malware Testing Standards Organization
(AMTSO, www.amtso.org) offers
a Security Features Check that exposes
potential weaknesses in your system’s
defences. The check consists of six
tests, four of which involve downloading
files that your PC should identify as
malware and block automatically.
These files aren’t actually malicious but
are designed to be detected as such,
so if your anti-malware program lets
one through, then you need to tighten
your security settings.
Test your firewall for
weaknesses
Firewalls
generally run
quietly in the
background,
so it’s
important
to know that
they’re working
properly.
To test yours,
try to bypass it using the free online
port scanner GRC ShieldsUP (www.grc
.com/shieldsup). Ports should be closed
by default, apart from port 80 (or 443),
which is needed for web traffic. You can
choose to test either Common Ports
(only the most vulnerable ports) or All
Service Ports (a thorough scan of 1,056
ports). Green or blue results mean that
those ports are secure, while red ones
show open ports that need to be closed.
Make sure your plugins
are up to date
Security holes in Java, Adobe Reader
and Flash put your personal data at risk,
so ensure your plugins are up to date
by using Qualys BrowserCheck
(browsercheck.qualys.com). This scans
your browser and its plugins to detect
outdated versions and other security
problems. Click the Fix It button next to
scan results marked as ‘insecure version’
or ‘update available’ to install the
required updates. The test works with
all major browsers.
Check your Facebook
security
Facebook now offers a Security
Checkup tool that lets you review and
lock down your account. Go to bit.ly/
checkup432 and Facebook will tell you
whether you’re still logged into the
social network in a browser or app
you haven’t used for over a month.
You can also set up login alerts to be
notified via email if your account is
accessed from an unrecognised device
or browser.
Avoid being the
weak link in
your PC’s
protection by
keeping your
cybersecurity
knowledge up
to scratch.
There are lots of online quizzes
that test your ability to spot online
threats, including BT’s Security
Savvy test (bit.ly/savvy432),
the OpenDNS Phishing Quiz
(bit.ly/phishing432) and Silicon’s

48 20 Sept - 3 Oct 2017
What we liked:
It’s not the most modern
PDF reader or the most
full-featured, but
if you just want a fast,
no-fuss, everyday tool for
viewing PDFs (as well as
ebooks and digital comics)
on your PC, there’s no better choice
than Sumatra.
It’s a lightweight program – the
installation file is only 5MB – that’s
compatible with every version of
Windows and is incredibly fast to load.
Indeed, when we opened a range of
different PDFs, it was the fastest
program to launch every time. It can
also be run directly from a USB stick.
But what makes Sumatra really stand
out is its simple interface. The toolbar
contains only the most important
controls you need when viewing a PDF,
for zooming in and out, navigating
between pages and searching for words
that appear in the document (along with
buttons to print and open more files).
Click the main menu button and you’ll
be presented with a range of useful
options, such as the ability to display
your document as facing pages and
a book view, neither of which is
available in the PDF-viewing tools of
Chrome or Firefox.
Tabbed viewing is supported, so you
can open multiple documents at once
and easily switch between them, and
there are useful keyboard shortcuts you
can use to jump to the start or end of
the document, zoom to a page’s width,
or change the view mode.
We don’t normally need to annotate
PDFs so weren’t worried about Sumatra
lacking this functionality, but there’s a
handy built-in shortcut to open the
current document in Foxit Reader for
moments when you need a program
with more powerful tools.
How it can be improved:
Sumatra is the most dated-looking of
our award winners and it could do with
a facelift. It also lacks the annotation
tools that you find in most of its rivals.
OUR VERDICT
Sumatra’s simple, user-friendly
interface doesn’t overwhelm you
with unnecessary features. It’s also
one of the fastest PDF readers
you’ll come across.

Discuss PDF readers at forum.webuser.co.uk
What we liked:
Although they have the
same developer and
compete in the same
round-up, Foxit Mobile
PDF and Foxit Reader (see
below) are very different
tools. Foxit Mobile PDF is a
Windows app that’s only available on
devices running Windows 10 (and
Android and iOS phones and tablets).
As such, it lacks many of the features
of its counterpart, but it’s also faster
and easier to use.
The simple toolbar provides quick
access to a range of viewing modes
including night mode, for reading in the
evening; and various colour modes that
make the words on a page easier to see.
There’s also a handy thumbnail view,
which gives you an overview of your
entire document at a glance.
Foxit Mobile PDF also includes a
comprehensive range of annotation
tools, so you can highlight, underline,
draw, add stamps, insert text and add
notes to your PDFs. Like Reader, it also
lets you sign into services including
Google Drive, Dropbox and OneDrive
What we liked:
If we’d rated the programs
in this round-up on
features alone, then Foxit
Reader would be the
runaway winner. As well as
letting you read PDFs, its
comprehensive tools let you
annotate them, fill in forms and add
signatures to your documents. You can
even use Foxit Reader to create your
own PDFs from scratch, or convert
Word documents to PDFs.
Foxit Reader also lets you sign into
various cloud-storage services including
Dropbox, OneDrive and Google Drive,
thereby allowing you to have faster
access to your online files.
There are a lot of features to get to
grips with, so you need to spend some
time learning to navigate the program’s
ribbon menus. Like Sumatra, it lets you
pick from a range of view options
including facing pages and facing pages
with a cover (book view), and there’s
also a handy Read Mode that you can
use to hide some of the clutter in the
menus above.
How it can be improved
Foxit Reader didn’t wow us with its
performance. It was slower to open than
most of its competitors and we found
the Google Drive integration so slow
that it was almost unusable. There have
also been widespread concerns about
unpatched security flaws, although
these have now been resolved.
for faster access to documents stored
in the cloud.
How it can be improved
There’s no tabbed interface or option
to view a document as facing pages,
both of which can be important when
reading PDFs on a PC. We also found
the unlabelled annotation icons a bit
tricky to understand.
OUR VERDICT
Foxit Mobile PDF was really unlucky
not to win our Gold award, and it
certainly looks more modern than
Sumatra. It’s fast, easy to use and
offers some great tools, but lacks
some important viewing options.
OUR VERDICT
Foxit Reader provides an impressive
range of free tools but they’re
overkill for most people and unless
you need these advanced features,
they make the program
unnecessarily complicated for
everyday PDF viewing.
Microsoft Reader
bit.ly/reader432
Like Foxit Mobile, Microsoft Reader
is a fast, modern PDF reader that’s
available for free from the Windows
Store. It was unlucky not to win an
award,
but it
lacks
on-
screen
controls
for
zooming in and out – you need to
hold Ctrl while scrolling the mouse
wheel or pinch your fingers on the
trackpad to zoom, which isn’t for
everyone. However, we did like its
variety of view options and
minimalistic interface.
Chrome
bit.ly/chrome432
Chrome is the lightest on features
of all the tools in this round-up.
There’s no option to view pages
side by side or add annotations,
just a few buttons to help you
zoom in
and out,
and the
option to
search
for words
that
appear in the document. If you only
occasionally need to open PDFs
and don’t want to install any
additional software, it should serve
you well.
Adobe Acrobat Reader
get.adobe.com/uk/reader/
At first, Adobe Reader appears
to be the most full-featured and
straightforward of all the PDF
readers in this round-up, but we
have a major gripe with the fact that
it makes it very difficult to tell which
features
are free
and
which
you need
to pay
for. Some
premium features are clearly
labelled with ‘Learn more’ in the
Tools pane, for example, while
others only ask you to pay for an

you’ve already clicked the

Firefox Send
Firefox’s handy new Send tool (send
.firefox.com) makes sending large files
quick and easy – you just drag them to
your browser and share a link. What’s
more, because the files are set to
self-destruct after they’ve been
downloaded, you’ll never have to worry
about using up space in your cloud
storage or remembering to delete old
files that you’ve left online.
There’s no need to set up a Send
account or download any software to
use the service. Just visit send.firefox
.com in any browser (not just Firefox),
and drag and drop files of up to 1GB in
size to upload them and generate a
secure, encrypted download link. Each
link remains active for up to 24 hours
or until the file is downloaded, at which
point the link expires automatically.
You can review all your currently live
files by refreshing send.firefox.com.
If you need to share more than one file
and want to use a single link, you can
do so by archiving the files on your
computer first, provided they don’t
exceed the 1GB file limit.
Firefox Send isn’t much use for
sharing files with more than one
recipient, but a further upside of the
expiring links is that you know when
your recipient has received the file.
Snapmail
There are plenty of services for sending
self-destructing text messages from
your phone, but finding an app that’ll do
the same when you send an email from
your computer is a little trickier. One of
our favourite tools is Chrome extension
Snapmail, which lets you send emails
Sharing private content online can be a worry because your data
could end up in the wrong hands. Edward Munn picks the best
tools for leaving no trace of your confidential files and chats
from Gmail that disappear automatically
after 60 seconds. Install the extension
from the Chrome Web Store (bit.ly/
snapmail432) and when you compose
a new email, simply click the Snapmail
button instead of Send. The recipient
receives a secure link to the message
and once opened, it’ll expire within one
minute. The extension will only encrypt
text, so if you want to send images or
other attachments, then you’re better
off using Firefox Send.
Self-Destructing Cookies (bit.ly/
sdcookies432) is a handy Firefox extension
that protects you from trackers by deleting
website cookies as soon as you close the
relevant tabs. The extension was last
updated in March of this year, but support
for it has been discontinued so it will only
work with Firefox versions 54 and earlier.
If you want something that’ll work with
the newest version of Firefox, try Cookie
AutoDelete (bit.ly/cookiea432), which is also
available for Chrome (bit.ly/cookieac432).
This lets you whitelist the cookies that you
trust as well as automatically deleting those
you don’t, whenever you close a tab.

Firefox Send lets you send download links

Telegram
If you need to share passwords or other
private information with loved ones,
then Telegram’s (telegram.org) Secret
Chat gives you the confidence that this
information won’t end up in the wrong
hands. Secret Chat not only offers
end-to-end encryption, but also blocks
forwarding of content and lets you set
your messages, photos, videos and
other files to self-destruct a specified
amount of time after they’ve been read
or opened.
To start a new Secret Chat on an
Android device, open Telegram’s main
menu and select New Secret Chat. On
iOS, tap the icon in the top-right corner
in Messages, then choose New Secret
Chat. Next, choose the recipient and set
the self-destruct timer by tapping the
clock icon (in the top bar on Android
and in the input field on iOS), then
choosing the desired time limit. Now,
when you send a message or file, it’ll
disappear
according to
this timer.
It’s worth
noting that a
Secret Chat is
device-specific,
so if you start
one on your
Android phone,
it’ll only be
visible there,
not on your
other devices.
Any messages
you send
before setting
the self-
destruct timer
will remain
visible to the
recipient unless you manually delete
them. To do this, long-press the
individual message (not the chat) and
choose Delete. Photos sent with an
expiry time of less than a minute are not
available to download and screenshots
are also blocked.
Telegram is undoubtedly one of the
most secure options for sending
self-destructing messages on your
phone or tablet, but if you also want the
option to protect a specific Secret Chat
with a PIN code, try Viber (www.viber
.com) for Android or iOS.
Facebook Messenger
If you want to send end-to-end
encrypted, self-destructing messages,
you don’t even have to download
a dedicated messaging app (such as
Telegram) because both these features
are now supported by Facebook
Messenger. To open a ‘Secret
Conversation’ in Messenger for Android,
open a normal conversation with the
person you want to share private
information with, then tap the info
button and choose ‘Go to Secret
Conversation’. Like Telegram, Messenger
lets you send messages, photos and
videos in Secret Conversations, but
there’s no support for other files.
To set the self-destruct timer, tap the
stopwatch in the text-input field and
choose the time when you want
messages to disappear. Before typing
your message, you’ll see the text-input
field clearly marked with ‘disappearing
message’. Unlike Telegram, there’s no
option to manually delete messages
from the recipient’s device that you
didn’t set to self-destruct, and recipients
can still use screenshots to capture your
self-destructing content.
iMessage
Apple iMessage’s ‘Invisible Ink’ feature
lets you make messages invisible until
the recipient chooses to reveal them,
but there’s no option to set them to
self-destruct, which means it only offers
added fun and not security. However, it
is possible to create self-destructing
messages in iMessage by installing the
third-party app Confide (getconfide
.com/download). Tap the Apps icon in
iMessage, then tap the Additional Apps
option before tapping the ‘+ Store’ icon.
Once you’re in the store, tap the search
icon to search for Confide, then install it.
To send a self-destructing message
with Confide, tap the Apps icon again,
then swipe right until you see Confide.
Select Get Started and you can then
choose whether you want to send a
self-destructing message or photo.
After entering your message, tap
Continue, then the Send button in
iMessage. The message appears as
an iMessage attachment on the
recipient’s device, unless they don’t
have Confide installed, in which case
they’ll see a link they can tap to install it.
Swiping your finger across a message
reveals it and you can only view each
message once, after which it
automatically self-destructs.
If you find the process of sending
Confide messages in iMessage a little
clunky, you can just use the Confide
app directly, providing your recipient
has it, too. It’s also available for
Windows, MacOS and Android using
the same link.

llp is billed as a rival to IFTTT (If This
Then That, ifttt.com), but it offers
better Windows integration and lets
you quickly automate a number of
everyday tasks via its growing selection
of ready-made ‘cards’ (37 at the time of
writing). These perform actions such as
cleaning up files you’ve accidentally
downloaded twice; displaying a warning
if your email address is involved in a data
breach; opening a YouTube playlist when
you plug in your headphones; and freeing
up space when your hard drive is almost
full. You can choose the tasks you want
to use (they are sorted into categories),
and edit them to suit your needs.
Ellp is currently still in beta but we
found it to be stable and problem-free.
Automate PC tasks with one click

Ellp has lots of PC-specific options.
Under Productivity, there are cards

The first time you run Ellp, you’ll be
prompted to enter your name or
nickname, although you can skip this
step if you wish. You’ll also be given
the option to get early access to future
Ellp cards by entering your email
address. The program then loads
a selection of popular cards. 1
2
The bar at the top lets you view the
newest additions 1 or explore the
cards by category. 2 The choices on
offer are All, Productivity, Performance,
Security and Entertainment. 3 Browse
the selection of cards until you find one
that sounds interesting, then click it to
find out more.
3
Each card offers a statement, with
the action to perform in bold. For
example, ‘When my Recycle Bin is filling
up, keep it clean.’ You will often have the
option to edit a selected task, such as
specifying how old items in the bin need
to be. 1 Click Activate Card 2 to action
the task.
Ellp is a simple yet powerful free tool that saves
you time by quickly automating many tasks on
your PC. Here’s how to get started with it
4
The sidebar on the right provides
handy information and tips, such as
the number of other people using
a particular card. A congratulations
message appears when you activate your
first task and it suggests cards that other
people use. 1 Edit the task or deactivate

Protect and maintain
your hard drive for free
2
Work through each step of the wizard, choosing your
options as you go. You’re forced to click the Next button
1 after choosing the options on each tab, but once you
reach the end of the process, you can move freely between the
previously completed tabs if you want to go back and change
any of the settings you selected.
1
The first tab in the software is ‘Backup & Recovery’, where
you can perform one-off backups 1 or create a backup
job. 2 The process for both is the same, but the backup
job option adds a Schedule tab 3 to the bar across the top of
the Wizard.
3
The Schedule tab looks complicated but the settings are
automatically populated when you select the frequency
of the backup. 1 If you choose Weekly Backup, 2
for example, you’ll need to set the time and day, 3 the type
of backup (full or only incremental changes) and how many
backups to keep. 4
4
When backups have been set up or are running, you can
see them in My Activities. 1 Click a job and a box pops
up showing more information about it. From here, you
can edit, delete, deactivate or initiate the job. 2

aragon Hard Disk Manager has all the tools you
need to run and maintain your hard drive, from
the moment you buy it to the moment it dies.
The software covers everything from making partitions
(compartmentalising your hard drive so you can split it
into separate virtual drives) and creating backups, to
migrating your files to a new drive and, when it’s
reached the absolute end of its life, wiping the drive
so you can safely dispose of it.
Although this is a preview version, and a paid-for
upgrade is due for release later in the year, Paragon
has stated that this version will stay free forever,
as long as you don’t need technical support.

The Partition Manager tab works in much the same way.
If you have a hard drive with a partition and want to
create more, choose ‘Split partition’. 1 The new sizes are
chosen automatically depending on what you’re copying
across, or you can hover your mouse over the gap 2 and drag
left or right to change their size.
6
Choose whether to give the new partition a drive letter,
so you can use it as a virtual drive in its own right. 1
If you change your mind, you can merge the partitions
back together again. 2 The software also has a tool for
recovering deleted partitions.
7
The Disk Wiper tab offers a couple of different scenarios.
If you are removing a drive from your PC to throw away or
pass on to someone else, choose ‘Wipe out all the data’. 1
Or you can choose to only wipe the free space on your drive, 2
to thoroughly erase deleted files.
8
On the Algorithm tab, you can select the type of wiping
you want to use, 1 which dictates how thoroughly the
wipe is performed. Some wipes take longer than others,
so keep an eye on the ‘Approximate wipe time’. 2
10
If you’re installing the software to provide technical
support to another person, you should encourage
them to use the X-View tab. 1 This has a scrolling
menu that works by topic, rather than broad function. The
wizards are the same but they appear full screen, so they’re
easier to follow and harder to deviate from.
9
On the Drive Copy tab, the Migrate tool 1 lets you make
an exact copy of a drive. This is handy if you want to
replace a system drive without reinstalling Windows.
There are options to copy only the OS and programs, 2
the whole drive 3 or just a specific partition. 4

Find the video you want to edit (it has to be one you’ve
uploaded to YouTube yourself) and click the Edit Video
button. Select the Enhancements tab, 1 then ‘Blurring
effects’. 2 Click the Edit button 3 in the ‘Blur faces’ section. 2
Google will process the video, looking for faces it can blur
automatically. Thumbnails of these faces appear on the
left. 1 Click to select any that you’d like to blur. 2
Alternatively, you can ‘Select all’ or ‘Deselect all’. 3 Watch the
video to make sure the correct faces have been blurred.
3
When you’re happy with your blurs, click the Save button.
The system isn’t perfect so you may still find faces and
other details – such as car registration plates or other text
– that you’d like to blur. To pick out your own selections, click
the Edit button next to ‘Custom blurring’. 1
4
The video will play in a new window. When you see
something you’d like to blur, click and drag a box around
it. 1 Continue playing the video and the box should
follow the object around the screen. The length of time it
appears on the screen is shown in the timeline below. 2
5
You can blur more than one item at a time. When the next
thing you want to blur appears, draw a box around it as
before. 1 The other selections will turn grey 2 but you
can still click to further adjust them if you need to.
6
You can also use the timeline to adjust the length of time
a blur stays on screen. If a blur appears too early, go to
the frame where you’d like it to start and drag the left side
of the box that’s highlighted red in the timeline 1 to the vertical
line marking the current frame. 2 Click the Done button.

I
t’s great to share videos of your family and friends online
but sometimes you’ll find details in the background – or

ones, and it will terminate the Home
product for good in October 2018. If
you’re a CrashPlan for Home user, you’ll
need to take action and switch to
another online backup service. Thankfully,
Code42 has gifted all its subscribers
a 60-day free extension to give them
time to make the move elsewhere.
Code42 also has a couple of migration
options for CrashPlan for Home users.
The first is to simply switch to CrashPlan
How to...
Switch your online
backup service
Now that CrashPlan has shut its door to home users, Wayne Williams
explains the ups and downs of switching cloud backup services
Options for CrashPlan users
CrashPlan for Home (www.crashplan
.com) was one of the better cloud
backup services, offering pretty much
everything sensible PC users could wish
for. However, parent company Code42
recently announced plans to shut down
the popular service in order to focus
on its more profitable business sector.
The company is no longer offering new
subscriptions, nor is it renewing existing
I
t’s important to back up your personal files on a
regular basis because you never know when disaster
will strike. Corrupted files, crashes, hard-drive failure
and malware attacks can all lead to your data being lost
forever. There are plenty of backup tools and services to
choose from – some free, others not – and you have the
option of backing up your files locally (to another drive,
over a network or to DVD) or to online services that keep
your data in the cloud. The latter option is arguably
better, because it means you can access and restore your
files securely from anywhere, and your backup will
survive disasters such as fire and theft.
If you already use an online backup service but want to
switch to a different one, we show you how in this
Weekend Project. If you don’t currently have an online
backup plan, we’ll also show you how to get started.
for Small Businesses (you don’t need to
be a small business to use the service –
individuals are just as welcome). This is
the seamless option; if your backup is
under 5TB it will be transferred across
so you won’t need to upload it again.
You’ll get the remainder of your current
subscription for free, then 75% off the
usual price for the following 12 months.
CrashPlan for Small Businesses usually
costs $10 (around £7.66) a month for

each device, and you can make the
switch by going to bit.ly/crash432 and
following the instructions.
If you don’t want to move to CrashPlan
for Small Businesses, the other option is
to migrate to Carbonite (www.carbonite
.com). It’s a similar service to CrashPlan
and users who make the switch won’t be
charged until their CrashPlan for Home
subscription expires (for up to 60 days).
On top of that, users are eligible for a 50%
discount on either Carbonite for Home or
Carbonite Core subscriptions. The basic
version of Carbonite for Home is usually
priced from $59.99 (around £46) a year
for one computer. To switch to Carbonite,
go to bit.ly/carbo432. and enter the email
address you use for CrashPlan for Home.
Carbonite should recognise you and
begin the migration process.
Of course, you’re not obliged to use
either service – you can back up your
computer to wherever you like. Once your
CrashPlan for Home subscription expires,
all data backed up with the service will
be automatically and securely deleted.

Before you start using Backblaze
(www.backblaze.com), you’ll need
to sign up for a free account. Once
that’s done, the installer downloads.
The program analyses your drives
during the installation process (be
patient, it takes a while), and reports
on what it proposes to back up. 1
Click OK 2 to start the backup.
2
The software displays the number of
files there are to back up, how many
are remaining and the file currently
being processed. 1 You can pause the
backup at any time 2 and view the
Restore Options. 3 Click Settings 4
to configure the software and change
the drive(s) to include.
3
There are tabs to manage backup
performance 1 and to set times
for backups to occur. 2 This is set to
Continuously by default. The software
will automatically exclude items such
as the Recycle Bin and system files,
but you can add further exclusions. 3

been backed up recently. 4
backups and no restrictions on file sizes
or restores. You can access your files
on an iPhone, iPad or an Android
device and it supports two-factor
authentication (2FA).
Unfortunately, there’s no magic tool to
migrate your backup from one service to
another, so it makes sense to run backup
services concurrently until your data has
transferred from your PC to your new
service. We show you how to
get started with Backblaze in
our Mini Workshop, below.
Use an existing cloud
service
Cloud-storage services such as
OneDrive and Google Drive are
primarily designed for syncing
files, but if you’re already
signed up, you could also use
your account to back up your
files. Arq (www.arqbackup.com)
is a tool that can turn whichever
service you choose into fully
featured backup service.
Moving from CrashPlan for Home to CrashPlan for Small
Businesses is very easy to do...
… and moving your backup from CrashPlan to Carbonite is equally
straightforward
If Backblaze backups are taking too long, you can
adjust the upload speeds
MINI WORKSHOP | Back up your hard drives with Backblaze
Switch to Backblaze
If you’d rather try something different,
consider subscribing to Backblaze (www
.backblaze.com). There’s no reason why
online-backup services should cost the
earth, and Backblaze is among the better,
more affordable solutions. Available for
Windows and Mac computers, it costs
just $5 (£3.82) a month or $50 (£38.24)
per year, and provides unlimited cloud

Download and install the Arq trial,
then run it. Enter a username and
email address, then click the Start Trial
button. You’re prompted to select
a destination type. You can choose
from any of the major storage services
(such as Google Drive or OneDrive) 1
or a folder on your hard drive. 2
2
Click Continue. If you selected an
online service to back up to, you’ll be
able to sign into it. In this Workshop,
we’re backing up to Google Drive, so we
just need to enter an email address
(or phone number) and password.
Arq then needs permission to manage
files in Drive. 1
3
In the pop-up window, select Set
Up Backups. Enter a secure
password (twice) that will be used to

The Edit Destination window lets you

MINI WORKSHOP | Back up your PC to Google Drive with Arq
It works in much the same way as
the likes of CrashPlan and can back up
your entire hard drive or just selected
folders. Arq itself charges a one-time fee
of $50 (£38) per user, and you will need
to consider upgrading your choice of
storage service to a paid-for plan on top
of that, because the amount of free
space on offer probably won’t be
enough. Arq’s features page (bit.ly/
arqcompare432) provides a handy guide
to supported services including Amazon
Cloud Drive, Google Drive, Dropbox
and OneDrive, so you can see at a glance
how they compare for both free and
paid-for storage.
If you’re not sure whether Arq is able
to perform everything you require from
a backup tool, you can try it free for
30 days. We show you how to get started
in our Mini Workshop, below.
How long will it take to back up
a drive?
If you’re switching to an alternative online
backup service or signing up to one
for the first time, then you’ll need
to run a full backup, which will probably
take a considerable amount of time
to complete, depending on the speed
of your internet connection and the
number of files you
need to back up.
To give you an idea
of the sort of timescale
you’re looking at,
Backblaze has a tool
to check your
bandwidth. To run
its speed test, go to
bit.ly/blst432 and it
will measure your
download and upload
speeds, as well as ping
and jitter, and give you
an estimate of how
much data you can
expect to back up
in a day. This is only
a guide, though,
because speeds will vary depending
on what other uploading and
downloading you’re doing at the same
time. Uploads may also be slower with
other backup services. Our upload
speed was recorded as 7.8Mbit/s and
Backblaze estimates that this allows us
to back up 84GB per day. That means
a full 1TB drive will take around 12 days
to back up online. Carrying out a spot
of housekeeping in advance, to remove
duplicates and non-essential files, will
help speed up the process and you
might find uploads are faster at other
times of the day (such as at night).
After the initial full backup is complete,
only files that have changed will need
uploading, and this will happen in the
background.
Check which cloud service is best for Arq backups by comparing them on the website
Backblaze can test your upload and download speeds to give
you an idea of how long a full backup will take

The trick is to use the Edge browser
and OneNote. Open Edge and, if you
don’t already have the OneNote
extension, click the three-dot menu
and click Extensions. Click ‘Get
extensions from the Store’ and install
OneNote Web Clipper.
Click the OneNote button and the
whole page, even parts off the screen,

creen capture is an incredibly useful tool
that lets you take a snapshot of anything
that’s displayed on your monitor, whether
that’s an image, a website, a receipt for
something you purchased online or the settings
for a particular program. Simply press the Print
Screen key (sometimes shortened to Prt Scn)
on your keyboard and the screen is copied to
the clipboard as an image that can be pasted
using Ctrl+V. You can paste it into any software
that supports images, including Paint, Paint.NET,
Word, WordPad, Photoshop and so on.
To capture just the active window, such as
a web browser, press Alt+Print Screen. In
Windows 10, you can also save the whole
screen directly to the hard drive as a PNG file
by pressing Windows+Print Screen. It will be
saved to the Screenshots folder in your Pictures
folder. Open the folder and double-click the
screenshot to view it.

Use Windows 10’s Game bar
Windows 10 has a feature called ‘Game

when you’re playing games. Start a
game and press Windows+G to show
the Game bar, then click the camera
icon to take a screenshot. You can also
perform this without launching the
Game bar first, by pressing
Windows+Alt+Print Screen instead.
Game bar saves screenshots in the
Captures folder of your Videos folder.
Capture web pages
Windows 10 provides an excellent way to
capture web pages but it’s far from
obvious. Most web pages are larger than

TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL
More advanced tips for when you’re feeling brave
perform a range of tasks. One of the
tools can grab the screen, annotate it,
then save it to your hard drive. If you
can’t see the Windows Ink Workspaces
button in the notification area at the right
of the taskbar, right-click an empty part
and select ‘Show Windows Ink
Workspaces button’.
Whenever you want to take a
screenshot, click the button in the
notification area, then click ‘Screen
sketch’ in the panel. The ballpoint pen,
pencil and highlighter tools let you draw
on the screen, so you can highlight
different areas or points of interest. Click
the tool to select it and click it again to
select the colour and line thickness. A
crop button is available to select just
part of the screen. Use the Save button
to save the screenshot.
Crop screenshots before you
grab them
There’s another great tool in Windows 7
and 10. Go to the Start menu and find the
Snipping Tool on the Accessories menu.
It opens a small window with a toolbar
on the Desktop.
The Snipping Tool is like a more
powerful version of Screen Sketch and
clicking the Mode button provides three
options: Free-form Snip lets you draw
a shape to crop to; Rectangular Snip lets
you click and drag a box over the area to
grab; and Windows Snip saves any
windows you click. Click the scissors icon
in the toolbar to snip the screen.
Like Screen Sketch, you can use
various pens and highlighters to draw on
the screen and annotate it. Click the Save
button to save your screenshot to the
hard drive; click the Copy button to save
it to the clipboard for pasting into other
applications. The Snipping Tool is
particularly useful when you need to grab
areas of the screen that fit an irregular
shape.
Click the arrow next to the Delay
button in the toolbar and you can grab
the screen immediately or after a delay of
1-5 seconds. This is useful if you want to
grab a menu that automatically closes if
you click away. Set the delay, open the
menu and, after a few seconds, the snip
tool captures it.
is a free open-source tool that
extends the Print Screen key’s tools
and offers many more output options.
Click ‘version history’ on the
downloads page to see the different
types, including the latest beta and
a portable version that extracts to
the Downloads folder and doesn’t
need installing.
Run Greenshot to add an icon to
the notification area, then click this
and select Preferences to see all the
keyboard shortcuts for capturing the
screen, along with dozens of other
settings. You can change the hotkeys
by clicking the boxes and pressing
your preferred key combination.
Print Screen doesn’t normally
capture the mouse pointer but
Greenshot has an option to include it.
When the screen – or part of it – is
captured, a menu appears that lets
you save the screengrab to Outlook,
OneNote, Word, Dropbox, Paint, the
printer and various other places.
Chrome screenshots
The Awesome Screenshot Chrome
extension (bit.ly/awes432) has some
advanced tools that make it useful for
grabbing web pages. Click the toolbar
button to display a menu with options
to capture the visible part of the page,
the entire page, a selected area and
so on. It goes further than the
OneNote method covered earlier.
The screenshot appears on a
browser tab, and you can annotate it
using a toolbar at the top. To blur
sections, click and drag the Blur tool
over them to hide personal
information, such as an email address.
Click Done and in the next window,
in the ‘Local save’ section, you can
save it to the hard drive or the
clipboard, or send it to the printer.
Move the Screenshots folder
Pressing Windows+Print Screen saves
your captured image to the Pictures/
Screenshots folder as a PNG file.
If you want to save your screenshot
to a different location, right-click the
OneDrive icon in the notification area
(it may be hidden in the pop-up tray)
and click Settings. Go to the Auto-
save tab and select the option to
‘Automatically save screenshots
I capture to OneDrive’. This is useful if
you want to view or open your saved
screenshots on another computer,
phone or tablet. The screenshots are
saved to OneDrive’s Pictures folder.
Another method is to open your
Pictures folder, right-click the
Screenshots folder and select
Properties in the menu that’s
displayed. Select the Location tab
and use the Move button to place the
Screenshots folder in another location
on your hard drive. If you change your
mind, the Restore Default button puts
it back in its original place.
More screenshot tools
Microsoft provides several ways
to grab screenshots in
Windows, but screen-
capture tools from
other companies often
include extra options.
For example, not all
keyboards have a Print
Screen key, particularly
if they’re not full size
or have been designed
for Apple machines,
so you may want
a tool that offers an
alternative method.

DVD writer for a tablet
Q
For several years I have taken
a small HP laptop and external Sony
DVD writer on my holidays. However,
following the current airline restrictions
on weight, I bought a Linx 10 64-bit
Windows 10 tablet, which is much
lighter, and have tried several external
DVD writers, some powered by the
tablet, others with a separate lead for
an external power supply. They work
at first but will not play or write DVDs,
and shut down after a few minutes.
Is this because the Linx tablet is 64-bit
or simply that the tablet and DVD writer
are not compatible?
Can you suggest a solution?
J Stirling, via email
A
You’re not alone in having problems
getting CD/DVD writers to work
with the Linx 10 tablet/laptop hybrid.
The power output from the Linx 10 is
insufficient for an external CD/DVD
drive so you need a mains-powered USB
hub that can deliver 2A (sometimes
listed as 2,000mA) through at least one
of the ports. Prices vary, but we have
seen them for under £20 at Maplin,
Amazon and other retailers.
Do you really need to take a DVD
writer on holiday? If you want to watch
movies or listen to music, streaming is
much easier. There are paid-for music-
streaming services or you can upload
your own music to Google Play Music
(bit.ly/music432) and stream it to any
computer, phone or tablet. If you are
writing photos and videos to disc, save
them in an online-storage service –
OneDrive or Google Drive, for example
– and write them to DVDs when you
return home.

Secure your PC with Windows
accounts
Q
My PC is just over five years old and
runs Windows 7 Home Premium.
It was built for me at a local computer
dealer and is very reliable. It was set up
with one User Account with ‘brian’ as
the Administrator. I have never felt the
need to set up any further accounts or
add a password because only my wife
and I use the PC.
Normally, when I boot up my
computer, it displays a couple of general
screens before reaching the Desktop
and being ready to use. Some time ago,
it suddenly, on occasion, began to
display another screen during the
boot-up procedure. This screen has
a button and doesn’t progress to the
Desktop until I’ve clicked it.
During the last couple of weeks, an
additional screen – I believe it’s the login
screen if you have a password set up
– has started appearing. I can’t think
why this is happening. I’m not aware of
changing any settings in Windows and
I’ve scanned with Avast Free (bit.ly/
avas432), Malwarebytes (www.
malwarebytes.com) and CCleaner (bit
.ly/ccle432) to check for any problems.
I am completely up-to-date with all
Microsoft’s updates to Windows 7.
What could be causing this and are
there any settings I should change?

I recently bought a new PC and
was impressed that the info in my
mail folders automatically transferred
from my old Windows 10 PC when I
logged in. However, it didn’t transfer
my list of contacts. After several hours
of wasted effort, I eventually did this
manually, one contact at a time. So
imagine my horror when the new PC
had a problem, which it fixed, but in
the process wiped all my contacts. I
have now manually restored them
again. How do I back them up?

Contacts are best stored online
in Outlook People. Go to outlook
.live.com in a browser, click the menu
button in the top-left corner to show
all the tiles and click People. It can
also be accessed from Outlook.com
email by clicking the people icon
at the bottom of the sidebar.
Outlook People’s tools can add and
delete contacts, tidy up contacts,
connect to social networks, view
contacts by social network and more.
The Manage menu lets you export and
import contacts. Use ‘Export contacts’
to download a copy of your contacts
to a PC or to restore contacts from
a file on your hard drive.
All your Microsoft services and
software use this contacts database,
including the Mail and People apps on
your PC. Press Windows+i to open the
Settings app, then click Privacy and
Contacts. Make sure that the switch to
allow apps to access your contacts is
turned on, and ‘Email and accounts’
is also set to On. Select Email in the
sidebar and set People to On.
The Mail and People apps will now
sync your contacts and you won’t lose
them because they’re stored online.

screen and go straight to the Desktop.
Type control panel into the search

there is only one Administrator account.
It shouldn’t be necessary, but there is
another way to specify that no
password is required. Press Windows+R,
type netplwiz and press Enter. Clear
the tick in the box next to ‘Users must
enter a username and password to use
this computer’.
We recommend that you set
a password for your account and also
create a second administrator account
in User Accounts in the Control Panel.
A second account means that you can
access your computer if there is ever
a problem with your first account.
Setting a password may seem
unnecessary for you and your partner
but if the computer is stolen, you’ll be
glad you did. It’s unlikely to happen, but

Word tools to adjust the brightness,
colour, contrast, cropping and so on,
but this takes a long time. I wondered
if there is an easier way to do this?

Photo enhancement in Word is
pretty good and includes tools for
picture correction, colour, crop and
rotate, and special effects such as
shadow, reflection, glow and more.
However, adjusting each photo is
slow work if you have a lot of them.
Paint.NET (www.getpaint.net) is a
good free photo editor and its tools
are more powerful than Word’s, but
it won’t save much time and effort.
The only way to make the job easier
would be to use an automation tool.
XnConvert (bit.ly/xnc432) is free and
offers a list of around 80 actions,
such as resize, contrast, brightness,
saturation, crop, sharpen and so on.
If you have a bunch of photos with the
same problem – such as being too
dark – you can create a script in
XnConvert to lighten them all
simultaneously. It can also resize them
and adjust the contrast at the same
time. However, the actions you pick
are applied to all the photos you
select, so it is only useful if they all
require the same adjustment.

Access a locked Microsoft
Money account
Q
A very long time ago, I used
Microsoft Money for all my finances.
When Microsoft stopped maintaining
the service, I switched to another
money-management tool and I’ve now
forgotten my Microsoft Money
password. Is there any way I can find the
lost password I used over 20 years ago
to get access to my historical financial
records? I tried a suggestion about five
years ago but was unsuccessful.
Brian Alexander Todd, via email
A
Microsoft Money was discontinued
in 2009, although a Sunset version
was made available so it could be used
for a while longer. Getting Money to run
at all is a problem because it’s not
compatible with recent versions of
Windows unless you hack the Registry.
You may get it running on an old PC
with an old version of Windows, though.
Money may be locked with a Microsoft
account password, so try using your
password for Outlook, OneDrive or other
Microsoft services. If that doesn’t work,
you’re out of luck. There is no simple
way to access Money files without the
password, and this is intentional.
This fortnight Roland has been trying out the new tools in Microsoft’s latest test version of the Autumn Creators Update

whether users need to enter a password

For anyone like me who struggles to read

Click the three-dot menu and click the

TOP TIP
A few issues ago, there was a tip
about using the Google Location
History timeline to retrace your
movements on a particular date
and even find the route you took
to visit a particular place.
I’ve since discovered some
more ways you can use this location
data. If you want to see when you last
visited a golf course, restaurant or
hotel, just search for it in Google Maps,
tap its business page and Google
should tell you how many weeks or
months it’s been since you were last
there. Tap the entry to see a detailed
summary of all the dates for when you
previously visited. This is much easier
than scrolling endlessly through a
timeline trying to work out when you
last visited a place.
Another way to take advantage of
Google storing your location data is to
Geotag your photos with Google
Location History
PHOTOS
use the info to manage your photos.
Provided you had your phone with you
when you used your camera, you can
upload all the snaps to Google Photos
and it’ll estimate the location based on
their timestamps. It’s a really handy
tool if you want to type ‘Paris, France’
into Google Photos and see not only
the snaps you took on your
smartphone but also all those you took
on a regular camera, without manually
tagging them in any way.

Sleep better at night
Several new reports claim that the

These windows are not just for hiding
your activities, they produce different

Usually, search engines look at your

Why is Malwarebytes Free

Q
I use Malwarebytes (www

in having Malwarebytes at all?

Malwarebytes can detect PUPs
(potentially unwanted programs)
and PUMs (potentially unwanted
modifications), which many antivirus
programs don’t, so for that reason it’s
worth keeping.
To stop Malwarebytes from launching
automatically on startup, press
Windows+R, type services.msc and

as Started and Automatic, right-click it
and select Properties, then use the
‘Startup type’ dropdown menu to change

Being a cuddy wifter is
alright with me
While catching up with back issues of
Web User after the holidays, I was
pleased to read your advice on ‘browsing
the web left-handed’ in Issue 430.
To be fair, I’ve never experienced
any difficulty in being a lefty, especially
when using my computer. The keyboard
I learned to use in my working days went
everywhere with me. I was even allowed
to keep it when I retired. When PCs came
along, it wasn’t a problem because the
keyboards were the same.
Whenever I use a computer at my local
club, I always adjust the mouse to
left-handed settings. Usually, I’d restore
its right-handed settings before leaving,
but one day I thought, what the hell, let
the next person change it back. Oh dear
me. The next person couldn’t get the
mouse to work and when I arrived, the
club’s resident technician was practically
on hands and knees begging me not to
do it again. I’m the only lefty there.
Web User’s tip to ‘move the scrollbar
to the left’ appeals to me. It’s never been
a problem as it is, but I’ll give it a try. The
rest of the tweaks and adjustments are
probably unnecessary for me, but I’d like
to thank Wayne Williams for a good read.
It was much appreciated.
When I was younger, I used to play
outside left at football and bat right-
handed at cricket. Does that make me
an odd ‘cuddy wifter’ as we lefties are
known in the North East? I also like the
Aussie version ‘mollydooker’ although,
as with much slang, its origin is uncertain.

Some ciphers are
unbreakable
Regarding the recent letter from Wilf
about ciphers (Inbox, Issue 429), I would
like to point out that there are several
unbreakable ciphers. The best known
is the one-time pad or Vernam cipher.
If used correctly, this is impossible to
crack. Messages encrypted using the
TypeX cypher machine, which improved
L
et’s get one thing straight:
left-handed people are not
‘southpaws’. This derogatory
North American expression is more
an insult than a simple synonym for
a left-handed person,
so I’m surprised to
find your publication
using it. This typifies
the attitude of
right-handers
towards left-handed
people, which is
often a mixture of
thoughtlessness
and disbelief.
Take, for example,
my work colleagues’
anger whenever
I leave the PC mouse
on the left of the
keyboard, and their
Left-handed people deserve more support
indignation when I point out that they
only leave the mouse on the right
because they’re right handed, so I leave
it on the left. “I’ll leave it on the right if
you put it on the left for me,” I tell them.
I once swapped the
left and right mouse
buttons round, as
described in your
article, and left them
like that for the next
user. This caused untold
chaos until I returned
to work two days later.
No one but my
left-handed colleague
realised what had
happened, and she
kept quiet, saying
afterwards that
watching staff try to
‘ﬁx’ the computer was
the best entertainment she’d had for
ages. I quietly switched the mouse
buttons back on my return and said
nothing. It was put down to a ‘virus’.
Your article highlights the abysmal
support for left-handed people. As you
point out, Microsoft doesn’t provide
a left-handed cursor, and I haven’t
been able to ﬁnd one for my MacBook.
A few welcome third-party programs
are available for making modiﬁcations,
but why should we have to go to such
lengths to switch even basic functions?
The “left-handed keyboard” in your
article is nothing of the sort. A true
left-handed keyboard – and any other
left-handed device for that matter –
would be a mirror image of the
right-handed version. This illustrates
the fundamental error in right-handers’
understanding of left-handedness.

Auto-playing adverts have
a negative eﬀect
In response to Barry Collins’ column in
Issue 431 about Facebook’s noisy
auto-playing adverts. This so-called
“feature” is absolutely disgusting, not to
mention dangerous.
I wake up early, but my wife doesn’t,
and this ridiculous unwanted feature
wakes her up and makes her angry
with me. Can you imagine what people
would say if your car beeped loudly at
any time of the day or night whenever
someone approached it or if another
car got close to it?
We’re already sick and tired of TV
commercials that blast out too loud
whenever they appear on the screen.

years, but I
have never
been in favour
of this type
of awful,
antisocial
behaviour.
I guarantee
that this type
of advertising
doesn’t result
in more sales;
on the contrary, it has a very negative
effect, and yet advertising idiots still use
it to compensate for their incompetence!

Why I’ll pass on a password
manager
Password managers (Issue 431) aren’t all
they’re cracked up to be. LastPass can’t
handle three-stage authentication
systems, and one of the sites I use doesn’t
allow you to save logins and passwords.
Instead, it provides a one-time security
number that I have to input to access the
site. LastPass also tries to save things
that aren’t the username or password.
I recently removed Kaspersky from one
of my computers because it kept telling
me that almost every site, including
Amazon, had an unsigned certiﬁcate.
I installed Norton
instead, which
has a password
security vault.
The problem is
that I always
close my
browser when
I’ve ﬁnished my browsing session, and
the vault closes too. This means that
whenever I relaunch my browser, I have
to sign back into the vault.

No justice for victims of eBay
car scams
I recently watched a very interesting TV
programme that investigated eBay
scammers. It’s well worth watching if you
can still ﬁnd it on the ITV Hub catch-up
service. Why eBay didn’t stop these
scams or make people aware of what
was going on is beyond me. Most of the
people in the programme had bought
cars through what they thought was
a genuine eBay page, parting with their
money on what seemed to be genuine
purchasing forms, only to ﬁnd that they
had been conned when the car wasn’t
delivered. One lady said she’d been
saving for years to buy a camper van
that looked like one of the old VW types,
only to ﬁnd that she had been ripped off.
It was heartbreaking to watch. The
victims were of all ages.
The criminals were caught but were
handed down what I can only describe
as laughable terms of imprisonment for
offences that, according to the police,
amounted to millions of pounds. The top
man only got ﬁve years, which means
he’ll probably only serve three and a half
years with remission. All the money had
left the UK, so it couldn’t be recovered,
which means the victims will only receive
a pittance, if anything, from recovery
sales under the Proceeds of Crime Act
(POCA). Needless to say, I shall avoid
online sales of cars from now on.

Give us free mobile Wi-Fi
during downtime
My broadband has been down since 7am
this morning, and my provider predicts
that it won’t be ﬁxed until 5pm.
Meanwhile, my home security system is
inactive, my NAS is down, I can’t access
Amazon Video or TV catch-up on my
smart TV and I have to connect my PC
to the internet over my phone’s Wi-Fi
hotspot, using data I have paid for.
Isn’t it time ISPs showed some good
will and commitment towards their
customers by providing everyone with
a mobile Wi-Fi router, such as MiFi,
that could be activated at no extra
charge when their internet is down?
After all, we’re paying for a service we
can’t use. Surely, the technology must
be available to allow mobile Wi-Fi to be
used for free during those times.
I appreciate that many people can’t
receive mobile broadband, so this
solution wouldn’t be of beneﬁt to them,
but I’m sure it would enable lots
of households to maintain
an internet connection
during
disruptions
to their
broadband.
I don’t see
why I should

a reasonably good answer and
a couple of videos, too.

‘How to put on a wetsuit’. I think the
real answer was ‘lose weight’, but I
was hoping for some arcane trick to
get that zip done up!

His parents have done an amazing job
of fundraising via social media, setting
up charity games and all sorts. Wouldn’t
it be a great thing if you could support
causes like this with something more
meaningful than a ‘like’? What about
a ‘penny like’ button where you donate
a penny to
whoever made
the tweet? It’s
such a trivial
amount that it’s
the kind of thing
you could do
without thinking,
but when you see tweets getting
hundreds of thousands or millions of
likes – as many of those concerning
Bradley Lowery did – then the sums
involved become substantial.
It’s not only charities that could reap
the benefits of penny likes. New tech
products could use penny likes as a
means of crowdfunding, in a similar
fashion to the way they use Kickstarter
and other such sites to get products off

the ground today. Campaigns or causes
– such as the benefit fund for the victims
of Grenfell Tower fire or the campaign
to save net neutrality – could use it as
a rapid way to raise funds. People could
even use it as a means to raise money
to run for Parliament, levelling the
advantage of the main political parties
who have been failing us for years,
and potentially releasing this country
from their stranglehold.
How does Twitter make money from
all this? Well, it can either take a
commission at the point of purchase,
selling us, say, 100 penny likes for £1.15.
Or it can take a slice if and when the
recipients decide to withdraw the funds,
much like the crowdfunding sites take a
fixed percentage of the revenue
pledged by backers.
It might not be enough to fill a $100m
loss every quarter, but it would go some
way to mending the damage. Now,
who’s going to give me a penny like
for my campaign to buy Katie a new
house in Pyongyang?
I’m more likely to buy
a hardback edition of Katie
Hopkins’ autobiography than
a pair of trendy trainers
I
f there’s one thing Twitter is brilliant
at – other than exposing what an
astonishing waste of atoms Katie
Hopkins really is – it’s losing money.
In the last ‘quarter’ alone, Twitter
managed to lose $116m on earnings of
$574m. That’s the equivalent of opening
a shop where every item costs you £1 to
make and selling it for 80p. It’s losing
money hand over fist.
Part of the reason for this is because
Twitter is terrible at advertising. I’ve just
opened Twitter on my phone and the
first ‘promoted’ tweet I see in my
timeline is a video of a 20-year-old
Game of Thrones star selling Converse
trainers. I’m a 40-year-old father of two.
I’m more likely to buy a hardback
edition of Katie Hopkins’ autobiography
than a pair of trendy trainers.
If you want to see how clueless
Twitter is about your ‘interests’, go to
the Twitter website, click your profile
icon, then Settings & Privacy and Your
Twitter Data, and then click your list of
interests. My 69 interests supposedly
include DJs (I once tweeted about
Jimmy Savile),
Amazing (whatever
the hell that means)
and Comics (I’ve
not bought one
since Jimmy Savile
was still allowed to
make regular
appearances in them).
How does Twitter get out of this
financial black hole? Well, if there’s one
thing other than generating debt that
Twitter excels at, it’s championing
people and causes. If you’re a football
fan like me, you can’t fail to have been
touched by little Bradley Lowery, the
super-smiley six-year-old lad who
tragically died from a rare type of
cancer earlier this summer.
