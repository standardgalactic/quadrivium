Internationalization 
Spring MVC

Internationalization
• Often abbreviated as i18n (I18N). 
• i + 18 characters in ‘internationalization’ + n 
• Localization - l10n (L10N) 
• Fairly broad topic 
• Languages, Currencies, Layouts

i18n with Spring MVC
• i18n in a Spring MVC context generally is looking 
at support for languages  
• Driven by ‘accept-language’ request header 
• ‘en-US’ - ‘en’ is the language code, ‘US’ is the 
country code

i18n Standards
• Language identiﬁers were established by RFC 3066 
in 2001 
• Language Codes are governed by ISO 639 
• ISO - International Organization for Standardization 
• Region codes are governed by ISO 3166 
• Can refer to countries, regions, territories, etc.

Locale Detection
• Default behavior is to use Accept-Language 
header 
• Can be conﬁgured to use system, a cookie, or a 
custom parameter. 
• Custom Parameter is useful to allow user to 
select language.

Locale Resolvers
• AcceptHeaderLocaleResolver is the Spring Boot 
Default 
• Optionally, can use FixedLocaleResolver 
• Uses the locale of the JVM 
• Available: CookieLocaleResolver, 
SessionLocaleResolver

Changing Locale
• Browsers are typically tied to the Locale of the 
operating system 
• Locale changing plugins are available 
• Spring MVC provides as 
LocaleChangeInterceptor to allow you to 
conﬁgure a custom parameter to use to change 
the locale. 

Resource Bundles
• Resource bundles (aka messages.properties) are 
selected on highest match order. 
• First selected will be on language region 
• ie en-US would match 
messages_en_US.properties 

Resource Bundles
• If no exact match is found, just the language code 
is used. 
• en-GB would match messages_en_GB.properties 
• OR if no ﬁle found, would match 
messages_en.properties 
• Finally would match messages.properties
